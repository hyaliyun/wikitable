Kilgour currently is the head coach of the Seneca WarChiefs (FNJBLL). He is from the Tuscarora Indian Reservation near Lewiston New York.  Player  Kilgour played for the Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League for eight seasons, before finishing his playing career with the Rochester Knighthawks and Albany Attack. As a player, he won three championships with the Bandits, and is the all-time team leader in penalty minutes and faceoffs. Kilgour's number '43' was retired by the Bandits in March 2001, making him the first player to have his number retired by an NLL team. He was inducted into the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame in 2007. In 1994, as a member of the Six Nations Chiefs, Kilgour was awarded the Mike Kelly Memorial Trophy as most valuable player in the Mann Cup competition.  Coach  Kilgour became head coach of the Washington Power for the 2001 season. He led the Power to the playoffs in each of his two seasons as coach before returning to Buffalo as their head coach after the 2002 season. The Bandits posted a 12-4 record in 2003, and Kilgour was awarded the NLL Coach of the Year Award (later renamed to the Les Bartley Award). The next year, after a mediocre 8-8 regular season, the Bandits caught fire in the postseason, making it to the Championship game for the first time since 1997, but lost the championship game to the Calgary Roughnecks losing 14-11. In 2005 the Bandits would again make it to the Champion's Cup final, this time falling short against Colorado Mammoth 16-9. Following the 2012 season, Kilgour was fired from his post as general manager of the Bandits, but continued to hold the position of head coach. A season later on June 10, 2013, the Bandits Director of Lacrosse Operations, Scott Loffler, informed Kilgour that he would not be retained as coach for the 2014 season. Kilgour has more wins than any other coach in NLL history, surpassing Les Bartley's 93 wins on March 12, 2010 with the Buffalo Bandits defeating the Toronto Rock 11-10 in overtime at Toronto's Air Canada Centre.

The Everybody Votes Channel was available on February 13, 2007. Its release came as a surprise, as Nintendo made no announcement regarding it until after it was available for download on the Wii Shop Channel.Nintendo Players - Nintendo Unleashes 'Everybody Votes' Channel Like the four other Wii channels, Nintendo ended support for the Everybody Votes Channel on June 28, 2013. Features whether the chicken or the egg came first: the majority of England, Scotland and Wales believe the egg came first; while the majority in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man believes it was the chicken. The Everybody Votes Channel featured general two-choice poll questions for users to answer. Three regional questions were offered, as well as one or more global polls; after a set time period, a question closed and was replaced by another one. New regional questions were posted every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Global questions were due to be posted twice a month, although to launch the channel two worldwide questions were released in quick succession. When accessing the main page of the Everybody Votes Channel, users were initially greeted with the current open polls and had the opportunity to vote with a registered Mii. Users were able to register a total of six different players on each Wii console using Miis to represent individuals in the household. The Channel recorded all of the votes cast by a player and allowed one to compare one's own opinions with those of one's family. Canadian results concerning if one would prefer to live by the Pacific Ocean or Atlantic Ocean. Atlantic Canada would prefer the Atlantic, while the rest of the country would prefer the Pacific. Within hours of a poll's closing, the results of the poll were made available. Vote ratios for each question were displayed on the Channel using Miis to represent different votes. A pie chart was used with 200 Miis to show how the vote panned out. Furthermore, for regional polls, a geographic breakdown was shown of which options were most popular in different areas; for example, a UK user would be shown results for Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, and in the US, the results of all 50 states and Puerto Rico were shown. These results were displayed on a map, with hues that indicated which option received the majority vote in each region. The hue was a deeper shade if the majority was more pronounced. The previous twelve polls that a user had voted on were archived so that one could check back on them after the polls had closed.HEXUS.gaming - Headline :: Everybody Votes Channel on Wii : Page - 1/1 =Statistics= In addition to casting a vote, users could also predict the outcome of the poll. Every correct prediction would be added to the player’s profile and used to calculate how \\"tuned in\\" he or she was with general public opinion, which was shown in the \\"How Tuned In Are You?\\" section. This number could range from 0 to 500, and was expressed as a \\"distance\\" from public opinion. The channel used Mii gender data to determine whether the player was male or female. Additionally, the user may have seen the percentages of votes in the two gender groups, which regions had the most popular vote, and prediction accuracy. =Worldwide polls= As well as the regional questions outlined above, the Everybody Votes Channel also featured worldwide poll questions. Worldwide polls were posted twice a month and ran for approximately two weeks, with live result updates that appeared within hours after the vote had closed. The results for worldwide polls were shown in a different format to regional polls. While Miis were used to illustrate the global vote ratio, a bar graph showed the results for each different country globally. Players could sort these results by vote percentage, country or in order of prediction accuracy. =Suggest a Question= The Suggest a Question section allowed players to suggest a poll question along with two possible answers to the question that they would like to see on the service. Each player was allowed one suggestion per day. Nintendo might have considered the question for future polls. These questions could not contain any personal, political, or religious information. =Wii Menu icon= The Everybody Votes Channel icon on the main Wii Menu has the most recent question and possible answers scrolling over the top. However, it only shows the National Polls; new Worldwide Polls do not show up on the icon. This lets users identify whether there has been a new question (and results) posted without entering the channel. The Everybody Votes Channel was the first channel to feature such an icon, which has since become a standard. The Forecast Channel, News Channel and Wii Shop Channel have since been updated to display a weather icon, news ticker, and new downloads, respectively. Reception IGN's Mark Bozon said \\"As a quick time-waster, Everybody Votes is a decent addition to the Wii console.\\" According to the developers of the Channel, the first worldwide poll received 500,000 votes in two days.

It is a launcher application that makes it possible to run non-Unicode (code page- based) applications in a locale of the user's choice. Since changing the locale normally requires a restart of Windows, AppLocale is especially popular with western users of Asian applications. The program installs itself in a subfolder of the Windows directory called \\"AppPatch\\", and when launched prompts the user for an executable to run and the desired codepage. It can also create a shortcut in the start menu, located under Microsoft AppLocale, however you will be prompted by AppLocale before the program's launch. AppLocale works with many, but not all non-Unicode applications, and as such is still inferior to really setting the particular locale systemwide. In particular, it requires fonts for the particular locale to be installed on the system it runs on, and Administrator privileges to be installed (though not to be used). It is not officially supported for use with Windows Vista or Windows 7; a person who is using Vista or 7 must either alter the system locale manually, or use an available unofficial workaround to install the AppLocale utility (see below). AppLocale is not included in normal retail versions of Windows, but is available for free download from Microsoft's website. Bugs =Compatibility= Running AppLocale on Windows Vista or Windows 7 is not officially supported and it fails to install on default configurations of these OS if attempted; however there is a workaround to install it (which requires starting apploc.msi file from command prompt under administrative privileges). This workaround also works for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. However, it no longer works on Windows 10. AppLocale cannot run on Windows 2000 platforms. In September 2016, Microsoft removed all pages referring to Applocale, including the official download, from the Microsoft website, thereby officially discontinuing all support (since it was only ever supported officially on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003). However, it can still be retrieved from the Internet Archive. =Mojibake issue= AppLoc.tmp in the AppPatch folder (%windir%\\\\apppatch) causes a Mojibake issue of Windows Installer.

It includes one urban settlement, the Sitakunda Town, and 10 unions, the lowest of administrative units in Bangladesh. It is one of the 15 upazilas, the second tier of administrative units, of the Chittagong District, which also includes 33thanas, the urban equivalent of upazilas. The district is part of the Chittagong Division, the highest order of administrative units in Bangladesh. Sitakunda is the home of the country's first eco-park, as well as alternative energy projects, specifically wind energy and geothermal power. Sitakunda is one of the oldest sites of human habitation in Bangladesh. During much of its history, it was ruled alternatively by various Buddhist rulers of Myanmar in the east and Muslims rulers of Bengal in the west. For a brief period in the 8th century, it was ruled by the Buddhist Pala Empire of India. The eastern rulers originated from the Kingdom of Arakan, the Mrauk U dynasty, Arakanese pirates and the Pagan Kingdom. The western rulers came from the Sultanate of Bengal and the Mughal province (Suba) of Bangala. European rule of Sitakunda was heralded by Portuguese privateers in 16th and 17th centuries, who ruled together with the pirates; and the British Raj in 18th and 19th centuries, who unified Sitakunda into the rest of the Chittagong District. Diderul Alam is the Current Member of parliament of Sitakunda Economic development in Sitakunda is largely driven by the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the railway. Though Sitakunda is predominantly an agricultural area, it also has the largest ship breaking industry in the world. The industry has been accused of neglecting workers' rights, especially concerning work safety practices and child labor. It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation, over-fishing, and groundwater contamination. The upazila is also susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, cyclones, and storm surges. It lies on one of the most active seismic faults in Bangladesh, the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault. Sitakunda is renowned for its numerous Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist shrines. It has 280 mosques, 8 mazars, 49 Hindu temples, 4 ashrams, and 3 Buddhist temples. Among its notable religious sites are the Chandranath Temple (a Shakti Peetha or holy pilgrimage site), Vidarshanaram Vihara (founded by the scholar Prajnalok Mahasthavir), and the Hammadyar Mosque (founded by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah). The attraction of Sitakunda as a tourist destination is elevated by these pilgrimage sites along with the hill range and the eco-park. Despite its diverse population, the area has gone through episodes of communal strife, including attacks on places of worship. There have been reports of activity by the Islamic militant group Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh since the early 2000s. History Early 19th- century painting of pirate boats anchored near Chittagong coast Sitakunda coast featured in a map from 1818 The legends of the area state the sage Bhargava created a pond (kunda) for Sita to bathe in when her husband Lord Ramchandra visited during his exile in the forests. Sitakunda derived its name from this incident. Sitakunda has been occupied by humans since the Neolithic era; tools associated with the prehistoric Assam group have been found throughout the area. In 1886, shouldered celts manufactured from petrified wood were discovered, as reported by Indian archaeologist Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay in his book Banglar Itihas, or History of Bengal, (volume I, 1914). In 1917, British mineralogist Dr. J. Coggin Brown uncovered more prehistoric celts. Large quantities of pebbles have also been found, but archaeologists have not determined whether they were used in the construction of prehistoric tools. During the 6th and 7th centuries CE, the Chittagong region was ruled by the Kingdom of Arakan. In the next century, it was briefly ruled by Dharmapala (reign: 770–810) of the Pala Empire. The area was conquered in 1340 by Sultan Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah (reign: 1338–1349) of Sonargaon, who founded the first dynasty of the Sultanate of Bengal. When Sultan Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah (reign: 1533–1538) of the last dynasty of the Sultanate of Bengal was defeated in 1538 by Sher Shah Suri of the Sur Dynasty, the Arakanese captured the region again. Batsauphyu (reign: 1459–1482) of the Mrauk U dynasty took advantage of the weakness of Sultan Barbak Shah of Bengal to lead the invasion. In this period, Keyakchu (or Chandrajyoti), a prince of Arakan, established a monastery in Sitakunda. Between 1538 and 1666, Portuguese privateers (known as Firinghis or Harmads) made inroads into Chittagong and ruled the region in alliance with Arakanese pirates. During those 128 years, the eastern coast of Bengal became a home to pirates of Portuguese and Arakanese origins. For a brief period in 1550, it was taken over by Pagan invaders. In 1666, Mughal commander Bujurg Umed Khan conquered the area. Along with the rest of Bengal, Sitakunda came under the rule of the British East India Company after the company's defeat of the Nawab of Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Rapid growth in the Bengali population since then resulted in an exodus of non-Bengali people from Sitakunda and its vicinity to the Chittagong Hill Tracts. (Master's thesis). During the Ardhodaya Yog movement, a part of the Swadeshi Indian independence movement, the governance of Sitakunda was briefly in the hands of Indian nationalists when, in February 1908, they took over the central government in Kolkata. In 1910, Indian Petroleum Prospecting Company drilled here for hydrocarbon exploration, the first such activity in East Bengal. In 1914, the first onshore wildcat well in Bangladesh was drilled at Sitakunda anticline to a depth of . By 1914, however, all four of the wells drilled had proven to be failures. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British colonial government (British Raj) replaced the governance of the East India Company. When the British withdrew in 1947, after creating the independent states of India and Pakistan, Sitakunda became a part of East Pakistan. The potential for a ship breaking industry first appeared in 1964 when Chittagong Steel House started scrapping MD Alpince, a Greek ship that had been accidentally beached near Fouzdarhat by a tidal bore four years earlier. On 15 February 1950, Hindu pilgrims form all over East Bengal, Tripura and Assam arriving for Maha Shivaratri were attacked by the Ansars and armed Muslim mobs and massacred at the Sitakunda railway station. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Sitakunda was part of Sector 1, led by Ziaur Rahman and Major Rafiqul Islam of the Mukti Bahini, the forces fighting for the independence of Bangladesh. The ship breaking industry began in earnest in 1974 when Karnafully Metal Works started scrapping Al Abbas, a Pakistani ship damaged in 1971, and flourished in the 1980s. As of 2007, Sitakunda had overtaken the ship breaking industries of India and Pakistan to become the largest in the world. In the early 2000s, Islamic militant organization Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) leader Siddikul Islam (also known as Bangla Bhai) ran militant training centers in the upazila at which participants learned to make bombs and handle firearms. One of his followers, Mahfuzul Huq, was captured on 21 February 2006. Geography and climate The Sitakunda range Road sign marking Sahasradhara spring and the eco-park Sahasradhara spring in Mid 19th century Sahasradhara spring in Early 21st century Sitakunda Upazila occupies an area of , which includes of forest. It is bordered by Mirsharai to the north, Pahartali to the south, Fatickchhari, Hathazari and Panchlaish to the east, and the Sandwip Channel in the Bay of Bengal to the west. The Sitakunda range is a long ridge in the center of the upazila, which reaches an altitude of above sea level at Chandranath or Sitakunda peak, the highest peak in Chittagong District. Part of Sitakunda is covered by the low hill ranges, while the rest is in the Bengal flood plain. To the north, Rajbari Tila at and Sajidhala at are the highest peaks in this range, which drops abruptly to a height of less than in the vicinity of Chittagong City to the south. About north of Sitakunda Town is the Labanakhya saltwater hot spring, which has been proposed as a source of geothermal energy. There are two waterfalls in the hills: Sahasradhara (thousand streams) and Suptadhara (hidden stream). Both have been identified as sites requiring special attention for protection and preservation by the National Heritage Foundation of Bangladesh. An area prone to cyclones and storm surges, Sitakunda was affected by cyclones in 1960, 1963, 1970, 1988, 1991, 1994 and 1997; the cyclones of 29 May 1963, 12 November 1970, 29 April 1991 made landfall. The intra-deltaic coastline is very close to the tectonic interface of the Indian and Burmese plates, as well as the active Andaman–Nicobar fault system, and is often capable of generating tsunamis. Cyclone preparedness measures are inadequate for the 200,000 residents of Sitakunda who were estimated to be living in high risk areas after the 1991 cyclone. For every 5,000 people, Sitakunda has only one cyclone shelter, each of which is capable of holding 50 to 60 people. Syedpur Union has eleven, Muradpur eight, Baraiyadhala seven, and Kumira five. Sitakunda municipality, Barabkunda, Bhatiary and Bansbaria have four shelters each. Salimpur has three and Sonaichhari Union has two shelters. The Chittagong Coastal Forest Department developed the river bars (char in Bengali) on the bank of the Sonaichhari channel adjacent to the Sitakunda coast into a kilometer-wide coastal mangrove plantation during 1989–90, to reduce the impact of cyclones. Although the site was initially unstable, rapid sediment accretion stabilised the soil, providing the coast with some protection. The cyclone of 1990 smashed about 25% of a sea-wall built using two-ton steel-reinforced concrete blocks, some of which were carried up to inland. In contrast, a mangrove plantation just south of the sea-wall sustained damage to less than 1% of its trees, most of which recovered within six months. The planted mangrove forest that helped Sitakunda to escape as one of the least damaged areas during the devastating 1991 Bangladesh cyclone is under threat from illegal tree-cutting by ship-breakers in the area. Annual average temperature is between and , with an annual rainfall of . Along with Chittagong and Hathazari, in June 2007 Sitakunda was badly affected by mudslides caused by heavy rainfall combined with the recent practice of hill-cutting. The mean annual wind speed recorded in Sitakunda between 1991 and 2001 was , as measured by the wind monitoring station built as part of a wind energy exploration project jointly run by the Local Government Engineering Department and the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies. A small 300-watt wind turbine, built by the government, provides electricity to fish farms. Geology Balanus balanoides The geological structure of Sitakunda, long and wide, is one of the westernmost structures of Chittagong and Chittagong Hill Tracts, delimited by the Feni River in the north, the Karnaphuli River in the south, the Halda River in the east and the Sandwip Channel in the west. The Sitakunda Range acts as a water divide between the Halda Valley and the Sandwip Channel. The -long Halda flows from Khagrachari to the Bay of Bangal, and is one of the six tributaries of Karnafuli, the major river in the area. Sandwip Channel represents the northern end of the western part of the Chittagong-Tripura Folded Belt. The structure contains a thick sedimentary sequence of sandstone, shale and siltstone. The exposed sedimentary rock sequences except limestone, thick in an average, provide no difference in overall lithology of Chittagong and Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Sitakunda fold is an elongated, asymmetrical, box- type double plunging anticline. Both the gently dipping eastern and steeper western flanks of the anticline are truncated abruptly by the alluvial plain of the Feni River. For a lack of infrastructure in Bangladesh, this anticline is one of the few regularly surveyed structures in the country. The syncline from Sitakunda separates the eastern end of the Feni Structure located in the folded flank of the Bengal Foredeep. Local experts consider the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault to be one of the two most active seismic faults in Bangladesh. After the earthquake of 2 April 1762, which caused a permanent submergence of of land near Chittagong and the death of 500 people in Dhaka, two volcanoes are said to have opened in the Sitakunda hills. During a seismic tremor on 7 November 2007, fire broke out at the Bakharabad Gas Systems Limited in the Faujderhat area of the upazila when a pipeline was fractured. The Girujan Clay Formation runs through Sitakunda at a thickness of . In the Sitakunda hills, the Boka Bil Shale Formation contains Ostrea digitalina, Ostrea gryphoides and numerous plates of Balanus (a type of barnacles), fragments of Arca, Pecten, Trochus, Oliva and corals. Both formations were identified and named by early 20th-century British petroleum geologist P. Evans. Demography According to the census of 2001, Sitakunda had a population of 298,528 distributed to 55,837 units of households (average household size 5.3), including 163,561 men and 134,967 women, or a gender ratio of 121:100. The average population of component administrative units of the upazila are 4,072 for wards, 1,666 for mahallas, 29,853 for unions, 5,060 for mouzas (revenue villages) and 5,060 for villages reported by the census. Out of the 69 mauzas here, 8 have less than 50 households, while 27 have more than 600 households. Of the villages, 8 have a population of less than 250, while 29 have more than 2,500. , the population density of Sitakunda was . Apart from the Bengali majority, there are a number of small communities of ethnic minorities in the area. Many of the resident Rakhine people are believed to have settled here during the Arakanese rule of Chittagong (1459–1666), though the event is not historically traceable. The Rakhine population in Khagrachari District migrated from the surrounding area and built up their permanent abode at Ramgarh in the 19th century. Other ethnic groups include the recently migrated Tripuri people. In the District of Chittagong that includes Sitakunda, the population ratio by religion in 2001 was Muslim 83.92%, Hindu 13.76%, Buddhist 2.01% and Christian 0.12%, with 0.19% following other religions. In 1981, it was Muslim 82.79%, Hindu 14.6%, Buddhist 2.23% and Christian 0.21%, with 0.19% following other religions. Chittagonian, a derivative of Bengali spoken by 14 million people mainly in the Chittagong district, is the dominant language. Administration Sitakunda as a thana came into existence in 1879, and was renamed to Sitakunda Upazila in 1983. It ranks third in area and sixth in population out of the 26 upazilas and thanas of Chittagong. Sitakunda Town, with an area of and a population of 36,650, is the administrative center and the sole municipality (Pourashabha) of Sitakunda Upazila. Shafiul Alam is the mayor of the town, gaining a landslide win over his nearest contender M Abul Kalam Azad in the 2008 mayoral election. The rest of the area is rural and organized into 10 Union Committees (Union Parishads), namely Banshbaria, Barabkunda, Bariadyala, Bhatiari, Kumira, Muradpur, Salimpur, Sonaichhari, Saidpur and Bhatiari Cantonment Area. The area is divided into 69 mauzas and 59 villages. Along with neighboring towns such as Hathazari, Fateyabad, Patiya and Boalkhali, Sitakunda Town was developed as a satellite town to relieve the increasing population pressure on Chittagong, with Bhatiari and Sadar unions selected as zones for industrialization, like South Halishahar and Kalurghat. (Urban Page). In the 2009 Upazila elections, Abdullah Al Baker Bhuiyan was elected the Upazila Chairman, while Advocate MN Mustafa Nur and Nazmun Nahar were elected vice chairmen. Sitakunda Upazila makes the 280th electoral district in Bangladesh, identified as Chittagong-3. In the 2008 general election, of Bangladesh Awami League (AL) was elected as the member of parliament, defeating his nearest opponent of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). In the previous election held in 2001, Siddiki had defeated Kasem. M Akteruzzaman is the Upazila Nirbahi Officer, the chief executive of the upazila. The upazila is served by a court presided over by a first-class magistrate. The Power Development Board is responsible for supplying electricity to the upazila, but due to power outages the industries in the area are strictly constrained. Anwarul Kabir Talukder, the State Minister for Power, lost his job on 29 September 2006 after hundreds of demonstrators in Sitakunda blocked the Dhaka–Chittagong highway in protest at the lack of electricity; violence also erupted elsewhere in Bangladesh. In case of fire, the services are brought in from the neighboring city of Chittagong. A proposed Kumira–Sitakunda Hill Water Reservoir Project to supply safe drinking water is to be undertaken by the government. Economy Ship breaking in Sitakunda Fishing boat in the Bay of Bengal The ship breaking industry in Sitakunda has surpassed similar industries in India and Pakistan to become the largest in the world. As of August 2007, over of iron had been produced from the scrapping of about 20 ships in the 19 functional ship yards scattered over along the coast of Sitakunda from Chittagong, near Fouzderhat. Local re-rolling mills, as well as similar mills, process the scrap iron. Bangladesh, with no local metal ore mining industry of its own, is dependent on ship-breaking for its domestic steel requirements; the re-rolling mills alone substitute for import of about of billets and other raw materials. There are 70 companies registered as ship breakers in Chittagong, employing 2,000 regular and 25,000 semi-skilled and unskilled workers. Organized under the Bangladesh Ship Breakers Association, (BSBA), these include companies within large local conglomerates that sought ISO certificates. The industry has come under threat, both from a decline in the number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7 ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8 ppm), chromium (220 ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9 ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6 ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2 ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57 ppm).DNV-Report: Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.Bruce A. Elleman, Andrew Forbes and David Rosenberg, \\"Piracy and Maritime Crime\\", page 124, Naval War College Employment of local people is low in the industrial facilities. The main occupations of the local people by industry are service (28.76%), commerce (21.53%), and agriculture (24.12%). Out of of cultivable land 25.46% yield a single crop, 57.95% yield double and 16.59% a treble crop annually. Bean, melon, rubber and betel leaf are the main agricultural exports. Fishing has traditionally been an industry restricted to low caste Hindus belonging to the fisher class, although since the last decades of the 20th century an increasing number of Muslims have joined the sector. Due to the introduction of engine-powered boats and gill nets, there was a rise in fish catches between the 1970s and 1990s, especially in the major fishing season (mid-July to mid-November). Over-fishing, however, has depleted the fish population and some fish species are facing extinction in the area, leading to seasonal food insecurity (February to April). According to a 2001 survey, 4,000 people in Sitakunda were engaged in wild shrimp fry collection, harvesting an average of five-and-a-half million fries a year. Sitakunda has a cement factory, 12 jute mills, 6 textile mills, 10 re-rolling mills, and 79 functional and defunct shipyards. Two of the operational jute mills are run by the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation, and one has been sold to a private sector company. To protest against privatization, workers of Hafiz Jute Mill, Gul Ahmed Jute Mill, MM Jute Mill and RR Jute Mill blocked the Dhaka–Chittagong Highway for seven hours in September 2007. As early as 1953, Sitakunda was described as the location for one of only five poultry farms in East Pakistan, along with Tejgaon (Dhaka), Narayanganj (Dhaka), Jamalpur (Bogra), and Sylhet. Some mining for sand from agricultural lands is carried out along the eastern side of the Dhaka–Chittagong road. Operators of local brick kilns are engaged in illegal hill cutting, a practice that was responsible along with heavy rainfall for the 2007 Chittagong mudslide. The rural poor are supported by Grameen Bank and NGOs such as CARE, BRAC and ASA. Transport and communication Dhaka–Chittagong Highway The Dhaka–Chittagong Highway runs through Sitakunda, connecting the two largest cities in Bangladesh. A workshop conducted by Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that improving the highway would increase Bangladesh's GDP by 1% and its foreign trade by 20%.News Release, This roadlink between the two cities existed in the pre-railway days and has been identified as a part of the medieval southern Silk Road. In 2006, ADB and the World Bank announced a plan to help Bangladesh build a second highway between Dhaka and Chittagong, which would be a part of the Asian Highway Network. Historically, the rail transportation system drove developments in Chittagong and the surrounding areas, including Sitakunda. The rail tracks were established as part of the Bengal Assam Railway in 1898, originally running from Chittagong to Badarpur, with branches to Silchar and Laksam. In September 1878, Sitakunda was included in the East Bengal Circle of Railway Mail Service (RMS) along with rest of the district. By 1904, the track system was extended to Chandpur to connect river boat traffic between Goalanda and Kolkata. Approximately of railroads stop at six rail stations. Currently, there is no express train service between Sitakunda and Chittagong, though intercity expresses (Sylhet–Chittagong, Chandpur–Chittagong, and Dhaka–Chittagong) stop at Sitakunda station and carry a small share of the commuter traffic load. By 2003, there were a total of of paved roads in the upazila, along with of mud roads, as well as five ferry- gauts or river docks for the use of barge-type ferryboats. The traditional bullock carts are now rarely seen in the upazila. Sitakunda was to be the landing station for a submarine communications cable, but the cable now comes ashore at Cox's Bazar. The cable has frequently been severed by miscreants, often in the Sitakunda area, since its installation on 21 May 2006. Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC) has brought internet services to the upazila by establishing Rural Knowledge Centres (RKC). BTTB and RanksTel run telephone services in the upazila. The telephone area code for Sitakunda is 3028, which has to be added to Bangladesh area code +880 when making overseas calls, and the subscriber numbers consist of four digits locally. Pilgrimage sites Entrance to Chandranath Temple Sitakunda is a major site for pilgrimage in Bangladesh, as it features 280 mosques (including the Shah Mosque) 8 mazars (including Baro Awlias Mazar, Kalu Shah Mazar, Fakir Hat Mazar, Shahjahani Shah Mazar), 49 Hindu temples (including Labanakhya Mandir, Chandranath Mandir, Shambunath Mandir), 3 ashrams (including Sitakunda Shankar Math), and 3 Buddhist temples. The Hammadyar Mosque, located at the village of Masjidda on the banks of a tankTank is a term that was used in colonial times for a man-made body of water or reservoir (dighi). known as the Hammadyar Dighi, was built during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah, the last Husain Shahi sultan of Bengal, as recorded by the inscription above the central entrance. The Sudarshan Vihara at village Mayani here, as well as the Vidarshanaram Vihara at village Mayani in Patiya were both established in 1922 by Prajnalok Mahasthavir (1879–1971), an eminent Bangladeshi Buddhist preacher. According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated herself in the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body on his shoulders. Knowing that the dance of destruction was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple on top of the peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh. According to Rajmala, the temple of Chandranath received considerable endowments from the Twipra Kingdom in the time of king Dhanya Manikya, who once attempted to remove the lingam from the temple to his kingdom. Poets from across the ages – from Jayadeva (circa 1200 AD) to Nabinchandra Sen (1847–1909) – were said to be devoted to the temple. Chandranath is within the jurisdiction of Gobardhan Math, which was founded, according to legends, by Padmacharya, a disciple of Shankaracharya and founder of Vana and Aranya sects of the Dashanami Sampradaya. An International Vedic Conference was held from 15 to 17 February 2007 at Sitakunda Shrine (Tirtha) Estate in Sitakunda Chandranath Dham, on the occasion of the great Shiva Chaturdarshi (a Hindu festival in worship of Lord Shiva). These temples have been subject to repeated attack and violation by Muslims, and Bangladesh Hindu Bouddha Christian Oikya Parishad has asked for the pilgrims to be protected. Flora and fauna Kans grass (Saccharum spontaneum) in Sitakunda Sitakunda eco-park While returning to Kolkata after completing a floral survey, Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817–1911) carried out the first survey of Sitakunda's local flora, as recorded in his Himalayan Journals, in January 1851 (published by the Calcutta Trigonometrical Survey Office and Minerva Library of Famous Books; Ward, Lock, Bowden & Co., 1891). The forests of the region are known to be evergreen type with a preponderance of deciduous species with a levelled distribution. The topmost level consists of Garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), Telsur (Hopea odorata), Chapalish (Artocarpus chaplasha), Chundul (Tetrameles nudiflora) and Koroi or the Moluccan albizia (Falcataria moluccana). The lower level consists of species of Jarul (Lagerstroemia speciosa), Toon (Toona ciliata), Jam (Syzygium cumini), Jalpai (Elaeocarpus robustus) and Glochidion. Lianas, epiphytes (mostly of orchids, asclepiads, ferns and leafy mosses) and herbaceous undergrowths are abundant. Savannah formations are found in the open, along the banks of rivers and swamps with common tall grasses like Kans (Saccharum spontaneum), Shon (Imperata cylindrica and I. arundincca) and Bena (Vetiveria zizanoides). Several species of Bamboo are cultivated that are common in Bangladesh including Bambusa balcooa (which is also common in Assam), B. vulgaris, B. longispiculata, B. tulda and B. nutans; the latter two also being common in the hills of the region. A number of fish species have become endangered in the area due to overfishing. They include Bhoal (Raiamas bola), Lakkhya (Eleutheronema tetradactylum), Chapila (Gudusia chapra), Datina (Acanthopagrus latus), Rupchanda (Pampus argenteus), Pungash (Pangasius pangasius), Chhuri (Trichiurus lepturus), Ilsha Chandana (Tenualosa toli), Hilsha (Tenualosa ilisha), Faishya (Anchoviella commersonii), Maittya (Scomberomorus commerson), Gnhora (Labeo gonius), Kata (Nemapteryx nenga), Chewa (Taenioides cirratus), Sundari bele (Glossogobius giuris), Bnata (Liza parsia), Koral (Etroplus suratensis) and Kawoon (Anabas testudineus), as well as crustaceans like tiger shrimps.For name alternatives see (list) The first eco-park in Bangladesh, Sitakunda Botanical Garden and Eco Park, was established in 2001 along with a botanical garden, under a five-year (2000–2004) development project at a cost of on of the Chandranath Hills in Sitakunda. The eco-park was established to facilitate biodiversity conservation, natural regeneration, new plantations and infrastructure development, as well as to promote nature-based tourism to generate income. The park, , and the garden, , under the Bariadhala Range of Chittagong Forest Division, are rich with natural Gymnosperm tree species including Podocarpus neriifolius and species of Gnetum and Cycas. The park is reported to be able to receive 25,000 visitors in a single weekend. With the botanical garden included, the number of visitors can reach up to 50,000. According to the International Journal of Biodiversity Science and Management, however, \\"ignoring the dependence of local people on park resources created conflicts between local communities and the park authority\\" and \\"prohibition on the extraction of forest products from the park... make the livelihoods of surrounding villagers vulnerable\\". Society Faujdarhat Cadet College The educational institutions of the upazila include Faujdarhat Cadet College (founded in 1958), 4 regular colleges (including Sitakunda Degree College founded in 1968), 24 high schools (including Sitakund Government Model High School founded in 1913 and Madam Bibir Hat Shahjania High School founded in 1905), 10 madrasas, and 76 junior and primary schools. All the secondary schools and regular colleges are under the Chittagong Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education split from the Comilla Board in May 1995. Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah (1885–1969), an eminent Bangladeshi linguist, served as the headmaster of the Government High School from 1914 to 1915. On 24 July 1996, members of Bangladesh Chhatra League and Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS) in Sitakunda Degree College fought with guns and firecrackers over a minor dispute. On 29 July 1996, two ICS members of the college were abducted and one of them was killed. Faujdarhat Cadet College and Bangladesh Military Academy are also situated in this upazila. , average literacy of Sitakunda Upazila for people of 7 years of age or more is 54.6%, while the average literacy of Sitakunda Pourashabha is 53.9%. There has been an overall growth of 32.9% between 1991 and 2001, which for men was 20.5% and for women 59.2%. 70,315 people of the Upazila between the ages of 5 and 24 years attend schools, an overall increase of 35.6% between 1991 and 2001, which for men was 28.1% and for women 45.4%. The highest school attendance rate is observed in age group 10–14 years. The health service centers in the upazila include a health complex, an infectious diseases hospital, a railway TB hospital, 11 family planning centres and a veterinary treatment centre. Bangladesh Railway set up the hospital at Kumira in 1952 with a capacity of 150 beds. The capacity was reduced to 50 beds in 1994 as some focus was redirected to the Railway Hospital at Central Railway Building in Chittagong. Originally built to treat railway employees, the hospital now also treats people from the wider community. Malaria, dengue and other fevers, hepatitis, as well as respiratory infections including tuberculosis are some of the major health threats. The percentage of disabled in Sitakunda is reported to be the highest in Bangladesh, at 17% compared to the national average of 13%. Banshbaria Union has been declared as 100% sanitized, as all households in the union adopted sanitary latrines, while the upazila has only 16% sanitation coverage. A survey published in 2006 by the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project found that of the 18,843 tube wells surveyed, 24.7% were found to be contaminated. Visible signs of arsenic poisoning were found in 47 people. National newspapers published in Dhaka including Prothom Alo, Ajker Kagoj, Janakantha and The Daily Ittefaq are available in Sitakunda, as well as regional newspapers published in Chittagong Azadi and Purbakon. It also has its own local newspapers and a journalist community. In 2003, Atahar Siddik Khasru, the president of the local Press Club, went missing on 30 April and was rescued on 21 May. He was abducted and tortured by unidentified men allegedly on charges of protesting against the harassment of Mahmudul Haq, editor of local magazine Upanagar. On 6 May, about 30 local journalists working for national and local press took to the streets in protest. The other weekly newspaper is Chaloman Sitakunda. Television channels available in the upazila include satellite television channels like Channel i, ATN Bangla, Channel One, NTV, as well as terrestrial television channel Bangladesh Television. The festivals of Shiva Chaturdashi in middle of the month of Falgun (end of February) and Chaitra Sankranti at end of the month of Chaitra (mid April) are observed with much fanfare, featuring the largest Hindu fair of the district. The Sitakunda Upazila Krira Sangstha (Sports Club) is noted for its participation in soccer. There are 151 clubs, a public library and two cinema halls in the upazila.

Heiðmörk was proclaimed a municipal conservation area of Reykjavík in 1950. It is located southeast of Elliðavatn, Iceland, and is about from the city of Reykjavík. Its name is derived from its namesake in Norway, Hedmark (; both derive from the Old Norse '), an area with deep forests. The total area of the conservation area is . It is a popular recreational area in Iceland. Heiðmörk is where Reykjavík's water reservoirs and drinking water wells are located. Rauðhólar are a notable natural formation of Heiðmörk, a cluster of red coloured pseudocraters. Flora More than 4 million trees have been planted since 1950 and the existing vegetation has thrived since the area has been fenced off. The most prominent of the 26 species of trees at Heiðmörk is the Sitka Spruce and at least 150 wild flower species have been counted. Fauna More than 60 species of wild birds have been counted, especially around Elliðavatn and Myllulækjartjörn. Recreational area Tree planting in Heidmork began in the summer of 1949 in so-called Teygingar on the heathland above the old farm of Elliðavatn (Elliðavatnsheiði). There were planted 8.000 plants of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), 500 of Norway spruce (Picea abies), and 500 of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) which now forms a part of the woodland in Heiðmörk now known as Undanfari. Scots pine is scattered near Undanfara and on Elliðavatnsheiði, and probably some can be traced back to the first planting in Heiðmörk. It is worth mentioning that the spring of 1949 was one of the coldest during the 20th century. The forest in Heiðmörk now covers 820 ha of Conifer and 650 ha of Birch in gross profit. Reykjavík Forestry Associationheidmork.is has supervised and managed the afforestation in Heiðmörk from the starting point. Reykjavík Municipal Work School has done an invaluable work on the premises and the teenagers continue their work in the summer. Since Heiðmörk was opened “pioneers” have worked in Heiðmörk. At first 50 strips of land were allotted to these groups of pioneers (often comprising societies of individuals), and each allotment was on the scale of 1-5 ha. Now there are approximately 140 “pioneer plots” altogether. The plots have been allotted to associations and groups within this field of interest for planting and outdoor recreational area. The associations are supplied with tree seedlings, equipment, fertilizer, and guidance as needed by Reykjavík Forestry Association in return for planting and keeping the area clean. Proprietary right does not comply with the plots, but it is marked the party in question. In latter years there are increasingly more groups which are making footpaths, thinning, and installing benches and alike, each at their own patch. In the recent years there have been 20 – 30 groups taking an active part in the planting process, and every year the number of groups increases by 2 – 4 new ones. The function of Reykjavík Forestry Association as a guardian and the prime executive power in Heiðmörk has naturally undergone considerable changes. At first the activities was mainly about conservation, planting and rehabilitation of severe damaged ecosystems, and in addition improvement of accessibility was made through road and path constructions. In latter years the activity partakes in managing this frequently-visited outdoor-forest in the country. It entails emphasis on development and management of important infrastructure, such as paths, rest stops, and educational and information signs as well as tending forest. In recent years the emphasis has been on thinning pieces of forest with the aim of improving the quality of the forest for outdoor life, and in addition gaining by-products made of wood. New forest planting is now primarily done in areas with lupine-fields, whereas before it was mainly on heathland. Reykjavík Forestry Association and Reykjavík School of Nature operate a solid and reliable education program which is held mainly in the shelter of the forest. Furthermore, an education room has been set up in the old house of stone at Elliðavatn, the birthplace of the poet Einar Benediktsson. In the beginning the conservation area was confined to the lava field Hólmshraun, Elliðavatnsheiði, and a part of Vatnsenda estate, and the area was then 1.350 ha. A contract with public hospitals in 1957 for 950 hectares strip of land in the estate of Vífilstaðir, Heiðmörk was extended to 2.300 ha. Finally in 1964 Reykjavík city council consigned the landholding of Elliðavatn to Reykjavík Forestry Association for conservation, and Heiðmörk progressed to about 3.000 ha. The Association’s contract of management with the City of Reykjavík and Reykjavík Energy which was made in the beginning of 2013 Heiðmörk was enlarged to Suðurlandsvegur (the main road between Reykjavík and South Iceland), into 3.200 ha. Rauðhólar was within the Heiðmörk fence and became a conservation area as natural monument in 1961, and a public field in 1974. Heiðmörk is the principal outdoor recreational area in the capital and district. Its attraction grows in accordance with enriched vegetation, and every year the number of visiting guests increases.

Robert Taylor USNR. Plot The plot of the film revolves around the life of seamen on board an anonymous aircraft carrier. Because of war time restrictions, the name of the aircraft carrier was disguised as \\"the Fighting Lady\\", although she was later identified as . (\\"Fighting Lady\\" was the known moniker of the Yorktown, just as \\"Lady Lex\\" was for Lexington, \\"The Big E\\" for Enterprise, etc...) A few shots of aircraft landing were filmed aboard the Yorktown's sister ship . Frequently mentioned is the adage that war is 99% waiting. The first half or so of the film is taken up with examining the mundane details of life on board the aircraft carrier as she sails through the Panama Canal and into the Pacific Ocean, finally seeing action at Marcus Island (attacked in 1943). The film provides aerial views of a series of airstrikes at Japanese bases in the Pacific theatre. Following an attack on Kwajalein in early 1944, intelligence reports that an armada of Japanese ships is massing near Truk, a major Japanese logistical base in the Carolines. The Fighting Lady and some of her task force are sent on a \\"hit and run\\" mission to neutralize it and return to Marcus, but not to attempt a landing. Once the ship returns from the massive, two-day Truk raid, it is then sent to the waters off the Marianas and participates in the famous \\"Marianas Turkey Shoot\\". At the very end some of the servicemen who appeared in the film are reintroduced to us, and the narrator informs us that they have died in battle. Production The film uses Technicolor footage shot by \\"gun cameras\\" mounted directly on aircraft guns during combat. This gives a very realistic edge to the film, while the chronological following of the ship and crew mirror the experiences of the seamen who went from green recruits through the rigours of military life, battle, and, for some, death. In his autobiography Baa Baa Black Sheep, U.S. Marine Corps ace pilot Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington claims that the film briefly shows the small pit in which he and five other prisoners of war took cover during the Truk raid. Boyington had been captured by the Japanese and was being transported to a prison camp on the Truk islands when the raid began. Boyington writes that the prisoners, tied and blindfolded, were thrown from their transport plane during a hurried landing, and that one of their Japanese captors saved their lives by throwing them into the pit, where they survived without harm. According to Boyington, the film also shows a crater from a two-thousand pound bomb that landed just fifteen feet from the pit. Due to her fighting heritage, and to honor all carrier sailors and airmen, the Yorktown is on permanent display at Patriots Point in Charleston, SC. Alfred Newman's musical theme originally appeared in Vigil in the Night and was reused in 'Hell and High Water and in many 20th Century Fox film trailers. Reception and Legacy The Fighting Lady won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 17th Academy Awards. The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2018.

Unlike previous platforms, Coco is built along more ape-like lines, rather than human. Coco is also notable for being mobile. Although there is ongoing research on the robot, the group has many robots dealing with human interactions. The Humanoid Robotics Group has planned to add more useful functions in the future, but have not set an exact date for such project.  Humanoid Robotics Group Mission  The mission of the Humanoid Robotics Group is to create a robot that can interact with humans and objects without being dependent on a caretaker. Coco should be able to investigate environments and be able to discover important outlooks of the world. Using multiple sensors, Coco should be conducive to human interaction. Interactions with humans include: *reacting to others' emotions *showing empathy *non-aggressive social behavior *independent  Physical  All the following dimensions of Coco are in millimeters: *length of the head is 165 *width of the head is 140 *from left shoulder Y-axis to right shoulder Y-axis is 252 *from shoulder Y-axis to shoulder X-axis is 58 *from hip to hip is 269 *from hip to shoulder 292 *forearm is 156 *upper arm is 154 *upper leg is 65 *lower leg is 45 Coco's appearance is ape-like, which coincides with early evolutionary behaviors. It has broad shoulders, short legs, and long arms made of carbon fiber. The robot's color is all black except for the head which is clear and has two colored eyes with cameras that indicate objects near it. The cords connecting the back of the head to the body are used for transmitting codes for movements and reactions. Coco is a fifteen DOF (degrees of freedom) quadruped with gorilla-like proportions. DOF is the number of independent conditions that define Coco's arrangement. The DOF are located all throughout the robot. There are two DOF per hind leg, one on the hip, another at the knee, three in each front limb, two on the shoulder, and one on the elbow. The head has an additional five DOF for the movement of the object. Coco can change postures and its vestibular system allows it to have its eye ground level to see objects in a small radius. It has a high speed serial cable that links the robot to the main controller. The controlling method is called torque-position control, which is the force applied to a lever in a rotation. The method most similar to the torque control is the Series Elastic Actuators, \\"springs that are intentionally placed in series between the motor and actuator output to have a constant force\\" but that method powers the elastic element. Most of the above methods are useful but the least useful is the elastic element. Uses As of right now, Coco is controlled through many sensors to walk and be aware of the objects in its perimeter. For future uses, Coco will be able to be aware of others emotions and produce a reaction. Coco will also be able to help different types of learning and interact with humans or objects that need its help. Future Work The aim for the Humanoid Robotics Group is for Coco to have many human-like experiences through common sense, emotions, and visuals. The Humanoid Robotics Group would still like to contribute more work to Coco such as: providing the robot with high level functions to develop interactive behaviors, providing aid for some types of learning, providing an improvement in the force control, and providing hand-eye coordination. Some time in the near future Coco should be able to be aware of its own body, have flexible limb dynamics, and be able to interact with human without it being controlled.

He was also involved in the production of CBWT's Eye-To-Eye program and was for a time executive producer and co-host of W5 on CTV. In 1976, Troyer provided commentaries following episodes of The Prisoner as they were broadcast on commercial-free TVOntario. He also interviewed Patrick McGoohan about the series for a TVOntario broadcast in 1977 and was credited as a consultant in the 1976 TVOntario publication The Prisoner Puzzle. No Safe Place (), published in 1977, was a book by Troyer about mercury poisoning in Northern Ontario waters. His 1980 book 200 Days: Joe Clark in Power () was an examination of the short-lived Progressive Conservative administration of Prime Minister Joe Clark, which was a 1979 minority government, defeated in a motion of non-confidence late that year. He also wrote a book on the history of Canadian radio and television broadcasting, The Sound & the Fury: An Anecdotal History of Canadian Broadcasting (), published in 1982. Troyer married his first wife, Margaret and had six children: Marc, Scott, Jill, Jennifer, Peggy and John. He also had two children, Peter and Anne, with his second wife. In the early 1980s, Troyer and his third wife, Glenys Moss, established a journalism school in Sri Lanka. In his later years he focused on environmental issues. Troyer was listed as a consultant for The Canadian Green Consumer Guide (), published in 1989, and wrote Preserving Our World: A Consumer's Guide to the Brundtland Report (), published in 1990. Troyer contracted throat cancer and died in Toronto at age 59.

A confidence-and-supply agreement is one whereby a party or independent members of parliament will support the government in motions of confidence and appropriation or budget (supply) votes, by either voting in favour or abstaining. However, parties and independent members normally retain the right to otherwise vote in favour of their own policies or on conscience on legislative bills.James Cook, Governments, coalitions and border politics, BBC News, 7 May 2010Why the PM is safe in No 10 for the moment, The Independent, 8 May 2010https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/IfG%20Insight%20Confidence%20and%20Supply%20final.pdf A coalition government is a more formal arrangement than a confidence-and- supply agreement, in that members from junior parties (i.e., parties other than the largest) gain positions in the cabinet, ministerial roles and may be expected to hold the government whip on passing legislation. Confidence In most parliamentary democracies, members of a parliament can propose a motion of confidenceOtherwise, when it is proposed by the Government itself upon a piece of legislation, \\"the Chambers are enslaved in the exercise of their principal function just because it was thought that their being master of the fiduciary relationship were to be reaffirmed on each bill\\": or of no confidence in the government or executive. The results of such motions show how much support the government currently has in parliament. Should a motion of confidence fail, or a motion of no confidence pass, the government will usually either resign and allow other politicians to form a new government, or call an election. Supply Most parliamentary democracies require an annual state budget, an appropriation bill, or occasional financial measures to be passed by parliament in order for a government to pay its way and enact its policies. The failure of a supply bill is in effect the same as the failure of a confidence motion. In early modern England, the withholding of funds was one of Parliament's few ways of controlling the monarch. Examples of confidence- and-supply deals =Australia= The Australian Labor Party Gillard Government formed a minority government in the hung parliament elected at the 2010 federal election resulting from a confidence-and-supply agreement with three independent MPs and one Green MP. =Canada= British Columbia After the 2017 British Columbia provincial election, the Green Party of British Columbia agreed to a confidence-and-supply agreement in support of the British Columbia New Democratic Party. The incumbent British Columbia Liberal Party briefly tried to form a government, but was immediately defeated in a confidence vote by the NDP and Greens. New Brunswick On 2 November 2018 (less than two months after the 2018 New Brunswick general election) the legislative assembly voted 25-23 for a motion, introduced by the Progressive Conservatives, to amend the throne speech to declare no confidence in the government. Subsequently, Premier Brian Gallant indicated his intention to resign the premiership and recommend to the lieutenant governor that PC leader Blaine Higgs be given the mandate to form a minority government: \\"I will go see the lieutenant governor at her earliest convenience to inform her that I will be resigning as premier, and I will humbly suggest to her honour to allow the leader of the Conservative Party to attempt to form a government and attempt to gain the confidence of the house.\\" People's Alliance leader Kris Austin said he would work with the new government \\"in the areas we agree on,\\" and reiterated his promise to support the Progressive Conservatives on confidence votes for a period of 18 months. Green Party leader David Coon said he would start working with the Tories in an attempt to ensure his party's issues were on the government's agenda. Ontario Twenty-two days after the 1985 Ontario provincial election, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario government resigned after a vote of no confidence, and the Ontario Liberal Party formed a government with the support of the Ontario New Democratic Party. The agreement between the two parties was referred to as \\"The Accord\\". =India= Third Front national governments were formed in 1989 and 1996 with outside support of one of the two major parties, BJP or Congress. The CPI-M gave outside support to the Congress Party from 2004–2008, but later withdrew support after the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement. =Ireland= After the 2016 general election, a minority government was formed by Fine Gael and some independents, with confidence-and- supply () support from Fianna Fáil in return for a published set of policy commitments from the government. Fianna Fáil abstains on confidence and supply votes, but reserves the right to vote for or against any bill proposed in the Dáil or Seanad. The deal was to last until the end of 2018, with the possibility of renewal before then to extend it to the five-year maximum term of a Dáil. On 12 December 2018, Fianna Fáil Leader Micheál Martin said his party will guarantee the Government can continue throughout 2019 and an election may be held early in 2020. The 2020 Irish general election was held on Saturday 8 February 2020. The election was called following the dissolution of the 32nd Dáil by the President, at the request of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on 14 January 2020. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, confidence and supply arrangements are common due to the MMP system used in the country. The parties providing confidence and supply have a more prominent role than in other countries, with MPs from the support parties often being appointed to ministerial portfolios outside of Cabinet. New Zealand codified the procedures it used to form these Governments in its Cabinet Manual. John Key's National Party administration formed a minority government in 2008 thanks to a confidence-and-supply agreement with the ACT, United Future and the Māori Party. A similar arrangement in 2005 had led to Helen Clark's Labour Party forming a coalition government with the Progressive Party, with support on confidence and supply from New Zealand First and United Future. After the 2014 election, National re-entered confidence-and-supply agreements with United Future, the ACT Party, and the Māori Party. In 2017, despite National winning more votes than Labour in the election, New Zealand First chose to enter coalition with Labour to help them change the government, with support on confidence and supply from the left-wing Green Party. =United Kingdom= Between 1977 and 1978, Jim Callaghan's Labour Party stayed in power thanks to a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Liberal Party, in a deal which became known as the Lib-Lab Pact. In return, the Labour Party agreed to modest policy concessions for the Liberal Party. In the aftermath of the 2017 general election which left Theresa May's Conservative Party without a majority, a confidence-and-supply agreement was agreed with the Democratic Unionist Party. Devolved government Confidence and supply deals are more frequent in the devolved legislatures of Scotland and Wales due to the use of proportional representation. The Scottish National Party and Scottish Green Party have a confidence and supply deal in the Scottish Parliament. The Welsh Labour Party and Plaid Cymru had a similar co-operation deal in the Welsh Assembly until October 2017.

Weller founded Weller Pottery in Fultonham, Ohio, United States. Originally, his business consisted of a small cabin and one beehive kiln, and Weller produced flower pots, bowls, crocks, and vases. By 1905, Weller Pottery was the largest pottery in the country. It mass-produced art pottery until about 1920, and it produced commercial lines until the pottery closed in 1948. Early period, 1872−1910 In 1872, when Samuel Augustus Weller (1851−1925) was 21, he established and operated a one-man pottery in Fultonham in Muskingum County, Ohio. Between 1882−1890, he had expanded to Zanesville, with a factory on Pierce Street along the river. In 1893 he saw William Long's Lonhuda ware at the Chicago World's Fair, and Long joined Weller to produce this faience-glazed pottery line. When Long left Weller's employ after less than a year, Weller renamed the faience line Louwelsa after his daughter Louisa, who had been born in 1896. Weller Pottery building at the 1904 World's Fair Vase, Weller Pottery, Zanesville, Ohio, c. 1905, glazed earthenware From 1895−1904, Charles Babcock Upjohn was Weller's head designer, developing the DickenswareI, DickenswareII, Eocean and Corleone lines. By 1897, Henry Schmidt designed Weller's Turada line, the first \\"squeeze-bag\\" pottery line in the Ohio valley. Decorators used squeeze-bags like cake decorators, squeezing the paint onto the ceramic rather than painting it on with brushes. From 1902−1907, Jacques Sicard and Henri Gellie worked at Weller's pottery to develop a metallic glaze, which had been introduced by Clement Massier in France by 1889, as Reflets Metalliques. The Sicardo line went into production in the fall of 1903, but the process was difficult, and only about 30% of the finished pots were marketable. In this same period, between 1902 and 1905, Weller had become the world's largest pottery and mass-producer of art pottery. In 1903 and 1904, Frederick Hurten Rhead worked for a short time at Weller Pottery, developing Jap Birdimal line in 1904. He left in 1904 to become Roseville Pottery's first art director, and later designed the very popular Fiesta line for Homer Laughlin China Company. At the St. Louis Exposition in 1904, Weller had huge display, including a vase, and a working studio, complete with a kiln. In 1908, Rudolph Lorber developed Dechiwo, which led to Burntwood, Claywood, and other similar lines. =Early Weller art ware lines= Portrait Plaque, 1902–07, \\"Molded red earthenware body modeled in low relief with a Pre-Raphaelitesque left profile of a woman ...

In 1917, Weller had introduced the family of Hudson lines. In this same period, Dorothy England Laughead created Silvertone, Chase, and the Garden Animals. John Lessell headed the decorating department from 1920−1924, developing luster−glaze lines including LaSa, Marengo, Cloudburst, Lamar, and others. On July 1, 1922, Weller Pottery incorporated as \\"S.A. Weller, Inc.\\" Samuel Augustus Weller died on October 4, 1925. His nephew Harry Weller became president from 1925−1932, introducing continuous kiln operation. He consolidated the Weller plants in 1931 due to depression era economics, and died in auto crash in 1932. From 1930−1932, the last freehand decorated lines introduced at Weller were Stellar, Geode, Cretone, Raceme, and Bonito. = Middle period art ware and commercial lines = Cameo Jewel 1910 Souevo 1910 Camelot 1913 Clinton Ivory−before 1914 Roma 1914−late 1920s Muskota 1915 Teakwood 1915 Athens 1915 Blue Drapery 1915 Brighton 1915 Copra 1915 Creamware 1915 Fairfield 1915 Orris 1915 Baldin 1915–1920 Flemish mid teens−1928 Forrest mid teens−1928 Jewell approx. 1916 Dupont late teens Rosemont late teens−late 1920s Zona 1920 Late period, 1932−1948 From 1932−1933, Sam Weller's son- in-law Frederic Grant was president for one year.

Family life Houlik is married for the third time, and has fathered four children. He has four grand children and four daughters. Education He first became a student of the tenor saxophone under the guidance of Harvey Egan during his early years at Islip High School. He studied music education at State University of New York at Fredonia and the University of Illinois. He studied with saxophonist Cecil Leeson at Ball State University. He studied saxophone with classical saxophone pioneer Sigurd Raschèr, and did additional study with Raschèr at the Eastman School of Music. The vast majority of classical saxophonists play alto saxophone almost exclusively. Houlik, however, gravitated to the tenor saxophone early in life, and was encouraged by Raschèr to pursue the instrument. Teaching career Houlik began teaching at East Carolina University where he built a successful saxophone program. He later became professor of Saxophone at the North Carolina School of the Arts. He was for twenty-two years Professor of Saxophone and Chair of Woodwinds at Duquesne University, and is now Artist Lecturer in Saxophone at Carnegie Mellon University, both in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has held many summer saxophone study programs, at North Carolina School of the Arts and more recently at Wildacres Retreat, a facility in Little Switzerland, North Carolina. At the Wildacres workshops he is joined by the members of the New Century Saxophone Quartet who coach saxophone quartets made up of workshop participants. Performing career Houlik began his performing career with a Washington, D.C. debut at the Phillips Collection. He has appeared in such major venues as Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Town Hall in Toronto, the Smithsonian Institution, and London's Barbican. His Carnegie Hall debut was in 1978 and he played Alice Tully Hall in 1981.Saxophone history timeline at Potsdam University web site He regularly appears on university campuses throughout the United States as a performer and as a teacher of clinics and master classes. His concerto performances have included those with the American Symphony Orchestra, the Grant Park Symphony, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Phoenix Symphony, the West Virginia Symphony, the San Remo Orchestra (Italy), the Istanbul Philharmonic, the North Carolina Symphony, the Chamber Orchestra of Milan, the New Art Philharmonic of Pretoria, South Africa, the Czech Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra, the United States Navy Band, and dozens more. The Washington Post hailed Houlik as “The Andrés Segovia of the Tenor Saxophone.” His debut with the London Symphony Orchestra moved the London Daily Mail to describe him as “the world’s great saxophone virtuoso.” In 1995, Houlik performed for President Clinton in the East Room of the White House at the National Arts Award Ceremony. He is an artist/clinician for the Yamaha Corporation and D'Addario Reserve reeds. Saxophone works composed for Houlik Following the example of Sigurd Raschèr, Houlik has worked closely with many composers to foster the development of a repertoire for the tenor saxophone, an instrument with few concertos in its repertoire. Over one hundred pieces of music have been composed for, or commissioned by, Houlik. These include: *Walter S. Hartley, \\"Poem\\", 1967 *Walter S.

Born in Signa, near Florence, between 1165 and 1175, he was a professor of rhetoric (ars dictaminis) at the University of Bologna and then the University of Padua. In the early thirteenth century, he was one of the first Western European authors to write in the vernacular, in his case Italian. He spent his career travelling between Ancona, Venice, and Bologna and died at Florence. He wrote a history of the 1173 Siege of Ancona, his only work of that kind, and works on chess. His love of elaborate practical jokes is described by Helen Waddell in The Wandering Scholars (1927). The events of the 1173 Siege of Ancona were narrated in 1204 in da Signa's ‘’Liber de Obsidione Anconae’’. This book especially made widely known the self-sacrifice of the widow Stamira, who had a major role in saving the city. Of this book, three copies remain: one is kept in the Vatican, the second in the National Library of Paris and the third remained unpublished until 1723, when it was bought by Father Auriberti of Brescia, from which the text was translated and published by the historian Ludovico Antonio Muratori in 1725.

She married Henry Lytton, who eventually became the company's longstanding principal comedian. Henri's career got off to an early start when she joined Florence St. John's Opera Company at the age of 15, but she left that troupe to help start her husband's acting career. Together, they struggled to establish more secure careers in the theatre and eventually obtained steady employment in D'Oyly Carte touring companies. Henri was promoted to play the leading mezzo-soprano roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and the other productions of the company for about a decade. However, in 1898, after her husband became a principal player in the main company at the Savoy Theatre, Henri retired from the stage at the age of 34. Life and career Henri was born Louisa Webber in Paddington, London, the daughter of William Webber, a cheese seller, and Eliza née Saville.Louie Henri profile at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 6 April 2009 Henri probably met her future husband, Henry Lytton, at St. Philip's Church, where he sang as a boy and she may also have sung.Jones, p. 16 =Early career= Henri first appeared on stage in 1879 at the age of 15 with Florence St. John's Opera Company, performing in Jacques Offenbach's Madame Favart at the Strand Theatre and Edmond Audran's Olivette at the Avenue Theatre, both in 1880, in the latter of which she played a small role. She appeared in other operettas with St. John but left in 1881 to help Lytton begin his acting career. They joined the company at Philharmonic Theatre, Islington in several plays, including The Obstinate Bretons and The Shaughraun by Dion Boucicault, and then, with Kate Santley, played at the Royalty Theatre. There they appeared in Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel by F. C. Burnand, but the theatre closed soon afterwards.Jones, p. 23 Henri rejoined St. John's company, playing in Bucalossi's Les Manteaux Noirs at the Avenue Theatre in 1882. She then rejoined Santley's company at the Royalty in 1883 in The Merry Duchess, but Lytton was out of acting work all this time and was forced to take a variety of odd jobs. Henri then played in the lavish 1883 Christmas pantomime of Cinderella at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.Jones, pp. 23–25 Henri and Lytton married in early 1884, both aged 19, at St. Mary Abbot's Church, Kensington. Neither family attended the ceremony.Jones, pp. 30–31 Henri left the Drury Lane to join the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to play the small role of Ada in the first provincial tour of Gilbert and Sullivan's Princess Ida, beginning in February 1884,Stone, David. Henry Lytton biography at the Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company website, accessed 11 May 2008 in which Courtice Pounds played Hilarion and Fred Billington played Hildebrand.Jones, pp. 13 and 32 She obtained an audition for Lytton, claiming that he was her brother, and he was also engaged in the chorus and small parts, and immediately as the understudy for the role of King Gama in Princess Ida.Lytton (Secrets), chapter 1, accessed 8 May 2008 The Ida tour continued for almost a year, and then the couple toured in additional D'Oyly Carte productions, interspersed with other engagements until May 1885. Also, in January 1885, Henri gave birth to the couple's first child, Ida Louise Jones, taking off only a few weeks before returning to the stage.Jones, p. 72 In the summer of 1885, she and Lytton joined with other out-of-work actors and travelled from town to town in Surrey for three months, performing a drama called All of Her, a comedy entitled Masters and Servants, and an operetta, Tom Tug the Waterman. The plays were augmented by songs and dances. The income provided by this work was not adequate, and the struggling young actors experienced hunger.Lytton (Secrets), chapter 2, accessed 8 May 2008 In the autumn of 1885, Henri and Lytton joined a D'Oyly Carte tour, playing in Trial by Jury (with Henri as the First Bridesmaid), The Sorcerer, Patience and The Pirates of Penzance. The two then played in the Christmas pantomime of Cinderella at the Theatre Royal, Manchester.Jones, p. 41 In 1886, they joined the chorus of Erminie, starring Florence St. John, and The Lily of Leoville by Ivan Caryll and Clement Scott, at the Comedy Theatre, and then toured in Erminie into the autumn of that year. Whenever out of work, Lytton took more odd jobs, putting his artist training to use part of the time by painting decorative plaques.Jones, p. 42 At the end of the year, Lytton was engaged in the chorus of The Mikado, which was nearing the end of its original run at the Savoy Theatre. Not only did Henri help Lytton get started in the theatre world and nurture his career, but Lytton was nearly musically illiterate, and Henri played the piano for him to prepare him for his roles, as well as coaching him in acting.Profile of Lytton at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 11 May 2008 Lytton became understudy to George Grossmith at the Savoy Theatre in January 1887 for the original production of Ruddigore, and when Grossmith fell ill, he had a chance to play the central character, Robin Oakapple. This led to an engagement for Lytton to play the principal comedian roles with D'Oyly Carte touring companies, beginning in 1887. In 1888, Henri joined him on tour, when she first played Edith in The Pirates of Penzance, Pitti-Sing in The Mikado, and substituted in April as Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore. By November 1888, however, Louie went on maternity leave.Profile of Henri at the Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 12 May 2008 =Principal soubrette and later years= In early 1889, Henri returned to the tour as Phoebe in The Yeomen of the Guard and also played Pitti-Sing. She left the company to have another baby in March 1890, returning in November to play Pitti-Sing. In 1891, Henri shared the roles of Pitti-Sing and Tessa in The Gondoliers and then added the title role in Iolanthe to her repertoire. In 1892–93, she had another childJones, p. 74 and then toured as Iolanthe, Pitti-Sing and Tessa, as well as Nelly Bly in The Vicar of Bray, Arabella Lane in Billee Taylor and Dorcas in Haddon Hall. In 1894–95, she played Princess Nekaya in Utopia, Limited, Nelly Bly, Zerbinetta in Mirette, Dolly Grigg in The Chieftain, and Melissa in Princess Ida. In 1896–97, Henri toured as Julia Jellicoe in The Grand Duke (together with Lytton as Ludwig),\\"Theatre Royal – The Grand Duke\\", The Manchester Guardian, 16 June 1896 as well as Nekaya; Constance in The Sorcerer; Cousin Hebe in Pinafore; Edith; Lady Angela in Patience; Iolanthe; Melissa; Pitti-Sing; Phoebe; and Tessa. In June 1897, she was called to the Savoy Theatre, joining Lytton there, where she was a chorister in the revival of Yeomen and the new production of The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein, while creating the title role in Old Sarah, the companion piece to both works. In March 1898, she played Tessa at the Savoy in the first revival of The Gondoliers. Henri left D'Oyly Carte and retired from the stage in May 1898, although she later appeared in a few silent films. Lytton claimed, in his 1922 memoir, The Secrets of a Savoyard, that she also appeared at some point in her career as the Plaintiff in Trial by Jury and Mrs. Partlett in The Sorcerer, which he says was \\"probably... a greater number of parts... than any other lady connected with the company.\\"Lytton, Henry. Secrets of a Savoyard, chapter 6, accessed 12 May 2008 Lytton died in 1935, and Henri survived him by a dozen years. Henri died in Surbiton, Surrey at the age of 83, survived by her son Henry Lytton, Jr., whose high profile marriage to Jessie Matthews in 1925 ended in divorce in 1930. The couple also had two other sons, one of whom was a pilot killed in World War I, and a daughter, Ena Elverston. They also had two other children who died in infancy. Recordings and films In 1902–03 Henri recorded several songs, mostly from Edwardian musical comedies, including A Country Girl and The Girl from Kays, and mostly duets with her husband. They also recorded a duet from Iolanthe, \\"None shall part us\\", although she had never appeared as Phyllis. Years later, Henri appeared in several silent films, perhaps the best known of which was the 1913 film Sixty Years a Queen, in which she played Queen Victoria.

On the evening of April 13, 2002, Catron was assassinated by Danny Shelley after he finished a campaign speech at a fish fry and political rally being held at the Shopville-Stab, Kentucky Volunteer Fire Department in the small community of Stab, Kentucky. Sheriff Catron was running for a fifth term as sheriff. His former deputy, Jeff Morris, who was campaigning against him, and Kenneth White, a well-known drug dealer, conspired to commit the murder. He is buried at Somerset Cemetery in Somerset, Kentucky, along with other relatives. A memorial for Sam Catron can be viewed by the public directly across from the fire department, where Catron fell beside his police cruiser. Biography Catron graduated from Somerset High School in 1971. His career in law enforcement began in the mid 1970s as a Pulaski County sheriff's deputy. Sam quit in 1981 after Johnny Adams was elected sheriff. In 1982, Catron became the chief of police for Ferguson, Kentucky, leaving the position in 1985 after being elected sheriff of Pulaski County. He held the office the rest of his days. During his tenure, Catron served on the Kentucky Governor's Task Force for Marijuana Eradication, the Pulaski County Rescue Squad, the Appalachian High Density Drug Traffic Area task force, was a member of the National Sheriffs' Association and was named Sheriff of the Year in 1989. Sheriff Catron was well known as an enemy of drug traffickers, flying a helicopter to search for marijuana plants and filling courtrooms with offenders his department had nabbed. In his private life, Catron served on the board of his local Boy Scout troop, was a Vigil life member and past chief of the Kawida Lodge Order of the Arrow, Boy Scouts of America. Assassination Pulaski County Sheriff Sam Catron was killed as a result of a plot concocted by Kenneth White and Jeff Morris. White and Morris influenced Danny Shelley, an OxyContin addict, to carry out their plot. White, who had recently been a DEA informant, led the gullible Shelley to believe that Catron was on the verge of arresting him. The plan called for Shelley to use Morris' motorcycle to escape after he shot Catron, and to meet with Morris and White later. However, Morris' real plan was to meet up with Shelley, kill him under a pretense of self-defense, and pin all of the blame for Catron's death on Shelley. Morris hoped this would make him a local hero and ensure his election as sheriff. After the election, White would then run the county with Morris as his puppet. The plot, which they had conceived earlier that day while at Wal-Mart in Somerset, backfired. Catron was campaigning at the Shopville Fire Department. As he opened the trunk of his vehicle, Shelley opened fire. Shelley stopped at the ridge line overlooking the Shopville Fire Department and was immediately spotted by law enforcement. During the ensuing pursuit, Shelley took a wrong turn and wrecked Morris' motorcycle. Shelley was found at the scene of the accident by local hero David Hoff, who subdued him until authorities arrived. After he was caught, he quickly implicated Morris, who, in turn, implicated White. All three were sent to prison. Kenneth White was a prisoner of Kentucky State Reformatory until his death in November, 2018.

The character first appeared in an issue of the National Lampoon humor magazine in the late 1970s (Vol. 2, No. 11, June, 1979, Page 28). A recorded version of the character also appeared on National Lampoon's White Album in 1979. Stern began using the character on The Howard Stern Show in the early 1980s. According to the trademark that Howard Stern filed for the character on October 16, 1992, he first used Fartman in July 1981, when Adam West was a guest on his show, to which he made an impromptu Fartman outfit in five minutes, although the original outfit contained a toilet seat necklace which Stern later discontinued from his motif.Stern, Howard Private Parts, 1993Howard Stern's Fartman Trademark USPTO.gov, October 16, 1992 Fartman generally attacks evil using his super powered flatulence, which also allows him to fly through the air. Feature film In the early 1990s, Stern considered producing a movie based on this successful and well- received character from the show. Stern first revealed his intentions to make a Fartman movie in 1992. On November 25, 1992, Variety reported that J. F. Lawton, writer of Pretty Woman and Under Siege, was planning to write and direct New Line Cinema's Stern's film project, titled The Adventures of Fartman. The film, which would be budgeted at $8 million-to-$11 million, was expected to go into production the following May in New York. David Permut would produce the film under his Permut Presentations Banner, which has a first-look deal at New Line. According to Lawton, The Adventures of Fartman would revolve around the superhero and his alter ego, a magazine publisher in the mold of Screw magazine's Al Goldstein.\\"Lawton directs Stern in wind- breaking film\\". Variety. November 25, 1992 On June 28, 1993, Time magazine reported that Lawton was working on a screenplay for The Adventures of Fartman. Lawton told Time, \\"There's a lot of nudity, some harsh language, a lesbian love scene, and the main character works for an underground sex magazine. We told New Line Cinema the plot, and they said, 'Yeah, it sounds great. But can't we make it PG-13?'\\"Corliss, Richard (June 28, 1993). \\"Hollywood's Summer: Just Kidding\\". Time. (Requires subscription) The Fartman movie was not put into production. Instead, Stern made a movie out of his bestselling book, Private Parts. Private Parts hit theaters on March 7, 1997, with the opening scene being a reenactment of Stern’s Fartman appearance at the 1992 MTV Music Awards. In 1999, Stern hoped to follow up the success of Private Parts with a movie about the Fartman character. Early in the year, Howard revealed he was in talks with studios to finally produce Fartman. He said that it would go into production in the summer of 1999, and that there were studios prepared to finance it.For The Week Of 2/15/99 to 2/19/99; marksfriggin.com, February 16, 1999 In December, Stern stated that the movie was on hold. Though he had a script, and two studios willing to produce it, he was unsure that it was the right time to do it.Howard's Separation, Penis Lamp And Fartman. 12/1/99. 6:10am www.marksfriggin.com, December 1, 1999 Stern also didn't want to make a PG-13 version of the film, the way the studios wanted it to be. In 2002, Stern considered shooting the Fartman movie on video for his fans, but to date no official productions have been greenlit. Fartman was considered by Vince McMahon to be brought in as a one time character for WrestleMania, but he and Howard Stern had different views on how to show him. Stern wanted to have his character knock out a wrestler with flatulence, but McMahon wanted Stern to get pummeled by a wrestler. Comics In November 1995, ReganBooks released Miss America, the second book by Stern, which includes a five-page comic book story featuring Fartman. It was written and drawn by Tom Morgan, based on Lawton's unproduced screenplay, and printed as a glossy paper insert.Stern, Howard (1995). Miss America, ReganBooks. Short film In April 2006, the Howard Stern Film Festival took place at the Hudson Theatre in New York City, NY. While announcing the competition, Stern encouraged fans to make short films about not only the show and its cast, but popular bits and characters such as Fartman.

Come Back. The film features Mischa Barton, Anton Yelchin, Charlie Creed-Miles, Helena Mattsson, Alexander Kaluzhsky, Bronson Pinchot and Shantel VanSanten. The film is about a teenage girl, Lana, who moves from a rural town in Russia to Moscow, completely unaware that meeting an internet girlfriend, Janie, will result in a string of adventures. Casting and filming began in May 2007, and it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008. The film was released in the United States on 31 January 2012. Despite the film not being released to mainstream film critics, You and I received mixed reviews from film critics.  Plot  Janie Sawyer, an American teenager, is forced to live in Moscow because of her father's job. Janie is trying to escape her lonely life in Moscow through her deep love of music and the internet. Janie and Lana Starkova meet on a fansite for the pop-band t.A.T.u. Trapped in a small Russian town, Lana wants desperately nothing more than to flee her mundane life causing the two girls to develop an instant connection through their love of t.A.T.u.'s music. The two girls adapt one of Lana's poems into a song and post it on the internet. t.A.T.u.'s manager hears the song being played by a corrupt music producer and he loves it. He later contacts the girls, instead of the producer, hoping they will allow t.A.T.u. to record the song without the producer. Janie and Lana's relationship then becomes the catalyst for a series of adventures through both the rock bottom and highlights of Moscow's society.

The group will not be playing Janie and Lana in the film, but will play themselves. Prior to its release, Lena Katina and Julia Volkova (t.A.T.u.) stated that they believed You and I to be \\"scandalous\\". The girls continued on to say that the film did not deal with the \\"love and roses\\" (over-sentimentality, \\"cheesiness\\") often found in romantic dramas, and instead, it focused on the real scandal and hardships that come along with relationships. Mitrofanov has mentioned that in selecting a director, they looked for one who knew the international market well, as they planned to release the film internationally. They turned to American production companies, and an English director, Roland Joffé, was chosen because of his Oscar-winning credentials. It was filmed in Moscow (stage nine of the Mosfilm building), Yaroslavl, and in Los Angeles, California; the story is based in Russia, mainly Moscow. Filming was scheduled to end on 14 August 2007 and editing began soon after. Mischa Barton was a no-show at the Cannes premiere of the film and didn't show up for promotion in London. The director, award-winning Roland Joffé, shockingly, told BBC Radio 1 host Natalie Jamieson: \\"She hasn't pulled out of interviews, she's pulled out of everything... Her room is here, she is here, but trying to get the two together has just been impossible.

In 2019, Barlow was appointed associate director of the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship (Maxwell Institute). Barlow was the first full-time professor of Mormon studies at a secular university as the inaugural Leonard J. Arrington Chair of Mormon History and Culture at Utah State University (USU), from 2007 to 2018. Biography Barlow was raised in Bountiful, Utah. He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1975, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in History from Weber State College. In 1980 and 1988, respectively, he received a master's degree in Theological Studies and Doctorate of Theology (Th.D.) from the Harvard Divinity School. While in the Boston area, Barlow taught at the LDS Church's local Institute of Religion. He also served as a counselor in a bishopric to Mitt Romney. Following the completion of his education, he served in consecutive years as a Mellon Post-doctoral Fellow at the University of Rochester. Prior to his arrival at USU, Barlow spent 17 years in the Department of Theological Studies at Hanover College in Indiana. In 2017, Barlow held the first fellowship at the Maxwell Institute at Brigham Young University. Scholarship Barlow's research interests have ranged over American religious and historical geography, concepts of “time” in secular and religious society, the problem of suffering and evil, and Mormon theology and practice. Barlow's first book, Mormons and the Bible: The Place of the Latter- day Saints in American Religion (Oxford, 1991, 1997) analyzed Latter-day Saint uses of the biblical text, including issues revolving around the LDS Church’s official backing of the King James translation. In 1992, the Mormon History Association (MHA) awarded the volume its Best First Book Award. His second book, the New Historical Atlas of Religion in America (co-authored with Edwin Scott Gaustad), examined the implications of religion’s connections with “place” and created hundreds of maps portraying the religious composition of the United States over time. The Association of American Publishers named the work the “Best Single-volume Reference Book in the Humanities” for 2001. The Arrington Chair of Mormon History and Culture The establishment in 2007 of the Arrington Chair at USU was one prominent symbol of a new era for the study of the Mormon faith in secular higher education. It was part of the new Religious Studies Program at the University, the first program in Utah enabling students to major in religion. Since the establishment of the Arrington Chair, Richard Bushman was inaugurated as the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University of Religion, which was followed by the 2012 creation of the Richard Lyman Bushman chair of Mormon Studies at University of Virginia. Additionally Utah Valley University has continued to offer its students a minor in Religious Studies, the University of Utah has recently followed suit, with both programs showing interest in Mormonism, and the University of Wyoming is working to gather funds for a professorship in Mormon studies. Academic service In 2006, Barlow was president of the MHA, and currently serves on the boards of directors for the Society for Mormon Philosophy and Theology and the Dialogue Foundation, on the Steering Committee for the American Academy of Religion’s new Consultation in Mormon Studies, and as a member of the editorial board of the Intermountain West Journal of Religious Studies.

He also was the author of Appalachia—The Land And Its People, a 20-page newspaper supplement published in 1992 by the Dayton Daily News for use in schools in the Dayton, Ohio, area. In 1996, Land of Yesterday, Osborne's autobiography about growing up in a mining community in West Virginia during the 1940s and 1950s, was adopted by Dayton Public Schools for use in its classrooms. In 2000, The Mountains Wept, an autobiographical novel, also was adopted by Dayton City Schools. His books are also being used in numerous other school systems throughout Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. Land of Yesterday and The Mountains Wept were both selected as commemorative items of Dayton's Bicentennial Celebration in 1996. Osborne's newsletter, Mountain Ink, has subscribers in 39 states. The newsletter serves as a link between Appalachians—those who now live in Appalachia and those who were forced to migrate to other parts of the country, especially during the 1950s and '60s. Ohio Magazine featured Osborne's writings in a 12-page article in its September 1997 issue. Osborne has been published in numerous local, regional and national periodicals throughout the country, and portions of The Mountains Wept were used in a Japanese television documentary. Osborne is a native of Wharton, West Virginia, a coal mine community located in the southern part of the state. Roger Osborne was born July 3, 1936, in Wharton, West Virginia. He died May 30, 2007, at 5:17 a.m. in Hospice of Dayton. He is buried in Byron Cemetery, Fairborn, Ohio.

If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command. It provides protection of life, property, and the preservation of peace and order when tasked to do so by state or federal authorities. The Wing also provides operational and support units, as well as qualified personnel, to support wartime tasking and contingency commitments of any nature. The 103d Attack Squadron is a descendant organization of the 103d Observation Squadron, formed on 27 June 1924. It was one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. Overview Currently the wing uses General Atomics MQ-9 Reapers to directly support combatant commanders across the globe providing; surveillance, reconnaissance gathering capabilities, combat search and rescue, and weapons employment when called upon. The wing hosts several new tenant organizations at Horsham ANGB including units of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve, among others. Units 111th Attack Wing's main units: *111th Attack Wing Staff *111th Operations Group :103rd Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper *111th Medical Group *111th Mission Support Group History =World War II= Martin B-26B Marauder Serial 42-95835 of the 391st Bomb Group. Martin B-26C Marauder Serial 42-107837 of the 575th Bomb Squadron. Constituted as 391st Bombardment Group (Medium) on 15 January 1943 and activated on 21 January Trained with B-26's for duty in Europe with Ninth Air Force. Assigned to RAF Matching, England on 26 January 1944. The group marking was a yellow triangle painted on the tail fin of their B-26s. The first mission was flown on 15 February and 150 more were completed before the group moved into France in late September 1944. During the ensuing weeks the 391st bombed targets such as airfields, marshalling yards, bridges, and V-weapon sites in France and the Low Countries to help prepare for the invasion of Normandy. The group attacked enemy defenses along the invasion beaches on 6 and 7 June 1944. From June through September, the group continued cross-Channel operations, which included attacks on fuel dumps and troop concentrations in support of Allied forces during the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July 1944, and strikes on transportation and communications to block the enemy's retreat to the east. A total of 20 B-26s were missing in action during the 391st's operations from Matching before the group moved onto the continent, transferring to Roye/Amy, France (ALG A-73) on 19 September 1944. The group then switched to Douglas A-26 Invaders and flew its last mission on 3 May 1945 from Asche, Belgium (ALG Y-29). The 391st Bomb Group returned to the United States in October and was inactivated at Camp Shanks, New York on 25 October 1945. =Pennsylvania Air National Guard= The wartime 391st Bombardment Group was re-activated and re- designated as the 111th Bombardment Group, and was allotted to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Philadelphia International Airport and was extended federal recognition on 20 December 1948 National Guard Bureau. The 111th Bombardment Group was bestowed the history, honors, and colors of the 391st Bombardment Group. The squadron was equipped with Douglas B-26B/C Invaders and was assigned to the PA ANG 53d Fighter Wing. Korean War Activation The 103d was federalized on 10 October 1950 along with its parent 111th Composite Wing due to the Korean War. Many of the pilots and maintenance personnel were split off and sent for duty overseas as individuals assigned to other combat units there. Eventually the B-26 bombers were sent as reinforcement aircraft to Far East Air Force for use in Korea. On 10 April 1951 the squadron and Wing were moved to Fairchild AFB, Washington and re-equipped with RB-29 Superfortress reconnaissance aircraft. Based on the World War II B-29 Bomber, the RB-29s were instead configured with multiple aerial cameras for mapping and reconnaissance missions. These RB-29s were used like the reconnaissance satellites of today, except they required actual over flight of the countries to be photographed. The 111th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (ANG) was composed of the 129th Bomb Squadron (formerly the 3d Bombardment Squadron), the 130th Bomb Squadron (formerly the 29th Bombardment Squadron) were joined by the 103d Bomb Squadron (Light) from the Pennsylvania ANG which was redesignated as the 103d Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (Medium). On 13 June 1952, two 111th pilots were flying an RB-29 over the Soviet Union when they were shot down by a pair of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s. The RB-29 was never recovered, having crashed in the waters off of Vladivostok, Russia. The Pennsylvanian families of the Air Guard pilots were told they had simply \\"vanished\\" in a weather-reconnaissance flight near Japan. It wasn't until the fall of the Soviet Union and the opening of communist archives that the relatives found out the truth in 1993. It is unknown as to whether any of the pilots or crew of this aircraft were captured by the Soviets at that time. When inactivated the ANG personnel were released to their parent units. The equipment and active duty personnel remained at Fairchild and were gained by the newly formed 99th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. Cold War Air Defense 103d FIS F-84F 51–1356, about 1955 F-94C 51-3562 about 1959 The 103d and the 111th were returned to control of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard in late November 1952, and the units were re- formed at Philadelphia International Airport by 1 January 1953. The 103d was re-equipped with the North American F-51D Mustang World War II fighter because of a lack of available jets at the time due to the Korean War. It was re- designated as the 103d Fighter Bomber Squadron and assumed an air defense mission. In 1955, Air Defense Command upgraded the group to the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak, and it received new aircraft. In July 1956, the 103d FIS switched to F-94A and B Starfigher interceptors; to F-94Cs in 1958 and the Northrop F-89H Scorpion in 1959. Airlift mission In 1962, the unit transitioned from the F-89J jet interceptor to a large, heavy transport, the Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter, a double-decked, four-engine airplane. The new mission moved the wing into the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), and its successor Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1966. In 1963, the 111th ended its 39-year history at Philadelphia airport and moved to brand new facilities on the north end of the Willow Grove Naval Air Station. From Willow Grove, the C-97 was used to transport troops and cargo all over the world. The unit's flying personnel were used heavily during the Vietnam War and over two hundred members earned Vietnam Service Medals for their flights into that war zone. Airborne Forward Air Control Cessna U-3A Blue Canoe about 1970 103d TASS A-37B in 1982 103d TASS OA-10A about 1992 In 1969, the unit changed mission yet again, returning to its original roots as an observation unit. The new 111th Tactical Air Support Group initially flew the U-3A Blue Canoe, a Cessna 310, as an intermediate aircraft until it received the aircraft it needed for Airborne Forward Air Control (AFAC): the Cessna O-2A Skymaster. The O-2 was a two propeller aircraft used early in the Vietnam War for coordination between ground forces and fighter aircraft (the \\"O\\" stands for observation). The Forward Air Control mission was sustained with the unit's switch to the OA-37 Dragonfly in 1981. The OA-37, was a heavier derivative of the T-37 trainer, and had been developed specifically for the Vietnam War. The unit made several deployments to Central America in the 1980s to fly with US allies there, who had been sold the A-37 as part of the US Foreign Military Sales program. The A-37s were retired in 1988, and the 111th received the A-10A Thunderbolt II ground support aircraft. It was also used as a FAC aircraft (OA-10). Pilots continued their previous mission of providing AFAC and Combat Search and Rescue, although in a much more combat-worthy fighter. The A-10 allowed the wing to take part in the new deployments to Southwest Asia following Operation Desert Storm. The unit was re-designated as the 111th Fighter Group in 1992 and then as the 111th Fighter Wing in 1995. Participating in Operation Southern Watch, the wing took advantage of this aircraft upgrade by volunteering for a 90-day deployment to Kuwait in 1995, to support joint combat flight operations for Operation Southern Watch over Iraq. Twelve aircraft were deployed to Al Jaber AB – a joint-use base by U.S. and Kuwait Air Forces. The base was fairly austere as it had suffered considerable war-damage from Desert Storm. Missions included Combat Search and Rescue alert, Kill Box flights over Iraq, Airborne Forward Air Control and joint training missions over Kuwait. About 40% of the wing participated in the deployment Another interesting element was a small side deployment to Qatar. The 111th was the first Air Guard fighter unit deployed to Al Jaber and also the first ANG Wing to volunteer for a solo 3-month Operation Southern Watch deployment. The combat flight missions over Iraq were to enforce United Nations resolutions and occurred during the 1990s post Cold War era. Ground Support In 1996, the 111th FW pilots transitioned from the OA-10 AFAC mission to the universal A-10 \\"attack\\" mission. Now the pilots' primary task was to provide Close Air Support (CAS) for joint service ground forces, as well as performing AFAC and CSAR duties as before. This change to the normal A-10 role aligned the wing with all the other A-10 units in the active duty and Air Reserve Component (ARC). The second 111th FW deployment to Al Jaber AB occurred in 1999, again to support joint combat flight operations for Operation Southern Watch over Iraq. Missions included Combat Search and Rescue alert, Kill Box flights over Iraq, Airborne Forward Air Control and joint training missions over Kuwait. Use of the A-10 was more limited than before, due to the aircraft's relative lack of a precision weapon capability [except the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground tactical missile]. Global War on Terrorism Immediately following the 9/11 attacks on NYC and Washington, DC, the 111th FW voluntarily deployed on very short notice back to Al Jaber AB to support joint combat flight operations for Operation Southern Watch over Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom over Afghanistan. Missions included Combat Search and Rescue alert and joint training missions over Kuwait. 111th Weapons personnel assisted in the loading of combat ordnance for the first sorties into Afghanistan in November 2001. From October 2002 – January 2003, the wing was the lead unit for a short notice, voluntary, out-of-cycle AEF deployment to Bagram AB, Afghanistan. Bagram had been a massive Soviet base during the decade when they occupied Afghanistan (1979–89), but was almost completely destroyed in that period and civil war afterwards. The 111th aircraft supported joint combat flight operations with US Army, Special Forces, and coalition ground forces in Afghanistan. The A-10s were flown and maintained in the most primitive conditions, yet the 111th personnel flew 100% of the assigned tasking for their entire deployment – at four times the normal sortie rate of home. Other unique aspects of the operation were total 'blacked out' night-time operations (no lights on the field or camp – everything was done by night vision goggles); an extensive number of mines/UXOs around and on the air field; extreme weather conditions and enemy shelling using BM-12 107mm rockets. Operation Iraqi Freedom Upon returning to the U.S. in January 2003, the 111th FW again volunteered to participate in another SWA deployment to Al Jaber AB, Kuwait [fourth visit] from February 2003 – May 2003. The wing deployed for joint combat flight operations, in support of US Army, Marine and British ground forces as part of the initial phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Wing personnel were initially stationed at Al Jaber before transferring to Tallil AB, Iraq, midway through the initial campaign. Tallil was a former Iraqi air force base, which had not been used in a decade. During this campaign, which included direct support for coalition armor forces during the entire invasion from the Kuwait border, through Basra and Baghdad, the wing pilots and maintainers successfully operated at a very high sortie rate. Tallil AB operations set another milestone due to its austere nature and forward location (which was essential to support the armor's thrust toward the capital). The 111th Fighter Wing's achievement of voluntarily deploying to austere bases in two separate combat operations within a five-month period [2003] was part of the reason the unit was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, with Valor, in 2005. It also was awarded the Reserve Family Readiness Award in 2003 and the ANG Distinguished Flying Unit Award in 2004. In 2009, the 111th Security Forces Squadron was voted best Security Forces Squadron in the entire Air Force. TSgt Marc Berger was voted top cop in the entire Air Force also in 2009, the first member of the 111th SFS to receive such an illustrious award. TSgt Berger indicated he owed this great accomplishment to CMSgt Jimmy Finn, who was his mentor and his teacher. BRAC 2005 103d Fighter Squadron inactivation In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended the 111th Fighter Wing be inactivated its assigned A-10 aircraft relocated to the 124th Wing (ANG), Boise Air Terminal Air Guard Station, Boise, ID (three primary aircraft); 175th Wing (ANG), Warfield Air National Guard Base, Baltimore, MD, (three primary aircraft); 127th Wing (ANG), Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Mount Clemens, MI (three primary aircraft) and retire the remaining aircraft (six primary aircraft). This recommendation was part of a larger recommendation that would close NAS JRB Willow Grove, PA. DoD claimed that this recommendation would enable Air Force Future Total Force transformation by consolidating the A-10 fleet at installations of higher military value. Despite appeals from Ed Rendell, the Governor of Pennsylvania, the recommendations were upheld and the A-10s departed during 2010. The 103d Fighter Squadron inactivated on 31 March 2011. On 19 March 2013, it was announced that the 111th Fighter Wing would be re- equipped to take over ground control of the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).Horsham Air Guard Base to operate unmanned drones. =Lineage= 391st Bombardment Group emblem 111th Air Defense Wing – Emblem 103d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron emblem 103d Fighter Squadron Operation Southern Watch Emblem * 111th Operations Group : Constituted as 391st Bombardment Group (Medium) on 15 January 1943 : Activated on 21 January 1943 : Inactivated on 25 October 1945 : Redesignated 111th Bombardment Group (Light), and allotted to Pennsylvania ANG on 24 May 1946 : Extended federal recognition on 20 December 1948 : Redesignated 111th Composite Group on 1 November 1950 and assigned as subordinate unit to 111th Air Defense Wing: Redesignated 111th Bombardment Group, 1 February 1951 : Ordered to active federal service on 1 April 1951 : Redesignated 111th Strategic Reconnaissance Group, 1 August 1951 : Relieved from active federal service and returned to Pennsylvania Commonwealth control on 15 November 1952 : Redesignated 111th Fighter-Bomber Group, 1 January 1953 : Redesignated 111th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 1 July 1955 : Redesignated 111th Air Transport Group, 1 April 1962 : Redesignated 111th Military Airlift Group, 8 January 1966 : Redesignated 111th Tactical Air Support Group, 27 May 1969 : Inactivated on 30 June 1974 : Reactivated and redesignated 111th Operations Group, 1 October 1995 : Inactivated on 31 March 2011 : Reactivated in 2016 * 111th Fighter Wing: Established as 111th Air Defense Wing, and allotted to Pennsylvania ANG, 31 October 1950 : Organized and received federal recognition, 1 November 1950, assuming personnel and equipment of 53d Fighter Wing (Inactivated) : Redesignated 111th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, 1 July 1955 : Redesignated 111th Air Transport Wing, 1 April 1962 : Redesignated 111th Military Airlift Wing, 8 January 1966 : Redesignated 111th Tactical Air Support Wing, 27 May 1969 : Redesignated 111th Fighter Wing, 15 March 1992 : Redesignated 111th Attack Wing, 1 April 2011 =Assignments= * Third Air Force, 21 January 1943 * 99th Bombardment Wing, 25 January 1944 – 27 July 1945 * Army Service Forces (for inactivation), 24–25 October 1945 * 53d Fighter Wing, 20 December 1948 * Pennsylvania Air National Guard, 1 November 1951 : Gained by: Eastern Air Defense Force, Air Defense Command : Gained by: New York Air Defense Sector, Air Defense Command, 1 October 1956 : Gained by: Eastern Transport Air Force, (EASTAF), Military Air Transport Service, 1 April 1962 : Gained by: Twenty- First Air Force, Military Airlift Command, 8 January 1966 : Gained by: Tactical Air Command, 27 May 1969 : Gained by: Air Combat Command, 1 June 1992–Present =Components= World War II * 572d Bombardment Squadron (P2), 21 January 1943 – 25 October 1945 * 573d Bombardment Squadron (T6), 21 January 1943 – 25 October 1945 * 574th Bombardment Squadron (4L), 21 January 1943 – 25 October 1945 * 575th Bombardment Squadron (O8), 21 January 1943 – 25 October 1945 Pennsylvania Air National Guard * 111th Composite (later Bombardment, Strategic Reconnaissance, Fighter-Bomber) Group, 1 November 1951 – 1 July 1955 : Re-designated: 111th Operations Group, 1 October 1995 – 31 Mar 2011 * 103d Bombardment (later Strategic Reconnaissance, Fighter-Bomber, Fighter-Interceptor, Air Transport, Military Airlift, Tactical Air Support, Fighter, Attack) Squadron, 20 December 1948 – 15 November 1952; 1 January 1953 – 31 Mar 2011; ??

Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.National Cancer Institute Dictionary of Cancer Terms. c-kit. Accessed October 13, 2014. KIT was first described by the German biochemist Axel Ullrich in 1987 as the cellular homolog of the feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit.  Function  KIT is a cytokine receptor expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells as well as other cell types. Altered forms of this receptor may be associated with some types of cancer. KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase type III, which binds to stem cell factor (a substance that causes certain types of cells to grow), also known as \\"steel factor\\" or \\"c-kit ligand\\". When this receptor binds to stem cell factor (SCF) it forms a dimer that activates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, that in turn phosphorylates and activates signal transduction molecules that propagate the signal in the cell. After activation, the receptor is ubiquitinated to mark it for transport to a lysosome and eventual destruction. Signaling through KIT plays a role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. For instance, KIT signaling is required for melanocyte survival, and it is also involved in haematopoiesis and gametogenesis.  Structure  Like other members of the receptor tyrosine kinase III family, KIT consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular domain is composed of five immunoglobulin-like domains, and the protein kinase domain is interrupted by a hydrophilic insert sequence of about 80 amino acids. The ligand stem cell factor binds via the second and third immunoglobulin domains.  Cell surface marker  Cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules are markers on the cell surface, as recognized by specific sets of antibodies, used to identify the cell type, stage of differentiation and activity of a cell. KIT is an important cell surface marker used to identify certain types of hematopoietic (blood) progenitors in the bone marrow. To be specific, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), multipotent progenitors (MPP), and common myeloid progenitors (CMP) express high levels of KIT. Common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) express low surface levels of KIT. KIT also identifies the earliest thymocyte progenitors in the thymus—early T lineage progenitors (ETP/DN1) and DN2 thymocytes express high levels of c-Kit. It is also a marker for mouse prostate stem cells. In addition, mast cells, melanocytes in the skin, and interstitial cells of Cajal in the digestive tract express KIT. In humans, expression of c-kit in helper-like innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) which lack the expression of CRTH2 (CD294) is used to mark the ILC3 population.  Mobilization  Hematopoietic progenitor cells are normally present in the blood at low levels. Mobilization is the process by which progenitors are made to migrate from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, thus increasing their numbers in the blood. Mobilization is used clinically as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Signaling through KIT has been implicated in mobilization. At the current time, G-CSF is the main drug used for mobilization; it indirectly activates KIT. Plerixafor (an antagonist of CXCR4-SDF1) in combination with G-CSF, is also being used for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Direct KIT agonists are currently being developed as mobilization agents.  Role in cancer  Activating mutations in this gene are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, testicular seminoma, mast cell disease, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, while inactivating mutations are associated with the genetic defect piebaldism. =Anti-KIT therapies= KIT is a proto-oncogene, meaning that overexpression or mutations of this protein can lead to cancer. Seminomas, a subtype of testicular germ cell tumors, frequently have activating mutations in exon 17 of KIT. In addition, the gene encoding KIT is frequently overexpressed and amplified in this tumor type, most commonly occurring as a single gene amplicon. Mutations of KIT have also been implicated in leukemia, a cancer of hematopoietic progenitors, melanoma, mast cell disease, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The efficacy of imatinib (trade name Gleevec), a KIT inhibitor, is determined by the mutation status of KIT: When the mutation has occurred in exon 11 (as is the case many times in GISTs), the tumors are responsive to imatinib. However, if the mutation occurs in exon 17 (as is often the case in seminomas and leukemias), the receptor is not inhibited by imatinib. In those cases other inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib can be used. Researchers investigated the dynamic behavior of wild type and mutant D816H KIT receptor, and emphasized the extended A-loop (EAL) region (805-850) by conducting computational analysis. Their atomic investigation of mutant KIT receptor which emphasized on the EAL region provided a better insight into the understanding of the sunitinib resistance mechanism of the KIT receptor and could help to discover new therapeutics for KIT-based resistant tumor cells in GIST therapy. The preclinical agent, KTN0182A, is an anti-KIT, pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)-containing antibody-drug conjugate which shows anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo against a range of tumor types.KTN0182A, an Anti-KIT, Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)-Containing Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) Demonstrates Potent Antitumor Activity In Vitro and In Vivo Against a Broad Range of Tumor Types; Lubeski C, Kemp GC, Von Bulow CL, Howard PW, Hartley JA, Douville T, Wellbrock J, et al.; 11th Annual PEGS - The Essential Protein Engineering Summit, Boston, 2015 = Diagnostic relevance = Antibodies to KIT are widely used in immunohistochemistry to help distinguish particular types of tumour in histological tissue sections. It is used primarily in the diagnosis of GISTs, which are positive for KIT, but negative for markers such as desmin and S-100, which are positive in smooth muscle and neural tumors, which have a similar appearance. In GISTs, KIT staining is typically cytoplasmic, with stronger accentuation along the cell membranes. KIT antibodies can also be used in the diagnosis of mast cell tumours and in distinguishing seminomas from embryonal carcinomas.

Marine animals with a larva typically release many larvae into the water column, where the larvae develop before metamorphosing into adults. Marine larvae can disperse over long distances, although determining the actual distance is challenging, because of their size and the lack of a good tracking method. Knowing dispersal distances is important for managing fisheries, effectively designing marine reserves, and controlling invasive species.  Theories on the evolution of a biphasic life history  Larval dispersal is one of the most important topics in marine ecology, today. Many marine invertebrates and many fishes have a bi-phasic life cycle with a pelagic larva or pelagic eggs that can be transported over long distances, and a demersal or benthic adult.Grosberg, R.K. and D.R. Levitan. 1992. For adults only? Supply-side ecology and the history of larval biology. Trends Ecol. Evol. 7: 130-133. There are several theories behind why these organisms have evolved this biphasic life history:Swearer, S. E., J. S. Shima, M. E. Hellberg, S. R. Thorrold, G. P. Jones, D. R. Robertson, S. G. Morgan, K. A. Selkoe, G. M. Ruiz, and R. R. Warner. 2002. Evidence of self-recruitment in demersal marine populations. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 251-271. *Larvae use different food sources than adults, which decreases competition between life stages. *Pelagic larvae can disperse large distances, colonize new territory, and move away from habitats that has become overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable. *A long pelagic larval phase can help a species to break its parasite cycles. *Pelagic larvae avoid benthic predators. Dispersing as pelagic larvae can be risky. For example, while larvae do avoid benthic predators, they are still exposed to pelagic predators in the water column.  Larval development strategies  Marine larvae develop via one of three strategies: Direct, lecithotrophic, or planktotrophic. Each strategy has risks of predation and the difficulty of finding a good settlement site. Direct developing larvae look like the adult. They have typically very low dispersal potential, and are known as “crawl-away larvae,” because they crawl away from their egg after hatching. Some species of frogs and snails hatch this way. Lecithotrophic larvae have greater dispersal potential than direct developers. Many fish species and some benthic invertebrates have lecithotrophic larvae, which have yolk droplets or a yolk sac for nutrition during dispersal. Though some lecithotrophic species can feed in the water column, too. But many, such as tunicates, cannot, and so must settle before depleting their yolk. Consequently, these species have short pelagic larval durations and do not disperse long distances. Planktotrophic larvae feed while they are in the water column and can be over a long time pelagic and so disperse over long distances. This disperse ability is a key adaptation of benthic marine invertebrates.Strathmann, R. R., T. P. Hughes, A. M. Kuris, K. C. Lindeman, S. G. Morgan, J. M. Pandolfi, and R. R. Warner. 2002. Evolution of local recruitment and its consequences for marine populations. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 377-396. Planktotrophic larvae feed on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, including other larvae. Planktotrophic development is the most common type of larval development, especially among benthic invertebrates. Because planktotrophic larvae are for a long time in the water column and recruit successfully with low probability, early researchers developed the “lottery hypothesis”, which states that animals release huge numbers of larvae to increase the chances that at least one will survive, and that larvae cannot influence their probability of success.Thorson, G. 1950. Reproductive and larval ecology of marine bottom invertebrates. Biol. Rev. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 25: 1-45.Roughgarden, J., Y. Iwasa, and C. Blaxter. 1985. Demographic theory for an open population with space-limited recruitment. Ecology 66: 54-67.Caley, M.J., M.H. Carr, M.A. Hixon, T.P. Hughes, G.P. Jones, and B. Menge. 1996. Recruitment and the local dynamics of open marine populations. Evolution 35: 1192-1205. This hypothesis views larval survival and successful recruitment as chance events, which numerous studies on larval behavior and ecology have since shown to be false.Kingsford, M. J., J. M. Leis, A. Shanks, K. C. Lindeman, S. G. Morgan, and J. Pineda. 2002. Sensory environments, larval abilities, and local self- recruitment. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 309-340. Though it has been generally disproved, the larval lottery hypothesis represents an important understanding of the difficulties faced by larvae during their time in the water column.  Predator defense  Predation is a major threat to marine larvae, which are an important food source for many organisms. Invertebrate larvae in estuaries are particularly at risk because estuaries are nursery grounds for planktivorous fishes. Larvae have evolved strategies to cope with this threat, including direct defense and avoidance. = Direct defense = Direct defense can include protective structures and chemical defenses. Most planktivorous fishes are gape-limited predators, meaning their prey is determined by the width of their open mouths, making larger larvae difficult to ingest. One study proved that spines serve a protective function by removing spines from estuarine crab larvae and monitoring differences in predation rates between de-spined and intact larvae.Morgan, S. G. 1989. Adaptive significance of spination in estuarine crab zoeae. Ecology 70: 462-482. The study also showed that predator defense is also behavioral, as they can keep spines relaxed but erect them in the presence of predators. = Avoidance = Larvae can avoid predators on small and large spatial scales. Some larvae do this by sinking when approached by a predator. A more common avoidance strategy is to become active at night and remain hidden during the day to avoid visual predators. Most larvae and plankton undertake diel vertical migrations between deeper waters with less light and fewer predators during the day and shallow waters in the photic zone at night, where microalgae is abundant.Zaret, T.M. and J.S. Suffern. 1976. Vertical migration in zooplankton as a predator avoidance. Limnol. Oceanogr. 21: 804-813. Estuarine invertebrate larvae avoid predators by developing in the open ocean, where there are fewer predators. This is done using reverse tidal vertical migrations. Larvae use tidal cycles and estuarine flow regimes to aid their departure to the ocean, a process that is well-studied in many estuarine crab species.Cronin, T.W. and R.B. Forward, Jr. 1979. Tidal vertical migration: An endogenous rhythm in estuarine crab larvae. Science 205: 1020-1022.Tankersley, R.A. and R.B. Forward, Jr. 1994.

Endogenous tidal rhythms of vertical migration in field collected zoea-1 larvae of the shore crab Carcinus maenas: implications for ebb-tide offshore dispersal. Mar. Ecol. Prog.

Vertical migration behavior and horizontal distribution of brachyuran larvae in a low-inflow estuary: implications for bay-ocean exchange. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 217: 191-206. An example of reverse tidal migration performed by crab species would begin with larvae being released on a nocturnal spring high tide to limit predation by planktivorous fishes. As the tide begins to ebbs, larvae swim to the surface to be carried away from the spawning site. When the tide begins to flood, larvae swim to the bottom, where water moves more slowly due to the boundary layer. When the tide again changes back to ebb, the larvae swim to the surface waters and resume their journey to the ocean. Depending on the length of the estuary and the speed of the currents, this process can take anywhere from one tidal cycle to several days.Forward, R.B. Jr, and R.A. Tankersley. 2001. Selective tidal-stream transport of marine animals. Oceanogr. Mar. Biol. Annu. Rev. 39: 305-353.  Dispersal and settlement  The most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of a pelagic larval stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. Sessile and sedentary organisms such as barnacles, tunicates, and mussels require a mechanism to move their young into new territory, since they cannot move long distances as adults. Many species have relatively long pelagic larval durations on the order of weeks or months.Brothers, E.B., D.M. Williams, and P.F. Sale. 1983. Length of larval life in twelve families of fishes at “One Tree Lagoon,” Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Mar. Biol. 76: 319-324.Scheltema, R.S. 1986. On dispersal and planktonic larvae of benthic invertebrates: an eclectic overview and summary of problems. Bull. Mar. Sci. 39: 290-322. During this time, larvae feed and grow, and many species metamorphose through several stages of development. For example, barnacles molt through six naupliar stages before becoming a cyprid and seeking appropriate settlement substrate. This strategy can be risky. Some larvae have been shown to be able to delay their final metamorphosis for a few days or weeks, and most species cannot delay it at all.Gebauer, P., K. Paschke, and K. Anger. 2004. Stimulation of metamorphosis in an estuarine crab, Chasmagnathus granulata (Dana, 1851): temporal window of cue receptivity. J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 311: 25-36.Goldstein, J.S., M.J. Butler IV, and H. Matsuda. 2006. Investigations into some early-life history strategies for Caribbean spiny lobster and implications for pan-carib connectivity. J. Shellfish Res. 25: 731. If these larvae metamorphose far from a suitable settlement site, they perish. Many invertebrate larvae have evolved complex behaviors and endogenous rhythms to ensure successful and timely settlement. Many estuarine species exhibit swimming rhythms of reverse tidal vertical migration to aid in their transport away from their hatching site. Individuals can also exhibit tidal vertical migrations to reenter the estuary when they are competent to settle.Christy, J.H. and S.G. Morgan. 1998. Estuarine immigration by crab postlarvae: mechanisms, reliability and adaptive significance. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 174: 51-65. As larvae reach their final pelagic stage, they become much more tactile; clinging to anything larger than themselves. One study observed crab postlarvae and found that they would swim vigorously until they encountered a floating object, which they would cling to for the remainder of the experiment.Shanks, Alan L. 1985. Behavioral basis of internal-wave-induced shoreward transport of megalopae of the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes. Marine Ecol. Prog. Series 24: 289-295. It was hypothesized that by clinging to floating debris, crabs can be transported towards shore due to the oceanographic forces of internal waves, which carry floating debris shoreward regardless of the prevailing currents. Once returning to shore, settlers encounter difficulties concerning their actual settlement and recruitment into the population. Space is a limiting factor for sessile invertebrates on rocky shores. Settlers must be wary of adult filter feeders, which cover substrate at settlement sites and eat particles the size of larvae. Settlers must also avoid becoming stranded out of water by waves, and must select a settlement site at the proper tidal height to prevent desiccation and avoid competition and predation. To overcome many of these difficulties, some species rely on chemical cues to assist them in selecting an appropriate settlement site. These cues are usually emitted by adult conspecifics, but some species cue on specific bacterial mats or other qualities of the substrate.Crisp, D.J. and P.S. Meadows. 1962.

Elliott, and R.N. Mariscal. 1995. Host selection, location, and association behaviors of anemonefishes in field settlement experiments. Mar. Biol. 122: 377-390.  Larval sensory systems  Although with a pelagic larva, many species can increase their dispersal range and decrease the risk of inbreeding, a larva comes with challenges: Marine larvae risk being washed away without finding a suitable habitat for settlement. Therefore, they have evolved many sensory systems: = Sensory systems =  Magnetic fields  Far from shore, larvae are able to use magnetic fields to orient themselves towards the coast over large spatial scales. There is additional evidence that species can recognize anomalies in the magnetic field to return to the same location multiple times throughout their life. Though the mechanisms that these species use is poorly understood, it appears that magnetic fields play an important role in larval orientation offshore, where other cues such as sound and chemicals may be difficult to detect.  Vision and non-visual light perception  Phototaxis (ability to differentiate between light and dark areas) is important to find a suitable habitat. Phototaxis evolved relatively quickly and taxa that lack developed eyes, such as schyphozoans, use phototaxis to find shaded areas to settle away from predators. Phototaxis is not the only mechanism that guides larvae by light. The larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii do not only show positive and negative phototaxis over a broad range of the light spectrum, but swim down to the center of gravity when they are exposed to non-directional UV-light. This behavior is a UV-induced positive gravitaxis. This gravitaxis and negative phototaxis induced by light coming from the water surface form a ratio-metric depth-gauge. Such a depth gauge is based on the different attenuation of light across the different wavelengths in water. In clear water blue light (470 nm) penetrates the deepest. And so the larvae need only to compare the two wavlength ranges UV/violet (< 420 nm) and the other wavelengths to find their preferred depth. Species that produce more complex larvae, such as fish, can use full vision to find a suitable habitat on small spatial scales. Larvae of damselfish use vision to find and settle near adults of their species.  Sound  Marine larvae use sound and vibrations to find a good habitat where they can settle and metamorphose into juveniles. This behavior has been seen in fish as well as in the larvae of scleractinian corals. Many families of coral reef fish are particularly attracted to high-frequency sounds produced by invertebrates, which larvae use as an indicator of food availability and complex habitat where they may be protected from predators. It is thought that larvae avoid low frequency sounds because they may be associated with transient fish or predators and is therefore not a reliable indicator of safe habitat. The spatial range at which larvae detect and use sound waves is still uncertain, though some evidence suggests that it may only be reliable at very small scales. There is concern that changes in community structure in nursery habitats, such as seagrass beds, kelp forests, and mangroves, could lead to a collapse in larval recruitment due to a decrease in sound-producing invertebrates. Other researchers argue that larvae may still successfully find a place to settle even if one cue is unreliable.  Olfaction  Many marine organisms use olfaction (chemical cues in the form of scent) to locate a safe area to metamorphose at the end of their larval stage. This has been shown in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Research has shown that larvae are able to distinguish between water from the open ocean and water from more suitable nursery habitats such as lagoons and seagrass beds. Chemical cues can be extremely useful for larvae, but may not have a constant presence, as water input can depend on currents and tidal flow. = Human impacts on sensory systems = Recent research in the field of larval sensory biology has begun focusing more on how human impacts and environmental disturbance affect settlement rates and larval interpretation of different habitat cues. Ocean acidification due to anthropogenic climate change and sedimentation have become areas of particular interest.  Ocean acidification  Ocean acidification has been shown to alter the way that pelagic larvae are able to process information and production of the cues themselves. Acidification can alter larval interpretations of sounds, particularly in fish, leading to settlement in suboptimal habitat. Though the mechanism for this process is still not fully understood, some studies indicate that this breakdown may be due to a decrease in size or density of their otoliths. Furthermore, sounds produced by invertebrates that larvae rely on as an indicator of habitat quality can also change due to acidification. For example, snapping shrimp produce different sounds that larvae may not recognize under acidified conditions due to differences in shell calcification. Hearing is not the only sense that may be altered under future ocean chemistry conditions. Evidence also suggests that larval ability to process olfactory cues was also affected when tested under future pH conditions. Red color cues that coral larvae use to find crustose coralline algae, with which they have a commensal relationship, may also be in danger due to algal bleaching.  Sedimentation  Sediment runoff, from natural storm events or human development, can also impact larval sensory systems and survival. One study focusing on red soil found that increased turbidity due to runoff negatively influenced the ability of fish larvae to interpret visual cues. More unexpectedly, they also found that red soil can also impair olfactory capabilities.  Self-recruitment  Marine ecologists are often interested in the degree of self-recruitment in populations. Historically, larvae were considered passive particles that were carried by ocean currents to faraway locations. This led to the belief that all marine populations were demographically open, connected by long distance larval transport. Recent work has shown that many populations are self- recruiting, and that larvae and juveniles are capable of purposefully returning to their natal sites. Researchers take a variety of approaches to estimating population connectivity and self-recruitment, and several studies have demonstrated their feasibility. Jones et al.Jones, G. P., M. J. Milicich, M. J. Emslie and C. Lunow. 1999. Self-recruitment in a coral reef fish population. Nature 402: 802-804. and Swearer et al.,Swearer, S. E., J. E. Caselle, D. W. Lea, and R. R. Warner. 1999. Larval rentention and recruitment in an island population of a coral-reef fish. Nature 402: 799-802. for example, investigated the proportion of fish larvae returning to their natal reef. Both studies found higher than expected self-recruitment in these populations using mark, release, and recapture sampling. These studies were the first to provide conclusive evidence of self-recruitment in a species with the potential to disperse far from its natal site, and laid the groundwork for numerous future studies.Levin, L. 2006. Recent progress in understanding larval dispersal: new directions and digressions. Int. Comp. Biol. 46: 282-297.  Conservation  Ichthyoplankton have a high mortality rate as they transition their food source from yolk sac to zooplankton. It is proposed that this mortality rate is related to inadequate zooplankton as well as an inability to move through the water effectively at this stage of development, leading to starvation. Many ichthyoplankton use suction to feed. Turgidity of water impairs the organisms’ ability to feed even when there is a high density of prey. Reducing these hydrodynamic constraints on cultivated populations could lead to higher yields for repopulation efforts and has been proposed as a means of conserving fish populations by acting at the larval level.China, V., and R. Holzman. 2014. Hydrodynamic starvation in first-feeding larval fishes. PNAS doi:10.1073/pnas.1323205111. A network of marine reserves has been initiated for the conservation of the world’s marine larval populations. These areas restrict fishing and therefore increase the number of otherwise fished species. This leads to a healthier ecosystem and affects the number of overall species within the reserve as compared to nearby fished areas; however, the full effect of an increase in larger predator fish on larval populations is not currently known. Also, the potential for utilizing the motility of fish larvae to repopulate the water surrounding the reserve is not fully understood. Marine reserves are a part of a growing conservation effort to combat overfishing; however, reserves still only comprise about 1% of the world’s oceans. These reserves are also not protected from other human-derived threats, such as chemical pollutants, so they cannot be the only method of conservation without certain levels of protection for the water around them as well.Bohnsack, J. A. 1992. Reef resource habitat protection: the forgotten factor. Marine Recreational Fisheries 14: 117-129. For effective conservation, it is important to understand the larval dispersal patterns of the species in danger, as well as the dispersal of invasive species and predators which could impact their populations. Understanding these patterns is an important factor when creating protocol for governing fishing and creating reserves. A single species may have multiple dispersal patterns. The spacing and size of marine reserves must reflect this variability to maximize their beneficial effect. Species with shorter dispersal patterns are more likely to be affected by local changes and require higher priority for conservation because of the separation of subpopulations.Jones, G. P., M. Srinivasan, and G. R. Almany. 2007. Conservation of marine biodiversity. Oceanography 20: 100-111.  Implications  The principles of marine larval ecology can be applied in other fields, too whether marine or not. Successful fisheries management relies heavily on understanding population connectivity and dispersal distances, which are driven by larvae. Dispersal and connectivity must also be considered when designing natural reserves. If populations are not self- recruiting, reserves may lose their species assemblages. Many invasive species can disperse over long distances, including the seeds of land plants and larvae of marine invasive species. Understanding the factors influencing their dispersal is key to controlling their spread and managing established populations.

He is based upon and portrayed by Patrick Beriault. Sensei Rio is a member of Team Xtreme and a 2nd degree black belt in Mugen Budo. Rio lives life to the fullest. He's a bit of a thrill seeker, and at times will get himself into situations that would make even the most daring cringe! With extensive training with the NX Secret, Rio has achieved Macaco Budo. Incredible agility and fluidity is not the only advantages of this power, Rio is also able to momentarily defy the laws of gravity to walk on walls, climb and jump very high. In the siege of episode 112, \\"Full Circle\\", Rio confronted Ronin. He quickly realised that kicks and punches were no match against the brute strength of the Oni-Clone. Using his power, Rio confused Ronin, tied him up with rope, trapping him while heavy skids and wooden crates fell on him, finally putting him out of action. Spike Spike is a fictional character in NX Files. He is based upon and portrayed by Renshi Alain Moussi, co-owner of NX Martial Arts and Fitness. He is a lead character in the show. Renshi Spike is one of NX Team Xtreme's dynamic leaders, and its highest- ranking member. Spike holds a 4th degree black belt in the art of Mugen Budo Jiu-Jitsu. It has been several years since Spike, his best friends Rex and Tornado formed the elite Martial Arts group Team Xtreme. Spike is head strong, a natural leader and a passionate teacher and student of the martial arts. He is no doubt the most serious member of the Team, calm and always focused. His fighting style is powerful but fluid, his kicks are precise and effective. He has developed the ability of Phantom Budo and can create fighting apparitions of himself at will. Although Phantom Budo is an incredibly powerful ability, Spike has yet to fully develop this awesome fighting technique. He has also shown a slight use of Mystic Budo from time to time. In episode 108, \\"Origins II – Enter Lord Tragos\\", he was able to telekinetically open the door even when Tornado was forcing it closed. Spike is the only member of the team who has had frequent council from the strange beings known as Mr. Black and Mr. Brown. They have guided him and warned him of the strange and unbelievable events that have taken part so far. During the siege of Full Circle, Spike was the first to encounter the fury of Akuma. Spike managed to overtake the deadly demon and defeat him. Unfortunately, Spike was not so lucky when the evil Lord Tragos confronted and attacked the team in the warehouse. Tragos overpowered Spike and attempted to use his Kara Takai Technique but Spike resisted. Mr. Black then appeared out of the ether and told Spike to 'let go'. Spike finally put his faith in Mr. Black and succumbed to the powerful dark forces of Tragos. Ronin Ronin is a fictional character in NX Files. He is portrayed by Alain Moussi. Ronin is an Oni-Clone of Spike. He looks identical to Spike but has red hair and a large black tattoo that covers most of his right arm and shoulder. Although he possesses the same physical characteristics as Spike, he is in fact quite different. In battle, Ronin does not utilize the same finesse as Spike; he prefers to quickly overpower and destroy his opponent. Ronin was Tragos' first attempt at creating an Oni-Clone; however it may not be his last. Ronin first proved his worth by fighting Tragos' top student Malak. During the final siege of Full Circle, Ronin confronted the amazing Sensei Rio in battle. Ronin dominated this fight however he was outwitted by Rio's brilliant strategy and use of the unpredictable Macaco Budo. Using a long tie-down strap, Rio tangled his blood thirsty opponent and left him trapped while heavy wooden crates and skids fell upon him. Rex Rex is a fictional character in NX Files. He is based upon and portrayed by Sensei Stephan Roy, co-owner of NX Martial Arts and Fitness. He is a lead character in the show. Sensei Rex is the other brave leader of Team Xtreme. Rex holds a 3rd Dan in Mugen Budo Jiu-Jitsu and a master at numerous weapons and fighting systems just like his lifelong friends Spike and Tornado. Sometimes the joker, he is adept at keeping the Team on their toes, even at the most inopportune times! Through his training with the NX Secret, Rex has developed the power of Sonic Budo. With this lightning speed ability, he can tip the odds, no matter how crazy the circumstances. Apart from the villainous Lord Tragos who threatens the whole team, Rex seems to have found his own nemesis; Malak. These two characters first crossed swords in The Infiltrator when the slimy Malak attempted to infiltrate the Dojo and steal the NX Secret. During the events of Full Circle, Malak confronted Rex for the second time; he was forced to run away once again as Rex proved too powerful for him. These humiliating defeats only fuel Malak's anger and determination. It is safe to say that Rex has not seen the last of his nemesis. Sniper Sniper is a fictional character in NX Files. He is based upon and portrayed by Marc Knowles Sensei Sniper is a member of Team Xtreme and a 2nd degree black belt in Mugen Budo. He is the technology guru of the group; he holds an advanced doctorate in computer sciences. Sniper created and built most of the systems in the NX Chambers including the quirky NX Intelligence Security System (NXISS). The NX Secret has given Sniper the power of Accu Budo; enhanced vision and reflexes make his punches and kicks incredibly fast and precise. A single strike delivered to a vital nerve is usually enough for Sniper to incapacitate an opponent. During the events of Parallel Terror, Sniper attempted a radical experiment; he connected his computer systems directly into the NX Secret in order to provide NXISS with an unlimited source of power. The experiment failed and created a rift in the space-time fabric. A rift is an unstable portal or doorway to another dimension, and/or another time. Sniper was the first to encounter a Hybrid, who emerged from the rift. With the help of Mr. Black, Sniper defeated the hyena-like beast. In a final noble act of sacrifice, Sniper jumped through the rift in order to close it, trapping himself on the other side. Akuma Akuma is a fictional character in NX Files. He has been portrayed by Peter Moscone, Marc Knowles, Alain Moussi and Eric Gratton. Akuma is an evil demon spirit created by Mugen Kurai. The demons' essence and spirit reside within his mask. However, in order to interact and fight in the physical world, Akuma requires a body, a host. Once Akuma's mask comes in contact with someone's face, he immediately possesses the victim and gains complete control of him or her. Akuma is recognizable by his red and black gi, black eyes and of course, his dark red mask. Akuma is an exceptional fighter, very quick and agile; his kicks even rival Spike's. He has a unique fighting style but will also inherit the styles of whoever he possesses. Akuma does not have a specific special ability like others but he does however have certain capabilities that are out of this world. Katana Katana is a fictional character in NX Files. She is based upon and portrayed by Emilie Lavoie. Sensei Katana brings grace and refinement to Team Xtreme. She holds a 1st degree back belt in Mugen Budo Jiu-Jitsu and is an adept at many weapons and fighting styles. She is a cool customer when facing off against any opponent. She is known for her swift and strong techniques, and can easily defeat her opponents. Through training with the NX Secret, Katana developed Mystic Budo. She has telepathy and very unusual but strong psychic abilities. Reading someone's thoughts, sending telepathic messages, making people believe what she wants them to, etc... these are only a few examples of what this powerful young martial artist can do. Prior to the discovery of the NX Secret, Katana was in a deep and loving relationship with Tornado. They seemed inseparable—until Tornado became corrupted by Mugen Kurai and tried to kill his friends. In \\"Origins 2 – Enter Lord Tragos\\", Tornado defeated Spike, Spike and Sniper in his attempt to steal the NX Secret. Katana tried to talk him out of it; he struck her with an energy blast that should have killed her... but as Mr. Brown explains in \\"Origins 3 – Mugen Kurai\\", \\"something intervened\\". In \\"Full Circle\\", Katana was the first member of Team Xtreme to reach the level of Kimaven. Unconscious and unable to help her team mates, she was somehow still psychically able to feel the pain of her defeated and dying friends. This gave her the edge she needed to transform into Kimaven. With this extraordinary and seemingly unlimited power, she easily defeated Lord Tragos. After killing the dark lord, Katana was struck with a shockwave that knocked her out of her Kimaven stage and rendered her unconscious. Sabre Sabre is a fictional character in NX Files. Sensei Sabre is a 2nd degree black belt in Mugen Budo Jiu-Jitsu and a member of Team Xtreme. He is a brilliant intellect and is very knowledgeable in any subject. An exceptional fighter, Sabre also has the unique ability to talk himself out of any situation. The NX Secret has amplified Sabre's natural abilities and given him the power of Cogno Budo. Sabre sees patterns and clarity where others see only confusion. By examining his environment and his opponent's movements, Sabre can anticipate the outcome of a fight. Using this 'sixth sense', Sabre had no difficulty engaging a Phantom Ninja in Revelations. During Full Circle, Sabre met his match while fighting Saris. Saris' exceptional use of Macaco Budo made it almost impossible for Sabre to calculate her movements. After suffering quite a beating, Sabre was finally able to calculate the outcome. He lured Saris precisely where he wanted... trapped and humiliated behind a loading dock door. Krush Krush is a fictional character in NX Files. He is based upon and portrayed by Robert Baldwin. Sensei Krush is a 2nd degree black belt in Mugen Budo. He was the last member to join Team Xtreme; little is known of his past. Krush is quiet type; in combat however, he fights emotionally which seems to fuel his power but as Mr. Black said in Calm Before the Storm: \\"this could potentially be a problem\\". The NX Secret has given Krush the power of Iron Budo. His strength is unrivaled, his punches are destructive. Apart from Tragos, the only ninja able to face Krush in a fair fist fight is Rico. In Full Circle, Rico surprised Krush with his own use of Iron Budo but it wasn't long before an annoyed and angry Krush overpowered Rico with his brute strength and determination and threw him into a large wooden crate. Mr. Black and Mr. Brown Mr. Black and Mr. Brown are a fictional character in NX Files. He is portrayed by John Purchase. Black and Brown belong to a secret order known as the \\"Archons\\". Archons are tasked with maintaining balance throughout the physical universe. In their native form, Archons are pure energy. Archons are enlightened beings; they have long evolved from the physical form. Black and Brown have taken corporeal form to help blend in while on Earth. Archons have minds that have developed far beyond the confines of human intellect. They have powers that include instant translocation, psychokinetics, and simultaneous interdimensional existence. Although non- corporeal, every archon still possess skills amazing combat, statesman and teaching skills. Among the Archons, Mr. Black is the most senior and powerful member. Black has an alter-being called Mr. Brown. Brown is less experienced than Black. This is apparent as he is much more eager to fight or even destroy an entire planet just to bring an issue to an end. Mr. Black and Mr. Brown first appear on Earth to investigate energy disturbances and episodes of imbalance coinciding with the accidental discovery of the NX Secret. Archons and their governing counsel despise Hybrids. The sentiment is equally shared by the Hybrid brood. Tornado Tornado is a fictional character in NX Files. He is portrayed by Jean-François Lachapelle. Sensei Tornado holds a 3rd degree black belt in Mugen Budo as well as black belts in many other martial arts including Karate. He was the third leader of Team Xtreme along Spike and Rex. Even before discovering the NX Secret, Tornado was always a master at flying kicks and incredible jumps, flips and spins. It is no wonder he got the name 'Tornado'. After discovering the NX Secret, Tornado achieved a form of Mystic Budo. His power however, is quite different from that of Katana's. He has minimal telepathic abilities but extremely developed telekinetic powers. Using only his mind, he can move objects, throw people around, jump extremely high and even levitate for short periods of time. Prior to the discovery of the NX Secret, Tornado and Katana were in love and seemingly destined to marry. This all changed when Tornado's mind became confused and corrupted. For reasons unknown, Tornado's exposure to the NX Secret attracted the dark powers of Mugen Kurai. These evil powers fed his mind with hate and greed, so much so that he became jealous and paranoid of his friends. The more he trained with the NX Secret, the more powerful these negative feelings became. This eventually manifested a new tragic personality inside him; an alter-ego that called itself Tragos. After being asked to leave by his own team mates in Origins 2 – Enter Lord Tragos, Tornado's rage overcame him. Driven by his alter-ego Tragos, not even his beloved Katana could persuade him to stop. In his final confrontation with Spike and Rex, Tornado allowed Tragos to take control. He transformed and became the dark lord himself. Reduced to only a voice in Tragos' head, Tornado regretted his destructive actions and wanted to go back to the way things were. In a final symbolic act in Origins 3 – Mugen Kurai, Tragos crushes a picture in the palm of his hand, silencing the last remaining echoes of his former life. Tornado, the kind and loving Tornado, ceased to exist. Lord Tragos Lord Tragos is a fictional character in NX Files. He was portrayed by Matthew Danielson in episodes 3 to 8 in season 1. He is now portrayed by Eric Robert. Lord Tragos is Team Xtreme's nemesis and the leader of the Kurai Kai. He is an exceptional martial artist and a dangerously powerful practitioner of Mugen Kurai. He wears a long black cloak, mostly used to intimidate his followers but prefers to fight in a black gi and traditional hakama pants. Tragos still mainly uses Tornado's Mystic Budo powers but as since learned many more abilities. Speed, strength, agility, accuracy are only some of the advantages the evil lord possesses. He has also learned how to manipulate energy and on occasion, rise to the level of Oni- Kurai. Lord Tragos was originally a founding member of Team Xtreme. He was known as Tornado. When Tornado became corrupted by Mugen Kurai, the newly created personality named Tragos took over. In his first confrontation with Team Xtreme, Tragos was soundly defeated. After this battle, Tragos seemingly \\"stumbled\\" onto the Book of Mugen Kurai. From this book, his thirst for power grew stronger. He recruited young gang members, trained them and formed the Kurai Kai. Malak was his first student and remains his right-hand man. Although he grows stronger every day with the Book of Mugen Kurai, Tragos still obsesses over the NX Secret; he needs it to satisfy his unending hunger for greater and greater power. After many failed attempts by his ninjas to recover the Secret, Tragos devised a plan to lure Team Xtreme to his hideout. He planned to kill them then simply take NX Secret afterwards. In his final combat in Full Circle, Lord Tragos defeated Team Xtreme and even killed their leader Spike with his Kara Takai ability. He thought victory was his when suddenly an unconscious Katana transformed into Kimaven in a blinding explosion of power. Tragos powered up to Oni-Kurai but it still wasn't enough to destroy her. Tragos died hearing Katana's final words: 'goodbye Tornado'. Malak Malak is a fictional character in NX Files. He is portrayed by Marc- André Terriault. Malak was the first member of the Kurai Kai and the first student of Lord Tragos. No one knows his real name or why he was named Malak. Before being recruited by Tragos, he was local gang leader who organized underground fight clubs. After receiving his initial training, Malak was given the task of recruiting more members for Tragos' army. Most ninjas of the Kurai Kai have been trained in part by Malak, including the formidable Rico and the deadly Saris. Malak was also charged with the duties of finding better facilities for the Kurai Kai Malak is a dirty fighter, he has no problem hitting from behind or running away when a fight isn't going his way. This trait is demonstrated twice with his encounters with Rex. He has also matched Sensei Rex by developing the power of Sonic Budo through his Mugen Kurai training. Saris Saris is a fictional character in NX Files. She is portrayed by Christine Picknell. Saris is a top level ninja of the Kurai Kai. She was trained mostly by Malak but also by Lord Tragos himself. Don't be fooled by her looks, Saris is a trained killing machine. It's no wonder she quickly rose up to become one of Tragos' top students. Saris has developed Macaco Budo, her movements are elegant, graceful and precise. She confuses her opponents with her unpredictable movements. With this advantage, she nearly always dominates the fight. In \\"Full Circle\\", Saris proved quite a challenge for Sabre. Even with his heightened intellect, he could not predict her movements. She was finally outwitted when Sabre lured her away and trapped her behind a door. The fight was over, but Saris was not defeated. Rico Rico is a fictional character in NX Files. He is portrayed by Jeff Burgess Rico is a top level ninja of the Kurai Kai. He was trained by both Malak and Tragos. With his strong build and incredible strength, Rico has no problem taking a hit... but be warned, if you do hit him, he will repay you in kind manyfold! Rico is hot tempered and lacks patience; not traits usually found in a martial artist however he is still a great fighter. Rico uses Iron Budo, and his strength is rivalled only by one: Krush. Rico hates Krush; he has made it his personal objective to become stronger so he can one day destroy him. Rico's first encounter with Krush was in \\"Full Circle\\". He showed Krush just how strong he was; Rico dominated the fight at first but that only frustrated Krush further. He was eventually overpowered and thrown against a wall, taking him out of the action! Kruz Kruz is a fictional character in NX Files. He is based upon and portrayed by Marc-André Gauthier. Sensei Kruz is a 2nd degree black belt in Mugen Budo and a member of Team Xtreme who has been gone for over 5 years. Kruz was a member of the team back in the days before the NX Secret. Five years ago, he went on a journey around the world to learn new and different martial arts and train under countless masters from all over the globe. Kruz is a brilliant post-graduate student of many sciences, including quantum physics. It was Kruz and Sniper who developed many of the systems in the NX Chambers; although Kruz never imagined they would be put to any good use. Golock Golock is a fictional character in NX Files. He is portrayed by Jean-Marc Gagnon.

It may be meant to depict Jesus; if so, it competes with an engraved gem as the earliest known pictorial representation of the Crucifixion of Jesus.Schiller, 89-90, fig. 321 It is hard to date, but has been estimated to have been made c. 200. The image seems to show a young man worshipping a crucified, donkey-headed figure. The Greek inscription approximately translates to \\"Alexamenos worships [his] god,\\" indicating that the graffito was apparently meant to mock a Christian named Alexamenos.  Content  Stone rubbing trace of the drawing. The image depicts a human-like figure affixed to a cross and possessing the head of a donkey or mule. In the top right of the image is what has been interpreted as either the Greek letter upsilon or a tau cross. To the left of the image is a young manapparently intended to represent AlexamenosRodolfo Lanciani, Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries, 1898, chapter 5 'The Palace of the Caesars'as a Roman soldier or guard, raising one hand in a gesture possibly suggesting worship.Thomas Wright, Frederick William Fairholt, A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art, Chatto and Windus, 1875, p. 39 The name Alexamenos (and its Latinate variant Alexamenus) is only attested in this instance, being composed of the common Greek compound elements of (alexo, \\"I defend, help\\") and (menos, \\"strength, bravery, power, etc.\\"). Beneath the cross is a caption written in crude , ALE XAMENOS WORSHIPS DEITY. ϹΕΒΕΤΕ can be understood as a variant spelling (possibly a phonetic misspelling)Rodney J. Decker, The Alexamenos Graffito of Standard Greek ϹΕΒΕΤΑΙ, which means \\"worships\\". The full inscription would then be read as Ᾰλεξᾰ́μενος σέβεται θεόν, \\"Alexamenos worships [his] God\\". Several other sources suggest \\"Alexamenos worshiping a god\\", or similar variants, as the intended translation. In the next chamber, another inscription in a different hand reads (Alexamenos ), Latin for \\"Alexamenos is faithful\\" or \\"Alexamenos the faithful\\". This may be a retort by an unknown party to the mockery of Alexamenos represented in the graffito.  Date  No clear consensus has been reached on when the image was made. Dates ranging from the late 1st to the late 3rd century have been suggested, with the beginning of the 3rd century thought to be the most likely.Schiller, 90  Discovery and location  The graffito was discovered in 1857 when a building called the domus Gelotiana was unearthed on the Palatine Hill. The emperor Caligula had acquired the house for the imperial palace, which, after Caligula died, became used as a Paedagogium (boarding school) for the imperial page boys. Later, the street on which the house sat was walled off to give support to extensions to the buildings above, and it thus remained sealed for centuries.  Interpretation  The inscription is usually taken to be a mocking depiction of a Christian in the act of worship. At the time, pagans derided Christians for worshipping a man who had been crucified. The donkey's head and crucifixion would both have been considered insulting depictions by contemporary Roman society. Crucifixion continued to be used as an execution method for the worst criminals until its abolition by the emperor Constantine in the 4th century, and the impact of seeing a figure on a cross is comparable to the impact today of portraying a man with a hangman's noose around his neck or seated in an electric chair. Already Paul the Apostle wrote that \\"Christ crucified [was] foolishness to Gentiles\\" (1 Corinthians 1:23). It seems to have been commonly believed at the time that Christians practiced onolatry (donkey-worship). That was based on the misconception that Jews worshipped a god in the form of a donkey, a claim made by Apion (30-20 BC – c. AD 45-48):from Against Apion book II, 7, written by Josephus. Tertullian writes: > Origen reports in his treatise Contra Celsum that the pagan philosopher > Celsus made the same claim against Christians and Jews:BOOK VII CHAP. XL. Tertullian, writing in the late 2nd or early 3rd century, reports that Christians, along with Jews, were accused of worshipping such a deity. He also mentions an apostate Jew who carried around Carthage a caricature of a Christian with ass's ears and hooves, labeled Deus Christianorum (\\"The God of the Christians conceived of an ass.\\").Tertullian, Apologeticum, 16, 1 and 12. It has also been suggested that both the graffito and the roughly contemporary gems with Crucifixion images are related to heretical groups outside the Church.Schiller, 89-90 The most common interpretation is that this graffito depicts Jesus of Nazareth. However, Hudson MacLean considers the image can either depict Jesus or Anubis. Other searchers considers that the graffito represents either \\"probably a scene of Gnostic worship, representing the Egyptian God Anubis\\", or that the crucified being was the god Set or Typhon- Set. In the image, Alexamenos is portrayed venerating an image of the crucifix, a detail that Peter Maser believed to represent actual Christian practice of veneration of icons. This practice, however, was not known to be a part of Christian worship until the 4th or 5th century.  Notes   References   Sources  * Schiller, Gertrud.

Megas in Folktales of Greece.Georgios A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 It is Aarne-Thompson type 403A, The Wishes. Synopsis A brother and sister were poor. Once, when work let the brother buy some sardines, he gave them to his sister to keep for their evening meal. Later, three women came to their house and asked to rest. And the sister let them in and gave them the sardines. And the women told her that when she combed her hair, pearls would fall from it; when she washed her hands, the basin would fill with fish; when she dried her hands, the towel would fill with flowers. Thus, was she able to give her brother mullet rather than sardines. He demanded to know how she had gotten it, but was pleased once she told him. So he went to sell the pearls, but he was hauled before the king because it was believed that he had stolen the pearls. So he told the king his story, and the king resolved to marry his sister. The brother went back to get his sister. And when they were aboard the ship, they met a gypsy; the sister told her what they were doing, and the gypsy turned her into a bird, by sticking a pin in her head, to take her place, but she could do none of the things that the sister could do. The king was enraged; he threw the brother into prison and sent the gypsy to mind the turkeys. The sister, as a bird, flew into the king's garden and sang of her story. The next day, the king set cages to catch her. Once she was caught, he stroked her, found the pin, and pulled it out. The sister took her own form and showed that she could do what her brother had said. The king freed her brother, married her, and had the gypsy torn to pieces.

Origins The ABA was formed in 1932 by black tennis players at Buckroe Beach, Virginia; at the time, blacks were excluded from most bridge events. The desire to compete in the sport of tennis despite the racial barriers of the time resulted in the creation of the American Tennis Association in 1916. The Association often held its matches on college campuses such as Hampton Institute, now Hampton University, and Lincoln University, where adequate facilities were available. One such championship event was held at Hampton in the year, 1932. At the conclusion of the tournament, a group of tennis players, who were also bridge enthusiasts, suggested having a duplicate bridge match in the evening as a form of relaxation. This event, coupled with impetus from the Cromwell School of Contract Bridge in New York City, marked the beginning of the American Bridge Association. Dr. M.E. DuBisette became the first president of the ABA and the first National Bridge Tournament was held in Buckroe Beach, Virginia in 1933. Growth Growth was imminent for the newly formed ABA. In 1936, the ABA merged with the Eastern Bridge League, a group of New York City bridge clubs. Since this time the ABA has evolved into eight sections - Eastern, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Southern, Southwestern, Midwestern, Western, and Northwestern. As the ABA continued to grow, attention focused on the need for a permanent home. The ideal of a permanent location was accomplished when a building, which now houses the ABA National Office and ABA memorabilia, was purchased in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994. In the 1980s, the American Bridge Association selected the Schomburg Center in New York City to officially house its memorabilia. The ABA National Headquarters showcases artifacts and catalogs ABA documents. In 2005, the American Bridge Association published Defining Moments, a historical package which includes a written chronicle, DVD of oral history, and playing cards. These components depict the movements, forces, and people who helped shape the history of the ABA. The entire package or its components may be obtained from the ABA National Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1967, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) removed the final obstacle to ACBL membership for African-Americans when it included in its by-laws a rule that no person could be denied membership because of race, color, or creed.Bridge Guys website on ABA history Historically, many states, particularly in the South, had laws that made card-playing between blacks and whites illegal. Some of those were: Texas,Texas had a law banning interracial card-playing. Tennessee,Tennessee had a law banning interracial card-playing. Mississippi,Mississippi had a law banning interracial card- playing.

It was first approved and indicated for use in treating thalassaemia major in 1994 and had been licensed for use in the European Union and in Asia for many years while awaiting approval in Canada and in the United States. On October 14, 2011, it was approved for use in the US under the FDA's accelerated approval program. The most common side effects include red-brown urine (showing that iron is being removed through the urine), nausea (feeling sick), abdominal pain (stomach ache) and vomiting. Text was copied from this source which is © European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Less common but more serious side effects are agranulocytosis (very low levels of granulocytes, a type of white blood cell) and neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that fights infections).  Medical uses  Deferiprone monotherapy is indicated in the European Union for the treatment of iron overload in those with thalassaemia major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. Deferiprone in combination with another chelator is indicated in the European Union in those with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life- threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or intensive correction. Controversy Deferiprone was at the center of a protracted struggle between Nancy Olivieri, a Canadian haematologist and researcher, and the Hospital for Sick Children and the pharmaceutical company Apotex, that started in 1996, and delayed approval of the drug in North America. Olivieri's data suggested deferiprone leads to progressive hepatic fibrosis.  History  Deferiprone was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 1999. It was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2011. Generic versions were approved in August 2019. The safety and effectiveness of deferiprone is based on an analysis of data from twelve clinical studies in 236 participants. Participants in the study did not respond to prior iron chelation therapy. Deferiprone was considered a successful treatment for participants who experienced at least a 20 percent decrease in serum ferritin, a protein that stores iron in the body for later use.

AFL career Easily identifiable on the field due to his flowing black hair and determined aggression, Alvin was recruited by Carlton from the Bairnsdale Football Club in the Latrobe Valley Football League. He was among a host of Carlton players making their senior Victorian Football League (VFL) debut in round 1 of the 1984 VFL season against North Melbourne at Waverley Park. Other players making their debut alongside Alvin included Wayne Blackwell, Warren Ralph, David Honybun and Fraser Murphy. In his second season, he was named in the Victorian squad for the state of origin game against South Australia, before making his debut for Victoria against Western Australia. Alvin started his career at the Blues as a defensive half-back flanker, however when Robert Walls replaced David Parkin as coach at the start of the 1986 season, Alvin was promoted into a midfield role. Alvin had one of his best seasons in the AFL, with the Blues making it to the Grand Final (losing to Hawthorn by 42 points) and being selected to play State of Origin for Victoria. In 1987 Carlton had an outstanding season, losing only four matches by a combined total of 56 points. Carlton finished the season one game clear of second placed Hawthorn, thereby earning a week's rest before the second semi-final. After a tight struggle, the Blues beat the Hawks in the second semi-final to move straight into the Grand Final. After a tight, bruising first quarter, Carlton ran away with the game, eventually winning by 33 points. Alvin was one of the best Blues afield, completely outclassing Hawthorn champion Gary Buckenara. Alvin played with the Blues until the end of the 1994 season, when he retired after 218 games. He stayed in the game for a couple of years, captain-coaching Sandringham in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1995 and 1996. In 1999 Alvin was inducted into the Carlton Football Club Hall of Fame in recognition of his achievements with the club.

The tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the amount which the Victims Compensation Fund of New South Wales would pay to a victim of crime. This tribunal was unique in Australia in that it did not notify nominated defendants of tribunal hearings and therefore did not hear evidence that may exist from such persons. The tribunal's functions were merged into the Administrative Decisions Tribunal of New South Wales in June 2013; which in turn was merged into the newly established New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal, with effect from 1 January 2014.  Background to the establishment of the tribunal  Prior to the establishment of the tribunal, there were two ways victims could obtain compensation for personal injury: # They could sue at common law for injuries sustained as the result of a criminal act. All courts which have civil jurisdiction, such as the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the District Court of New South Wales, or the Local Court of New South Wales can hear and determine a claim for personal injury. Under this method both victims and defendants are required to give oral evidence and be cross-examined in order to assess their individual veracity and the true worth of their claim. Strict rules of evidence apply and the claim must be proven on the civil standard, the balance of probabilities; or, # Section 437 of the Crimes Act 1900 also allowed a criminal court to make an order for criminal injuries compensation. Under this method Trial Judges who had heard all the evidence during the criminal trial would then turn their mind to the question of compensation. When an order was made, the Director- General of the Department of the Attorney General and of Justice was empowered to make a payment out of government funds to the victim. The Crimes Act also provided that the Attorney General could take steps to recover any payment made from the criminal concerned.  The first tribunal  In 1987, despite objections from the Liberal State Opposition, New South Wales Labor Premier Barrie Unsworth repealed Section 437. In its place, the Victims Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) was passed then given assent on 16 December 1987 to establish a new compensation tribunal for victims. It provided that a magistrate of the Local Court of New South Wales could constitute the tribunal. The first tribunal ceased to exist when the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 commenced. The latter act continued the existence of the old tribunal under the new act. The primary change was the shift to a tariff approach of awarding compensation for injury, replacing the previous discretionary approach. The new scheme appended a schedule listing a range of body party and particular harms to those body party, specifying amounts for each injury depending on their perceived seriousness. The revamped scheme also introduced an approved counseling scheme providing 20 hours of free counseling to victims. The first tribunal differed to the way the tribunal now works. Applications for compensation were determined by a magistrate. An appeal from the magistrate could be made to the District Court.  The former tribunal  = Structure = The Victims Compensation Tribunal ('VCT') was constituted under section 59 of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 (NSW).. It came into existence on 2 April 1997, although transitional arrangements in the act provided that the VCT was a continuation of the former tribunal. A magistrate could be appointed as a member of the VCT. One of the members could be appointed by the Governor of New South Wales as the Chairperson of the VCT. Assessors could also be appointed by the Director-General of the Attorney General's Department to determine applications. = Procedure = A person who claimed to be a victim of crime could make an application for victims compensation to the VCT. Potential recipients of compensation were one, the primary victim; two, the secondary victim and three, family victims. Applications were to be lodged within two years of the alleged act of violence or in the case of a family victim within two years of the death of the primary victim. An application lodged out of time could be accepted if the applicant established there were \\"good reasons to do so\\". Leave is usually given in cases of sexual assault, domestic violence or child abuse. Commonly accepted reasons for leave being granted were the age of the victim, the nature of the offence, the impact of the act of violence on the victim and various intervening acts. Simply being unaware of the scheme would not be a sufficient reason for delay. An application form could be lodged by the victim or a representative, such as a lawyer, caseworker or parent. Once the application was received, if applicable leave would be considered. The claim would then be registered and assigned a reference number. Once registered, the claimant would be invited to file supporting evidence with the VCT. The onus was on the applicant to prove on the balance of probabilities that they were victim to an act of violence, pursuant to section 5 of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 (the 1996 Act). An 'act of violence' is an offence, involving violent conduct, resulting in the death or injury of the victim. Commonly relied upon evidence would include sworn statutory declarations by the victim and/or witnesses, medical evidence such as counselling reports, hospital notes and Authorised Report Writer (ARW) reports and police evidence. ARW reports were approved to applicants who were claiming to have sustained either a moderate or severe psychological injury. The applicant would undergo an assessment with a clinical psychologist who had not previously treated them. The cost of these reports were born by the Compensation Fund as a disbursement on the claim. Costs for obtaining evidence up to a capped amount could be claimed on each application. The next phase was the listing of the application for determination. The VCT would allocate a month in which to list the claim to go before an assessor and provide a deadline for the filing of any further evidence and submissions. As the VCT did not require either the alleged victim or the nominated defendant to be brought before it, the assessor dealt with the application in chambers and made a determination on the evidence and materials that were before it. Pursuant to s.29(2) of the 1996 Act, if the VCT accepted that an act of violence had taken place on the civil standard, the balance of probabilities, and that damage had occurred, it then determined the amount of compensation that would be awarded to the victim. Amounts were determined according to the Schedule of Injuries. The Schedule was a comprehensive list of claimable injuries with either a set figure of compensation or a range. The minimum compensation payable was $7,500 and the maximum was $50,000. Although this body was given the term \\"Tribunal\\" by the then NSW Labor government, it does not adopt the adversarial method of fact finding. It has been a government \\"policy\\" since its inception in 1989 that the VCT is NOT to notify nominated defendants that an application has been made for compensation in which their name has been provided on the application form as the perpetrator. If the nominated defendant has never been brought before a criminal court, or has been charged but the charges dismissed at Committal, the VCT is not provided with any evidence that such persons may have been able to provide to suggest that an award should not be made. If the nominated defendant has been charged but is found not guilty at trial on the criminal standard, beyond a reasonable doubt, the tribunal will have access to the various court transcripts. However, the Tribunal will not have access to any other evidence that a nominated defendant may have been able to produce. Nor will the Tribunal have the opportunity to visually access the veracity of either the nominated defendant or the alleged victim as neither are required to appear before it. Unlike the normal adversarial methods adopted in common law courts found throughout Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the US and New Zealand this policy deliberately excludes evidence that could weigh against the person making the application. In a sense the VCT is \\"blind\\" to the existence of such evidence and can only make a decision on the material that is before it. Was the VCT inquisitorial in nature? Pursuant to s.65A of the \\"Act\\" an assessor may \\"make such inquiries and undertake such investigations as the assessor considers necessary\\". Given the Attorney- General's policy not to notify nominated defendants it is reasonable to assume that Tribunal assessors do not consider that nominated defendants can provide any evidence of value to the Tribunal. Such procedure has no relationship to the inquisitorial procedure adopted in civil law countries such as found in Europe in which all available evidence is provided to the Court. In France, this collected evidence is called the \\"Dosier\\". = Appeal = Pursuant to s.36 of the 1996 Act an applicant dissatisfied with a determination by an assessor may appeal to a member of the tribunal. The appeal is held in open court and should be made within three months of the initial determination, although an extension is possible under \\"exceptional circumstances\\". The applicant and his or her legal representative can attend the hearing and adduce evidence and make submissions. There is also a legal representative for the Victims Compensation Fund who appears to resist the application. The tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence and can inform itself in such manner as it thinks fit. The hearings are conducted with as little formality and legal technicality and form as the circumstances of the case permit. Without the consent of the Tribunal, publication of identifying details about witnesses, parties and nominated defendants is not permitted. As with Assessor hearings the nominated defendant is not a party to the proceedings and consequently, is not notified of the appeal. Again, any evidence that the nominated defendant may have in his or her possession to suggest that the award should not be made is not produced to the Tribunal. As with Assessor hearings the Tribunal hearing is \\"blind\\" to the potential existence of such material. At the conclusion of the hearing, the tribunal members makes a decision on the appeal. Nominated defendants also have no right under the NSW Government Information Access Act (2010), the 'NSW Privacy and Personal Information Act (1989) or the NSW Victims Charter to apply for a copy of any documents including the judgment in which their name was mentioned. = Further appeals = While an appeal to a member of the tribunal is generally final, pursuant to s.39 of the act there is a right of appeal to the District Court on a point of law. Such an appeal should be lodged within three months of the day the notice of the tribunal was served on the applicant, although further time may be allowed under 'exceptional circumstances'.  Recovery of compensation awards  = Convicted persons = Pursuant to s.46 of the present Act nominated defendants who have been convicted at Trial in the criminal courts or pleaded guilty are required to repay the compensation award to the Victims Compensation Fund. The Director may make a provisional order for restitution against the person so convicted and must cause notice of that provisional order to be served on the convicted person in accordance with the rules. Conviction includes an order under Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (formerly section 556A of the Crimes Act 1900) and (except in Part 4) an order made under section 33(1)(b)-(g) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Under the Act convicted persons have the right to appeal against a restitution order from the Tribunal to repay the State the compensation award. The notice of objection must be lodged within 28 days of receipt of the order of recovery. As with the compensation application hearings, these appeals are also heard in chambers, with the Accesor sitting on one side of the desk and the perpetrator sitting on the other side, often with no legal representation. Pursuant to s.46 of the \\"Act\\" the Tribunal may confirm a provisional order if satisfied that the defendant has been convicted of an offence arising from substantially the same facts as those constituting the act of violence in respect of which an award of statutory compensation was made. When it confirms a provisional order, the Tribunal may reduce the amount to be paid under the provisional order having regard to: :# the financial means of the defendant, and :# such other matters as are in the opinion of the Tribunal relevant to the determination. Recovery proceedings against convicted persons must be determined in accordance with the rules of evidence and in accordance with the practice and procedure of Local Courts exercising civil jurisdiction in the same way as the determination by a Local Court of an action commenced by way of an ordinary statement of claim within the meaning of the Local Court (Civil Claims) Act 1970 (section 52). An order for restitution is taken to be a judgment of the Local Court in proceedings on a statement of claim and may be enforced accordingly (section 54). Pursuant to s.56 of the \\"Act\\" the Tribunal on sufficient cause shown may set aside an order for restitution and may stay the execution of judgment pending the determination of any proceedings to set aside the order. The 1998 amendments to the Act inserted section 46A which enables the Director to issue a provisional order for restitution against a person other than the convicted person in circumstances where the person against whom a provisional order for restitution had been made under section 46 had disposed of property as part of a scheme for the purpose of avoiding a liability (whether actual or potential) under the Act. See section 49(2A) as to the confirmation of a provisional order made under section 46A. = Unconvicted persons = Statutory compensation may be paid to victims of an act of violence in circumstances where there is no identifiable offender, where the charge against the alleged offender is dismissed or found not guilty at trial. In those cases where the offender is either unidentified or criminal proceedings have resulted in acquittal or dismissal, payments of statutory compensation cannot be the subject of restitution action.  Criticism  Peter Breen, a former independent Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council and a solicitor of the NSW Supreme Court, made accusations of false applications on the tribunal in the NSW Parliament. Further complaints to this effect were made by Senator Bill Heffernan then Federal Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet, Roseanne Catt, and the late John Marsden. It was argued that as the tribunal did not provide an opportunity for the alleged perpetrator to provide evidence and did not hear the alleged victim in person it was inevitable that mistakes would be made. Breen was particularly concerned that in the case of alleged perpetrators who had been found not guilty at trial or who had never been charged, that no proper assessment of their credibility or veracity was made by the compensation assessor. This was due to the policy of Victims Services not to inform alleged perpetrators of a hearing in which their name was put forward by an alleged victim or to require alleged victims to attend the hearing for cross-examination. As alleged perpetrators were not parties to the compensation process, they are unable to provide evidence to the Tribunal that the award should not be made. In particular, Breen pointed to two inconsistent judgments concerned with claims of sexual abuse made against John Marsden. In Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited,. Justice David Levine awarded 6 million in legal costs and 0.5 million in damages to Marsden. This was a civil defamation case brought by Marsden against Channel 7 who had aired allegations of child abuse by Marsden.The programmes were Today Tonight, 13 March 1995, and Witness, 7 May 1996. During a two-year period Justice Levine heard evidence in this matter from both Marsden and the alleged victims. In relation to the evidence of one the alleged victims (\\"X\\"), Justice Levine, had this to say. \\"\\"X\\" in the end is a witness in whom I can have no confidence at all as to his veracity. He was a very fragile witness for the defendant to call, as it turned out, on the issue of justification. I do not and cannot, on his evidence, come to the conclusion that more probably than not the events the defendant asserts took place in fact took place. \\"X was an unbelievable witness\\".(Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited. \\"X\\" had not only labelled Mr Marsden a paedophile, but had also alleged he was a drug lord responsible for smuggling whole shiploads of narcotics into Australia. An Appeal to the NSW Court of Appeal by the Defendant, Channel 7 was dismissed and a cross-appeal by Mr. Marsden for increased damages was upheld.. On 27 October 2000 following the completion of evidence in the Marsden defamation action against Channel 7, but before the judgment, Judge Coorey of the NSW District Court upheld appeals from decisions of the NSW Victims Compensation Tribunal which had the previous December dismissed applications by \\"X\\" for compensation. Judge Coorey overturned a decision of Magistrate Jacqueline Milledge, sitting as the Victims Compensation Tribunal and was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that compensable acts of violence by five men, including John Marsden had taken place against \\"X\\" and awarded him a grand total of 142,835 made up of 100,000 for pain and suffering, 35,000 for economic loss and another 7,835 in costs and disbursements. Both decisions were made on the civil standard, the balance of probabilities. Unlike the Supreme Court decision, Judge Correy did not hear any evidence from either John Marsden or \\"X\\". The \\"X\\" decision was not the end of the compensation saga for the alleged victims of Marsden. Seven other \\"discredited\\" witnesses from the Supreme Court trial also made applications for Victims Compensation. Mr Paul Fraser also commenced a common law action against Mr Marsden on or about 29 May 1997. Despite being successful in overcoming the Limitations Act,. Mr Fraser later withdrew his common law action in favour of an application to the NSW Victims Compensation Tribunal. After the Tribunal turned Mr Fraser down he appealed to the NSW District Court. On 6 July 2001 Judge Taylor awarded Mr. Fraser $40,000 in victims compensation, plus $5,078 for psychiatarists' fees and $8000 in legal costs for being sexually assaulted in the 1960s. The Judge however, did NOT find that Marsden had abused anybody, in fact at no stage in the judgment was an offender or alleged offender named. \\"The word Marsden never appeared\\". Another alleged victim and discredited witness, John Pearce, informed a Lateline reporter he had lied about Marsden and wished him all the best in the future. Following the above judgment by Judge Coorey, Breen asked a series of questions of the NSW Attorney-General in relation to the NSW Victims Compensation Tribunal. A response was provided by Michael Egan for the Attorney-Genera which explained, \\"the Tribunal provides a 'non-adversarial, non-court based system' in which the onus is placed 'on the applicant to provide evidence of an act of violence and a compensable injury'. Egan further stated that \\"it is simply not the case that the allegations made by a claimant are untested\\" and quoted the evidence which the Tribunal draws upon to make its findings. \\"The legislation requires that any application for victims compensation must be in the form of a signed affidavit, medical evidence must be provided by the claimant and relevant police and court reports are independently obtained. A major consideration in determining the claim is whether the matter has been reported to the police\\". Mr. Eagan made no reference to the inconsistent judgments in the Marsden case to which Breen had alluded in his questions. On 22 November 2006 Breen made the following comments to the NSW Parliament in relation to the passing of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Amendment Bill: In 2007 Greg Smith, Member for Epping and Shadow Attorney-General in the NSW Parliament asked a series of questions to the Minister for Police. A short reply was provided by the NSW Labor Government that canvassed the current position. Smith later became Attorney-General in the NSW Coalition Government and promised an overall of the Victims Compensation Scheme.  Financial statistics  In December 1997 a Report on the \\"Long-Term financial Viability of the Tribunal\\" was completed by the Joint Select Committee on Victims Compensation, Chaired by Mr. Tony Stewart MP. In that report it was stated that: a) a total of 82.9 million was awarded in Victims Compensation for the years 1995–96 of which a total of $1.86 million was recovered from offenders. b) Outstanding debts to the Fund recorded by the Auditor General at 30 June 1996 totalled 113.9 million, with a provision for doubtful debts of 102.9 million. But as only 51.2% of all compensation awards for that year were based on a conviction, this means that 48.8% were not based on a conviction. In the Chairperson's Report for 2007/2008 [32] it was reported that: a) Applications for statutory compensation received during the review period totalled 7031. Assessors determined a total of 4013 claims for compensation. b) A total of 61 million (statutory compensation awarded by assessors and Tribunal on appeal, professional costs and disbursements) was paid. c) Pending claims have increased from 7297 to 10 241. d) In the year 2004/05, 2887 applications were dismissed in 2005/06, 2210 and, in the year under review, 1383; e) The number of appeals to the Tribunal totalled 639 and 563 were determined. There were 177 appeals pending at the close of the financial year. f) A total of 3.36 million was collected from convicted offenders during 2007/08 slightly down from the previous year in which 3.63 million was recovered. g) Since the inception of the statutory scheme in 1988, more than 41 million has been recovered from convicted offenders. In excess of 28 million of this amount has been recovered since 2000\\". h) For the year under review there was a substantial increase in applications received over the previous year – 7031, an increase of nearly 25 per cent. i) Awards for the compensable injury of domestic violence made by compensation assessors totalled 638. Domestic violence is recorded as the offence in 963 claims. There has been a steady rise in the number of claims lodged where the applicant applies for statutory compensation for the compensable injury of domestic violence. j) In the year 2007/08, compensation assessors determined 1044 claims where sexual assault was recorded as the offence. Awards were made in 722 cases. Of the 944 claims for child sexual assault lodged out of time, 142 claims were lodged where the applicant is now aged 41–50 years, 65 claims where the applicant is now 51 to 60 years and 14 claims where the applicant is over 61 years. k) In recent times there has been substantial increase in the number of multiple claims lodged by some applicants – especially where sexual assaults or domestic violence is claimed. At present approximately 1000 victims have multiple compensable claims pending, generally such claims are historic. In 2013 Howard Brown, a member of the NSW Victims Advisory Board, said the old bill has been a farce – it is 300 million in debt.  Recent developments  = The NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal = In December 2012 the NSW Liberal Government announced that it intended to create a \\"super-tribunal\\" to be called the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal\\". The NSW government commissioned a major report into the proposal. This Tribunal will incorporate the functions of twenty-three existing Tribunals, including the NSW Victims Compensation Tribunal. One of the branches of the \\"Super-Tribunal\\" will be \\"Victim Services\\". The Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 was passed by the NSW Parliament on 21 February 2013. One prominent member of the NSW Bar said: = The Victims Rights and Support Act 2013 = The Victims Rights and Support Act 2013 was passed by the NSW Parliament on 30 May 2013. This Bill abolishes the present scheme and the Victims Compensation Tribunal and establish in its place a victim's support division of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal [ADT]. In 2014 this division was transferred to the new NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Features of the new scheme include: *a statute of limitations for people claiming compensation for violence. Claims for financial assistance must be lodged within two years of the alleged incident or within two years of a child victim turning 18. An application must be made within 10 years of the act or, if the victim was a child when it occurred, within 10 years after they turn 18. Claims in relation to domestic violence must be lodged within 10 years of the incident. However, as a last minute concession made in order to pass the Bill, the government agreed to allow sexual assault complainants who allege they had been assaulted as a child to make application at any time. Also, under transitional provisions (see Retrospectivity below) claims in the backlog of more than 20,000 cases which remain unprocessed by the system (see references below) are only to be processed under the revised legislation. This can be assumed to result in the bulk dismissal of much of the backlog. *the establishment of a Commissioner of Victims Rights who will also be the chair of the Victims' Advisory Board. The commissioner will be appointed as the head of victims services in the Department of Attorney General and Justice, will oversee the Victims Support Scheme and will otherwise assist victims of crime in exercising their rights. *Rather than reducing everything to a lump sum compensation payment, the focus of the Victims Support Scheme will instead be on providing a package of practical and financial support that is tailored to victims' individual needs and provided to victims at the time they need it. The schedule of Compensable Injuries under the present scheme will be abolished and in its place will be payments that will be related to the nature of the violent act. Counseling will continue to be provided, but the rates will be increased. *the following types of support to victims will be provided: :a) 22 hours of counseling which can be extended if appropriate :b) an individually tailored package of up to $5000 to address a victim's immediate needs :c) up to 8,000 for funeral expenses incurred by family members of homicide victims :d) needs based financial assistance of up to 30,000 for victims who demonstrate economic loss to aid in their rehabilitation and recovery. :e) a lump sum payment for trauma which will vary according to the nature of the act of violence. 15,000 for a family member who was financially dependent on a homicide victim; 7,500 for a parent of a homicide victim but who was not a dependent; 10,000 for a victim of the most serious kind of sexual assault—one involving serious injury, the use of a weapon or multiple offenders, or for a victim of a series of related acts involving sexual assault, indecent assault or attempted sexual assault involving serious bodily injury; 5,000 for a victim of a less serious sexual assault, a victim of an attempted sexual assault resulting in serious injury or an assault resulting in grievous bodily harm, including the loss of a foetus, or for a victim of a series of related acts involving the physical assault of a child; and 1,500 for a victim of an indecent assault, an attempted sexual assault involving violence, a robbery involving violence or an assault not resulting in grievous bodily harm. Of importance is the fact that this financial assistance will be paid up front rather than victims having to wait for two or three years as under the current scheme.(NSW Parliament, Second Reading Speech, 7 May 2013) Retrospectivity of new law Of minor mention only in public statements so far about the new legislation is that its transitional provisions have the retrospective effect of either completely dismissing or reducing rights of claimants under the old legislation, reported in 2012 as representing °more than 4 years of claims″. As at 2 June 2013, there were 23,698 pending applications. Moving goalposts Claims which the administration has failed to process since 2009 can now be dismissed in bulk by the application of much shorter time limits introduced in the new legislation, regardless of what laws or time limits, if any, applied when the claims were originally lodged. This in large part may explain why claims are made that the new laws will speed up processing of claims. The Second Reading speech contained no apology or expression of regret to victims who were previously entitled to claims, had submitted them, had found them inordinately delayed, but are now to have those claims rejected summarily or limited in effect. Some might see this an oversight. Given the relatively recent emergence of adult victims prepared to discuss or reveal childhood abuse, often only decades after the event, it may be assumed a significant number of old claims to be dismissed will be those related to child abuse victims who have been relatively slow in coming forward. Proportionally few under-28-year-olds are likely to be involved, if any, given that it is only recently that some decades of institutional abuse have emerged, involving hundreds of cases. The relative recency of awareness and disclosure of child abuse cases is one cause cited for the fact that substantiated cases of child abuse notifications doubled throughout Australia in the years between 2001 and 2009, while raw notification figures tripled. No details appear to be available as to how \\"up front\\" payments are to be effectively processed in an area of administration which has a track record of allowing a backlog longer than 4 years to develop and remain. A complaint has been made to the UN Human Rights Commission by various women's groups against the abolition of the NSW Victims Compensation Scheme =Tribunal Procedures= Procedures for the new Victims Scheme are very similar to the old scheme. #nominated defendants (unconvicted alleged perpetrators) will continue not to be informed that an application has been made for compensation on the basis of their conduct; #nominated defendants will therefore not be permitted to provide evidence to the compensation assessors, including both documentary and oral to show that an award should not be made; #applicants (alleged victims) will continue not to be required to be cross-examined in relation to their allegations? ::These procedures are contrary to the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness which require that nominated defendants be notified of any hearing in which their name is mentioned and that they be given an opportunity to present evidence as to why an award should not be made.[Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 at 576 and 582 (per Mason J); Haoucher v Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1990] HCA 22, 169 CLR 648 at 653 (per Deane J);Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22; Annetts v McCann (1990) HCA 57 at 598 (per Mason CJ, Deanne and McHuge JJ); Ainsworth v The Criminal Justice Commission (1992) HCA 10 at 571–572 and 574–576 (per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.] This recognises the reputational interest of a person who is at risk of a finding by the Tribunal that they have committed an act of violence. Dr Ian Freckleton SC opined:Freckleton, I.

Given the extensive review that has taken place in relation to Victims Compensation and the inconsistent result in the Marsden case reviewed above, some may consider the lack of detail in relation to the procedures to be followed by the new scheme as a major oversight.

The western section is routed through Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, along the southern shore of Lake Superior, and the adjacent Lake Superior State Forest in Alger County while connecting Munising to the communities of Van Meer and Melstrand. At Grand Marais, H-58 exits the national lakeshore area and runs through town. The segment running east of Grand Marais to Deer Park in Luce County is a gravel road that connects to H-37 in Muskallonge Lake State Park. A roadway was present along parts of today's H-58 by the late 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners and connected with other roads to Grand Marais. In the 1930s, another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and to fill in the gap between Kingston Corners and Grand Marais. The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of M-94 from 1929 until it was transferred back to county control in the early 1960s. The H-58 designation was created after the county-designated highway system itself was formed in 1970. Initially, only the section from Grand Marais to Deer Park was given the number; the remainder was added in 1972. The last sections to be paved in the 20th century were completed in 1974. The National Park Service was required to build their own access road for the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the initial legislation that created the park. This requirement was rescinded by the United States Congress in 1998, and the park service was authorized to fund improvements to H-58 instead. Paving projects were completed between 2006 and 2010 so that the entire length of H-58 in Alger County is now paved; the section in Luce County is still a gravel road. Route description H-58 starts in Munising at an intersection with M-28. The highway follows the eastern end of Munising Street through the eastern side of the city by the Neenah Paper Mill, then turns northeasterly. The roadway runs outside of, and parallel to, the southern boundary of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The park visitors center, which is open year round, is located off H-58 on Sand Point Road at the west end of the park. The highway turns due east and runs through an intersection with H-13 (Connors Road). Leaving town, H-58 becomes Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road and enters the national park. East of the intersection with Carmody Road, the county road passes to the south of the Pictured Rocks Golf and Country Club before meeting the intersection with H-11 (Miners Castle Road). This latter road provides access to Miner's Castle, a natural rock formation located on the shores of Lake Superior, and the Miners Falls. Further east, H-58 meets H-15 in Van Meer, site of the Bear Trap Inn and Bar. Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road turns south along H-15, and H-58 turns northeast along Melstrand Road to the community of Melstrand. alt=Photograph of Melstrand is located outside the national lakeshore in the Lake Superior State Forest. H-58 continues through \\"burned and cut areas, meadows, maturing second growth, and the haunting sounds of silence\\" in the state forest. H-58 reenters the national lakeshore and approaches more Pictured Rocks facilities like the Hurricane River Campground. The road then travels northward towards Buck Hill, which is near the intersection with the Adams Truck Trail; at that intersection, there is a parking lot for snowmobiles. Past this point, the road is closed to vehicles during the winter months each year; snow plows do not clear the snow from the roadway, allowing it to be used as a snowmobile trail. The area on each end of the park averages around of snowfall annually, while the National Park Service says that this central section is higher. alt=Photograph showing snowmobiles using a snow-covered H-58 The road meanders through forest lands and fields as it continues northwesterly toward the Log Slide. This location gives motorists a chance to hike down to the lakeshore to see the Au Sable Point Lighthouse peeking above the trees to the east and the Grand Sable Dunes to the west. The American Motorcyclist Association said of this segment of the roadway that it is \\"so close to the beach and lake that [one] can smell it when [he] rides.\\" The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and can be accessed from the Hurricane River Campground. The roadway crosses the Hurricane River and turns southerly away from Lake Superior. H-58 turns back eastward near Grand Sable Lake, running between the north shore of the lake and the Grand Sable Dunes on the south shore of Lake Superior. At the intersection with William Hill and Newburg roads, H-58 makes a 90° curve and travels northward for about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km). The road turns back eastward next to the Sable Falls parking lot. This lot also marks the eastern end of the segment of H-58 that road crews do not plow. The roadway exits the national park and runs to the community of Grand Marais. On the edge of town is the Woodland Township Park where hikers can walk along the beach to the base of the Grand Sable Dunes that form the east end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. These dunes reach heights of up to at a 35° incline. Hikers are advised to use the access points along H-58 to get to the dunes instead of attempting the climb up the face. alt=Photograph of the completed H-58 meets M-77 in Grand Marais. This town is the location of a small harbor that was once the home of a lumber shipping port. H-58 turns south to run concurrently along M-77 for about two blocks before turning back eastward. The county road runs along the southern edge of the harbor past the township's school and out of town. The pavement ends when the road leaves Alger County for Luce County. H-58 follows a gravel roadway through the forested northwestern corner of Luce County. The roadway turns northeasterly and runs closer to Lake Superior as it approaches Deer Park. The road also carries the County Road 407 (CR 407) designation and the name Grand Marais Truck Trail. Near the Blind Sucker Flooding, a man-made reservoir, the truck trail turns south to intersect Deer Park Road. H-58 turns east on Deer Park Road and runs between Rainy and Reedy lakes to the south and Lake Superior to the north. The east end of H-58 is at an intersection with H-37 near Muskallonge Lake State Park in Deer Park, north of Newberry. Deer Park is the location of a trio of resorts and remnants of a community that once included a sawmill, hotel and store. The state park is located on the shore of Muskallonge Lake and is visited by about 71,000 people each year. History =Road origins= alt=Photograph showing equipment A county road along part of the route of H-58 was present at by at least 1927; the road ran east and northeasterly from Munising to Kingston Corners where it followed what is now Adams Trail east to M-77. A second county road ran westward from Grand Marais. By 1929, M-94 was rerouted through Alger County to follow Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road east from Munising to Van Meer and then south to Shingleton; that routing followed what is now H-58 and H-15. The section of county road between Van Meer and Melstrand was surfaced in gravel by 1936 with the remainder only an earthen road. By the end of the year, an earthen road was constructed east of Grand Marais to Deer Park. After the end of World War II, the gravel segment was extended north of Melstrand to the Buck Hill area, and the earthen road was extended between the Adams Trail and Grand Marais by way of Au Sable Point. East of Grand Marais, the roadway was improved with gravel to the county line. In late 1946 or early 1947, the first east of Grand Marais were paved; additional sections in Luce County were improved to gravel. All of the earthen road segments of what is now H-58 were improved to gravel road by the middle of 1958; the section between Van Meer and Melstrand as well as a section east of Grand Marais were paved. (Includes all changes through July 1, 1958) In the early 1960s, M-94 was moved to follow M-28 between Munising and Shingleton. The section of Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road east of the junction with Connors Road was returned to county control by the middle of 1960, and the remainder westward into Munising was turned over on November 7, 1963. In late 1961, about was paved to the west of Grand Marais. The county-designated highway system was created around October 5, 1970, and the section of H-58 was shown on state maps for the first time in 1971. Initially, only the section between Grand Marais and Deer Park was marked as part of H-58. Within two years, the remainder was marked as H-58 from Munising northeasterly to Grand Marais; between Connors and Miners Castle roads, it was also marked as a section of H-13 where the two designations ran concurrently together. In 1974, the road was paved from Melstrand north to the Buck Hill area. The H-13 concurrency was removed in 2004 when the northern segment of H-13 along Miners Castle Road was redesignated H-11. =Park service gets involved= alt=Photograph showing the The Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore was authorized on October 15, 1966, when President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the enabling legislation. The park was inaugurated on October 6, 1972, in ceremonies in Munising. The original legislation that created the park included a mandate to build an access road along Lake Superior. When the National Park Service conducted environmental studies on such a road in the mid-1990s, they decided on a road called the Beaver Basin Rim Road between Twelvemile Beach and Legion Lake. Area residents opposed the plan, preferring that the federal government instead improve the existing H-58. Representative Bart Stupak lobbied his colleagues in Congress in 1996, saying that building the new road would cost twice as much as improving the existing H-58; Stupak also introduced legislation to remove the construction mandate from the park. Because H-58 was under the jurisdiction of the county, and not the park, it was ineligible for park service funding. Appropriations legislation passed by Congress in 1998 allowed the park service to fund road improvements in the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore for county-maintained roads. Additional legislation reintroduced and sponsored by Stupak was also passed, removing the original road construction mandate from the park. On November 12, 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the legislation which cleared the last hurdles; the park service was prohibited from building that road and instead authorized to help the Alger County Road Commission (ACRC) improve H-58. In 2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users budgeted $13.3 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the paving and reconstruction project. The ACRC implemented a five-stage plan to pave the remaining sections of the road between the Melstrand area and Grand Marais utilizing National Park Service funding. Plans were put into place by July 2006 to straighten some tight curves and realign the roadway in places. The commission designed the updated road for travel speeds of \\"to maintain the nature of the road and the park setting.\\" One phase was divided into subsections to accommodate the bridge across the Hurricane River. alt=Photograph of the Funding on the paving project between Buck Hill and the boundary of the national lakeshore was held up, pending passage of a technical corrections bill by the US Senate. The original funding authorization specified that sections were being repaved; instead they were being paved for the first time or realigned. A technical corrections bill solved the legal hurdles involved. The road commission used state matching grants from the Michigan Department of Transportation to complete the financing needed to pave the roadway. Local officials received the checks to pay for the projects at a ceremony in August 2008. While the county completed a segment on their own in 2006, the 2008 projects paved segments of the roadway outside of the national lakeshore boundaries from Buck Hill northwards. Construction in 2009 and 2010 completed the roadway inside the park boundaries, including a new bridge over the Hurricane River. The final section was dedicated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on October 15, 2010, which marked the official opening to traffic. Final work was continued through the end of that month to complete the Hurricane River Bridge. Since the road was completed, traffic has increased. After paving, the new road has reduced travel times between Munising and Grand Marais from 90 to 45 minutes. Not all residents have been happy with the updated H-58; thousands of nails have been scattered along the road, and have led to flat tires on many vehicles. Police said at the time they believed it was intentional, but had no motive for the vandalism. Since the thoroughfare has re-opened, motorcyclists now frequent the highway, and a local group has named H-58 \\"one of the top five motorcycling roads in Upper Michigan\\", and it has been promoted by the American Motorcyclist Association in their guidebooks; riders enjoy the 198 curves and scenic vistas along the road.

This is the \\"Jetstream\\" from Riese und Müller. A pedelec (from pedal electric cycle) is a type of electric bicycle where the rider's pedalling is assisted by a small electric motor; thus it is a type of low-powered e-bike. However, unlike some other types of e-bikes, pedelecs are classified as conventional bicycles in many countries by road authorities rather than as a type of electric moped. Pedelecs include an electronic controller which cuts power to the motor when the rider is not pedalling or when a certain speed – usually or – is reached. Pedelecs are useful for people who ride in hilly areas or in strong headwinds. While a pedelec can be any type of bicycle, a pedelec city bike is very common. A conventional bicycle can be converted to a pedelec with the addition of the necessary parts, e.g., motor, battery, etc. Many jurisdictions classify pedelecs as bicycles as opposed to mopeds or motorcycles. More powerful e-bikes, such as the S-Pedelecs and power-on-demand e-bikes (those whose motors can provide assistance regardless of whether the rider is pedalling) are often classified as mopeds or even motorcycles with the rider thus subject to the regulations of such motor vehicles, e.g., having a license and a vehicle registration, wearing a helmet, etc.  Advantages and disadvantages  Pedelecs provide various advantages over conventional bicycles: * Mobility: People in hilly areas can cycle using a pedelec rather than having to rely on fully motorised transport (e.g., cars or motorbikes). This is particularly useful to the elderly who may no longer have the capacity for the strenuous effort that climbing demands. * Speed: Distances can be covered more quickly, as the average speed is greater while the effort can remain the same. * Effort: Alternatively, the same speeds can be reached with less effort. This means that a cyclist on a pedelec may avoid undue perspiration – particularly when going uphill or against the wind – so bicycle commuting in work clothes is less problematic, e.g., eliminating the need to change and/or shower upon getting to work. * Greater range: As the cyclist is less fatigued, and average speeds higher, greater distances become feasible. Users of pedelecs ride more often and longer distances with the same effort. The main disadvantage of the pedelec is its price, which is significantly higher than that of similar, but conventional bicycles. The other additional expenses are minor: these are the electricity recharging costs and the eventual replacement of the battery, which together have been calculated to cost a mere €0.20 - €0.40 per 100 km. Other disadvantages are higher risk of theft due to its higher value, and the pedelec's higher weight caused by the battery, motor and sturdier frame.  History  In 1989, Michael Kutter, founder of Dolphin E-bikes, designed and produced the first pedelec prototype. The first market-ready models of this kind were available in 1992 from the Swiss company Velocity under the name Dolphin. In 1994, larger numbers were produced by Yamaha under the name Power Assist. In 1995, the first Flyer in the same year founded the Swiss start-up company BKTech AG in small series by e-business (as an integral part of the start-up) to the market. The term pedelec was coined by Susanne Brüsch in her 1999 thesis Pedelecs: Vehicles of the Future ().  Pedelec market penetration  = Europe = Throughout the whole of Europe in 2011, between 900,000 and 1.24 million units were sold; this is 29% more than in 2010. It has been predicted that in 2015, 3 million e-bikes will be sold in Europe, and these will mostly be pedelecs.  Germany  there were about 600,000 pedelecs on the road in Germany. Growth has been spectacular: the year before, 310,000-340,000 pedelecs were sold in Germany and this in turn was 55% more than in 2010. In fact, in Germany sales have gone up by more than 30% every year since 2008. In comparison, there were around 70 million conventional bicycles in Germany in 2011 according to ZIV, the German Bicycle Industry Association. About 95% of all e-bikes in Germany are in fact pedelecs. ADAC, the German (auto)motive club has tested a large number of pedelecs in 2013, where about 70% of the pedelecs failed the test with a score lower than reasonable due to unsatisfactory safety and durability. = Elsewhere= Only the Chinese market for pedelecs and e-bikes is bigger than the European. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in China, more than 100 million e-bikes are on the road. The annual production in Chinese factories has increased from 58,000 (1998) to 33 million in (2011). A pedelec classification separate from an E-Bike is not known in China.  Legal status of pedelecs worldwide To really be useful, it is important for a pedelec to be legally classified as a bicycle in each country or jurisdiction rather than classified as a moped or motorcycle. Otherwise, if a pedelec is classified as a moped or motorbike then it may not be allowed in bike lanes or on bike paths; the pedelec may have to be registered; the rider may have to wear a motorcycle helmet; and/or vehicle insurance may have to be paid for. = Europe = In the European Union a pedelec does not need registration, insurance, or license plate, if it adheres to these rules: # Motor power up to 250 W (continuous) # Motor is active only when the pedals are turned # Highest speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) with motor assistance If any of these rules is not followed, the vehicle is classified as either e-bike or S-Pedelec which require a license plate and insurance, or as a motorbike which also requires a driving license.  Austria  Under Austrian law is no difference between any types of electric bicycles like such as exclusively powered by electricity without having pedals (see below, lit. d) or as hybrid powered (see below, lit. b), equal if it is power-assisted only when pedalling (pedelec but not: S-Pedelec) or without need of pedalling (commonly in Austria known as e-bikeSee for instance: E-bikes & pedelecs (in German) Website of Austrian ÖAMTC, without date.

For these, the buyer should make sure to receive a COC (certificate of conformity) from the dealer in addition to the purchase contract. Only with these documents, the fast e-bike can be registered.See for instance: Thema S-Pedelec: Eure Fragen, unsere Antworten (in German) Website of Austrian ÖAMTC, July 2017. Retrieved September 6, 2019: \\"S-pedelecs are electric bicycles whose engines deliver a maximum rated power of 4 kW and support pedaling up to a speed of 45 km/h. S-pedelecs are considered vehicles of the class L1e-B, thus legally equivalent to a moped. To be able to steer such a thing, ergo also requires a suitable handlebar permission (at least so the driving license class AM).\\" — \\"And for a normal pedelec then a power limit of max. 600 watts for the engine. More importantly though, this engine is only allowed to assist at speeds up to 25 km / h. These normal pedelecs are therefore also considered a bicycle.\\" Other of above described electric bicycles are not typable in Austria.  The Netherlands  The true Pedelecs are not required to have any other prerequisities than a bicycle has. However, any pedelec where the power assistance is triggered by merely turning wheels rather than pedal motion (a large number of cheap versions or notoriously front hub assistance), are required to have a licence plate for a scooter / small motorcycle (so called snorfiets or bromfiets), a valid driving licence and an insurance. In case of the power assistance stopping at a speed up to 25 km/h, the riders are not required to carry motorcycle helmets, however, this speed limit shall not be exceeded even while pedaling only. There is no speedlimit by law for human powered vehicles, including un- assisted pedelecs at > 25 kmh speed. Electric bicycles, for example Specialized Turbo, without 25 km/h speed limitation for power assistance are considered a small motorcycle and besides license plate (yellow with black letters), driving license and insurance, a motorcycle helmet must be worn at all time from the start of 2017 and onwards. Very surprisingly, a large fleet of electric bicycles and pedelecs without required power control linked to the pedaling effort can be seen on the cycling paths without any proper registration. Additionally, many users found very simple ways how to tweak their pedelecs in order to overcome the pedaling sensor, making their pedelecs without further proper vehicle registration illegal. = Asia =  Hong Kong  Pedelecs, and all kinds of mechanical assist, are regarded as \\"motor vehicles\\" and classified as motor cycles, making legal registration impossible. The Hong Kong Transport Department is currently conducting a review, with a first report expected in mid-2020.(Hong Kong Government) Examination of Estimates of Expenditure 2018-19: Regarding the \\"Consultancy Study on Enhancing the Walkability in Hong Kong\\"  Singapore  Pedelecs are allowed, when wearing a helmet, the motor output is limited to 200W and the motor cuts out by 25 km/h.  India  Electric vehicles with a motor having power less than 250W, and a maximum speed 25 km/h or lower, are not required to be registered under the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, and may be driven freely without any license/paperwork. Japan Electric-assisted bicycles are treated as human-powered bicycles, while bicycles capable of propulsion by electric power alone face additional registration and regulatory requirements as mopeds. Requirements include electric power generation by a motor that cannot be easily modified, along with a power assist mechanism that operates safely and smoothly. In December 2008, The assist ratio was updated as follow: *Under 10 km/h; 2 *10 - 24 km/h; 2 - (speed in km/h - 10) / 7 *Over 24 km/h; 0 In October 2017, only for the special case that 3 wheel bicycle that draws a cart with a device to be drawn, the ratio was updated as follow: *Under 10 km/h; 3 *10 - 24 km/h; 2 - 3 * (speed in km/h - 10) / 14 *Over 24 km/h; 0 (See Moped#Individual countries/regions) = Australia = As of 30 May 2012, Australia has an additional new electric bicycle category using the European model of a \\"Pedelec\\" as per EN15194 Standard. This means the bicycle can have a motor of 250 watts continuous rated power which must be activated only by pedalling (if above 6 km/h) and must cut out over 25 km/h. The State of Victoria is the first to amend their local road rules to accommodate this new standard as of 18 September 2012.  Technical  = Components = Pedelecs differ from an ordinary bicycle by an additional electric motor, a battery, an electronic control system for the motor as well as a sensor to detect the motion of the cranks. Most models are also equipped with a battery charge indicator and a motor power setting, either continuously or divided into support levels.  Battery  Besides the motor, the battery is the main component of pedelec technology. It is usually either a NiMH - Ni - or a lithium-ion battery. The battery capacity is up to 24 Ah at 24 or 36 V or up to 15 amp hours at 48 V. The stored energy can be up to about 800 watt hour n (Wh), but mostly about 400 Wh (2013). In ideal conditions, after a thousand charges NiCd batteries have 85% of their original capacity and are therefore considered worn. With NiMH batteries about 400 to 800 cycles are possible. The charging time depending on the type of battery is around 2 to 9 hours. The durability of the battery is dependent on other factors. As lead-acid batteries discharge they provide less power, so that full motor power is no longer achieved. The very light, more expensive lithium ion batteries are now used by most manufacturers and have a range of up to 100 kilometers with moderate pedaling and a medium capacity battery (e.g. 15 Ah). Lithium batteries do not tolerate frost and should not be charged at frosty temperatures. For safety, the chemical composition and the quality of the electronics are crucial. Especially with short circuit and over voltage, lithium-ion batteries react very strongly. These problems in laptops have led to recalls. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are a notable exception. They have far safer thermal characteristics as well as being non-toxic. In evaluating pedelec batteries, it is useful to consider not only the capacity, but also criteria such as durability, memory effect, charging time, weight, safety and environmental protection. Manufacturers which equip their pedelecs with NiCd batteries usually deliver them with an AC adapter that discharges the battery completely before the actual charging process in order to decrease the memory effect. NiMH batteries have a much lower memory effect. With lithium-ion batteries there is no memory effect. A lithium iron phosphate battery is much longer-lived than a lithium-ion battery. Its use significantly reduces operating costs resulting from battery wear. In 2013, they are not yet available as standard in most pedelec models, but some pedelecs (e.g. Beyond Oil) have begun installing LFP batteries as standard.  Motor control  For switching or control of the motor, there are several possibilities: * Measuring the force or torque on the signal of a force sensors on the pedals, the pedal crank, the chain or at the wheel * Measurement of treading on the signal from a revolution counter or threshold switches on the crank, or at another suitable location * Measurement of both force and the speed * Measurement of acceleration or drawbar force at the push trailer * Measuring electrical values in the serial hybrid (pedal generator) In addition, the speed of the vehicle are measured on the wheel, in particular, for example, to drive the motor from 25 km/h off. The measurement can be further processed mechanically or electronically and is used to control the motor on and off or to regulate a control function based on continuously. The fed power is based on the sensor data (force sensor, crank speed, ground speed) is calculated based on the chosen level of support from the motor controller. The so-called support levels, that is, how much the motor supported in addition to the driver's performance lie in horizontal drive 5-400 percent. When the motors are regularly used heavily, especially when going uphill they may heat up significantly, some have a temperature sensor in the motor winding, where if a certain temperature is reached the electronics may reduce power to the motor. Ideally the electronics disconnect the battery at a predetermined discharge voltage to prevent total discharge and to ensure sufficient supply for the operation of the lighting system. This can be done by electronics in the battery. = Force control = When running with a force sensor, the motor is automatically a certain percentage of the service provided to the driver. In many models, this proportion may be set in several stages. There are also models where the support level can be set only at the dealer to the customer. = Rotary motion detection = In the version with speed sensor (s) of the motor is automatically using a function to a set percentage of the self- applied force. Since the force required at the speed rises sharply, it can be calculated in some models without force sensor. = Sliding or traction = The slide or traction can help with Maximization of legislation to support a motor without pedaling to 6 km/h. The shift means has the advantage that you can let the bike roll alongside with motor support without pedaling or you push yourself (e.g. must, when transporting a heavy load, or so you walk up the wheel alone on a hill may be). For some models, the allowed 6 km/h can be achieved only in top gear, the other gears in the wheel rolls correspondingly slower. In any case, it allows for a faster (and more controlled physically) starting from standstill to \\"green\\" switches over light n  Power Electronics  The power electronics, depending on the type of motor, consist of a DC motor controller with pulse width modulation or a regulated DC-AC converter.  Motor types  Pedelec hub motor with gearbox. Smart e-bike motor Almost exclusively, pedelecs use DC motors, using commutator-less and brush disc motors, which are suitable for direct drive, and brush motors with gears. The use of maintenance-free AC induction motors pedelec is the exception. A direct rotor hub motor may feature a regenerative brake, so it can be used as a brake that converts some of the kinetic energy into battery charge. In addition to charging the battery when braking this incurs less wear on the traditional brake, reducing braking noises.  Force approach of the electric drive  See generally starting points of the electric drive. When Pedelec specifically, the type of control of the drive by the pedaling (see above), which may be integrated in the drive.  Drive positions  The position of the motor has a significant impact on the handling of the pedelec. The following combinations of actuator position and motor have been successful: * Motor in the bottom bracket (mid-engine layout) * Motor in the hub of the front wheel * Motor in the hub of the rear wheel = Range = Generally the range with motor support is between 7 km for a constant rise and up to 70 km. At medium power addition, it is about 20 to 50 km. On some models, by default two successive switchable batteries are housed in luggage bags, here is the range specified at medium power addition of 100 km. A conventional battery (36 V / 7 Ah) (1.9 to 5.1 kg mass in a pedelec) has an energy content of around 250 Wh (1 kg of gasoline has about 11,500 Wh). The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical work is done with some loss of energy due to the generation of heat. Typically, incurred losses are around 25 percent, depending on the efficiency of the motor and the motor controller. Thus, a pedelec with a 70 kg rider (total mass of ~100 kg) can be calculated to go about 5.6 kilometres on a 10% grade at 25 km/h on battery power alone (assuming Frontal area = 0.4 meter-squared, Drag coefficient = 0.7, Altitude = 100m, Wind speed = 10 km/h and Rolling resistance coefficient = 0.007). Depending on the assistance of the rider (which is required on a pedelec), a proportionally greater range is possible. = Safety = Safety issues are a concern in relatively flat areas, but are more pronounced in the hills. Hilly areas provide changing conditions; this poses the possibility of encountering more critical situations and thus more accidents may occur. Cars may need to overtake pedelecs at higher speeds than cars would overtake regular bikes, and this may result in more accidents with serious consequences for both cyclists and drivers. For drivers and pedestrians, it may be difficult to estimate how fast a cyclist is moving. Also, an elderly on a pedelec may ride much faster than previously possible. Risky situations can also arise at exits and junctions. To illustrate the consequences of such critical situations, the German Insurers Accident Research (UDV) has conducted a research project with road tests, performance tests and crash tests for pedelecs. On the other hand, many pedelec (and e-bike) users report that they can ride more defensively with the auxiliary electric drive assisting them; unlike traditional bicyclists that tend to be averse to braking since this incurs effort to accelerate again, a pedelec rider can brake and then accelerate back to a normal speed with much less effort. The Bavarian accident statistics for the first half of 2012 lists 6,186 accidents involving bicycles, of which 76 are e-bikes and notes that the accident risk of e-bikes is not higher than for other bicycles. The use of S-Pedelecs involves an additional risk. Not only do they achieve a higher average speed, but a higher top speed (usually 45 km/h) and can also expect a higher annual mileage.

The group is an offshoot of the Ḥurūfī movement, from which Pasīkhānī was expelled for arrogance. The group first arose in Anjudan near Kashan an area known for its Nizārī Ismā'īlī Shia Islam. The group attempted to proclaim Shah Tahmasp as Mahdi after Pasīkhānī died.  Doctrines  Pasīkhānī never married and encouraged celibacy among his followers saying that the celibate have reached the rank of wāḥid, which has the numerical value of nineteen. The Nuqtavis placed an exceptionally heavy emphasis on the number nineteen. They also advanced a cyclical view of time, which is reminiscent of the Ismā'īlī. The Nuqtavis held that the total length of the Earth's existence is 64,000 years and that this is divided into four periods of 16,000 years and these in turn are subdivided into two sections of 8,000 years, one an Arab epoch and the other a Persian epoch.  Intellectual influences  The Nuqtavis owe most of their doctrines to the ḥurūfis. Most obviously the personal link between Pasīkhānī and Fażlallah Astarabādī (d.1394), founder of the Ḥurūfī movement. The notable influences were the obsession with the numerical and phonemic meanings of the letters of the Persian-Arabic alphabet. Likewise Astarabādī had proclaimed himself Mahdi as well as Jesus returned. Like many of the Muslim splinter groups in Iran, the Ḥurūfiyyah believed that Fażlallah Astarabādī's Javedanname abrogated previous revelation (i.e. the Qur'an).  Modern influences  The writings of Siyyid \`Alí Muḥammad Shírází, known as the Báb, contained many codified chronograms, cabalistic interpretations, talismanic figures, astrological tables, and numerical calculations, some of which appear to be similar to the Nuqtavi cabalistic symbolism. ‘Alĩ Muḥammad Nāżim ash-Sharī‘ah claims that the Báb was taught the Nuqtavi doctrines while imprisoned in Máh-Kú and that he incorporated them directly into his Bayán. Saiedi states, however, that while some elements found in the Nuqtavi school are confirmed in the writings of the Báb (Nuqta-yi Ula), the literal emphasis that the Nuqtavi school placed on letters as direct elements of divine creation are foreign to the Báb's teachings; his teachings have little to do with the issue of the actual letters or their literal divine character, but instead, concern a mystical world view where the sacred character of human beings is the image of God.

Ferris Faculty Association, 500 U.S. 507 (1991), deals with First Amendment rights and unions in public employment.. Background Due to collective bargaining laws in some states (in this case, Michigan), employees in the public sector (in this case Ferris State University) are often required to either join a union or pay a \\"service fee\\" to a union (in this case, the Ferris Faculty Association, Michigan Education Association, and National Education Association) for the collective bargaining services. This case pertains to the usage and collection of union dues in the form of \\"service fees\\" from dissenting nonmember employees. The Plaintiffs argued that their required \\"services fees\\" are not going toward collective bargaining, but rather toward other union activities with which they disagree (such as political lobbying), and thus the compulsory fees are a violation of their freedom of speech rights. The defendant union argued that their non-bargaining activities are \\"designed to influence the public employer's position at the bargaining table,\\" and therefore that they benefit the collective bargaining process. Opinion of the Court In a majority opinion by Justice Blackmun, the Court found that unions may compel contributions from nonmembers only for the costs of performing its duties as exclusive bargaining agent. The Court found largely for the Plaintiff, but also continued to uphold the compulsory \\"service fee\\" itself and affirmed some of the questioned uses of the \\"service fee.\\" In general, freedom of speech rights are found to limit what \\"service fees\\" may be used for. The Court ruled that the majority of the \\"service fees\\" collected in this case were used unconstitutionally. Also, the court now requires unions to provide an audited accounting report of their \\"service fee\\" spending to fee-paying nonmembers. This case provides broad clarification on the subject of required union fees in the public sector. It strikes down a previously used three-part test in favor of a more practical one-part test. This new test dictates that: \\"a union may constitutionally compel contributions from dissenting nonmembers in an agency shop only for the costs of performing the union's statutory duties as exclusive bargaining agent.\\" However, much leeway and uncertainty still exists regarding the acceptable use of union \\"service fees\\" in the public sector. =Allowed uses of union \\"service fees\\"= The court found that \\"a union may constitutionally compel contributions from dissenting nonmembers in an agency shop only for the costs of performing the union's statutory duties as exclusive bargaining agent.\\" These costs include: * Expenses directly related to the collective bargaining process. * \\"Program expenditures\\" of the national union, even those destined for other states. * Certain sections of the state union’s newsletter. These sections must deal directly with collective bargaining, professional development, education, unemployment, and other non-political topics which \\"benefit all.\\" * Participation by the local delegates in the state and national conventions which are likely to have some benefit to collective bargaining. * All expenses associated with preparation for, and negotiation of strikes. =Illegal uses of union \\"service fees\\"= The court also found that \\"certain other of the union activities at issue may not constitutionally be supported through objecting employees' funds.\\" These disallowed costs include: * Lobbying, electoral, or other union political activities outside the scope of contract negotiations, which \\"would compel dissenters to engage in core political speech with which they disagree.\\" * Union activities which serve to secure state, local, or national funds for education and sections of the newsletter which report on these issues. * Litigation which does not directly relate to the collective bargaining process and union literature which reports on this. * Public relations efforts which seek to enhance the reputation of the teaching profession and expenses related to information picketing, media exposure, signs, posters, and buttons. =Rationale= The following cases were cited in the majority opinion: *Machinists v. Street (1961), states that \\"a union may constitutionally compel contributions from dissenting nonmembers in an agency shop only for the costs of performing the union's statutory duties as exclusive bargaining agent.\\" *Abood v. Detroit Board of Education (1977), upholds the constitutionality of compulsory \\"service fees\\" for collective bargaining services. *Ellis v. Railway Clerks (1984), allows local unions to support their national affiliates through nonmembers \\"service fees\\" since they often provide support to the bargaining table in a variety of ways both direct and indirect.

It first appeared on their eponymous album in 1983. The lyrics were written by keyboardist Tony Banks and the music was written by the whole band. Lyrically, the song is about a burglar who breaks into a house only to find it is haunted.Tony Banks interview, The Way We Walk - Live in Concert DVD (2001) The burglar is captured by the ghosts, who force him to listen to their stories for the rest of his life. Background The piece was written at a point in Genesis' career when they were transitioning from progressive rock to a more streamlined, commercial style. As such, it combines simple pop hooks with an extended section more characteristic of progressive rock into one two-part piece. Played together, \\"Home by the Sea\\" and \\"Second Home by the Sea\\" are over eleven minutes long. In an interview, Phil Collins noted the track as an example of how the band often recorded songs without playing together as a group. Using a prerecorded drum machine as initial background, the band members would first produce 'guide' parts (such as vocal or guitar) to settle on the format of the song, and later rerecord them for final compilation into the song, adding 'real' drum parts as well.Interview with Phil Collins (from Hitmen, 1986 Part Two.

The school is in the Oak Harbor School District #201. Nathan Salisbury is the Principal. Nathaniel Shepherd and Arnie Otterbeck are the Associate Principals. History Oak Harbor's first high school was housed in a building on the waterfront, where the upstairs was used both as a school room and as a community hall for social functions. In the lower story, hay and freight were stored as they came off the steamers of the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet. In 1911 a new school was built on property donated by Will Izett, where, until 2006, the old Memorial Stadium stood. The high school students used the basement and lower floor, and the elementary grades were housed on the top floor. Only the basement of this building remains and is now used to house maintenance services. In 1934 with the aid of WPA labor, a school was built to house secondary students. This brick building (still in use as the North wing of Oak Harbor Elementary School) was a great source of pride to the community and housed high school students until 1956. In 1956 another new high school was completed and initially contained 330 students in grades 9-12 and an eighteen-member staff. This building (which later was used as Oak Harbor Junior High School and then as North Whidbey Middle School) contained the high school program until June 1974 at which time the enrollment was 975 students in grades 10-12. (This building was demolished in 2006.) In 1968 planning for the current high school began. It was to be located on a site near 800 Avenue West (now called NW Second Avenue) and Heller Road. It was built to house 1200 students initially and be expandable to accommodate an enrollment of 1800 student grades 10-12\\\\. The facility was built with a brick exterior, steel frame throughout except for the field house dome which consists of laminated wood beams and a wood roof deck. This facility was completed in 1975. In 1991, the school was expanded to include ninth grade, reaching a capacity of 1,700 students. By 2006 the school was at the end of its planned life, meaning that the infrastructure - plumbing and roof - were considered worn out or outdated to the point of being costly. In addition, the school was not well-suited for modern technology and undersized for the number of students (classrooms were too few and too small, and the hallways were too narrow). On May 16, 2006, voters approved a plan to modernize the high school. Designed by NAC Architecture, the project was phased and completed in September 2010. The redesigned campus focused on bringing daylight to all classrooms, widening corridors, updating technology and consolidating the school into three buildings. School information The United States Navy Band Northwest (NBNW) Big Band plays at a concert held in Parker Hall. The current high school facility, initially constructed during the 1970s, rests on in northwest Oak Harbor. The school was remodeled with the addition of the Student Union Building and the Career & Tech building opening in 2009. In 2008, North Campus was opened in the old Clover Valley Elementary School. Students in grades 9 and 10 had their core classes at North Campus and were then bussed back to the main campus for lunch, electives, and lab sciences. =A-Wing= * Administrative Offices * Counseling/Career Center * Library/Media Center * Computer Lab Departments * English * Social Studies * Special Education =B-Wing= Departments * Math * Science * Special Education =C-Wing and D-Wing= * Technician's offices * Computer services * Electronic workers =Career & Tech Building (CAT)= Departments * Art * Pottery * CAD * Metal Design * Video Productions * Photography * Graphics Design * Automotive =Gym and field house= Departments * Physical Education * NJROTC =Student Union Building (SUB)= Departments * DECA * Leadership * Drama * Cafeteria * Band/Choir * Health Academics Oak Harbor High School offers Advanced Placement courses in Art, Calculus, Statistics, US History, Government, Biology, Economics, Spanish, Literature and Composition, Language and Composition, and Chemistry.

Cable channel Available to most Comcast Cable subscribers on Whidbey Island, Wildcat TV (Channel 21) is Oak Harbor High School's student- run Public-access television cable TV channel. Operational since 2005, it features programs ranging in topic from the Island County Fair to Drama Club theatrical performances. Students in Chris Douthitt's Video Productions and Broadcast Communications classes create content for the channel. Sports Wildcat Memorial Stadium under construction Construction progress in early May The old Memorial Stadium on Whidbey Avenue OHHS is a member of the Western Interscholastic Conference and plays within the 3A division. =Wildcat Memorial Stadium= A new stadium to replace the aged Memorial Stadium was constructed in 2007 on the west end of the OHHS campus. The new stadium, dubbed \\"Wildcat Memorial Stadium,\\" had its grand opening on September 7, 2007, eight months after construction began in January. The Wildcat Memorial Stadium was built by Ebenal General Contractors of Bellingham. The facility has a covered main grandstand with 2,500 home seats and a smaller covered grandstand with 500 visitor seats. The playing field is a FieldTurf surface and is encircled by a track and field oval. The stadium includes locker rooms, bathrooms, a concession area, and storage space. The entrance to the stadium has a memorial to veterans of the five branches of the military. The main spire is a pentangle with the seals of the Navy, Army, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard mounted on the five sides. At the top, as a tribute to the active Navy personnel stationed at NAS Whidbey, there is a ship's bell. The bell is rung on special occasions and after every Wildcat touchdown. The memorial was designed by Carlos Sierra of Sierra-Martin Architects. =Football= Oak Harbor High School football achieved great success during the 1977-78 season during its first year in the WESCO Conference.

It was established by Stephen Báthory, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, in 1581 as the counterpart to the Crown Tribunal of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, established in 1578. The judges were elected from local nobles furthering nobility's Golden Liberty. The Tribunal ceased to exist after the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. Palace of the Lithuanian Tribunal was demolished in December 1836 – April 1837. Establishment After the legal reforms of 1563–64, members of the Lithuanian nobility received the right to appeal to the Grand Duke. However, soon Grand Duke's court was severely backlogged and became clear that reforms are needed. The nobles themselves demanded a \\"supreme court\\". The Tribunal was officially established on March 1, 1581; its first session was held on April 30, 1582. In effect, the reform established separation of powers in the state: Grand Duke was the executive branch, Seimas was the legislative, and the Tribunal and lower courts were the judicial.Stankevič (2013), p. 5 Proceedings Book of the Tribunal, 1586 The Tribunal charter had 20 articles governing its proceedings. The unpaid judges were elected in local nobility gatherings (sejmiks) for one-year term around February 2. Initially, the judges could be reelected only after two years, but in 1611 that was changed to four years.Stankevič (2013), p. 90 No special legal education or knowledge was required. Each voivodeship and powiat provided two people for a total of 42–49 judges. The cases were decided by a simple majority. The Tribunal had jurisdiction over the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Duchy of Samogitia, which had a privilege to establish its own tribunal, opted to join the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1588). It could not decide cases involving peasants, city residents, clergy, or Jews. The Tribunal accepted civil and criminal cases. Later its competency was expanded to include military and tax appeals and cases involving misconduct of lower-tier courts. The Tribunal met four, later twice a year first in Vilnius in the Cathedral Square, but later the location was alternated between Minsk and Navahrudak. The alternating location disrupted court's work as personnel, documents, and archives had to be moved frequently. The sessions usually lasted about five months.Stankevič (2013), p. 341 The Tribunal did not have an institution that could enforce its decisions. It delegated the enforcement to lower-tier courts. Therefore, despite penalties and other punishments for disobeying its decisions, the Tribunal had little actual power and the nobles increasingly ignored it.

Illustrations were by artist . Synopsis A farmer has many children, who are all hard-working, except for his youngest, who is small and weak and only interested in drawing pictures of cats. He decides his son is not cut out to be a farmer, and sends him to a temple to study with a priest. The boy spends all his time drawing cats instead of studying. The priest tells him he's better suited to being an artist and should return home. As he sends him on his way, the priest warns the boy: \\"Avoid large places at night. Keep to the small.\\" Ashamed of being dismissed, the boy decides not to return to his father's farm. Instead, he travels to another temple in the hopes he can ask for a night's shelter, not realizing all the priests living there have long-ago been driven away by a giant goblin-rat. When the boy arrives, he finds the place deserted and decides to draw cats on the walls. As he begins to feel tired, he remembers the old priest's words and climbs inside a little cabinet to go to sleep. During the night he hears horrible sounds of screaming and fighting. When morning comes and he finally climbs out, he discovers the corpse of the goblin-rat. As he wonders what could have killed it, he notices that all his cats now have blood on their mouths. He is hailed as a hero for defeating the monster, and grows up to be a famous artist - one who only draws cats. Origin \\"This tale was known from Tohoku to Chugoku and Shikoku regions under the title In his English edition, Lafcadio Hearn retold it with a thrilling ghostly touch.

History  Founded in Lugano in 1935 as the Orchestra della Radio della Svizzera italiana, it played a major role in the region's musical development, helping to establish festivals in Lugano and Ascona from the 1940s. Over the years it was directed by musical figures such as Ernest Ansermet, Igor Stravinsky, Leopold Stokowski, Sergiu Celibidache and Hermann Scherchen, and collaborated with composers such as Mascagni, Richard Strauss, Honegger, Milhaud, Martin and Hindemith, and more recently with Berio, Henze and Penderecki. Its first principal conductor Leopoldo Casella was succeeded in 1938 by Otmar Nussio from Graubünden, under whose directorship (to 1968) the orchestra gave a greatly increased number of concerts, opening the way to international engagements. From 1969 to 1991, with Marc Andreae as its principal conductor, the Orchestra della Radio Televisione della Svizzera italiana (as it was now called) consolidated its reputation, expanding its repertoire and fostering first performances of works by major living composers. In 1991 the orchestra took on its current name and began to win international recognition, performing in cities such as Vienna, Amsterdam, St Petersburg, Paris, Milan and Salzburg. In 1999 it began its close partnership with Alain Lombard, who first took over as principal conductor and then in 2005 was appointed honorary conductor. From 2008 to 2010 Mikhail Pletnev was principal guest conductor.

The first tropical cyclone in 1951, Able developed from a trough of low pressure on May 15 about 300 miles (480 km) south of Bermuda. Initially subtropical in nature, Able acquired tropical characteristics as it moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and attained hurricane status on May 17 off the coast of Florida. This made Able one of only four May Atlantic hurricanes on record. On May 22 Able reached peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) about 70 miles (115 km) off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The hurricane weakened as it turned eastward, and became an extratropical cyclone on May 23, before dissipating on the next day. Hurricane Able did not affect land significantly. In Florida, the storm dropped light precipitation, while in the Bahamas it produced winds of up to 95 mph (152 km/h). From North Carolina through New England, Able produced higher than normal tides. No casualties were reported. Meteorological history An active trough of low pressure exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, and by the following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed low pressure area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12° F (7° C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300 miles (480 km) south of Bermuda. Located under an upper- level low, the depression initially tracked briskly to the northwest, followed by a turn to the west-southwest on May 16 as the upper-level low turned southwestward. Later on the 16th, the depression approached the warmest waters of the Gulf Stream. Strong divergence from the upper-level low and a high pressure system to its northeast provided favorable conditions towards transitioning into a tropical cyclone, and late on the 16th the depression attained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The storm continued to intensify as it turned to the southwest, and early on May 17 a ship near the center reported about 55 mph (88 km/h) winds and up to 30 foot (9 m) waves while located about 125 miles (200 km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida, indicating the system transitioned into a tropical storm. The Navy reconnaissance squadron flew into the system later that day, and reported a storm of full hurricane strength moving southward. Receiving the name Able, the small hurricane turned to the southeast and to the east while passing near or over the Bahama Banks. Able subsequently turned to the northeast and later to the north, and finished executing its cyclonic loop on May 20. The hurricane continued to intensify with an eye 20 miles (32 km) in diameter, and on May 21 Reconnaissance Aircraft estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Shortly thereafter Able passed about 70 miles (110 km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and early on May 22 Able weakened from its peak intensity after turning to the east. On May 23 it deteriorated into a tropical storm while passing over cooler waters, and that night Able became an extratropical cyclone while located about 520 miles (840 km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The extratropical remnant turned to the northeast before losing its identity late on May 24. Impact and records Storm warnings were issued from Savannah, Georgia to Fort Pierce, Florida subsequent to the discovery of the hurricane. The National Weather Bureau advised all small craft to remain at port and recommended residents in the northern Bahamas to take immediate precautions. On Grand Bahama, the threat of Hurricane Able resulted in a construction crew to evacuate further inland; the crew was constructing an observation post for guiding long-range missiles from Cape Canaveral. Fishermen on dozens of boats left the open ocean for safety on two Bahamian islands, while two airplanes safely rode out the hurricane. Small craft warnings and storm warnings were later issued from North Carolina through New England. The outer rainbands of Able produced light rainfall and high seas along the Florida coastline. While moving slowly near the Bahamas, Able produced strong winds reaching 90 to 95 mph (145 to 152 km/h) at Walker Cay, and minimal hurricane force on Grand Bahama and Little Abaco Island. The hurricane produced high surf in Wilmington, North Carolina and abnormally high tides northward through New England, though no damage was reported. A ship called \\"City of Eastbourne\\" sailed through the storm and reported hurricane- force winds, along with \\"mountainous, confused seas and driving rain.\\" Able is one of only four North Atlantic hurricanes on record to exist during the month of May, the others occurring in 1889, 1908, and 1970. None of the others reached winds of more than 80 mph (130 km/h). It was described as \\"wrong way, wrong time\\", referring to its unusual motion to the southwest near the Bahamas, as well as its presence outside the normal hurricane season. Additionally, the Weather Bureau described it as a \\"freak of freaks\\".

The band's original line-up was composed of drummer Tony Blades, bassist/vocalist Kellie Lloyd and vocalist/guitarist Tim Steward. In 1995, Dean Shwereb replaced Blades on drums. Darek Mudge later joined on lead guitar from 2001 to 2005, and eventually rejoined in 2014. Screamfeeder have released seven studio albums: Flour (June 1992), Burn Out Your Name (August 1993), Fill Yourself With Music (1995), Kitten Licks (1996), Rocks on the Soul (2000), Take You Apart (2003) and Pop Guilt (2017).  History  Screamfeeder were formed in August of 1991 in Brisbane. Blades and Steward had previously been members of The Madmen, which formed in 1988 in Townsville with Bruce Gardner on guitar and vocals and Jeff Johnson on bass guitar. In 1989, Cam Hurst replaced Johnson on bass guitar and Gardner left. They released three singles and an extended play, Thunder Egg (1990), on their own label, Stone Groove. The Madmen toured Queensland numerous times, before relocating to Brisbane in 1989. When Hurst was replaced by Lloyd, the trio became Screamfeeder. Lloyd had previously made a filmclip for The Madmen, Tower.. Screamfeeder signed with Sydney-based label Survival Records and issued their debut studio album, Flour, in June 1992. One track, \\"Walking Through the Village\\", had been recorded back in June 1990 by the Madmen (with Hurst on bass guitar) at Pyramid Studios, and was co-produced by Steward and Murray Nash. The other tracks were recorded between November 1991 and the following January at Vibrafeel Studios with Mick Borkowski as producer, audio engineer and mastering engineer. The Canberra Times wrote in January 1993 that Flour \\"captured the raw sound of Screamfeeder while displaying the inherent depth, feeling and power within the music. Influences within Screamfeeder range from Swervedriver to Hüsker Dü to Bitch Magnet and beyond. The songs on the album forge a path of intense feeling, crossing the ground from sublime melodies to sonic punishment.\\" Flour was later remastered and re-released in 2014 by the Melbourne-based Poison City Records. Their second album, Burn Out Your Name, appeared in August 1993. It provided the single, \\"Fingers and Toes\\", in the same month. Pemberton Roach of AllMusic described their sound \\"it's pretty clear from the album's first song that the group has put in some serious hours listening to Hüsker Dü records. From the ringing distorto guitar to the throat-slashing, top-of-the-range Bob Mould-esque vocals, Screamfeeder has the Minnepolis trio's sound down better than anyone this side of Overwhelming Colorfast.\\" In 1995, Dean Shwereb replaced Tony Blades on the drums, and the band toured to promote Fill Yourself With Music and wrote and recorded Kitten Licks. In 2007 Steph Hughes briefly filled-in for Dean Shwereb on drums. Mike Squire played harmonica on Fill Yourself With Music and lead guitar in 1999 and 2000. Darek Mudge played lead guitar from 2001 - 2005 and intermittently from then on. Live members have also included Doug Arnott. Screamfeeder toured Europe with Screaming Tribesmen and The Chevelles in 1993, performed at the Big Day Out in 1994, 1997, 1998 and 1999 and have supported acts such as Rollins Band, Sonic Youth, Ride and Pavement. During the 1990s, indie and grunge rock increased in popularity throughout the world and Screamfeeder was part of the rise of independent Australian rock.

The Broadway production starred Calvin Levels as Calvin Jefferson, Marilyn Rockafellow as Ginny Carlsen, Nan-Lynn Nelson as Salina Jones, Pam Potillo as Georgia Jones, and Sloane Shelton as Professor Clare Block. The play depicts the travails of a professor at a second-rate college, including an unsupportive husband. Levels won a Theatre World Award and was nominated for both a Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for his performance. Rockafellow also received a Drama Desk Award nomination. On Broadway, Open Admissions received a Theatre World Award, The Dramatists Guild Hull-Warriner Award. This drama is usually cast with as a racially and ethnically mixed production and the story explores equal opportunity in college admissions. Calvin Jefferson, a sophomore at an urban college not unlike New York's City College, reads at the fifth grade level yet frequently gets Bs. He is slowly beginning to understand that it will take more than a diploma to make him competitive in the real world. It will take basic skills he lacks. Calvin begs his speech teacher, an overburdened, underpaid and under appreciated victim of the system, for help. She does try but it is likely too little, too late. Television adaptation In 1988 a television movie version of the play was made by Thom Mount's The Mount Company and Viacom using a screenplay by Lauro.

Owned by Purdue University, the airport is southwest of the central business district of Lafayette, in West Lafayette. Because of the heavy traffic generated by Purdue University and its flight programs, Purdue University Airport is one of the busiest airports in Indiana, second only to Indianapolis International Airport. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 3,778 passenger boardings in calendar year 2017, It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a general aviation airport. The facility no longer offers scheduled commercial airline service. Airline flights operated for about 50 years, then abruptly ended in the mid 2000s. Overview of Purdue Aviation Day 2017, an annual aviation show held each spring at Purdue University Airport. History Purdue University Airport was the very first university-owned airport in the United States. In 1930, inventor- industrialist David Ross (one of two people for whom Purdue's Ross–Ade Stadium is named) donated a tract of land to be used as an aeronautical education and research facility at Purdue University. The U.S. government designated Purdue University Airport as an emergency landing strip on 1 November 1930; runway 5-23 was paved later in the 1930s. Amelia Earhart prepared her airplane for her around-the-world flight attempt in Hangar 1 at the airport. Earhart was an adjunct faculty member at the time and the Lockheed Model 10 Electra she flew was purchased for her by the Purdue Research Foundation.AIAA, pp. 2–3. Hundreds of members of the U.S. Army, Navy, and War Training Service were trained at Purdue Airport during World War II, as were several commercial pilots from Latin America.Topping, p. 240. Later, the airport became the home of the first Reserve Officers' Training Corps flight program (1955).AIAA, p. 4. The original hangar, now referred to as the Niswonger Hall of Aviation Technology, still stands and is used by Purdue University's department of Aviation Technology for offices, classrooms, and laboratories. The bay that held Earhart's plane still contains aircraft; they are used by the Aeronautical Engineering Technology program for maintenance and inspection training. A large addition to the building was completed in the summer of 2009. A plaque on the building near the side entrance commemorates the airport's history. In the early 60s, runway 10-28 and a larger hangar were built to support the Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction with two DC-6 aircraft.Topping, p. 324. Purdue University Airport also had its own airline, Purdue Airlines until 1971. Originally operating DC-3 aircraft, and then a DC-6, there were later up to three McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (Series 30) aircraft based at the Airport. One CD-9 that was based at the airport was operated by Purdue Airlines on behalf of, and painted in the livery of Hugh Hefner for his Playboy jet. Evergreen International maintained a short-lived cargo operation at the Airport in the late 1970s using Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop aircraft. President Ronald Reagan and Air Force One (then a military version of a Boeing 707) visited Purdue University Airport on April 9, 1987. He later wrote a letter concerning a list of questions to the editor of the Purdue Exponent concerning his optimism about the future of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and his favorable impression of what he saw at Purdue. The airport has had four airport managers in its history. William Fletemeyer was the airport's first manager. He was succeeded by Robert Stroud who served as manager from 1980 until 2001. Betty Stansbury followed from 2001–2017.https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_790d5093-e8ea-533a-9a58-4afec514e2f4.html Adam Baxmeyer, a former employee of United Airlines at LAF, has been at the airport since October 2017.https://www.jconline.com/story/money/2017/08/29/purdue-university- airport-we-want-bring-commercial-air-service-greater-lafayette/612525001/  Airline service  From the 1950shttp://timetableimages.com/ttimages/lc1/lc5204/lc5204-3.jpg until the mid-2000s, Purdue University Airport received regularly scheduled commercial air service. The airport saw as many as 45,000 enplanements in 1979. LAF was subsidized through the Essential Air Service until June 1999, when the Department of Transportation cut funding as the airport was 61 miles from the Indianapolis International Airport.http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RH71sz1PCvIJ:www.airlineinfo.com/ostpdf38/50.pdf+&cd;=2&hl;=en&ct;=clnk≷=us Allegheny Airlines and Lake Central Airlines (both now part of American Airlines) maintained flights to Chicago O'Hare and Pittsburgh until 1975 using Convair 580's as well as BAC 111-200's. Indiana Airways, a local commuter airline, operated from November 1977 until March 1980. The small airline operated Cessna 402's as well as Piper Navajo Chieftain's to fly directly to Indianapolis, as well as to Fort Wayne and Cincinnati through Indianapolis.https://purdue-primo-prod.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo- explore/fulldisplay?docid=PURDUE_ALMA21484162850001081&context;=L&vid;=PURDUE⟨=en_US&search;_scope=everything&adaptor;=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab;=default_tab&query;=any,contains,purdue%20airport%20master%20plan&mode;=Basic Air Wisconsin offered direct flights to Chicago O'Hare and Fort Wayne from February 1971 through 1985. Fischer Brothers Aviation, which would go on to be acquired by Midway Airlines, causing it to be rebranded as 'Midway Connection,' operated flights between and LAF and the Midway International Airport from 1984 to 1989. Britt Airways operated flights to and from Purdue between 1984 and 1989. Piedmont Airlines also flew to LAF through the second half of the 1980s. Comair also briefly flew 6 daily round trip flights to Cincinnati on an EMB 110 in 1987.http://www.departedflights.com/DLCVGhub.html US Airways, which was known as US Air at the time, served LAF from 1988 to 1991. Starting in 1989, Simmons Airlines offered 6 daily round trip flights to O'Hare under the American Eagle name until 1995. Great Lakes Airlines operated daily flights to Chicago O'Hare and the Coles County Memorial Airport on a Beechcraft 1900, under the name of United Express. These flights operated from 1995 until February 2001. Northwest Airlines (via Mesaba Air) also offered service to Detroit on Saab 340s starting in 1992 until December 2002.https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_264b60b7-90bf-5986-89fb-4260c9fcd9f5.html Lastly, AmericanConnection (via Corporate Airlines) offered daily service to St. Louis on BAe Jestreams. This was the airport's last regular scheduled airline service and operated from December 2002 until February 15, 2004.https://www.purdue.edu/uns/html3month/2004/040114.Stansbury.airport.html In 2009, the airport proposed two daily round trip flights to and from Chicago O'Hare.http://airlineinfo.com/ostpdf75/363.pdf The service, which would have been operated by ExpressJet, never passed the planning phase. In August 2017, the Lafayette Journal & Courier reported that the airport was working on bringing back commercial air service.https://www.jconline.com/story/money/2017/08/29/purdue-university- airport-we-want-bring-commercial-air-service-greater-lafayette/612525001/  Facilities and aircraft  Purdue University Airport has an FAA-staffed air traffic control tower and is the second busiest tower in Indiana. The airport covers an area of 527 acres (213 ha) at an elevation of 606 feet (185 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 10/28 is 6,600 by 150 feet (2,012 x 46 m) and 5/23 is 4,225 by 100 feet (1,288 x 30 m). Runway 10 has a Category 1 ILS approach. Runways 10 and 28 are both served by GPS WAAS approaches. Additionally, a VOR-A approach is available. Runway 10 is occasionally used in a shortened configuration: aircraft land at the beginning of the runway but do not use its full length to stop. Instead, they hold short of the intersecting runway 5/23. Known as a land and hold short operation (LAHSO), this procedure is relatively common in the United States and allows both runways to be used at the same time. Pilots have the ability to reject the LAHSO clearance if they need the full runway to ensure a safe landing. Runway 23 has a displaced threshold, which shortens the runway to 3,913 ft for landing operations. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018, the airport had 109,620 aircraft operations, an average of 300 per day: 99% general aviation, 1% air taxi, and <1% military. At that time there were 82 aircraft based at this airport: 88% single-engine, 7% multi-engine, 3% jet, and 2% helicopter. FedEx donated a 727 to Purdue, which was eventually torn apart. United Airlines donated a 737, which was subsequently torn apart and given to the Department of Aviation Technology's aircraft mechanics program. In October 2014, Comair donated a Bombardier CRJ-100, which was then customized with Purdue logos near the cabin door and on the tail. The airport is also home to two medical helicopters. One of the helicopters, an EC-145, is operated by Metro Aviation, Inc. for IU Health LifeLine. The airport has one passenger terminal, which was used for air service until early 2004 and has space for two airline gates. The building was built in 1943 as hangar-2, was renovated in 1979 to provide screening for airline passengers and again in 1984, including a new entrance, concourse, and baggage claim area. It currently houses an aviation library and airport administration offices. Its functionality as an airline terminal is still regularly used for charters for Purdue Sports. A new terminal on the west side of the airfield was planned in the 1980s.https://purdue-primo-prod.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo- explore/fulldisplay?docid=PURDUE_ALMA21484162850001081&context;=L&vid;=PURDUE⟨=en_US&search;_scope=everything&adaptor;=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab;=default_tab&query;=any,contains,purdue%20airport%20master%20plan&mode;=Basic These plans were later altered to include a new terminal on the east side of the airfield in the early 2000s,https://purdue-primo- prod.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo- explore/fulldisplay?docid=PURDUE_ALMA21541282800001081&context;=L&vid;=PURDUE⟨=en_US&search;_scope=everything&adaptor;=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab;=default_tab&query;=any,contains,purdue%20airport%20master%20plan&mode;=Basic but neither of these plans ever came to fruition.

Their lyrics commonly deal with war and spirituality. They have been compared to Angelcorpse and Morbid Angel. History Abominator was formed in Melbourne in 1994 by Andrew Undertaker and Chris Volcano (formerly of Deströyer 666) and self-released their first demo, Barbarian War Worship in May 1995, which featured six tracks. It was later rereleased as a split with Swedish death metal band Mornaland. In late 1995, Dave Deathsaw (guitars) and Gary Gestapo (Bass) were added to the lineup and performed numerous gigs, including with cult black metal band Bestial Warlust. The vocalist for Bestial Warlust, Damon Bloodstorm (bass, vocals) joined Abominator about this time, and Gary Gestapo was dismissed.

History Ancient Mirzatula Mosque in the village of Mirjatula, Mirpur Union. Bahubal was a part of the Tungachhal and Rajpur kingdoms. The last Raja of Tungachhal, Achak Narayan, was defeated in 1303 during the Conquest of Taraf by Syed Nasiruddin and his 12 lascars. In the 17th century, after Khwaja Usman's departure from Bokainagar Fort, he reached Putijuri in Bahubal. Here, he built a fort at the foot of the Giripal and stationed his brothers, Malhi and Wali, and son, Mumriz in Putia Hill. The area was historically famous to be the home of fighters and people of physical strength. Famed for sports such as malla-yuddha and lathi khela. One day, a wrestler (Mal) from Dakshinbhag, Moulvibazar, came to this area to fight another wrestler by the name of Qudrat Mal in a game of malla-yuddha. Qudrat defeated the wrestler and made his famous statement, \\"Bahuka Bol Dekh, Beta\\". This phrase became famous in the local area and from Bahuka-Bol, the place eventually was shortened to Bahubal. This incident is remembered through a common folk rhyme. On 20 December 1793, Bahubal became a part of the Lashkarpur District. In 1921, Bahubal was made a thana headquarter. During the 1950 East Pakistan riots, the village of Silani was attacked at 9 A.M. on 15 February. The mob raised provocative slogans and set fire to many homes. The inhabitants fled to the nearby jungles to save their lives while the others were killed. Bahubal thana was upgraded to an upazila in 1984.

Estate of Baniachong was so vast it crisscrossed all districts of Sylhet region as well as the greater Mymensingh, Dhaka and Comilla. In accordance with the Pargana system introduced by Murshid Quli Khan in 1722, Anwar Khan claimed tenure of 28 Parganas of Muazzamabad, but his claim was rejected after an investigation by the revenue office, as these Parganas belong to the posterity of Shah Muazzam Uddin Qureshi, who assumed the name of Muazzam Khan when he ascended the throne of Muazzamabad. Hence, these 28 Parganas: Banshikunda (Vamshikunda), Ranadigha, Shelvarsh, Sukhaid, Bétaal, Palash, Laxmanshree, Chamtala, Pagla (Paragala), Dohaliya, Bazu Jatua, Sinchapaid, Shafahar (Shaharpara), Sik Sonaita (Sonauta), Atuajan (Atuajahan), Aatgaon, Kuwazpur, Joar Baniyachung, Kasba Baniyachung, Jalsuka, Bithangal, Joanshahi, Mudaikaid (Mudakadi), Kuresha, Jantari (Yantri), Haveli Sonaita, Satar Sati and Paikuda, were allotted to new landholders that created numerous zamindars and taluquedars in former Muazzamabad (districts of Sunamganj and Habiganj). The history of the battle between Anwar Khan and his brother Hussain Khan (Bara Bhuiyans of Baniachang) with the Mughal army in the first decade of the seventeenth century is found in the Baharistan-i-Gayebi. Zamindars of Banyachung was renowned for their generosity, but the last zamindar was more than generous; he was well known for his gullibility and his aged but adept and calculating servants such as dewans and chaudharies swindled him left, right and centre. By the time of the retirement, dewans and chauddharies working for Banyachung zamindar ended up holding more lands than the zamindar himself. This was achieved through a severance scheme conjured up by a shrewd dewan; this scheme made the zamindar honour-bound to grant land (taluque) to his servants on retirement and there were two categories of taluque: (i) Khalisa and (ii) Mujrahi, aka Mujrai. The first category of taluque, i.e. Khalisa, was reserved for the male servants and the second category of taluque, i.e. Mujrai, was reserved for zamindar's courtesans. This scheme ruined the zamindary of Baniyachung within a very short span of time and created numerous Khalisadar and Mujraidar in the region, who nowadays style themselves as chowdhury in Sylhet region.

Etymology Barlekha (pronounced Borlekha) was very large in comparison to other zamindaris which is why it was known as Boro-Elaka (large area). Over time, Boro-Elaka was shortened to Borlekha. History The Malegarh hillock at Lathu (came to be known later as Shahbajpur), the northern tip of Barlekha Upazila, was shaken up in November 1857 after Indian rebels revolted in Meerut. The soldiers of 34 Native Infantry in Chittagong revolted, looted the armoury and treasury and set army barracks on fire. These rebel soldiers, on their way to reach Manipur, pitched their tents at Malegarh. A force of 160 company soldiers under Major Byng, initially reached Protaphgarh (now in India) and then Malegarh on December 19, 1857. In that battle, Major Byng and four other company soldiers lost their lives. The mutineers retreated leaving behind twenty-six rebels including Major Sher Khan and Captain Shamsher Khan. For those who lived long enough to make it to Manipur, they were attacked not only by the company soldiers but also Kuki scouts. Ali Baksh of Chittagong, one of the rebels, was caught and charged of desertion, robbery and revolt. Gonjer Ali of Protapgarh and Zamindar Gous Ali Khan of nearby Prithimpasha were accused of helping the rebels. At the Delhi Durbar on 12 December 1911, King George V announced the reunification of a Bengal Province and the creation of an Assam Province. During this time, the Sylhet region was split into four (or subdivisions); Sylhet (including Moulvibazar), Habiganj, Sunamganj and Karimganj. In 1882, the Sylhet Mahakuma was split into two; Sylhet and South Sylhet. On 18 May 1940, one of the five thanas of the Karimganj Mahakuma, Jolodhup, was planned to also be split into two - Beanibazar and Barlekha. Beanibazar went to Sylhet Mahakuma while Barlekha went to South Sylhet Mahakuma. On 1 July 1983, Barlekha Thana was upgraded into an upazila. Geography Barlekha is located at . The area of the upazila is 315.58 km². Demography At the 1991 Bangladesh census, Barlekha had a population of 200,674, of whom 50.09% were aged 18 or older (against the national average of 48.52%). Of the population, 49.86% were male (national average of 51.48%) and 50.14% female (national average of 48.52%). The average literacy rate (measured as having 7+ years of education) was 34.6%, against the national average of 32.4%. 70.59% of the population are Muslim, 28.31% Hindu, 0.92% Christian, 0.04% Buddhist, and 0.14% other beliefs. Ethnic nationals include Manipuri and Khasi, who have their own languages. Manufacturing and minerals There are 18 tea gardens in Barlekha spread over an area of 64.39 km2, most of which were established by the English tea planters during the time of British Raj. Each garden has its own tea- processing factory. Tea laborers who work in the gardens were brought in the 1800s from outside of Bengal under rather questionable working conditions. Sujanagar of this upazila is known for producing incense and attar (essence of flowers and Agar tree). For over a century, these have found markets in Middle Eastern and Far Eastern countries. There are about 350-400 agar attar factories in Barlekha. Agar attar is considered as liquid gold of Bangladesh. About 2000 litres of agar attar is produced in Barlekha every year. Cottage industries include weaving, sheetalpati, bamboo and cane work, iron work, and potteries are other works of Barlekha. At Kesrigul, there is an abandoned oil field of Burma Eastern Oil Company. It was a fully functional oil field but had to be sealed off in 1951 following a disastrous oil flood when crude oil burst out of the well and flooded the surrounding area. Deposit of radioactive uranium has been discovered in Haragachha Hill at Juri, and an expert team has authenticated its reserve.  Economy and tourism  Barlekha is home to many points of interest. Madhabkunda waterfall is one of the most well-known tourist attractions in the country. It is Bangladesh's largest waterfall boasting a height of 200 ft (61m) and is set in a green Eco-park setting. Madhabkunda is surrounded by the hills full of tea plants. Every year thousands of tourists are drawn to Madhabkunda because of its natural environment, especially in winter. It is about 15 km from Barlekha railway station, and 350 km from the city of Dhaka. Geologically, this waterfall is in the Patharia Structure and is composed of the rocks of the Bhuban Formation. Local Hindus believe the circular pool where the water falls is a magical place, and many worshippers go there every year. Although the water in the pool is not very deep, several tourists have lost their lives in Madhabkunda by the force of the water. Other sites include the mausoleums of Shah Dariya Pir in Chandpur, Syed Yaqub in Horipur and Syed Abu Bakr in Chotolekha. A 16th century mosque located in Loghati, Dasher Bazar is an archaeological heritage site that continues to attract visitors. Over 40% of Hakaluki Haor, one of the largest marsh wetlands of Bangladesh as well as of Asia covering a total surface area of 181.15 km2 falls within Barlekha. A very large number of nature tourists come to visit the haor each year. Hakaluki Haor represents a complex wetland system with more than 80 interconnecting beels in a shallow basin formed between the Patharia and Madhab Hills to the east and the Bhatera Hills to the west. The major sources of water are the Juri, Sonai Bardhal and Kushiyara rivers, which traverse the wetland and drain through a single outlet, the Kushiyara River. While the haor itself is a seasonal water body formed during the monsoon, the beels are low-lying depressions of the haor system retaining water even during the dry months of the season. Thus, the haor system is a complex of both lacustrine wetlands (with open water) and palustrine wetlands (marshy – with vegetation), depending on the hydraulic behaviour in different seasons. In rainy season it takes the shape of a sea. Hakaluki Haor has a wide variety of waterfowl as well as wintering migratory birds.http://umanitoba.ca/outreach/begcb/pub/presentations/27739254-Environmental- governance-in-Hakaluki-Haor-Bangladesh.pdf Every winter, tens of thousands of guest birds of about 150 species from Siberia and other cold regions flock to the haors. They include Bright and Rose King-duck, Pati-duck, Bali Hash, Lenja, Chity, Sorali, Boikal, Nilshir Piyan, Pantamukhi, Pankouri, Buti-duck, China, Rangamuri, Black-duck, Peributhi, Chokachoki, Giria, Khonjona, Patari, Dolpipi, Water-hen, North-Giria, Dahuk, Patibatan, Common-chill, Cotton-Chill, Gergini, Cottontail, Pintail, Toughed Duck. Hakaluki Haor presents a unique type of ecosystem as well as a new set of management issues. Most of the local inhabitants are in some way dependent on the wetland for their livelihood. Hakaluki Haor supports one of the largest inland fisheries in Bangladesh. It is one of the so-called ‘mother fishery areas’, i.e. areas where brood, young and juvenile fish aggregate and take refuge during the dry season when the rest of the haor area becomes dry. While the area was once known as a \\"fishmine\\", its fish stocks are now increasingly threatened. Hakaluki Haor is on a global level a very important wetland for a wide variety of waterfowl, particularly Anatidae ducks. In the 1960s, the wintering population of ducks was estimated at between 40,000 and 60,000.Every year a lot of birds making their nest in the house of Late Haji Monuhor Ali Master's house. This house became very well known as Masterer Pakir Bari which is a popular tourist attraction to the naturalist. Everyday a lot of local and international tourists visit Masterer Pakir Bari. In Hakaluki Haor threatened species such as Pallas’ Fish Eagle also occurs at the wetland, which is furthermore an important area for reptiles such as freshwater turtles, and for amphibians.http://en.bdfish.org/2010/11/hakaluki-haor-plenteous-beauty- pompous-biodiversity/BdFISH Administration Administratively, Barlekha Upazila consists of 9 Unions and 1 Pouroshova (Municipality)/Ward that encompasses 109 Mauzas or Mahallas and 253 villages.

Alfredo came from an itinerant performing family whose origins lie with the Codoni family in the Italian speaking area of Canton Ticino in southern Switzerland. The original Codoni family name evolved around 1840 into the name Codona, which is widely recognised in Punch and Judy, circus and of fairground folklore - Codona is practically a household name in the entertainment business in Scotland where the family owns a large static fairground site in Aberdeen and other members of the family travel around the country with portable amusement rides. John Codoni (Codona) and Elizabeth Hart gave birth in 1835 to Alfredo's grandfather Henry (Enrique) Codoni, before travelling to America where a very young Enrique stayed on but the rest of the family went back to Scotland. Enrique and a young french artiste, Victorine, had two children, one of whom was Alfredo’s father Eduardo. Codona was born in Sonora, Mexico, to a circus trapeze family that became famous in the Ringling Brothers Circus. His father owned their circus and his mother, Hortense Buislay, came from a great family of trapeze performers. He began appearing in the circus at 7½ months when his father, a flyer, balanced him on his hand for the opening act. By 1913 Eduardo had formed a family act that included Alfredo, his brother Abelardo (known as Lalo), and his sister Victoria. Alfredo married his first wife, Clara Curtin (also an aerialist) in 1917 after she left her husband. They were divorced in 1927. In 1928 Codona married aerialist Lillian Leitzel, who died in 1931, aged 39, in Copenhagen, Denmark when one of her hand rings snapped and she fell to a concrete floor. Both were tempestuous, star performers whose personalities were well matched. Alfredo was famed for his triple somersault, which he regularly incorporated in his act.Culhane, J. \\"Trapeze\\" New York Times, March 19, 1978 He was the first male performer to do so.Culhane, J. \\"Trapeze\\" New York Times, March 19, 1978 Codona later married a member of their trapeze act, Vera Bruce, in 1932. He was featured in the 1932 film Swing High (which is currently available to view on YouTube) and was stunt double for Johnny Weissmuller in Tarzan the Ape Man as well as its sequel Tarzan and His Mate. Alfredo continued to incorporate extremely dangerous stunts into his act and in 1933, he suffered an injury that prevented high aerial acts in the circus and retired from the trapeze in 1934. Codona's distress about his second wife's death and inability to perform led to the deterioration of his third marriage. He committed suicide by gunshot in Long Beach, California, after shooting Vera Bruce during a division of their property in front of her horrified mother (newspaper accounts of the day incorrectly stated that Vera was his second wife).Staff report (July 31, 1937).

Etymology There was a local zamindar by the name of Kinkar Nath Ray who appointed a naib by the name of Kamal Narayan in order to develop the land. Kamal established a ganj (treasured neighbourhood) named after himself. In 1922, Kamalganj was made a thana and in 1983, an upazila. History Kamalganj was a part of the ancient Ita Kingdom founded by Raja Bhanu Narayan. The final raja of the Ita Kingdom, Raja Subid Narayan lost a battle in 1610 in which the region became under the rule of Khwaja Usman. However, this rule was short-lived after Mughal General Islam Khan I's attack in 1612. The battle between the Mughal Empire and Khwaja Usman was held in Patanushar, Kamalganj. This led to the death of Afghan leader Khwaja Usman. A peasant rebellion led by Qasim Ali, Panchanan Singh, Baikuntha Sharma and Themba Singh was also held in the 1900s in Vanubal, Kamalganj. Demographics thumb As of the 1991 Bangladesh census, Kamalganj has a population of 191,672. Males constitute 50.98% of the population, and females 49.02%.

The total area of this upazila is 545 km2. Hakaluki Haor, the largest marsh wetland in Sylhet and one of the largest in Bangladesh is partially located there. Etymology According to Tarikh-i-Halimi, Mamand Mansur, a famous Dewan of Mansur village, had an uncle called Mamantad Kulaor Kumar who was the brother of Mansur's father Mamand Manuhar. After the death of Kulaor Kumar, a market was established on the eastern part of his own zamindari and named as \\"Kulaor Bazar\\". Over time, Kulaorar Bazar changed to Kulaura. History The ancient Rabir Bazar Jame Masjid. Many archaeological sites and relics such as the Vidia Ashram in Rangirkul, Gagan Tila, Chand Gram Dighi and the copper plates of Bhatera provide evidence for early settlements in Kulaura. Following the Conquest of Sylhet in 1303, Shah Halim ad-Din of Narnaul and his son, Dawlat Shah Abdul Malik, migrated to Kanihati ruled by the King Aslam Roy of Kailashahar. Roy insisted on rewarding him some of his land, after receiving assistance in capturing a tiger. Roy and his courtiers made a decision that they would fire an arrow (teer) and wherever it lands, that land would be given to Helimuddin. This place was named Teerpasha and later became known as Tarapasha in Rajnagar. After becoming a Muslim, Roy felt that the Shah was more deserving of his kingdom and so he migrated elsewhere to seek further knowledge, leaving behind his wife, Kanak Rani Kani. Helimuddin built her a house and pond remain in existence as Kanir Bari and Kanir Pukur. Queen Kani's daughter, Princess Rajrani, grew a love for the religion of Islam, eventually becoming a Muslima, changing her name to Bibi Hamira and marrying Dawlat Malik. The Queen also became a Muslim. The descendants of this family became known as the Zamindars of Kanihati. In 1499, a Persian nobleman from Isfahan known as Prince Sakhi Salamat settled in Prithimpassa, Kulaura. Being a wealthy nobleman; his son, Ismail Khan Lodhi, was granted a jagir by the Mughals and given the status of Nawab in addition to other prestigious titles. In 1756, the Nawab of Longla Moulvi Muhammad Rabi Khan Danishmand established the famous Rabir Bazar (Rabi's Market). Begum Talib-un-Nisa Khatun of Chhoto Saheb Bari (Prithimpasha village) established the Rabir Bazar Jame Masjid. The East India Company first heavily influenced their trading of tea in Kulaura.Colleen Taylor Sen (2004). Food Culture in India. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 26. . It became an important location for tea cultivation in Bengal and major export. Local entrepreneurs also started founding their estates such as Nawab Ali Amjad Khan who established the Rungicherra (also Rungichara) Tea Estate. In the anti-British Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, 300 sepoys who revolted against the British, looted the Chittagong Treasury and took shelter with Nawab Gaus Ali Khan of Prithimpassa. The treasury remained under rebel control for several days. Abdul Ghafur, grandfather of Ali Haydar ibn Ali Gawhar, of Kanihati was present during the mutiny.Sreehatter Itibritta – Uttorangsho (A History of Sylhet), page 263-264, Achyut Charan Choudhury; Publisher: Mustafa Selim; Source publication, 2004 In 1921, the non-cooperation movement also spread to Kulaura after being established by Purnendu Kishore Sengupta in Vidia Ashram, Rangirkul. In 1939, there was an anti-British protest held in Nabin Chandra School. Many students were attacked and expelled by the British forces based in Kalapani Haor. In 1950, the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, visited Prithimpassa and stayed for four days at the palace and went wildlife hunting in the Estate forests alongside Khwaja Nazimuddin and Ayub Khan. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Kulaura was the centre of the Battle of Gazipur in Gazipur Tea Garden. The battle raged from the 4th to the 5th of December 1971 and was a prelude to the Battle of Sylhet. The Pakistani army camped in Kulaura Hospital and Nabin Chandra School and killed over 100 Bengali freedom fighters and civilians. Chiral Muchir Bari, bank of Padma Dighi of Ali Amjad High School were experienced mass killings. A graveyard in Chatolgaon hosts many martyrs.

It is 2D action-adventure game where the player controls an armored figure searching for treasure and the pieces of the stolen Gemstone. Gemstone Wariror was SSI's first game to sell over 50,000 copies in North America. The game was ported to the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family, and Macintosh. It was followed by a 1986 sequel, Gemstone Healer, also created by Paradigm. Plot The player has to recover the Gemstone, a relic of incredible power forged by the gods and focusing the natural magic of the world. This, they entrusted to Man alone and for a time, there was great prosperity and peace. But the Demons, led by Nicodemius, had managed to boil to the surface and take the Gemstone. Unable to destroy it, Nicodemius fragments it into five pieces and hide them in the Labyrinth, buried deep within the Netherworld. Going into the Netherworld, the protagonist must find and return with the Gemstone. Gameplay There are three difficulty levels, determining various factors such as the rate at which magic items change their effects and the rate at which more dangerous monsters start appearing. The game is viewed in a 2D screen displaying the playing area, health, and inventory. The player controls an armored figure that wields a crossbow with a limited supply of bolts that can be replenished by finding more within the dungeon areas. Special \\"fireballs\\" can also be launched against foes, although these are limited and are not as common. There are also magical tools and other items that can be collected to provide a variety of benefits such as goblets that can restore health to crystal balls that can annihilate everything on the screen. The dungeons are filled with a variety of dangers and secret doors. Many brutal monsters fill the caverns ranging from skeletal warriors, exploding gas plants, to nearly invulnerable demons. The player is also able to search the corpses of monsters that remain behind, chests, and coffins for supplies. Monsters do not always respawn in zones, leaving behind only their corpse as a reminder that the player had been there, although some do return to life, such as the skeletons and ghosts. The goal is to traverse the maze to locate the Labyrinth, find the five pieces of Gemstone within its randomly generated layout, and return to the entrance cavern to escape.

It is bordered by Chhatak and Dakshin Sunamganj to the north, Bishwanath and Osmani Nagar to the east, Derai to the west, and Nabiganj to the south. Etymology Jagannath is a compound of two Sanskrit words: jagat (universe) and nāth (lord), which literally means the lord of the universe, and pur means city or village. Jagannathpur means the city of the lord of the universe. History =Early history= Jagannathpur was an important part of Muazzamabad, as Kamalshahi was the capital and mint city of Muazzamabad and it was located in Shaharpara, which is in north-east of the present-day Jagannathpur Upazila proper. However, according to a ballad written by one Taranath Chaudhury, Jagannathpur was a kingdom and Vijay Manikya was its king and this king was a follower of Jagannath Mishra, who was the father of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534). Jagannath Misrah built a Basu Dev temple under the auspice of Vijay Manikya and this temple was named after Jagannath Misrah, i.e. Jagannath temple. Eventually a settlement established encircling the Jagannath temple and as the settlement grew, it became a village, which inherited the name from the temple. However, historians such as Achyut Charan Choudhury and Syed Mujtaba Ali are in opinion that Taranath Chaudhury characterised his song on Manikya Dynasty of Tripura, but the peasants and ryots of Jagannathpur found pride in that ballad and begun to misrepresent it as a royal chronicle of Jagannathpur. They also proclaim that Vijay Manikkya established a kingdom called Pandua on the eastern border of Jagannathpur, but the name of Pandua has changed to Perua, which now has shrunk to a tiny village market between Jalalpur and Habibpur. In reality, Pandua is a ruined city in Malda district of West Bengal, India, which means Pandua in Malda was the location of Taranath Chaudhury's ballad. Most probably the king Vijay Manikya (1532-1563) of Tripura or Twipra Kingdom named Jagannathpur after Jagannath Temple in Puri in the state of Odisha, India. It is believed that a disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu built a temple in Jagannathpur replicating the temple in Puri. This temple was originally named Jagannath Temple but eventually, it renamed as Basu Dev Temple. There is much more evidence that indicates Vijay Manikya was a king of Tripura and the myth of kingdom of Jagannathpur was germinated following a novella penned by one Taranath Chaudhary, who also claimed in his tale to be the last surviving offspring of Vijay Manikya.Rajmala, the Royal Chronicle of Tripura Kingdom In sixteenth-century, Jagannathpur was a zamindari (the equivalent of the medieval European serfdom) of two sisters, Shivani and Mohini, who were granted the zamindari by the sovereign of Muazzamabad. Shivani and Mohini were cheated by their Choudharies and Diwans, which led to impecuniosities and resultant non-payment of revenue collected from the serfs led to the forfeiture of zamindari. Shivani and Mohini refused to give up their zamindari and instead declared a battle against the Khans of Muazzamabad. On the order of the reigning Khan, Jagannathpur was besieged by Paragal Khan from Paragola (present-day Pagla), Syed Habib Ullah from Habibganj (present-day Habiganj) and Khawas Khan from Shaharpara. No battle ensued and the truce was declared on the condition that Kuwaz Khan and Syed Habib Ullah respectively walk down the aisle with Shivani and Mohini.Choudhury, N: History of Jagannathpur After the Conquest of Gour in 1303, many disciples of Shah Jalal migrated and settled in present-day Jagannathpur where they preached Islam to the local people. In 1315, under the spiritual leadership of Shah Kamal Qahafah, he came with his 12 spiritual disciples to Shaharpara, which on the north-eastern the boundary of Jagannathpur, and preached to the people the message of Islam. One of the disciples (Syed Shamsuddin) stayed at Syedpur. Dawar Baksh Khatib and Dilawar Bakhsh stayed in the village of Dhawrai,Feson Ullah or Shah Faizullah at the village of Fesi, Shah Shamsuddin Behari stayed village of Atghor, Shah Kala Manik stayed at the village of Maniharagow, Shah Kalu and Shah Chand stayed in Peerergaon and Chandbharang. Shah Jalaluddin at Quskipur. Geography Location of Jagannathpur in Bangladesh Jagannathpur is located at . It is bordered with Chhatak in the north, Bishwanath to the east, Osmani Nagar to the south east, Nabiganj on the south, Derai to the west and Dakshin Sunamganj in the north west. It has 28546 units of households and total area of 368.27 km². Jagannathpur is geographically divided into two distinct regions: Upper- Jagannathpur and Lower-Jagannathpur, the former comparatively consists of highland and the latter consists of lowland and Nulluar haor is the largest among the swamps. Local government offices — Union Council Office — are scattered in both upper and lower Jagannathpur. Patli, Mirpur, Asharkandi, Syedpur–Shaharpara are located on the upper region while Kalkalia, Jagannathpur, Raniganj, Pailgaon and Chilaura–Haldipur are on lowland. Before the formation of Jagannathpur thana (police station) in circa 1922 CE, upper Jagannathpur was under the jurisdiction of Rasoolganj thana and lower Jagannathpur was under the jurisdiction of Derai thana, and both Jagannathpur and Derai Upazilas were under the jurisdiction of the District of Rasoolganj. Settlements and villages have mainly founded along riverbanks and on fringe of haors. Economy Paddy field in Jagannathpur Lake of Jagannathpur Jagannathpur is regarded as the breadbasket of the District of Sunamganj; fertile paddy-fields has been providing crops in abundance, which has been the source of wealth and stability in the area and this has been further boosted by remittance from abroad. There are 14 post offices available in the area, including 12 banks. Demographics At the 1991 Bangladesh census, Jagannathpur had a population of 188,139, of whom 95,285 were aged 18 or older. Males constituted 51.13% of the population, and females 48.87%. Jagannathpur had an average literacy rate of 27.9% (7+ years), against the national average of 32.4%. Of the population Muslim accounted for 81.75%, Hindu for 18.10%, Buddhist for 0.02%, Christian for 0.01%. There are 247 mosques and 5 Hindu temples in the Upazila.Jagannathpur - History At the 2001 census, it had a population of 225,271, of whom 51.7% were male and 48.3% were female, which shows the Upazila has a balanced gender ratio. =Immigration and migration= Migration process has been constant and steady in Jagannathpur Upazila and it can be characterised as a two-way traffic for centuries. People from villages have been migrating to towns and cities and especially overseas to United Kingdom (London, Birmingham, Manchester, Oldham, Scunthorpe, Leeds and Sunderland) whilst people from other parts of Bangladesh, especially from Comilla, Noakhali, Barishal, Faridpur and Mymensingh, are filling up the vacuum created by relocation of the native people. It has been identified that migration is occurring amongst people of two specific categories and they are moving out of rural to urban areas for employment and economic reasons. Category 1 consists of people who have acquired education and seek employment. A large section of the first educated mass and elite alike have migrated to Sunamganj Municipality. Majority of the lawyers and government employees from Jagannathpur have migrated to Sunamganj town from the time of creation of Pakistan in 1947 and before the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. Category 2 consists of well-heeled mass and elite, mainly of immigrant community and they have purchased second homes in the city of Sylhet and partially relocated in the city and abroad. The necessity of moving to city was felt in the years immediately after the independence of Bangladesh due to targeted robberies and harassing of so-called ‘Londoni’ families and villages during the entire decade of the 1970s. Another contributory factor was communications. Jagannathpur was isolated from both Sunamganj and Sylhet towns till the 1990s and amenities were very scarce. The second and third generations of category 1 and 2 are also migrating to the metropolis of Dhaka. The trend of migrating to Dhaka culminated with the millennium development activities from the eve of 2000 CE. As of 1986, an estimated 95 per cent of the Bangladeshi community in the UK originate from the Sylhet region, and Jagannathpur is one of the upazilas in Sylhet which has the highest number of expatriates in the UK. They mainly settled in towns and cities such as St Albans (Hertfordshire), London, in particular Tower Hamlets, people from Jagannathpur can be found in the Brick Lane area (Spitalfields and Banglatown), Newham and Redbridge and Birmingham, Oldham, Leeds, Northampton, Bedford Kidderminster, Haslingden and Sunderland. A wave of immigration from Jagannathpur began after the post war shortages of industrial labour in England. This was combined with a further a sudden industrial boom of the cotton industry, mainly young men were given the opportunity to immigrate to the UK and work in the cotton mills. Migration took place for various reason such as for a better quality of life or wealth, escape poverty, and send money back home for financial support. Many people of Jagannathpur had previously resided in the villages, and agricultural business was a major occupation as many farmers owned a vast amount of rich paddy fields and estates. Due to immigration, there has been a large shift in the demographics and statistics of Jaganathpur, and also the entire region of Sylhet. The second generation settlers live in the UK and regard it as their home. Despite the cultural barriers and the perceived isolation there has been a paramount of success breeding from the people of Jaganathpur and other parts of Sylhet. They have overcome institutionalised racism, language barriers, social barriers and religious barriers to produce a successful and highly educated young population. Most of whom are now entrepreneurs, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, politicians, biomedical scientists and other professionals. A fair number of people from Jaganathpur have found success and fame through the catering industry and are very successful restaurateurs throughout the country, although the industry is known as Indian, the majority are in fact Bangladeshi origin and essence, as over 85 per cent of Indian restaurants in the UK are owned and managed by Bangladeshi Sylhetis. Shah Abdul Majid Qureshi who was a pioneer in the curry industry was from Jagannathpur, including Anwar Choudhury \\\\- the first and, as of 2004, only Bangladeshi-born and Bangladeshi ethnic British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Cllr Ghulam Murtuza — the first Bangladeshi born Mayor in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and Ahmed Fakhruddin — late veteran community activist was also from Jagannathpur. Haji Abdul Motin aka Motin Miah, a non-resident British Bangladeshi organizer of Bangladesh independent war in 1971 at manchester, and Alhajj Mohammed Gulzar Hussain, a non resident British Bangladeshi organizer of Bangladesh independent war in 1971 at St. Albans, UK were also from Jagannathpur. The first person from Syedpur to be elected to both council seats was Cllr Syed Mumshad Ahmed, son of Alhajj Syed Mostaque Ahmed (kidderminster, wyre forest district councillor 2008 and worcesterhires county councillor 2009). Administration Map of Jagannathpur Upazila A separate Thana was established at Jagannathpur on 1 October 1920 by a gazette notification by Anamul Haque of Parargaon; the thana was upgraded first as an Upazila in 1983, and then as a municipality on the 29 September 1999.An introduction to Jagannathpur Jagannathpur.com In the Upazila of Jagannathpur, there are 1 municipality, 8 union councils, 9 wards, 43 mahallahs, 263 mauzas and 310 villages.

Biography  Albert Cobo was born in Detroit on October 2, 1893.; note image of plaque. He married his childhood sweetheart, Ethel; the couple had two daughters, Jean and Elaine. Cobo opened and ran two candy stores in Detroit, while attending night school to study business administration and accounting at the Detroit Business Institute. After completing his studies, he sold his stores and went to work for Burroughs Corporation, working his way up to an executive position. In 1933 during the Great Depression, the Burroughs Adding Machine Co. lent Cobo, an accountant, to the city for six months to help it fix its troubled books. He subsequently ran for and was elected Detroit City Treasurer in 1935. As Treasurer he helped keep tax-delinquent Detroiters in their homes through a seven-year tax payment plan. The move helped endear him to voters, and, after seven terms as treasurer, he was elected mayor in 1949. He won, and was elected twice more, in 1951 and 1953 (the third time for four years). A major aspect of Cobo's campaign and subsequent terms in office involved urban renewal and to reinvent an aging city. Cobo was the driving force behind the development of the city's Civic Center. Cobo vigorously opposed public housing because he opposed subsidies for poor people in favor of more private ownership of property. While his opponent George Edwards openly supported the provision of public housing for families in any neighborhood of Detroit. Cobo campaigned against the \\"Negro Invasion\\" of white neighborhoods. Twelve proposals for public housing in Detroit were under consideration when Cobo was elected mayor, and he adamantly opposed the construction of all but four sites, all in city centers with a large black population. By slowing and stopping the construction process for public housing and placing single-family home developer Harry J. Durbin in charge of the Detroit Housing Commission, Cobo significantly limited the housing options for poor families in 1950s Detroit. Accordingly, Cobo once said in a radio interview, \\"The people who pay taxes want better services for their money.\\", keying in that private property owners, and not public housing benefactors, were the ones primarily paying the city taxes. Cobo also heavily pushed for the expansion of the expressway system; many of his backers were wealthy suburbanites, who wanted a faster, easier commute into the city. Cobo was mayor at the apex of the city's population of about 1.8 million in 1950. He died in his office in 1957. Cobo ran on the Republican ticket in 1956 for governor of Michigan, but was handily beaten by G. Mennen Williams, his first loss after ten successful citywide campaigns. He did not seek a fourth term as mayor in 1957. Cobo served as president of the American Municipal Association and a trustee of the United States Conference of Mayors. He died of a heart attack on September 12, 1957, just months before his last term in office would have ended. Cobo Center (formerly Cobo Hall) was built and named in his honor. However, on August 27, 2019, the facility was renamed TCF Center. Cobo is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery. http://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/rochelle- riley/2017/05/08/replace-cobo-name-joe-louis-convention-center/101442120/ References External links * Category:1893 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Mayors of Detroit Category:American Congregationalists Category:Michigan Republicans Category:Burroughs Corporation people Category:Burials at Woodlawn Cemetery (Detroit, Michigan) Category:People who died in office Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Albert Cobo"},{"id":"9495170","text":"Sympathy is a blackened death metal band from Canada, formed in 1991.

It is one of the four schools of the Fern Ridge School District and provides an education of grades 9-12 for the city of Veneta, as well as for the towns of Elmira, Noti and Walton. Total enrollment numbers range from 350 to 450 students with a roughly even gender ratio. They operate on a seven period schedule over the course of two semesters, beginning in early September and ending in early June. EHS has four main buildings. In the lower left corner of the school consists of the main office and entrance, the theatre, library and the main studio for the school's radio station KOCF 92.7 FM, hosted by Stuart \\"Stu\\" Burgess. This building also contains the main hallways for the sophomore, junior and senior classes, as well as the counseling and learning centers. There is also an outdoor area outside of the building for social gatherings between students during passing periods and lunch. In the lower right corner is where the main gym and auxiliary gym are situated, as well as the freshman hallway and the Home Ec classroom. The auxiliary gym used to be the school's front entrance, however due to the athletics department asking for more practicing space and extracurricular opportunities, the auxiliary gym was built to satisfy those needs, and the school went for a more interior focused entrance. In the upper left corner is the Cafeteria, and in the upper right corner is the Band/Choir room, the weight room and workshops for students interested in welding, carpentry, woodworking and more. Academics In 2008, 83% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 108 students, 90 graduated, 5 dropped out, 33 received a modified diploma, and 33 are still in high school. As of 2020, 92% of the school's 92 seniors received their high school diploma, a 9% increase since 2008.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 39,059 and it contained 13,418 housing units. In 2001, the village of Homer Glen was incorporated within area that is Homer Township. This region was formerly an unincorporated census-designated place known as Goodings Grove, Illinois. Homer Township, located between Orland Park, and the historic cities of Lemont and Lockport, offers parks, golf courses and many beautiful wooded settings, as well as convenient access to route 83 and interstates 355 and 55. In 2011, Homer Glen was the third community to be named an International Dark-Sky Community by the International Dark Sky Association (IDA). This highly distinguished honor has only been bestowed on four communities to date. The award acknowledges that the Village has been selected as a community that has taken extraordinary steps in recognizing and preserving the natural night. To achieve the IDSC award, the Village of Homer Glen demonstrated that it has shown “exceptional dedication to the preservation of the night sky through the implementation and enforcement of quality lighting codes, dark sky education and citizen support of dark skies.” In 2007, the Village passed a ground breaking outdoor lighting ordinance which became the first stand alone ordinance of its kind in Illinois. The ordinance provides a clear set of guidelines eliminating the need for commercial establishments to compete for visual attention by escalating their outdoor lighting levels. It also requires full cutoff lighting, limits the amount of light that is used on the property, promotes the safety and welfare of pedestrians, cyclists and motorists who all benefit from the reduction of glare, reduces the detrimental effect to wildlife that depend on the natural cycle of day and night for survival and protects neighbors from unwanted light spilling onto their property. These sound environmental policies benefit residents and serve as a positive example for reducing the amount of energy consumed and natural resources used. Additionally, the Homer Glen ordinance reduces both money spent on over-lighting, as well as light projected into the night sky. Geography According to the 2010 census, the township has a total area of , of which (or 99.89%) is land and (or 0.14%) is water.

His father, Lucius D. Clay Sr. and his brother, Frank Butner Clay, were also both generals, and his grandfather was Senator Alexander Stephens Clay of Georgia. Biography Clay was born in Alexandria, Virginia in 1919, the son of then-2nd Lieutenant (later General) Lucius D. Clay Sr., U.S. Army.

The Spirits of St. Louis had some earlier connections to Utah. On November 29, 1975, the Spirits of St. Louis and the Utah Stars had discussed a merger of the two franchises. On December 1, 1975, the Spirits announced that they would remain in St. Louis after word leaked out that they were contemplating a merger with the Stars, with the resulting team playing in Utah. The Stars folded and on December 2, 1975, the Spirits of St. Louis obtained some of Utah's best players: Moses Malone, Ron Boone, Randy Denton and Steve Green. At the end of the 1975–76 ABA season, the Virginia Squires folded after being unable to make a league-mandated financial payment. Because the Baltimore Claws had folded in the preseason and the San Diego Sails and Utah Stars folded during the regular season, the ABA went from ten teams in the preseason to only six at the end of the season. The six remaining teams were the Indiana Pacers, San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, New York Nets, Kentucky Colonels and the Spirits of St. Louis. On May 19, 1976, the Spirits of St. Louis announced that they planned to relocate to Salt Lake City, Utah, as the Utah Rockies for the 1976–77 season, and that negotiations were underway for the team to play at the Salt Palace. Meanwhile, discussions that eventually resulted in the ABA-NBA merger were nearing completion. As part of the franchise shift, Spirits owners Daniel and Ozzie Silna proposed that they would sell the team to a group in Utah, and then purchase the Kentucky Colonels with the intention of moving the franchise to Buffalo, New York, home of the Buffalo Braves, an NBA team that was contemplating moving to Florida. Colonels owner John Y. Brown, Jr., ultimately took a cash payout when the ABA- NBA merger occurred, and used the money to purchase a 50% interest in the Braves himself. After a complex transaction which led to Brown becoming owner of the Boston Celtics, the Braves moved to San Diego in 1978 as the San Diego Clippers, who in turn became the Los Angeles Clippers in 1984. On June 17, 1976, the ABA and NBA announced the ABA-NBA merger that brought the Spurs, Pacers, Nets and Nuggets into the NBA but left out the Colonels and the Spirits/Rockies clubs. Brown received a flat $3 million in cash for the Colonels. The owners of the Spirits/Rockies received $2.2 million in cash and a one-seventh share of the four remaining ABA teams' television revenues in perpetuity. That deal has been reported as worth approximately $170 million in the years since; the Utah Rockies' owners were made multimillionaires through NBA television revenue even though the team never played a single NBA game. The Spirits/Rockies players were released to a dispersal draft, as were the Colonels' players. Marvin Barnes went to the Detroit Pistons. Moses Malone went to the Portland Trail Blazers. Randy Denton went to the New York Knicks. Ron Boone and Mike Barr went to the Kansas City Kings. Professional basketball returned to Salt Lake City when the New Orleans Jazz relocated in 1979 to become the Utah Jazz.

The opening chapters outline Landis' upbringing in a Mennonite community in Farmersville, Pennsylvania. The Mennonites are similar to the Amish community, but embrace modern culture to a greater extent than the Amish. Landis tells us how his cycling initially caused some friction in his family but how his mother and father ended up supporting his ambitions to become a professional cyclist and eventually watched him win the Tour De France. The book takes us through his early associations with various mountain biking teams and his transition into a world class road racer who eventually becomes Lance Armstrong's most dependable domestique on the US Postal cycling team helping Armstrong to win the 2002, 2003 and 2004 Tours. Landis mentions his right hip problems throughout the book. In 2003 he broke his hip in a cycling accident and it never really recovered. Landis did however manage to cycle four tours (and win one in the process) on a right hip bone that was slowly disintegrating and rotting away. He put off surgery in order to win the 2006 TDF even though he could barely walk, but eventually succumbed to the knife in Sept 2006 and had the hip replaced. Landis states that his ultimate aim will be to form a Floyd Landis Foundation whose aim will be to inform people about Severe Avascular Necrosis, the condition which attacked his hip. The relationship between Landis and Armstrong is explored in great detail, from the earliest days when it appears that Landis was in awe of Armstrong to the eventual break up of their relationship in 2004-05 when Landis displayed his own ambitions to become leader of a team. Landis writes that Armstrong was \\"The Boss\\" of the professional cycling peloton and crushed any sign of personal ambition in any of his team mates. There was no room for anyone with a bigger ego or bigger ideas than Armstrong and Landis, it appears, had both. Landis led something of a revolt in the US Postal team by asking and exposing what each rider was earning, and when he did not consider he was being paid what he was worth Landis went looking elsewhere. Landis describes how US Postal tried to undermine his negotiations with the Phonak cycling squad by suggesting that Landis had signed a new contract with them (which was untrue), however Landis ended up as team leader of Phonak after Tyler Hamilton tested positive for doping and went into the 2006 Tour de France as one of the favorites. Surprisingly the 2006 Tour is not covered in huge detail until we get to the time of Landis' positive test after Stage 17. During Stage 16, while wearing the yellow jersey, Landis has a disastrous stage and loses time to second- placed rider Oscar Pereiro. Landis describes how he \\"has nothing to lose\\" and attacks from the start of Stage 17, eventually winning it by over 8 minutes and ultimately reclaiming the yellow jersey and the overall TDF title. Unfortunately for Landis, the urine sample he provides after Stage 17 shows an abnormally high level of synthetic testosterone (not occurring naturally in the body), but he does not get to know about this until after the tour has finished. Landis goes into great detail of how wronged he feels and how devastated he, his wife Amber, and his team are. He is sacked by Phonak and has not raced on the road since. The last few chapters describe his fight against the cycling authorities. The World Anti Doping Association (WADA) and its president Dick Pound come in for some particular criticism, with Landis describing them as Judge, Jury and Executioner and labeling Pound as \\"a liar\\" who attempted to smear Landis by allegedly releasing information to the media undermining Landis' case. Pound apparently came up with the nickname \\"Roid Floyd\\" for Landis, the Roid part obviously referring to steroids. Landis states that the positive test was not \\"a positive\\" test at all,but was flawed and that his samples were mishandled by the French lab that carried out the tests. Landis describes how his defense team spent months going over the 370 page evidential packet from WADA and numbered many errors that the French lab appears to have made. He explains that he was seen by the USADA (United States anti doping agency) as \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" and warned by the UCI (world cycling federation) not to fight the case because he would lose and be bankrupted. Floyd does not attempt to explain why he tested positive because he can't, but strenuously denies doping. The warning he receives proves to be prophetic as Landis explains that his defense has cost him over a million dollars and led to the formation of the Floyd Fairness Fund which aims to ensure that no one has to go through what Landis has had to because of what he claims is a flawed doping procedure. The book ends with Landis expressing hope of acquittal. Landis was stripped of his TDF title in September 2007; in May 2010 he confessed to doping and accused Lance Armstrong of doing the same, contradicting the entire premise of the book.New York Daily News: Floyd Landis outlines elaborate doping system in letters, details Lance Armstrong's alleged role References Category:American autobiographies Category:Cycling books ","title":"Positively False"},{"id":"9495430","text":"Amans or Vaudechamp Étienne Mazureau (1777–1849) had a distinguished career as a French and later a Louisiana lawyer, serving three times as Attorney General of Louisiana and as Secretary of State of Louisiana.

This album is considered to be their first effort as a band, because all the musicians appeared as full-time members, and contributed to the composition, arrangements, and recording of the album. It had a great reception in Spain and the band won several metal music awards.

In mid-2002 WarCry began recording a new album, with the idea to release it at the end of the year. As Víctor handled keyboard duties on the first album, the band decided to recruit a full-time member to cover that position. They held the auditions from June to August 2002, finally deciding on Galician keyboardist Manuel Ramil. The album was produced by Víctor and Ardines, and recorded, mixed, and edited in Jaus Records. On November 2002, started the album- mastering and manufacturing by David de la Torre, in the M20 Studios in Madrid.

Roosevelt and Winston Churchill meeting at the Tehran Conference in 1943 Chiang Kai-shek, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill met at the Cairo Conference in 1943 during World War II. The term \\"Four Policemen\\" refers to a post-war council consisting of the Big Four that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a guarantor of world peace. The members of the Big Four, called the Four Powers during World War II, were the four major Allies of World War II: the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China. The United Nations envisioned by Roosevelt consisted of three branches: an executive branch comprising the Big Four, an enforcement branch composed of the same four great powers acting as the Four Policemen or Four Sheriffs, and an international assembly representing the member nations of the UN. The Four Policemen would be responsible for keeping order within their spheres of influence: Britain in its empire and in Western Europe; the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe and the central Eurasian landmass; China in East Asia and the Western Pacific; and the United States in the Western hemisphere. As a preventive measure against new wars, countries other than the Four Policemen were to be disarmed. Only the Four Policemen would be allowed to possess any weapons more powerful than a rifle. As a compromise with internationalist critics, the Big Four nations became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, with significantly less power than envisioned in the Four Policemen proposal. When the United Nations was officially established in later 1945, France was in due course added as the fifth member of the council at that time due to the insistence of Churchill. History =Background= During World War II, President Roosevelt initiated post-war plans for the creation of a new and more durable international organization that would replace the former League of Nations. Prior to the war, Roosevelt had initially been a supporter of the League of Nations, but he lost confidence in the League due to its ineffectiveness at preventing the outbreak of the Second World War. Roosevelt wanted to create an international organization that secured global peace through the unified efforts of the world's great powers, rather than through the Wilsonian notions of international consensus and collaboration that guided the League of Nations. By 1935, he told his foreign policy adviser Sumner Welles: \\"The League of Nations has become nothing more than a debating society, and a poor one at that!\\" Roosevelt criticized the League of Nations for representing the interests of too many nations. The President said to the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov that \\"he could not visualize another League of Nations with 100 different signatories; there were simply too many nations to satisfy, hence it was a failure and would be a failure\\". Roosevelt's proposal in 1941 was to create a new international body led by a \\"trusteeship\\" of great powers that would oversee smaller countries. In September 1941, he wrote: The State Department had begun drafting a postwar successor to the League of Nations under the auspices of Roosevelt while the United States was still formally a neutral power. Roosevelt was reluctant to publicly announce his plans for creating a postwar international body. He was aware of the risk that the American people might reject his proposals, and he did not want to repeat Woodrow Wilson's struggle to convince the Senate to approve American membership in the League of Nations. When the Atlantic Charter was issued in August 1941, Roosevelt had ensured that the charter omitted mentioning any American commitment towards the establishment of a new international body after the war. The attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to a change in Roosevelt's position. He transformed his trusteeship proposal into an organization centered around the Four Policemen: the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain. =Plans for the Four Policemen= 1943 sketch by Franklin Roosevelt of the United Nations' original three branches. The branch on the right represents the Four Policemen. The idea that great powers should \\"police\\" the world had been discussed by President Roosevelt as early as August 1941, during his first meeting with Winston Churchill. Roosevelt made his first references to the Four Policemen proposal in early 1942. He presented his postwar plans to Molotov, who had arrived in Washington on May 29 to discuss the possibility of launching a second front in Europe. Roosevelt told Molotov that the Big Four must unite after the war to police the world and disarm aggressor states. When Molotov asked about the role of other countries, Roosevelt answered by opining that too many \\"policemen\\" could lead to infighting, but he was open to the idea of allowing other allied countries to participate. A memorandum of the conference summarizes their conversation: Roosevelt and Molotov continued their discussion of the Four Policemen in a second meeting on June 1. Molotov informed the President that Stalin was willing to support Roosevelt's plans for maintaining postwar peace through the Four Policemen and enforced disarmament. Roosevelt also raised the issue of postwar decolonization. He suggested that former colonies should undergo a period of transition under the governance of an international trusteeship prior to their independence. China was brought in as a member of the Big Four and a future member of the Four Policemen. Roosevelt was in favor of recognizing China as a great power because he was certain that the Chinese would side with the Americans against the Soviets. He said to British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, \\"In any serious conflict of policy with Russia, [China] would undoubtedly line up on our side.\\" As it was before the Chinese Civil War ensued, he did not mean the Communist China, but the Republic of China. The President believed that a pro- American China would be useful for the United States should the Americans, Soviets, and Chinese agree to jointly occupy Japan and Korea after the war. When Molotov voiced concerns about the stability of China, Roosevelt responded by saying that the combined \\"population of our nations and friends was well over a billion people.\\" Churchill objected to Roosevelt's inclusion of China as one of the Big Four because he feared that the Americans were trying to undermine Britain's colonial holdings in Asia. In October 1942, Churchill told Eden that Republican China represented a \\"faggot vote on the side of the United States in any attempt to liquidate the British overseas empire.\\" Eden shared this view with Churchill and expressed skepticism that China, which was then in the midst of a civil war, could ever return to a stable nation. Roosevelt responded to Churchill's criticism by telling Eden that \\"China might become a very useful power in the Far East to help police Japan\\" and that he was fully supportive of offering more aid to China. Roosevelt's Four Policemen proposal received criticism from the liberal internationalist who wanted power to be more evenly distributed among the member nations of the UN. Internationalists were concerned that the Four Policemen could lead to a new Quadruple Alliance. =Formation of the United Nations= On New Year's Day 1942, the representatives of Allied \\"Big Four\\", the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China, signed a short document which later came to be known as the Declaration by United Nations and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures. A new plan for the United Nations was drafted by the State Department in April 1944. It kept the emphasis on great power solidarity that was central to Roosevelt's Four Policemen proposal for the United Nations. The members of the Big Four would serve as permanent members of the United Nation's Security Council. Each of the four permanent members would be given a United Nations Security Council veto power, which would override any UN resolution that went against the interests of one of the Big Four. However, the State Department had compromised with the liberal internationalists. Membership eligibility was widened to include all nation states fighting against the Axis powers instead of a select few. The Dumbarton Oaks Conference convened in August 1944 to discuss plans for the postwar United Nations with delegations from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. The Big Four were the only four sponsoring countries of the San Francisco Conference of 1945 and their heads of the delegations took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings. During this conference, the Big Four and their allies signed the Charter of the United Nations.

History In 1779, the Khasi people attacked merchants in the village of Pandua in Bholaganj, who were going towards Calcutta after they experienced abuse from Europeans. Many merchants pleaded Robert Lindsay, the Collector of Sylhet, to build a small brick fort to protect them from further attacks from the Khasi. In 1789, the Collector of Sylhet, John Willes, stationed many sepoys in Pandua. The Khasi however, continued their attacks, killing the thanadar and many sepoys. Two European merchants managed to escape and inform Willes of the incident, who passed it on to the Government at Calcutta. A force was then sent from there to the village of Pandua, although it led to a bloodless end. Willes also told the government that he really had little control over northern Sylhet as the Khasi chiefs refused every order, would behead the messenger and then continue raiding Sylheti villages as they had done even during the Mughal Empire period. Another Khasi raid took place in 1795 and many years went after that with the Khasis remaining in their hills and not troubling the plains. In 1976, the Companiganj Thana was established based in the village of Burdeo in the banks of the Dhalai River. It consisted of the current Companiganj Upazila but also included Islampur Union (Chhatak), Jalalabad Union (Sylhet Sadar) as well as Rustampur & Towakul Unions (Gowainghat). The reason for the creation of a thana was because there were no main roads leading to the town and the only access was through rivers during the rainy season. The East India Company had a strong presence in the business sector in this area and thus it was named Companiganj. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Companiganj was part of the Bholaganj sub- sector in Sector 5 under the charge of Lieutenant Taheruddin Akhunji. 19 freedom fighters were killed in this area. It was made an upazila on 11 November 1982 by the President of Bangladesh, H M Ershad, as a part of his decentralisation programme.

History Pan, Pani Nari- Ei tiney Jaintapuri- Betel, water and women, these three make Jaintapuri. That's the first line of a rhyme that has become something of a catchphrase among Sylhetis to describe Jaintapur, a historically rich upazila of Sylhet. A long time ago, the present plain land was probably under water and part of a huge water body, which might have separated Jaintapur from Sylhet, historians say. Because of this geophysical condition, the region remained independent for a long time and was known as the Jaintia Kingdom. Jaintia was a hill kingdom of ancient Meghalaya. In the sixteenth century, most of the greater Sylhet region was under the jurisdiction of Jaintia king who ruled from the capital Jaintapur. The inhabiting Khashia people (ethnic group) had a matriarchal society and its own language. Sometime around 1500, the then king Parbat Roy adopted his Sanskrit name. The king of Cooch Bihar conquered Jaintia sometime between 1548 and 1564. Late that century, the Jaintia kingdom was governed under the kingdom of Cachhar Raja. The Jaintia kingdom regained independence in 1605 with the help of Ahom Raja. Lakshmi Narayan was a strong king (1669-1697) who was famous for the construction of buildings using bricks at his capital at Jaintapur. The British East India Company drove the Jaintia king from the plains of Sylhet in 1765. The kingdom lost its independence when the Burmese conquered Assam in 1824. Again the British drove the Burmese away while the kingdom's independence was restored in 1825. To facilitate their trade of limestone and canes in Sylhet, the East India Company annexed the Jaintia kingdom to their Bengal state in 1935. According to the local legends and folk tales, from the seventh or eighth century, the Jaintapur kingdom came under the control of the Kamrup Kingdom and later the same year under the control Chandra and Varman rulers. After the fall of Varmans, the kingdom again went under the rule of the Deva dynasty for some time. Jayanta Roy, the last ruler of the Deva dynasty had a daughter named Joyonti, who was married to a son of Khashi chief-Landowner. Because of this marriage, the kingdom came under the ruling of the Khashis in around 1500. It remained as an independent kingdom under the Khashis till 1824. There are still plenty of visitor attractions at the remains of Jaintapur, which include the temple of Jainteswari, the Rajbari (palace) and the monuments. These remnants, however, are now quite dilapidated. The palace built by King Lakshmi Sinha (1670-1701) in 1680 is ruined. The main structure of the temple has also been heavily damaged. However, the temple area has a boundary wall now. Some of the ancient monuments at Jaintapur are sites of tremendous historical interest. The lone megalithic remains discovered so far in Bangladesh are located in Jaintapur. They are similar to the ones discovered in India. There are 42 structures around the Jainteswari temple area (located very close to the Jaintapur bus stand). Among them, nineteen megaliths can be seen by the side of the temple. There are eight structures near the Jaintapur Shahid Minar area while there are many others in broken pieces. Five stands at the southern side of the Sylhet-Tamabil Road. There are seven other structures at a place about one and a half kilometers off the Jainteswari temple and near the northern side of the Nayagang River. Many of the remains =1971 War= In 1971 the Pakistani Army engaged in torture, genocide, and plundering; soldiers also set many houses of the upazila on fire. The Pakistani Army killed a number of innocent persons at the village of Hemo by strafing via fighter planes. Additionally, the Pakistani Army brutally killed 30 persons including the Khan Tea Garden workers.

Among its founders were Norwid Neugebauer, Marian Januszajtis-Żegota, Henryk Bagiński and Eugeniusz Homer. The organization was similar in spirit to, and closely cooperated with, the Riflemen's Association. It too was supported by the Austro-Hungarian government, which wanted to raise a Polish army for use in World War I. By 1914 the organization numbered 6,000 members. Most of them joined Józef Piłsudski's Polish Legions in World War I. Before its legalization, the PDS operated as an underground organization called Polish Military Alliance (Polski Zwiazek Wojskowy, PZW). Its objective was to prepare the Polish nation for fight for independence, with emphasis on training of officer corps of the future army. In October 1910, the PZW took the name Armia Polska (Polish Army), organizing paramilitary courses in Austrian Galicia, as well as in Congress Poland and Vienna. In 1911-1912, after legalization and changing name to Polish Rifle Squads, the organization had 650 members. By the outbreak of the First World War, its membership grew rapidly, to over 6,000 members, divided into 127 so-called rifle teams. The PDS closely cooperated with the Union of Active Struggle, and as a result, both organizations coordinated their activities, introducing same kind of uniforms.

Kryptonics were contemporaries of notable Perth bands The Stems, The Triffids & The Bamboos, and released a series of 7\\" singles and 12\\" vinyl EPs on a number of Australian independent record labels. Biography Guitarist, Ian Underwood first met Cathy Webb (bass guitar) at Balcatta Senior High School in 1982, forming a band, when drummer Shakir Pichler answered a drummer wanted classified ad. The Kryptonics spent eighteen months in rehaersals before their first public performance, supporting The Stems in August 1985. Underwood however was not confident singing and playing guitar at the same time so Michael Reynolds was approached to perform lead vocals for the band. Shortly after the band recorded its first single, \\"Baby\\" / \\"Plastic Imitation\\" on local label, Cherry Top. On the eve of the single being released in January 1986 Pichler left the band to join another local band, The Bamboos. With the loss of Pichler, Underwood decided to go for an even bigger change with the band line-up, taking over the front man responsibilities from Reynolds and recruiting drummer Brett Ford, who had been spending time in England, and had just returned to Perth. In addition to Ford, they also had decided to add a guitar player, Peter Hartley, from a band called Lavender Disaster. With the new line-up the released their next single, \\"Land That Time Forgot\\" / \\"She's Got Germs\\", in 1987 on the Easter label and the flexi-single \\"Cyclops\\" / \\"Rock Me to Sleep\\" which came with issue No. 6 of Vortex fanzine. By this time, the band had reached the critical point where Perth bands either collapse or make the attempt at going the next step up, playing interstate. Playing interstate from Perth however is a different story than touring out of Brisbane, Melbourne or Adelaide. On their first trip, their van broke down in some little town in the middle of nowhere, and they spent three days trying to get rolling again with gigs waiting on the other end of the country. When they finally got up on a Sydney stage, things went much better. The band played well and audiences liked them, and they got to open for bands such as The Screaming Tribesmen and The Psychotic Turnbuckles. They also did some shows as headliners in smaller hotels. Chris Dunn from Waterfront Records saw them a couple times on this tour and told them that if they ever wanted to make a record, to come see him at Waterfront. After a two- week tour of Sydney, the band returned to Perth, but, buoyed by the success of the tour, they decided to try it again. The trip was a disaster, with Ford and Underwood getting arrested halfway across the Nullabor, subsequent tour dates being cancelled or rescheduled, resulting in a split within the band. Webb, Ford and Hartley all left the band and they were replaced by Russell Hopkinson and Greg Hitchcock, both from The Bamboos. This line-up recorded the band's first EP, Sixty Nine, which was released by Sydney-based label Waterfront in May 1989. Hopkinson and Hitchcock however left the band prior to the tour to promote the record, leaving Underwood to recruit his fourth line-up. There were numerous changes to the drummer and bass player, before the line-up of Underwood (vocals and guitar), Tony Rushan (guitar), Peter Kostic (drums) and Jeff Halley (bass) was eventually finalised. The band issued the single \\"When It's Over\\" / \\"Oedipus Complex\\" on Waterfront in September 1989. A revised line-up of Underwood, Rushan, Kostic and Greg Brennan on bass recorded a new single for the Seaside label, \\"Bad September\\" / \\"Another Girl Another Planet\\" (live) / \\"Telephone Line\\" (live) which was released in November 1990. Richard Corey replaced Brennan in July 1990, and the band re-located to Sydney in August 1990 and toured heavily up and down the Eastern seaboard. The Kryptonics issued a 12-inch EP, Tonka Tuff, on the Zero Hour label in 1991 before parting company in mid-1992. They are remembered chiefly today for the number of ex-members who have gone to feature prominently in high-profile Australian artists including You Am I, Front End Loader, Lubricated Goat, Regurgitator & The Chevelles. Underwood later formed Challenger 7 in Sydney in 1995, and recorded a mini album with the help of former Kryptonics members Greg Hitchcock, Peter Kostic and Richard Corey. He continued with that band under different line-ups until its demise in 2002. He now runs Reverberation, a Sydney-based independent label and distributor with his former bandmate Russell Hopkinson. In November 2007 Underwood, Kostic, Corey and Rushan reformed to play a one-off performance in Perth, where they were joined by former guitarist Hitchcock for a number of songs.

Athalie Range, circa 1972 M. Athalie Range (born Mary Athalie Wilkinson; November 7, 1915 in Key West, Florida – November 14, 2006 in Miami, Florida) was a Bahamian American civil rights activist and politician who was the first African-American to serve on the Miami, Florida City Commission, and the first African-American since Reconstruction and the first woman to head a Florida state agency, the Department of Community Affairs. Early life and marriage Mary Athalie Wilkinson was born in Key West, Florida on November 7, 1915. Her grandparents had all been immigrants from the Bahamas. When Athalie was five or six years old, the Wilkinson family moved to Miami. Athalie Wilkinson graduated from all-black Booker T. Washington High School in Overtown, Miami. She married Oscar Lee Range in 1937 & had 4 children Myrna, Patrick, Oscar, and Gary. During this period the Ranges lived in the Liberty Square Housing Project. During World War II Athalie Range found work cleaning trash from railroad cars.Dunn. P. 185-6 Robinson In 1953 Oscar Range became a certified funeral director and opened the Range Funeral Home in the Liberty City neighborhood in Miami. Oscar Range died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1960. Athalie Range then enrolled in the New England Institute of Anatomy and Embalming and obtained her funeral director certification so that she could operate the family business. The Range Funeral Homes eventually expanded to three locations, and Athalie Range continued to work in the business for the rest of her life.Alcantara Dunn. P. 186 Robinson School activism In 1948 Athalie Range became President of the Parent Teacher Association at her children's school, Liberty City Elementary. The school had 1200 students and consisted of all portable classrooms, with no permanent buildings. There were only some twelve toilets for boys and for girls. The only drinking fountains were outside, fed by pipes laid on top of the ground, so that the water was usually too hot to drink. There were no trees or grassy areas on the school grounds and no lunchroom. Liberty City Elementary was one of the few schools in the (county-wide) school district holding two half-day sessions.Dunn. P. 186 Robinson. Range led 125 African-American parents from the school to a meeting of the school board to present their demands for improvements to the school. After delaying the start of the meeting for an hour, the board heard Athalie Range speak. Much to her surprise, the board agreed to make improvements. They ordered hot meals to be provided by a nearby white school to Liberty City Elementary, moved another portable to the school to use in serving the hot lunches, and began construction of a new, permanent school building, the first school for African-Americans built in the district in twenty-one years. Althalie Range continued to serve as President of school and county-wide PTAs for sixteen years.Alcantara. Dunn. P. 186 Robinson. City Commission In 1965 Alice Wainwright, who was the first woman to serve on the Miami City Commission, decided to not seek re-election. Athalie Range became a candidate for the vacant seat, the first African- American to run for the City Commission. She won a plurality in the primary election, although not a majority. In the runoff election, Range's opponent, a white man named Irwin Christie, sent a sound truck through white neighborhoods the day before the election broadcasting the message that if the white people did not get out and vote, they would have a black woman making laws for them. Athalie Range would later say, \\"His campaign decided to play the race card, which took me out of contention.\\" Many black voters had been allowed to take time off from work to vote in the primary, but were not allowed to do so for the runoff. Range lost the runoff, receiving about 17,000 votes, while Christie received about 18,000. Christie later apologized to Range for the way he had run his campaign, and she accepted the apology.Alcantara. Dunn. P. 187-8 Robinson. In 1966 one of the city commissioners resigned his seat, possibly with the encouragement of Miami Mayor Robert King High. High was running for the Democratic Party nomination for Governor of Florida at the time. He appointed Athalie Range to fill the unexpired term of the commissioner who had resigned. In 1967 and again in 1969 Athalie Range was reelected to the City Commission. While on the commission, Range sought to have garbage collection improved in black neighborhoods, which sometimes went three weeks between garbage pickups, while white neighborhoods got twice a week pickups. After a vote on her proposed ordinance to equalize garbage service was twice postponed, Range had her neighbors bring bags of garbage to the commission meeting and dump them on the commissioners' desks. After that, the ordinance was passed. She also pressed for tighter gun controls but was able to get only part of what she wanted. After a fire caused by a kerosene heater killed eleven people in a house in a black neighborhood, Range led an effort to have such heaters banned in Miami.Alcantara. Dunn. P. 188-9 Robinson. Range approached City Manager Melvin Reese about having an African- American police officer assigned to motorcycle patrol. When Reese resisted, Range made a deal with Mayor High; her vote for buying the land for the proposed Alice Wainwright Park in exchange for an African-American motorcycle patrolman. The first African-American motorcycle patrolman in Miami was Robert Ingraham, who later became Chief of Police and then Mayor of Opa-locka, FloridaDunn. P. 189 When asked about her accomplishments in office, Range said, \\"There were so many inequities in those days that you could just reach out and pick something and change it.\\"Alcantara. Later accomplishments In 1971 newly-elected Florida Governor Reubin Askew appointed Athalie Range as Secretary of the Department of Community Affairs. She became the first African-American since Reconstruction and the first woman ever to head a state agency in Florida. As Secretary, she managed a department with 200 employees and a US$5.2 million annual budget. She remained in the position until 1973.Robinson. In 1974, Athalie Range became the first honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority in the state of Florida. Her membership into the historic African-American sorority was sponsored by the Gamma Zeta Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha. Athalie Range was one of the first African- Americans in Florida to back Jimmy Carter when he ran for President. Range introduced Carter to African-American groups in Florida before he had announced his candidacy. President Carter later appointed Range to a two-year term on the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK) governing board. In a little over thirty years she had gone from cleaning railroad cars to helping run AMTRAK.Dunn. P. 190. Robinson. In 1989 Athalie Range was once again appointed to fill a vacancy on the Miami City Commission. Athalie Range was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2004 she was still helping run the family funeral homes and was serving as Chairman of the Virginia Key Beach Project, which was established to preserve the Virginia Key Beach Park, once the only public beach in Dade County open to African-Americans. Athalie Range Park, and the Athalie Range Olympic Swimming Complex are named after her. Athalie Range died November 14, 2006, in Miami, at the age of 91.

On 26 April 1954, ECOSOC adopted a Resolution to convene a Conference of Plenipotentiaries to \\"regulate and improve the status of stateless persons by an international agreement\\". The ensuing Conference adopted the Convention on 28 September 1954. The Convention entered into force on 6 June 1960. Key substantive content of convention ;Article 1: The Convention applies to stateless persons under the protection of the UNHCR but not to those under the protection of other UN agencies (i.e., UNWRA).

earth) is a 2007 Indian drama film co-written and directed by Rahul Dholakia; David N. Donihue is the other co- writer. The film featured Naseeruddin Shah and Sarika in the lead roles, while Corin Nemec and Raj Zutshi played supporting roles. Made on a budget of US$700,000, the film was shot in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. The film is inspired by the true story of a ten-year-old Parsi boy, Azhar Mody (represented in the film as the character Parzaan Pithawala) who disappeared after the 28 February 2002 Gulbarg Society massacre during which 69 people were killed and which was one of many events in the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002. The film traces the journey of the Pithawala family while trying to locate their missing son. The film was premiered at 36th India International Film Festival in Goa on 26 November 2005, before being released nationwide on 26 January 2007. Plot Allan (Corin Nemec), an American, arrives in Ahmedabad searching for answers, to find internal peace and to understand the world and his troubled life. He chooses India as his school and Gandhi as the subject of his thesis. It is here that he meets the Pithawala family — Cyrus (Naseeruddin Shah), his wife Shernaz (Sarika), son Parzan (Parzan Dastur) and daughter Dilshad (Pearl Barsiwala). The Pithawalas being Parsis follow Zoroastrianism. Through them and the teachings of a Gandhian, Allan starts to find peace of mind. The plot is based on the story of Rupa Mody, whose son went missing after the 2002 Gujarat riots. The ten-year-old Parzan disappears during these riots when their surrounding homes are attacked. Cyrus, Shernaz and Dilshad manage to escape the carnage. In the aftermath of the riots, Cyrus searches for his missing child while fighting for his own sanity. While assisting the Pithawalas in their search, Allan battles to uncover the reason behind the riots in an effort to make some sense of the incident. People start to question government's official explanation of the incident which downplays any conspiracy. As a result, a Human Rights Commission is formed. Through the commission, several witnesses and victims testify against the indifference of the police to protect them from the rioters. The film ends with a dedication to the victims of communal violence. Cast * Naseeruddin Shah as Cyrus * Corin Nemec as Allan * Sarika as Shernaz * Parzan Dastur as Parzan * Pearl Barsiwalla * Raj Zutshi * Asif Basra * Pushpendra Saini * Ram Gopal Bajaj IFFI (2005) Production In the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat, Los Angeles- based director Rahul Dholakia faced a personal tragedy. The riots left his friend's family shattered and this left an indelible mark on him. It hurt him all the more because the incidents happened in his home state. He felt responsible, both morally and socially, and wanted to speak up as a filmmaker. Most of the US$700,000 budget came from two of his Indian friends in the United States. Dholakia chose to make the film in English because he thought that communal riots was a global issue. Furthermore, he was unsure whether he could have the film released in India, given the sensitive nature of the film. While deciding on the cast, Dholakia said that they were not looking at people's physical appearances. He added: > We didn't want glamorous people to play realistic roles. We've shot the film > without any makeup, etc. We needed people who looked believable. So casting > did play a major role, and I'm not even talking about the principal cast. > Every actor in the film has been auditioned, and that includes people with > one line to say or not even that. Veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah was the first and obvious choice for the film. But Dholakia was very apprehensive about whether Shah would agree to do the film, and if he could pay his remuneration. His latter worry was because the film started out as a very low-budget film. After Dholakia narrated the script to him, Shah said, \\"I agree in principle, provided we make this sensitively and sensibly.\\" Shah thought that the film's story needed to be told, and he felt that he had to be part of it. After agreeing to join the cast, Shah did not actively research for his character. Being a parent himself, he felt that it was not difficult for him to empathize with the family whose son was lost in the riots. After 18 years of hiatus, Sarika chose to return to cinema with this film. Since the film dealt with a real and sensitive issue, she felt that Parzania went beyond than being just a film. Despite facing the camera after a long gap, Sarika felt quite comfortable during the shooting. Shortly thereafter, Shah, Sarika and Dholakia went through the script in great detail. Owing to their screen and real-life experiences, Shah and Sarika suggested changes and revised the script several times. Because the film was about communal riots in Gujarat, the film was purposefully not released there, as the cinema owners refused to screen it, fearing backlash. After an initiative by ANHAD, a civil rights group, the film was screened at some places in the state after April 2007. Sarika's acting skills, that were particularly on display in the last scene of the film where she narrates her trauma to the human rights panel, is worth mentioning. She delineates the simultaneously existing emotionally exhausted, as well as, tough nature of an aggrieved mother, who has endured a life changing traumatic experience, by way of her excellent acting. Her acting combined with natural and down to earth expressions, evoked heavy applause from supporters and critics alike, thereby also fetching her a National Award for an actress in a leading role. Her expressions of panic while trying to desperately save herself and her children from the rioting mob are quite laudable. Her natural expressions portraying obvious panic and a sense of responsibility towards her family during the sudden outbreak of the riots are also quite noteworthy.

History There are two theories on the naming of Dhamrai. The first is that during the time of Ashoka, there was a Buddhist called Dharmarajika and that the area was named after him. The discovery of a Buddhist stupa in Savar, about 10 miles from Dhamrai, lends credence to this opinion. Another theory is that in the early fourteenth century, five companions of the Sufi saint Shah Jalal (Tirmidhi Al-Husayni, Haji, Ghazi, Zam Bahadur and Shah Makhdum) came and settled in the sparsely populated and heavily forested area. Food supplies ultimately ran short and one day they found a stray cow wandering about which they slaughtered the cattle to eat and satisfy their hunger. After a few days, they were approached by Dhama Gope and his wife Rai Goalini who claimed that the cow was theirs and demanded compensation for it. The Sufis learnt that the couple was childless. It is said that with their blessings a child was born to the couple and also they said that they would name the place so that their names would forever be remembered. Thus the name Dhamrai (Dham+Rai) came about.Booklet published by Dhamrai Upazila Krishibid Association; published June 2012; Edited by Dulal Chandra Sarkar and Mohammad Shahadat Hossain Dhamrai was once under the Thana (now Upazila) of Savar. Dhamrai became a Thana itself in 1914 during the British rule; the same year Dhamrai Hardinge High School was established. In 1947 it was put under the district of Dhaka. On December 15, 1984 Dhamrai was upgraded into a full-fledged Upazila. Economy The total cultivable land is 23,470 hectares.

Dhamrai is well known for this annual festival all throughout Bangladesh. Roth jatra festival begins on around the 10 days of Bangla Calendar month of Ashar and \\"Ulto Roth\\" takes place one week after. A month-long Roth Maela (রথ মেলা) is held in Dhamrai for this occasion. This commemorates the annual journey of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balarama, and their sister Subhadra to their aunt's temple. During the festival, devotees help pull the Lords' chariot with ropes. They consider this a pious deed and risk their lives in the huge crowd. The huge processions accompanying the chariots play devotional songs with drums, tambourines, trumpets etc. Children line the streets through which the chariot will pass and add to the mass chorus. The Roth cart is approximately 45 feet (14 m) high and pulled by the pilgrims who turn up for the event. Metal Casting:The main center for metal casting in Bangladesh is in Dhamrai. For many generations, this place has produced handmade metal (Bronze)ware for markets throughout Bangladesh, using the lost wax casting (cire perdue) method and hollow casting methodhttp://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2010/01/03/feature_metal.htm that is over 2,000 years old. These methods are used to make items ranging from ornate Hindu and Buddhist statues to simple household objects such as pitchers (kolshi as is locally called) and also items include quality statues, decanters, bowls, spoons and plates. Over the past fifty years, many of the families in Bangladesh who have been involved in the metal casting trade have taken on other work. With stiff competition from inexpensive machine-made aluminium and plastic products coming in from India and other countries in the region, the market for hand-cast items has gradually dwindled away. As a result, the tradition of making handmade cast metal objects is in jeopardy. For example, there are only six people left in Bangladesh who are capable of making masterpiece-quality Hindu and Buddhist images using the lost wax method. Twenty years ago, there were over 30 craftsmen who knew this technique. If this trade is someday lost, an important part of Bangladesh's artistic tradition will vanish forever. Dhamrai is also well known for pottery. NGOs working in Dhamrai: * SOJAG: Works throughout Dhamrai and adjoining Upazilas of Mirzapur, Shaturia, Kaliakoir and Singair.

The neighbourhood is considered a lower-income area with an average family income of $47,581, an average dwelling value of $146,941 and a home ownership rate of 69.1%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $198,822. History A buffalo kill site was found in the King George area, documenting its history back 6000 years. In modern times, the neighbourhood was surveyed in 1907 and originally named Riverview. After the arrival of the Barr Colonists in 1903, the land now referred to as Victoria Park (named after Queen Victoria) was sold to settler and entrepreneur, Frank Butler. Shortly thereafter, the land was subdivided and housing constructed despite an earlier plan that identified the riverbank be reserved for public use. When the City of Saskatoon acquired the land for recreational park purposes, all of the Butler subdivision (with the exception of the gardener's residence) was removed. In 1911, the Public School Board decided to relocate Prince of Wales School to the present site of King George School at 721 Avenue K South. In 1912 the name of the school was changed to honour King George V. Around 1929 the neighbourhood was renamed to incorporate the name of the new public school, and the boundary was redrawn to include the west portion of Spadina Crescent, along Victoria Park. The new boundaries also enclosed an area called Andrews Addition, identified on a 1913 map of registered subdivisions. Saskatoon's Municipal Swimming Pool (now Riversdale Pool) on Avenue H in Victoria Park opened on July 15, 1925, replacing the \\"swimming hole\\" cordoned off at the river's edge. Filtration and chlorination systems were primitive, and the pool was quickly dubbed the \\"Avenue Itch\\" pool. Despite having \\"its own peculiar smell, which was obvious for blocks\\", the pool was hugely popular with the people of Saskatoon. During the Great Depression, admission was \\"five cents if you had it, free if you didn't\\". The housing stock in King George was mostly built before 1960, with a slight majority being constructed prior to World War II. In 1980, the Saskatoon Public School Board designated King George as an Interagency Community School, being one of the first in the province to receive that designation. King George has struggled in its recent history, with a portion of the population living below the poverty line. The social ills that accompany poverty - substance abuse, violent crime and dilapidated housing - have often cast the area in a negative light. The municipal government and community groups are working to improve the neighbourhood and the lives of its residents. Government and politics King George exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon West. It is currently represented by Brad Redekopp of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2019. Provincially, the area is within the constituency of Saskatoon Riversdale. It is currently represented by Danielle Chartier of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party, first elected in 2009. In Saskatoon's non- partisan municipal politics, King George lies within ward 2. It is currently represented by Hilary Gough, first elected in 2016. Institutions =Education= *King George School - public elementary, part of the Saskatoon Public School Division. This school was built in 1912 from a design by David Webster, and constructed with Estevan brick with stone trim. The Masonic symbols on the façade are typical of Webster's designs. Plans called for a domestic science room on the upper floor, quarters for the caretaker, and a dining room. The final cost of construction was $156,210. =Other= *Royal Canadian Legion Chapter 63 - This branch of the Royal Canadian Legion was originally located in downtown Saskatoon. It relocated to the Pensioners and Pioneers Pavilion on Spadina Crescent West in 2007, when the Legion Hall on 19th Street was sold and demolished as part of the River Landing development. *Water Treatment Plant - Originally built in 1906 as a power plant, a filter plant for water services was added in 1911. Two unique features of the Plant include a geodesic dome built in 1988 to cover one of the clarifiers used in the water treatment process, and the reuse of the old Bay walkway that spanned 2nd Avenue between the former Bay building and its adjacent parking lot. Parks and recreation *St. Andrews Park (2.3 acres) *Victoria Park (38.8 acres) - named for Queen Victoria, this public park houses many facilities. While most of the park is in King George, a small portion of the park lies within the Riversdale neighbourhood. The facilities in the park include: :*Riverside Lawn Bowling Club - Lawn bowling club that operates from April to October. :*Riverside Badminton and Tennis Club - Members-only tennis club with both indoor and outdoor courts. :*Lions Skatepark - Skateboard park opened in 2003 with of space. :*Riversdale Pool - Features a waterslide, zero depth water for toddlers, diving boards, playground, volleyball court, basketball, lawn area with electric barbecue and concession. :*Boat house and launch - Owned by the city, its tenants are the Saskatoon Rowing Club, Saskatoon Racing Canoe Club, Saskatoon Canoe Club, and Saskatoon Nordic Ski Club. The King George Community and School Association was created to promote a positive image of the neighbourhood and assist in the development of the cultural, educational, recreational, and social well-being of residents. Commercial Only a few businesses are located in King George, on Avenue P and Avenue H. 33 home-based businesses are based in the neighbourhood. Transportation King George is served by Saskatoon Transit bus route #3. Location King George is located within the Core Neighbourhoods Suburban Development Area. It is bounded by 11th Street to the south, Avenue P to the west and the South Saskatchewan River to the east.

It is located in Shanhaiguan District, from the city center. From 1985 to 2016 Shanhaiguan Airport also served as the civilian airport for Qinhuangdao. On 31 March 2016, the newly built Qinhuangdao Beidaihe Airport started operation and all civil flights were transferred to the new airport. History On 13 September 1971, Marshall Lin Biao, China's Vice Premier and Minister of Defense, attempted to flee China in his Hawker Siddeley Trident from Shanhaiguan Airport, allegedly following a failed coup attempt. The plane then crashed in Mongolia, killing all nine people on board, including Lin, his wife Ye Qun, and their son Lin Liguo. Shanhaiguan Airport was opened to civil flights on 15 April 1985. During its three decades of operation, it operated flights to more than 20 Chinese cities. For a time starting in 2007, it temporarily operated international flights to Yakutsk and Blagoveshchensk in Russia. Throughout the thirty years the airport maintained a perfect safety record. Although Shanhaiguan Airport was expanded in preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, its status as a military airport limited its potential for further growth. As a result, the new Qinhuangdao Beidaihe Airport was proposed in 2004, and received approval from the State Council in July 2009. Construction for the new airport officially began in April 2012, and was completed in 2016. On 31 March 2016, Beidaihe Airport started operation, and all civil flights were transferred to the new airport. Shanhaiguan Airport reverted to sole military use, although there are plans to use it for general aviation. In 2015, its last full year of operation, Shanhaiguan Airport served 156,000 passengers. Facilities The airport has a single runway that is long (class 4C). It can handle mid-sized passenger jets such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus 320. It has six aircraft parking aprons, and 200 car parking spaces.

Coldingham Priory was founded in the reign of David I of Scotland, although his older brother and predecessor King Edgar of Scotland had granted the land of Coldingham to the Church of Durham in 1098, and a church was constructed by him and presented in 1100 AD. The first prior is on record by the year 1147, although an earlier foundation is almost certain. The monastic cell was a dependent of Durham until the 1370s, and in 1378 King Robert II of Scotland expelled the Durham monks; for the following century the cell had two priors, one chosen by Durham and one chosen by the Scots. It became a dependent of Dunfermline Abbey. It was subject to increasingly secular control from the late 15th century into the 16th century. The following is a list of priors and commendators: List of priors * Edward, fl. 1124 x 1153Known only as monachus de Coldingham, but the fact he occurs three times in high circles means he was probably head of the monastery. * H.[...], fl. 1147 x 1150 * Sampson, fl. x 1159-1161 x 1162 * Alan, fl. 1165 x 1173 * Herbert, 1172x1174-1175 * Bertram, 1188-1189Became Prior of Durham. * Simon, 1189 x 1203 * Radulf, x 1203-x 1307 * Ernald, x 1207-1208 x 1211 * Thomas, 1212-1221 x * Radulf, 1218 x 1234 * Thomas de Melsonby, 1229-1234Became Prior of Durham. * Anketin, 1239-1242 * Bertram de Mediltone, 1242 x 1244 * Richard, x 1245-1247 or 1248 * Henry de Sylton, 1248-1260 * German, 1260 * Roger de Wolviston, 1263-1274 x 1276 * Henry de Horncastre, 1276-1296 * William de Midilton, 1304 * William de Gretham, 1304-1305 * Adam de Pontefract, 1309-1311 * William de Gretham, 1311-1321 * Richard de Whitworth, 1322-1325 * Adam de Pontefract, 1325-1332 * Robert de Graystanes, 1333 * Alexander de Lamsley, 1334 * William de Scaccario, 1336 x 1337 * Alexander de Lamsley, 1338-1339 * John Fossour, 1340-1341 * Walter de Skaresbrekis, 1341-1354 * William de Bamburgh, 1355-1362 * Robert Berrington de Walworth, 1363-1374 * Robert de Claxton, 1374 x 1379 List of priors with allegiance to Durham * Robert de Claxton, 1374-1391 * John de Ayclif, 1392-1416 * William Drax, 1418-1441 * John Oil, 1441-1447 * Thomas Nesbitt, 1447-1456 * John Pencher, 1456-1465 x 1467 * Thomas Haughton, 1467 * Thomas Wren, 1470 List of priors with allegiance to Dunfermline * Adam de Carale, 1374 x 1379 * Michael de Inverkeithing, 1379-1389 * William Reid, 1389-1390 ** Simon Marischal, 1389 * John Steele, 1390-1402 * Alan de Lyn, 1402 * Richard Mongal, 1402-1409 * Andrew Raburn, 1409-1414 x 1418 * Robert Bowmaker, 1419 * William Brown, 1419-1430 * Stephen Bryg, 1432 * William Boyce, 1442-1445 List of prior-commendators * Patrick Home, 1461-1478Also Archdeacon of Teviotdale. * John Home, 1464-1503 * Ninian Home, 1501-1508 * John Home, 1509 * Alexander Stewart, 1510-1513Also Archbishop of St Andrews (1504-1513). * David Home, 1513-1517 ** Thomas Nudre, 1514 * Robert Blackadder, 1518-1519 * William Douglas, 1519 -1526Becomes Abbot of Holyrood. ** George Patricii, 1520 ** Patrick Blackadder of Tulliallan, 1521 -1525Administered the cell as Archdeacon of Glasgow. ** Andrew Home, 1522 ** John Forman, 1523 * Adam Blackadder, 1523-1541 * John Stewart, Commendator of Coldingham, 1541-1563Illegitimate son of James V of Scotland: see Stewart, John (1531-1563) (DNB00 * Francis Stewart, earl of Bothwell, 1565-1567Was two years old. * John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, 1567-1571 * Alexander Home I [senior], 1570 * Alexander Home II [junior], 1571-1587 * Francis Stewart, earl of Bothwell (again), 1584-1590 * John Stewart, 1589-1592 * Alexander Home, 6th Lord Home, 1592-1606 Notes References * Cowan, Ian B. & Easson, David E., Medieval Religious Houses: Scotland With an Appendix on the Houses in the Isle of Man, Second Edition, (London, 1976), pp. 55–6 * Watt, D.E.R. & Shead, N.F.

Where it is successfully used, it will improve profitability through generating higher prices without impacting greatly on sales volumes. The approach is most successful when products are sold based on emotions (fashion), in niche markets, in shortages (e.g. drinks at open air festival on a hot summer day) or for complementary products (e.g. printer cartridges, headsets for cell phones). Goods which are very intensely traded (e.g. oil and other commodities) are often sold using cost-plus pricing. Goods which are sold to highly sophisticated customers in large markets (e.g. automotive industry) have also in the past been sold using cost-plus pricing, but thanks to modern pricing software and pricing systems and the ability to capture and analyze market data, more and more markets are migrating towards market- or value-based pricing. Value-based pricing in its literal sense implies basing pricing on the product benefits perceived by the customer instead of on the exact cost of developing the product. For example, a painting may be priced as much more than the price of canvas and paints: the price in fact depends a lot on who the painter is. Painting prices also reflect factors such as age, cultural significance, and, most importantly, how much benefit the buyer is deriving. Owning an original Dalí or Picasso painting elevates the self-esteem of the buyer and hence elevates the perceived benefits of ownership. Value-based versus cost-based pricing Price should be controlled within the value of the benefits that one business provides for its customer, while at the same time considering the price that their competitors' charge. Thus, prices are to be set according to the value that the business provides for its customer. To maximize the profitability of the products sold by the business, the business has to measure the benefit of the product that they provide to their customers, survey the criteria for the customers' buying decision (speed of delivery, convenience or reliability, etc.) and also identify the value of the benefits provided to the customer. =Cost-plus pricing= Cost-plus pricing is an approach which takes the total cost of producing the product or service and adding some amount to allow the business to make a profit. For example, in a retail store, if a merchant buys something for $5, and they sell it for $10 to a customer, this is called cost- based pricing. However, the willingness for the customer to pay is limited by the benefits they can receive: \\"Benefits are net benefits, where any cost that the customer firm incurs in obtaining the sought benefits, apart from purchase price, are included\\" (Anderson and Wynstra, 2010,31). Thus, the customer- perceived value is different between the net benefit they received and the price the customer paid, the supplier will not make any profit if the products are sold below the cost. =Value-based pricing= Value-based pricing is defined based on the value that a product or service can deliver to a predefined segment of customers which are the main factor for setting prices (Hinterhuber, 2008, 42), as value-based pricing depends on the strength of benefits that a company can prove and offer to their customers. Thus, value is the most important driving force in every business decision as value focuses on the price the potential customers are willing to pay based on the benefit offered by the business.Price your product or service: The difference between cost and value http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?type=RESOURCES&itemId;=1073790695 A benefit is typically meant in regards to achieving specific business goals. If the offered product or service helps to achieve these goals, it is typically valued higher. The foundation of value-based pricing is therefore to understand the customers' goals and the values used to achieve these goals.Value-Based Pricing by Michael Sonst. http://sonsts.de/blog/value-based- pricing/ For example, the cost for fixing a pipe at a customer's home for a plumber is $17.50 with the cost of travel, material cost and an hour's labour. However, the plumber may decide to charge a total of $50 to benefit from this business. Thus, the customer might not be happy about the overcharged price given by the plumber, at the same time there are possibility that the plumber will lose their customer, so it is important to measure the value of a product before setting the price too high. On the other hand, if the company has a clear-defined benefit that gives you an advantage over the competitor, the company is able to charge according to the value that is offered to the customers. Thus, this is a very profitable approach as it can break off potential customers who are driven only by price and also attract new customers from competitors. For example, Starbucks raised prices to maximize profits from price insensitive customers who depend on their gourmet coffee while losing customers who wanted cheaper prices to McDonald's., Will the Hard-core Starbucks customer pay more?. = Comparison with cost-based pricing = Several factors affect customer willingness to pay certain prices; for example, the difference of needs between countries, individual customers needs and wants, and the usual customer facing different occasions (actual and present needs) - hence a plan to suit all time value-based pricing is impossible. An extreme focus on value might leave the customer feeling exploited, leading to negative affect towards the company. In the long term, prices based on value-based pricing are always higher or equal to the prices taken from cost-based pricing - if the prices were any lower, the customer might perceive the actual value to be lower than the cost of producing the good plus a profit margin. Companies will not be interested in producing and selling the product at that price in the long term. Despite being difficult in implementation of both pricing techniques on companies, there should be consideration of values on products and market positioning brought out to the customers in the early stage of product development. Implementation = Resolving competing objectives = The conceptualization of sales strategy (Panagopoulos and Avlonitis, 2010)N.G. Panagopoulos, G.J. Avlonitis (2010). Performance implications of sales strategy: The moderating effects of leadership and environment. International Journal of Research in Marketing, 27 (1) (2010), pp. 46–57 is an essential for companies to sell in a more strategic way rather than operationally selling their products. However, the focus of B2B (business-to-business) pricing method has transformed into the concept of appreciating and raising the value of a product in a market, such as value creation and value capture (Aspara and Tikkanen, 2013).J. Aspara, H. Tikkanen (2013). Creating novel consumer value vs. capturing value: Strategic emphases and financial performance implications. Journal of Business Research, 66 (5) (2013), pp. 593–602 One of the reasons for some companies not applying value-based pricing is that they do not know their own advantages and capabilities. Next, the objectives of the company are not aligned. It is a typical conflict of objectives in companies is market share versus profitability, because in a business tradition, the higher your market share, the more profitable the company is. Hence, to implement value-based pricing into a company, the company has to understand its objective and the advantages that stand out among the competitors in the same field. Thus, this will provide a benefit of dominating the targeted market for the company, hence, sustaining the segmented customers that the company is targeting. = Understanding customer segmentation = There are many ways of approaching value-based pricing. However, segmentation between companies decides and affects which market segment the company is attracting or aiming for. Generally driving segments, there are customers who just go for the lowest price product, or value buyers who are willing to pay more to purchase products that are worth the price. Thus, value–based pricing companies are aiming for types of segmentation like value buyers. In reality, each and every product in the market is sold at different prices, for more or less similar products. However, selling the same product at different prices is often illegal, because it is regarded as price discrimination or treated as unfair. For example, if customer A and customer B purchased the same item but charged at different prices, this is perceived as unfair. Hence, two of the strategies to go around the market and still to charge more from one segment than another are price fencing and versioning. Price fences are criteria which customers must meet if they are to qualify for a lower priceHogan, J. and Nagle, T., Segmented pricing: using price fences to segment markets and capture value, accessed 30 October 2016 e.g. fencing price buyers from convenience buyers by offering a lower price to shoppers who use coupons found in local newspapers. A convenience buyer only goes to a store and purchase the product they want to get in full price. However, price buyer wants a low price, so they would clip out the coupon they got from the newspaper and redeem the coupon in the department store for a discount. Thus, fencing and versioning are just the ways of how we can address different segments with the willingness to pay at different price point. By capturing the willingness to pay from price buyers with a low-end offering, and at the same also segmenting convenience buyer. Thus, companies are able to charge a much higher price in convenience buyer segment, so profit increases by serving different segments in different price points. =Using pricing as pain management= However, coupons cannot be given out blindly before understanding which customers are willing to pay more when buying in large quantities. Periodically, some marketers have eliminated their competitors by driving down cost or developing upsetting technologies (Paranikas, Whiteford, Tevelson and Belz, 2015).P. Paranikas, G. P. Whiteford, B. Tevelson, D. Belz. (2015). Harvard Business Review. Supply Chains: How to Negotiate with Powerful Suppliers. Thus, market has been segmented out to set up different levels of discounts. Although market has a list price but no one ever pays the full list price, in fact, price negotiation turns into discount negotiation. For instance, the biggest challenge faced by market nowadays is giving too many discounts without getting anything in return. This proven that pricing is often a pain management, where when customer ask for discount or to purchase a product in lower price, customers have to give something back in return to get lower price or discounts. Hence, every discount should have a pain associated with it, because if customers do not suffer from the pain for asking to get a discount, they will just ask for more discounts. =Understanding price negotiation and fear= Price management and price psychology are related to each other.5 Psychological Studies on Pricing That You Absolutely MUST Read https://blog.kissmetrics.com/5-psychological-studies/ Companies often transform from a sole entrepreneur into a large company with multibillion-dollar contracts at stake, subject to both price anxiety and on the other hand price confidence. For example, when the buyer knows that the seller will win a deal at any cost, the seller will get it at any cost, meaning that the price will go down. Thus, in another way, the moment when the seller fears a price negotiation and on the other side there is an experienced buyer, the price will go down. It is often said that fear is the most expensive feeling in a company. Additionally, it is often seen that companies, salespersons, entrepreneurs, or freelancers are anxious to lose a deal when customer just takes the price down. Pricing confidence is an essential organizational characteristic which allows teams to sell the product confidently and believe in the price-worthy value of the product (Liozu et al., 2011).S.M. Liozu, R.J. Boland Jr., A. Hinterhuber, S. Perelli (2011). Industrial pricing orientation: The organizational transformation to value- based pricing. Paper presented at the International Conference on Engaged Management Scholarship, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (June 2011) Therefore, it is important that companies build up pricing confidence in a team, showing the team a better insight, creating more value from the product. Furthermore, this leads to price confidence that leads from the confidence a seller has in the product they are selling. However, when the seller is not confident about the price or product they are selling, help from others to access your product that has the value for the price is possible as well, and this leads to commodization. Commodization happens when the product a seller offer is as good or as bad as the competitor is offering. In these scenarios, the seller will find it difficult to sell the product at a higher price. Customers often use commodization to drive down the price of a product during a negotiation. Thus, it is valuable to the seller to convince the buyer that the product is not a commodity when you understand the value and that the price of the product is justified.Value-Based Pricing with Stefan Michel. http://www.lynda.com/Business-Enterprise-Marketing-tutorials/Value-Based- Pricing/195827-2.html =Addressing the mindset change= Value-based Pricing is as much about a change in mindset, as it is about the underlying mechanics of establishing a price and the sales skills needed to achieve the price in the market. The most important first step in Value-based pricing is to address the mindset change, so that the entire commercial organization starts to think about selling value instead of just selling a product. Companies with most successful VBP initiatives invest the time upfront to build a unified view across their commercial functions on some fundamental questions like ‘What is Value?’ and ‘How do we quantify Value?’ Answers to such questions are very specific and unique to each B2B company depending on what it sells, where it sells, who it sells to and how does it sell. A proven approach The 6Ws of value-based pricing in B2B https://b2bgrowthconsulting.com/2019/10/07/vbpinb2b/ is for companies to conduct a cross-functional workshop that involves not just the Product and the Marketing teams but also the Sales and Customer Service teams to build a company specific view on Value-based Pricing.

Armsby and George Armsby) (10 August 1876 in Evanston, Illinois – 24 March 1942 in New York City, New York) was an American entrepreneur, most noted for his drive toward corporate mergers in the first half of the 20th century: first the merger of California food companies that resulted in California Packing Corporation, which sold under the Del Monte and Sunkist labels. Armsby was on the board of numerous corporations, including Curtiss-Wright (where he served as Chairman), Universal Pictures, Bancamerica-Blair, and many others. He was associated throughout his business life with John Cheever Cowdin, with whom he ran Universal Pictures; they were also both involved in the formation of Transcontinental Air Transport, Inc., which was later a foundation of TWA. Early life Armsby was the son of food-packing entrepreneur James Kendall Armsby. His younger sister was golfer Cornelia Wicker Armsby. He went to work for his father's concern, J.K. Armsby Co., and on 28 December 1898 he married Leonora Chestnut Wood, daughter of Colorado mining entrepreneur Tingley Sylvanus Wood. California Packing Corporation In the mid-1910s he conceived a plan to unite California's food-packing companies under a single association, and he went to New York to secure the $16,000,000 in financing necessary to do it. Blair & Co. and William Salomon & Co. lent him the funds, and California Packing Corporation was founded. Blair-Salomon After serving on the Priorities Commission of the War Industries Board, her persuaded his two lenders on the CalPack deal to merge and he went to work for the new concern, Blair & Co., Inc. In time, the new enterprise was bought by Transamerica, and Armsby found himself working under his friend and fellow fruit-grower Amadeo Giannini. In time, this link would prove crucial to Armsby's next venture. Bank of America-Blair After playing a role in the construction of 40 Wall Street, for a time the world's tallest building and now The Trump Building, Armsby and Cowdin persuaded Giannini's Bank of America to merge with Blair, which became - in 1931, in the depths of the Great Depression - a major force on Wall Street. Personal life As his business ventures soared, Armsby's personal life was no less colorful. His marriage to Leonora disintegrated, and in March 1929 she sued for and was granted a divorce in the San Francisco courts, alleging (as was common at the time with unhappy spouses) that Armsby had abandoned her in New York in 1924. The subsequent divorce settlement of $1,000,000 made the papers as far away as Helena, Montana. Notably, Leonora retained the Armsby name until her death in 1962. Armsby's personal life made the papers next year when, in March 1930, he announced that he was marrying, at age 54, a 36-year-old woman, Colette Touzeau, whom the N.Y. Times and other papers tartly (if apparently accurately) called an ex show-girl. They did marry that month, in Los Angeles, and remained together until Armsby's death twelve years later. Later years Armsby's business life showed no sign of slowdown as he went into the 1940s. He remained involved with Curtiss-Wright and Universal Pictures, in fact was a defendant in an anti-trust case against the movie industry in the late 1930s. His death in 1942 was sudden, and the newspaper coverage paid tribute to his vast network of business activity and connections.

Retrieved 2013-02-05. is an estuary located in the Outer Banks, North Carolina, United States that separates Ocracoke Island and Portsmouth Island. It connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Pamlico Sound. It is the southern terminus of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, and the northern terminus of the Cape Lookout National Seashore. The inlet is approximately two miles across, although it changes daily. Map of Ocracoke and vicinity, ca 1775  History  Ocracoke was one of the first inlets made use of by colonists on North Carolina's Outer Banks, first host to a party of colonists who journeyed through it and up to Roanoke Island in 1585. It became the most important inlet for delivery of goods to the mainland, especially to New Bern and Bath. The pirate Captain Blackbeard was killed in battle just inside the inlet at what was subsequently known as Teach's Hole, on November 22, 1718. During the American Revolutionary War, many supplies that helped the Continental Army under General George Washington came through this inlet. It became so important that a town was established on the end of the southern island, Portsmouth Island, complementing the town of Ocracoke to the north. At one time, Portsmouth Island was the most densely populated place on the entire Outer Banks. However, after the Great Havana Hurricane of 1846, when Hatteras Inlet and Oregon Inlet opened, Ocracoke Inlet lost its prominence. Extensive shoaling made the commercial boats travel to deeper inlets. In A New Voyage to Carolina, published in 1709, John Lawson (explorer) wrote: > Ocacock is the best Inlet and Harbour yet in this Country; and has 13 Foot > at Low-water upon the Bar.

Grammy-winning singer/songwriter Dave Matthews guest stars in the episode as Patrick, a savant and piano prodigy who comes under the care of Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) for a rare movement disorder. Dr. House also is suspected to have cancer by his staff. Also appearing is Kurtwood Smith. The episode marks the directorial debut of executive producer Katie Jacobs. Plot Patrick Obyedkov, a respected pianist, suffers a painful involuntary muscle contraction in his left hand during a piano concert. The case attracts the attention of House, who learns from Patrick's father that Patrick suffered severe brain damage from a bus accident that also killed his mother. House is intrigued as to why Patrick, who had no musical training at the time of the accident, could suddenly play the piano flawlessly after suffering a severe injury. While trying to deduce the origin of the brain rewiring responsible for Patrick's mysterious gift of music, House and his team must stop the deadly bleeding that is quickly threatening his life. Patrick's condition worsens, and House presents a difficult option to Patrick's father: either perform a hemispherectomy, allowing Patrick to live normally but not play the piano, or to continue as he is and never live a normal life. Patrick's father, after overcoming his anger at the suggestion, opts for the surgery. After the procedure, Patrick loses his ability to speak, though House says this will return. While the father is talking with House about his son's recovery, Patrick buttons his shirt, a task which he had previously been incapable of doing. Meanwhile, Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) discovers that House has been in contact with a hospital in Massachusetts and suspects that House may be looking to take a new job there. When Cuddy contacts the hospital, she learns that House has been in contact with a brain cancer specialist — not as a job applicant, but as a patient for a clinical trial. When confronted by his team, House denies the gravity of the situation and resents their interference, and they are forced to contend with the possibility his condition may be more serious than he's letting on. Near the end of the episode, the team discovers that the medical file sent to the hospital in Massachusetts did not belong to House, and he intended to trick the doctors at the university into implanting a \\"cool drug\\" into the pleasure center of his brain, possibly in order to get over the pain in his leg.

The station was started by Radio New Zealand (which at the time was known as the National Broadcasting Service) in the 1960s as Radio Lakeland on 1500AM with the call sign 1ZA. Radio Lakeland also broadcast in Turangi on 1390AM with the call sign 1ZT. In 1978 after AM band in New Zealand was changed from 10 kHz spacing to 9 kHz spacing the Taupo station moved to 1494AM and the Turangi station moved to 1386AM. In 1988 the station began broadcasting on 96.7FM in Taupo with the AM frequency later being taken over by National Radio in 1989. In 1988 the station ceased broadcasting in Turangi but later returned on 89.6FM and then moved to 92.4FM. The station became known on air as Lakeland FM in 1989. In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, the sale included Lakeland FM. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. In 1998 The Radio Network grouped all their local stations in smaller markets together to form the Community Radio Network. Lakeland FM became the host of the Community Radio Network, Lakeland FM and all other stations retained their local identity and ran a local breakfast show followed by networked programming from the Lakeland FM Taupo studios. In 2000 the relay to Turangi (92.4FM) was replaced with Radio Hauraki but listeners in Turangi could now tune to the Taupo frequency (96.7FM) to hear Lakeland FM. In 2001 the Community Radio Network was discontinued and all stations became part of the Classic Hits FM network, as a result, Lakeland FM was rebranded as Classic Hits Lakeland FM. The station continued to run a local breakfast but now outside of breakfast all programming originated from the Classic Hits studios in Auckland, as a result, the Taupo-based shows were discontinued. In 2010, the station adjusted its frequency to 96.8FM as part of the NZ Government's change of FM frequencies. The station became known as Classic Hits 96.8. In 2014 all stations on the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. As a result, the station became known as The Hits 96.8. The rebrand of the station coincided with a change in the station lineup including a networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama. Most regions had their former breakfast announcer move to a newly introduced local 9 am – 3 pm timeslot. For Taupo, the change meant the end of all local programming on the station as now between 9 am and 3 pm The Hits in Taupo shares the same programming as The Hits Rotorua with Paul Hickey presenting this show from Rotorua.

These systems simulate and amplify bell sounds which are then played from loudspeakers housed in a bell tower. Due to the costs associated with installing, maintaining, and operating traditional carillons, many churches and universities now use these types of systems. Bell Sound Emulation While a traditional carillon uses actual bells, electronic systems simulate a bell sound in several ways * By striking semantra (rectangular metal bars roughly the diameter of a pencil, but of varying lengths) with an electric solenoid. * By striking tubular bells similarly * By playing back a previously recorded bell sound * By striking a small number of actual bells in combination with the methods above Operation Electronic carillons use internal electronic clocks to determine when chimes or music will be played. The Westminster Quarters are commonly programmed to chime the hour and its divisions, along with musical selections. The musical score is stored on media which can typically be changed or expanded. Systems may also provide a keyboard or console. This allows a musician to operate the instrument in a manner similar to the way a traditional carillon is operated. These keyboards are sometimes integrated with or attached to an organist's console. Early automated carillons used electric timers that simply played selected bell strikes or tunes. Modern computerized carillons can be programmed to play selections for Easter, as well as other fixed and movable holidays. Since these systems use an amplifiers and loudspeakers, many are being expanded to also provide emergency notification systems to college campuses.

Bajitpur was created by Baizid Kha. It was previously a part of greater Mymensingh district, currently falls under the Dhaka Division. The place is well known to Bangladeshis and people of West Bengal for being the ancestral home, birthplace, and the place of growing up and sadhana of Swami Pranavananda Maharaj (1896–1941), the yogi, spiritual leader and Hindu revivalist leader who founded the Bharat Sevashram Sangha. History During the British period the naval port of Dilalpur of this upazila became famous. Indigo centres were established at Gopinathpur and Ghoraghat. Consignments of pearl of the Bhati region were made from these areas. Bajitpur was created by Baizid Kha. The Fakir-Sanyasi revolts extensively spread over Bajitpur. During the war of liberation the Muktibahinis liberated Bajitpur on 26 October after defeating occupant Pak army. Seven freedom fighters were killed in encounters with the Pakistan army. Pak army killed about 400 innocent people and 60 women lost their sanctity. =Fine quality muslin= Bajitpur was known for the production of fine quality muslin, called tanjab. The art of making Jamdani designs on fine fabric reached its zenith during Mughal rule. There were handlooms in almost all villages of dhaka district. Bajitpur among Dhaka, Sonargaon, Dhamrai, Titabari and Jangalbari were famous for making superior quality Jamdani and muslin. Traders from Europe, Iran, Armenia, as well as Mughal-Pathan traders used to deal in these fabrics. The Mughal Emperor, the Nawab of Bengal and other aristocrats used to engage agents at Dhaka to buy high quality muslin and Jamdani from the above-mentioned selected places for their masters use. After the liberation of Bangladesh, a Jamdani village was established at Demra near Dhaka to provide financial support to weavers. Jamdani weavers of other areas, however, suffer from lack of patronage and support of their labour and expertise. The silent looms of village Madhurapur in bajitpur upazila of kishoreganj district speak volumes about the decline of this industry. This village was once famous for producing Jamdani cloth and fancy textiles with yarn of 100/300 counts. Geography Bajitpur is located at . It has 35051 households and total area 193.76 km².

The name was coined by Jared Diamond in 1974, as an allusion to both the itinerant lifestyle of the tramp, and the then-popular band Supertramp.

Early life Shorrock was born Eccles Shorrock Ashton to Thomas Ashton and Mary Ashton in Clitheroe, Lancashire and named after his uncle, the first Eccles Shorrock, who had purchased the Bowling Green Mill in Darwen from the Carrs in 1830. Shorrock was eleven years old when his uncle had thrown his Queen Victoria's Coronation Celebrations, a dinner celebration that lasted from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. when his 1,400 work employees and tenants consumed 3,300 pounds of roast beef and plum pudding and drank 220 gallons of nut brown ale. The entire dinner celebration was filled with jubilation. In 1829, Shorrock's mother died just two weeks after giving birth to his brother Ralph, leaving Thomas Ashton a widower with two young sons, the toddler Shorrock and the infant Ralph. Thomas Ashton soon remarried and with that new marriage came Shorrock and Ralph's half-brother William, causing Thomas to decide to give up his first two children. They were taken in and raised by Mary's brother Eccles Shorrock who had means and resources to do so and made the decision to formally adopt Shorrock and Ralph. Because of Shorrock's uncle's great charity and officially taking in him and his brother Ralph as sons, Eccles Shorrock Ashley decided to unofficially drop the surname Ashton and change his name to Eccles Shorrock II, Shorrock's uncle made certain the boys had a good education and sent them to the Hoole's Academy in Blackburn for their formative years. After the Hoole's Academy Shorrock and Ralph were privately tutored and entered University College, London. Early adult life Low Hill House, Darwen On April 23, 1851, Eccles Shorrock married Sarah Dimmock. In 1853, Shorrock's uncle died without a natural born heir despite two marriages and therefore bequeathed Shorrock his estate. Shorrock moved into his uncle's home, Low Hill House in Darwen (originally built for Samuel Crompton) and took over his uncle's mills in Darwen, including Darwen Mill and New Mill. Eccles Shorrock was only twenty-six years old when he received his uncle's inheritance and his company. He immediately took in his brother Ralph and his half-brother William as partners in the business. One year after taking over the India Mill Company Shorrock had expanded the firm's operations to papermaking, a coal-pit, and a sawmill. Following the success of his businesses he decided to build another mill, calling it Hope Mill and giving it to his cousin W.T. Ashton. From this point on Shorrock's civic duties, public speaking, business interests and family life would be an important element in the industrial expansion of East Lancashire. Shorrock had taken up the particular civic duty of being elected to the Local Board of Health. In 1855 he had been made a Justice of the Peace in Darwen and in 1858 become the Chairman of the Darwen Health Board. Before the end of the 1850s he was an active participant in all educational matters in the town of Darwen, including being Chairman of the Mechanic's Institute a good number of times. In 1856 he came to a formal agreement with his family members on matters of positions and remuneration with the \\"New Article For Ten Year Partnership\\". In 1859 work commenced on building the current India Mill, although it would be 1871 before the mill would be ready for production. The 1860s India Mill The 1860s was a difficult time for Eccles Shorrock and his India Mill Company and proved to be a definitive decade for both of them. The decade started with the American Civil War which had an effect not only on Shorrock and his India Mill Company but also on the entire cotton trade/milling industry. This effect was due to the fact that the whole of the Southern United States was dominated by cotton farming and production and during the war the production of cotton fell because of the Confederate States of America's focus on military production. Certain trade embargoes also lead to a considerable reduction in the export of cotton from the United States. The lack of American cotton lead to a large influx of Indian cotton, which was of a significantly lesser quality and yet still more expensive because of transportation expenses. The lack of American cotton had caused the price of Indian cotton to skyrocket. Shorrock luckily had purchased plenty of American cotton to fill his reserves at the beginning of the war and there was no need for him to pay a 300% increase in cotton prices. Cotton reserves meant that Shorrock was able to weather the storm of the \\"Cotton Famine\\" when other cotton mill companies which had not taken similar precautions at the start of the war were forced to suffer. Eccles Shorrock's uncle had opened the William Street School for the purpose of educating people who had lost their job in the cotton mill industry in new trades, believing that the William Street School would combat unemployment problems in the town of Darwen and the larger area. In 1862, the numbers of those whom needed assistance in the William Street School and under the Darwen Relief Fund that Shorrock had founded went from 600 at the start of the year to 3000 at the end. Eccles Shorrock had personally donated 1000 British Pounds to the Darwen Relief Fund . In 1862, Eccles Shorrock and many others that were a part of the Darwen Relief Fund donated 2000 Christmas dinner tickets to the unemployed and needy. In tandem with the Darwen Relief Fund the Lord of the local Manor, William Duckworth, donated the money for an addition 2000 Christmas dinner tickets to match Shorrock and the relief fund. The economic casualties from the Queensland Cotton Growing Company were invited to the assembly room in 1863; the address to these people was headed with the title \\"Emigration or Starvation!\\". Despite the despair that the Cotton Famine caused by the American Civil War had inflicted on the English cotton mill industry, Eccles Shorrock and the India Mill Company were able to prosper during and after this period. In the mid-1860s the new India Mill was completed with its mock campanile chimney. The India Mill Company's building and chimney would be and is looked at as a symbol of prosperity and productiveness for the town of Darwen as it stands as the greatest monument the town has to offer. It is also worth stating that the chimney was not completed without daring and bold actions by the common man. As was accounted in the \\"Blackburn Times\\" on October 1, 1864, Briggs Knowles had volunteered to climb the height of the chimney to untangle and free the rope that was used to bus the materials (in a box) at the top of the chimney in progress. Knowles had climbed the chimney without any safety measures other than his own sure-handedness and his wits. Knowles was successful in his attempt and Shorrock had awarded him 20 shillings. As evidence to the aforementioned the building became a symbol for prosperity in the town of Darwen because the town and the India Mill Company was seemingly at its height in the realm of commerce. An 1867 table of works in Darwen projected extremely positive numbers for the town and the India Mill Company; unemployment in Darwen had drastically improved from the years of 1861–1864. In Darwen's table of works in 1867 it also showed that the Shorrocks had 32 cotton weaving works that were employing approximately 7000 individuals producing over 28,550,000 pounds of cloth per annum. Eccles Shorrock and the India Mill Company's enjoyed great success and recognition for its new building and iconic chimney. There were many social gatherings and dinners that had been arranged in the new building to celebrate holidays and special occasions; including—initially after—the completion of the building itself. In May 1868, Shorrock had been able to commission the Art Treasures Exhibit to be held at the India Mill Company building in Darwen. Shorrock and his more philanthropic intentions had hoped that the funds that would be procured from hosting such an event would be substantial enough to build a new Belgrave Congressional School. The Art Treasure Exhibit at the India Mill Company building was considered to be gigantic and epic. Not only did the people from all over the county of Lancashire come to the exhibit but from all over the North Western region of England came to see the exhibit in Darwen.Eccles Shorrock; cotton town; Mary Painter; 2003 Post 1860s Eccles Shorrock came out of the 1860s a success in everything he lent himself towards; this considering the great adversities that had befallen him during the decade. Despite all of these trials that he had to face he had pretty much made his legacy and the India Mill Company was on a strong footing to start the 1870s. By 1871 the India Mill had been equipped with machinery and could start production. An 1871 census record of the Low Hill estate read that Eccles Shorrock was the landowner, cotton spinning and manufacturer that employs 630 males, 652 Women, 122 males under 13, 102 females under 13 for a total of 1,505 employees to the India Mill Company. By 1876, these census figures would have certainly increased at a significant amount. In May 1874, there was full-time working and ever increasing sales which made it the perfect time for Eccles Shorrock to found his new cotton mill company \\"India Mills (Darwen) Cotton Spinning Company\\". Also during this year Eccles Shorrock had been elected as the chairman of the \\"North East Liberal Association\\", this experience had greatly influenced Shorrock and piqued his interest in matters of politics. During Shorrock's time with the North East Liberal Association he had the opportunity to make acquaintance and connection with many prominent people in the \\"Liberal Party\\"; for instance he had made contact with Lord Cavendish whom would later succeed Gladstone as the leader of their party. Eccles Shorrock and the India Mills Cotton Spinning Company would get through to 1876 successfully but 1877 was a different story. In 1877, a recession hit England and this time Shorrock and the India Mills would not dodge the financial stresses that lay ahead. The recession was the result of a number of things: firstly, the Russo-Turkish War had ignited that year and destabilized the economy, not only England but in all of Europe, next there was discontent over taxation within England that caused businesses and investors to be wary about taking risks, and lastly the Import/Export duties that the English manufacturers had to endure was not helping the situation. England imposed no tariffs on goods imported from France but France had imposed excruciatingly high tariffs on English goods. This of course had negatively effected Shorrock and the India Mills Cotton Spinning Company along with other entire industries within England. By July 1877, Eccles Shorrock's India Mills Cotton Spinning Company was in an apparent decline and facing major difficulties. On August 18, 1877, the \\"Darwen News\\" published an article that painted a picture of the company's apparent distress. The article forwarded some sympathies and hopes for the Company's recovery, noting that the company and its people \\"demonstrates a general conviction of high character and honourable conduct\\".Editorial; Darwen News; August 18, 1877 That said the article believed that the company would weather the current economic uncertainties and \\"retain its important position as a large employer of labour in Darwen\\".Editorial; Darwen News; August 18, 1877 By 1878, the situation and economic distress that the India Mills Cotton Spinning Company was suffering had got worse. In fact, the economic downturn suffered by the community of Darwen made the previous problems caused by the cotton famine during the American Civil War seemed inconsequential. Employees in the industry were being laid off and wages were temporarily cut by 10%. The millworkers started to protest, but the protests turned violent and very quickly the protesters became rioters. Eccles Shorrock was negatively effected by the rioting, the workers suffering being due as he saw it to his company's failures. During this time was the first evidence of Shorrock's drop in his prowess as a business leader and in his health. Shorrock was advised by his doctor to leave all the commotion behind and go abroad. Shorrock was only sent abroad for a short period of time just to avoid and get away from the rioters and their disruptions and destruction. However Eccles Shorrock's absence from Darwen didn't stop the riots from happening in Darwen and Blackburn. The unrest would continue not only there but in all of the cotton districts of England, starting in 1878 and only ending in 1880. Family fallout There was now evidence that there was discontent and conflict between Eccles Shorrock and his two brothers Ralph and William; the antagonism between the three brothers was reported by the Darwen News in August 1880. Ralph Shorrock and William Ashton were both interested in bringing in receivers to liquidate the company but Eccles Shorrock had been adamantly opposed to the idea. In August 1880 Ralph Shorrock and William Ashton both sought an injunction from the High Court in London to put an end to Eccles Shorrock's interference with their interests. However, Eccles Shorrock disregarded the court injunction and evaded the London authorities by returning to Lancashire. In September 1880, Darwen News had reported that Eccles Shorrock had ordered the company to seize operations and extinguish the boilers in the mill, bringing the mill's production on an indefinite halt. Charles Costeker, the town clerk for Darwen, informed Shorrock that he would have to appear in front of the High Court in London to answer for the injunction, and that if he did not change his \\"stance\\" that he would be held in contempt of court and imprisoned. Shorrock had decided to ignore Charles Costeker's letter and did not heed the warning that it contained. Shorrock had also ordered the stopping of payments made to all the wages and accounts. Hehad also told the bank not to recognize Ralph Shorrock and William Ashton's signatures and told the postman not to deliver any letters and messages to anyone but himself. These actions had dire consequences for Eccles Shorrock and his brothers; the family ultimately became split over the issue. On August 23, 1880, Ralph Shorrock had stated in an affidavit that he had completely given up on any possibility of the partnership with his brother (Eccles Shorrock) to continue and that he had serious doubts about his sanity. A little later on August 28, 1880, William Ashton had stated in an affidavit that the New Mill which had 840 looms and 40,000 spindles and Darwen Mill with 50,000 spindles had also been stopped. Eccles Shorrock was hurried out of Darwen one Saturday morning in September 1880 to catch a 10:27 a.m. train in order to avoid his workers who got off at 12:30 p.m. and the press. The Darwen News reported on 18 September 1880 on Eccles Shorrock's departure from the town: \\"...taken to the station with his legs dangling out of the cab, by an indirect route, so as to avoid publicity.\\"Darwin News; 18 September 1880 Shorrock was designated to be received at the Holloway Prison where he would reside for four months. He was released earlier than expected based on condition that he would stay away from the town of Darwen for at least four months. After Shorrock's family had disowned him and Darwen had ousted him, he never returned to his former glory in matters of business and local respect. Shorrock's finances and fortunes would take an inevitable decline after being released from prison; and as expected...his health would accompany his fortunes in their demise. He wrote a pamphlet about his experiences in the prison.Eccles Shorrock; cotton town; Mary Painter; 2003 In 1887 his mental health finally gave way and he was admitted to Edinburgh asylum suffering from manic depression. Death and legacy Eccles Shorrock's grave, Darwen cemetery Eccles Shorrock died in the Edinburgh Asylum on 28 September 1889 and his body was taken back to Darwen to be buried in the family plot at Darwen Cemetery. Several of his children also suffered from similar mental issues. Shorrock's legacy stands today as a man whom was infinitely important to the cotton industry in England and paramount to the strong development of his home town of Darwen. Today Shorrock's India Mill building might be his biggest legacy. Still standing, with its tall chimney, it is a constant reminder of Darwen's industrial prosperity and heritage. The India Mill building today is privately owned and leases out spaces for local enterprises to carry out their business.

Although Delara initially claimed that she had committed the crime, she subsequently recanted and explained that her older boyfriend, Amir Hossein, had persuaded her to lie about the incident to protect him. According to Delara and other sources familiar with the case, Amir Hossein was the person who had committed the murder in an attempt to steal from a wealthy member of the Darabi family. Darabi served five years of a prison sentence for theft on death row after her conviction (In Iran, prisoners often have to serve time in prison before execution). She initially confessed, but later recanted, claiming her boyfriend, Amir Hossein, persuaded her to confess by convincing her that he would be executed (as she would not have been in most places, being a minor; but this was not the case in Iran). While on death row, Darabi, having developed a love of painting at an early age, completed several works that depicted her incarceration. In confinement, she also wrote poetry. Among her work is the poem entitled \\"Prison\\", a psychological and philosophical work on life in prison. A collection of her art was displayed at an exhibition in Tehran by supporters campaigning her release. Darabi's lawyer, Abdolsamad Khoramshahi, had appealed against the sentence, arguing that her conviction had been based solely on her confession and that her trial had failed to consider vital evidence. Biography Darabi was born in the northern city of Rasht, in the province of Gilan. Darabi was hanged in the morning of 1 May 2009. The news of her hanging was announced to the world by Iranian-American lawyer, Lily Mazahery, who posted the information on Twitter. Trial and sentence Darabi was tried by a lower court in Rasht, found guilty and sentenced to death. Her lawyer was Abdolsamad Khorramshahi. The sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court. She maintained her innocence, and claimed that she was under the influence of drugs during the burglary, despite making a confession and pleading guilty earlier. At this stage the Head of the Judiciary had the power to order a stay of execution and a review of the case. The boyfriend Amir Hossein has reportedly received a prison sentence of 10 years as an accessory to the crime. Amnesty International has made several public statements about Darabi. Darabi was a painter and wrote a few poems during her lifetime. She had used her paintings and poems to express her feelings. In 2008 there was an exhibition of her paintings in Tehran; a similar exhibition was held in Stockholm in April 2007. Darabi attempted suicide by cutting her wrists on 20 January 2007. However, her cellmate noticed and called for help. She was rushed to hospital, where she was revived. Petitions for clemency An online petition to save Delara from execution was drafted and circulated around the world. The petition appealed to Iranian authorities, particularly the country's head of judiciary, to observe international treaties and standards and to commute Delara's sentence. However, there was no way the judiciary could do so, since the victim's family demanded qisas, or retribution (the death penalty) rather than diyya, which is blood money. Amnesty International arranged for letters in support of Darabi to be sent to Iranian authorities. Background information As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Iran has entered into diplomatic commitments not to execute persons for offences committed when they were under 18. Nevertheless, since 1990, Iran has executed at least 18 people for crimes committed when they were juveniles. In 2005 alone, despite being urged in the January by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to suspend the practice immediately, at least eight juvenile offenders were executed, including two who were still under 18 at the time of their execution. Before Darabi's, the last recorded execution of a juvenile offender, Rostam Tajik, was on 10 December 2005. On 9 December, Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, stated: \\"At a time when virtually every other country in the world has firmly and clearly renounced the execution of people for crimes they committed as children, the Iranian approach is particularly unacceptable... it is all the more surprising because the obligation to refrain from such executions is not only clear and incontrovertible, but the Government of Iran has itself stated that it will cease this practice.\\" According to the penal code of the Islamic Republic of Iran, children are considered criminally responsible for their actions as adults at the age of puberty. Pursuant to Article 1210, Addendum 1, girls reach the age of puberty 6 years before their male counterparts, at age of 9. Boys, on the other hand, are not legally considered to have reached the maturity that would make them responsible for their actions, such as murder, until the age of 15. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say Iran executes the most juvenile offenders of any country, in breach of the UN Convention, which forbids the death penalty for crimes committed under the age of 18. Lawyers estimate 130 prisoners are on death row in Iran for murders committed as minors. Execution The head of the judiciary officially granted a two-month stay of execution, yet the go-ahead for her execution was given to Rasht prison authorities. Delara Darabi was executed at 5:00 AM local time on 1 May 2009 at Rasht Central Prison, without prior notification to her attorney and family. Just minutes before being hanged she was allowed to make a desperate last phone call to her parents, and she pleaded for them to save her, followed by the prison warden's voice informing her parents she was to be executed for her crimes immediately.

The play is \\"ranked by many critics as Shirley's ablest work in romantic comedy...It is a play notable for well-knit plot, effective scenes, pleasing characterization, clever dialogue, and poetic atmosphere.\\"Nason, pp. 292-3. The Royal Master was part of the Irish phase of Shirley's career (1637-40); it premiered on 1 January 1638 at the Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin, and was likely the first of Shirley's plays produced there (according to the dedication of the first edition). It also was given in a special performance at Dublin Castle. The play was published in quarto later that year, also in Dublin, by the booksellers Edmund Crooke and Thomas Allot. (Crooke was a relation of Andrew Crooke, the London stationer who issued a series of Shirley's plays in the later 1630s.)Crooke and his partner William Cooke published eleven Shirley plays in the 1637-40 period, and each man issued other Shirley plays on his own. The 1638 text is dedicated by Shirley to George Fitzgerald, 16th Earl of Kildare, and is prefaced by dedicatory poems, including one by John Ogilby, the founder of the Werburgh Street Theatre. The Epilogue extols both King Charles I and Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, the Lord Deputy of Ireland and Shirley's patron. The Royal Master was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company of London on 13 March 1638 and also licensed for London performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 23 April the same year. Synopsis The play is set in the Kingdom of Naples. Montalto, the King's favourite, wants to secure his influence by marrying Theodosia, the sister of the King -- which means that he must frustrate the proposed marriage of Theodosia to the Duke of Florence, the brother of the King's late queen. Montalto arranges a hunting party for the King and Duke, which pauses, by plan, at the country house of the noble widow Simphorosa. Montalto's plan is that the Duke will fall in love with Domitilla, the charming, fifteen-year-old daughter of the house. And to that extent his plan succeeds -- the Florentine Duke is much taken with the young woman. Also, Montalto quietly informs the Duke that Theodosia is already privately committed to another -- that being himself, Montalto. Still, the Duke hesitates to abandon the sister of a powerful monarch. Montalto informs Theodosia of the Duke's interest in Domitilla; he also hints to Riviero, the Duke's secretary, that Theodosia has already yielded her honor -- to him, Montalto. All this plotting comes to a head: the King reproaches the Duke for deserting Theodosia, the Duke complains of Theodosia's compromised honor, and Theodosia clashes with her brother and with Domitilla as well. Montalto tries to keep the mess from reaching him. The only link that can connect Montalto with the accusation against Theodosia is the secretary, Riviero. Montalto uses his power to keep both the secretary and the Duke from the King's presence. The King calls for his favorite; concerned that the rumors about Theodosia's compromised honor are true, the King wants to find some nobleman to marry her to control a possible scandal. Montalto volunteers. The King accepts him, but has a strange plan for showing his gratitude. The King orders Montalto and all his party of supporters into custody, and encourages all and sundry to present their complaints to the supposedly \\"disgraced\\" favorite. The royal scheme is that Montalto will soon be restored to favor with all his enemies revealed. But Montalto's plot against the duke, and other crimes as well, are demonstrated, with evidence in the favorite's handwriting. The court is amazed to find that the King still appears to favor his favorite. Montalto is brought back to the court -- only to face the accusations of his villainy and to be disgraced and condemned to death. Since this is a comedy, it turns out that a man Montalto is supposed to have had murdered is in fact alive, in disguise; he is Riviero, the Duke's secretary. Montalto's death sentence is commuted to banishment. (Because of this serious undercurrent, the play is sometimes classified as a tragicomedy.) The subplot involves Domitilla, and her infatuation with the King. The King at first plans to arrange a marriage between her and Montalto; the naive girl misunderstands him, and thinks the King has asked her to marry him. When the Duke shows his interest, she rejects him, thinking herself already committed; but this merely drives the Duke and Theodosia together. The girl's mother, Simphorosa, perceives her daughter's situation and asks the King to help resolve it. The King does so, by asking Domitilla to be not his wife but his mistress (a solicitation he makes only after he's certain she will refuse). The plan works, and Domitilla, her infatuation broken, becomes affianced to the noble young Octavio. Notes References * Forsythe, Robert Stanley.

The parish includes the hamlet of East End, and since 1932 has also included the hamlet of Wilcote. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,929. Early history Green Wood fort, about south of the village in the grounds of Eynsham Hall, is an Iron Age hill fort. The course of Akeman Street Roman road linking Cirencester with London forms part of the northern boundary of the parish. Two Roman villas have been excavated in the parish. One is about northwest of the centre of the village and is not on display. The other, known as North Leigh Roman Villa, is about north of East End. It is under the care of English Heritage and is open to the public. In 1928 the remains of eight Saxon burials from the 7th century AD were found less than north of the centre of the village. The toponym Leigh is also Saxon, derived from the Old English leah meaning a clearing. \\"North\\" distinguishes the village from South Leigh, less than to the south. In local dialect North Leigh is pronounced \\"Nor'Lye\\", and the parish newsletter is called the Nor'Lye News.Nor'Lye News Manor The Domesday Book of 1086 records that the Norman nobleman Roger d'Ivry held the manor of North Leigh. D'Ivry was a brother in arms of Robert D'Oyly who built Oxford Castle. Some of d'Ivry's manors, including North Leigh, became part of the honour of St Valery. In the 13th century the honour of St. Valery passed to the Earl of Cornwall, but when Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall died childless in 1300 it then passed to the Crown. Lieu-Dieu Abbey in the Somme area of northern France was founded in 1191, and shortly thereafter it was given the tenancy of North Leigh manor. In 1247 Lieu-Dieu sold the tenancy to the Cistercian Netley Abbey in Hampshire. In 1536 the Abbey was suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the tenancy of North Leigh passed to the Crown. In 1544 the Crown granted the manor to Sir Thomas Pope, with whose heirs it remained until a later Thomas Pope, the 3rd Earl of Downe sold it in 1660. From 1676 the manor belonged to the Perrott family, who had been linked with the Popes by marriage in the 16th century, and after whom Perrotts Hill Farm is named. Perrotts Hill farmhouse is 17th century or older, but was remodelled in the 18th and 19th centuries. Alabaster effigies of Sir William Wilcote (died 1410) and his wife In 1765 James Leigh-Perrott sold the manor of North Leigh to George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough. At the time the manor had of land, but over the years the Blenheim Estate sold parts of it until by 1984 it retained only about . Roger d'Ivry granted two thirds of the demesne tithes of the manor to St. George's church in Oxford Castle. In the 12th century St. George's church and its tithes passed to the Augustinian Osney Abbey in Oxford. In 1279 the remaining third of the tithes and an area of land in the parish were made over to the Cistercian Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire. Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall had founded Hailes Abbey in 1245 or 1246, and also owned North Leigh manor. From 1314 Hailes Abbey also leased Osney Abbey's tithes from North Leigh. In the Dissolution of the Monasteries the land and tithes of the abbeys were taken by the Crown. In 1544 the Crown granted the former Hailes land to three London citizens, and in 1555 one of them then granted it to the Bridewell Hospital in London. North Leigh parish was farmed under the open field system until 1759, when an Act of Parliament allowed their enclosure. Bridewell Hospital received two farms, one of which is Bridewell Farm. The Bridewell farmhouse was built in 1761. Churches St Mary's parish church from the west =Church of England= The bell tower of the Church of England parish church of Saint MarySt Mary's North Leigh is late Saxon, probably built in the first half of the 11th century. The building underwent a complex series of alterations from the 12th to the 18th centuries, losing its Saxon nave to the west of the tower and gaining at various times a new nave, chancel, aisles and two chapels east of the tower. St Mary's is particularly notable for its fan vaulted early 15th century Perpendicular Gothic style Wilcote chantry chapel and its early 18th century Perrott burial chapel, both of which are of unusually high quality for a village parish church. St Mary's former vicarage, rebuilt in 1726 The Gothic Revival architect GE Street restored St Mary's in 1864. The tower has a ring of six bells cast by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1875. Shortly after 1726 the vicarage just south of the church was demolished a new one was built. In 1811 a vicar complained that it was too small, so somewhen thereafter it was extended at the back. In 1981 the Diocese of Oxford decided the vicarage was too big and sold it. North Leigh Methodist Church, rebuilt in 1873 =Other denominations= A Quaker congregation was meeting in North Leigh by 1659 and in 1669 was reported to attract 60 or more people to its meetings. In 1738 North Leigh still had two Quaker families but by 1768 only one elderly man and his daughter remained. By 1770 villagers from North Leigh were attending Weslayan meetings in the area. The Wesleyan congregation seems to have had a chapel in Chapel Lane by the 1790s, which was rebuilt in 1820. The chapel was rebuilt again in 1873 and is now North Leigh Methodist Church. Windmill Gospel HallWindmill Gospel Hall is a small independent church in Common Road that was built in the 20th century. Its current building is the second on the site. Social and economic history By AD 1005 there was an east-west road through Bladon, Long Hanborough and North Leigh parish that was the main link between Witney and Oxford. Over the centuries its course changed and it was straightened, and in 1751 it was made into a turnpike. It ceased to be a turnpike in 1869, and the modern course of the road is now classified the A4095. The Masons Arms (right) and Windmill Cottage (left) in Park Road North Leigh's first record of a public house is from 1587, when Richard Breakspear was licensed as an ale-house keeper. In 1774 North Leigh three ale-houses: the Chequers, the Dun Cow and the King's Arms, but the Chequers and the Kings Arms had ceased trading by 1795. The Dun Cow was on the main road opposite the north gate of Eynsham Park. It too had ceased trading by the 1820s. By 1847 there were two new pubs: the Harcourt Arms and the Parker Arms. The Parker Arms ceased trading about 1870. The Harcourt Arms used a house dating from 1783, and was turned back into a private house in 1984. North Leigh's next recorded pub was the Masons Arms, which had opened by 1871 and remains open today. In 1642 Royalist troops were billeted in the village after the English Civil War Battle of Edgehill and \\"plundered and pillaged\\" the neighbourhood. On 4 June 1644 Charles I, while retreating from Oxford, spent the night at Perrotts Hill Farm before continuing westwards to Burford. Tower windmill at North Leigh, built 1833, neglected and semi-derelict May 2019 =Windmill= In the centre of the village is North Leigh windmill. It is a tower mill built in 1833 by Joseph Shepherd, who was a baker as well as a miller. It had four common sails and a conical cap. The mill was restored in 1881 and 1933, but during the Second World War the cap was removed in 1940 to make an observation post. This led the interior of the building to fall into decay, and in the 1980s West Oxfordshire District Council tried to compel the owner to repair it. The mill still lacks sails, but it now has a new cap to make it weatherproof. School In 1721 Anne Perrott, wife of the Lord of the Manor, gave money to pay for a teacher and books for children in the village. By the 1830s the village had two schools, and in 1838 George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough gave a site for a new school building into which to merge them. The school was built with a Parliamentary grant and organised as a National School. The school often had more pupils than it was built for, and was enlarged in 1854, 1871 and 1885. It was reorganised as a junior school in 1928 and became a Church of England schoolNorth Leigh C of E Primary School in 1959. The school moved to a new building on a different site in 1967, and the old school building and teacher's house were sold as private housing in 1974.

Perea, \\"The treasure of Guarrazar : Tracing the gold supplies in the Visigothic Iberian peninsula\\", Archeometry 49.1 (2007) pp. 53-74. was dug between 1858 and 1861 in an orchard called Guarrazar, in Guadamur, very close to Toledo, Spain. The treasure was divided, with some objects going to the Musée de Cluny in Paris and the rest to the armouries of the Palacio Real in Madrid (today in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain). In 1921 and 1936, some items of the Treasure of Guarrazar were stolen and have disappeared. Some comparable Visigothic filigree gold was found in 1926 at Torredonjimeno in the province of Jaén, consisting of fragments of votive crowns and crosses.Described and compared in Alicia Perea, \\"Visigothic filigree in the Guarrazar (Toledo) and Torredonjimeno (Jaén) treasures,\\" Historic Metallurgy 40.1 (2006).  Description  The jewellery found at Guarrazar is part of a continuous tradition of Iberian metalworking that goes back to prehistoric times. These Visigothic works were influenced by the Byzantines, but the techniques of gem encrustation found at Guarrazar were practised throughout the Germanic world and the style of the lettering was Germanic too. The crowns were never meant to be worn by the kings. They were gifts to the church, to be hung above the altar. The most valuable remaining pieces of the find are the two royal votive crowns: one of King Recceswinth and one of King Suinthila. Both are made of gold, encrusted with sapphires, pearls, and other precious stones. Suinthila's crown was stolen in 1921 and never recovered. There are several other small crowns and many votive crosses. There were belts in the original find as well, but these have since vanished. These findings, together with other of some neighbors and with the archaeological excavation of the Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Academy of History (April 1859), formed a group consisting of: * National Archaeological Museum of Spain: six crowns, five crosses, a pendant and remnants of foil and channels (almost all of gold). * Royal Palace of Madrid: a crown and a gold cross and a stone engraved with the Annunciation. A crown, and other fragments of a tiller with a crystal ball were stolen from the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1921 and its whereabouts are still unknown. * National Museum of the Middle Ages, Paris: three crowns, two crosses, links and gold pendants. There were also many fragments of sculptures and the remains of a building, perhaps a Roman sanctuary or place of purification. After its dedication to Christian worship as a church or oratory, it housed a number of graves. A skeleton lying on a bed of lime and sand was found in the best preserved grave. Its well-preserved stone slate has a Latin inscription that mentions a priest named Crispín, dating from 693 (year of the Sixteenth Council of Toledo). This slate is now in the National Archeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. The inscription on the Sónnica cross, a piece preserved in Paris, gives an indication about the name of this church. According to some hypothesis, the monastery of Santa Maria de Sorbaces of Guarrazar served as a hideout for the real treasure of the court, Toledo churches and monasteries to prevent their capture by the Islamic conquest of Iberia.

The provinces identified with the Global South represent most of the Southern Hemisphere and Third World provinces within the Communion, including all those from Africa, the largest from South America, most from Asia and two Oceania provinces. Global South provinces are characterized by their theological conservatism on matters of sexual ethics and life issues, and by their Evangelicalism in churchmanship. The grouping excludes the Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil, the Anglican Church of Australia and the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, despite the fact that some Australian and New Zealand dioceses were already represented in their meetings, and the Asian provinces of Japan and Korea. The Anglican Church of Southern Africa is officially associated to the Global South and was already represented in several meetings, despite being more liberal than their African counterparts. The Anglican Diocese of South Carolina, which left the Episcopal Church in October 2012, was accepted into Global South in August 2014 with the Global South temporarily caring for the Diocese until a formal decision is made, with plans announced in 2016 to join the Anglican Church in North America formally requiring two formal votes at future Diocese annual conventions (2017 and 2018).Announcement regarding the Diocese of South Carolina, 22 August 2014. The Global South encounters started in 1994. The Global South standing gained impetus concerning the controversies over the acceptance of non-celibate homosexuality, as the blessing of same-sex unions and the allowing of non- celibate homosexual clergy was being promoted by the Episcopal Church of the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada. The apex of the controversy took place with the consecration of Gene Robinson, a partnered homosexual, as bishop of the Episcopal Church in 2003. The Global South churches have since then vigorously opposed the legitimacy of any acceptance of same-sex relationships within the Anglican Communion. Several of the Global South Primates attended the GAFCON (Global Anglican Future Conference) that took place in Jerusalem in 2008, as an alternative to the Lambeth Conference. They also supported the creation of the Anglican Church in North America, in 2009, as a province in formation of the Anglican Communion and a theologically conservative alternative in the United States and Canada in opposition to what were viewed as revisionist departures that had taken place in these provinces concerning specifically human sexuality and the interpretation of the Bible. Archbishop Robert Duncan of the Anglican Church in North America was present at the Global South Primates Encounter that took place in Singapore, on 19–23 April 2010. The final statement declared: \\"We are grateful that the recently formed Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) is a faithful expression of Anglicanism.

He was born December 19, 1865 in Freeborn, Minnesota in the United States in a Seventh-day Baptist home. Spicer worked for the church in the United States, England and India, where Spicer College is named after him. He served as Secretary of the General Conference during the presidency of A. G. Daniells and Daniells served as the Secretary during Spicer's years as president. The two men led the Adventist Church for the first 30 years of the 20th century. 1887–1903 Spicer's responsibilities with the church during this time included assisting Stephen Haskell as his secretary. This led 22-year-old Spicer to England. There he gained experience as an editor of The Present Truth and in assisting with evangelistic campaigns. In 1892, he returned to the United States and served as Secretary of the recently established (1889) Foreign Missions Board. This began decades of Spicer's leadership in the SDA Church's mission development. W. A. Spicer: 1898 in India. (Second from the right in back row.) In 1898, Spicer worked in India as editor of the Oriental Watchman. Secretary of the General Conference, 1903–1922 As Secretary to the General Conference, Spicer assisted President Daniells in shaping the church's response to issues. Daniell's crises were met often in collaboration with Spicer: the reorganization of the church accomplished at the 1901 and 1903 General Conference sessions; the denominational dispute between Daniells and Kellogg; racial issues arising; etc. Spicer and Daniells led the church in a strong mission emphasis. New opportunities brought about the reorganization of existing institutions and the creation of new ones. Spicer viewed these opportunities to spread the Adventist \\"message\\" as a sign of fulfilled prophecy. In 1914, he reported to the SDA world church, \\"... And the same living God who launched the definite advent movement on its way at the exact time of the prophecy (1844), began at the same time in a special way to open the doors of access to 'every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.' We have seen the way open again and again immediately before our own feet as the heralds of the third angel's message have entered the various lands.\\" Spicer reported on the conflict between Kellogg and the General Conference leadership. He met with Kellogg to discuss what was considered pantheistic ideas.How the Spirit of Prophecy Met a Crisis: Memories and Notes of the \\"Living Temple\\" Controversy by W. A. Spicer The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement had come about as a result of the actions of L. R. Conradi and certain European church leaders during the war, who decided that it was acceptable for Adventists to take part in war, which was in clear opposition to the historical position of the church that had always upheld the non-combative position. Since the American Civil War, Adventists were known as non-combatants, and had done work in hospitals or given medical care rather than taken combat roles.http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists sent Spicer to investigate the changes. He was unable to resolve the schism.http://www.imssdarm- bg.org/content/view/185/66/ President of the General Conference, 1922–1930 With the experience acquired as General Conference Secretary, Spicer was elected as president of the General Conference during the 1922 General Conference session. He continued with the church's mission commitment which led to a further expansion of the Adventist message throughout the world. He was known in the church as an enthusiastic editor and successful author an influential preacher, proficient organizer and a passionate missionary.

The school serves students in grades 9-12 and is part of the Shelby City School District. A long time member of the Northern Ohio League (1944-2017), Shelby joined the Sandusky Bay Conference in 2017. Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships * Boys Track and Field – 2003, 2004, 2019 * Boys Cross Country – 1979 * Boys Golf – 1980 * Girls Basketball – 1983 * Girls Track and Field – 2003 History The original Central School was dedicated in 1875 in downtown Shelby in the Central Park area. Later Shelby Central High School was built as an addition to Central School in 1901 which faced East Main on the corner of Main and High School Avenue. That building was later replaced by the new Shelby High School built in the years 1924-1925 which was behind Central High School at the end of Park Avenue along the three-way intersection of Park Ave, Mack Ave, and High School Ave. That building was added onto in 1938, 1951, and 1969. This building has since been demolished in September/October 2013 and the land will serve as a parking lot after the land has been cleared. Demolition began with the 1951 music/shop wing progressed to the 1969/1938 additions and was completed by razing the original 1924 building. The old Central High School was later demolished in 1950 and replaced by the current Central Elementary School built in the same year. In 1965 Shelby Senior High School was built on W. Smiley Ave. located next to Sunset Dr. and the land that would become the Shelby YMCA. When the present school was built the old school bell from the 1875 Central High was installed near the front entrance to the senior high. At that time the 1924 Shelby High School was turned into a junior high school housing grades 7-9 from 1965-1970 and grades 7-8 from 1970-2013. At the beginning of the 1995-1996 school year, the building became Shelby Middle School. In 2010, a 24 million dollar bond to build a new high school passed. Construction of the new Shelby High School was completed 2 days before the 2013-2014 school year began. The Shelby Middle School moved into the 1965 school, housing grades six through eight. The new school is equipped with various new technologies that the previous building was incapable of housing. The new building also has a separate auxiliary gym housed behind the main gym in a separate building. With the loss of the 1924 structure and theater, a new 764-seat theater was built in the new school to replace it. Yearbook The Shelby High School Yearbook began in 1913 under the leadership of noted author, Dawn Powell. A literary pamphlet called The Tatler was produced in 1913. In 1914 a full size yearbook by the same name was published with Dawn Powell serving as Editor in Chief. No yearbook was published from 1915-1926. In 1927 the Scarlet S began publication which ran through 1930. From 1931-1945 smaller \\"Memory Books\\" were produced containing only senior pictures and a few group pictures. These were vellum covered booklets and are hard to find today. The Scarlet S was revived in 1946 and has since been published annually. For over 20 years, it has been the tradition of the yearbook staff to produce a \\"Red and Gray\\" book at least once every four years so that every student has at least one book in the school colors over their four years at Shelby High School. Since 1980, each book has had a theme, around which the color scheme, layout and design, and content are focused. Themes: 2013 - Leaving Our Mark 2012 - It's What We Are 2011 - Elements 2010 - My Time 2009 - Seen, Heard, Noted, Quoted 2008 - Coloring Outside the Lines 2007 - Anatomy of a Whippet 2006 - Coming into Focus 2005 - Fragments Captured As One 2004 - Conquer the Fire 2003 - What About Us 2002 - Now It's Our Turn 2001 - Looking Forward 2 Looking Back 2000 - Stepping into the Millennium 1999 - Going Out With A Bang 1998 - Capturing The Moment 1992 - Going Against the Grain 1991 - Outta Control 1990 - In With The New 1989 - Out with the Old 1985 - Let the Good Times Roll 1983 - Whip It Into Action 1982 - These Are the Best of Times 1981 - Is That All There Is... 1980 - Crusin' 80 A former tradition was to dedicate the book to a notable faculty member. Dedications: 1963 - Mr. Emile John, Mathematics teacher 1960 - Miss Harryet Snyder, Biology teacher 1958 - Mr. Dwight Sommerville, Band teacher 1957 - Mr. Robert Lafferty, Superintendent; In memory of Miss Leah Summer 1952 - J.E.

Whippet Theater hosts a winter and spring show held in the new Shelby High School Performing Arts Center. In previous years it was tradition to hold a fall performance in the 1925 Shelby High School (Shelby Middle School) Auditorium with a performance in the spring held at the 1965 Shelby Senior High School's (current Shelby Middle School) David A. Jones Little Theater. Shelby Whippet Band The Shelby Whippet Band has been around since 1927 by Maurice Davis (Director 1927-1938). Russell Kroger took over in 1939 and was followed by Jack Luth in 1941. The modern era Shelby Whippet Band was formed in 1945 by Dwight Sommerville (Director 1945-1983). The band incorporated many synonymous elements during the 1950s such as \\"The Trot\\" and \\"The Shelby Line\\". These two elements are probably what most people will say they remember about the band. The Shelby Flag Corps were added in the 1970s under the direction of Lynn Love who continued to be the flag advisor until 2013. The Shelby Flag Corps was abolished in 2013 due to low participation. After the retirement of Dwight Sommerville in 1983, Jack Gray became the director and served until 2000. Jack Gray was followed by Lisa Baker, with associate/head marching director Bryan Day and Tim Mayer. The band continues the many great traditions of the past while moving ahead into the future.

At that time a number of dhobis led by a dhobi named Sita lived on the bank of a pond (today known as Sita Dighi) that was part of Sen's agricultural land. One day, Sita went missing and could not be found. Her body was found a few days later, floating in the pond. Thinking it was a ghostly incident, Sita's dhobis left the bank and migrated to an unknown place without informing anyone. The village then came to be known as Dhobaura, meaning floating dhoba in the Bengali language. A mouza centred in Dhobaura was later established and not long after it became a union parishad.

(flyleaf). Amans was born in Maastricht, a French city at the time. His father, Paul Serge Amans, was born in Narbonne (F) in 1765, was a French officer (Capitaine-Adjudant de place de 1ère classe à Maastricht) of Napoléon. Jacques Guillaume Lucien Amans was trained in the French neoclassical tradition of portraiture. He exhibited at the Paris Salon from 1831 to 1837. News of fellow-artist Jean Joseph Vaudechamp’s good fortune in finding patrons probably led Amans to visit Louisiana since the two artists traveled on the same ship from France to New Orleans in about 1837. Following Vaudechamp’s departure from Louisiana in 1839, Amans assumed the role as the most celebrated portraitist in Louisiana. In the mid-1840s he married Azoline Landreaux, the daughter of a St. Charles Parish sugar planter Pierre Honoré Landreaux and Joséphine Armant, and purchased Trinity Plantation on Bayou Lafourche. Amans and Azoline moved back to France in 1856 where he died in 1888, château de Lévis Saint Nom (78), never having returned to Louisiana. Work Clara Mazureau, whose portrait Amans painted when she was a young girl, was the daughter of Aimée Grima and Étienne Mazureau, Attorney General of Louisiana. Amans completed the portraits of several members of the Grima and Mazureau families in the 1840s. As in the Clara Mazureau portrait, Amans- favored the three quarter length pose.Lombardi, Tara, The Great Advocate: Étienne Mazureau, accomplished attorney & statesman (1777-1849), De Novo, Vol. 7(2), Fall 2009, pp. 6-7. The article author suggests the painting of Étienne Mazureau could be Amans' or Vaudechamp's work, however, it has been noted the technical details of the painting are truer to Amans' style than Vaudechamp's. Influenced by the French neoclassical artists Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and Jacques-Louis David, Amans emphasized meticulous draftsmanship and realism with particular attention to the sitter’s face and hands. Famous subjects Among Amans' most famous subjects was President Andrew Jackson, who sat for his portrait in 1840 (the 25th Anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans). The painting is rich in details of both physiognomy and surroundings, and shows an elderly, though not frail, former president.

CHRIS R. de FREITAS Obituary was a New Zealand climate scientist. He was an associate professor in the School of Environment at the University of Auckland. Education and professional career De Freitas, born in Trinidad, received both his Bachelor's and his Master's at the University of Toronto, Canada, after which he earned his PhD as a Commonwealth Scholar from the University of Queensland, Australia. During his time at the University of Auckland, he served as deputy dean of science, head of science and technology, and for four years as pro vice-chancellor. He also served as vice-president of the Meteorological Society of New Zealand and was a founding member of the Australia–New Zealand Climate Forum as well as serving on the executive board of the International Society of Biometeorology from 1999 to 2001. He wrote extensively in popular media on an array of environmental and climate-related issues. He won the New Zealand Association of Scientists' science communicator award. Global warming and scepticism about anthropogenic causes De Freitas has questioned anthropogenic global warming, and the way information is received and interpreted. He has written that carbon dioxide emissions themselves may not necessarily be the source of recent increases in global temperature. In the New Zealand Herald (9 May 2006), he wrote: : \\"There is evidence of global warming. The climate has warmed about 0.6 °C in the past 100 years, but most of that warming occurred prior to 1940, before the post World War II industrialisation that led to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. But warming does not confirm that carbon dioxide is causing it. Climate is always warming or cooling. There are natural variability theories of warming.\\" As an editor for the journal Climate Research he had responsibility for sending papers out for review. In four instances, questions were raised about the review process of papers he had handled. The last of these led to the Soon and Baliunas controversy, in which a flawed paper was published under his editorial responsibility. The publisher, Otto Kinne, subsequently conceded that the conclusions of the paper were not supported by the evidence, and appropriate revisions of the manuscript should have been requested prior to publication.

The first magazine was The Electrical Experimenter (1913–1931) and the most notable magazines were Radio News (1919–1985) and Amazing Stories (1926–2005). Their radio station, WRNY, began broadcasting experimental television in 1928. In early 1929 the company was forced into bankruptcy and the Gernsback brothers lost control of Experimenter Publishing. The magazines did not miss an issue and were quickly sold to another publisher. The Gernsbacks promptly started new magazines to compete with their former ones. Radio News became Popular Electronics and the January 1975 issue featured the Altair 8800 computer on the cover; this launched the personal computer revolution. Hugo Gernsback's Amazing Stories is regarded as the first dedicated science fiction magazine and every year World Science Fiction Society gives the Hugo Awards for the best science fiction and fantasy works.  Origins  Electro Importing Catalog Hugo Gernsback was born in Luxembourg in 1884 and he became fascinated with electricity as a boy. While studying electrical engineering at a Technikum University in Bingen, Germany; he built a simple radio transmitter and receiver. Gernsback also developed a powerful dry-cell battery but was unable to patent it in Europe. In February 1904 Gernsback emigrated to America hoping to sell his battery design to automobile companies and had modest success with this. Gernsback lived in a New York City boarding house where he met Lewis Coggeshall, a railroad telegraph operator. They found it difficult to purchase radio parts in New York City so in 1905 they decided to start the Electro Importing Company to sell European-imported radio components and electrical components by mail-order.Hugo Gernsback and radio intersection in broadcast history magazines: An influential intersection in broadcast history An early product was a spark-gap telegraph transmitter with a one-mile range that was first advertised in the November 25, 1905, issue of Scientific American and sold for $8.50. Another product featured in The Electro Importing Company was Gernsback's own Telimco Wireless Telegraph, the name of which comes from the letters in the catalog's name. The set was sold starting in 1905, with the lowest-priced option starting at $6.00 The low price caused trouble, however, as Gernsback received accusations of fraud from people who believed the Telimco was too cheap to be a product of actual quality. Upon investigation, Gernsback and Coggeshall were able to prove to a police officer who had come to the Electro Importing Company's office that the Telimco did work as advertised. The Electro Importing Company catalogs soon had 64 pages of products and detailed technical articles on how to use the components offered for sale. The catalog used the title Modern Electrics in 1908 before the magazine was launched. The catalog continued to grow and used various titles. The catalog reached several prominent radio entrepreneurs, including Lee De Forest, who read the catalog while developing his Audion tube, Edgar Felix, who purchased headphones from the store on Fulton Street, and Stanley Manning, a Detroit Broadcaster who traveled to New York to see Gernsback's store. Gernsback bought Coggeshall's share of the company in 1907. To expand Electro Importing, Gernsback ran a classified ad in the January 27, 1908 New York Times looking for a new investor. > Partner wanted in well-established electrical manufacturing business; good > chance for right party; have more orders than can fill; only parties with > sufficient capital need apply. H. Gernsback, 108 Duane St. Milton Hymes answered and with the new capital, Electro Importing moved to a larger building on Fulton Street and later opened two retail stores. Modern Electrics was launched as a magazine in April 1908. The Electro Importing Catalogs continued independently. This is the magazine where Gernsback wrote his first science fiction story \\"Ralph 124C 41+\\" in April 1911. Gernsback wanted to start a second magazine, \\"Electrical Experimenter\\", so he sold Modern Electrics and the Modern Publishing Company to a business partner, Orland Ridenour. The last issue with Hugo Gernsback as editor was March 1913. The first issue of \\"Electrical Experimenter\\" was May 1913. Modern Publishing acquired Electrician and Mechanic and merged it with Modern Electrics in January 1914 to become Modern Electrics and Mechanics. After a series of mergers and title changes the magazine became Popular Science Monthly in October 1915 and is still published today. Hugo Gernsback frequently formed new partnerships with investors for a new magazine or other opportunity (such as a radio station). The Experimenter Publishing Company was incorporated in March 1915. The corporate officers were Hugo Gernsback, his brother Sidney Gernsback and Milton Hymes. Hymes had worked with Gernsback since 1908 and was an officer in both the Electro Importing Company and the Experimenter Publishing Company. Hymes died in a railroad accident in 1917. Robert W. De Mott replaced Hymes as advertising manager and corporate Secretary.  Magazines  Staccatone music synthesizer Electrical Experimenter, introduced in May 1913, was initially published by the Electro Importing Company. \\"Electrical Experimenter. © Electro Importing Co. New York. … V.2 No.12, Apr. 1915 © Mar. 25, 1915\\" The new Experimenter Publishing Company became the publisher with the May 1915 issue. \\"Electrical Experimenter. © Experimenter Publishing Co. New York. V.3 No.1, May 1915 © Apr. 21, 1915\\" The June 1918 cover had a sub-title of \\"Science and Invention\\", and the contents expanded to include general science, chemistry and mechanics. It continued to publish fiction stories. Science and Invention became the primary title in August 1920 and the last issue was in August 1931. Experimenter Publishing created a magazine devoted to radio in July 1919, Radio Amateur News. The title was shortened to Radio News in June 1920. The magazine was very successful. It appealed to amateur radio operators and to hobbyists wanting to listen to the new commercial radio stations. Radio News, under various titles, was published until 1985. The articles in Radio News were technically sophisticated so a new magazine, Practical Electrics, was created to appeal to a wider audience. This was initially published by Practical Electrics Company, a subsidiary of Experimenter Publishing. The first issue was November 1921. The magazine never printed more than 60,000 copies; the old Electrical Experimenter had 100,000 readers and Radio News now had 400,000. In the November 1924 issue Hugo Gernsback wrote \\"We therefore decided last month to bring back the old Electrical Experimenter once and for all.\\"; the title became The Experimenter The magazine was merged into Science and Invention in February 1926. = Other publications = The Consolidated Radio Call Book Company published blueprints and instructions for building radio equipment. These were sold to amateur radio operators and hobbyist by radio parts stores across the United States. Hugo Gernsback was President and R. W. DeMott was Secretary of this publicly traded company. The name was changed to the Consrad Company in June 1923. The Electro Importing Company was selling more books and fewer radio parts and transitioned into a publishing company. Consrad began distributing the E. I. Co. books to radio dealers. ) The Radio Specialty Company, \\"RASCO\\", took over the parts business. In 1926 the Consrad started the Radio Listeners' Guide and Call Book, a quarterly magazine. Sidney Gernsback was the editor and his name appeared on the cover. A typical issue had 50 pages of radio station listing and 100 pages of detailed radio construction plans. Your Body Advertisement Sidney Gernsback published a hard bound \\"Radio Encyclopedia\\" for that was independent of Experimenter Publishing or the Consrad Company. It claimed to cover every phase of radio with \\"over 1930 separate definitions, 549 illustrations, a complete cross index, and many other special features.\\" The Encyclopedia was not part of the bankruptcy. Hugo Gernsback also published magazines that appealed to a general audience. Motor Camper & Tourist was a travel guide for those that toured the United States by automobile. The July 1924 issue started a series about driving and camping across the country from New York City to San Francisco. Motor Camper & Tourist magazines. Another was Your Body, a guide to the operation and mechanics of the human body. An advertisement for the magazine claimed that \\"each issue is practically an endless source of information on sex, prevention and care of diseases, the senses and the normal functions of nature as related to our bodies.\\" Time Magazine reviewed the first issue with an article titled \\"Unsexing Sex\\". Gernsback promoted it as a magazine for the whole family but Time felt the target audience was \\"radio bugs\\" (a 1920s term for geeks). Hugo Gernsback had always published fiction stories in his magazines. He wanted stories that promoted imaginative uses of science and technology. This \\"scientific fiction\\" needed to be somewhat plausible. The August 1923 Science and Invention had an astronaut in a space suit on the cover and the issue was devoted to scientific fiction. Gernsback began developing a scientific fiction magazine and Amazing Stories was launched with the April 1926 issue. By 1928, Experimenter Publishing and Consrad were publishing a wide selection of books. In addition the radio titles, there were general interest books like Houdini's Spirit Exposes, Beauty Secrets, and Popular Tricks. These were prominently advertised in their magazines.  WRNY  Ad promoting magazines and radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh was the first commercial radio station in the United States, having made their first broadcast in November 1920. By 1925 there were over 500 broadcast stations in the United States. KDKA was operated by Westinghouse Electric to help sell radio receivers. In addition to radio equipment manufacturers, many publishers were starting stations. Experimenter Publishing applied for and was granted a radio station license to transmit at 1160 kilocycles (kHz) with the call sign WRNY. (Over the next three years they would use 800 kHz, 1070 kHz, 970 kHz, 920 kHz and finally 1010 kHz.) The state of the art studio was in a room on the 18th floor of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City and the 500 watt transmitter located on the hotel roof. The first broadcast was on June 12, 1925 and was reported in the New York Times. The opening speaker was former Senator Chauncey Depew followed by the \\"father of radio\\", Lee De Forest. This was followed by live musical entertainment. The Times noted Hugo Gernsback's Staccatone signal generator that was used before the station signed on and signing the end of programs. The Staccatone was a primitive music synthesizer described in the March 1924 Practical Electrics magazine. Experimenter Publishing used the radio station and the magazines to promote each other. The station call letters, WRNY, appeared on each magazine cover. By 1927 there were over fifty radio stations and 1.5 million radio sets in the New York metropolitan area. There were so many stations it was common for stations to share the same frequency at different times during the day. The Radio Act of 1912 did not mention broadcasting and it was not clear who controlled radio stations, the states or the federal government. Early radio receivers were not very selective and there were frequent disputes over interference between stations with adjacent frequencies. In November 1926, WRNY (800 kHz) moved its transmitter from the Roosevelt Hotel to Coytesville, New Jersey (directly across the river from Manhattan). Radio station WHN (830 kHz) claimed this blocked their signal and alleged WRNY was a \\"pirate\\" broadcaster. In 1927 the Federal Radio Commission was established with the authority to regulate broadcast stations. Home-made television in Science and Invention (November 1928) Hugo Gernsback first wrote about television in the December 1909 issue of Modern Electrics and had reported on the technical advances in his magazines. By 1925 mechanical scanning television systems were becoming available with resolutions of up to 60 scan lines. These mechanical systems were simple enough that a hobbyist could construct a television receiver. Vladimir K. Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth were developing electronic scanning systems that were the precursors of modern television. These would not be available for another decade. In April 1928, Pilot Electric Manufacturing and WRNY announced that television broadcast would begin that fall. Pilot would provide the transmitting equipment. Pilot also sold the receivers but Experimenter Publishing magazines provided complete plans that allowed readers to build their own television. The system used by WRNY had 48 scan lines with 7.5 frames per second. The image was about 1.5 inches square. This low resolution picture (without sound) could be transmitted in the 5 kHz audio bandwidth of an AM radio station. (The NTSC 525 line standard definition television signal is allotted a 6 MHz bandwidth.) The first test broadcast was on August 12, 1928. Others had been transmitting television before this but WRNY was the first to have a regular scheduled program.The broadcast has been postponed until Friday (August 17). Hugo Gernsback estimated that there were around 2000 television receivers in the New York area.  Bankruptcy  = Background = By 1927 the expenses exceeded the income of the Experimenter Publishing Company. The radio station had a stream of advertising revenue but there was the new transmitter facility in New Jersey plus the investment in television equipment. WRNY was losing around $50,000 a year by 1927. Hugo Gernsback received a salary of $50,000 per year; his brother Sidney received $39,000. As a comparison, the Governor of New York State earned $25,000 a year. In February 1927 the Experimenter Publishing Company leased the entire sixteenth floor of 230 Fifth Avenue to be used as executive offices. In an effort to boost the circulation, Hugo Gernsback announce in the April 1927 Radio News that the radio project blue prints that had been selling for one or two dollars were now free. The largest expenses for a magazine publisher are paper and printing. The publisher has to print enough copies to supply every outlet. At the end of the month the distributor would return the unsold copies to the publisher for a credit. Experimenter Publishing had 4 or 5 monthly magazines so this was a considerable expense. By 1928 the creditors had installed resident accountants at Experimenter Publishing to review the expenditures. = Proceedings = The largest creditors were the paper supplier, Bulkley Dunton Co. ($154,406), Art Color Printing Co. of Dunellen, N.J. ($152,908) and Edward Langer Printing Co., ($14,614). \\"Experimenter Publishing Co., Inc., 230 Fifth Avenue. - Liabilities approximately $500,000, assets not stated. Principal creditors listed are Art Color Printing Co., Dunellen, N.J., $152,908; Bulkley Dunton Co., $154,406; Walter Braunstein, $10,258; Edward Langer Printing Co., Hollis L.I., $14,614; S. Gernsback, $8, 450; Spencer Wynne Paper Products, Newburgh, N.Y., $9,249; Sieldinger Press, $8,719; Service Photo Co., $6,227.\\" On February 20, 1929 an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Experimenter Publishing Company on behalf of Daniel A. Walters ($2,030), Marie E. Bachmann ($2,094) and Robert Halper ($2,095). The fact that minor creditors forced the bankruptcy has nourished various conspiracy theories over the years. The total liabilities were estimated at $600,000 and assets at $182,000. Federal Judge Mack appointed the Irving Trust Company as the receiver. Hugo Gernsback spoke to the press afterward and said: \\"Plans are being formulated to reorganize and continue publication as heretofore. I am authorized to say this by the receiver.\\" The April 1929 issues of Radio News (on the newsstand March 10), Amazing Stores and Science and Invention were the last to feature Hugo Gernsback as editor. The Irving Trust appointed publisher Bergan A. MacKinnon as circulation manager and Arthur Lynch as managing editor. The WRNY stayed on the air and the magazines did not miss an issue. The bankruptcy proceedings were enthusiastically covered in the news and gossip columns of the New York City press. The creditors of Experimenter Publishing and the Consrad Company reviewed bids at a March 28 hearing before the bankruptcy referee. Two publishers, B. A. MacKinnon and Macfadden Publications, entered similar bids that would almost pay the creditors in full. After these two complete bids were read, Chester Cuthell then offered $60,000 for the radio stations. The MacKinnon offer was revised to allow the separate sale of the stations, Macfadden wanted to keep the stations. Motion Picture Publications offered $50,000 cash for Amazing Stories. Fawcett Publishing offered $30,000 cash for Science and Invention. The Robert McBride Company offered $300,000 for Science and Invention and Amazing Stories. The hearing was adjourned for a week to allow the creditor's committee to evaluate the bids. At the April 3 hearing, Mr. MacKinnon agreed to pay $200,000 now and $300,000 more in September. Mr. Cuthell acting for the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company would pay the other $100,000 for the radio stations. After administration expenses, the creditors were paid 95 cents on the dollar. The attorneys handling receivership said this was the first time they had seen a forced sale pay off the creditors in full. The Irving Trust Company's decision to keep the magazines and stations running avoided an early sale at a sacrifice price. The first bid for complete company was $100,000. The first offer for the radio stations was only $7,500. Here is a New York Times account of the final bidding. > The final bidding for the radio stations was spirited. Carl W. Kirchway, > acting for The New York Evening Journal, bid $90,000 and then raised the bid > to $100,000. Mr. Kirchway asked for and obtained a recess to enable him to > reach William R. Hearst in California. It was reported that Mr. Hearst could > not be reached and Mr. Kirchway decided that he was not authorized to exceed > Mr. Cuthell's bid. Hotel filler ads Hugo and Sidney Gernsback were questioned at an April 19 hearing about the operation of the Experimenter Publishing and the Consrad Company. They were questioned by attorneys for the Irving Trust Company and B. A. MacKinnon \\"to discover any assets which may have been concealed or diverted.\\" Attorneys for Mr. MacKinnon, questioned the method of the bankrupt companies in allowing hotels space for advertising in the magazines published by the Gernsbacks for trade bills (vouchers) instead of cash. The Gernsbacks explained that the space assigned to the hotels was unsold at the press date and the ads were \\"fillers.\\" The trade bills were given to wholesalers, advertisers and others with whom they did business. Hugo Gernsback was also asked about letters soliciting subscribers for his new company, Gernsback Publications, Inc. and if the subscription lists of the bankrupt firm had been used. \\"Mr. Gernsback emphatically denied that such lists had been used.\\" \\"Mr. Gernsback said after the hearing that his new magazines would be Radio Craft, Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories and that the first issues would be out in June.\\" The Experimenter Publishing bankruptcy made it to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1933. The state of New York missed the deadline for filing claims but still wanted the back taxes the Experimenter Publishing owed. The court ruled that the Constitution gave control of bankruptcy to the federal government and the states would have to follow the rules and procedures like any other creditor.  After the bankruptcy  = Gernsback Publications = Gernsback was quickly able to raise capital for a new publishing company. The June issue of Science Wonder Stories was on the newsstand on May 3, 1929. This was one of two magazines Gernsback created to compete with Amazing Stories; his Air Wonder Stories appeared six weeks later. They were merged into Wonder Stories after a year. The July issues of Radio Craft appeared on the newsstand on June 5, 1929, three months after Gernsback lost Radio News. There was a new Everyday Science and Mechanics to compete with Science and Invention. Hugo Gernsback often published articles about the history of his magazines, but the bankruptcy was always ignored. The April 1958 Radio-Electronics (formerly Radio Craft) has a 16-page story on Gernsback's 50 year publishing history. Here is the complete description of the bankruptcy: \\"In the spring of 1929, Radio News, Science and Invention, Amazing Stories and associated magazines were sold to other interest. Radio News of April, 1929, was the last Gernsback issue.\\" The eve of the Great Depression was not an ideal time to start new magazines but Gernsback persevered. Radio Craft and successor titles were in print until January 2003. Gernsback decided to focus on radio magazines and added Short Wave Craft in June 1930 and Television News in 1931. Wonder Stories was sold to Thrilling Publications in 1936 and it was in print until 1955. Science and Mechanics was sold to Virgil Angerman in 1937 and it was in print until the 1970s (as late as May 1974). = Experimenter Publications = B. A. MacKinnon immediately renamed the company to Experimenter Publications and then to Radio-Science Publications in November 1930. MacKinnon's plan was to pay off the debt of acquiring the magazine with the revenue from the magazines. The Depression drove many advertisers out of business and made magazines a luxury for many readers. Radio-Science Publications ceased operations with the August 1931 issues. Bernarr Macfadden's newly formed Teck Publishing Corporation took over with the September 1931 issue. \\"Teck Publishing Corp. J Schultz. 522 5th Av. $10,000\\" Joseph Schultz was the attorney for Macfadden Publications, Inc. Radio News and Amazing Stories were continued but Science and Invention was sold and absorbed into Popular Mechanics magazine.\\"Science and Invention, a magazine long and favorably known, has been merged with Popular Mechanics.\\" Radio News and Amazing Stories were in poor financial health when Ziff-Davis acquired them in January 1938. They were listed as publisher in the March issues but the April issues were the first produced under their control. Radio News was published by Ziff-Davis under several titles until 1985. They published Amazing Stories until 1965 when it was sold to Ultimate Publishing. = WRNY = Immediately after the bankruptcy auction, the Aviation Radio Station, Inc. was formed to take over the WRNY radio stations. C. M. Keys, president of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, provided the financial backing for the new company. Chester Cuthell, the attorney who was at the auction, was the president and Walter Lemmon was the general manager. The goal of the station was to promote aviation. The Federal Radio Commission had to approve station license transfer and any changes to the station. Mr. Cuthell asked the commission for more frequencies as he said that he and his partners had up to $2,000,000 dollars to spend on the stations. The commission approved the license transfers and improvements to the existing stations. In August 1929 Aviation Radio moved the studios from the Roosevelt Hotel to 27 West Fifty-Seventh Street. They also installed a new 1000 watt transmitter with automatic frequency control and new speech amplifiers at their plant in Coytesville NJ. These upgrades improved the range and sound quality of their broadcast. The short wave station, 2XLA, increased is power to 15,000 watts.The radio stations format was changed; the Jazz music was prohibited and replaced with presentations devoted to aviation and aviators. On a show about women aviators, Amelia Earhart recounted her recent transcontinental flight. The station gave hourly weather reports of aviators. After 1928 WRNY was at 1010 kilocycles (kHz) and shared the frequency with 3 other stations. This is a typical broadcast schedule: WRNY started at 10:00 AM, WHN followed at 1:30 PM, WPAP followed at 7:00 PM, and finally WRNY closed out the broadcast day from 9:30 PM to midnight. WQAO, own by the Calvary Baptist Church, broadcast three programs on Sunday and one on Wednesday. The owner of WHN, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, bought the other stations in 1933 and WHN used 1010 kHz full-time starting in January 1934 . The stations call letters were later changed to WMGM; the station is today's WFAN, while WEPN replaced it on the frequency.

She was selected as by the Australian military as the commander of the squad of super powered operatives to face unusual situations. She carries no weapons preferring to take those from her enemies in the midst of combat, she wears a uniform made from a polymer fabric developed by the CSIRO that is impervious to small arms fire but does not restrict movement. * Nightfighter, a former Australian soldier, Adam West, volunteered to be part of a program to create a super soldier. A virus introduced into his bloodstream allows him to gain super strength when adrenaline runs through his body (whenever he is angry, stressed, or afraid). He is a beer-swilling ocker from Melbourne, who according to his creator, David de Vries, is a combination of Hulk and Batman. The Nightfighter's battle cry being \\"Hold on to your braincells!\\", a homage to the Thing's trademark \\"It's clobbering time\\". * Southern Cross, a young, trendy North Shore fashion designer, Bertram Davis, from Sydney with psychokinetic powers. His ability has been significantly amplified by an implant (developed by the CSIRO), that works in conjunction with his cane as a power supply, allowing him to fly at high speeds and move heavy objects. * Dingo, Costas Borgas, is the werewolf son of a Serbian immigrant. Dingo fills a similar sort of role to that of the Beast in X-Men, or the Thing in the Fantastic Four, according to his creator, David de Vries. Front cover of The Southern Squadron #13 The Southern Squadron was formed by the government of Australia, in 1982, to deal with superpowered crime and to give local superheroes guidance, training and legal authority. The Southern Squadron are based in Canberra, Australia. They cooperate closely with their New Zealand counterparts, the Waitangi Rangers. The supervisor/advisor to the squadron is Colonel Ralph Rivers (formerly the Crimson Comet, a winged superhero from the golden age of Australian comics). The squadron is occasionally joined by Flash Damingo, an alien bi-pedal platypus with a cybernetic arm - a former member of the Space Rangers. The Southern Squadron was also published in America as two four issue mini-series, The Southern Squadron (1990) from Aircel and The Southern Squadron: Freedom of Information Act (1992) from Eternity, reprinting stories from the original Australian stories as well as introducing entirely new material. =Dark Nebula= Front cover of Dark Nebula #1 The Dark Nebula receives his powers from the two souls occupy the dead body of Colonel Mark Medula, an Australian astronaut, who on returning from a routine shuttle mission, encounters an alien war lord, Cerellus of the planet Caileu. Medula and Cerellus battle and kill each other and when their souls are brought before Death for final consignment they are instead melded within Medula’s body. From Cerellus he receives psionic abilities (telepathy, telekinesis etc.), from Medula he receives the dark fire (a powerful mystical force, which although Medula is unaware of it at the time he is descended from a long line of witches). There is a constant battle for control of the host body with Cerellus constantly attempting to take over Medula's body at every opportunity. The character debuted in a graphic novel titled The Dynamic Dark Nebula in 1982. The character subsequently appeared in Cyclone! for eight issues before being given its own respective title in February 1989. The Dark Nebula ran for eight issues, with The Golden Age Southern Cross as the back-up feature. The character was then included in several short stories in Southern Aurora Comics Presents. =The Jackaroo= Front cover of Jackaroo #1 The Jackaroo is Jack Keegan, a hard-nosed, adaptive bare-knuckles fighter. The character first appeared in issue #5 of Cyclone!, published in January 1989. The Jackaroo was given his own title in May 1989, whilst it was intended to be a three issue mini-series only a single issue was published. The Jackaroo was also released as a three issue mini-series published by the American company Eternity Comics, reworked from various stories originally published in Australia. The character also appeared in issue #17 of Ninja High School published in February 1990. Subsequent publications In 1989 Cyclone Comics also published a limited run called G.I. Joe Australia, reprinting stories from the Marvel series with some additional Australian material. The Cyclone name returned in 1992 when Gary Chaloner launched Cyclone Comics Quarterly with new characters. It ran for four issues. The first issue included a solo adventure of Flash Damingo, an occasional member of Southern Squadron, and a new character Morton Stone: Undertaker. The original Cyclone! Characters have undergone something of a revival with the launching of The Dark Nebula webcomic in 2006. The website has been operation for a little over two years. This webcomic currently includes Dark Nebula, the Golden Age Southern Cross and The Southern Squadron. The new series of The Dark Nebula, The Southern Cross & The Southern Squadron graphic novels are also available on-line through Web Comics Nation.

The 1997 U.S. Cup included the host United States, Mexico, Peru and Denmark.The Danish Football Association registrered the games as unofficial, and comprised the team of players from the domestic Danish Superliga championship. Staged as a six-game, round robin tournament, the team with the best win-loss record took the title. This was the only U.S. Cup for both Peru and Denmark, and the third for Mexico. They had won the previous cup and would go on to win this one and the 1999 edition. USSF organized the 1997 cup as three doubleheaders. On January 17, 1997, Denmark played Mexico and the U.S. played Peru. Two days later, Peru took on Denmark, while the U.S. played arch-rival Mexico. On the last day of the cup, January 22, Mexico played Peru and the U.S. hosted Denmark. January 17: First Doubleheader In the first game of the tournament, the U.S. took on Peru in San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium. Peru struck early, when German Carty scored in the 8th minute off a Paolo Maldonado cross. Peru dominated the first half possession, but the U.S. dominated long stretches of the second half.

He was killed in an attack by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in the town of Borovo Naselje. Early life Blago Zadro was born in the small village of Donji Mamići near Grude in western Herzegovina. His family moved to Borovo Naselje, an industrial district of Vukovar, in 1954 where he graduated high school and started working in the Borovo combine. He had a job mixing chemicals and rubber.Central Intelligence Agency Office of Russian and European Analysis (2000). Balkan Battlegrounds: A Military History of the Yugoslav Conflict, 1990–1995: Volume 2. Washington, D.C.; p. 197 In 1968 he married Katica Soldo, also an employee of Borovo. They had three sons: Robert, Tomislav, and Josip. Zadro was interested in Croatian history, particularly the Bleiburg repatriations, and was not a supporter of the Communist authorities. In early 1990, due to mismanagement of the Borovo conglomerate, Zadro organized strikes and asked for the dismissal of the director. Zadro became active in politics during Croatia's first democratic election in 1990; he founded a branch of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) for Municipality of Vukovar and became the vice president of the HDZ in Vukovar. After his department was closed, he spent three months in the reorganized Croatian police force in Vinkovci. He joined the Croatian National Guard when the war started. Battle of Vukovar Blago Zadro (middle) on the Trpinja road during the Battle of Vukovar Blago Zadro's grave Bust of Blago Zadro in Vukovar Zadro had commanded the 3rd Battalion of the 204th (Vukovar) Croatian Army Brigade during Battle of Vukovar since the start of the fighting, along with two of his sons, where he led actions against the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and local Serb forces. Zadro's unit was assigned to defend the vital Trpinjska cesta (Trpinja road), an open road leading directly into Vukovar. Because of its importance, the road became primary target for JNA tank units attacking the city and it became known as the tank graveyard due to actions of Zadro's anti-tank rocket groups Yellow Ants and Turbo platoon which fought off many tank attacks, notably a single incident on 18 September when an entire battalion of about 60 tanks and armored personnel carriers was ambushed and destroyed there. Zadro was killed by Serb forces on 16 October 1991. His body was recovered and buried by his unit. When the Serb forces surrendered the city, his body was removed and remained missing until 1998, when it was found along with the bodies of 937 other victims from a mass grave in Borovo Naselje. After his death, he was promoted to the rank of major general. Legacy Blago Zadro Memorial in Vukovar, Trpinjska Street President of Sabor Vladimir Šeks stated \\"without heroes like Blago Zadro, there would be no free Croatia\\". A commemoration for him is held every year on the anniversary of his death in Vukovar, attended by many former comrades and political dignitaries. The main street in Borovo Naselje and a military school in Zagreb have been named after him. A street in Grude was named after him and in his birth village Donji Mamići was placed a monument in his tribute.

The primary purpose of the EBIF content format is to represent an optimized collection of widget and byte code specifications that define one or more multimedia pages, similar to web pages, but specialized for use within an enhanced television or interactive television system. An EBIF resource (file), i.e., a sequence of bytes that conforms to the EBIF content format, forms the primary information contained in an ETV Application. An ETV User Agent acquires, decodes, presents (widgets), and executes (actions) contained in an EBIF resource in order to present a multimedia page to an end-user. Other types of more specialized EBIF resources play auxiliary roles to this principal role of encoding viewable and interactive pages.  Common Resource Format  An EBIF resource consists of the following components: * Resource Header * Optional Common Section * Optional Platform Section 1...N A common or platform section of an EBIF resource consists of the following constructs: * Section Header * Table Directory * Table 0...N-1 * Optional Heap  Tables  The following table types are defined for use with EBIF: * Action * Generic Data * Metadata * Palette * Platform Directory * Reference * Resource Locator * Trigger * Widget In addition to the above, an EBIF resource may include one or more private use tables that may be interpreted or used by specific user agents.  Widgets  The following types of widgets are defined for use with EBIF: * Button * Collection * Container * Form * Hidden * Hot Spot * Image * Multi-Line Text * Page * Private Use * Radio * Radio Group Container * Rectangle * Selector * Text * Text Input * Timer * Video  Actions  In an EBIF resource, programmatic (procedural) information takes the form of byte code, where each operation and its (optional) operands is referred to as an action. Actions are organized into sequences by means of one or more action tables where each entry points at (1) an encoded action and (2) the action table index of the next action to execute after the current action's execution is completed. An action sequence terminates when the next action table index is a special value (0xFFFF) or in the case of certain flow of control actions. Action sequences effectively represent one or more traditional code blocks with potential internal looping behavior. Action sequences are executed as a result of firing certain predefined events, such as a page load event, a key press event, a click event, etc. As such, all programmatic execution takes place in the context of event handlers, whose execution is serialized by an ETV User Agent. The following categories of actions are defined by EBIF: * Flow of Control Actions * Predicate Actions * Variable Store Actions * Arithmetic Actions * Boolean Logic Actions * Mathematic Actions * String Actions * Array Actions * Application and Page Actions * Widget Actions * Table Actions * Miscellaneous Actions = Memory Model = The action memory model is based on a variable store, and does not make use of registers or a stack. With the exception of one predefined, internal result value variable, all variables are preallocated (and typed) at compilation time. These variables are represented in the form of a table referred to as an augmented reference table, where the content of the table is initialized at compilation time, then stored and mutated at runtime by an ETV User Agent. = Execution Model = The action execution model is based on the decoding and processing of action sequences that serve as event handlers. Execution of action sequences are serialized through the sequential dispatching of events to event handlers, completing the execution of an action sequence functioning as an event handler before executing any other applicable event handlers (for that event) and before processing any other enqueued event.

It is assigned to the Tenth Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and is stationed at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The 419th FW is an associate unit of the 388th Fighter Wing, Air Combat Command (ACC) and if mobilized the wing is gained by ACC. Overview The mission of the wing is to Fly, Fight and Win. To accomplish that mission, the wing trains and equips an F-16 squadron to be capable of worldwide mobility to perform a wide variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground fighter missions. 419th members are trained in a variety of specialties to include operations, maintenance, civil engineering, security, supply, transportation and communications. The wing was the last wing to fly F-105 aircraft, and in early 1984 was the first Air Force Reserve wing to fly F-16s. Personnel of the 419th deploy periodically for contingencies and training exercises, some overseas. Some 350 members were deployed December 1994 through February 1995 to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey to patrol the no-fly zone over northern Iraq during Operation Provide Comfort II. In 2015, it transitioned to an Associate unit and became the first Air Force Reserve fighter wing to fly the F-35A Lightning II. Units The 419th Fighter Wing is divided into three subordinate groups which supervise nine squadrons and four flights. Additionally, the wing oversees a medical squadron that reports directly to the commander. Several staff agencies such as plans, safety, quality, financial management, public affairs and the legal office form the wing commander's headquarters section staff. * The 419th Operations Group plans and organizes operational programs and establishes policies and procedures for operational training functions. It directs, monitors and supports operations programs, including flight operations, standardization/evaluation, weapons and tactics, intelligence, operations and training and life support. The wing's designated flying squadron is the 466th Fighter Squadron. Pilots from the unit train for both air-to-air and air-to- ground attack missions in the F-16 C/D model aircraft. * The 419th Maintenance Group plans, organizes and establishes programs, policies and procedures in support of the unit's flying missions and contingency operations. Subordinate units include the 419th Maintenance Squadron, the 419th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, and 419th Maintenance Operations Flight. These units train personnel, provide required resources at home and deployed locations, and maintain the wing's aircraft. The 419th Combat Logistics Support Squadron also falls under the Maintenance Group. Its wartime mission is to deploy teams worldwide to accomplish rapid Aircraft Battle Damage Repair and packing operations. * The 419th Mission Support Group provides non-tactical support for the operational mission of the 419th Fighter Wing. It provides programs and support to the Security Forces, Communications, Civil Engineer and Mission Support Squadrons. The 419th Security Forces Squadron provides resource protection, system security and base defense missions. The 419th Civil Engineer Squadron provides pre-attack and post-attack civil engineering support necessary to maintain aircraft operations. The 419th Mission Support Flight provides administrative support for the operational mission of the wing. The 419th Logistics Readiness Squadron is responsible for managing personnel and materiel resources. The 67th Aerial Port Squadron also falls under the Mission Support Group. Its members load and unload air freight arriving from and departing for points worldwide. History The 419th Group trained in the Reserve for troop carrier operations from 1949 to 1951. The Air Force Reserve has maintained a flying mission at Hill Air Force Base for more than 45 years. When activated in March 1947, the 419th Group was earmarked to control seven Reserve units, the first of which was a rescue squadron. During a two-year period, the 419th Group gained several components, spanning five separate locations and three Air Force organizations. Group pilots trained until March 1951 when training ceased and the entire 419th prepared for entry into active service. Activated in July 1956 as a component of the Regular Air Force, the group and its three squadrons trained in C-123 Provider assault airlift operations. Over the next several years, the wing logged missions in the T-33 Shooting Star, F-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet, C-119 Flying Boxcar, C-124 Globemaster II and C-46 Commando aircraft. The 24-ship flyover formation, Diamonds on Diamonds, was used at the F-105 retirement at Hill Air Force Base in 1985 In 1972, the Air Force Reserve modernization program added fighter aircraft which resulted in the unit gaining F-105 Thunderchief aircraft. Consequently, the unit was re-designated the 508th Fighter Group. On 1 October 1982, the unit was upgraded from a group to a wing, being redesignated the 419th Tactical Fighter Wing. It was the last operational F-105 unit in the Air Force until its conversion to F-16s in January 1984. More than one hundred 419th members were called to active duty in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm (1991–1992). They served in Saudi Arabia, Europe and at stateside military installations. Approximately 350 members of the 419th Fighter Wing deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, in support of Operation Provide Comfort II from 3 December 1994 through 16 February 1995. The wing's pilots flew more than 500 sorties, compiling more than 1,400 flight hours enforcing the no-fly zone over northern Iraq. The wing demonstrated its combat capability in a return trip to Incirlik Air Base in June 1997 to support Operation Northern Watch. The unit's show of force was significant as it deployed 12 aircraft and nearly 400 people to the region to deter the Iraqi military from terrorizing its neighbors. In 1998, the 466th Fighter Squadron deployed 6 aircraft and 93 Reservists to Kuwait in support of Operation Southern Watch. In June 1999, the 419th Fighter Wing's deployment to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey marked the first time the Reserve supported a contingency operation by employing precision-guided munitions. After being fired upon by the Iraqi military, pilots utilized Low Altitude Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) technology to destroy enemy targets with pinpoint accuracy. 419th FW members deployed to Incirlik Air Base in June 2000 where they became the first Reserve unit ever to use a new precision strike capability known as LITENING II in a contingency operation. Their F-16s equipped with the LITENING II technology, 419th pilots helped keep the Iraqi military in check flying 95 combat missions over a 28-day period. In October 2001, the 419th returned to the Middle East as part of Air Expeditionary Force-8. Wing members used the LITENING II precision strike capability to enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq for 19 days. While deployed, 419th pilots assisted in the United States' war on terrorism by logging combat missions over Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. That same month, 419th Security Forces members and Civil Engineers were mobilized and spent 18 months providing security at Air Force installations stateside and overseas. Members of the wing's 466th Fighter Squadron supported the North American Aerospace Defense Command by flying combat air patrols at undisclosed locations from 21 December 2001 to 1 January 2002. The wing filled each 8-hour CAP responsibility by utilizing volunteer Reservists and Air Reserve Technicians. In January 2003, over 100 members of the 419th departed Utah to enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. Once deployed, members were called to active-duty to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the war, pilots delivered precision-guided weapons on Iraqi command and control facilities, munitions bunkers, radar sites and other key military targets. Several members earned Bronze Star awards and Distinguished Flying Crosses (with heroism) for their actions. Reservists from the 419th Medical Squadron, 419th Security Forces Squadron and 67th Aerial Port Squadron all supported contingency operations in Iraq in 2004. =Lineage= * Established as 419th Troop Carrier Wing, Medium on 10 May 1949 : Activated in the Reserve on 27 June 1949 : Ordered to active duty on 1 May 1951 : Inactivated on 2 May 1951 * Re-designated 419th Tactical Fighter Wing on 22 February 1982 : Activated in the Reserve on 1 October 1982 : Re-designated 419th Fighter Wing on 1 February 1992. =Assignments= * Tenth Air Force, 27 Jun 1949 – 2 May 1951; 1 Oct 1982 – present =Components= Groups * 419th Troop Carrier (later, 419th Operations) Group: 27 Jun 1949 – 2 May 1951; 1 Aug 1992 – present * 507th Tactical Fighter Group, 1 Oct 1982 – 1 Apr 1994 * 944th Tactical Fighter Group, 1 Jul 1987 – 1 Oct 1994 Squadrons * 466th Tactical Fighter (later Fighter) Squadron, 1 Oct 1982 – 1 Aug 1992 Stations *Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, (27 June 1949 – 2 May 1951) *Hill Air Force Base, Utah, (1 October 1982 – present) Aircraft operated *F-35 Lightning II, (2015–present) *F-16 Fighting Falcon, (1984–2017) *F-4 Phantom II, (1982–1988) *F-105 Thunderchief, (1982–1984) *C/TC-46 Commando, (1949–1951) *AT-6 Texan, AT-7 Navigator, and AT-11 Kansan, (1947–1951) Commanders *Colonel Matthew M.

In the earliest automotive engines, the valves needed to be removed and the sealing surfaces sanded, ground or lapped multiple times during the life of a typical engine. As the decades passed, however, engines ran cleaner and the addition of tetraethyllead in gasoline meant that such maintenance became less frequent. Today, valve jobs are rarely done on passenger cars for the purpose of maintenance, although they are still quite common with high-performance cars. Some reasons that may induce the need for a valve job in a modern passenger car include: excessive RPM, high mileage, overheating, material failure, corrosion, and foreign object damage (FOD). A valve job is best done with grinding stones and either electric or pneumatic tools. Lapping compound and a lapping tool may be used, and is more economical for home auto repair, however lapping will only provide limited results and will not be effective on a valve or seat with anything more than very light wear or damage. Modern engines have cylinder heads made of either iron or aluminum. Iron cylinder heads most often have integral iron valve seats. These seats are the softest and most susceptible to wear among modern engine. Aluminum cylinder heads, however, have hardened steel valve seats, as aluminum would make a very poor seat. These hardened steel seats are significantly better than the integral seats of an iron head, and can be relatively easily removed and replaced if needed. If an integral iron seat needs to be replaced, the seat must be milled to allow the insert of a new seat. The new seat is then installed with application of a high-strength metal glue/adhesive. Once installed, the seat is ground to the correct angle and width. Valves and seats will usually have the same angle to mate properly. That angle is usually 45 degrees, but 30 degrees can be found in many modern applications. The mating angle is often accompanied by top and bottom angle cuts that are 15 degrees from each side of the mating angle (e.g. for a 45 degree seat, the top and bottom angles would be 30 and 60 degrees respectively). This method increases air-flow, which gives mild horsepower, response, and efficiency improvements. The seat mating angle of an intake seat will typically be one-half the width of the valve face (on a stock engine). High performance applications will often have a very thin intake mating seat of approximately .025\\" to .030\\". Exhaust seats should be about .060\\" less than the valve face, with the mating surface of the seat being .030\\" from both top and bottom of the valve face (putting the mating of the two in the middle of the valve face). Valves should be inspected for damage which will prevent proper operation and could lead to catastrophic failure. Cracking, pitting, channeling, and burning are typical problems leading to valve replacement. Even hair-line cracks make a valve unusable. Pitting is permissible in small amounts, but should not be present on the face, margin, or stem. Channeling is a result of uneven heating of a valve (typically from improper seating during operation), and is evident by heat discoloration in an oval shape on the bottom of the valve and often visible at the base of the valve stem. Channeling that continues will lead to a burnt valve, which leads to melting away of a portion of the valve. If an engine is subjected to excessive RPM or sudden stoppage, all valves should be inspected for straightness. If a valve is bent, it will lead to failure very quickly and often damage other parts such as pistons, cylinder walls, other valves, valve guides, and valve-train components. Some older cars have relatively soft valve seats that wear faster when operated without leaded fuel. These usually can be updated with hardened valve seats that resist wear, regardless of whether leaded or unleaded fuel is used.

He and his brother were afforded their position in the March of Neustria both by kinship to Adalard the Seneschal and the favour of Charles the Bald. With his brothers, Berengar and Waldo, Abbot of St Maximin's, Trier, he took part in the 861 revolt of Carloman of Bavaria, possibly his cousin-in-law, against Louis the German. The revolt was crushed, and the three brothers fled with their relative Adalard to the court of the West Frankish king, Charles the Bald, who granted them wardship of the march held against the Vikings while the march against the Bretons was granted to Robert the Strong. Charles' patronage of the family provoked the jealousy of the Rorgonids, the most powerful family local to Neustria, which controlled the ducatus Cenomannicus (Maine). In 865, they allied with Saloman of Brittany and attacked the brothers. Charles, to attain peace, took the march back and gave it to Gauzfrid of Neustria, a Rorgonid. A charter of 879 mentions Udo and his brothers taking part in the foundation of the college of Gemünden. Evidently, the death of Louis the German in 876 had allowed them to return to the court of Carloman. Udo left a son, Conrad, Duke of Thuringia, who was the founder of the Conradine dynasty and father of Conrad I of Germany. One younger son, Rudolf, became Bishop of Würzburg, and another, Gebhard, became Duke of Lotharingia.

It is housed within a disused 1867 primary school, built in Victorian Gothic style. The theatre was founded in 1971 by its previous artistic director, Sam Walters, and his actress wife Auriol Smith in a small room above the Orange Tree pub opposite the present building, which opened in 1991. Paul Miller, previously associate director at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, is the artistic director. He succeeded Walters, the UK's longest-serving theatre director, who retired from the Orange Tree Theatre in June 2014. The Orange Tree Theatre specialises in staging new plays and rediscovering classics. It has an education and participation programme that reaches over 10,000 people every year. Since 2014 the theatre has won ten Offies (Off West End Awards), five UK Theatre Awards and the Alfred Fagon Audience Award. It won the Empty Space Peter Brook Award in 2006 and 2015. The first Orange Tree Theatre As a company the Orange Tree Theatre, then known as the Richmond Fringe, was founded on 31 December 1971 by Sam Walters and Auriol Smith in a small room above The Orange Tree pub, close to Richmond railway station. Six former church pews, arranged around the performing area, were used to seat an audience of up to 80 in number. Initially productions were staged in daylight and at lunchtimes. However, when theatre lighting and window-blinds were installed, matinee and evening performances of full-length plays also became possible. The London critics regularly reviewed its productions and the venue gained a reputation for quality and innovation, with theatregoers queuing on the stairs, waiting to purchase tickets. The new Orange Tree Theatre The new theatre and the 2003 extension As audience numbers increased there was pressure to find a more accommodating space, both front and backstage. On 14 February 1991, the company opened its first production across the road in the current premises, the new Orange Tree Theatre. The theatre is housed within a converted primary school, St John's, which had been built in 1867 and had become derelict; the school was in Victorian Gothic style and the architect is likely to have been Arthur Blomfield. Meanwhile, the original theatre, renamed The Room (above the pub), continued to function as a second stage for shorter runs and works in translation until 1997. =Design and conversion= The school conversion and construction design were undertaken by Iain Mackintosh as head of the Theatre Projects Consultants team. The design intent was to retain the same sense of intimacy as the old theatre, thus calling for an unusually small acting area. The solution was to create, at stage level, no more than three rows of shallow raked seating on any side of the acting area, plus an irregular, timber-clad gallery above of only one row (which helps to \\"paper the wall with people\\") under which actors could circulate on two sides to reach the stage entrances at all four corners of the playing space. Foyers and dressing rooms were sited in the rebuilt house of the former headmaster, while the theatre space itself is built where once were the assembly hall and school playground. Any fears that the special atmosphere of the old theatre would be lost proved unfounded, and close links were formed with the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, also founded as an in-the-round theatre by Sir Alan Ayckbourn. £750,000 was raised by an appeal, launched in 1988 by Richmond residents Sir Richard and Lady Attenborough. =2003 extension= In 2003 the former Royal Bank of Scotland building next door to the new theatre was modified and re-opened as a dedicated space for rehearsals, set-building and costume storage, significantly expanding and improving its operation. =Arts Council funding= In July 2014, Arts Council England removed the theatre from its list of National Portfolio Organisations for 2015–2018 which means the theatre has to bridge the funding gap with that from external sources. In July 2016, Arts Council England announced that it would be awarding £75,000 to the Orange Tree Theatre over the next three years as part of the Catalyst: Evolve fund which matches fundraised income. Repertory As well as producing the first six plays by Martin Crimp, plays by Susan Glaspell and developing a reputation for theatrical rediscoveries, the Orange Tree repertory has also included many special seasons for the work of James Saunders, Michel Vinaver, Rodney Ackland, Václav Havel, Harley Granville Barker and Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries, including John Galsworthy. In Paul Miller's first season he presented revivals of plays by George Bernard Shaw, DH Lawrence and Doris Lessing as well as premiering plays by Alistair McDowall, Deborah Bruce and Alice Birch. The theatre's 2014 production of Alistair McDowall's Pomona was well received by the critics and it transferred to the National Theatre and Royal Exchange Theatre in autumn 2015. Terence Rattigan's French Without Tears played two sell-out runs at the theatre then went on a UK tour with English Touring Theatre. Other rediscoveries include work by Robert Holman, Sharman Macdonald, Clare McIntyre and Caryl Churchill. New plays have included the world premieres of Jess and Joe Forever by Zoe Cooper and The Brink by Brad Birch, the UK premiere of Winter Solstice by Roland Schimmelpfennig and the European premiere of An Octoroon by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. Training directors From 1986 to 2014 the theatre ran a trainee director scheme, each year appointing two young assistant directors. Graduates of this scheme included Rachel Kavanaugh, Timothy Sheader, Sean Holmes, Dominic Hill, and Anthony Clark. This was replaced by a Resident Director position in 2014/15. The Orange Tree currently runs an MA in Theatre Directing with St Mary's University, Twickenham which started in 2016-17. Awards Since 2014 the theatre has won ten Offies (Off West End Awards), five UK Theatre Awards and the Alfred Fagon Audience Award. The Orange Tree Theatre won the Empty Space Peter Brook Award in 2006 and 2015. In 2017 it was the Lonodon regional winner for UK's Most Welcoming Theatre Award 2017.

A part of the United States Colored Troops, the regiment saw action in Virginia as part of the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign and in North Carolina, where it participated in the attacks on Fort Fisher and Wilmington and the Carolinas Campaign. History After a month and a half of organization, from July 28 to September 12, 1863, at Camp William Penn, Pennsylvania, the 6th Regiment was sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia, on October 14, 1863, and from there to Yorktown, Virginia, where it remained until April 1864. While at Yorktown, the unit was involved in several expeditions as part of the XVIII Corps: Wild's Expedition to South Mills and Camden Court House, North Carolina, from December 5 to December 24, 1863, Wistar's Expedition against Richmond from February 2 to February 6, 1864, an expedition to New Kent Court House in aid of Brigadier General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry from March 1 to March 4 (including action at New Kent Court House on March 2 and at Williamsburg on March 4), an expedition into King and Queen County from March 9 to March 12, and an expedition into Mathews County from March 17 to March 21. Starting on May 4, 1864, the 6th Regiment participated in Brigadier General Benjamin F. Butler's operations on the south side of the James River and against Petersburg and Richmond. The unit was involved in the capture of City Point, Virginia, on May 4 and while in the city served fatigue duty, built Fort Converse on the Appomattox River, and defended an attack against Fort Converse on May 20. The unit participated in action at Bailor's Farm on June 15, 1864, before taking part in the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign until December 17. The 6th served in the trenches around Petersburg up to June 18 and then did fatigue duty at Dutch Gap Canal until August 27, 1864. From there, the regiment moved to Deep Bottom and later participated in heavy action during the Battle of Chaffin's Farm at Fort Harrison on September 29 and September 30. After taking part in the Battle of Fair Oaks from October 27 to October 28, the unit returned to the trenches, this time near Richmond, where it remained until December 1864. In December the unit was assigned to the newly formed XXV Corps and took part in the failed attack on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, from December 7 to December 27, 1864, and the successful Second Battle of Fort Fisher from January 7 to January 15, 1865, including the bombardment of the fort starting on the 13th and the final assault and capture on the 15th. The 6th then saw action at Sugar Loaf Hill on January 19 and at Sugar Loaf Battery on February 11 before taking part in the Battle of Wilmington at Fort Anderson from February 18 to February 20 and the capture of Wilmington as well as action at Northeast Ferry on February 22, 1865. In March 1865, the 6th Regiment was reassigned to the X Corps and took part in General William Tecumseh Sherman's Carolinas Campaign. The unit saw action during the advance on Kinston and Goldsboro, North Carolina, starting on March 6 and occupied Goldsboro after its capture on March 21. The regiment saw further action at Cox's Bridge on March 23 and March 24 and participated in the advance on Raleigh, North Carolina, starting on April 9 and the occupation of Raleigh after the city's fall on April 14. With the end of the war at hand, the men of the 6th witnessed the surrender of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston and his army at Bennett Place, North Carolina, on April 26, 1865. The unit served out the rest of its term in the Department of North Carolina. The 6th was mustered out on September 20, 1865, after two years of existence. The regiment lost a total of 224 men during its service; eight officers and 79 enlisted men were killed or mortally wounded and five officers and 132 enlisted men died of disease.

He was a grandson of King Chulalongkorn, the maternal grandfather of Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara and an uncle of director Chatrichalerm Yukol. His nickname was Sadet Ong Chaiyai. Biography =Early life and career= Prince Bhanubandhu was the eldest of three children of Prince Yugala Dighambara and Princess Chalermkhet Mongkhol. He was a grandson of King Chulalongkorn. He was educated in Thailand at Thepsirin School, and then in France. He also lived abroad in his youth in England and the United States. In his 20s, he returned to Thailand and enlisted in the Royal Thai Army's cavalry division. While in the army, he studied filmmaking in his spare time. In 1936, Prince Bhanubandhu's youngest brother, Prince Anusorn Mongkolkarn, founded the Lavoe Motion Pictures, and produced its first film, Naam Yok Ok (The Thorn in Your Side). Prince Bhanubandhu founded his own company, the Thai Film Company, in 1938, first producing the film, Tharn Fai Kao (The Old Flame). Four other films followed: Wan Phen, Mae Sue Sao (Girl Matchmaker), Pid Thong Lang Phru and Look Thung (The Folks). The company was disbanded during World War II, with its assets sold to the Royal Thai Air Force. Film historians believe that the films were destroyed during the war.\\"The Prince of Celluloid\\", The Nation, Focus, Section C, Saturday, February 11, 1995 (print edition from Nation archives). =Post- war years= After the war ended, Bhanubandhu formed a new production company, Assawin Pictures. Among his works were Phantay Norasingh (Oarsman Norasingh), which was based on a play he wrote in 1942. For the film version, he hired a then-budding cinematographer, Rattana Pestonji. Another film by Bhanubandhu was based on the legend of King Naresuan the Great. Bhanubandhu pushed for innovations in the Thai film industry, often spending his family's fortune to buy equipment for poorer directors. He encouraged the use of 35-mm film over 16-mm films, which was the industry standard in Thailand. He produced the first Thai film in CinemaScope, Ruen Phae (Raft Home), a co-production with Shaw Brothers Studio. Bhanubandhu also composed the score for his films. One of his songs from 1938's Tharn Fai Kao, was selected in 1979 by UNESCO as a \\"Song of Asia\\". \\"It was a sort of hobby that was professional,\\" the prince said about his work in an interview with Di-Chan magazine. \\"I could do it much better than a professional. I did the job all by myself, from composing the story, writing the script and shooting the film, to editing it all. It was tiring work, but I am the sort of person who is determined to do a thing until it is completed and at its best.\\" Family Prince Bhanubandhu was the eldest of three brothers. His younger brother was Prince Chalermbala Dighambara, while his youngest brother was Prince Anusorn Mongkolkarn, the father of director Chatrichalerm Yukol. Prince Bhanubandhu was married three times and had seven children. In his first marriage to Mom Luang Soiraya, he fathered Mom Chao Bhandhusawali Kitiyakara, the mother of Her Royal Highness Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara, the first wife of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. Other children were M.C. Thitibhan Yukol, M.C. Rangsinopphadol. Bhanubandhu then married Mom Boonlom, producing M.C. Bhuribhan Yukol. His third marriage to Mom Chailai (who was twenty when they married in 1976, he sixty-six) produced M.C. Peemai and M.C. Ying Yukol. Prince Bhanubandhu died at the age of 85 of blood poisoning.

A transport protein (variously referred to as a transmembrane pump, transporter, escort protein, acid transport protein, cation transport protein, or anion transport protein) is a protein that serves the function of moving other materials within an organism. Transport proteins are vital to the growth and life of all living things. There are several different kinds of transport proteins.

Carrier proteins are integral membrane proteins; that is, they exist within and span the membrane across which they transport substances. The proteins may assist in the movement of substances by facilitated diffusion (i.e., passive transport) or active transport. These mechanisms of movement are known as carrier-mediated transport.Thompson, Liz A. Passing the North Carolina End of Course Test for Biology. American Book Company, Inc. 2007. . pg. 97.

For 30 years, he constructed a puzzle every Sunday for the San Francisco Chronicle (originally the San Francisco Examiner), which he syndicated to more than 50 Sunday newspapers, including the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Seattle Times, The Plain Dealer (Cleveland, Ohio), the Hartford Courant, the New York Observer, and the Arizona Daily Star. Reagle also produced a bimonthly crossword puzzle for AARP The Magazine magazine, a monthly crossword puzzle for the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, and puzzles for the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. Biography Reagle was born in Audubon, New Jersey on January 5, 1950. He made his first crossword when he was six years old and sold a puzzle to The New York Times at age 16, a feat that made him the youngest published Times puzzle constructor at the time. He attended the University of Arizona, but dropped out a few credits short of a degree in English. Reagle first competed in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in 1979, its second year, and placed third. He submitted a puzzle to the contest starting in 1980 and, later, served as a tournament judge and a commentator for the tournament's finals. In the early 1980s Reagle began submitting crossword puzzles to Dell crossword magazine, Games magazine, and Margaret Farrar's Simon & Schuster books. He regarded crossword-making as more of a hobby, working as a television scriptwriter by day and a film scriptwriter by night. In 1985 he was contracted to produce a regular Sunday crossword for the San Francisco Examiners new Sunday magazine. Three years later, he went into syndication. In the 1990s Reagle was regarded as one of the top producers of a new type of crossword puzzle: \\"less stodgy and more hip.\\" This trend was encouraged by The New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz, who sought to appeal to a wider and younger readership with \\"pop culture references ... humorous word play, and ... unique and clever themes\\". In 2011 Reagle donated his expertise to produce an awareness-building campaign for the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. Reagle created the National Brain Game Challenge, an online contest featuring a Sunday crossword that contains a clued secret message. Cash prizes, including a first prize of $25,000, are awarded in two categories, \\"casual solver\\" and \\"puzzle professional\\". Reagle was one of the few crossword constructors who made a living solely through puzzlemaking, as he retained all rights to his puzzles. They are reprinted in books that he sold under his own imprint, PuzzleWorks. With the assistance of his wife, Marie Haley, he published more than 20 volumes of his Sunday crosswords, which he sold from his website. Merl and Marie made their home in the Tampa Bay, Florida area. Reagle died August 22, 2015, after being hospitalized two days earlier for acute pancreatitis. Representative puzzles: humor and wide-open grids The New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz has said that \\"his [Reagle's] themes are consistently fresher and funnier than anyone else's. And he's one of the greatest puzzlemakers at interlocking words in intricate, wide-open patterns\\". Games magazine has called Reagle \\"the best Sunday crossword creator in America\\".Games Magazine World of Puzzles, March 1995. A poll of puzzlemakers at cruciverb.com, a popular website for crossword constructors, ranked Reagle the most admired by his peers. His 2004 puzzle, \\"Wide Open Spaces\\", holds the record for the lowest word count (i.e., number of answers) in a Sunday puzzle. The 21 x 21 grid has only 112 words (with 51 black squares). The prolific crossword editor Stanley Newman called Reagle's puzzle \\"Gridlock\\" \\"the best single crossword of the last 25 years.\\"Newman, Stanley, ed. Crossworder's OWN Newsletter, June, 1990. \\"Gridlock\\" featured a \\"thick traffic jam of car names crossing in the center\\". His fellow constructors routinely credit Reagle for creating some of the funniest themes for his puzzles. One, called \\"Hit Song\\", was what he called \\"Sean Penn's version of \\"My Way\\". It included the theme entries I'M IN A / RUSH, NO PICTURES, PLEASE, OR / ELSE YOU'LL LEARN THE / BLACKENED EYE WAY / THE RECORD SHOWS / I'LL BUST YOUR / NOSE IF YOU GET IN... / MY WAY. Other much-discussed puzzles carried titles like \\"Inappropriate Muzak for a Doctor's Office\\" and \\"Least Popular Beanie Babies\\". Portrayal in Wordplay He was noted for making puzzles with pencil and paper, instead of with the aid of a computer. The 2006 documentary Wordplay depicted Reagle's on-camera construction of a crossword that subsequently was published in The New York Times. The film then showed various famous crossword enthusiasts, including Bill Clinton, Jon Stewart, the Indigo Girls, and Mike Mussina, attempting to solve the puzzle. Other appearances In the late 1960s and early 1970s Reagle was a member of a psychedelic rock band Greylock Mansion. He played the organ and performed the lead vocals and was also the main songwriter for the group. The band released two singles in their active period but never got a deal for a full album. All of their old recordings were finally released in 2016 by an underground label Lysergic Sound Distributors. Unfortunately Merl Reagle died during the production of the album and never got to witness its release.https://thisistucson.com/entertainment/music/the-musical-life-of-merl- reagle/article_3e01f68a-371f-5055-9f97-a66da5d4a71c.html On November 16, 2008, Reagle was a \\"special guest voice\\" on an episode of The Simpsons called \\"Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words.\\" In the episode, which featured a New York Times crossword, a cartoon version of Reagle appeared together with Shortz, and Lisa Simpson discovered secret messages embedded in both the clues and the puzzle, which Reagle constructed and Shortz edited. The actual crossword appearing that same day in the Times had the embedded messages. Reagle also was featured on CNN, the Today show, Nightline, Oprah, and National Public Radio. In 2013, the Washington Post featured an online interview in its \\"The Fold\\" feature.

Cast *Anouk Aimée as Justine *Dirk Bogarde as Pursewarden *Michael York as Darley *Robert Forster as Narouz *Anna Karina as Melissa *Philippe Noiret as Pombal *John Vernon as Nessim *Jack Albertson as Cohen *Cliff Gorman as Toto *George Baker as Mountolive *Elaine Church as Liza *Michael Constantine as Memlik Pasha *Marcel Dalio as French Consul General *Michael Dunn as Mnemjian *Barry Morse as Maskelyne *Danielle Roter as Drusilla Production The film's pre-production was prepared by director Joseph Strick, who intended to shoot the movie in Morocco. He did some location filming there, but fought with the executives at Fox and with star Anouk Aimée. When he did not hire others for the film as instructed by the studio and slept on the set while working on one of Aimee's scenes, they fired him and George Cukor was brought in. He proceeded to bring the film to Hollywood where the remainder of the film was finished. It became a financial flop and received critical reviews. Some scenes were shot at Ennejma Ezzahra, a palace at Sidi Bou Said, in northern Tunisia. Reception According to Fox records the film required $12,775,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $2,775,000. In September 1970 the studio reported it had lost $6,602,000 on the film.Silverman p 259 See also * List of American films of 1969 References  External links  * * Category:1969 films Category:1969 drama films Category:1960s LGBT-related films Category:American drama films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith Category:Films directed by George Cukor Category:Films directed by Joseph Strick Category:Films set in 1938 Category:Films set in Alexandria Category:American films ","title":"Justine (1969 film)"},{"id":"9497657","text":"The Jet Cage is a 1962 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on September 22, 1962, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. Voice actors are Mel Blanc (doing the voices of Sylvester, Tweety and Blackbird) and June Foray (doing the voice for Granny). The animation was by Gerry Chiniquy, Lee Halpern, Art Leonardi, Bob Matz and Virgil Ross. The layouts were designed by Hawley Pratt and the backgrounds by Tom O'Loughlin. The original music was composed by Milt Franklyn, who died during production, and an uncredited William Lava who completed Franklyn's unfinished score. Plot Tweety sits in his house, a bird cage, looking at the birds through the window. Tweety yearns dearly to fly freely like other birds, but not allowed to do so by Granny. That is considering his safety, as Sylvester is always lurking around waiting for a chance. Granny reads a newspaper advertisement by Jet Age Technology who has invented a $12.95 Flying Bird- Cage, which would allow birds fly safely. Granny, who understands Tweety's longing for freedom, decides to buy the cage and presents it to Tweety. This enables Tweety to fly around outdoors without leaving the security of his cage. Sylvester is at first taken aback at the sight of Tweety flying safely, piloting the jet-powered cage like an airplane. Two crows also watch in awe (\\"And all this time, I've been doing it the hard way,\\" one crow remarks). Sylvester resolves to ground Tweety's cage and get his meal; his eyes rolling around to follow his every move. Each of the following attempts are in vain: * An attempt to snare the cage with a butterfly catcher's net. The jet-powered cage is strong enough to drag the butterfly net, along with the cat hanging to it—until he crashes into a light pole. * After Tweety coming in for flying instructions (\\"I forgot what to do in case of fog!\\"), Sylvester sneaks inside the cage. Tweety eventually senses he's in trouble and releases the \\"bombs\\" into a river while in mid-air, just before Sylvester is about to strike. * Use of a rocket bomb to intercept the flying object of interest. The bomb simply flies back at the cat. * A horseshoe-shaped magnet tied to a fishing rod. While the cage momentarily struggles against the magnet's pull (and the puddy tries to reel in his meal), Tweety manages to get the cage to break free. Sylvester is dragged into downtown traffic and crashes into a bus. * Sylvester using large flaps to fly beside Tweety. Sylvester gloats, mocking the bird for thinking he outsmarted him, but Tweety points out that Sylvester has his hands full. The cat tosses the flaps aside and shoots back, \\"Well now I haven't!\\" ... just before he realizes he's in for a big fall! At the end, Sylvester—limping on crutches and heavily bandaged—decides to join the U.S. Air Force, vowing to earn his wings and get Tweety once and for all (“Watch out, bird!”).Ironically Sylvester is the emblem of two actual Air Force Squadrons: the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron and the 151st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. Throughout the cartoon, the sound effects for the jet cage's engines are more appropriate to a propeller-driven aircraft, and so is the terminology Tweety uses when he reads aloud from the pilot's manual.

He was elected as a representative in the Hawaii Legislature in 1954. Born in the Philippines, Aduja emigrated to Hawaii in his youth, and then served in the United States Army during World War II. After World War II, he worked as a teacher, before becoming one of the first Filipino lawyers in Hawaii. After two years in elected office, he worked for the Hawaiian Department of Attorney General, and served two years as a judge, until being elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives. Aduja died in Las Vegas in 2007. Early life Aduja was born in Ilocos Sur in the Philippines and emigrated with his family at the age of eight to Hilo, Hawaii. He was raised in nearby Hakalau, Hawaii, while his father worked on a sugarcane plantation as a sakada. He attended Hilo High, where he was the student body president and an Eagle Scout, graduating with the class of 1941 as salutatorian. After high school, he went on to the University of Hawaii to major in government and history; while attending university Aduja worked as a timekeeper at Pearl Harbor. In 1944, he joined the United States Army, and along with 50 other individuals volunteered for the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment. Following World War II he married Melodie \\"Lesing\\" Cabalona (died 2002). He taught on the island of Hawaii, at Naalehu Intermediate School, before attending Boston University, where he earned a law degree in 1951. In 1953, along with Ben Menor (later a justice on Hawaii's Supreme Court), Aduja took the bar examination, and both became Hawaii's first Filipino lawyers. Political career In 1954, Aduja was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives, becoming the first Filipino to be elected to public office in Hawaii and the United States. He represented one of three seats of the island of Hawaii. In 1956, he spoke on behalf of the Republican Party at the ILWU territorial convention in Hilo. After a single term in office, he went on to work for the Department of Attorney General. In 1959, he ran for State Senate from Oahu, a year when fellow Republican William F. Quinn was elected as the state's first governor, and lost. From 1960 to 1962, he was a district court judge, resigning from the bench in June 1962. After two years out of the public sector, in 1966, he was elected again to public office, this time as a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives. His district included Kailua, the North Shore, and Kahuku. While a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives, he was a delegate at the Hawaii State Constitution's 1968 constitutional convention. Aduja departed the Hawaii House of Representatives in 1974, and returned to the public sector in his final position as a member of the City of Honolulu's Kaneohe Neighborhood Board, which he was on from 1986 until 1994. Later years In 1991, Professor Dan Boylan wrote that Aduja was one of three important Filipino politicians in Hawaii during the beginning era of Filipino politics in Hawaii. Alt URL Along with Alfred Laureta and Ben Menor, and a few others minor individuals, they were the few Filipinos in elected office or in significant public office in Hawaii in the mid-20th century. On 19 February 2007, he died while on vacation in Las Vegas. Governor Linda Lingle declared 29 March 2007 to be Peter A. Aduja Day. Aduja was survived by two children (one of whom is former Hawaii state senator Melodie Aduja) and two grandchildren.

He wrote poetry, novels and plays and was a contributor to many periodicals. Life and work Brough was born on 10 April 1828 in London, the son of Barnabas Brough (c. 1795-1854), a brewer and wine merchant and Frances Whiteside, a poet. His brothers were William, also a playwright, John Cargill Brough (1834–1872), a science writer, and Lionel, a comic actor. The family moved to Pontypool in Monmouthshire, where his father ran a brewery and public house. His father was briefly kidnapped by the Chartists in 1839 and was a crown witness at the trial of the Chartist leader John Frost, which resulted in Frost's deportation to Australia. The family was ostracized and ruined financially as a result, and moved to Manchester in 1843, where Brough worked as a clerk in order to contribute to the family income.Banerji, Nilanjana. \\"Brough, Lionel (1836–1909)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 May 2009 In 1847, Brough established the Liverpool Lion, a comic periodical, writing satiric articles and drawings. He worked with his brother William to write a Victorian burlesque play, The Enchanted Isle, which was produced in Liverpool in 1848 before transferring to London. Moving to London, he wrote other successful burlesques including Medea (1856) and Masaniello (1857), as well as other collaborative productions with his brother William including The Sphinx (1849) and The Last Edition of Ivanhoe (1850). Brough also wrote essays and poems for journals and newspapers, including for a period being the Brussels correspondent of the Sunday Times. Songs of the Governing Classes (1855), a book of radical poems, is his best known work. In it, Brough critiqued the handling of the Crimean war and launched an attack on the upper classes through his satiric fictional portraits of aristocratic figures. Brough also penned a parody of Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Raven\\" called \\"The Vulture; An Ornithological Study\\" which was published in the December 1853 issue of Graham's Magazine, though he was not credited. The poem was later reprinted in William Evans Burton's Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor (1858), this time with his name attached. It was also published, however, a year earlier on the front page of the December 18, 1852 edition of The Carpet-Bag in Boston. In this earlier printing, it was also not credited, but this attribution to Brough is therefore uncertain. He also published much- praised translations of poetry, including those of Victor Hugo. In 1860 Robert Brough edited the magazine the Welcome Guest for John Maxwell, and was editor at the time of the first contribution by Mary Elizabeth Braddon. In 1859 Brough published a short story entitled \\"Calmuck\\" in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words. It was a thinly disguised account of William Holman Hunt's experience painting his picture The Hireling Shepherd and of his relations with his model Emma Watkins. Hunt wrote an outraged letter to Dickens, who claimed to be unaware that the story was based on real events.M. C. Rintoul, Dictionary of real people and places in fiction, Taylor & Francis, 1993, p.325-26. Brough was a popular member of a \\"bohemian\\" circle of journalists, writers and playwrights. In 1857, together with his brothers, Brough was a founding member of the Savage Club.Watson Aaron and Mark Twain. The Savage Club: A Medley of History, Anecdote, and Reminiscence, 1907, pp. 19–20, accessed 8 June 2012 He helped support the families of deceased writers and numerous working-class causes through benefit performances. He married actress Elizabeth Romer. They had three children including a daughter, Frances \\"Fanny\\" Whiteside Brough (1852–1914), an actress known for her portrayal of Kitty Warren in the 1905 staging of George Bernard Shaw's Mrs. Warren's Profession; and a son, Lionel Barnabas Brough (1857–1906), known professionally as Robert Brough, who became an actor-manager.Brough family details Robert Barnabas Brough was also related to Robert Brough Smyth. On 26 June 1860, Robert Brough died at 8 Boundary Street, Hulme, near Manchester, leaving his widow and three children with little money to support them. The Savage Club, with the help of five leading London theatres, arranged a benefit performance to establish a fund to support them, with Charles Dickens as a trustee.

It deals with the theme of brain-modified sex slaves as well as mental breakdowns in a hallucinogenic thrill ride. Plot 964 Pinocchio is a memory-wiped sex slave cyborg who is thrown out by his owners for failure to maintain an erection. It is unclear in what ways he has been modified beyond having no memory and being unable to communicate. He is discovered by Himiko, a homeless girl, while wandering aimlessly through the city. Himiko has also been memory-wiped, possibly by the same company that produced Pinocchio, but she is fully functional. Himiko spends her days drawing maps of the city, to aid other memory-wiped people. Himiko takes Pinocchio home and tries to teach him to speak. After much effort he has a breakthrough and finally becomes aware of his situation. At this point his body erupts in an inexplicable metamorphosis and it becomes clear that his modifications were much more involved and esoteric than simple memory loss. Himiko also begins to transform, though in a much more subtle manner. Release Unearthed Films released the film on DVD in the United States in 2007.

Because of quantum size effects and large surface area to volume ratio, nanomaterials have unique properties compared with their larger counterparts that affect their toxicity. Of the possible hazards, inhalation exposure appears to present the most concern, with animal studies showing pulmonary effects such as inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenicity for some nanomaterials. Skin contact and ingestion exposure are also a concern. Background Nanomaterials have at least one primary dimension of less than 100 nanometers, and often have properties different from those of their bulk components that are technologically useful. Because nanotechnology is a recent development, the health and safety effects of exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable, is not yet fully understood. Nanoparticles can be divided into combustion-derived nanoparticles (like diesel soot), manufactured nanoparticles like carbon nanotubes and naturally occurring nanoparticles from volcanic eruptions, atmospheric chemistry etc. Typical nanoparticles that have been studied are titanium dioxide, alumina, zinc oxide, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, and buckminsterfullerene. Nanotoxicology is a sub-specialty of particle toxicology. Nanomaterials appear to have toxicity effects that are unusual and not seen with larger particles. For example, even inert elements like gold become highly active at nanometer dimensions. Nanotoxicological studies are intended to determine whether and to what extent these properties may pose a threat to the environment and to human beings. Nanoparticles have much larger surface area to unit mass ratios which in some cases may lead to greater pro-inflammatory effects in, for example, lung tissue. In addition, some nanoparticles seem to be able to translocate from their site of deposition to distant sites such as the blood and the brain. Nanoparticles can be inhaled, swallowed, absorbed through skin and deliberately or accidentally injected during medical procedures. They might be accidentally or inadvertently released from materials implanted into living tissue. One study considers release of airborne engineered nanoparticles at workplaces, and associated worker exposure from various production and handling activities, to be very probable. Properties that affect toxicity Size is a key factor in determining the potential toxicity of a particle. However it is not the only important factor. Other properties of nanomaterials that influence toxicity include: chemical composition, shape, surface structure, surface charge, aggregation and solubility, and the presence or absence of functional groups of other chemicals. The large number of variables influencing toxicity means that it is difficult to generalise about health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials – each new nanomaterial must be assessed individually and all material properties must be taken into account. = Composition =  Metal-based  Metal based nanoparticles (NPs) are a prominent class of NPs synthesized for their functions as semiconductors, electroluminescents, and thermoelectric materials. Biomedically, these antibacterial NPs have been utilized in drug delivery systems to access areas previously inaccessible to conventional medicine. With the recent increase in interest and development of nanotechnology, many studies have been performed to assess whether the unique characteristics of these NPs, namely their large surface area to volume ratio, might negatively impact the environment upon which they were introduced. Researchers have found that some metal and metal oxide NPs may affect cells inducing DNA breakage and oxidation, mutations, reduced cell viability, warped morphology, induced apoptosis and necrosis, and decreased proliferation. Moreover, metal nanoparticles may persist in the organisms after administration if not carefully engineered.  Carbon-based  The latest toxicology studies on mice as of 2013 involving exposure to carbon nanotubes (CNT) showed a limited pulmonary inflammatory potential of MWCNT at levels corresponding to the average inhalable elemental carbon concentrations observed in U.S.-based CNT facilities. The study estimated that considerable years of exposure are necessary for significant pathology to occur. One review concludes that the evidence gathered since the discovery of fullerenes overwhelmingly points to C60 being non-toxic. As is the case for toxicity profile with any chemical modification of a structural moiety, the authors suggest that individual molecules be assessed individually.  Other  Other classes of nanomaterials include polymers such as nanocellulose, and dendrimers. = Size = There are many ways that size can affect the toxicity of a nanoparticle. For example, particles of different sizes can deposit in different places in the lungs, and are cleared from the lungs at different rates. Size can also affect the particles' reactivity and the specific mechanism by which they are toxic. =Dispersion state= Nanomaterials present in aerosol particles are often in an agglomerated or aggregated state, which affects their toxicological properties. The examples shown here are silver nanoparticles, nickel nanoparticles, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Many nanoparticles agglomerate or aggregate when they are placed in environmental or biological fluids. The terms agglomeration and aggregation have distinct definitions according to the standards organizations ISO and ASTM, where agglomeration signifies more loosely bound particles and aggregation signifies very tightly bound or fused particles (typically occurring during synthesis or drying). Nanoparticles frequently agglomerate due to the high ionic strength of environmental and biological fluids, which shields the repulsion due to charges on the nanoparticles. Unfortunately, agglomeration has frequently been ignored in nanotoxicity studies, even though agglomeration would be expected to affect nanotoxicity since it changes the size, surface area, and sedimentation properties of the nanoparticles. In addition, many nanoparticles will agglomerate to some extent in the environment or in the body before they reach their target, so it is desirable to study how toxicity is affected by agglomeration. The agglomeration/deagglomeration (mechanical stability) potentials of airborne engineered nanoparticle clusters also have significant influences on their size distribution profiles at the end-point of their environmental transport routes. Different aerosolization and deagglomeration systems have been established to test stability of nanoparticle agglomerates. = Surface chemistry and charge = NPs, in their implementation, are covered with coatings and sometimes given positive or negative charges depending upon the intended function. Studies have found that these external factors affect the degree of toxicity of NPs.  Routes of administration  = Respiratory = A scanning electron microscope image of bundles of multiwalled carbon nanotube piercing an alveolar epithelial cell. Inhalation exposure is the most common route of exposure to airborne particles in the workplace. The deposition of nanoparticles in the respiratory tract is determined by the shape and size of particles or their agglomerates, and they are deposited in the lungs to a greater extent than larger respirable particles. Based on animal studies, nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream from the lungs and translocate to other organs, including the brain. The inhalation risk is affected by the dustiness of the material, the tendency of particles to become airborne in response to a stimulus. Dust generation is affected by the particle shape, size, bulk density, and inherent electrostatic forces, and whether the nanomaterial is a dry powder or incorporated into a slurry or liquid suspension. Animal studies indicate that carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers can cause pulmonary effects including inflammation, granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis, which were of similar or greater potency when compared with other known fibrogenic materials such as silica, asbestos, and ultrafine carbon black. Some studies in cells or animals have shown genotoxic or carcinogenic effects, or systemic cardiovascular effects from pulmonary exposure. Although the extent to which animal data may predict clinically significant lung effects in workers is not known, the toxicity seen in the short-term animal studies indicate a need for protective action for workers exposed to these nanomaterials. As of 2013, further research was needed in long-term animal studies and epidemiologic studies in workers. No reports of actual adverse health effects in workers using or producing these nanomaterials were known as of 2013. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) dust is considered a lung tumor risk, with ultrafine (nanoscale) particles having an increased mass-based potency relative to fine TiO2, through a secondary genotoxicity mechanism that is not specific to TiO2 but primarily related to particle size and surface area. = Dermal = Some studies suggest that nanomaterials could potentially enter the body through intact skin during occupational exposure. Studies have shown that particles smaller than 1 μm in diameter may penetrate into mechanically flexed skin samples, and that nanoparticles with varying physicochemical properties were able to penetrate the intact skin of pigs. Factors such as size, shape, water solubility, and surface coating directly affect a nanoparticle's potential to penetrate the skin. At this time, it is not fully known whether skin penetration of nanoparticles would result in adverse effects in animal models, although topical application of raw SWCNT to nude mice has been shown to cause dermal irritation, and in vitro studies using primary or cultured human skin cells have shown that carbon nanotubes can enter cells and cause release of pro- inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and decreased viability. It remains unclear, however, how these findings may be extrapolated to a potential occupational risk. In addition, nanoparticles may enter the body through wounds, with particles migrating into the blood and lymph nodes. = Gastrointestinal = Ingestion can occur from unintentional hand-to-mouth transfer of materials; this has been found to happen with traditional materials, and it is scientifically reasonable to assume that it also could happen during handling of nanomaterials. Ingestion may also accompany inhalation exposure because particles that are cleared from the respiratory tract via the mucociliary escalator may be swallowed. Biodistribution Pathways of exposure to nanoparticles and associated diseases as suggested by epidemiological, in vivo and in vitro studies. The extremely small size of nanomaterials also means that they much more readily gain entry into the human body than larger sized particles. How these nanoparticles behave inside the body is still a major question that needs to be resolved. The behavior of nanoparticles is a function of their size, shape and surface reactivity with the surrounding tissue. In principle, a large number of particles could overload the body's phagocytes, cells that ingest and destroy foreign matter, thereby triggering stress reactions that lead to inflammation and weaken the body's defense against other pathogens. In addition to questions about what happens if non-degradable or slowly degradable nanoparticles accumulate in bodily organs, another concern is their potential interaction or interference with biological processes inside the body. Because of their large surface area, nanoparticles will, on exposure to tissue and fluids, immediately adsorb onto their surface some of the macromolecules they encounter. This may, for instance, affect the regulatory mechanisms of enzymes and other proteins. Nanomaterials are able to cross biological membranes and access cells, tissues and organs that larger-sized particles normally cannot. Nanomaterials can gain access to the blood stream via inhalation or ingestion. Broken skin is an ineffective particle barrier, suggesting that acne, eczema, shaving wounds or severe sunburn may accelerate skin uptake of nanomaterials. Then, once in the blood stream, nanomaterials can be transported around the body and be taken up by organs and tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow and nervous system. Nanomaterials can be toxic to human tissue and cell cultures (resulting in increased oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine production and cell death) depending on their composition and concentration.  Mechanisms of toxicity  =Oxidative stress= For some types of particles, the smaller they are, the greater their surface area to volume ratio and the higher their chemical reactivity and biological activity. The greater chemical reactivity of nanomaterials can result in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including free radicals. ROS production has been found in a diverse range of nanomaterials including carbon fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and nanoparticle metal oxides. ROS and free radical production is one of the primary mechanisms of nanoparticle toxicity; it may result in oxidative stress, inflammation, and consequent damage to proteins, membranes and DNA. = Cytotoxicity = A primary marker for the damaging effects of NPs has been cell viability as determined by state and exposed surface area of the cell membrane. Cells exposed to metallic NPs have, in the case of copper oxide, had up to 60% of their cells rendered unviable. When diluted, the positively charged metal ions often experience an electrostatic attraction to the cell membrane of nearby cells, covering the membrane and preventing it from permeating the necessary fuels and wastes. With less exposed membrane for transportation and communication, the cells are often rendered inactive. NPs have been found to induce apoptosis in certain cells primarily due to the mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress brought on by the foreign NPs electrostatic reactions. = Genotoxicity = Metal and metal oxide NPs such as silver, zinc, copper oxide, uraninite, and cobalt oxide have also been found to cause DNA damage. The damage done to the DNA will often result in mutated cells and colonies as found with the HPRT gene test. Methods and standards Characterization of a nanomaterial's physical and chemical properties is important for ensuring the reproducibility of toxicology studies, and is also vital for studying how the properties of nanomaterials determine their biological effects. The properties of a nanomaterial such as size distribution and agglomeration state can change as a material is prepared and used in toxicology studies, making it important to measure them at different points in the experiment. With comparison to more conventional toxicology studies, in nanotoxicology, characterisation of the potential contaminants is challenging. The biological systems are themselves still not completely known at this scale. Visualisation methods such as electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis allow visualisation of the nano world. Further nanotoxicology studies will require precise characterisation of the specificities of a given nano-element: size, chemical composition, detailed shape, level of aggregation, combination with other vectors, etc. Above all, these properties would have to be determined not only on the nanocomponent before its introduction in the living environment but also in the (mostly aqueous) biological environment. There is a need for new methodologies to quickly assess the presence and reactivity of nanoparticles in commercial, environmental, and biological samples since current detection techniques require expensive and complex analytical instrumentation.  Policy and regulatory aspects  Toxicology studies of nanomaterials are a key input into determining occupational exposure limits. The Royal Society identifies the potential for nanoparticles to penetrate the skin, and recommends that the use of nanoparticles in cosmetics be conditional upon a favorable assessment by the relevant European Commission safety advisory committee. The Woodrow Wilson Centre's Project on Emerging Technologies conclude that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. While the US National Nanotechnology Initiative reports that around four percent (about $40 million) is dedicated to risk related research and development, the Woodrow Wilson Centre estimate that only around $11 million is actually directed towards risk related research. They argued in 2007 that it would be necessary to increase funding to a minimum of $50 million in the following two years so as to fill the gaps in knowledge in these areas. The potential for workplace exposure was highlighted by the 2004 Royal Society report which recommended a review of existing regulations to assess and control workplace exposure to nanoparticles and nanotubes. The report expressed particular concern for the inhalation of large quantities of nanoparticles by workers involved in the manufacturing process. Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (‘mad cow's disease'), thalidomide, genetically modified food, nuclear energy, reproductive technologies, biotechnology, and asbestosis. In light of such concerns, the Canadian-based ETC Group have called for a moratorium on nano-related research until comprehensive regulatory frameworks are developed that will ensure workplace safety.

It replaced the previous JumpStart 2nd Grade released in 1996. As its name suggests, it was made to teach second grade students. From 2003–2008, it was distributed as the \\"Fundamentals\\" disc in a 3- or 4-disc package of the same name, though recently a factory error in some packages caused the Fundamentals disc to be replaced by JumpStart 3D Virtual World: The Quest for the Color Meister going by the same name. Like the original version, this game prominently features the frog C.J. and his sidekick Edison the firefly, but also includes characters from other JumpStart games, such as Hopsalot the rabbit, who originally appeared in JumpStart Kindergarten, as well as Frankie the dog who first appeared in JumpStart 1st Grade. Additionally, the plot is more complex than the original and involves an anthropomorphic snail called Dr. O doing evil deeds, such as vandalizing \\"Mount Jumpmore\\" (parody of Mount Rushmore) by painting moustaches on all the faces. The JumpStart characters (in the form of the \\"JumpStart Intelligence Agency\\", or J.I.A.) must fix up the damage Dr. O causes. Hopsalot makes plans for a machine he calls the \\"Soapy Shooter\\" which will clean up the graffiti. However, he lacks the parts he requires to build it. Thus, C.J., Edison, and the player of the game travel to different continents, playing games to earn \\"gadget pieces\\". After the player plays another game in order to make the machine work, Dr. O causes another problem, requiring the user to go on another quest for gadget pieces to make Hopsalot's machines work; there are six different missions total, including inflating the island on which C.J.'s house rests (as Dr. O deflated it), ridding a schoolhouse of worms which infest it thanks to Dr. O, and thawing out a river after Dr. O turns the water into ice cubes. Character details All of the characters below are anthropomorphic animals. Also, most of the characters are not wearing their \\"normal\\" outfit in JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade; that is, the outfits they wear in this game are not the same ones they wore in other games released around the same time. Frankie: (Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) As stated above, Frankie is a dachshund dog who first appeared in JumpStart 1st Grade. In this product, he is the head of the JumpStart Intelligence Agency and is prominent on the box art, but despite these points, he does not play as big a part as other characters, such as C.J. Frog, and seems to be more of a mascot than a main character. In this game, he is a semi-light brown in color and wears a white tuxedo suit (though his outfit on the box art is much different). In most other games released around the time, such as other JumpStart Advanced titles, he wore a red sweater with yellow lining and a blue dog collar. Though the box art seems to suggest Frankie going on daredevil missions, he never does so in the game; he simply stays at headquarters while C.J. does the adventuring. Frankie's taking on of leadership roles is common in recent games. Hopsalot: (Voiced by Brianne Siddall) Referred to as \\"Mr. Hopsalot\\" in some other products and nicknamed \\"Hops\\", Hopsalot is a rabbit who first appeared in JumpStart Kindergarten. In this game, as in other games in the JumpStart Advanced series, he seems to be naturally bright and is talented at creating new inventions. In this product, he appears to be the scientist for the J.I.A., is light brown in color, and wears goggles with a white suit. His \\"normal outfit\\" at the time of the original JumpStart Advanced was simply a teal T-shirt. C.J.: (Voiced by Joshua Seth) A frog and one of the main characters, C.J. first appeared in the original JumpStart 2nd Grade game. As in his original appearance, he is adventurous. His looks are different from his original looks, however; he is more thinner and taller, making him look somewhat more like a human, is bright green, and wears sunglasses, a light coat, and, like his original incarnation, a hat. His normal outfit at the time contained a tan shirt, pants, a brown vest, and lacked sunglasses (though the hat is the same). He is occasionally referred to as \\"Pond\\" by Frankie and Dr. O, a possible James Bond reference. Edison: (Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) C.J.'s firefly sidekick who also debuts in the original 2nd Grade. In this game, he seems to dislike adventuring (once expressing that he wishes the gadget pieces were hidden in \\"quiet places\\" like golf courses and petting zoos) and, as in most games made after 2nd Grade where he appears, sports an Irish-sounding accent. His looks are very different from his original appearance: he is blue-green in color with a different hat and outfit. He's possibly named after Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb. Lucy: (Voiced by Kath Soucie) A female frog resembling C.J. in some ways, but with a darker color and red lipstick. She appears in the different continents that C.J. and Edison visits as an \\"agent in the field\\", though she always says her name is some sort of variant of Lucy; for example, she calls herself \\"Dr. Lucicle\\" in Antarctica and \\"Lucianova\\" in Russia (Europe). She wears sunglasses like C.J. and her eyes are never seen (C.J.'s eyes are, however, shown in the beginning cutscene). Dr. O: A snail and the game's main villain, Dr. O is a snail with yellow- orange body, a large brown shell, a spectacle, and a brown shirt with a red tie. He does various evil-doings, especially vandalism, which must be fixed using machines Hopsalot creates. Not surprisingly, he dislikes CJ, and to some extent, they seem to have a rivalry. He bears an uncanny resemblance to the character Dr. Listick, a villain who appeared in the older JumpStart Reading for Second Graders http://sonic.net/mnitepub/pccafe/reviews/jsreading2ndgrader/jsreading2ndgrade.html and the book CJ and the Mysterious Map.https://www.amazon.com/Mysterious-Map- JumpStart-Grade-Readers/dp/0439164486 Despite appearing in other JumpStart Advanced games, Casey Cat, Pierre Polar Bear, Eleanor Elephant, and Kisha Koala are absent from JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade, not including the All-Star feature and the cameo made by Kisha, Eleanor and Casey as faces on Mount Jumpmore (parody of Mount Rushmore). A few of the comments made by these characters in the All-Star feature (and the fact that they all are wearing shades) seems to indicate that they are intelligence agents themselves, even though they do not appear in the main game. Gameplay The main menu of the game is the J.I.A. headquarters. A small world map is displayed and there are several red dots on the map to click on. Once a dot is clicked, C.J. and Edison will drive to the location it represents. Once they are at the location, Lucy will introduce herself (with a different name each time). The player can then click on different clickable things to hear facts about them. In order to earn the gadget piece, though, an educational game must be played by clicking a particular thing. Usually, the games are doing some sort of favor for Lucy. Once a game is completed, Lucy will give the user a gadget piece, and it will be added to the inventory. Once a minimum of 4 gadget pieces are obtained, the user must head back to H.Q. to play another game in Hopsalot's laboratory in order to activate Hopsalot's machine. After this, the user clicks around at certain areas to complete some sort of task. Afterwards, news will be reported that Dr. O has done another crime, Hopsalot will explain his invention that will fix it, and the process repeats. Once all the missions are done, the game essentially starts over from the beginning and the missions are re-done in order. Games The games are referred to by the place they are played in. As is the case of several JumpStart games, there are three levels of difficulty to determine how challenging the problems are, and a separate gameplay level that determines the difficulty of the games themselves. Also note that many games must be played a certain number of rounds in order to be fully completed and for the player to receive a gadget piece. =Africa= C.J. and Edison must \\"uncover the secret of the cave drawings\\" via the user playing a game that teaches reading comprehension. The user must read a short story. Some pictures must be placed on a background to explain what the story says. For example, if the story says that a bird is in a tree, the user must place a picture of a bird onto the tree in the background. Sometimes, players may have to place blocks of text onto a blank background rather than images on illustrated backgrounds. =Antarctica= \\"Dr. Lucicle\\" (Lucy) must cure sick penguins. However, they are on the other side of a body of water. In order to make a bridge for the penguins to cross, the player must put ice flows with pictures or text on them in a particular order. For example, you sometimes put words in alphabetical order, Roman numerals in counting order, or pictures of an animal or plant's life cycle in the order they happen. =Australia= In order to obtain some mail for Lucy (as a mail carrier) to deliver, C.J. must drive a car to the mail bag, collecting gas cans to make sure the car does not run out of fuel. The arrow keys are used to maneuver the car and the space bar is used to shoot a type of laser that can be used to destroy obstacles. The gas cans will have text next to them. C.J. will say what kind of text must be next to the gas can in order for the gas to be beneficial for the fuel tank. For example, C.J. will sometimes ask that gas with odd numbers be collected or gas with even numbers be collected, meaning that this game sometimes teaches mathematics. He will sometimes also ask things related to language arts/reading, such as asking the player to collect gas with words that have a blend in them or words with a digraph in them. If a fuel can is shot, C.J. will read the text near it out loud. =France, Europe= This country actually has two games. One is a painting game that gives you no gadget piece upon completion. The other game features an art gallery that is missing some artwork. In each round, there is a room with three pieces of artwork in it and an empty frame. C.J. will explain that the room has a certain type of artwork in it. (For example, artwork with a monochromatic, polychromatic, or black-and-white color scheme, portraits, landscapes, etc.) The task is to find a picture of the same type in the basement of the museum (which must be accessed by clicking an arrow). In the basement, C.J. will hold a broom and must be guided around using the arrow keys. The whole basement is dirty, but whenever C.J. moves around, the space he is on is cleaned off. The space bar is used to look at the picture inside a crate. If the crate has the right type of art inside, C.J. must push it out through the door. There must be a clean, dirt-free path to the door, however. Additionally, C.J. has three brooms (lives) to begin with. If C.J. touches an enemy dirt devil, he will lose a broom and go back to his starting position. Also, if a dust devil touches a space C.J. has cleaned off, it will become dirty again. The process repeats until the final round in which the player goes to the painting game to fill in the final space. =New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, North America= In this game (which teaches music), there is a missing section in a piece of music. You must choose the correct note(s) to put into the missing space. There is an additional mode in which you can create your own music. =Russia, Europe= (Note: This game does not mention how Russia is also partially in Asia, so it's presumable that you are visiting the European side of Russia while playing this game.) This game resembles some form of board game featuring red and black checkers-styled spaces and snowman game pieces. The game pieces hold signs of different colors, each with a word on it. The goal is to get one of your (C.J.'s) pieces to the other side of the board before Lucianova (Lucy/the computer) gets hers to the other side of the board. You can block Lucy's pieces if they are holding the same color sign as the piece you are blocking with. There's also a plank at the bottom of the screen stating an additional way to block your opponent's pieces, i.e. block your opponents pieces with antonyms (referring to the word on the sign). =South America= A Frogger-like game where the player makes C.J. walk and hop on logs, turtles, and alligators by using the arrow keys. A question will be displayed at the bottom of the screen which Edison will read out loud. C.J. must reach the island containing the correct answer to the question. This game can teach a variety of subjects, including coins of the United States, mathematics, and language arts. If C.J. is guided to jump into the water, C.J. will swim back to shore, despite the fact that it would be quicker to swim to a floating object. =Hopsalot's Laboratory= This game does not earn the user gadget pieces; instead, it is something that must be accomplished after at least 4 gadget pieces are obtained. This game can be accessed two ways. One is to click the star above the world map at the headquarters which will only appear if the user has at least 4 gadget pieces. The other way is by clicking on a bookshelf (also at the headquarters). If you choose the star, you will use the gadget pieces you have earned from the games and the invention featured will be the one that Hopsalot is using to fix Dr. O's misdoings. Once Hopsalot's Laboratory is completed when accessed by the star, progress will be made in the game. However, if the bookshelf is clicked, gadget pieces will not be the ones the user has obtained, progress will not be made in the game, and the invention featured will not be one that is used to fix Dr. O's wrongs. In other words, the \\"bookshelf mode\\" can be viewed as a kind of practice mode to improve skills used in the \\"star mode\\", to have fun, and/or for educational value. Usually in the game, there will be a ball at one side of the screen and Hopsalot's invention on the other. The player must arrange different gadget pieces in different places to get the ball to touch the invention. The ball will bounce off some gadget pieces, will be propelled by some gadget pieces, and will have other reactions from other pieces. Sometimes, things are a bit different (i.e. sometimes a block is involved). This game is supposed to teach logic.

It was directed by John Guillermin. The screenplay was adapted by Bryan Forbes from the autobiography of M. E. Clifton James, an actor who pretended to be General Montgomery as a decoy during the Second World War. Plot A few months before the D-Day landings during the Second World War, the British government decides to launch a campaign of disinformation; spreading a rumour that the landings just might take place at a location other than Normandy. The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan (Cecil Parker) and Major Harvey (John Mills). They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating \\"Monty\\". 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees. Disguised as a corporal, he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa. Accompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to brigadier for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, \\"Jimmy\\" arrives at Gibraltar, where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness. To further foster the deception, a local businessman and known German agent, Karl Nielson (Marius Goring), is invited to dinner, knowing that he will spread the information. This happens quickly and their aeroplane is (unsuccessfully) attacked on leaving Gibraltar. James and Harvey tour several places in North Africa and visit the troops. With only a few days to go before the landings, it is learned that the Germans have indeed been fooled and have kept large numbers of troops in the south, away from Normandy. His job done, James is put into \\"cold storage\\" at a heavily guarded villa on the coast. But the Germans have been fooled more than Harvey realises. A team of German commandos are landed by submarine to kidnap 'Monty'. They kill his guards and are ready to embark with James, but Harvey gets wind of the kidnap and foils it at the last moment. They return quietly to London. Cast *M. E. Clifton James as himself and General Montgomery *John Mills as Major Harvey *Cecil Parker as Colonel E. F.

The German High Command did plan to have him killed, but Hitler vetoed the plan until he could be sure where the landings would actually take place. Gibraltar was in reality a hotbed of German agents, and James/Montgomery was spied on by several operatives who were smuggled into Gibraltar specifically to discover what \\"Monty\\" was up to. James/Montgomery deliberately talked nonsense about non- existent operations and plans, in the hope that the spies would overhear and take such information seriously. The intelligence officer who initially recruited James was David Niven, at that time serving as a lieutenant-colonel at the War Office. Production When James agreed to impersonate Montgomery, he was never to mention it under army regulations. However, after Operation Copperhead was mentioned in the book My Three Years with Eisenhower, James asked for permission to write a book, which was granted.THE MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MONTY Buchwald, Art.

Tony Owen later said the last movie he made \\"died a death at the box office\\". This may have been I Was Monty's Double. Variety called it \\"excellently acted and directed....he film has several moments of real tension. Even with a somewhat fictionalized ending, there is a documentary flavor about it which is absorbing. Plenty of-news footage has been woven into the pic and it has been done with commendable ingenuity. Bryan Forbes’ taut screenplay is liberally spiced with humor...James shows himself to be a resourceful actor in his own right...Though many filmgoers must think that it is time to cease fire when it comes to war films, “I Was Monty’s 1 Double” is a refreshingly different pic.

Water resources and uses in the basin Fishing boats on the Davao River River discharge measurements taken from 1984 to 1990 indicated an average river flow of approximately 78 cubic meters per second for the period. The main drinking water sources for Davao City are in the neighboring Talomo watershed. These sources are under pressure and the Davao River Basin is likely to be required for water abstraction in the near future. The Environmental Management Bureau samples 8 sites from the confluence of the Tamugan river downstream to the mouth of the river. From the Tamugan River confluence with the Davao River down stream to DDF Subdivision, Mandug the water is classified as Class A – Public Water Supply Class II. Downstream of this point to the sea is classified as Class B or recreational water class I. Analyses for dissolved oxygen over the past 4 years has indicated no significant change in quality.

Life He kept terms at Exeter College, Oxford, but as a Roman Catholic could not matriculate. He sat for St Ives from 1620 to 1622. Staying away to recover his family fortune for most of the 1630s, he returned and presented himself to court and the king in 1639. The fifth Marquess and the Queen became firm friends thereafter, and therefore his chief seat, Basing House, was the great resort of Queen Henrietta Maria's friends in south-west England. On the outbreak of the English Civil War he fortified and garrisoned Basing House and held it for Charles I during 1643 and 1644. The siege of Basing House, notwithstanding an attempt of his youngest brother, Lord Edward Paulet, to deliver it up to the enemy, lasted from August 1643 to 16 October 1645, when, during the general decline of the Royal cause, it was taken by storm, after a determined defence, by Oliver Cromwell. The brutality with which the house was sacked was most unusual, as atrocities against civilians during the Civil War were rare and generally discouraged by both sides: the explanation may be the presence of a number of Catholic priests among the defenders. Paulet was subsequently renowned as a great loyalist. The Marquess was made prisoner with such of his garrison as survived the fight; ten pieces of ordnance and much ammunition were also taken by the victors, as Oliver Cromwell himself, who directed the assault, wrote to the Speaker. He was committed to the Tower of London on a charge of high treason in 1645, where he remained a long time; an order was made for allowing him 5l. a week out of his property on 15 Jan 1646. Lady Winchester, who had escaped from Basing two days before its fall, was sent to join her husband in the Tower on 31 Jan, and a weekly sum of 10l., afterwards increased to 15l., was ordered to be paid her for the support of herself and her children, with the stipulation that the latter were to be educated as Protestants. An ordinance for the sale of Winchester's land was passed on 30 Oct, and by the act of 16 July 1651 a portion was sold by the trustees for the sale of forfeited estates. On 7 Sep 1647 Winchester was allowed to drink the waters at Epsom, and stayed there by permission of parliament for nearly six months. The House of Lords on 30 June 1648 urged the commons to release him on bail in consideration of his bad health. In the propositions sent to the king at the Isle of Wight on 13 Oct it was expressly stipulated that Winchester's name be excepted from pardon. Ultimately the commons resolved on 14 March 1649 not to proceed against him for high treason, but they ordered him to be detained in prison and excepted from any composition for his estate. In January 1656 he was a prisoner in execution in the upper bench for debts amounting to 2,000l., and he petitioned Cromwell for relief. The sale of his lands was discontinued by order of parliament on 15 March 1660, and after the Restoration Winchester received them back. It was proposed on 3 Aug 1660 to recompense him for his losses to the amount of 19,000l. and damages, subsequently reduced to 10,000l., and this was agreed to on 2 July 1661. In the event he was allowed to go unrecompensed at the Restoration of the Monarchy, but regained his lands.

Death He retired to Englefield House in Berkshire, which was a wedding gift from his second marriage to Lady Honora de Burgh in the early 1630s. He died on 5 March 1674 and was buried at Englefield, Berkshire. Paulet was succeeded, by his eldest son, Charles Paulet, as 6th Marquess of Winchester, later created 1st Duke of Bolton. Charles converted to the Church of England, a great blow to the Roman Catholic community of Hampshire, who had for many years looked to the Paulet family to shield them from the worst rigours of the Penal Laws.

FSSCA supports grassroots development emphasizing environmental sustainability, economic self-sufficiency, social justice, and peace. History FSSCA was founded in 1996 with the intent of assisting the recovery of the people of Central America from the aftermath of the brutal Salvadoran Civil War (1980–1992). FSSCA's original executive director, José Inocencio Alas, has been honored by the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding with its Peace Activist Award \\"in recognition of his dedication to human rights, and notably for his efforts to preserve peace in El Salvador during the violent aftermath of its civil war.\\" Alas is profiled in the Tannebaum Center's recent publication, Peacemakers in Action: Profiles of Religion in Conflict Resolution, scheduled for release by Cambridge University Press in March 2007. Since 1998, FSSCA has worked in partnership with the communities comprising the \\"Coordinadora del Bajo Lempa\\" near the Pacific Coast of El Salvador. The Coordinadora was originally formed from the mix of settlers relocated under the land reform provisions of the 1993 peace accords onto former plantation land in the Lempa River delta region. Primarily farmers and fishers, settlers organized in the mid-1990s to eliminate disastrous flooding, aggravated when floodgates upstream were opened without warning to the settlers along the river delta below. Their leadership evolved on a democratic model to attain sustainable development beyond flood control. In 1998, the Coordinadora's communities committed themselves to ending the violence endemic to the region since the end of El Salvador's civil war. They declared their communities to comprise a Local Zone of Peace and resolved to change the region's culture of violence to one of reconciliation, collaborative problem solving and non-violent conflict resolution. Mission FSSCA support to the Coordinadora's includes funding their administrative budget; a micro-lending credit program, supporting the development of their Culture of Peace and Conflict Management programs; home construction; the construction of the Coordinadora's field office and two disaster relief shelters. A strong component of the relationship is respect for the Coordinadora's internal decision making as to the allocation of funds, rather than externally determined earmarks. FSSCA builds relationships between the Coordinadora and international organizations such as USAID, the US Embassy, the American Jewish World Service, the Overbrook Foundation, the Shefa Fund, the Communitas Charitable Trust. It organized the March 2000 Judeo-Christian Ecumenical Peace Conference in San Salvador, building bridges between the Jewish community and Salvadoran peasants. . FSSCA also assists in writing and presenting project proposals to U.S.-based foundations and individuals, organizes delegations to visit El Salvador, and recruits volunteers to provide technical assistance to projects.

Career Martin was a professional musician by the age of sixteen when he played drums for the big bands of Count Basie, Jimmy Dorsey, Les and Larry Elgart, Duke Ellington, Maynard Ferguson, Quincy Jones, and Billy May. In the 1960s he worked with Gary Burton, Donald Byrd, Curtis Fuller, Herbie Hancock, Oliver Nelson, Sonny Rollins, Steve Swallow, and Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross. He was a member of a band in West Germany that consisted of Lee Konitz, Albert Mangelsdorff, and Attila Zoller and in a band with Rolf Kuhn and Joachim Kuhn. Stu was a member of The Trio with Barre Phillips and John Surman, then as a member with Charlie Mariano. In the 1970s he recorded with Carla Bley, Slide Hampton, and John McLaughlin. Later in his career, he was one of the principal teachers at the Creative Music Studio in Woodstock, NY. His unorthodox style of teaching made for wild scenes at times. If you didn't know what to do, he was merciless. If you were talented and sincere, he became your friend. A small man, he had an outsize personality and a sense of style that was flawless. Jack DeJohnette was a close friend. He asked Stu to tune his drums,as Stu had an unmatched sensitivity for tuning. His own kit consisted of a pair of bass drums tuned 1/2 step apart,floor toms pitched the same way, rack toms likewise, snare, and hi-hat. Other than the hi-hat, all of the cymbals were the China type placed upside down. His sound was utterly unique. Stu had gone to Europe with Gary Burton's group, and decided not to come back to the US after the tour. Later he did, but he was more at home in Europe. He and his long term girlfriend Lee Norman, the American actor, had a son, Ezekiel Zachariah Martin, in 1972. EZ, as he was called, went on to become a fine drummer himself.

A cat registry stores the pedigrees (genealogies) of cats, cattery names, and other details of cats; studbooks (lists of authorised studs of recognised breeds), breed descriptions, and the formal breed standards (a.k.a. standards of points or SoP); lists of judges qualified to judge at shows run by or affiliated with that registry; and sometimes other information. A cat registry is not the same as a breed club or breed society (these are specific-breed organisations that may be affiliated with one or more registries with whom they have lodged breed standards in order to be able to exhibit under the auspices of that registry). Cat registries each have their own rules and usually also organise or license (sanction) cat shows. The show procedures vary widely, and awards won in one registry are not normally recognised by another. Some registries only serve breeders, while others are oriented toward pet owners and provide individual as well as cattery memberships, while yet others are federations only deal with breed clubs or even other registries as intermediaries between the organisation and breeders. History The first cat registry was the National Cat Club, set up in 1887 in England. Until the formation of the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in 1910, the National Cat Club was also the governing body of the cat fancy. A rival registry called the Cat Club was set up in 1898,The Cat Club (1899-1902). \\"The Cat Club Register.\\" but foundered in 1903 and was replaced by the [British] Cat Fanciers' Association. Cats could only be registered with one or the other registry. These two fancies merged in 1910 and became the GCCF. In the United States, the 1899 Chicago cat show resulted in the formation of the Chicago Cat Club, followed by the better-organized Beresford Cat Club (named after noted British breeder Lady Marcus Beresford). In 1906, the Beresford Cat Club renamed itself the American Cat Association (ACA) and rapidly became the dominant North American registry for a short time. In 1908, the [American, and extant] Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) split off, and both organisations continue to the present, with competition from The International Cat Association (TICA), also US-based, as well as more regional associations. ACA today accepts Canadian and Mexican as well as US registrations, but remains primarily active in the northeastern United States. Both TICA and CFA are international, though the bulk of their pedigrees are issued to US breeders. In the intervening years, many cat registries have been formed worldwide. These range from international organisations or federations to national registries in one particular country. In many countries, independent registries have also been formed which may or may not be recognised by the main registries. The internationally broadest organisation is the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe, founded 1949 in Paris, and presently based in Belgium), which is a worldwide federation of member cat registries, with a large European and South American presence. The World Cat Federation (WCF, founded 1988 in Rio de Janeiro, presently based in Germany), has a strong presence in Latin America, throughout Western Europe, and in countries of the former USSR). It is organized on a similar basis to FIFe, but has much more permissive approach to new breed acceptance. Like CFA, WCF provides a cattery registration service (to \\"reserve\\" cattery names and prevent others from using conflicting ones). While some cat registries forbid the practice, it is now common to allow a cat to be registered by more than one registry. The World Cat Congress (WCC) is an international coordinating organisation of the largest cat registries. WCC operates an \\"open-door\\" policy by which cats registered with one WCC registry can be shown under the rules of another WCC registry. Going further, the World Cat Federation, a WCC member accepts half again as many breeds as it publishes standards for, because it accepting the standards of TICA, FIFe, and several other WCC-affiliated federations, though it has also produced some nomenclatural conflicts with some of them. Some independent cat registries specialise in particular types of cat that are ineligible for registration with a major registry due to breed restrictions or certain genetic traits. For example, The Dwarf Cat Association recognises breeds derived from the short-legged Munchkin (a cat body type genetic mutation) which are banned by FIFe and some other registries. The Rare and Exotic Feline Registry specialises in cats derived from (or alleged to derive from) hybridisation with wildcat species. Recognition levels Most registries offer several levels of recognition (often called registers). The actual designations differ between registries, but typically these are: ; Full : a breed that competes for championship titles at shows organised by, or affiliated to, that registry ; Provisional/Preliminary : the level of recognition of cat breeds until they demonstrate that they breed true to their registered standards; there may be several levels of provisional/preliminary recognition e.g. new or advanced as numbers and popularity increase ; Experimental : a provisional register for breeds in development; this may be separate from the provisional/preliminary register in some cat fancies ; Exhibition only : a new trait, new import or minority variety that does not compete, but is exhibited in order to attract opinion and/or potential breeders ; Registration only : status means cats of that breed can be registered, but do not have permission to be exhibited. Not all breeds achieve full (championship) status. In breeds known to carry recessive genes (e.g. long-haired cats born from short-haired parents, colourpoint cats born from non-colourpoint parents), cats that do not meet their breed standard might be registered as variants or they might be registered under a different breed name. These may sometimes be used to maintain a good gene pool, but not exhibited in championship classes for the parents' breed. A genetic register is used by some registries for breeds where a genetic test is required before cats can be bred. Cats that have not been cleared through testing remain on the genetic register unless negative test results are provided. There may also be active and inactive registers that denote whether a cat legitimately may be used in breeding and its offspring registered. A cat registry is at liberty to refuse to accept breeds if it feels the breed is not genetically sound; does not breed true to the standard put forward by the developer(s) of the breed (with allowances made for known variants); is not represented in sufficient numbers or is not sufficiently distinct from breeds already recognised by the registry. It may also expel breeders who do not conform to accepted standards of behaviour and ethics, with the result that their cats may be disqualified from its shows. The rules as to what constitutes a new breed vary from registry to registry. The International Cat Association (TICA) is a relatively progressive registry that will recognise breeds derived from crossing existing breeds; mutations of an existing breed; naturally occurring breeds indigenous to a geographical location; a breed already recognised by a different registry; and experimental breeds that do not yet have a TICA-approved breed name.TICA Registration Rules Relating to Breed Recognition and Types of Registration FIFe will register some new breeds imported from other registries but have set procedures for these breeds to gain full recognition. The GCCF is a more conservative registry and recognises new colour variations of an existing breed, but do not usually recognise other mutations of an existing breed e.g. spontaneous rexed fur, and are slow to accept new breeds. CFA takes a similar resistant approach, and has a position statement discouraging most attempts at new breed formation or even new coat colour patterns. What constitutes a breed at all also varies widely between registries. Some \\"permissive\\" organisations recognise as separate breeds what most \\"conservative\\" registries would consider several coat variants of the same breed. For example, the WCF treats all long-haired and short-haired variants as distinct breeds, and both WCF and CFA recognize a Colourpoint Shorthair breed that others consider a Siamese cat with non-standard colouration. Similarly, the Cymric is recognized as a breed in some registries, considered under that name as a sub-breed of the Manx in some, called simply the Manx Longhair or Longhair Manx in others, and not recognized at all by a few. Registries may also use different names for the same breed, and the WCF has even been known to assign breed names that conflict with those other registries (i.e. are applied to completely different breeds). Various registries includes breeds not recognized (yet) by any others, either due to differences in relative progressiveness toward breed introduction and establishment, or due to geographical proximity to breeds unknown in other parts of the world. Breed numbers, acronyms and codes Registries allocate a breed number, acronym or a Code to the breeds they register. Most use a two or 3 letter acronym e.g. MK (Munchkin), JBT (Japanese Bobtail). This may be followed by numbers or lower case acronyms that indicate colour and pattern, these being subdivisions of the breed. For historical reasons, the British GCCF allocate numbers to breeds and the Black Persian Longhair is registered under a different breed number, and effectively as a different breed, to the Blue Persian Longhair. These lists may be found on individual registry websites (or in their printed publications where they do not yet have a website). All FIFe Member cat registries use the EMS (Easy Memory System) breed and variety code which consists of a breed abbreviation followed by pattern and colour letters and digits which are consistent across all breeds. Where a breed is already recognised by another registry, it is becoming increasingly common to adopt an existing acronym (with the possible addition or subtraction of a letter) in order to avoid clashes and confusion. Where 2 breeds with different characteristics have the same name, it is usual to prefix the name with the country/area of origin e.g. in the US the \\"Burmese\\" and \\"European Burmese\\" are different breeds with different conformation. In the UK, \\"Burmese\\" refers to the European form as the \\"American Burmese\\" is not recognised. A single breed may have 2 different breed names in different countries. In Britain, a cat of Persian type with the colourpoint pattern is called a Colourpoint Persian. In the USA it is called a Himalayan. The American-bred Serengeti was founded in 1992 by Karen Sausaman from Oriental x Bengal crosses to resemble the wild cats of the Serengeti plains but without the introduction of wild cat blood. In Britain, a Bengal x Siamese cross was originally called the Savannah, but was later renamed Serengeti because of an existing American breed called the Savannah. The American-bred Savannah resembles the Serval and the first generation cross is Serval x domestic. Where colours have been added to a breed through outcrossing to another breed, not all registries accept the new colours under the original breed name e.g. Chocolate Persians and Lilac Persians may be recognised under the name \\"Kashmir\\" as the two colors were introduced through crossing to Siamese cats during the development of the Colourpoint Persian (UK) and Himalayan (USA).

He has represented the Scotland national team since 2008, including at the 2015 World Cup and the 2016 World Twenty20. He has played county cricket in England for Warwickshire and Durham. In January 2019, MacLeod was named the ICC Associate Player of the Year at the 2018 ICC Awards. Early life MacLeod was born in Glasgow. He attended Hillpark Secondary School, the Glasgow Gaelic School at the time. His family originally comes from the island of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides. Domestic and T20 franchise career As a youth MacLeod played for Drumpellier Cricket Club, where he made massive strides under the tutelage of Graham Robertson. Following the advice of Graham he moved to the Scottish National Cricket League Premier Division with Uddingston Cricket Club, as an opening bowler and middle order batsman. He played in the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka. After making some 70 appearance with Scotland age group sides (U12 to U23), he secured a retainer contract with Warwickshire for the 2006 season, to play Under-17s, Under-19s and 2nd XI cricket. Awarded an improved contract for 2007, he ended the season as joint top wicket-taker in the Warwickshire 2nd XI and was voted \\"Most Improved 2nd XI Player of the Year\\" by the County side. In November 2007 the 19-year-old MacLeod signed a two-year contract with Warwickshire. He spent winter 2007/8 playing Grade cricket for Penrith in Sydney and returned to Moseley Cricket Club as their contracted County player for 2008 in the Birmingham Premier Cricket League. MacLeod gained his full first-class Scotland cap when he was called up for the Intercontinental Cup match against the UAE in 2007, becoming the youngest Scottish player to debut at this level. During the 2008 Friends Provident series MacLeod played two matches against Durban and Yorkshire and was selected for two One Day International ties against Kenya both of which succumbed to rain. Despite international absences and a stomach injury which reduced his Warwickshire 2nd XI appearances, MacLeod's 2008 season ended with debut matches in the Warwickshire first team, both away from home, against Yorkshire a match abandoned due to rain and Derbyshire in a Pro40 win. In October, with another season still to run on his current deal, MacLeod was offered, and accepted, a new improved two-year contract to run until the end of the 2010 season. In 2014,he along with John Hastings holds the highest 6th wicket partnership in T20 history (126*) MacLeod spent the 2016 season playing for Boldon Cricket Club in the North East Premier League. In 2018, he commenced playing for Bexley in the Kent Premier League. In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Toronto Nationals franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. In July 2019, he was selected to play for the Edinburgh Rocks in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. International career His first ODI cap came in the historic match against England on 18 August 2008 where batting 9, he scored 10 not out facing 11 balls from Andrew Flintoff and Tim Bresnan before that game, too, fell victim to rain. As early as June 2009, during the World Twenty20, Warwickshire's coaching staff noticed that MacLeod's bowling action may have been problematic. After an Intercontinental Cup match against Canada in July 2010 in which MacLeod took six wickets, the umpires reported to the International Cricket Council that his action needed to be tested. In 2010, MacLeod was one of six cricketers given full-time contracts with Cricket Scotland. MacLeod did not play a single list A match in 2010. MacLeod was released by Warwickshire at the end of the 2010 season. Having left Warwickshire, MacLeod's next list A match was for Scotland in the 2011 Clydesdale Bank 40. The England Cricket Board had launched the competition the previous year and Scotland was included along with the Netherlands and the 18 first-class teams from England and Wales. Scotland won two of their twelve matches that year, had one no result and lost the rest, finishing bottom of their group. MacLeod managed 92 runs from six matches with a highest score of 33. In the 2011 Karp Hong Kong Super Sixes event MacLeod was placed 4th in the Championship Player stats, and 5th in the Batting stats. In March 2012 the UAE hosted the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. During Scotland's win against Oman, MacLeod scored 104 not out from 76 deliveries. With 307 runs from 9 matches (including one century and two fifties) he was Scotland's leading run- scorer in the tournament and fifth overall. Though Scotland progressed to the preliminary finals, they lost to the Netherlands in which MacLeod scored 57 from 42 in the match and failed to qualify for the World Twenty20 later that year. MacLeod made 175, the second highest score by an Associate player in an ODI and third highest by an Associate player in List A cricket, in a 170-run romp over Canada to seal a place for Scotland in the Super Sixes and put an end to Canada's consecutive World Cup streak dating back to 2003. MacLeod erased any chance of that happening with 175 off 141 balls in Scotland's total of 341 for 9. On 10 June 2018, Scotland secured the biggest win in their cricketing history with a six-run, first-ever, defeat of England with MacLeod scoring 140 not out with 16 fours and 3 sixes off 94 balls. In August 2019, during the 2019 Scotland Tri-Nation Series in Scotland, MacLeod scored his 2,000th run in ODI cricket. In September 2019, he was named in Scotland's squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates. Ahead of the tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named him as the key player in Scotland's squad. On 24 October 2019, in the match against Bermuda, MacLeod scored his 1,000th run in T20I cricket. Bowling action MacLeod was assisted by Warwickshire and Cricket Scotland to remodel his action.

It is a fusion of Indonesian and Western music, with roots in Kroncong (traditional Portuguese-Indonesian fusion music). The genre was invented by Indo repatriates in the Netherlands after Indonesian independence on August 17, 1945, and became popular especially in Germany. Indorock is one of the earliest forms of \\"Eurorock\\". Its influence on Dutch popular music was immense. History The guitar was imported to the archipelago of the East Indies by Portuguese explorers in the 16th century. The traditional Portuguese song styles, saudade and fado, played with guitar accompaniment, later became kroncong music. Many Indorock musicians had a predilection for Hawaiian music, which was popular in the Netherlands at the time. Other significant influences include American country & western, and the rock & roll repertoire played on radio stations in Indonesia via American (AFN) stations from the Philippines and Australia. The Tielman Brothers (Reggy, Ponthon, Andy and Loulou Tielman) are generally seen as founders of Indorock, even though other Indorock bands existed before them. Being ethnically Indonesian and playing black American music to white audiences in the Netherlands and Germany, their music exemplifies the complex background of the style, which, according to George Lipsitz, is shaped by \\"the histories of Dutch and U.S. military combat in Asia and Europe\\" and by the \\"internalized racial histories of the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany\\". Since the Dutch music industry offered few venues for Indorock artists, many of them went to Germany where it quickly became highly popular, at least until the advent of British beat music. Broader influence Indo vocal and instrumental guitar music groups started to record American hits and became famous, starting a stream within Europe known as the Indo Rock scene.

The film was produced by Ely Landau for the American Film Theatre, which presented thirteen film adaptations of plays in the United States from 1973 to 1975. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition. This was the last film for both Robert Ryan and Fredric March. March developed prostate cancer in 1970, causing him to retire from acting, while Ryan died before the film's release.

By 1985 interest had grown and at CALITE (1985) John Bowden led the foundation of the Australian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE). Since then ASCILITE has hosted annual conferences each December, apart from a collaborative venture with the World Conference on Computers in Education in 1990 when it was host to a special Computer Based Training session and a second collaboration with the TAFE and Schools sectors at the 1994 APITITE (Asia Pacific Information Technology in Training and Education) conference. During the late 1990s the Society's focus was broadening beyond Australia and in 1997 the Society's name was changed from ‘Australian’ to ‘Australasian’ to reflect the growing regional role that the Society was playing in the area of technology enhanced learning. The hosting of the 2002 conference in Auckland, New Zealand marked the twentieth conference and also the first time that ASCILITE was hosted outside Australia.

PDK thus participates in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of which pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first component. Both PDK and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are located in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotes. The complex acts to convert pyruvate (a product of glycolysis in the cytosol) to acetyl- coA, which is then oxidized in the mitochondria to produce energy, in the citric acid cycle. By downregulating the activity of this complex, PDK will decrease the oxidation of pyruvate in mitochondria and increase the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the cytosol. The opposite action of PDK, namely the dephosphorylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, is catalyzed by a phosphoprotein phosphatase called pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. (Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase should not be confused with Phosphoinositide- dependent kinase-1, which is also sometimes known as \\"PDK1\\".) Phosphorylation Sites PDK can phosphorylate a serine residue on pyruvate dehydrogenase at three possible sites. Some evidence has shown that phosphorylation at site 1 will nearly completely deactivate the enzyme while phosphorylation at sites 2 and 3 had only a small contribution to complex inactivation. Therefore, it is phosphorylation at site 1 that is responsible for pyruvate dehydrogenase deactivation. Isozymes There are four known isozymes of PDK in humans: * PDK1 * PDK2 * PDK3 * PDK4 The primary sequencing between the four isozymes are conserved with 70% identity. The greatest differences occur near the N-terminus. PDK1 is the largest of the four with 436 residues while PDK2, PDK3 and PDK4 have 407, 406, and 411 residues respectively. The isozymes have different activity and phosphorylation rates at each site. At site 1 in order from fastest to slowest, PDK2 > PDK4 ≈ PDK1 > PDK3. For site 2, PDK3 > PDK4 > PDK2 > PDK1. Only PDK1 can phosphorylate site 3. However, it has been shown that these activities are sensitive to slight changes in pH so the microenvironment of the PDK isozymes may change the reaction rates. Isozyme abundance has also been shown to be tissue specific. PDK1 is ample in heart cells. PDK3 is most abundant in testis. PDK2 is present in most tissues but low in spleen and lung cells. PDK4 is predominantly found in skeletal muscle and heart tissues. Mechanism Pyruvate dehydrogenase is deactivated when phosphorylated by PDK. Normally, the active site of pyruvate dehydrogenase is in a stabilized and ordered conformation supported by a network of hydrogen bonds. However, phosphorylation by PDK at site 1 causes steric clashes with another nearby serine residue due to both the increased size and negative charges associated with the phosphorylated residue. This disrupts the hydrogen bond network and disorders the conformation of two phosphorylation loops. These loops prevent the reductive acetylation step, thus halting overall activity of the enzyme. The conformational changes and mechanism of deactivation for phosphorylation at sites 2 and 3 are not known at this time. Regulation PDK isozyme 4 with ADP bound in the active site. ADP has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase is activated by ATP, NADH and acetyl-CoA. It is inhibited by ADP, NAD+, CoA-SH and pyruvate. Each isozyme responds to each of these factors slightly differently. NADH stimulates PDK1 activity by 20% and PDK2 activity by 30%. NADH with acetyl-CoA increases activity in these enzymes by 200% and 300% respectively. In similar conditions, PDK3 is unresponsive to NADH and inhibited by NADH with acetyl-CoA. PDK4 has a 200% activity increase with NADH, but adding acetyl-CoA does not increase activity further. Disease relevance Some studies have shown that cells that lack insulin (or are insensitive to insulin) overexpress PDK4. As a result, the pyruvate formed from glycolysis cannot be oxidized which leads to hyperglycaemia due to the fact that glucose in the blood cannot be used efficiently. Therefore, several drugs target PDK4 hoping to treat type II diabetes. PDK1 has shown to have increased activity in hypoxic cancer cells due to the presence of HIF-1. PDK1 shunts pyruvate away from the citric acid cycle and keeps the hypoxic cell alive. Therefore, PDK1 inhibition has been suggested as an antitumor therapy since PDK1 prevents apoptosis in these cancerous cells. Similarly, PDK3 has been shown to be overexpressed in colon cancer cell lines. Three proposed inhibitors are AZD7545 and dichloroacetate which both bind to PDK1, and Radicicol which binds to PDK3. Mutations in the PDK3 gene are a rare cause of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX6). In dogs, specifically Doberman Pinschers, a mutation in the PDK4 gene is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

Biography  Kleinschmidt was born in Bublitz, Pomerania, German Empire (modern Bobolice, Poland). As a student of art at the Berlin Akademie Kleinschmidt's greatest influence was Anton von Werner, who was at the time Kleinschmidt's history art teacher.Paul Kleinschmidt - Biography and Offers During his time as a student Kleinschmidt met Lovis Corinth who became an informative and strongly educational individual for the young student. Kleinschmidt continued his studies in 1904 under Peter Halm's direction, as well as Heirnrich von Zügel at the Akademie in Munich. It was in Munich that he learned the techniques of lithography and engraving. Eventually finding his way to Berlin to work as a painter and graphic artist, Kleinschmidt exhibited at the modest 'Sezession' shows in 1908 and 1911. In 1915, Kleinschmidt began teaching drawing while also taking the role of a technical draughtsman, during which time a great majority of his most remarkable lithographs and engravings were created. Offering these pieces in his first solo exhibition, organized by the Euphorion publishing company in 1923, Kleinschmidt's work would next see light in 1925 at Fritz Gurlitt in Berlin, thereafter graduating to a painting oriented focus. Kleinschmidt was first introduced to a New York City art collector by the name of Erich Cohn in 1927. A man who later became his sponsor. Kleinschmidt made several rapid moves from Berlin throughout Southern Germany in 1932 ending up in Ulm and within a year's time, Ay near Senden. Shortly thereafter, he and his family found a great struggle in the midst of a political repression. Finally finding a path of emigration to the Netherlands in 1936, Kleinschmidt relieved himself and family of such political angst, from there to France in 1938. He was taken prisoner in February 1940 throughout several camps for a short span but released again post-French capitulation. Kleinschmidt was forced to stop painting in 1943 under direction of the Nazis during his final years in Bensheim. In 1945, the entirety of his possessions were lost to an air raid. Kleinschmidt died on August 2, 1949 as result of a severe angina pectoris diagnosed in 1940. A number of his works include: Berghang am See; Titelblatt der Ausstellung Grafik E.L.

He is tied for fifth on the California state high school list for most assists in a season (44 assists in 1982–1983). Hooker attended and played soccer at UCLA for three seasons between 1983 and 1987. He played as a freshman, but redshirted the 1984 season to play for the U.S. in the 1984 Summer Olympics. He was injured in 1985 while playing with the national team and did not play for UCLA during the school's run to the NCAA championship. He finally got back on the field for UCLA in 1986. In 1987, he played his last season for UCLA, but did not complete his bachelor's degree until 1992. Over his three seasons with the Bruins, Hooker played in 51 games, scoring 20 goals and assisting on 11 other. =National and Olympic teams= Hooker's reputation at the high school level led to his selection for the U.S. U-20 national team at the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship in Mexico. He scored in his first game in that tournament, a 2–3 loss to Uruguay and earned three junior national team caps. He also represented the U.S. at the 1983 Pan American Games. Hooker earned his first cap with the U.S. national team in an October 9, 1984 victory over El Salvador. That day, both he and fellow rookie Jacques LaDouceur became one of the few first game tandems to score in a game, which the U.S. won 3–1. Hooker also played thirteen games for the U.S. B-Team which at the time formed the core of the U.S. Olympic Team, World University Team and Pan American Team. =Professional= In 1986, Hooker played a single season as a forward with the San Diego Nomads of the Western Soccer Alliance (WSA) during the collegiate off-season. After leaving UCLA, he went on to play for the Los Angeles Heat of the WSA in 1988 and 1989. His second season with the team saw him rise to sixth on the alliance's points list with 19 on 7 goals and 5 assists. He was also named to the WSA First Team All Star team. In 1991, he joined the Colorado Foxes of the American Professional Soccer League, which was formed by the merger of the Western Soccer Alliance and the American Soccer League in 1990. Hooker remained with the Foxes during its glory years of 1991 to 1995. The team consistently finished towards the top of the league's rankings and took the championship in 1992 and 1993.

However, in the Professional Cup, he scored two goals with one coming in the Foxes 4–1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rowdies. In 1995, he scored 7 goals. There are no records for his other seasons with the Foxes. Coaching In 1992, besides playing professionally with the Colorado Foxes, Hooker became head coach of the University of Denver women's soccer team, guiding them to a Colorado Athletic Conference championship. In 2002 and 2003, Hooker was named the Sun Belt Conference coach of the year. In 1996 and 1997, he also served as the school's men's soccer coach. During those two seasons, he compiled a 20–12–4 record.

In 1946 Claude Paillat, started a career as a journalist and in 1949 joins the weekly Paris-Match, who sent him to Indochina and to Korea. For several years he followed the political events in Morocco and Algeria. In 1961, he published his first book: Le Dossier Secret de l'Algérie, 1958-1961. This book marked a turning point in writing French contemporary history, it brought investigative journalism, personal accounts from some of the main actors, oral testimony that broke the veil of state secrets. In 1972, he establishes his series of secret files on contemporary France, Dossiers Secrets de la France Contemporaine. Based on memories and documents, most published for the very first time, rare photographs, often taken from family archives, the Dossiers Secrets take us through the events of the end of World War I and its disastrous Treaty of Versailles until the end of the Second World War. The Dossiers Secrets offer the most original perspective on our knowledge of France in the 20th century, not only in Paris, but also from the main economic regions such as Lille, Nantes, Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseille. Through Claude Paillat's work many key figures have been able to relate their stories, events that may have otherwise never been committed to paper. Paillat was a journalist who became a best- selling historian. His most significant work is his eight-volume Dossiers secrets de la France contemporaine, a series that covers the span of French history from the conclusion of the First World War to the end of the Second. He also published a two-volume study of the Algerian War; a monograph on the French defeat in Indochina, as well as one on the last turbulent year of Charles de Gaulle's presidency; and a two part history of the Catholic Church in France. Paillat's books enjoyed popular success while at the same time being based on exhaustive research. He not only made use of various French archives, he also relied on the extensive contacts he had made across French society, including members of the military, leading industrialists, and politicians. These contacts allowed Paillat to consult, and in some cases acquire, personal collections of correspondence and other documents, many of which formed the basis of the detailed descriptions of events and personalities in his books. His exclusive access to such documents also give Paillat's books - most of which contain the word \\"secret\\" in the title - the aspect of revealing confidential or privileged information. Paillat referred to his research methods as yielding a \\"tapestry\\" woven from various sources. The Research Materials are arranged according to Paillat's original French subject headings, with additional identification provided at the folder level. The materials include copies of many official documents, private correspondence, as well as clippings and academic studies. There are numerous military records - intelligence reports, campaign journals and correspondence - relating to the French experience in World War II. There are also many documents generated by the French national police (Gendarmerie Nationale) during the Vichy period. Additionally, there are copies of reports on France in the 1930s originating from the United States embassy in Paris, as well as other American documents concerning France and North Africa in World War II. The Paillat papers contain substantial materials emanating from the French colonial administrations in Indochina and North Africa. The Indochina materials span the period from the 1920s to the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, and include some documents describing the increasing American involvement in Vietnam in the 1950s. There are extensive materials in the collection pertaining to the Algerian War, including many documents relating both to the Algerian nationalist movement and the military rebellion by rightwing French officers against de Gaulle. There are also many police and intelligence reports from Algeria in the 1920s and 1930s. The research materials are particularly rich in the local and regional history of France. Paillat was interested in documenting the family histories of the French economic elite ( patronat) and conducted many interviews with members of this social class. The collection has numerous tape recordings and transcripts of these interviews. There is extensive documentation of the interwar years in France, on domestic politics and little studied movements such as Bourgeoisie Chrétienne, Redressement Français, and X-Crise. There are also materials relating to various social reform initiatives in France, including documents acquired by Paillat from the personal collections of Aymé Bernard and Achille Liénart. The Paillat papers contain press accounts and leaflets pertaining to the protest movement of French students and workers in May–June 1968. There are also significant materials on the years following de Gaulle's resignation as president, including the Mitterrand era. These largely relate to French political parties, election campaigns, and a number of public scandals involving allegations of corruption and bribery. The Correspondence series contains a large general file that is arranged chronologically. This consists largely of letters received by Paillat from the readers of his books, as well as a considerable number of letters from the contacts who provided him information and documents in aid of his research. The Writings series of the papers contain the drafts of many of Paillat's books, as well as his correspondence with his publishers, readers, and those sources who had provided him with information and documents for the writing of his books. In this series, there are also numerous articles written by Paillat during his career as a journalist for the newspaper, Le Canard enchaîné. The articles focus on French politics as well reporting on business trends among French media companies. Claude Paillat's archives have been acquired by the Hoover Institution, Stanford University in California. The archives contain many interviews and papers relating to French political and economic history in the 20th century. Access to the archives can be made through the Hoover Institute and a register of the archives are being made at Paillat Archives. Acquired in 2008, the Claude Paillat papers in the Hoover Institution Archives represent a substantial documentary resource on modern French history. At present, they are the single largest collection relating to France in the holdings of the archives. The large bulk of the papers consists of the research materials used by Paillat in the preparation of his books on France during the period between the end of World War I and the aftermath of World War II. There are additional materials relating to the wars in Indochina and Algeria; to the local and regional history of 20th century France; to the presidencies of Charles de Gaulle, Georges Pompidou, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and François Mitterrand; and to French economic history. The collection includes 435 manuscript boxes, 14 card file boxes, 4 oversize boxes a total of 183.7 linear feet.

Layers of Upper Carboniferous (Namurian) sedimentary rocks, Loop Head, County Clare The geology of Ireland consists of the study of the rock formations on the island of Ireland. It includes rocks from every age from Proterozoic to Holocene and a large variety of different rock types is represented. The basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway together with geologically significant sections of the adjacent coast have been declared a World Heritage Site. The geological detail follows the major events in Ireland's past based on the geological timescale. __TOC__ Timeline Slieve League in western Ulster The oldest known Irish rock is about 1.7 billion years old and is found on Inishtrahull Island off the north coast of Ulster. Outcrops at Annagh Head on the Mullet Peninsula are almost as old. In other parts of Donegal, scientists have discovered rocks that originated as glacial deposits, demonstrating that at this early period, part of what was to become Ireland was in the grip of an ice age. However, because of the effects of later upheavals, it is almost impossible to sequence these early rock layers correctly. About 600 million years ago, at the end of the Precambrian super-eon, what would later become the Irish landmass was in two parts, with one half on the north-western side of the Iapetus Ocean in Laurentia and the other on the south-eastern side in the micro-continent Avalonia, both at a latitude of around 80° South, close to what is now northwest Africa. From the evidence of the Oldhamia fossils found at Bray Head in Leinster, both parts of Ireland were below sea level at this time. Over the next 150 million years, these two parts moved towards each other, eventually uniting about 440 million years ago. Fossils discovered near Clogherhead, County Louth, show the coming together of shoreline fauna from both sides of the original dividing ocean. The mountains of northwest Ireland were formed during the collision, as was the granite that is found in locations in Donegal and Wicklow. The Irish landmass was now above sea level and lying near the equator, and fossil traces of land-based life forms survive from this period. These include fossilised trees from Kiltorcan, County Kilkenny, widespread bony fish and freshwater mussel fossils and the footprints of a four-footed amphibian preserved in slate on Valentia Island in Munster. Old Red Sandstone also formed at this time. Between 400 million and 300 million years ago, parts of Northwest Europe, including much of Ireland, sank beneath a warm tropical sea. Great coral reefs formed in these waters, eventually creating the limestone that still makes up about 65 per cent of the area of the island. As the waters receded, tropical forests and swamps flourished. The resulting vegetation eventually formed coal, most of which was later eroded. This period, known as the Carboniferous period, ended with further tectonic movement which saw Ireland drift further northward. The resulting pressure created those Irish mountain and hill ranges that run in a northeast to southwest direction. =Mesozoic= Karst landscape in the Burren By 250 million years ago, Ireland was at the latitude of present-day Egypt and had a desert climate. It was at this time that most of the coal and sandstone were eroded. The thinner layers of limestone in the south of the country were also partially affected by this erosion. The limestone that was exposed by the disappearance of its sandstone mantle was subject to solution by weakly acidic water resulting in a karstic landscape that can still be seen in the Burren in County Clare. Shortly after this period, organic debris in the seas around Ireland began to form the natural gas and petroleum deposits that now play a role in the economy of Ireland. Then, about 150 million years ago, Ireland was again submerged, this time in a chalky sea that resulted in the formation of chalk over large parts of the surface. Traces of this survive under the basalt lava that is found in parts of the north. About 66 million years ago, the volcanic activity that formed this lava began. The Mourne Mountains and other mountains in the northern part of the island formed as a result of this activity. Climatic conditions at this time were warm and vegetation thrived. Vegetable debris in the Antrim Depression formed deposits of brown coal or lignite which remain untouched down to the present time. The warm conditions produced high rainfall that accelerated processes of erosion and the formation of karstic landscape forms. =Cenozoic= By 25 million years ago, Ireland was close to assuming its present position. From then on, a long period of erosion resulted in considerable soil formation mantling most of the bedrock. In areas with good drainage, the covering consisted of brown or grey soil, while in poorly drained areas, black clay tended to dominate. As the climate cooled, soil formation slowed, and a flora and fauna that would millions of years later be familiar to the first human inhabitants began to emerge. The present landscape of Ireland had more or less formed. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had a thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's smoothed landforms. Since about 1.7 million years ago, the Earth has been subjected to a cycle of warm and cold stages and these have, inevitably, affected Ireland. The earliest evidence we have for this effect comes from the period known as the Ballylinian Warm Stage, some half a million years ago. At this time, most of what are now considered to be native Irish trees were already established on the island. The action of the ice during the cold stages was the major factor in bringing the Irish landscape to its current form. Obvious impacts of the ice on the landscape include the formation of glacial valleys such as Glendalough in Wicklow and of corries, or glacial lakes. The depositing of mounds of debris under the melting ice created drumlins, a common feature of the landscape across the north midlands. Streams also formed under the ice and the material deposited by these formed eskers (Irish eiscir). The greatest of these, the Esker Riada, divides the northern and southern halves of the island and its ridge once served as the main highway connecting the east and west coasts. About one half of the coastline consists of a low-lying dune pasture land known as machair. Rocks and soil types Layers of siltstone, shale and sandstone can be seen in the Cliffs of Moher, near Doolin in Munster The large central lowland is of limestone covered with glacial deposits of clay and sand, with widespread bogs and lakes. The Bog of Allen is one of the largest bogs. The coastal mountains vary greatly in geological structure. In the south, the mountains are composed of Old Red Sandstone with limestone river valleys. Around the Ulster/Connacht border, the mountains are made from Carboniferous sandstones with softer Carboniferous limestones below them. In central Ulster, the mountains are predominantly made from metamorphic rocks. In the west of both Connacht and Ulster, the mountains are mostly metamorphic rocks with some granite. The Mourne and Wicklow Mountains are mainly granite. Much of the northeast of Ireland is a basalt plateau. An area of particular note is the Giant's Causeway on the north coast, a mainly basalt formation caused by volcanic activity between 50–60 million years ago. The basalts were originally part of the great Thulean Plateau formed during the Paleogene period.Brittle tectonism in relation to the Palaeogene evolution of the Thulean/NE Atlantic domain: a study in Ulster (Subscription required) Retrieved on 10 November 2007 The soils of the north and west tend to be poorly drained peats and gleys, including peaty podzols. In contrast, in the south and east the soils are free-draining brown earths and brown and grey- brown podzols. An unusual environment is present in north Clare, in the Burren. This karst landscape consists of limestone bedrock, with little or no soil in the innermost areas. There are numerous sinkholes, where surface water disappears through the porous rock surface, and extensive cave systems have been formed in some areas. Doolin Cave is the site of one of the world's longest known free-hanging stalactites.

The application includes the following features: * ZIP/ZIP64 compression * AES 128 & AES 256 encryption * Backup filters (by extension, subdirectory, regular expression, size, date, status, usage) * Incremental backup, differential and full backup support * Delta backup (only the modified parts of the files will be stored, not the whole files) * Archives merges * As of date recovery * Transaction mechanism (with commit/rollback management) for all critical processes (such as backups or merges) to guarantee backups' integrity * Unix file permissions backup/recovery * E-Mail reports * Backup simulation * FTP and FTPS support (SSL/TLS in both implicit and explicit modes) * SFTP support (with password or certificate authentication) Areca also provides all tools needed to handle your archives: * Backup * Archive recovery (with or without deleted files); entire archives or single files can be easily recovered * Archive merge: contiguous incremental archives can be merged into a single archive to save storage space * Archive deletion * History explorer: different versions of a given file can be browsed and restored * Archive explorer: files can be searched among your archives Storage modes Areca can handle multiple storage modes: * Standard: It is the default mode, which is recommended for most users: If you choose this storage mode, a new archive will be created for each backup. All new or modified files since the last backup will be stored in this archive. * Delta: This mode is recommended for advanced users only: If you choose this storage mode, a new archive will be created for each backup. All modified *parts* of files since the last backup will be stored in this archive. This mode is particularly useful if you are handling large files. * Image: If you choose this storage mode, a unique archive will be created and updated at each backup. Backup types Areca can handle the following types of backups: * Full Backup: When a full backup is performed, ALL files are stored in your archive (whether they have been modified or not). * Incremental backup: When an incremental backup is performed, only the files which have been modified since the last backup are stored in your archive. * Differential backup: When a differential backup is performed, only the files which have been modified since the last FULL backup are stored in your archive. Areca uses the file's size and last modification time to detect modified files. If one of these attributes is modified (whatever its value is), the file is flagged as modified. This allows a fast detection of modified files. Areca is downloadable pre-packaged for Linux and Windows 2000/Windows XP and Windows Vista. But it also runs on any other operating system, provided that a Java Runtime Environment has been installed (version 1.4.2 or later). It has been translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish.  Limitations  * Areca Backup does not have a built in method of handling automated backup creation for Windows-based operating systems. The user is required to configure a backup strategy using an included Wizard, which consequently creates a collection of bat files required to be manually added to the Windows Task Scheduler. * Areca Backup does not support VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) and cannot backup files that are locked by other programs, but there are plugins for Areca that do (like ArecaVSS) External links * Areca Backup official website Category:Free backup software Category:Free software programmed in Java (programming language) ","title":"Areca Backup"},{"id":"9499230","text":"Sutton Community Academy (formerly Sutton Centre Community College) is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form with academy status, located in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, England.

Its philosophy is closely linked to the French animal rights movement and is also supported by xenofeminists, who advocate for a form of cyberfeminism, as well as transhumanists. Notable advocates include David Olivier and Yves Bonnardel.  Philosophy  Antinaturalists defend the inherent and absolute moral permissibility of abortion, body modification, divorce, contraception, sex reassignment surgery and other means by which they believe human beings can assume control of their own bodies and their own environments. Antinaturalism stands in contrast to some radical environmentalist movements, which state that nature itself is sacred and should be preserved for its own sake, instead advancing the idea that all human acts are natural and that ecological preservation is important inasmuch as it is necessary for the well-being of sentient beings, not because of some inherently sacred attribute of nature as a whole. Yves Bonnardel argues that naturalist ideology \\"goes hand in hand with and legitimises speciesist oppression of non-human sentient beings\\" and that using natural law to justify the reintroduction of predatory animals to control populations of other animals is a form of speciesism.

Established July 10, 2000Origin of GU Comics (1st Strip) Posted July 10, 2000 and launched August 15, 2000,Launch of GU Comics Posted August 15, 2000 GU is published, free, five times a week on its own web site. The comic focuses on a single video game such as World of Warcraft; but, it also comments on gaming industry and community news, often lampooning gamers in general through the adventures of Hearn and his fictional roommate, Ted, and occasionally parodies contemporary social, political, and personal issues related to the online and general video game world. In recent months Hearn has focused primarily on writing comics revolving around various pen-and-paper role playing games; it is unclear if Hearns actually takes part in these games or if he simply finds humor in D&D; sourcebooks over PC MMO games. History GU Comics was first released to a small group of friends on July 10, 2000. Then known as \\"/gu ...\\", the original comics were set inside the MMOG fantasy world of EverQuest and centered on the in-game antics of the artist and members of his guild (Purifying Light on Vallon Zek). Intended only as a hobby, the comic's link was passed around to various EverQuest related community sites (Evercrest.Com being chief among them). On July 25, GU was contacted by the GameFan/Game Answer Network with an offer of affiliation and a proposal to go \\"live\\". Now hosted on the GameFan/Game Answer Network, GU was released for wide public consumption August 15, 2000. The response was swift and significant. Since its inception GU has change hosts for various reasons. February 4, 2003, GU moved to TheSafehouse.org. On February 5, 2003, signifying the move to the Safehouse and a shift in interest to the wider gaming world rather than focusing specifically on EverQuest, the slash and ellipses were officially dropped from the GU logo. As of April 9, 2007 the format of the comic was shifted from 300x465 to 600x450. Along with the format shift the logo, and comic type sub-text was removed from the strip. Public Appearances GU Comics had featured costume contests for its readers for Halloween, unofficial gatherings at various conventions, gaming trade shows, and the Texas Renaissance Festival. In addition, Hearn had been invited to review the development of and write NDA-approved PR pieces for various games, including Vanguard: Saga of Heroes.Sigil Games News Archive GU Comics has been featured in many online webzines and print media, including Gamespy,Gamespy.com 's Stratics MMOG Weekly: Volume 29 A Laugh A Day Keeps the GM Away, Feb 2002 Joystiq,Joystiq: GU Comics grants wishes: Hsu vs. Moore GamePolitics.com,GamePolitics.com \\"Web Comic Riffs on Pope's Video Game Criticism\\" , Thursday, February 1st, 2007 MMORPG.Com,MMORPG.Com Humor: Comics MMORPGamer,MMORPGamer Issue #65, July 4, 2006 Computer Games Magazine,Computer Games Magazine Issue 167 (page 69 \\"The Acute Angler\\" and page 73 \\"Get Peso for Plat\\") Der Spielekurier,Der Spielekurier October 2004 (page 15 \\"Online Comics\\") and the film Avatars Offline.Avatars Offline (Documentary 2002) Several GUComics relevant to World of WarcraftWorld of Warcraft were referenced in the official Community NewsWoW Community News Archive 2006 of World of Warcraft Europe.

Plot It is the first anniversary of Uuno (Vesa-Matti Loiri) and Elisabet (Marjatta Raita). Uuno has placed a bet with his friend Härski- Hartikainen (Spede Pasanen) a year ago, that if Uuno can take just one year of marriage with Elisabet, Hartikainen will treat him a festive dinner. However, Hartikainen buys a lottery ticket for Uuno, who agrees to deduct it from his debt - and the festive dinner is reduced to a can of milk and half a sausage. As it happens, Uuno becomes the lottery winner of 1.5 million marks, only to soon realize he doesn't own a single penny yet. Mister Tossavainen (Seppo Laine) arrives and offers to finance Uuno before he actually gets the jackpot. Thus, Uuno gets to live a rich live on credit. He buys a raccoon fur, leopard swimming trunks and a couple of Mercedes-Benzes. Women begin to fancy Uuno and so does his father-in-law (Tapio Hämäläinen). As time goes by it is revealed, though, that Uuno is not actually a lottery winner, and so he has to escape the anger of others to Härski's car repair shop.

In United States Following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which made deportation mandatory for certain aliens sentenced to a year or more of imprisonment for an aggravated felony conviction. In 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was abolished and replaced by the now Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In 2004, the DHS launched Operation Endgame, a strategy to remove all deportable aliens. In 2005, a Homeland Security Spending Bill increased funds for immigration law enforcement to ten billion dollars, significantly raising the number of border patrol agents, immigration investigators and interior detention personnel. In 2006, Congress began considering more reform proposals that would impose even harsher restrictions for aliens who have broken the law and expand the definition of deportable crimes even further. As a result, minor past offenses can increasingly be used as grounds for expulsion.  Other countries and territories  Anyone deported from Canada for violating immigration law and criminal laws will have to successfully apply for an authorization to return, although such an authorization may or may not be granted. Any non-citizen of a European Union member state or territory ever given a life sentence or otherwise given a determinate sentence of at least 4 years will typically, if living in the UK proper, be deported. Any non-citizen resident of New Zealand who has ever been given a prison sentence of at least 5 years will typically be deported from that British Commonwealth member state, with any other non-citizen resident who has, within the past decade before deportation, otherwise served a sentence of at least 12 months. Any non-citizen resident with a \\"substantial criminal record\\" (even if such record does not include sex offences) will typically be removed from Australia if living there. However, the Australian Administrative Tribunals has stopped the deportation of many convicts for various reasons. https://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=mig/report/criminal_deportation/chapter3.pdf Some of the countries in the Persian Gulf have deported foreign nationals as well as their own citizens.

In partnership with bases, wings, and units the Canadian Forces Regular Forces and Canadian Forces Primary Reserve members, retired and former members, military families, Department of National Defence employees, NPF employees, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) personnel, receive the morale and welfare programs, services, and activities needed. History Prior to Unification of the Canadian Forces, virtually all Non-Public Property (NPP) activities were controlled and managed at the local level. In 1969, Treasury Board introduced the concept of delivering Morale and Welfare programs through a combination of Public and NPP resources. Immediately upon Unification in 1968, the Director General Personnel Services (DGPS) was created, reporting to the Chief of Personnel. DGPS was responsible for NPP operations and Publicly funded fitness training and sports programs. At the same time, most resale activities were consolidated under the newly created CANEX. In 1996, all elements of Public and NPP Morale and Welfare program delivery were consolidated under a single NPP organization, CFPSA. Specific Public Morale and Welfare programs were delivered through the NPP organization administered by CFPSA, with the cost of implementation reimbursed by the Public to NPP. Effective April 21, 2008, the Non-Public Property Board approved a name change for the organization from the Canadian Forces Personnel Support Agency (CFPSA) to the Canadian Forces Personnel and Family Support Services (CFPFSS). CFPFSS was formed to consolidate personnel and family support across the Canadian Forces under a single organization. On April 15, 2013, the Non-Public Property Board approved a second name change for the organization from CFPFSS to Canadian Forces Morale and Welfare Services. This name change aimed to strengthen the association of the name with the programs and services delivered by the organization.

It serves the people there by collecting waste (including garden waste, hazardous waste, clinical waste and bulky waste), recycling glass and paper, as well as other specialist waste services. The company started in 1898 under the name Kjøbenhavns Grundejeres Renholdningsselskab, shortened to KGR. Then its task was to empty and wash latrine buckets, in the jargon called \\"removal of night soil\\". The buckets were carried to Amager, where they built a cleaning station. From this Amager got the unattractive nickname Lorteøen (the shit island). In 1984 the container department Renoflex was eliminated from R98 because of problems with solutions for industrial waste and garbage collection outside the coverage. In 2003 tenders were invited for the collection of garden refuse and bulky refuse in containers. This was due to (for instance) dissatisfaction from other haulage contractors because the task without supplies was carried out by Renoflex, and they thought this was unfair. This led to a splitting up of the contract into two districts (north and south) that are served by two separate companies. In a 2005 case R98's 30-year contract with the municipalities for the collection of refuse was declared illegal. After this the planning of the call for tenders of this area started, and at the same time one agreed to that the service in the course of time was to be transferred to be a municipal task. Because of the size of the task's, tenders were invited over a short period of years. The company should be finally eliminated and the necessary staff transferred to the two municipalities. R98 is a non-profit company and must therefore not make money on handling of waste.

It is a realistic interpretation of pool and snooker. The game was initially published by Midas Interactive, but since 2012 it has been distributed exclusively by Bulldog through the official Cue Club website. Gameplay Demonstrating a swerve shot in 8-ball pool, practice mode Cue Club uses a fixed, overhead view of the table, with the user's mouse serving as a controller. The game features a tournament mode, practice mode, quick game, two-player head-to-head, and a bonus \\"slam\\" mode where the balls can be hurled around with the mouse. Different rules are available including eight- ball, nine-ball, speed pool, killer and snooker, along with the ability to customize the rules for eight-ball to replicate the game's many variants. A large selection of table designs, ball sets and cues are provided, with settings for fast and slow cloth speeds, and different methods to cue. The game also features a series of themed 'Virtual Chat Rooms' that the player is free to explore, subject to certain conditions. For example, access may be restricted due to overcrowding, or male players may be turned away if it is already occupied by too many men. Gameplay in snooker mode Once inside, players interact by sending chat messages and requesting games through a dialogue box. Often the conversation contains banter and joking. If a match is agreed upon, the challengers go off to play. Winners are rewarded with an increase in reputation, allowing them to play higher-ranked opponents and progress through the game's various levels. A loss usually involves a reduction in reputation, making it more difficult to get matches in the future, forcing the player to challenge lower-ranked opponents. When the player attains the maximum 5-star reputation, the 'boss' of the chat room will usually agree to play. By defeating the boss, the player's membership to that room is upgraded from standard to silver, entitling them to certain privileges. In tournament mode players compete for the eight trophies on offer (one for each chat room). When all eight trophies have been won, the player then competes for the ultimate prize of the Grand Cue Club Trophy, which is the hardest tournament and features all of the bosses. After all of the 'boss' characters have been individually defeated and the Cue Club Tournament has been won, the game is officially completed and an end-game sequence is played. As a further bonus, the winner is awarded a 'gold-card' membership to the chat rooms, which guarantees access and preserves the player's 5-star reputation. Critical response Reviews from the gaming press were favourable. Despite embracing a simple top-down view of the table, reviewers often cited the game's accurate physics engine, realistic graphics and high degree of playability as its key strengths. PC Gamer magazine were less impressed, scoring it at 60%, saying, \\"Despite its other graphical jiggling and poking, that fixed, flat view makes it feel like an 'Internet game'.\\" They did give credit to Bulldog Interactive for the efforts that they put into the game's physics but said that other similar games \\"are more likely to make you want to put your coins on the table.\\" Cue Club 2 On 4 July 2014, fourteen years after the original release, Bulldog Interactive released a sequel to the game entitled Cue Club 2. The game was released via the official Cue Club website and Steam.

Postnaturalism is a cultural process whereby organisms are bred to satisfy a specific cultural purpose. It can be used to read these organisms, which serve as insights into our culture by reflecting desires and beliefs prevalent at the time of breeding. This has direct implications for the evolutionary path of these organisms, whittling down undesirable traits to leave only those culturally sought out. Postnaturalism argues that in so doing, humans have and continue to actively alter the evolutionary path of a postnatural organism to suit our cultural desires. The agricultural practice of monoculture, for instance, is just one example of postnatural organisms who have been bred to such an extent that the modern-day species look nothing like their pre- neolithic counterparts. The breeding of these species for this purpose can be seen to be reflected in notable diet changes during this period, which proliferated during ensuing sedentism and urbanisation. Postnaturalism is a highly selective process. For every organism that has become used in our society, there are countless more that have remained non-postnatural for whatever reason ranging from a perceived lack of future use from them or traits that make them too difficult to farm. One such example is the golden orb-weaver spider which produces a strong, light and useful silk, however they are known to be cannibalistic and thus impossible to farm on a large scale. Postnatural History Postnatural history is defined as the \\"study of the origins, habitats, and evolution of organisms that have been intentionally and heritably altered by humans\\", which serves as a \\"record of the influence of human culture on evolution\\". So termed to differentiate it from traditional natural history studies, it is the subject of a storefront in Pittsburgh, United States called the Center for PostNatural History, which builds on this concept to produce an array of displays of organisms which are all postnatural. Domestication The commencement of the postnatural can be considered to date back to prehistoric civilisation's early interaction with wild species. Here, domestication occurred as a way of adapting the environment around prehistoric people to suit their needs and desires through a gradual process of refinement. Domestication succeeds through the heritable continuation of an organism's phenotype and genotype allowing each generation to continue on from their previous generation. In its simplest terms, domestication alters a species through survival to a change in habitat, food source, or other significant change. These changes can be sought for a variety of different reasons including physical attributes, behavioural characteristics, lifespan, and adaptability to a change in environment. It is thought human beings have been experimenting with selectively breeding organisms for around 10,000 years; over thousands of years humans have influenced many taxonomic groups, with bioengineering representing new forms of genetic information transfer, creation, and inheritance, coupled to climate change, scientists and policy makers are prioritising “ecosystem services” essential to humans, such as pollination, the replenishment of fish stocks, and a phenomenon being researched in the Great Barrier Reef being the terminal decline of coral. Selective breeding Postnatural practices include selective breeding, a process by which humans purposefully breed certain organisms for particular biological traits. The practice was known to the Romans, and has been commonly used continuing to this day. Michael Pollan argues that Charles Darwin saw this process and considered it artificial, rather than natural, selection, but in terms of evolutionary progress this distinction becomes irrelevant to the species; the change is irreversible all the same. This is simply because evolution is understood to be unable to 'undo' previous changes, but, particularly in proteins, continues along in a progression of its biological structure depending on what traits are required for survival. Induced Mutation Induced mutation in the context of postnaturalism is the process whereby a specific genetic mutation - usually a rare occurrence - is selectively isolated by people and encouraged to reproduce in future offspring. This differs from the general understanding of a mutation that was induced by treatment from a particular chemical agent in a living species. A good example of this is the albino rat which possesses, in the wild a notoriously fatal genetic make-up making it much easier to identify to predators, a coat which drew interest in breeders so as to distinguish them from their more unhygienic-looking sewer counterparts prevalent in major cities in the 1800s. So numerous were rats in industrial cities, they became the subject of a sport based on their extermination, rat-baiting. The albino rat thus became distinguished from the regular unsightly sewer rat and even became sold as pets, the owning of one as a child allegedly the basis for Beatrix Potter's book Samuel Whiskers. Genetic Engineering Genetic Engineering can be considered to be the purposeful alteration of the genetic makeup of an organism through the introduction of genes from sources not belonging to that organism. The isolation of a particular gene and introduction of another is often achieved through the use of biotechnology more broadly. Genetic engineering is a contentious topic and even in searching for a definition, there are several alternatives available highlighting the variation in perceptions around what is considered to be the goal and process of genetic engineering. However, genetic engineering embodies much of what is considered postnatural, but doing so with the next level of technology than used in previous methods such as those mentioned in the above sections. Increased use of advanced technology allows for improved precision and accuracy of methods, and carrying out of transgenics, whilst the use of laboratories as settings is designed to prevent the release of experimented organisms into the wild unless cleared with the relevant protocols and regulations beforehand. Concerns over postnaturalism's proliferation in monoculture The current agricultural practice of monoculture is intricately connected with postnaturalism, particularly now much of common contemporary agricultural practice has become mechanised. This mechanisation sometimes requires universality to comply with existing tools, machines and practices, such as the breeding of chickens to be a uniform size to ensure they fit into chicken harvesting machines. On other occasions rather than breed a particular species to a uniform size, some parts of organisms have been so heavily bred and altered that dystocia can regularly occur, such as with the Belgian Blue cattle whose birth canal regularly becomes constricted or even entirely blocked due to the birth canal's reduced size and the increased size of calves. The result is the routine scheduling of Caesarian sections.

Among others, he is the only player in NBA history to average 40 and 50 points in a season, score 100 points in a single game, and grab over 2,000 rebounds in a single season. He also won seven scoring, nine field goal percentage, and 11 rebounding titles in addition to an assist title. With an assortment of fadeaway jump shots, his favorite one-hand finger-roll and powerful dunks in the low post, he scored 31,419 points, grabbed 23,924 rebounds, averaging 30.07 points (second-best all time behind Michael Jordan) and 22.9 rebounds (all-time leader) and was also very durable, standing on the hardwood an average 45.8 minutes. For his feats, Chamberlain was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, elected one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, ranked #2 in SLAM Magazine's Top 500 NBA Players of all time in 2011 and #13 in ESPN list \\"Top North American athletes of the century\\". In honor of Chamberlain, his jerseys have been retired six times, by Overbrook High School, the University of Kansas, the Harlem Globetrotters, and the Warriors, 76ers and Lakers franchises. List of records and feats Chamberlain holds 72 NBA records, 68 by himself. Among his records are several that are considered unbreakable, such as averaging 22.9 rebounds for a career or 50.4 points per game in a season, scoring 100 points or 55 rebounds in a single game, scoring 65 or more points 15 times, 50 or more points 118 times. During Chamberlain's time, defensive statistics like blocks and steals had not been recorded yet. However, according to Jack Ramsay, \\"Harvey [Pollack] said he used to tell one of his statisticians to keep track of Wilt's blocks in big games ...

The troop's membership generally is drawn from Americans and occasionally foreign nationals attending Bahrain School. The Bahrain School also sponsors a Cub Scout unit for younger boys. In addition to the Bahrain School Cub Scout Pack, there is another BSA Cub Scout unit (Pack 820) that meets on the western side of the island that is unaffiliated with any school. The majority of the membership is American, British, and Filipino. Membership in Pack 820 is open to all nationalities and religions, however the boy must have a working proficiency in English and be a non-Bahraini. Bahraini boys are required to join the local Bahrain Scouts. This information is current as of May 2016. As of 2017, the main BSA troop is Troop 826, part of the BSA Tranzatlantic Council. Troop 826 accepts people of all cultures.  British Scouting Overseas - Bahrain Scout Groups  British Scouting has had a long history of Scouting in the Middle East. In Bahrain, British Scouting organisations have operated from at least the early 1950s with multiple Groups operating previously at different locations. British Scouting Overseas exists to support families around the world where, due to cultural or language barriers (and the fact that people from the UK living overseas may frequently move around), it is not always possible for young people from the UK to join local Scout Groups in the country where they reside. Importantly, existing members of the UK Scout Association who wish to continue their involvement with the Movement while living here in Qatar can do so if they wish. At the time of writing (early 2014) plans are afoot to re-invigorate the 1st Bahrain Scout Group, which is likely to be attached to St Christopher's School.

It lies in the region known as Holstein Switzerland in the municipality of Schönwalde am Bungsberg between Scheelholz and Mönchsneversdorf. The Bungsberg telecommunications tower is located on the Bungsberg. One of the longest rivers in Schleswig-Holstein, the Schwentine, rises on the Bungsberg.  Formation  The Bungsberg is an ice age terminal moraine. Unusually, though, it was formed in the Saale glaciation period about 150,000 years ago. During the subsequent Weichselian glaciation – only about 10,000 years ago – the ice sheet could not cover the hill due to its height, it could only flow around it, and it therefore formed a nunatak.  Leisure and recreation  Signpost to the hill Today the Bungsberg is a very popular viewing point, from which the Baltic Sea may be seen in good weather. An observation tower, the Elisabethturm, was built in 1863 and 1864 on the Bungsberg by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg and, after being increased in height by four metres in 1875, is 22 metres high. It is not open to the public today. As a replacement, a viewing platform was installed halfway up the telecommunications tower on the Bungsberg (see below). In April 2007, the facilities for visitors to the Bungsberg looked rather neglected. The inn was largely demolished and completely fenced off. The observation deck was closed due to vandalism. In late May 2007, after two years of restoration, the tower was re-opened to visitors. Those who climbed the 200 steps to the viewing platform had a unique view in clear weather over large parts of Schleswig- Holstein, and beyond to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Later, the platform was closed again. In winter the Bungsberg is Germany's most northerly skiing area and the only one in Schleswig-HolsteinSpiegel Online, 4 December 2008: Deutschlands nördlichster Skilift - Zwanzig Sekunden im Schneerausch with its own drag lift installed for the few days each year when there is enough snow cover. A downhill run on one of the three pistes lasts about 25 seconds; the lift takes a minute and a half to haul skiers to the top. One piste is for tobogganists and two for skiers or snowboarders. The 300-metre-long downhill piste has a gradient of 17 grad. In the 2009-2010 season up to several hundred people used the slopes daily, some even travelling from Lübeck, Hamburg or Kiel. The 250-metre-long steel cable lift with its 34 zinc pylons can in theory transport up to 600 people an hour to the summit. It was procured in 1970-1971 by the parish of Schönwald am Bungsberg in order to increase tourism. As a result of the weather the lift ran for only one week in 2008-2009 and not at all in 2007-2008.

It deals primarily with the consideration of the effects of random variability upon the performance of an engineering system during the design phase. Typically, these effects are related to quality and reliability. Thus, probabilistic design is a tool that is mostly used in areas that are concerned with quality and reliability. For example, product design, quality control, systems engineering, machine design, civil engineering (particularly useful in limit state design) and manufacturing. It differs from the classical approach to design by assuming a small probability of failure instead of using the safety factor. Designer's perspective Example showing statistical interference of distributions of applied load and strength, resulting in some failures When using a probabilistic approach to design, the designer no longer thinks of each variable as a single value or number. Instead, each variable is viewed as a probability distribution. From this perspective, probabilistic design predicts the flow of variability (or distributions) through a system. By considering this flow, a designer can make adjustments to reduce the flow of random variability, and improve quality. Proponents of the approach contend that many quality problems can be predicted and rectified during the early design stages and at a much reduced cost. The objective of probabilistic design Typically, the goal of probabilistic design is to identify the design that will exhibit the smallest effects of random variability. This could be the one design option out of several that is found to be most robust. Alternatively, it could be the only design option available, but with the optimum combination of input variables and parameters. This second approach is sometimes referred to as robustification, parameter design or design for six sigma Methods used Essentially, probabilistic design focuses upon the prediction of the effects of random variability. Some methods that are used to predict the random variability of an output include: *the Monte Carlo method (including Latin hypercubes); *propagation of error; *design of experiments (DOE) *the method of moments *Statistical interference *quality function deployment *Failure mode and effects analysis See also * Interval finite element Footnotes References * Ang and Tang (2006) Probability Concepts in Engineering: Emphasis on Applications to Civil and Environmental Engineering.

A graduate of the University of Melbourne, where she studied medicine and excelled at sports, Mary qualified as a general practitioner in 1921 and became a resident surgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital. Her work was mainly with poor women, many of whom lived in unsanitary conditions and had inadequate diets. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy. She recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information about what was happening to them, and provided information on birth control at a time when many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. \\"She broke taboos\\", Della Hilton later wrote, and \\"made forbidden subjects not only matters for discussion, but for action\\". In addition to her medical work, Mary supported women's sports and was patron of many charities. During World War II she helped form the AIF Women's Association. She served on its Welfare Subcommittee, looking after the needs of soldiers' families, and was president of the association from 1943 to 1946. In recognition of her medical and charitable work, she was made a Commander of the Order of St John in 1953, and a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1960 \\"for services to nursing in Victoria\\". Early life Mary Ranken Lyle was born in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton on 31 March 1895, the eldest of four children of Sir Thomas Ranken Lyle, a mathematical physicist, and his wife, Frances Isobel Clare née Millear. She attended Toorak College between 1906 and 1912, where she excelled both academically and at sport, playing tennis, hockey, netball and cricket, and competing in swimming. She was head girl in 1911 and 1912. In 1913 she entered the University of Melbourne as a medical student. She was captain of the women's tennis and hockey teams, obtaining University Sporting Blue in both sports. In 1918 she had met Edmund (Ned) Herring, then a young Australian captain in the British Army on leave from the Macedonian front of the Great War. During her training, she worked with the district nurses, visiting families in the Melbourne's less affluent suburbs. Her ambition was to become a doctor who improved the lives of women and children. Women of her own social class did not normally work after they married, so marriage was not something she had intended. In 1919, with the war over, she wrote to Ned urging him to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia. She met her future husband, Ned Herring, when he arrived back in Melbourne at last on 26 November 1920. She graduated with her dual Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MB, BS) degree in March 1921, achieving first-class honours in all subjects, with a first in medicine and fourth in surgery. She won the Keith Levi Memorial Scholarship in medicine and the Sameson Prize in clinical medicine, and became a resident surgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital under Sir Alan Newton. Ned was so supportive of her career plans that Mary reconsidered marriage, although she knew both their parents would disapprove. With her studies completed, Mary and Ned became formally engaged at Easter in 1921, and they were married on 6 April 1922 at Toorak Presbyterian Church. They had three daughters: Mary Cecile (Molly) in 1924, Judith Ann (Judy) in 1926, and Margaret Lyle in 1933. Molly would later become a doctor like her mother. Career Richard Fetherston had established a Baby Health Center in Prahran in 1920 that provided post-natal care. His experience soon showed that his workload would be greatly reduced if ante natal care were provided, with mothers being monitored throughout their pregnancies. He asked Mary if she would be willing to establish such a clinic, which would be open one day a week. The new clinic opened in Prahran, not far from the shopping centre in Chapel Street in 1926. Mary had the district nurses spread word of the clinic. The clinic was the first of its kind in Melbourne, and became a model for a similar clinic established by Mary in South Melbourne in 1940. At the time she started work at the Prahran clinic, she was a mother herself and pregnant with Judy, a circumstance of great interest to the women who sought advice or treatment at the clinic. Her work was mainly with poor women, many of whom lived in unsanitary conditions and had inadequate diets. Mary joined the Melbourne District Nursing Society in 1931 and was its vice president from 1943 to 1953. She banded together with George Simpson and Victor Wallace to establish the Women's Welfare Clinic to offer advice on birth control, at a time when many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. This clinic functioned for one day a week until 1945 when it was discontinued, as the advice it offered could by then be obtained elsewhere. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy, but she recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information about what was happening to them. \\"She broke taboos\\", Della Hilton later wrote, and \\"made forbidden subjects not only matters for discussion, but for action\\". Later life Lady Herring (with hat) looks on as Sir Edmund Herring, the new Chief Justice of Victoria, greets guests at an informal reception in his rooms. Ned joined the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) soon after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, and Mary banded together with a number of soldiers' wives to form the AIF Women's Association in 1940. She served on its Welfare Subcommittee, looking after the needs of soldiers' families, and was president of the association from 1943–46. She became Lady Herring in May 1943 when Ned was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). On 2 February 1944, the Premier of Victoria, Albert Dunstan, appointed Ned as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. For much of the next 30 years he would also serve as lieutenant governor of Victoria, this being a common additional function of the chief justice. When Ned became acting governor for eight months in February 1949, Mary found Government House to be in a state of disrepair. She successfully lobbied James Kennedy for funds for its refurbishment, and supervised the work personally. A foundation member of the Toorak College council in 1927, Mary served as its president from 1947 to 1948 and again from 1960 to 1970. She played tennis and golf, and when her two eldest daughters began playing hockey at school, Mary's interest in hockey was rekindled. A strong believer in the principle that women and not men should administer women's sports, she became a member of the Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council, and was later the patron of the Victorian Women's Hockey Association. Players visiting from interstate would often stay at her home. This was extended to overseas visitors during the 1956 Summer Olympics, which were held in Melbourne. In 1953, Mary travelled to London to attend the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, which she viewed from a seat inside Westminster Abbey. In a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 10 July 1953, the new Queen made Mary a Commander of the Order of St John in recognition of her charity work. Commander of the Order of St John (CStJ). This charity work was extensive. Mary was a foundation member and first president of the Victorian Council of Social Service when it was formed in 1946, and chairman of the Vera Scantlebury Brown Memorial Trust from 1946 to 1979. Mary and Vera Scantlebury Brown had both attended Toorak College and were medical students at the University of Melbourne together. She was a deputy-president of the Victorian division of the Australian Red Cross from 1944 to 1963, of the Victoria League from 1945 to 1972, and of the Australian council of the Save the Children Fund from 1962 to 1967. On 11 June 1960, she was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire \\"for services to nursing in Victoria\\". Mary Herring Hall at Toorak College was named in her honour in 1964. Death Before her death on 26 October 1981, aged 86, following a long illness, Mary planned her own funeral service, requesting that no announcements be made until after she was buried. In her final days, she moved to Ned's nursing home in Camberwell, Victoria, to be with him. A small private service was held on 28 October 1981. She also planned a state funeral at St Paul's Cathedral for Ned, who died a few months after her on 5 January 1982.

Thomas' College Magazine Centenary Issue of College Magazine page 22 editors RD Gunaratne and CS Amaratunge Amaratunga went on to read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at University College, Oxford and was secretary of the Oxford Union. He obtained a doctorate from the University of London for a thesis on Iranian relations with the West in the 1950s. He was interested in politics from his schooldays, and a firm adherent of the United National Party (UNP), the more conservative of the two main Sri Lankan parties. He welcomed its overwhelming victory at the 1977 elections, and its reversal, under Junius Richard Jayewardene, of the statist economic policies of the past. Political career During the early 1980s, Amaratunga believed that Jayewardene was moving towards authoritarianism, and that the open economy he promoted was not sustained by any political philosophy. Amaratunga established the Council for Liberal Democracy, which was intended to develop a conceptual framework for the reforms which he believed should be taken further. Amaratunga broke conclusively with Jayewardene's UNP when it pushed through a referendum in 1982 to postpone parliamentary elections for six years. Apart from the damage to democracy, the measure as Amaratunga predicted led to opposition going underground, and to severe terrorist activity throughout the country in the late eighties. Though Jayewardene's successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, managed to restore order in the south after elections were held, the resentment that had peaked in the north has contributed to continuing conflict with the Tamil Tigers. In 1987, Amaratunga established the Liberal Party of Sri Lanka. The party supported the main opposition candidate for the presidency in 1988. Premadasa began a programme of reforms that brought the country closer to principles Amaratunga had enunciated, in particular a competitive open economy that did not depend on state patronage, an independent judiciary, and regular free elections. Premadasa for his part wooed Amaratunga and had signed a pact with the Liberal Party just before he was assassinated in 1993. Premadasa's successor kept Amaratunga at arm's length, but when he lost the next election Gamini Dissanayake, who took over the leadership of the UNP, in fact got Amaratunga to draft his manifesto for the presidential election of 1994. Dissanayake was also assassinated by the Tigers and though his widow contested the presidency on the manifesto drafted by Amaratunga, his successor as Leader of the Party, who was cast more in the Jayewardene mould, repudiated those principles. The government that had taken over did request Amaratunga's assistance for promotion of its own peace package in the period between 1995 and 1996, but this was not on any formal basis. Amaratunga died in a car crash on 1 August 1996. Writings and interest in the arts Amaratunga crystallised his theories in 'Ideas for Constitutional Reform', based on a seminar series the CLD conducted between 1987 and 1989. Typically, for one who believed in free speech, he included papers by politicians and social commentators representing the whole range of the political spectrum, from the old Trotskyists to modern libertarians. Apart from his interest in politics, Amaratunga was keenly interested in the arts. In the Liberal Review, which he edited along with Rajiva Wijesinha for a decade, there were regular columns on the arts and several reviews that he wrote himself. He was also an accomplished actor, as well as being a debater, and had been Secretary and Treasurer of the Oxford Union.

Career Sällström made her first stage appearance in Hudiksvall at the age of 15, in A Midsummer Night's Dream. She became famous in Sweden in the 1990s, after portraying the teenage girl Victoria Bärnsten in the soap opera Tre kronor. Thereafter, she appeared in numerous productions, and received a Guldbagge Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for the 1997 film Under ytan. Later that same year, unable to cope with her new-found celebrity, she took a break from filming and moved to Copenhagen, where she worked in a café. In 2000, Sällström returned to Sweden to continue her acting career. She did not enjoy the success of previous years until, in 2005, she played the role of detective constable Linda Wallander in the first season of the Swedish TV series Wallander.

Before moving back to Nigeria, Irele was Visiting Professor of African and African American Studies and of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard University.Reviews of his essays, OUP website Faculty page, Harvard University  Early life  Abiola Irele was born in Igbo-Ora, Nigeria, and moved to Enugu very early in his life. His father is from Uokha while his mother is from Ora both in Owan area of Edo State, the first language he learned was Igbo, which he learned from the servants who worked for his father and took care of him growing up. After moving to Lagos in 1940, he began to speak Yoruba. In 1943, after a fight between his parents, Irele returned with his mother to Ora, where he picked up and developed a fluency in the Ora language over the course of a year. However, after returning to Lagos in 1944 to live with his father, he began to predominantly speak Yoruba and maintained it as his ethnic identification. Irele's first encounter with literature was through folk tales and the oral poets who recounted \\"raras\\" in the streets. During the years of his formal education, he began to read more English literature. Education and career Irele graduated from Ibadan University in 1960. Immediately after graduation, he went to Paris to learn French and completed a Ph.D in French at the University of Paris, Sorbonne, in 1966. On his return to Nigeria, he was employed on the Languages Faculty at the University of Lagos, and then at the University of Ghana, Legon.Obi Nwakanma, \\"Tribute: Francis Abiola Irele (1936 – 2017)\\", Vanguard, 16 July 2017.

In his article, Irele defines Négritude as \\"the literary and ideological movement of French-speaking black intellectuals, which took form as a distinctive and significant aspect of the comprehensive reaction of the black man to the colonial situation...\\". In his collection of essays Négritude et condition africaine, Irele explores the question of African thought. He begins by rejecting the notion of ideological difference between anglophone and francophone Africa. He aims to root African progress in the present and not in a romanticized past.

A 1964 plan proposed by a consultant for Prince William County showed a freeway passing by Quantico, Manassas, Leesburg, Poolesville, upper Montgomery County, Fort Meade, southeastern Prince George's County, and La Plata. Most of the route was canceled in the 1980s. Parts of it have been built as the Fairfax County Parkway in Virginia and the Intercounty Connector in Maryland. The Techway is a proposal for a limited-access highway across the Potomac River between Fairfax County, Virginia, and Montgomery County, Maryland. The project's name refers to connecting the high-tech firms in Herndon and Reston, Virginia, with the biotechnology companies in Gaithersburg and Rockville, Maryland. The Techway proposal would construct a limited-access highway and bridge linking Virginia State Route 28 north of Washington Dulles International Airport to the western terminus of I-370 in Gaithersburg, Maryland. To avoid criticism that such a project would encourage urban sprawl, the proponents advocated having very few interchanges on the route and emphasizing its use in making Dulles Airport and the associated office buildings in its vicinity more convenient to residents of northern Montgomery County that currently use the American Legion Memorial Bridge. In 2000, Congress authorized $2,000,000 to conduct a feasibility study of the Techway. Congressman Frank Wolf, one of the primary sponsors of the study, asked that the study be canceled the next year because homes in his Congressional district would have to be destroyed in order to build the Techway. U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta agreed to cancel the study, saying it would be a waste of money to continue studying a bridge that would never be built. Virginia Governor James S. Gilmore III asked Mineta to reconsider, but the study was cancelled. In 2004, a Virginia Department of Transportation traffic study of the American Legion Bridge showed that a significant portion of bridge users traveled between points west of that bridge, reviving the Techway concept. In addition, the Techway project was also discussed in connection with Maryland Route 200 that will extend I-370 to the east to US 1\\\\. The combination of the Techway and this other extension would go a long way to form a Western Bypass of Washington, D.C. for north- south traffic on I-95. Also in 2004, the Montgomery County Council unanimously passed a resolution opposing any bridge, citing concerns about destruction of existing neighborhoods, damage to parkland along the Potomac River, the need to protect the county's Agricultural Reserve, and its conflicting with the master plan for Potomac. As of 2011, the Techway project is not funded and not under active study.

History Caloocan City Science High School stands behind the Division Office along 10th Avenue corner P. Sevilla Street in Grace Park. The school came into existence through Dr. Victoria Q. Fuentes, the Schools Division Superintendent, City Mayor Reynaldo O. Malonzo, and Councilor Edgar R. Erice who saw the need for a science high school for talented students of the city. In July 1998, 360 students of the Department of Science and Technology Special Science Classes from the Caloocan High School were housed on a newly renovated Sangguniang Panglungsod, a three-storey building at the back of the Division Office. The building has eight academic rooms, a library, stockroom two computer rooms, a small guidance office, an audiovisual room where programs are held, the Office of the Principal and a Faculty room. Erice is the sponsor of the Ordinance 0257 Series of 1998 (Proposed Ordinance 0790) \\"An Ordinance Establishing the Caloocan City Science High School to be funded by the Local School Board and the General Fund of the City Government. On October 23, 1998, the Caloocan City Science High School was inaugurated with Malonzo and Fuentes as principal sponsors. On September of the same year, upon the promotion to Assistant Schools Division Superintendent of Lourdes Faustino, the newly appointed Principal Esmilita P. Ulangca and Maria Paz Marcelo, the designated Assistant to the Principal, promulgated the guidelines for the admission of freshmen to CCSHS. Thereafter, a selection test was administered to incoming first year students. To qualify for admission, the applicants should pass the examination, which consists of proficiency tests in English, Science and Mathematics and Logical Reasoning for the first round, and an interview for the second round. A 60%–40% aggregate score of the examinee decides their admission to school. Through the local school board funding, the school was able to acquire science equipment and 50 computers with printers. In 2000 the school ranked first in the Division of Caloocan, 6th in the National Capital Region, and 14th in the National Level in the 2000 National Secondary Aptitude test. In July 2000 the school established its autonomous Student Government with Mary Jane Toledana as the first president and Ferdinand A. de Leon in his capacity as the Coordinator of the Student government. In 2008, the school became an independent an independent high school, thus the school is no longer under the arms of its mother school, Caloocan High School. The announcement was made during the 9th Commencement Exercises, March 27, 2009.

He was also a notable industrial agriculture expert, and president of the Zionist Organization from 1911 to 1921. Biography Otto Warburg was born in Hamburg on 20 July 1859 to a family whose ancestors came to Germany in 1566, possibly from Bologna. He completed his studies at the Johanneum Gymnasium in Hamburg in 1879, and continued his education in the field of botany at the University of Bonn which he left after one semester to move to the University of Berlin, and later to University of Strasbourg, where he received his Ph.D in 1883. He went on to study chemistry in Munich and physiology in Tübingen with Wilhelm Pfeffer. In 1885 he embarked on a 4-year expedition to Southern and Southeastern Asia, ending in Australia in 1889. Warburg's cremated remains were brought to Israel and buried at Kibbutz Degania in 1940.Landscape and Ideology: Reinterment of Renowned Jews in the Land of Israel, Doron Bar Zionism and scientific career In 1911 Warburg was elected president of the Zionist Organization. In 1920 he moved to Palestine and became founding director of the Agricultural Experimental Station in Tel Aviv. It later became the 'Institute of Agriculture and Natural History'. One of his students was Naomi Feinbrun-Dothan. His findings were later (1913–1922) published in three volumes titled Die Pflanzenwelt. Upon his return to Berlin he co founded Der Tropen Pflanzer, a journal specializing in tropical agriculture which he edited for 24 years. Realizing that as a Jew he would not be appointed full professor, he diverted his attentions to applied botanics, and founded several companies of tropical industrial plantations in Germany's colonies. Warburg was also one of the members of the El Arish expedition, appointed by Theodor Herzl as the agricultural member of the team led by Leopold Kessler. in 1931 he founded the National Botanic Garden of Israel in the Hebrew University in Jerusalem on Mount Scopus together with the botanist Alexander Eig. After he retired from his position in Jerusalem, Warburg moved back to Berlin, and died in early 1938. Taxa named include Dovyalis caffra, Virola peruviana, Cephalosphaera usambarensis, and the pitcher plant Nepenthes treubiana. His son, Gustav Otto Warburg, published in 1939 in London the book “Six years of Hitler – The Jews under the Nazi regime”. The extent to which Jews were being actively persecuted in Germany through the 1930s was a hotly debated issue, with many apologists downplaying the centrality of race in Nazi ideology. This book provided a clear counter argument to this position. Based on official German publications and reliable external reports, it details the many methods adopted by the Nazi party against the Jews.

Chaturvedi succeeded P.K.H. Tharakan, a 1968 batch officer of the IPS Kerala cadre who retired on 31 January 2007. Chaturvedi was part of the Indian Police Service (IPS) as a 1970 batch officer from the Madhya Pradesh cadre before joining R&AW;'s own service cadre the Research and Analysis Service (RAS). Chaturvedi, who was an analyst on Bangladesh and Nepal, had also served in the United Kingdom and Canada besides a stint in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.\\"Ashok Chaturvedi to be new RAW chief\\", The Indian Express, 20 January 2007  The V.K. Singh Book Dispute  Controversy and media speculation about his future has also continued to follow Chaturvedi's career with his failed attempts to ban the publication and sale of the book, India's External Intelligence: Secrets of Research and Analysis Wing R&AW;, written by Major General V.K. Singh, formerly a colleague and Joint Secretary in R&AW.; In the book, V.K. Singh made a number of claims about R&AW; including petulant conduct from a senior officer within the organization who went on unauthorised leave for eight months after being overlooked for promotion and who was tagged with malfeasance and ineptitude. The book was published and distributed both in India and abroad in June 2007 and the matter had largely been forgotten.\\"Ban it: RAW responds to critical book by ex-official\\", Indian Express, 15 July 2007 However, Chaturvedi curiously resurrected the issue months later when V.K. Singh's home was raided on 21 September 2007 by officials from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A case was registered against V.K. Singh under the Official Secrets Act of India (OSA). The following day the offices of the publishers of the book, Manas Publications, were also raided.\\"CBI raids ex-RAW officer who wrote book questioning his agency boss\\", Indian Express, 22 September 2007\\"Former Raw official has house raided\\", CNN-IBN, 22 September 2007 Addressing a media conference where former intelligence officials were present to support him, V.K. Singh spectacularly revealed that the R&AW; officer who went on an eight- month leave of absence without permission was in fact Ashok Chaturvedi.\\"RAW writer strikes again\\", The Telegraph, 28 September 2007 Singh said the R&AW; chief's absence from work was \\"an act of gross indiscipline…can he (Chaturvedi) bring discipline to the organization if he does not attend office for eight months?\\" The investigative magazine, Outlook, stated that Chaturvedi appeared to have a personal vendetta against V.K. Singh. They also claimed that sources from the CBI had confirmed to them that the R&AW; officer, mentioned in VK Singh's book, who went on unofficial leave for eight months was indeed Chaturvedi.\\"The Iron Fig Leaf - Outlook scooped V.K. Singh's expose on RAW\\", Outlook Magazine, 8 October 2007 The raid on V.K. Singh's house had also been embarrassing for Chaturvedi as initially the wrong address, belonging to another retired R&AW; official, was raided in East Delhi instead of the author's house in Gurgaon. It took the officials another three hours before they finally reached the correct residence. Ironically, the whole controversy has embarrassed the Indian government and revived the sales of Singh's book. In fact, the publishers ordered another print run of 3,000 copies because of the high demand. The whole incident has also created a new debate over the freedom of expression in India and the level of public accountability of the countries' intelligence agencies. Legal experts also believe it would be a futile attempt to charge V.K. Singh under the Official Secrets Act, particularly as other former intelligence officials have released books that have been deemed to be more damaging in terms of disclosing R&AW;'s secrets, but no action was ever taken against them.\\"Book on India spy agency hits nerve\\", The Los Angeles Times, 2 November 2007\\"CBI raids 'RAW' book publisher\\", NDTV, 22 September 2007 \\"Shooting the Messenger\\", The Pioneer 9 October 2007 Chaturvedi had sanctioned publication of a book written by Shankaran Nair, a former head of R&AW;, in which the Gandhi family, particularly former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, is reported to have been behind a number of controversial deals involving bribery. It has been questioned as to why Chaturvedi tried to gag V.K. Singh yet allowed Nair's book to be published without any scrutiny. This has brought Chaturvedi into a direct confrontation with the Nehru-Gandhi Family.\\"A RAW deal\\", Khaleej Times, 16 December 2007 \\"Spooks 'n Sprouts: An ex-RAW chief lays bare the intrigue- ridden Indira years\\", Outlook Magazine, 19 November 2007 \\"Indira govt paid $11 m, not $6 m, as bribe for Iran loan: ex-official on former RAW Chief's disclosures\\", Indian Express, 14 November 2007 After the V.K. Singh book dispute, Chaturvedi issued a directive wanting all R&AW;'s current employees to sign a declaration that they would not write about their careers after they leave the agency. Opinion, however, is divided on the issue as many say it's unfair to censor such voices. The declaration wants to bar officers from writing about the agency even after the two-year cooling off period post- retirement. The new ruling would mean that officers would have to take permission to write and even then it cannot be published without prior clearance from the agency. The declaration says for any violation the officer will be held \\"liable for action\\", such as no pension, to charges under the Official Secrets Act.\\"Raids on RAW official V K Singh was meant to dissuade others\\", ZEE News, 23 September 2007\\"Ex-RAW spies criticise govt over raid\\", NDTV, 1 October 2007  The Colombo Spy Scandal  In October 2007 another highly damaging controversy erupted for Chaturvedi when it transpired R&AW; was forced to recall one of its officers who was stationed at the Indian High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Ravi Nair, who held the rank of Joint Secretary within R&AW;, was sent back to New Delhi when it transpired that he had developed \\"irregular relations\\" with a Chinese woman. Officials posted at the Indian High Commission, sent reports about Nair to their respective departments paving the way for his recall. What was of particular concern, was that Nair had started the relationship with the same woman during a previous posting to the Indian Consulate in Hong Kong. He apparently continued to maintain ties with her after he was posted to Colombo in 2006.\\"India spy chief recalled for China liaison\\", Radio Australia, 8 October 2007\\"RAW suspects 'Chinese connection' between its officer in Colombo and a woman, calls him back\\", Sunday Express, 7 October 2007 Infighting within R&AW; also may have led to the Nair's recall from Sri Lanka. In fact, Nair's activities had aroused suspicion prior to his posting in Colombo, whilst at the agency's Chennai office when it was alleged he was involved in another extramarital affair. Following reports from the Chennai office, then head of R&AW; P.K.H. Tharakan, directed his second-in-command at the time and the current R&AW; chief Ashok Chaturvedi to conduct an inquiry and take suitable steps. However, Chaturvedi did not take any action and conversely Nair's name was put forward for the Colombo posting, considered one of R&AW;'s most sensitive stations. Outlook Magazine stated that had Chaturvedi conducted an inquiry and taken action at Tharakan's behest, Nair would never have been considered for the posting to Sri Lanka and R&AW; could have saved itself the embarrassment Nair has caused.\\"Infighting in RAW led to officer's recall\\", Sify News, 8 October 2007 The Colombo and Chennai scandals were apparently not Nair's first transgression. At various other foreign postings and travels, several allegations were filed against him in internal R&AW; reports by senior intelligence officers. Prior to his posting in Sri Lanka, Nair had previously been stationed to the United States, Bhutan, Pakistan and Hong Kong but despite all the controversy surrounding him, Nair continued to receive support from Chaturvedi and another former head of R&AW;, Shankaran Nair. Instead of being reprimanded by Chaturvedi, Nair has been allowed to carry on with his duties.\\"Investigation Scandal in RAW\\", Outlook Magazine, 22 October 2007\\"Cover-up games intelligence agencies play\\", The Times of India, 9 October 2007\\"India recalls RAW official from Sri Lanka\\", Hindustan Times, 7 October 2007  The Indian Intelligence Failure  In December 2007, it was revealed that there had been a massive intelligence failure inside R&AW.; It was in relation to the state of emergency declared by the President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf. Apparently, just days before Musharraf installed emergency rule, Chaturvedi had advised the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, that the situation in Pakistan was stable and that there was no chance that Musharraf would declare martial law. Not anticipating any major change in Pakistan, Chaturvedi did not feel the need to prepare for any unpredictable change in circumstances. On 3 November 2007, Musharraf suspended the constitution and declared a state of emergency. New Delhi was caught completely off guard and the Indian prime minister apparently \\"was livid.\\"  The Nepal Exposure  Unlike his predecessors who specialised in Pakistan or China, Chaturvedi is the first head of India's Intelligence agency whose area of expertise is Nepal. However, in December 2007 the R&AW; Chief faced another embarrassing scandal when the 'Nepal Weekly' magazine revealed that R&AW; was trying to interfere in the internal political dynamics of Nepal. The magazine also revealed the names of various R&AW; agents working at the Indian embassy in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu which included Suresh Dhundiya, R&AW;'s station chief in Kathmandu, and his deputies Alok Tiwari posted as First Secretary (Education) and K. V. Johri, a counsellor. It was also publicized that Dhundiya was being replaced as station chief by Alok Joshi. This revelation resulted in Joshi being exposed before he even assumed his new position thus compromising R&AW;'s intelligence apparatus in Nepal. To make matters worse, Nepalese newspapers were also able to find out the detailed travel plans of Chaturvedi's visit to Nepal in December 2007, including the airline he flew on and which hotel he stayed in.\\"Mysterious visit of RAW chief and its impact\\", Telegraph Nepal, 22 December 2007\\"Ties with Nepal hit as Maoists call the shots\\", Khaleej Times, 9 December 2007 Chaturvedi forced the interim government of Girija Prasad Koirala to award a contract to an Indian firm for a hydropower project. It has also been alleged that Chaturvedi may have financially benefited personally from the deal. Questions have been raised in India as to why the head of an Indian intelligence agency was promoting a commercial company in Nepal.“Gaffes, mismanagement – RAW chief on his way out”, The Daily Times, 23 February 2008 The timing of these events coincided with worsening relations between India and Nepal. In a snub to India, Nepal's Foreign Minister Sahana Pradhan requested a high level Chinese delegation visiting Kathmandu to extend the Tibet rail into Nepal. The request carries significance against the backdrop of Nepal's warning to India not to go ahead with a proposed highway along the India-Nepal border. The Telegraph Weekly of Nepal commented that \\"With R&AW; facing continuous debacle in its Nepal affairs, it is highly likely that the R&AW; machinery will come in a heavy way in order to regain its lost ground in Nepal. Chaturvedi is being told to pack up by the New Delhi set-up, it is talked\\".  Diplomatic Faux Pas  In a number of important meetings, Chaturvedi did not appear to know who he was actually meeting. On one particular occasion, Timothy J. Keating, the commander of the United States Pacific Command made an official trip to India in August 2007 and met a number of senior Indian defense and intelligence chiefs including Chaturvedi. However, Chaturvedi did not know who Keating was, and kept referring to him as John Negroponte, the U.S. deputy Secretary of State. In another episode, before leaving on a trip to China in January, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asked Chaturvedi for a briefing about his perspectives of the current senior leadership in China. Instead of delegating the task to the China section within R&AW;, Chaturvedi attempted to put together his own report which talked about Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, the former president and premier respectively, both of whom retired in 2003.\\"R&AW; in for a shake-up?”, The Hindustan Times, 21 February 2008  Government Sanctions Dismissal  Because of the repeated instances of incompetence and scandals during Chaturvedi's tenure and the continuing decline of the intelligence agency, it had been reported by the Indian and foreign press that the R&AW; chief would be removed from his post, which has never happened before.“Exclusive Raw Corruption Probe”, Outlook Magazine, 28 January 2008“It’s spy vs spy now”, Asian Age, 3 March 2008 It was reported that several Western intelligence agencies were reluctant to share classified information with R&AW;'s top officials, because of Chaturvedi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other senior officials of his secretariat were unhappy with him as a result. The Middle East Times revealed that at a closed-door meeting at the start of 2008 which all of India's intelligence and military chiefs were present, Chaturvedi was asked for his opinion on the upcoming security challenges the country faced. The R&AW; chief presented his views while chewing tobacco and sounding incoherent. Narayanan asked him to clean out his mouth. But \\"Embarrassment turned to humiliation when Chaturvedi resumed his analysis only to be told by Narayanan that he was making more sense when the tobacco was in his mouth.\\"“India's spy chief controversy continues”, Middle East Times, 29 May 2008 The pressure to sack him on the grounds of gross incompetence had reached Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who supported by senior leaders in the ruling Congress Party, gave his approval to quietly remove Chaturvedi. Chaturvedi made a direct personal appeal to Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi to save his job, claiming that he was not in good health and that he should be allowed to serve out the remainder of his service period. Gandhi, passed the responsibility for the decision to Narayanan with her recommendation for a review. Narayanan deferred making any decision thus reprieving Chaturvedi. G.S. Bajpai, a former head of R&AW; and Tripathi's father-in law, also intervened and pleaded the case to keep Chaturvedi when it looked like he would be sacked. Quoting sources from the Prime Minister's Office, the Middle East Times claimed that \\"The Congress Party was worried that if Chaturvedi was sacked it would be a sign of admitting that they had made a mistake.\\" Criticism has focused on Narayanan himself, who despite being a respected figure within India for his record with the domestic spy agency, the Intelligence Bureau (IB), he has had to take criticism for sanctioning Chaturvedi's appointment and continuing in persisting with him. Unsanctioned Post-Retirement Perks In the 8 February 2010 edition of Outlook Magazine it was reported that following his retirement, Chaturvedi had a diplomatic passport issued for himself and his wife and was able to utilize Government of India funds for their personal international trips. According to Outlook Magazine, \\"Only grade ‘A’ ambassadors—usually IFS (Indian Foreign Service) officers posted in key countries like the UK and US—are allowed to hold diplomatic passports after retirement. The majority, who do not fit that bill, hold passports issued to ordinary citizens. In fact, all former R&AW; chiefs Outlook spoke to confirmed they had surrendered their diplomatic passports the day they retired. And their spouses weren’t entitled to diplomatic passports even while they were in service.\\"Outlook reports on RAW corruption: http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?264027 References Category:Indian police officers Category:Spymasters Category:Indian spies Category:Living people Category:1947 births Category:People of the Research and Analysis Wing ","title":"Ashok Chaturvedi"},{"id":"9499962","text":"Robert Arthur (Bob) Roseveare (23 May 1923 – 8 December 2004) was an English codebreaker at Bletchley Park during World War II and later a schoolteacher. He was born at Repton, Derbyshire where his father, Sir Martin Roseveare, taught at Repton School. He won a scholarship to Marlborough College, Wiltshire, where he studied from 1936 to 1941. In 1942 Roseveare and fellow Marlborough student Nigel Forward were recruited by Gordon Welchman (who also went to Marlborough College) for Hut 6 at Bletchley Park where they worked on German Air Force (Luftwaffe) Enigma messages. Roseveare started in the Watch, then moved to the Quatch, a small backroom group that decoded non-current messages. When Germany surrendered, Bob moved to the Japanese section, until August 1945. Roseveare met his future wife in Hut 6, Ione Jay, full name Katherine Ione Jay. They married on August 7, 1947, with Derek Taunt as best man. His friend from Marlborough, Nigel Forward, Dennis Babbage and three others in Hut 6 also met their wives there. After leaving Bletchley Park, Roseveare took up a scholarship he had won in 1941 to St John's College, Cambridge, and was awarded a degree in mathematics in 1947. In 1948 while touring South Africa and Rhodesia with a mixed Oxford and Cambridge hockey team he accepted a teaching post at Hilton College, Natal. He moved to Michaelhouse, Natal, then St Martin’s School, Johannesburg, then to a multiracial school at Waterford, Swaziland. He was licensed by the Archbishop of Cape Town as a lay reader. He returned to England in 1965, where he taught at Epsom College, then (1970–1983) at Uppingham School, Rutland, becoming the head of the Mathematics department in 1980. After retiring in 1983 he taught at the Haberdashers’ Monmouth School for Girls for a year. He was keen on the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, and on the history of the Rosevear (also spelled Roseveare or Rosevere) family from Cornwall, England, starting about AD 1500 in the hamlet of Rescorla near Luxulyan. Between 1985 and 1990 Bob published seven booklets on the Roseveare family, which have been updated and reissued as one book, with information on 14,779 descendants throughout the world. His sister Helen Roseveare was a medical missionary in the Congo for 20 years. He died aged 81 at Uppingham on 8 December 2004.

Aderpul came to public notice in 1529 in the Klützer Ort, a district between Wismar and Lübeck, which was on Mecklenburg territory but fell within the Bishopric of Ratzeburg, and was mostly owned by the von Plessen family who had built up considerable debts to the diocese. They saw the Reformation as an opportunity to evade their financial obligations. Appointments to livings on estates were generally made by the lord of the manor with the approval of the diocesan bishop. Bernd von Plessen deliberately provoked the Bishop of Ratzeburg, Georg von Blumenthal, by dismissing the two Catholic incumbents of the parish of Gressow, which was on his estates, one of them on the non-theological grounds that he only had one eye, and to replace them with Aderpuhl, who was already married, as the pastor. The church bureaucracy was slow to react, but eventually on 20 December the Cathedral Provost Mus reported this irregularity to the Bishop. The latter complained to the Duke of Mecklenburg, reporting his letter that early in December 1529 Aderpul had preached that “All things above, below and in the earth, wood, water, meadow and game, should be held equally in common and belong to no-one in particular.” Next day the Bishop had him seized in a night raid and locked up in the dungeon of his splendid official residence at Schönberg. When Bernd von Plessen demanded his release, the Bishop replied that the preacher was a knave and a trickster, that he knew perfectly well how to handle preachers, that he recognized only the higher authority of the Pope, and that the von Plessens had not even bothered to write to him in advance of making the appointment. Bernd von Plessen also complained to Duke Henry of Mecklenburg, arguing that Gressow was outside the Bishop’s jurisdiction and that the arrest was an act of war on Mecklenburg. The Duke tried to intercede on Aderpuhl’s behalf, and an angry correspondence about jurisdiction ensued. Bishop Georg von Blumenthal When the von Plessens’ separate official letter of complaint to the Bishop was delivered, he showed it to his Castellan Bernd von Rohr and said: \\"Was sollen die Klützörter tun! Wenn es eine gute große Kanne Bier wäre, so wären die Klützeorter gute Nachbarn dazu, sie söffen sie wohl aus” (What do you expect of the Klützer Ort people? If there had been a good big pin of beer, they would have been excellent neighbours to it and drunk it dry.) To which the castellan replied: \\"Gnädiger Herr, die Gesellen, die die große Kanne Bier wohl aussaufen können, die lassen sich auch wohl finden und halten, was sie zusagen.\\" (My gracious Lord, our friends who can drain the pin of beer will let themselves be traced, and we will hold them to their promise). As the Bishop would not budge, the following morning Bernd von Plessen got his brothers and relatives together and took matters into his own hands. With the exception of the von Bernstorfs, the von Plessens gathered together the entire nobility of the Klützer Ort. On Boxing Day 1529 the armed cavalcade – 100 knights and many men-at-arms, marched up to the castle gates where the bishop was lodged, with his prisoner in the dungeon below. They demanded entry with a fanfare of trumpeters and were answered with three gunshots. Bernd von Plessen's men rampaged through Bünstorf, Blüssen, Rodenberg, Rüschenbek, and Papenhusen. All were looted, women in childbed were hauled out of bed and robbed of their bedlinen. In Blüssen they broke into the chapel, got out the church vestments and mocked them, and wounded the Bishop’s Vicar. Between them they stole 251 horses, 279 head of cattle, 465 sheep and 32 swine. Within ten days the Bishop was putting his case before the high court at Mecklenburg. The records of the case show who took part in this rampage. There were thirteen von Plessens, Eggert von Quitzow and his three sons from Vogtshagen; five von Bülows; and nobles from the von Negendank, von der Brook, von Booth, von Schosse, von Passewitz, von Scharfenbereg, von Warnstedt, von Dambek, von Lützow, von Strahlendorf and von Bibow families. Most of these were locals, but some came from farther afield and one or two, notably Melchior von Warnstedt, even from the Bishop’s native Prignitz. The Duke of Mecklenburg ordered the von Plessens to keep the peace, but as this did not satisfy the Bishop he kept Aderpul locked up for a further year in Schönberg, when he was released with the remark that he had forever made himself an enemy in his domains. He ended his days as a Lutheran parish priest in Bützow.  References  * Gottlieb Matthias Carl Masch: Geschichte des Bisthums Ratzeburg. F.

He was the Chair of the Finance Committee in the Northern Irish Assembly from 2012 to 2016 and a Sinn Féin MLA for North Antrim for 9 years. He successfully brought forward legislation that led to the introduction of a Carrier Bag Levy in Northern Ireland and the abolishment of rates for hundreds of Community Amateur Sport Clubs (CASCs). In 2016 he began working as a political columnist and commentator with the Belfast Telegraph, BBC and ITV. He currently works in advocacy and public affairs. Background McKay pictured with ISM group operating in Tulkarm, West Bank in August 2004 McKay was born in Ballymena in 1982 and raised in Rasharkin, County Antrim. Prior to being elected he was involved in aid work in the Palestinian West Bank where he worked with the International Solidarity Movement accompanying Palestinians to help minimise harassment and attacks from the IDF and Israeli settlers. Whilst there he and his group were present at the scene of the killing of two Palestinians by the Israeli Defence Forces in Tulkarm. Elected office He was elected to Ballymoney Council in 2005 becoming the first nationalist councillor from Rasharkin ever to be elected. Daithí was the youngest ever member of Ballymoney Borough Council. In 2007, McKay contested the North Antrim seat in the Northern Ireland legislature. He went on to claim his seat after the first count, coming second behind Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). McKay received 7,065 votes to Paisley's 7,716. Paisley's son, Ian Paisley Jr. came in third. This is the closest anyone ever came to beating Ian Paisley in an election. McKay was the youngest Member elected to the 2007 Assembly and he became one of the first Sinn Féin members to sit on the Policing Board along with Martina Anderson and Alex Maskey. In September 2007 McKay sparked off a political scandal in the Assembly when he used parliamentary privilege to name private developer Seymour Sweeney as a member of the DUP. The DUP Environment Minister, Arlene Foster, had said that she was 'minded' to approve an application from Sweeney for a private visitor centre at the Giant's Causeway, even though her Planning Service officials had recommended that it be refused. Foster threatened to take McKay to court over the matter but in January 2008 she decided to refuse the private application. Attacks and threats In June 2003 McKay was one of a group of Sinn Féin members, including Martin McGuinness and Philip McGuigan, attacked by a loyalist mob in Ballymoney. McGuinness said that \\"some of them tried to break the windows of the car with their fists, and it was quite a dangerous situation. I think if they had gained access into the car, it could have been quite a nasty situation.\\" In June 2008, he was one of four Sinn Féin councillors in north Antrim who reportedly received death threats. In July 2008, McKay and fellow Sinn Féin member Cllr Padraig McShane sustained minor injuries in a dispute with local youths in Ballymena. The dispute arose because of the youths' opposition to the removal of a bonfire to commemorate internment (Operation Demetrius). McKay said they were in the area \\"in opposition to criminal and antisocial elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities\\". The incident was captured by a BBC camera crew. In May 2009 there were a series of attacks on property in Rasharkin, including an attack on McKay's house and a cafe in the village. The North Antrim MLA blamed anti-social elements and said that these people would not deter him from his work. A bomb threat was phoned through to McKay's Sinn Féin office in January 2015. The caller claimed that a bomb had been left outside McKay's home but police later declared this a hoax after searches took place at his property. Rasharkin parades Daithi McKay at a protest in Rasharkin in 2011 McKay was involved in protests against the Ballymaconnelly parade through the mainly nationalist village of Rasharkin since they began in 2004.Rasharkin residents could take legal action over paradeBelfast Telegraph100 Protest At Rasharkin ParadeBallymoney Times In 2010 the parade was restricted and for the first time was only allowed to march the Main Street on the outward parade but not return. In 2012 two men were fined by a court after McKay reported them for posting sectarian messages on Facebook relating to the village. One of the accused was alleged to have posted: \\"Let's show the scum in Rasharkin (a Co Antrim village where many Catholics live) how it is done.\\" \\"God save the Queen. For God and Ulster, Kill all taigs. Lest we forget.\\" In 2012 representation from McKay and others in the Rasharkin Residents Association helped secure a determination from the Parades Commission that the parade be reduced from 44 to 25 bands. He highlighted UVF & UDA paramilitary displays at the parade & in 2015 the Parades Commission introduced a flags ban on the parade. Carrier Bag Levy In 2011 McKay introduced the \\"Single Use Plastic Bag Bill\\" which eventually was passed by the Assembly as the \\"Single Use Carrier Bag Act 2011\\". He had raised the matter through a Private Members Debate previously and is believed to be responsible for Sinn Féin ensuring that the levy was included in the Executive's Budget in 2010. The Act amended part of the Climate Change Act 2008. The 5 pence levy was introduced in April 2013 and the bill also ensured that the proceeds went towards environmental and community projects. It has resulted in the reduction in usage of carrier bags in Northern Ireland by tens of millions annually. He remains the only Sinn Féin MLA to have successfully passed a Private Members Bill in the Assembly. The SpAd Bill In 2013 McKay led the opposition to the Special Advisers Bill brought forward by TUV leader Jim Allister. The Bill aimed to dis-bar ex-prisoners from being Special Advisors to Ministers in the Executive. During the closing debate in which Allister's Bill was ultimately passed McKay made a \\"marathon 2-hour speech\\" in opposition. This remains the longest speech ever made by an MLA in the Assembly. Campaign to abolish rates for Sport Clubs Consultation Paper to abolish rates for amateur sport clubs In 2013 Daithí McKay started a campaign to abolish rates for sport clubs. In his second piece of legislation he proposed that CASCs (Community Amateur Sport Clubs) should have 100% rate relief on their grounds and facilities. In the Bill consultation he received over 1,000 responses, one of the most successful consultations for an Assembly Bill to date. He secured the support of the majority of MLAs but the DUP blocked the bill controversially using the Petition of Concern. The campaign still proved successful with the Department of Finance subsequently committing to grant 100% rate relief for clubs as long as they did not have licensed bars. A proposal put by McKay to the Assembly was also passed that ensured that the Department had to have regulations in place by the end of September 2016. On 26 October 2016 full relief for CASCs without bars was introduced by the Finance Minister. Campaign for equal marriage McKay was a strong supporter of LGBT rights in the Assembly. He spoke in debates to extend marriage to same sex couples between 2012 and 2016 and jointly tabled a number of the motions put to the Assembly. In April 2014 speaking to a motion that he tabled along with 5 other members he said that \\"Homophobia is fuelling the political representation in much of the debate here today. This is about gay people being treated as less than everyone else. Gay men and women are deserving of the same rights that I have and of the same rights that you have. \\"Two people who love each other and who have their love recognised through marriage pose no threat to anybody.\\" He was one of 3 Sinn Féin MLAs to table a motion calling for equal marriage to be introduced in April 2015 and it was defeated by 49 votes to 47. In November 2015 he again was one of 6 MLAs that tabled a motion calling on the Executive \\"to table legislation to allow for same sex marriage.\\" 53 MLAs supported the motion and 52 opposed. It was the first time that a majority of Assembly members had expressed support for marriage to be extended to same sex couples. He has remained a vocal supporter of LGBTI rights since he left the Assembly. Resignation On 13 July 2016 McKay called on the Parades Commission to bar Dervock Young Defenders band from partaking in parades in sensitive areas following an incident in Ballycastle. After McKay made a presentation to the commission with members of the Rasharkin Residents Association the band were barred from participating in the Ballymaconnelly parade in August. It was alleged that after this parade decision was made the loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson leaked details of messages he exchanged with McKay in which McKay allegedly refers Bryson to a third party whilst he chaired the NAMA Enquiry in the Assembly. The First Minister Peter Robinson resigned less than 2 months after Bryson made allegations at the Finance Committee and McKay was accused of helping to 'take out' the First Minister that was in office with his party colleague Martin McGuinness at the time. McKay resigned as an MLA on 18 August 2016. Columnist and writer McKay began writing for the Belfast Telegraph and the political blog Slugger O'Toole in December 2016. He also began working as a commentator on BBC and ITV. In his first article he called on mainly nationalist councils to introduce the flying of the tricolour from government buildings in the north for the first time by adopting a flags policy of equality rather than neutrality. McKay believes that the mandatory coalition system that puts parties in power automatically is flawed. He has called for Assembly reform. A suggestion he has put forward for discussion is that a hybrid model of a weighted majority system retaining some cross-community safeguards would help address political 'gridlock'. After the Assembly collapsed over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal in early 2017 McKay said that the Irish Language Act, unimplemented since the St Andrew's Agreement, should be agreed before the institutions are restored. In July 2017 he described the Eleventh night as similar to the film The Purge, where all laws are suspended for one night a year and people allowed to do whatever they want, with no consequences. In August 2017 he criticised the DUP MLA Jim Wells after the South Down man resigned from the National Trust due to their participation in Belfast Pride parade.

While Jundallah claimed responsibility, the Iranian government has accused the governments of United States of complicity. The first bombing occurred at 6:30 a.m. on February 14 when a car filled with explosives stopped in front of a bus carrying Revolutionary Guards in Ahmadabad district. The car exploded, killing 18 and injuring 31 members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. First bombing A car filled with explosives stopped in front of a bus full of Revolutionary Guards in Ahmadabad district, Zahedan, Sistan-Baluchestan Province at 6:30 a.m. on 14 February 2007. The car, parked in the middle of the road, forced the bus to stop. The car's driver and passengers then got out of the car and used motorbikes to leave the scene while they shot at the bus. A few seconds later the bombs exploded, killing 18 Guards. A number of Zahedan residents demonstrated in the streets, holding the coffins of the victims of the first bombing, chanting \\"death to hypocrites.\\" Guards commander Qasem Rezaei said, \\"This blind terrorist operation led to the martyrdom of 18 citizens of Zahedan.\\" Rezaei attributed the attack to \\"insurgents and elements of insecurity.\\" Majid Razavi, an Interior Ministry official, said Iranian police arrested a suspect within an hour of the bombing. Five days later, the authorities announced the execution of Nasrollah Shanbezehi. He was hanged in public at the site of the bombing. He was said to have been tried and sentenced by a branch of the Revolutionary Court after his televised confession. In one of the pictures of his execution, where the noose is being placed around his neck, a bruise is clearly visible above his right eye. In his confession, he reportedly said that he had joined PRMI\\\\Jundallah three months previously, solely for financial reward, but other sources say that he was arrested because he was taking a picture of the bus with his mobile phone. Jundallah claimed responsibility for the attack on 15 February. The Iranian government has arrested five suspects, two of whom were carrying camcorders and grenades when they were arrested, while the police killed the main \\"agent\\" of the attack. Among the arrestees was Said Qanbarzehi, a Balochi, who was hanged in Zahedan prison on 27 May 2007. He had been sentenced to death at the age of 17 along with six other Balochi men—Javad Naroui, Masoud Nosratzehi, Houshang Shahnavazi, Yahya Sohrabzehi, Ali Reza Brahoui and Abdalbek Kahrazehi (also known as Abdalmalek) – in March 2007, despite the absolute international prohibition on the execution of child offenders. Balochi sources suggest that the seven may have been arrested because of their family ties to those suspected of involvement in the February bus bombing. According to Sistan- Baluchistan Provincial Television, 15–17 March 2007, Said Qanbarzehi and the six others all confessed to a number of crimes that allegedly took place in Sistan-Baluchistan province. Some reports suggest that those who confessed were tortured, including by having bones in their hands and feet broken, by being “\\"branded”\\" with a red-hot iron, and by having an electric drill applied to their limbs, shredding their muscles. Following publication of an interview in ‘Ayyaran newspaper, which has since been closed down on the order of Hojjatoleslam Nekunam, on 17 March 2007 Hossein Ali Shahriari (Zahedan's representative in parliament), stated that there were around 700 people awaiting execution in Sistan-Baluchistan province, whose sentences had been confirmed by the Supreme Court. =Reaction= Brigadier General Mohammad Jaffari said on 15 February that the government had arrested 68 people in connection with the bombing. The spokesman for Javier Solana, the Secretary- General of the Council of the European Union, said, \\"We condemn the car bomb attack on Wednesday in Zahedan. Acts of terrorism can never be justified. The perpetrators must be brought to justice. We extend our condolences to the loved ones of the victims and to the Iranian government.\\" The United Nations Security Council condemned the bombing through a press statement, saying that nothing justifies terrorism. Peter Burian, Slovakia's ambassador to the United Nations and President of the Security Council, said, \\"They underlined the need to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of this terrorist attack, as with all terrorist attacks.\\" United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon condemned the attack and gave his condolences to the Iranian government and the families of the victims. The Georgian Foreign Ministry also condemned the bombing. Second bombing Jundallah militants set off a percussion bomb in a girls school on 17 February shortly after the funeral for those killed in the first bombing. Hasan Ali Nouri, governor of Zahedan, said the bomb was a \\"sound bomb explosion.\\" It wounded one person. Militants then shot at an electricity plant, successfully cutting off power, before fleeing to a house in Zahedan. Fars news agency, which is an Iranian state run agency, reported \\"The insurgents began shooting at people after the explosion. Clashes are continuing between police and the armed insurgents. Police have cordoned off the area.\\" The Iranian government summoned Pakistani ambassador Shafkat Saeed. Foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said, \\"The Pakistani ambassador was summoned to the foreign ministry to give explanations. Discussions were undertaken and a committee was formed between the two countries to reinforce border security.\\" The investigation and the confessions show that foreigners are implicated in these actions.

The mudslide started at the edge of the Babi Yar mass murder site and dumped mud, water, and human remains into the streets of Kyiv. The Soviet authorities suppressed information about the disaster, and claimed 145 people were killed, while forbidding any memorial events for the victims. A 2012 study in Ukraine estimates that the number of victims was closer to 1,500. Disaster The mudslide started when a dam securing the loam pulp dump of a brick factory near the Babi Yar mass murder site collapsed after rain, releasing large volumes of pulp sludge, mud, water, and human remains down the steep hill of the modern Olena Teliha Street and into the streets of Kyiv. The slide immediately hit the lower-lying Kurenivka neighbourhood, including a residential area, a tram depot, several industrial buildings and a cemetery, as well as cars and trams on its way. The total volume of pulp in the vicinity of Kyrylivska - Novokostiantynivska streets was up to 600 thousand m³ with a depth of up to 4 m. The official report indicated 145 fatalities, while a recent study estimates 1,500. Recovery operations Recovery operations continued for days, but no official notification of the tragedy was ever published by the Soviet authorities. Recovery operations were led by the 120 Detached Engineering Battalion and the Anti-gas Regiment of the Local Anti-Aircraft Defence troops of the Soviet Army in the Kyiv Military District, led by the Hero of the Soviet Union Ivan Kharchenko. The events in Kurenivka were strictly censored by the Soviet Government. In order to cover up the scale of this disaster, many of the people who died were buried in different cemeteries in Kyiv and its nearby towns with different dates and reasons for their death in the government records. No public remembrance activities were allowed and Soviet troops were sent to clear all visible consequences of the disaster. Aftermath Kyiv Kurenivka Mudslide MonumentAs a result of the subsequent investigation, several construction engineers and managers responsible for the dam’s design and maintenance were accused of negligence and convicted. In 1962, Ukrainian Communist Party leaders ordered the leveling of the Babi Yar ravine and the establishment of a park on the site where at least 33,000 Jews from Kyiv and surrounding areas had been shot to death in 1941 by the Einsatzgruppen.

Remake Mines of Titan is a remake, or update, of the Commodore 64 game Mars Saga. Mines of Titan is lengthier, with some new storylines, a few more creatures and a few details like colors are different. And of course the game's location is moved from Mars to Titan. The cities and maps look the same. Plot Mines of Titan is set in the year 2261, well into the era of mankind's colonization the inner Solar System. The game takes place on a barely terraformed Titan, the largest moon of the gas giant Saturn, at the edge of frontier space. The player character is a charismatic 22-year-old astronaut Tom Jetland, who has crashed on Titan after bullet-sized rocks from the Rings of Saturn pierced his ship's hull. Forced to eject payload and has no means of transport off the world. In order to raise money, Jetland must search for, recruit, create and control a party of characters ready for exploration and combat. The player develops Jetland and other characters by improving their natural attributes and by adding and training in over twenty new skills which will aid in both the central quest and various side missions. Success depends upon competence in battle with various creatures and human foes alike; exploration of underground colonies and mining settlements; using characters' skills to their best advantage; utilising a wide array of weaponry and aid acquired from merchants; and most importantly tracking down the clues to solve the mysteries of Titan. For only by uncovering a vast conspiracy and learning the fate of the disappeared Proscenium Colony (presumably named after the Proscenium \\"archway\\" of a theatrical stage) will the player be able to raise enough credits to pay for safe passage off Titan. Feelies Infocom often released their games with merchandise referred to as feelies. Mines of Titan originally came on floppy disc format which was provided in a secret agent-style packaging, which also contained a thirty-seven page manual and various paraphernalia, such as a \\"command reference card\\"; supposedly secret classified military and scientific documents; weapons schematics; illustrations of alien lifeforms; and hidden maps, all connected with the game. The more expensive game packages had small figurines. These box sets are now extremely rare. Reception The game was reviewed in 1990 in Dragon #154 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. In 2006, abandonware website Abandonias Romano reviewed Mines of Titan with \\"I am kind of disappointed in the game – the sinister, futuristic setting could have made up a great game, but the developers wasted all their work because of some major downgrades like the battle system and lack of sound.\\" References External links * *Mines of Titan at GameSpot Category:1989 video games Category:Apple II games Category:DOS games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video game remakes Category:Westwood Studios games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set on Titan (moon) ","title":"Mines of Titan"},{"id":"9500192","text":"Northmen or Norsemen are the group of people as a whole who speak one of the North Germanic languages as their native language.

It is one of the causative agents of Dutch elm disease. It was first described under the name Graphium ulmi, and later transferred to the genus Ophiostoma. Dutch elm disease originated in Europe in the early 1900s.Clinton, G. P., McCormick, Florence A., Dutch elm disease, Graphium ulmi; New Haven, 1936 Elm trees were once an ecologically valuable tree that dominated mixed broadleaf forests, floodplains, and low areas near rivers and streams. They were planted in urban settings because of their aesthetic appeal and their ability to provide shade due to their V like shape. An outbreak of Dutch elm disease in the 1920s and again in the 1970s was responsible for the death of more than 40 million American elm trees. Ophiostoma ulmi was the first known cause of Dutch elm disease . Since its discovery in 1910, new forms of the fungus, specifically Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, have emerged and appear to be more resistant to control measures and more aggressive in their infection. Host range and symptoms Ophiostoma ulmi has a relatively narrow host range as it infects only elm trees (Ulmus spp.) and Zelkova carpinifolia. Habitat preferences of elms play a large part in determining their susceptibility as a host for Dutch elm disease. For example, of the three native European elm species (Ulmus glabra Huds., Ulmus laevis Pall. and Ulmus minor), all are susceptible to infection by O. ulmi, but Ulmus glabra has a much smaller chance of being inoculated than Ulmus minor. This is because the insect vector prefers the warm humid habitat of Ulmus minor to the cold hemiboreal habitat of Ulmus glabra. For this reason, Ulmus minor has been almost completely eliminated by the disease. In North America, Ulmus americana, U. thomasii, U. alata, U. serotina and U. rubra are listed as highly susceptible to Dutch Elm disease, while U. crassifolia is less threatened. Ophiostoma ulmi causes symptoms commonly associated with most vascular wilts. Trees that have been infected by a vector will exhibit symptoms of leaf wilting and yellowing on branches and twigs that have been colonized by the Scolytid beetle. These symptoms are most often apparent from July into the autumn months. Trees that have contracted the disease via root grafts will often proceed much more quickly because the whole tree is compromised at once. Diagnosis of this disease is usually done by examining the xylem tissue of twigs and branches of the trees. Symptoms of brown streaking that runs in the direction of the grain of the wood, and tylosis formation by the tree as a reaction to the fungal infection are characteristic of this disease. Breeding efforts began as early as the 1920s to try to combat this disease, and some crosses bred from resistant Asian species of elm and susceptible European species have shown a decrease in susceptibility to the pathogen. However, with the introduction of Ophiostoma novo-ulmi many of these resistant species struggle to survive. Environment Ophiostoma ulmi infects the bark and xylem tissue of elm trees. It has been found in northern Africa and Oceania, but the vast majority of elms that are or have been colonized by O. ulmi can be found in Europe, west central Asia, and North America. While there is some speculation about how the disease traveled to North America, most experts agree that it was the fault of humans. In the spring, trees produce what is known as “springwood” from the stored starches of the previous growing season. This tissue is characterized by long xylem vessels with relatively thin walls, making it the ideal habitat for the pathogen. In springwood, the fungus spreads rapidly, and it is likely that the tree will die. Later in the growing season, the elm will utilize sugars produced by the leaves to nurture the formation of “summerwood”. Summerwood vessels are typically shorter with thicker walls, making it harder for the infection to spread. The pathogen enters its host with assistance from the Scolytid beetle, and will colonize the tunnels, or breeding galleries, made by the insect. The greatest impact of this disease is seen in urban settings and in trees that have previously been impaired by drought or insects. O. ulmi prefers a subtropical climate for sporulation, with optimal temperatures between 27.5℃ and 30℃ and high moisture, which has largely limited the pathogen’s reach in high altitudes and northern latitudes. The formation of other structures can tolerate cooler environments. Conidia will form at or around 20℃, while perithecia form at 8-10°C. Subjection to high summer temperatures combined with low moisture content and ensuing low nutrient levels in the bark of elm trees greatly restricts sporulation of the fungi. Because of this, it is common for the fungus to avoid branches with small diameters and localize in areas with thick bark, high moisture, and abundant nutrients. Chemical control of this disease through insecticides and fungicides has not proven successful in the past and is often expensive. Many communities have adopted cultural practices to help manage the spread of this disease. This includes sanitation, avoiding planting elm monocultures and breaking root grafts between elms. Disease cycle Ophiostoma ulmi can reproduce asexually by overwintering in both the bark and upper layers of dead or dying elm wood as mycelia and synnemata. Synnemata produce conidia that are sticky and can be spread by vectors. In Dutch elm disease, the vectors that transmit Ophiostoma ulmi are Scolytid beetles. The conidia stick to the bodies of adult beetles and are spread throughout the tunnels (galleries) the beetle makes as it eats. Once in a tunnel, the spores will germinate to produce mycelium. During the late winter months and early spring, mycelia spread rapidly. At the same time, the fungus secretes enzymes that break down the cell walls of the tree and allow the mycelia to grow into the xylem tissue. Here, it will release millions of conidia that travel with the xylem sap. As the fungus grows it creates blockages in the vascular system of the tree, causing the characteristic symptom of wilting in the leaves. As new beetles bore through the xylem tissue, they come into contact with conidia in the sap which stick to their bodies and can be transmitted to other trees that they feed on. The disease can also be spread if mature roots of an infected tree graft to another tree and the conidia travel through xylem sap to the new host. The fungi can also reproduce sexually. O. ulmi is a heterothallic ascomycete disease with mating types A and B. When these mating types are present in the same host, ascospores will be produced inside of perithecia. The perithecia can form singly or in large groups, and typically will have a long neck like structure with a black ball at the top. This ball contains the asci and ascospores. Once they are mature, the ascospores are released from an opening in the perithecia in a sticky liquid that can attach to the body of the Scolytid beetle and be spread throughout the host or to new hosts.

Milton's paternal uncle was the politician and patriot Andrew Fletcher. Career Having been educated for the Bar, he was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates on 26 February 1717. He succeeded Sir John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall as an Ordinary Lord in the Court of Session, as Lord Milton, taking his seat on 4 June 1724. On 22 August 1726 he was appointed a Lord of Justiciary in place of James Hamilton of Pencaitland, who had resigned. The following year Lord Milton was named by Letters Patent, dated 5 July, as one of the Commissioners for improving the fisheries and manufactures of Scotland. Upon the resignation of James Erskine of Grange, Lord Milton was constituted Lord Justice Clerk, taking his seat on 21 June 1735. On 10 November 1746, he was appointed Principal Keeper of His Majesty's Signet. He resigned his office as Lord Justice Clerk in 1748, but retained his appointments with the Signet and as judge of the Court of Session until his death. In the mid-18th century he built Milton House on the south side of the Canongate on the Royal Mile, around ten minutes walk from the High Court. The building survived until the 20th century but is now only remembered in the name Milton House School which stands on its site.Edinburgh and District: Ward Lock Travel Guide 1930 General During the 1745 Jacobite rising, Lord Milton was much admired for the mild and judicious manner with which he conducted himself as Lord Justice Clerk in that difficult time. He abstained as much as possible from severe measures, and adopted means either to conceal, or recall such of the rebels as had been misled, as he put it, from the paths of loyalty, rather than actuated by premeditated designs to overturn the government. Much information which he suspected was sent to him by over- officious and malignant people, was found in his cupboards after his death, unopened. He was the friend and co-adjutor of Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, and from the knowledge Lord Milton possessed of the laws, customs, and nature of Scotland, proved a useful auxiliary to that statesman, and a good friend to his country, in pointing out such individuals as he judged to be best qualified to fill vacancies in the church, and as Sheriffs. At the same time he used his best endeavors to promote the welfare of Scotland, in improving its trade, manufactures, and agriculture. Family Lord Milton married Elizabeth Kinloch, daughter of Sir Francis Kinloch, 2nd Baronet, of Gilmerton and his wife Mary Leslie, daughter of David Leslie, 1st Lord Newark. Their children included: * Andrew Fletcher, Auditor of Exchequer (Scotland) (d.1799) * John Fletcher Campbell FRSE (1727–1806), of Saltoun, Haddingtonshire, & Boquhan, Stirlingshire. This laird assumed the additional surname of Campbell upon his succession to the estate of Boquhan, and married, in 1795, Ann or Agnes Thriepland or Threpleton, with two sons, Andrew and Henry. In 1803 he reassumed the title simply of Andrew Fletcher.http://www.fdca.org.uk/1780_ColJohnCampbell_Boquhan.html References * An Historical Account of the Senators of the College of Justice of Scotland, originally by Sir David Dalrymple of Hailes, Bt., re- edited and continued, Edinburgh, 1849, pps: 498-499. * History of the Carnegies, Earls of Southesk, by William Fraser, Edinburgh, 1867, vol.II, pps: 266-274. * The Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal, The Anne of Exeter Volume, by the Marquis of Ruvigny & Raineval, London, 1907, table LVI.

Known internationally as \\"The King of the Cuatro,\\" Toro recorded over 150 albums throughout a 60-year career and worked extensively with Cuban legends Arsenio Rodríguez and Alfonso \\"El Panameño\\" Joseph; salsa artists Willie Colón, Héctor Lavoe and Rubén Blades; and artists from other music genres including Frankie Cutlass, Harry Belafonte, Paul Simon, Linda Ronstadt and David Byrne. Early years Victor Guillermo Toro was born in Ensenada, within the municipality of Guánica, near the southwestern corner of Puerto Rico. His father, Alberto, drove a truck for the sugarcane mills of the South Porto Rican Sugar Company and played cuatro in a band along with Yomo Toro's uncles. Nicknamed \\"Yomo\\" by his father, Toro began to play music at age 6. At age 15, Toro formed the string trio La Bandita de la Escuela (\\"The Little School Band\\"). He continued his musical career by performing at events with La Bandita and other trios, all over the island of Puerto Rico, as well as on the radio program La Montaña Canta (The Mountain Sings). The cuatro A Puerto Rican cuatro The cuatro is the national instrument of Puerto Rico. Larger than a mandolin, it contains ten strings which generate complex tones and multiple harmonic series. The Puerto Rican cuatro spans five courses, tuned in fourths from low to high B-e- a-d'-g',54321, with B and E in octaves and A, D and G in unisons. Yomo Toro and his cuatro music became internationally known, when he performed the opening theme song to the 1971 Woody Allen film Bananas. In the U.S., Toro's reputation as a cuatro player had already grown steadily throughout the 1950s and 60's. In the 1970s and 80's, his concert tours with the Fania All Stars and studio recordings on numerous Willie Colón and Héctor Lavoe albums, made him a musical sensation in Latin America. His Christmas albums Asalto Navideño and Feliz Navidad became instant classics, and are now rare collector's items. Folkloric style Yomo Toro preserved the traditional Puerto Rican form known as Jibaro music - a folk music from the Puerto Rican hill country that is buoyant, romantic, humorous, and extremely life-affirming. Many of Toro's lyrics were arranged 10-line verses called decimas, a poetic Spanish form that was popular as early as the 17th century. African rhythms also influenced both Jibaro music, and Yomo Toro's own evolving style. For orchestration and song structure, Yomo Toro often used the bomba format. For rhythm and instrumentation, he made heavy use of the traditional Barril de bomba - a Puerto Rican drum with African origins - and Toro improvised spiraling cuatro solos over the bomba rhythms. Though firmly grounded in Puerto Rican musical tradition, Yomo Toro's style was extremely textured and eclectic. As a studio musician for hundreds of album releases, he also played Latin jazz, classical guitar, bluegrass, and even R&B.; As noted by The New York Times, \\"Mr. Toro absorbed all these influences, plus the African, Spanish and Creole folk traditions of his native Puerto Rico. The richness and variety of these sources is at least partly responsible for the depth, range and vitality of Mr. Toro's playing.\\" International career Toro played traditional Puerto Rican and Mexican music on guitar and cuatro in New York through the 1950s and ’60s — with the singers Odilio González and Victor Rolón Santiago and with the Trio Los Panchos, the internationally famous Mexican bolero trio, Los Rivereños, Yomo Toro covered two famous compositions titled \\"Fuikiti\\" and \\"Una Pena En La Navidad\\" by Miguel Poventud copyrighted by Peer and covered on Fania recordings of Yomo Toro performances in Albums \\"Celebremos Navidad\\" and \\"Herencia\\" He was hired to play on a Christmas-themed salsa record by Willie Colón called Asalto Navideño (\\"Christmas Assault\\") which included several of Toro's aguinaldos and songs from the Puerto Rican parranda, or caroling, tradition. Asalto Navideño became one of the most successful releases for Fania Records, and its fame solidified the cuatro's role in the salsa scene. The success of Asalto Navideño led to a sequel in 1973, as well as a third holiday record in 1979 with Hector Lavoe and the singer Daniel Santos. On the covers of those two albums, Yomo Toro is dressed as Santa Claus. Short, round and joyous, Toro was well-suited to the role, and went on to reprise it in many holiday concerts. Toro toured the world with the Fania All-Stars in the 1970s and recorded two solo albums for Fania, Romantico and Musica Para El Mundo Entero. During the height of the salsa era he also played on more albums with Willie Colón, Ismael Rivera, Larry Harlow, Cheo Feliciano, Típica 73, and many others. Musical legacy Yomo Toro at a jazz club in New York City in 2000 Yomo Toro's artistry with the cuatro was celebrated throughout the world. He recorded with major artists such as Cuban legend Arsenio Rodríguez and Arsenio's bassist Alfonso \\"El Panameño\\" Joseph. Toro appeared in over 150 albums and over 20 solo albums on various record labels such as Island Records, Fania Records, Rounder, and Green Linnet Records. He also recorded four albums with Trio Los Panchos, including one featuring Eydie Gormé. Toro crossed over to many other genres and recorded songs with Harry Belafonte, Paul Simon, Linda Ronstadt and David Byrne. He also worked on several film tracks such as Bananas by director Woody Allen and Crossover Dreams with Ruben Blades. According to The New York Times, Yomo Toro \\"electrified his cuatro, performed as a soloist with salsa's flashy Fania All-Stars, and appeared on several hundred albums, ranging from straight jibaro to mainstream Latin-pop.\\" Despite his fame and musical virtuosity, Yomo Toro was a modest and unassuming man. He composed only one song about himself. It appeared on the Fania label as El Lechon de Cachete. Television career During the late 60s and early 70s, Toro hosted the \\"Yomo Toro Show.\\" It aired on Channel 41 in New York (later known as Univision) and featured Yomo Toro's music, plus entertainment news and interviews of Latin celebrities. Toro also many bombas and aguinaldos on the children's television show Dora the Explorer. Later years Yomo Toro was a member of the Toro (Touro) family of Guanica. He died of kidney failure in Calvary Hospital in the Bronx, New York, on 30 June 2012. He was buried at Saint Michaels Cemetery in Queens, New York Yomo Toro was survived by his sisters, Lydia, Iris, Gloria, Mirza and Milagros Toro; his brothers, Juan, Angel and Arcangel Toro; his wife of 31 years Minerva; his daughter Denise, five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Recorded works Yomo Toro performed on hundreds of albums throughout his 60-year career. He also released over 20 solo albums on major record labels including Island Records, Fania Records, and Polygram.

The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100 BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out. The gods' complex characteristics were expressed in myths and in intricate relationships between deities: family ties, loose groups and hierarchies, and combinations of separate gods into one. Deities' diverse appearances in art—as animals, humans, objects, and combinations of different forms—also alluded, through symbolism, to their essential features. In different eras, various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society, including the solar deity Ra, the mysterious god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. The highest deity was usually credited with the creation of the world and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. Some scholars have argued, based in part on Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world, except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused exclusively on an abstract solar deity, the Aten. Gods were assumed to be present throughout the world, capable of influencing natural events and the course of human lives. People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines, for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state rites. Egyptians prayed for divine help, used rituals to compel deities to act, and called upon them for advice. Humans' relations with their gods were a fundamental part of Egyptian society. Definition The beings in ancient Egyptian tradition who might be labeled as deities are difficult to count. Egyptian texts list the names of many deities whose nature is unknown and make vague, indirect references to other gods who are not even named. The Egyptologist James P. Allen estimates that more than 1,400 deities are named in Egyptian texts, whereas his colleague Christian Leitz says there are \\"thousands upon thousands\\" of gods. The Egyptian language's terms for these beings were nṯr, \\"god\\", and its feminine form nṯrt, \\"goddess\\". Scholars have tried to discern the original nature of the gods by proposing etymologies for these words, but none of these suggestions has gained acceptance, and the terms' origin remains obscure. The hieroglyphs that were used as ideograms and determinatives in writing these words show some of the traits that the Egyptians connected with divinity. The most common of these signs is a flag flying from a pole. Similar objects were placed at the entrances of temples, representing the presence of a deity, throughout ancient Egyptian history. Other such hieroglyphs include a falcon, reminiscent of several early gods who were depicted as falcons, and a seated male or female deity. The feminine form could also be written with an egg as determinative, connecting goddesses with creation and birth, or with a cobra, reflecting the use of the cobra to depict many female deities. The Egyptians distinguished nṯrw, \\"gods\\", from rmṯ, \\"people\\", but the meanings of the Egyptian and the English terms do not match perfectly. The term nṯr may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the sphere of everyday life. Deceased humans were called nṯr because they were considered to be like the gods, whereas the term was rarely applied to many of Egypt's lesser supernatural beings, which modern scholars often call \\"demons\\". Egyptian religious art also depicts places, objects, and concepts in human form. These personified ideas range from deities that were important in myth and ritual to obscure beings, only mentioned once or twice, that may be little more than metaphors. Confronting these blurred distinctions between gods and other beings, scholars have proposed various definitions of a \\"deity\\". One widely accepted definition, suggested by Jan Assmann, says that a deity has a cult, is involved in some aspect of the universe, and is described in mythology or other forms of written tradition. According to a different definition, by Dimitri Meeks, nṯr applied to any being that was the focus of ritual. From this perspective, \\"gods\\" included the king, who was called a god after his coronation rites, and deceased souls, who entered the divine realm through funeral ceremonies. Likewise, the preeminence of the great gods was maintained by the ritual devotion that was performed for them across Egypt. Origins The first written evidence of deities in Egypt comes from the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3100–2686 BC). Deities must have emerged sometime in the preceding Predynastic Period (before 3100 BC) and grown out of prehistoric religious beliefs. Predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures. Some of these images, such as stars and cattle, are reminiscent of important features of Egyptian religion in later times, but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities. As Egyptian society grew more sophisticated, clearer signs of religious activity appeared. The earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the predynastic era, along with images that resemble the iconographies of known deities: the falcon that represents Horus and several other gods, the crossed arrows that stand for Neith, and the enigmatic \\"Set animal\\" that represents Set. Statue of the baboon god Hedj-Wer, inscribed with the name of the late Predynastic king Narmer Many Egyptologists and anthropologists have suggested theories about how the gods developed in these early times. Gustave Jéquier, for instance, thought the Egyptians first revered primitive fetishes, then deities in animal form, and finally deities in human form, whereas Henri Frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning. Some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic, and more current ones, such as Siegfried Morenz' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment, are difficult to prove. Predynastic Egypt originally consisted of small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were strongly tied to particular towns and regions, many scholars have suggested that the pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities. Others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite its political divisions. The final step in the formation of Egyptian religion was the unification of Egypt, in which rulers from Upper Egypt made themselves pharaohs of the entire country. These sacred kings and their subordinates assumed the right to interact with the gods, and kingship became the unifying focus of the religion. New deities continued to emerge after this transformation. Some important deities such as Isis and Amun are not known to have appeared until the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC). Places and concepts could inspire the creation of a deity to represent them, and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite-sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses. Kings were said to be divine, although only a few continued to be worshipped long after their deaths. Some non-royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly. This veneration was usually short-lived, but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes, as were some other officials. Through contact with neighboring civilizations, the Egyptians also adopted foreign deities. Dedun, who is first mentioned in the Old Kingdom, may have come from Nubia, and Baal, Anat, and Astarte, among others, were adopted from Canaanite religion during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC). In Greek and Roman times, from 332 BC to the early centuries AD, deities from across the Mediterranean world were revered in Egypt, but the native gods remained, and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship. Characteristics Modern knowledge of Egyptian beliefs about the gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, most of whom were illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature. =Roles= Isis, a mother goddess and a patroness of kingship, holds Pharaoh Seti I in her lap. Most Egyptian deities represent natural or social phenomena. The gods were generally said to be immanent in these phenomena—to be present within nature. The types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces. The god Shu was the deification of all the world's air; the goddess Meretseger oversaw a limited region of the earth, the Theban Necropolis; and the god Sia personified the abstract notion of perception. Major gods were often involved in several types of phenomena. For instance, Khnum was the god of Elephantine Island in the midst of the Nile, the river that was essential to Egyptian civilization. He was credited with producing the annual Nile flood that fertilized the nation's farmland. Perhaps as an outgrowth of this life-giving function, he was said to create all living things, fashioning their bodies on a potter's wheel. Gods could share the same role in nature; Ra, Atum, Khepri, Horus, and other deities acted as sun gods. Despite their diverse functions, most gods had an overarching role in common: maintaining maat, the universal order that was a central principle of Egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess. But some deities represented disruption to maat. Most prominently, Apep was the force of chaos, constantly threatening to annihilate the order of the universe, and Set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it. Not all aspects of existence were seen as deities. Although many deities were connected with the Nile, no god personified it in the way that Ra personified the sun. Short- lived phenomena, such as rainbows or eclipses, were not represented by gods; neither were fire, water, or many other components of the world. The roles of each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature to take on new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are difficult to categorize or define. Despite this flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach beyond the boundaries of the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that as beliefs about the god Amun evolved he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence, and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not. The deities with the most limited and specialized domains are often called \\"minor divinities\\" or \\"demons\\" in modern writing, although there is no firm definition for these terms. Some demons were guardians of particular places, especially in the Duat, the realm of the dead. Others wandered through the human world and the Duat, either as servants and messengers of the greater gods or as roving spirits that caused illness or other misfortunes among humans. Demons' position in the divine hierarchy was not fixed. The protective deities Bes and Taweret originally had minor, demon-like roles, but over time they came to be credited with great influence. The most feared beings in the Duat were regarded as both disgusting and dangerous to humans. Over the course of Egyptian history, they came to be regarded as fundamentally inferior members of divine society and to represent the opposite of the beneficial, life-giving major gods. Yet even the most revered deities could sometimes exact vengeance on humans or each other, displaying a demon-like side to their character and blurring the boundaries between demons and gods. =Behavior= Divine behavior was believed to govern all of nature. Except for the few deities who disrupted the divine order, the gods' actions maintained maat and created and sustained all living things. They did this work using a force the Egyptians called heka, a term usually translated as \\"magic\\". Heka was a fundamental power that the creator god used to form the world and the gods themselves. Nut swallows the sun, which travels through her body at night to be reborn at dawn. The gods' actions in the present are described and praised in hymns and funerary texts. In contrast, mythology mainly concerns the gods' actions during a vaguely imagined past in which the gods were present on earth and interacted directly with humans. The events of this past time set the pattern for the events of the present. Periodic occurrences were tied to events in the mythic past; the succession of each new pharaoh, for instance, reenacted Horus's accession to the throne of his father Osiris. Myths are metaphors for the gods' actions, which humans cannot fully understand. They contain seemingly contradictory ideas, each expressing a particular perspective on divine events. The contradictions in myth are part of the Egyptians' many-faceted approach to religious belief—what Henri Frankfort called a \\"multiplicity of approaches\\" to understanding the gods. In myth, the gods behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique character traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron of writing and knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Different versions of a myth could portray different deities playing the same archetypal role, as in the myths of the Eye of Ra, a feminine aspect of the sun god who was represented by many goddesses. Deities' mythic behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths lack highly developed characters and plots, because their symbolic meaning was more important than elaborate storytelling. The first divine act is the creation of the cosmos, described in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place. A recurring theme in these myths is the effort of the gods to maintain maat against the forces of disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris's murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos. =Locations= provinces of Egypt Gods were linked to specific regions of the universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with other parts of the universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulties in communicating with those in the world of the living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world. In the time after myth, most gods were said to be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, their homes in the human world. There they inhabited the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron deity for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god Montu and then Amun—to national prominence. =Names and epithets= In Egyptian belief, names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer. In keeping with this belief, the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins. The name of the predatory goddess Sekhmet means \\"powerful one\\", the name of the mysterious god Amun means \\"hidden one\\", and the name of Nekhbet, who was worshipped in the city of Nekheb, means \\"she of Nekheb\\". Many other names have no certain meaning, even when the gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role. The names of the sky goddess Nut and the earth god Geb do not resemble the Egyptian terms for sky and earth. The Egyptians also devised false etymologies giving more meanings to divine names. A passage in the Coffin Texts renders the name of the funerary god Sokar as sk r, meaning \\"cleaning of the mouth\\", to link his name with his role in the Opening of the Mouth ritual, while one in the Pyramid Texts says the name is based on words shouted by Osiris in a moment of distress, connecting Sokar with the most important funerary deity. The gods were believed to have many names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the true name of a deity was to have power over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power. In addition to their names, gods were given epithets, like \\"possessor of splendor\\", \\"ruler of Abydos\\", or \\"lord of the sky\\", that describe some aspect of their roles or their worship. Because of the gods' multiple and overlapping roles, deities can have many epithets—with more important gods accumulating more titles—and the same epithet can apply to many deities. Some epithets eventually became separate deities, as with Werethekau, an epithet applied to several goddesses meaning \\"great enchantress\\", which came to be treated as an independent goddess. The host of divine names and titles expresses the gods' multifarious nature. =Gender and sexuality= The Egyptians regarded the division between male and female as fundamental to all beings, including deities. Male gods tended to have a higher status than goddesses and were more closely connected with creation and with kingship, while goddesses were more often thought of as helping and providing for humans. Some deities were androgynous, but most examples are found in the context of creation myths, in which the androgynous deity represents the undifferentiated state that existed before the world was created. Atum was primarily male but had a feminine aspect within himself, who was sometimes seen as a goddess, known as Iusaaset or Nebethetepet. Creation began when Atum produced a sexually differentiated pair of deities: Shu and his consort Tefnut. Similarly, Neith, who was sometimes regarded as a creator goddess, was said to possess masculine traits but was mainly seen as female. Sex and gender were closely tied to creation and thus rebirth. Male gods were believed to have the active role in conceiving children. Female deities were often relegated to a supporting role, stimulating their male consorts' virility and nurturing their children, although goddesses were given a larger role in procreation late in Egyptian history. Goddesses acted as mythological mothers and wives of kings and thus as prototypes of human queenship. Hathor, who was the mother or consort of Horus and the most important goddess for much of Egyptian history, exemplified this relationship between divinity and the king. Female deities also had a violent aspect that could be seen either positively, as with the goddesses Wadjet and Nekhbet who protected the king, or negatively. The myth of the Eye of Ra contrasts feminine aggression with sexuality and nurturing, as the goddess rampages in the form of Sekhmet or another dangerous deity until the other gods appease her, at which point she becomes a benign goddess such as Hathor who, in some versions, then becomes the consort of a male god. The Egyptian conception of sexuality was heavily focused on heterosexual reproduction, and homosexual acts were usually viewed with disapproval. Some texts nevertheless refer to homosexual behavior between male deities. In some cases, most notably when Set sexually assaulted Horus, these acts served to assert the dominance of the active partner and humiliate the submissive one. Other couplings between male deities could be viewed positively and even produce offspring, as in one text in which Khnum is born from the union of Ra and Shu. =Relationships= Egyptian deities are connected in a complex and shifting array of relationships. A god's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character. Thus Isis, as the mother and protector of Horus, was a great healer as well as the patroness of kings. Such relationships were in fact more important than myths in expressing Egyptians' religious worldview, although they were also the base material from which myths were formed. The gods Ptah and Sekhmet flank the king, who takes the role of their child, Nefertum. Family relationships are a common type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent the creation of new life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these vary according to the circumstances. Hathor could act as the mother, consort, or daughter of the sun god, and the child form of Horus acted as the third member of many local family triads. Other divine groups were composed of deities with interrelated roles, or who together represented a region of the Egyptian mythological cosmos. There were sets of gods for the hours of the day and night and for each nome (province) of Egypt. Some of these groups contain a specific, symbolically important number of deities. Paired gods sometimes have similar roles, as do Isis and her sister Nephthys in their protection and support of Osiris. Other pairs stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity. Ra, who is dynamic and light-producing, and Osiris, who is static and shrouded in darkness, merge into a single god each night. Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought, and groups of four connote completeness. Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others: Amun, Ra, and Ptah. These deities stood for the plurality of all gods, as well as for their own cult centers (the major cities of Thebes, Heliopolis, and Memphis) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought. Sometimes Set, the patron god of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world, was added to this group, which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon. Nine, the product of three and three, represents a multitude, so the Egyptians called several large groups \\"enneads\\", or sets of nine, even if they had more than nine members. The most prominent ennead was the Ennead of Heliopolis, an extended family of deities descended from Atum, which incorporates many important gods. The term \\"ennead\\" was often extended to include all of Egypt's deities. This divine assemblage had a vague and changeable hierarchy. Gods with broad influence in the cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine society. At the apex of this society was the king of the gods, who was usually identified with the creator deity. In different periods of Egyptian history, different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position. Horus was the most important god in the Early Dynastic Period, Ra rose to preeminence in the Old Kingdom, Amun was supreme in the New, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, Isis was the divine queen and creator goddess. Newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors. Isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise, and when Amun became the ruler of the pantheon, he was conjoined with Ra to become a solar deity. =Manifestations and combinations= Min. The solar disk on his headdress is taken from Ra, and his erect phallus comes from the iconography of Min. The gods were believed to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had a complex conception of the human soul, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed of many of these same elements. The ba was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it. Any visible manifestation of a god's power could be called its ba; thus, the sun was called the ba of Ra. A depiction of a deity was considered a ka, another component of its being, which acted as a vessel for that deity's ba to inhabit. The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals, as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities, were believed to house divine bas in this way. Gods could be ascribed many bas and kas, which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god's nature. Everything in existence was said to be one of the kas of Atum the creator god, who originally contained all things within himself, and one deity could be called the ba of another, meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other's power. Divine body parts could act as separate deities, like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, both of which were personified as goddesses. The gods were so full of life-giving power that even their bodily fluids could transform into other living things; humankind was said to have sprung from the creator god's tears, and the other deities from his sweat. Nationally important deities gave rise to local manifestations, which sometimes absorbed the characteristics of older regional gods. Horus had many forms tied to particular places, including Horus of Nekhen, Horus of Buhen, and Horus of Edfu. Such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings. During the New Kingdom, one man was accused of stealing clothes by an oracle supposed to communicate messages from Amun of Pe-Khenty. He consulted two other local oracles of Amun hoping for a different judgment. Gods' manifestations also differed according to their roles. Horus could be a powerful sky god or vulnerable child, and these forms were sometimes counted as independent deities. Gods were combined with each other as easily as they were divided. A god could be called the ba of another, or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography. Local gods were linked with greater ones, and deities with similar functions were combined. Ra was connected with the local deity Sobek to form Sobek-Ra; with his fellow ruling god, Amun, to form Amun-Ra; with the solar form of Horus to form Ra-Horakhty; and with several solar deities as Horemakhet-Khepri-Ra-Atum. On rare occasion, deities of different sexes could be joined in this way, producing combinations such as Osiris-Neith. This linking of deities is called syncretism. Unlike other situations for which this term is used, the Egyptian practice was not meant to fuse competing belief systems, although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones. Instead, syncretism acknowledged the overlap between deities' roles and extended the sphere of influence for each of them. Syncretic combinations were not permanent; a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities. But closely connected deities did sometimes merge. Horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions, such as Khenti-irty and Khenti-kheti, who became little more than local manifestations of him; Hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess, Bat; and an early funerary god, Khenti-Amentiu, was supplanted by Osiris and Anubis. =Aten and possible monotheism= In the reign of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, targeting Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. The Aten had no mythology, and it was portrayed and described in more abstract terms than traditional deities. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism may not have been full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace continued to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, such as Maat, Shu, and Tefnut. For these reasons, the Egyptologists Dominic Montserrat and John Baines have suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs. =Unity of the divine in traditional religion= The god Bes with the attributes of many other deities. Images like this one represent the presence of a multitude of divine powers within a single being. Scholars have long debated whether traditional Egyptian religion ever asserted that the multiple gods were, on a deeper level, unified. Reasons for this debate include the practice of syncretism, which might suggest that all the separate gods could ultimately merge into one, and the tendency of Egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities. Another point of contention is the appearance of the word \\"god\\" in wisdom literature, where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities. In the early 20th century, for instance, E. A. Wallis Budge believed that Egyptian commoners were polytheistic, but knowledge of the true monotheistic nature of the religion was reserved for the elite, who wrote the wisdom literature. His contemporary James Henry Breasted thought Egyptian religion was instead pantheistic, with the power of the sun god present in all other gods, while Hermann Junker argued that Egyptian civilization had been originally monotheistic and became polytheistic in the course of its history. In 1971, Erik Hornung published a study rebutting such views. He points out that in any given period many deities, even minor ones, were described as superior to all others. He also argues that the unspecified \\"god\\" in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity is relevant to the reader in the situation at hand. Although the combinations, manifestations, and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting, they were always restricted to a finite number of forms, never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way. Henotheism, Hornung says, describes Egyptian religion better than other labels. An Egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment, without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on. Hornung concludes that the gods were fully unified only in myth, at the time before creation, after which the multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence. Hornung's arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion, but some still believe that at times the gods were more unified than he allows. Jan Assmann maintains that the notion of a single deity developed slowly through the New Kingdom, beginning with a focus on Amun-Ra as the all-important sun god. In his view, Atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend. It equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods. Then, in the backlash against Atenism, priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way, one that coexisted with traditional polytheism. The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities, while at the same time, the multiple gods were aspects of the one. According to Assmann, this one god was especially equated with Amun, the dominant god in the late New Kingdom, whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods. James P. Allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the \\"multiplicity of approaches\\" in Egyptian thought, as well as with the henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers. He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by \\"identifying their uniform notion of 'god' with a particular god, depending on the particular situation.\\" Descriptions and depictions Egyptian writings describe the gods' bodies in detail. They are made of precious materials; their flesh is gold, their bones are silver, and their hair is lapis lazuli. They give off a scent that the Egyptians likened to the incense used in rituals. Some texts give precise descriptions of particular deities, including their height and eye color. Yet these characteristics are not fixed; in myths, gods change their appearances to suit their own purposes. Egyptian texts often refer to deities' true, underlying forms as \\"mysterious\\". The Egyptians' visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal. They symbolize specific aspects of each deity's character, functioning much like the ideograms in hieroglyphic writing. For this reason, the funerary god Anubis is commonly shown in Egyptian art as a dog or jackal, a creature whose scavenging habits threaten the preservation of buried mummies, in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection. His black coloring alludes to the color of mummified flesh and to the fertile black soil that Egyptians saw as a symbol of resurrection. Most deities were depicted in several ways. Hathor could be a cow, cobra, lioness, or a woman with bovine horns or ears. By depicting a given god in different ways, the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature. The gods are depicted in a finite number of these symbolic forms, so they can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies. These forms include men and women (anthropomorphism), animals (zoomorphism), and, more rarely, inanimate objects. Combinations of forms, such as deities with human bodies and animal heads, are common. New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history, with the most surreal forms often found among the demons of the underworld. Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing, as with Isis and Hathor. Because of the close connection between these goddesses, they could both wear the cow-horn headdress that was originally Hathor's alone. Statue of the crocodile god Sobek in fully animal form, possibly a cult image from a temple Certain features of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god's identity. The head of a given divine image is particularly significant. In a hybrid image, the head represents the original form of the being depicted, so that, as the Egyptologist Henry Fischer put it, \\"a lion-headed goddess is a lion-goddess in human form, while a royal sphinx, conversely, is a man who has assumed the form of a lion.\\" Divine headdresses, which range from the same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods' heads, are another important indicator. In contrast, the objects held in gods' hands tend to be generic. Male deities hold was staffs, goddesses hold stalks of papyrus, and both sexes carry ankh signs, representing the Egyptian word for \\"life\\", to symbolize their life-giving power. The forms in which the gods are shown, although diverse, are limited in many ways. Many creatures that are widespread in Egypt were never used in divine iconography. Others could represent many deities, often because these deities had major characteristics in common. Bulls and rams were associated with virility, cows and falcons with the sky, hippopotami with maternal protection, felines with the sun god, and serpents with both danger and renewal. Animals that were absent from Egypt in the early stages of its history were not used as divine images. For instance, the horse, which was only introduced in the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650–1550 BC), never represented a god. Similarly, the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in most periods changed little from the styles used in the Old Kingdom: a kilt, false beard, and often a shirt for male gods and a long, tight-fitting dress for goddesses. The basic anthropomorphic form varies. Child gods are depicted nude, as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized. Certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts, signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance. Whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow—the same colors used to depict Egyptian men and women—some are given unusual, symbolic skin colors. Thus the blue skin and paunchy figure of the god Hapi alludes to the Nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought. A few deities, such as Osiris, Ptah, and Min, have a \\"mummiform\\" appearance, with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth. Although these gods resemble mummies, the earliest examples predate the cloth-wrapped style of mummification, and this form may instead hark back to the earliest, limbless depictions of deities. Some inanimate objects that represent deities are drawn from nature, such as trees or the disk-like emblems for the sun and the moon. Some objects associated with a specific god, like the crossed bows representing Neith (R24) or the emblem of Min (R22), symbolized the cults of those deities in Predynastic times. In many of these cases, the nature of the original object is mysterious. In the Predynastic and Early Dynastic Periods, gods were often represented by divine standards: poles topped by emblems of deities, including both animal forms and inanimate objects. Interactions with humans =Relationship with the pharaoh= Ramesses III presents offerings to Amun. In official writings, pharaohs are said to be divine, and they are constantly depicted in the company of the deities of the pantheon. Each pharaoh and his predecessors were considered the successors of the gods who had ruled Egypt in mythic prehistory. Living kings were equated with Horus and called the \\"son\\" of many male deities, particularly Osiris and Ra; deceased kings were equated with these elder gods. Kings' wives and mothers were likened to many goddesses. The few women who made themselves pharaohs, such as Hatshepsut, connected themselves with these same goddesses while adopting much of the masculine imagery of kingship. Pharaohs had their own mortuary temples where rituals were performed for them during their lives and after their deaths. But few pharaohs were worshipped as gods long after their lifetimes, and non-official texts portray kings in a human light. For these reasons, scholars disagree about how genuinely most Egyptians believed the king to be a god. He may only have been considered divine when he was performing ceremonies. However much it was believed, the king's divine status was the rationale for his role as Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live. =Presence in the human world= Although the Egyptians believed their gods to be present in the world around them, contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances. In literature, gods may appear to humans in a physical form, but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication. The ba of a god was said to periodically leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god. By inhabiting these images, the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form. To the Egyptians, a place or object that was ḏsr—\\"sacred\\"—was isolated and ritually pure, and thus fit for a god to inhabit. Temple statues and reliefs, as well as particular sacred animals, like the Apis bull, served as divine intermediaries in this way. Dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction. In these states, it was believed, people could come close to the gods and sometimes receive messages from them. Finally, according to Egyptian afterlife beliefs, human souls pass into the divine realm after death. The Egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same level as the gods and understand their mysterious nature. Abu Simbel Temples, where the state rituals were carried out, were filled with images of the gods. The most important temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary. These statues were usually less than life-size and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods' bodies. Many temples had several sanctuaries, each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad. The city's primary god was envisioned as its lord, employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented. The gods residing in the temples of Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon. But many deities—including some important gods as well as those that were minor or hostile—were never given temples of their own, although some were represented in the temples of other gods. To insulate the sacred power in the sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple enclosed in a portable shrine, which usually hid it from public view. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels near the back of the temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. =Intervention in human lives= Egyptian gods were involved in human lives as well as in the overarching order of nature. This divine influence applied mainly to Egypt, as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order. In the New Kingdom, when other nations were under Egyptian control, foreigners were said to be under the sun god's benign rule in the same way that Egyptians were. Thoth, as the overseer of time, was said to allot fixed lifespans to both humans and gods. Other gods were also said to govern the length of human lives, including Meskhenet and Renenutet, both of whom presided over birth, and Shai, the personification of fate. Thus the time and manner of death was the main meaning of the Egyptian concept of fate, although to some extent these deities governed other events in life as well. Several texts refer to gods influencing or inspiring human decisions, working through a person's \\"heart\\"—the seat of emotion and intellect in Egyptian belief. Deities were also believed to give commands, instructing the king in the governance of his realm and regulating the management of their temples. Egyptian texts rarely mention direct commands given to private persons, and these commands never evolved into a set of divinely enforced moral codes. Morality in ancient Egypt was based on the concept of maat, which, when applied to human society, meant that everyone should live in an orderly way that did not interfere with the well-being of other people. Because deities were the upholders of maat, morality was connected with them. For example, the gods judged humans' moral righteousness after death, and by the New Kingdom, a verdict of innocence in this judgment was believed to be necessary for admittance into the afterlife. In general, however, morality was based on practical ways to uphold maat in daily life, rather than on strict rules that the gods laid out. Amulet of the god Shed Humans had free will to ignore divine guidance and the behavior required by maat, but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, the force that manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural disasters and human ailments were seen as the work of angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing. Egyptian texts take different views on whether the gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen as a product of isfet, the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat, and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with isfet, such as Set, could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. Some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give theodicies in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of this human misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom. They emphasize humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee a good life. Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods' will. =Worship= Official religious practices, which maintained maat for the benefit of all Egypt, were related to, but distinct from, the religious practices of ordinary people, who sought the gods' help for their personal problems. Official religion involved a variety of rituals, based in temples. Some rites were performed every day, whereas others were festivals, taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity. The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies, in which their statues were clothed, anointed, and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor. These offerings, in addition to maintaining maat for the gods, celebrated deities' life-giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful. A woman worships Ra-Horakhty, who blesses her with rays of light.Festivals often involved a ceremonial procession in which a cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals were meant to be repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life. Personal interaction with the gods took many forms. People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles, run by temples, that were supposed to convey gods' answers to questions. Amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well-being or to impart the god's positive characteristics to the wearer. Private rituals invoked the gods' power to accomplish personal goals, from healing sickness to cursing enemies. These practices used heka, the same force of magic that the gods used, which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune. The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth, or even threatened a deity, to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal. Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers, and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help. Prayer and private offerings are generally called \\"personal piety\\": acts that reflect a close relationship between an individual and a god. Evidence of personal piety is scant before the New Kingdom. Votive offerings and personal names, many of which are theophoric, suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods. But firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the New Kingdom, reaching a peak late in that era. Scholars disagree about the meaning of this change—whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions. Egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples. They recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae. They gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to, or that symbolized the result they desired; thus a relief image of Hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility. Occasionally, a person took a particular god as a patron, dedicating his or her property or labor to the god's cult. These practices continued into the latest periods of Egyptian history. These later eras saw more religious innovations, including the practice of giving animal mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form, such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess Bastet. Some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship, but many of the great state gods were important in popular tradition. The worship of some Egyptian gods spread to neighboring lands, especially to Canaan and Nubia during the New Kingdom, when those regions were under pharaonic control. In Canaan, the exported deities, including Hathor, Amun, and Set, were often syncretized with native gods, who in turn spread to Egypt. The Egyptian deities may not have had permanent temples in Canaan, and their importance there waned after Egypt lost control of the region. In contrast, many temples to the major Egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in Nubia. After the end of Egyptian rule there, the imported gods, particularly Amun and Isis, were syncretized with local deities and remained part of the religion of Nubia's independent Kingdom of Kush. These gods were incorporated into the Nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in Egypt, so that Amun was considered the divine father of the king and Isis and other goddesses were linked with the Nubian queen, the kandake. Some deities reached farther. Taweret became a goddess in Minoan Crete, and Amun's oracle at Siwa Oasis was known to and consulted by people across the Mediterranean region. Jupiter Under the Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty and then Roman rule, Greeks and Romans introduced their own deities to Egypt. These newcomers equated the Egyptian gods with their own, as part of the Greco-Roman tradition of interpretatio graeca. The worship of the native gods was not swallowed up by that of foreign ones. Instead, Greek and Roman gods were adopted as manifestations of Egyptian ones. Egyptian cults sometimes incorporated Greek language, philosophy, iconography, and even temple architecture. Meanwhile, the cults of several Egyptian deities—particularly Isis, Osiris, Anubis, the form of Horus named Harpocrates, and the fused Greco-Egyptian god Serapis—were adopted into Roman religion and spread across the Roman Empire. Roman emperors, like Ptolemaic kings before them, invoked Isis and Serapis to endorse their authority, inside and outside Egypt. In the empire's complex mix of religious traditions, Thoth was transmuted into the legendary esoteric teacher Hermes Trismegistus, and Isis, who was venerated from Britain to Mesopotamia, became the focus of a Greek-style mystery cult. Isis and Hermes Trismegistus were both prominent in the Western esoteric tradition that grew from the Roman religious world. Temples and cults in Egypt itself declined as the Roman economy deteriorated in the third century AD, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians suppressed the veneration of Egyptian deities. The last formal cults, at Philae, died out in the fifth or sixth century. Most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years, remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries. In contrast, many of the practices involved in their worship, such as processions and oracles, were adapted to fit Christian ideology and persisted as part of the Coptic Church. Given the great changes and diverse influences in Egyptian culture since that time, scholars disagree about whether any modern Coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion. But many festivals and other traditions of modern Egyptians, both Christian and Muslim, resemble the worship of their ancestors' gods.

It has an elevation of 4,949 feet (1,508 meters) above sea level. The mountain's majestic summit makes it a popular hiking destination. Another feature that attracts many visitors are the flame azaleas that bloom over the bald every summer. The azaleas reach peak bloom around mid-to-late June. Gregory Bald is located along the Tennessee-North Carolina border, between Blount County and Swain County. It rises appx. 3,000 feet above its northern base in Cades Cove, and appx. 3,300 feet above its southern base at Fontana Lake. The mountain is located entirely within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Gregory Bald is a type of mountain known as a grassy bald. Unlike most summits in the Appalachians, which are heavily forested or culminate in jagged peaks, grassy balds are covered by a thick layer of wild grass. Trees and other foliage are sparse. How and why a summit develops into a grassy bald is unknown. While there is evidence that Gregory Bald was a natural grassy bald, the National Park Service must currently work to prevent the summit from becoming forested.Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of an Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 33. Geology Gregory Bald is composed of a precambrian rock known as Elkmont sandstone.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 150. In a few places atop the mountain, sandstone ruts actually erupt through the thick grass. The Elkmont sandstone is part of the Ocoee Supergroup, which was formed from ancient ocean sediments between 500 million and one billion years ago. Gregory Bald, along with most mountains in the area, was formed appx. 200 million years ago during the Appalachian orogeny.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 26-27. History View from the summit of Gregory Bald, looking northeast. Cades Cove is the strip of land in the valley below. The Cherokee name for Gregory Bald was \\"Tsistu'yi,\\" or \\"Rabbit Place.\\" According to tribal lore, the chief of all rabbits-- known simply as the Great Rabbit-- lived at the summit.James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 407. The rabbit, considered by the Cherokee to be sly and mischievous, was a key figure in tribal legends, showing the importance the tribe placed upon the mountain.James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 231. The mountain was listed by Arnold Guyot in his 1856 survey of the Smokies, although Guyot gave it the name \\"Great Bald's Central Peak\\", and measured its elevation at 4,922 feet.Robert Mason, The Lure of the Great Smokies (Boston and New York: Houghton-Mifflen, 1927), 55-56. The name \\"Gregory Bald\\" was given to the mountain by Cades Cove residents in honor of Russell Gregory (1795–1864), a prominent Cades Cove settler. He and two other settlers made a deal to each take 1/3 of the land to live upon. Gregory used the mountain to graze cattle during the spring and summer, when the fields in the cove were needed for growing crops. He lived atop the mountain during this part of the year in a circular stone house near the mountain's summit (the house is no longer standing).Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of an Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 44. Gregory, who (like most Cades Covers) supported the Union during the American Civil War, was murdered by a Confederate soldier in 1864 while trying to protect his cattle and land. His grave bears the legend \\"Murdered by North Carolina rebels\\". Access The Gregory Bald Trail approaching the summit. The summit of Gregory Bald can be reached via several well-maintained hiking trails. From Cades Cove, the summit can be reached via the Gregory Ridge Trail (5.5 miles). This trail begins at the end of Forge Creek Road, which is a gravel road on the Cades Cove Loop just past the Cable Mill area. From Fontana, the summit is reached via the Appalachian Trail and a two-mile connector trail (7.3 miles). From Twentymile, the summit is reached via the Wolf Ridge Trail (7.3 miles). From the summit, one can see Cades Cove and Rich Mountain to the north, and the Nantahala and Yellow Creek Mountains to the south. Visible to the east is the crest of the Smokies, including Thunderhead Mountain and Clingman's Dome. Fontana Lake and Shuckstack are discernible to the southeast.

In 2006, the BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, conducted this series of large-scale fire tests in a high-rise building in collaboration with the BBC series Horizon, EPSRC, Glasgow Housing Association, Strathclyde Fire Brigade, Glasgow Caledonian University, Lion TV, Arup, BRE, Xtralis and Powerwall Systems Ltd, among other contributors. Description The building, a 23-storey reinforced-concrete tower located at 4 Millerfield Place in Dalmarnock, Glasgow, was scheduled for demolition and hence was evacuated of tenants. Three main experiments were conducted over two days, from 25 to 26 July 2006. Tests One and Two took place in identical flats, the main compartment of which had been fitted with regular living room and office furniture, arranged to provide conditions that favour repeatability. Test Three was a smaller smoke management experiment held in one of the two main emergency exit stairwells. Tests One and Two were fully instrumented with a high sensor density, including measurements of temperature, incident heat, gas velocities, smoke obscuration, wall temperature and structure deflection, among others. The tests varied in that Test One allowed the fire to develop freely to post-flashover conditions, while Test Two incorporated sensor-informed ventilation management and was extinguished before post-flashover conditions were attained. Both tests had approximately 300 sensors monitoring several different characteristics of the fire environment, but Test One had about 160 additional sensors monitoring the structural response. These experiments endeavoured to establish a highly monitored fire in a realistic residential scenario, allowing for several different modern fire safety engineering tools to be tested. The comprehensive set of data collected is being used for validation of different mathematical models of fire dynamics. Because the data has a spatial resolution high enough to be comparable to typical resolutions of CFD fire models, the tests are specially well suited for validation of this type of models. The tests also form an integral part of the research conducted for the FireGrid research project, that is, the development of emergency control systems that use continuous sensor data and computer modelling, to provide forecast of the fire evolution and aid the efficient deployment of resources. Analysis and dissemination Analysis of the copious amounts of test data collected will take several years to complete. Nevertheless, there has been significant dissemination activities of the findings to date in the form of several related journal and conference papers; a one-day seminar introducing the tests and highlighting the analysis and conclusions to date (held in Edinburgh, November 2007); and a book detailing the tests and analysis completed to date was published in November 2007. The book, entitled The Dalmarnock Fire Tests: Experiments and Modelling, comprises material covering characterisation and comparison of both the Test One and Test Two fires; experimental error analysis; evaluation of the fire detection systems; calculation of heat transfer to the structure; analysis of the structural behaviour; evaluation of ceiling fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) performance; and comparison of both a priori and a posteriori computational fire, modelling against experimental data allowing for an evaluation of such the current use of tools. The overall aim of the Dalmarnock fire tests is to improve understanding of how building fire emergencies can be handled in the most effective manner, while providing further insights into the fundamentals of compartment fire dynamics and fire- induced structural behaviour.

The compositions of mobilomes differ among lineages of life, with transposable elements being the major mobile elements in eukaryotes, and plasmids and prophages being the major types in prokaryotes. Virophages contribute to the viral mobilome.  Mobilome in eukaryotes  Transposable elements are elements that can move about or propagate within the genome, and are the major constituents of the eukaryotic mobilome. Transposable elements can be regarded as genetic parasites because they exploit the host cell's transcription and translation mechanisms to extract and insert themselves in different parts of the genome, regardless of the phenotypic effect on the host. Eukaryotic transposable elements were first discovered in maize (Zea mays) in which kernels showed a dotted color pattern. Barbara McClintock described the maize Ac/Ds system in which the Ac locus promotes the excision of the Ds locus from the genome, and excised Ds elements can mutate genes responsible for pigment production by inserting into their coding regions. Other examples of transposable elements include: yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Ty elements, a retrotransposon which encodes a reverse transcriptase to convert its mRNA transcript into DNA which can then insert into other parts of the genome; and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) P-elements, which randomly inserts into the genome to cause mutations in germ line cells, but not in somatic cells.  Mobilome in prokaryotes  Bacterial conjugation. (1) Production of pilus. (2) Pilus connects two bacteria. (3) One strand of plasmid DNA moves into the recipient. (4) Both bacteria contain identical plasmids. Plasmids were discovered in the 1940s as genetic materials outside of bacterial chromosomes. Prophages are genomes of bacteriophages (a type of virus) that are inserted into bacterial chromosomes; prophages can then be spread to other bacteria through the lytic cycle and lysogenic cycle of viral replication. While transposable elements are also found in prokaryotic genomes, the most common mobile genetic elements in the prokaryotic genome are plasmids and prophages. Plasmids and prophages can move between genomesn through bacterial conjugation, allowing horizontal gene transfer. Plasmids often carry genes that are responsible for bacterial antibiotic resistance; as these plasmids replicate and pass from one genome to another, the whole bacterial population can quickly adapt to the antibiotic. Prophages can loop out of bacterial chromosomes to produce bacteriophages that go on to infect other bacteria with the prophages; this allows prophages to propagate quickly among the bacterial population, to the harm of the bacterial host.  Mobilome in viruses  Discovered in 2008 in a strain of Acanthamoeba castellanii mimivirus, virophages are an element of the virus mobilome. Virophages are viruses that replicate only when host cells are co-infected with helper viruses. Following co-infection, helper viruses exploit the host cell's transcription/translation machinery to produce their own machinery; virophages replicate through the machinery of either the host cell or the viruses. The replication of virophages can negatively impact the replication of helper viruses. Sputnik and mavirus are examples of virophages.

Kean served as reeve for the townships of Orillia and Matchedash from 1862 to 1869 and was warden of Simcoe County in 1868. In 1869, with partners, he built a large sawmill at the outlet of the Hogg River at Victoria Harbour. In 1880, he was sent by the Canadian government to the Fort Macleod area where he built a number of sawmills, including one on Pincher Creek. He later worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway.

His music has been preserved, like other Sorkočević family possessions, in the archives of the Dubrovnik Franciscan convent. He is known as the first Croatian symphonist. Biography Luka (Lukša) Sorkočević was born in Dubrovnik and received an extensive education. His music teacher was the Italian composer Giuseppe Valenti, who was maestro di cappella of Dubrovnik Cathedral in the 1750s. He continued his education in Rome where he studied musical composition with Rinaldo di Capua. Later, Sorkočević married a girl from the Luccari (Lukarević) family and held several posts in various branches of Dubrovnik politics and society. During his relatively brief stint in Vienna as the ambassador to the imperial court he met several leading composers of his time, like Gluck and Haydn, and the famous poet Metastasio – a valuable experience for his later life and work. With serious health problems, he committed suicide by throwing himself from the third floor of his palace in Dubrovnik in 1789, at the age of 55. Although he also wrote a few vocal pieces, his most interesting works are the eight symphonies, the violin sonata and the overture trio for the flute. These instrumental works belong to the transitional period between baroque and classicism. They can neither be associated with the empfindsamer Stil – indicated by the fact that they are exclusively written in major keys – nor with the modernism of the Mannheim school. Nevertheless, Sorkočević's music contains traces of both styles. The Largo of the Symphony No. 7 shows the kind of expression which is associated with the Empfindsamkeit and the first movement of the Symphony No. 1 contains the crescendi for which the Mannheim school was famous. The Sonata in A-major for piano was written in 1754.

Also featured is a cover of The Knack song \\"My Sharona\\". Recording and production Recording for Cracked Brain first started in 1989 but came to a halt when Destruction fired their vocalist and bassist Schmier. Guitarist Mike Sifringer recalled, \\"We recorded the basic tracks – drums and riff-guitars – at Union-Studios in Munich, a very expensive place. But Schmier was not happy with the music anymore, so what to do? We had to stop the recording session and went back home, everybody was pissed. In hindsight I know we made a wrong decision, we didn't talk enough. We did not meet for years after the split.\\" On the album's recording process, Sifringer said, \\"To save a bit of money we recorded bass and vocals in Berlin at Sky Track.

The game features a three- dimensional game engine and individual modeling of game character behaviors. The game was released in Spain and Italy in December 2006 by FX Interactive under the name Imperium Civitas. The difference in naming is explained by the popularity of Haemimont's previous games, Imperium I, II and III, which sold more than 1 million copies in these countries. In the game, the player assumes the roles of city planner, governor, and military leader. Successful players will need planning skills, economic savvy, and—should those fail—military might. The glory of the Roman Empire will challenge gamers to grow a small village into a thriving community through trade with neighbors, while also expanding and defending its borders through more militaristic means. Players will need to focus on the physical and emotional health of the citizenry; as villagers age and mature under strong leadership, they contribute to the development of more advanced societies and larger cities. A demo was released by Haemimont games on June 14, 2006, and a sequel - Imperium Romanum - was released in 2008.  Scenarios  Glory of the Roman Empire: Missions take place in Florentia (5 missions), Pompeii (1 mission), Syracusae (4 missions), Toletum (3 missions), Kartagena (3 missions), Massilia (2 missions), Mediolanum (2 missions), Lugdunum (2 missions), Londinium (3 missions), and Colonia Claudia (3 missions) There are seven more scenarios that are sandboxes: Mountain Paradise, Desert, Highlander, Across the river, Mamertum, Halkedonia, and Rome. It also has a challenge mode where the player has to achieve random goals for 4 different cities. Imperium Civitas: (Spanish and Italian edition) There are two campaigns instead of one as in Glory of the Roman Empire. A military campaign and a peaceful campaign. There are 12 freebuild cities: Burdigala, Colonia Agrippina, Syena, Andautonia, Roma, Geneva, Venetia, Tamiatis, Labacum, Antium, Salamantica, and Emerita Augusta In the challenge mode the player can choose from Londinium, Lutetia, Colonia Agrippina, Burdigala, Lugdunum, Mediolanum, Andautonia, Tarraco, Carthago Nova, Tingis, Caralis, Carthago, Syracusae, Pompeii, and Roma.

It is one of seven Quaker schools in England. The school is based in the Mendip Hills near the village of Winscombe, Somerset and caters for children between the ages of 3 and 18. Children aged from 3 to 11 are educated in Sidcot Junior School, which is located on its own site adjacent to the main campus. About 130 of the school's 525 pupils (2010) are in this junior school. In the senior school, nearly half of the 395 pupils are boarders. Over 29 different countries are represented making up 25% of the school. Boarders board in the grounds in one of the 6 boarding houses. The girls' houses are Newcombe, School House Girls and Meadowside, and the boys' are School House Boys and Wing House. Although a Quaker School, pupils come from a variety of different faiths and cultures. All pupils are expected to join in with a short Meeting for Worship every Friday morning instead of assembly. Prior to September 2013, Sidcot school operated a 3 house system named after explorers: Nansen, Shackleton and Rhodes. A new House system was introduced at the beginning of the 2013 Autumn term.Changes for September 2013 There are four houses in the revised house system named after the cardinal points of the compass: North, East, South and West, each house has a colour: Blue,Yellow, Green and Red respectively. The houses are mainly used for sports days and house matches of sport. One of the principal aims behind the new system is to allow greater interaction between students in the Senior and Junior Schools. The introduction of House Assemblies at points in the term facilitates students to work together within their Houses. All staff are aligned to a House and given the opportunity to participate in its life as well as support House events. In addition to its sports centre that houses a 25m pool and equestrian facilities, Sidcot has built a new creative arts block, with extensive drama, art and music facilities, which opened in June 2009. It is open to the public for exhibitions, courses and workshops. Many past pupils and teachers are members of the Sidcotians (Alumni Network).Sidcotians History The first Quaker school was established at Winscombe in 1699 to teach boys of Quaker families. The current school reopened in 1808 and welcomed girls, making Sidcot one of the oldest co-educational boarding schools in the UK - although it wasn’t until the late 1800s that they were all taught together for the first time. Carnegie Medal shadowing scheme Since 2003, Sidcot has participated in the CILIP Carnegie Medal and Kate Greenaway Medal book awards shadowing scheme. This year has been very successful, with all of the Year 9 higher set participating. Uniform The school uniform is predominantly navy blue. All pupils must wear a blue and white striped shirt and blazer (both of which sport the school's logo of a ship) until 6.30 pm from Monday to Friday. Boys must wear ties, and after the recent bi-centenary celebrations boys have two tie options. Sixth form must wear 'smart-casual' clothing and on Monday 'interview smart' suits. School logo The school logo has recently been changed. The ship, because of its historical significance as the logo for many years has been retained, but is now shown forging through the waves. The current colour palette has been built on the school's traditional blue.
