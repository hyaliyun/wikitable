The Lengyel culture is an archaeological culture of the European Neolithic, centered on the Middle Danube in Central Europe. It flourished during 5000-3400 BC. The eponymous type site is at Lengyel in Tolna county, Hungary. It was preceded by the Linear Pottery culture and succeeded by the Corded Ware culture. In its northern extent, overlapped the somewhat later but otherwise approximately contemporaneous Funnelbeaker culture. Also closely related are the Stroke-ornamented ware and R√∂ssen cultures, adjacent to the north and west, respectively. Subgroups of the Lengyel horizon include the Austrian/Moravian Painted Ware I and II, Aichb√ºhl, Jordan√≥w/Jordanov/Jordansm√ºhl, Schussenried, Gatersleben, etc. It is a wide interaction sphere or cultural horizon rather than an archaeological culture in the narrow sense. Its distribution overlaps with the Tisza culture and with Stroke-Ornamented Pottery (STK) as far north as Os≈Çonki, central Poland. Lengyel pottery was found in western Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Austria, Poland, and in the Sopot culture of the northern parts of Former Yugoslavia. Influence in pottery styles is found even further afield, in parts of Germany and Switzerland. Agriculture and stock raising (mainly cattle, but also pigs, and to a lesser extent, ovicaprids) was practiced, though many wild faunal remains have also been recovered. Settlements consisted of small houses as well as trapezoid longhouses. These settlements were sometimes open, sometimes surrounded by a defensive ditch. Inhumation was in separate cemeteries, in the flexed position with apparently no preference for which side the deceased was laid out in. Lengyel sites of the later period show signs of the use of copper in form of beads and hammered ribbons, marking the dawn of the Chalcholithic period in Central Europe. It was associated with the cover-term Old Europe by Marija Gimbutas, though may have been undergone \\"kurganization\\" by the Proto-Indo-Europeans and become integrated into the successor Globular Amphora culture. Genetics In a 2017 genetic study published in Nature, the remains of nine individuals ascribed to the Lengyel culture was analyzed. Of the nine samples of Y-DNA extracted, two belonged to H, one belonged to H1b1, one belonged to I, one belonged to I2, one belonged to G2a2a1, one belonged to J2a, one belonged to C, and one belonged to E1b1b1a1b1. mtDNA extracted were various subclades of U, N, T, H, J, W.

The attack works by forcing legitimate MAC table contents out of the switch and forcing a unicast flooding behavior potentially sending sensitive information to portions of the network where it is not normally intended to go. Attack method Switches maintain a MAC table that maps individual MAC addresses on the network to the physical ports on the switch. This allows the switch to direct data out of the physical port where the recipient is located, as opposed to indiscriminately broadcasting the data out of all ports as an Ethernet hub does. The advantage of this method is that data is bridged exclusively to the network segment containing the computer that the data is specifically destined for. In a typical MAC flooding attack, a switch is fed many Ethernet frames, each containing different source MAC addresses, by the attacker. The intention is to consume the limited memory set aside in the switch to store the MAC address table. The effect of this attack may vary across implementations, however the desired effect (by the attacker) is to force legitimate MAC addresses out of the MAC address table, causing significant quantities of incoming frames to be flooded out on all ports. It is from this flooding behavior that the MAC flooding attack gets its name. After launching a successful MAC flooding attack, a malicious user can use a packet analyzer to capture sensitive data being transmitted between other computers, which would not be accessible were the switch operating normally. The attacker may also follow up with an ARP spoofing attack which will allow them to retain access to privileged data after switches recover from the initial MAC flooding attack. MAC flooding can also be used as a rudimentary VLAN hopping attack. Counter measures To prevent MAC flooding attacks, network operators usually rely on the presence of one or more features in their network equipment: * With a feature often called \\"port security\\" by vendors, many advanced switches can be configured to limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned on ports connected to end stations. A smaller table of secure MAC addresses is maintained in addition to (and as a subset to) the traditional MAC address table. * Many vendors allow discovered MAC addresses to be authenticated against an authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) server and subsequently filtered. * Implementations of IEEE 802.1X suites often allow packet filtering rules to be installed explicitly by an AAA server based on dynamically learned information about clients, including the MAC address. * Security features to prevent ARP spoofing or IP address spoofing in some cases may also perform additional MAC address filtering on unicast packets, however this is an implementation-dependent side-effect. * Additional security measures are sometimes applied along with the above to prevent normal unicast flooding for unknown MAC addresses. This feature usually relies on the \\"port security\\" feature to retain all secure MAC addresses for at least as long as they remain in the ARP table of layer 3 devices. Hence, the aging time of learned secure MAC addresses is separately adjustable. This feature prevents packets from flooding under normal operational circumstances, as well as mitigating the effects of a MAC flood attack.

It is located in Rajshahi. It is affiliated with Rajshahi University. It was the second such institution in erstwhile East Pakistan after Dhaka Medical College. It has a large hospital that is the central provider for advanced health care in the northern part of Bangladesh. History After the separation of East Bengal from India in 1947 the people of Rajshahi region were deprived of medical education and healthcare facilities. In 1949 some renowned persons of civil society and political persons involved in administration took initiative to establish a private medical school in Rajshahi city. Initially they launched LMF (Licentiate of Medical Faculty) diploma course under State Medical Faculty Dhaka. Eighty students were admitted in the first batch. In 1954, erstwhile Pakistan government converted it to government medical college. In 1958, it was launched as a complete college. It is the first medical college in northern part of Bangladesh. The first head of department of Anatomy and Physiology were respectively Lieutenant Colonel Gias Uddin Ahmed who was the first principal of this college and Professor Dr. Nayeb Ali. There were 43 students in the first batch including 2 female students and only 5 college staffs. The college and hospital premises are set up on 90 acres of land. The three storied 530 bed hospital was built in 1965 which included medicine, surgery and gynaecology-obstetrics Department. This hospital premises stands on 60 acres of land which was agricultural farm before. 20 bed Infectious disease hospital, leprosy control centre and 150 bed Sadar hospital were affiliated with this hospital. Henceforth, Sadar hospital was converted to dental unit. At present MBBS, BDS and postgraduate course on different subjects are running in this college. BDS course was launched in 1992 and postgraduate course in 1998. General Medical Council of Great Britain recognised this medical college on 1 July 1992. Many doctors and students of this college participated in independence war of Bangladesh in 1971. A Shahid Minar was built in front of administrative building in 1974. College infrastructure Dr. Kaisar Rahman Chowdhury Auditorium, Rajshahi Medical College There are four galleries with computer multimedia projector, nine laboratories, two museums, two dissection rooms, one autopsy room, one library and two common rooms for students. A new pharmacology building was built to the east side of the main premises in 1990. To the east of this building, a magnificent, modern, sophisticated auditorium was built in 1995 which is air-conditioned and contains 1000 seats. It is known as Kaisar Rahman Chowdhury Auditorium. A new building for forensic medicine has been built recently to north-east side of the main building. It was launched in 2010. Besides, there is a nursing institute in the college premises. In the college library, there are approximately 19500 books including both new and old editions and 60 medical journals of both home and abroad. Medical education unit of library provides with all modern facilities with internet browsing. The Research cell of college helps both students and doctors in research. The teacher's organisation of Rajshahi medical college publishes a bi-annual medical journal named 'TAJ' which is recognised by BMDC. There are two hostels for male students. They are Shahid Muktijuddha Kaji Nurunnobbi hostel and Shahid Shah Mainul Ahsan Pinku hostel. Polin, Falguni and Ayesha Siddiqa are for female. Ayesha Siddiqa hostel was inaugurated in 2006. Shahid Jamil Akhtar Raton hostel is for male and another one for female internee doctors. There is a college bus for students which ply on different route of the city regularly. A canteen was opened firstly beside hospital kitchen which was shifted to the north side of pathology department in a tin shed room in 1963. Henceforth, in 1982 a brick-built one storied building was built instead of tin shed room. This canteen is now well known as \\"Charu Mamar Canteen\\". Moreover, another new canteen was launched beside Pinku hostel in 2006. Hospital infrastructure The three storied hospital building with 530 beds was launched in April 1965. Another new four storied building has been built in an empty space at the centre of main building which was inaugurated in 2012. The new building will provide 352 new beds, 6 operation theatres, one power substation and corridors to other buildings. It has a foundation of 10 stories. With this new building RMCH has now 862 beds. To the north side of Operation Theater a building has been built for 10 bed ICU in 2012, moreover a burn unit and plastic surgery department was inaugurated in 2014 at the same building. Coronary care unit was set up in 1984. In 1990 this unit was modernised to open Cardiology department. In 2014 cardiology ward was extended and shifted to newly built four storied building. Coronary angiogram and pacemaker implantation are performed here regularly since 2007. Nephrology and Neurosurgery department was set up in 1991. Hemodialysis is being done here since 2004. Paediatric surgery and Neuromedicine department was launched respectively in 1993 and 1994. Cobalt-60 machine is available since 1996 for cancer treatment. Nuclear medicine department was set up here in 1969. OCC centre was opened in this hospital in 2002 to give medical and legal help to the oppressed women. CT scan and MRI have been launched in Radiology and Imaging department in 2005. Endoscopy and colonoscopy are done here since 2007. BDS course was launched here as dental unit in 1992. Nine students were admitted in first batch. New building has been built for dental college in old Sadar hospital. A decision to establish a dental college is in the cards.

During the recording of their seminal fourth album Jane Doe, the group became a four- piece with the departure of guitarist Aaron Dalbec and the addition of bassist Nate Newton and drummer Ben Koller. This lineup has remained intact since. They have released nine studio albums, three live albums, and numerous EPs. The band's sound is rooted in both hardcore punk and heavy metal, and they are considered pioneers of metalcore as well as its subgenre mathcore. Converge have enjoyed a relatively high level of recognition. According to AllMusic, they are \\"regarded as one of the most original and innovative bands to emerge from the punk underground.\\"Stacia Proefrock. Converge Biography. AllMusic Their popularity rose with the release of Jane Doe, which was ranked as the best album of the decade by Sputnikmusic, the best album of 2001 by Terrorizer and later as the 61st best metal album of all time by Rolling Stone. Subsequently, Converge moved from Equal Vision Records to the considerably larger label Epitaph Records and their records gradually became more elaborate and expensive to produce. Special releases have traditionally been handled by Deathwish Inc., established by Bannon in 1999. The band's ninth studio album, The Dusk in Us, was released in November 2017 through Deathwish and Epitaph. History Early years and Halo in a Haystack (1990‚Äì1994) = Converge was formed in the winter of 1990 by Bannon and Ballou, they were later joined by high school friends Jeff Feinberg and Damon Bellorado in 1991. They started by playing covers of hardcore punk, punk rock and heavy metal songs. The band soon graduated to playing live performances in mid-1991, after recording some demos on a 4-track recorder. The band started writing and playing what they consider \\"relevant\\" music in 1994. In 1994 the band became a five piece when Dalbec was recruited as a second guitarist. Later in the year Converge released their debut album, Halo in a Haystack, released through Earthmaker Records. This was only released as a vinyl record and was limited to 1000 copies. The album has not been reprinted since its release. The record was funded by Bannon through money he saved up from working at a nursing home. =Petitioning the Empty Sky, When Forever Comes Crashing and line-up changes (1995‚Äì1999)= Kurt Ballou in 2007 In 1995 Converge released their first compilation album, Caring and Killing. The album featured tracks from the band's early work from the years 1991 to 1994. The album was originally released as a European exclusive through Lost & Found Records. However, Converge became dissatisfied with the way the label was handling the release and overcharging fans for their hard-to-find older songs. The album was re- released through Hydra Head Records on November 17, 1997 in America to \\"make an overpriced release obsolete\\". In 1996 Converge released a four-song EP, Petitioning the Empty Sky. It was released through Ferret Music, and was one of the earliest releases through the newly-formed label. Later that same year the record was re-released with four additional new tracks. Two years later, the record was reissued through Converge's new label Equal Vision Records on January 20, 1998. This version contained the previous eight tracks as well as three newly added live tracks, recorded during a radio broadcast. Due to the addition of the new tracks, fans and sources consider this to be Converge's second studio album, while the band considers it a compilation album because it is a collection of songs recorded at different times. In early 1997 the band's original bassist, Feinburg, left the band, and was replaced with Stephen Brodsky. Also that year, the band signed to Equal Vision Records. On December 22, 1997, recording for the band's third studio album When Forever Comes Crashing began at Ballou's GodCity Studio; it finished on January 3, 1998. On April 14, 1998 Converge released When Forever Comes Crashing through Equal Vision. In 1998, Brodsky left the band and was replaced by Newton, who initially joined the band as a part-time member while he was still active in another band, Jesuit. Jesuit later disbanded in 1999, allowing Newton to make Converge his main focus. In early 1999, the original drummer Bellorado left the band and was quickly replaced with John DiGiorgio, who also left the band in the same year. Koller joined Converge in late 1999, replacing DiGiorgio. Ballou selected Koller to temporarily fill in while Converge searched for a more permanent replacement for Bellorado, as he was familiar with his work in previous bands, Force Fed Glass and Blue/Green Heart, a band that Ballou and Koller played in together. After working well with the band during some local shows in Boston, Converge made him an official member. Newton and Koller remain in the band to this day. = Jane Doe (2000‚Äì2003) = Jacob Bannon performing in 2018 In mid-2000 Converge self-released a three-track demo record titled Jane Doe Demos. This was released on tour and was limited to 100 copies. It contained unreleased demo versions of \\"Bitter & Then Some\\" and \\"Thaw\\" from their upcoming album Jane Doe. Converge entered the studio to begin recording in the summer of 2001. On September 4, 2001, Converge released their fourth studio album, Jane Doe. It was met with immediate critical acclaim, with critics praising its poetic lyrics, dynamic range, ferocity and production. The album was a commercial success in comparison to Converge's previous outings, and both the band and the album have developed a cult following since its release. It is the band's first studio album to feature Newton and Koller, and the last to feature Dalbec, who was asked to leave the band due to his devotion to his side project Bane. Converge's first tour in support of Jane Doe was in September, 2001 with Drowningman and Playing Enemy, however Drowningman later dropped out of the tour to work on a new album. In 2002 a music video was released for the track/tracks \\"Concubine/Fault and Fracture\\" from the album Jane Doe; the music video was directed by Zach Merck. On January 28, 2003 Converge released their second compilation album, Unloved and Weeded Out. The album was originally released as a three track EP in 1995. The 2003 album version contains all three tracks from the 1995 EP but in total features 14 tracks, some of which were previously released rarities while others were previously unreleased. On February 25, 2003 Converge released their first official DVD, The Long Road Home. It is modeled after band home videos such as Metallica's Cliff 'Em All. Deathwish Inc describes the DVD as a \\"two disc collection that is as energetic and exciting as the moments the release captures\\". The DVD also comes with a bonus disk that included three full live sets from the band. = You Fail Me and No Heroes (2004‚Äì2007) = In early 2004 the band announced that they were signing to Epitaph Records, having previously been signed to Equal Vision. Bannon stated, \\"We are confident as artists and genuinely happy about the move. We are part of a diverse, quality roster with Epitaph, rich in both history and integrity. We've struggled for years looking for a supportive label to call home and after a decade we have found it.\\" Converge began writing for You Fail Me after they recorded Jane Doe; they wrote on the road during sound checks of shows. Converge entered the studio to begin recording in March 2004 mainly at GodCity Studio. On September 20, 2004 Converge released their fifth studio album, You Fail Me. It was the band's first to chart commercially, reaching number 171 on the Billboard 200. On February 14, 2005 a music video was released for the track \\"Eagles Become Vultures\\", directed by Zach Merck. Converge's first tour in support of You Fail Me started in September 2004 with Cave In and Between the Buried and Me. In 2005 Equal Vision reissued Petitioning the Empty Sky and When Forever Comes Crashing. These reissues gave the albums one new bonus track each; Petitioning the Empty Sky received an alternate version of the song \\"Love as Arson\\" and When Forever Comes Crashing received a demo version of the song \\"Bitter and Then Some\\". These reissues also came with new album artwork by Aaron Turner of Isis. Ballou said in an interview that he wanted to remix and remaster the albums because the quality of Converge's recordings had improved so much that the original recordings were \\"becoming distracting\\". These reissues became the standard versions of these albums. In early July, 2006 Converge's official website announced the title of their upcoming album, No Heroes, as well as the meaning behind it: \\"These days, cowards outnumber the heroes, and the begging souls outweigh the calloused hands of the hardest of workers. Both in life and in art, the lack of passion is sickening, and the lust for complacency is poisonous. This album is the artistic antithesis of that sinking world; a thorn in the side of their beast. It's for those who move mountains one day at a time. It's for those who truly understand sacrifice. In our world of enemies, we will walk alone...\\" On October 24, 2006 Converge released their sixth studio album, No Heroes. This was the first Converge album to be self-produced by Ballou with no input from other producers, at his own GodCity Studio. The same day as the album's release, Converge released a music video for the title track, directed by Ryan Zunkley. Converge's first tour in support of No Heroes started in November 2006 with Some Girls, Modern Life Is War, Blacklisted, Kylesa and Gospel. Despite their growing prominence, Converge continued to appear at small independent events such as Fluff Fest in the Czech Republic, which they played in 2007. = Axe to Fall (2008-2011) = Nate Newton in 2007 In November 2008 Converge began writing Axe to Fall. Following a short tour in March 2009 with Ceremony, Coliseum, Pulling Teeth and Rise and Fall, Converge entered the studio to begin recording in May 2009. During this short tour, the band debuted a few new songs live, and footage could be seen online. The album was produced by Ballou, at GodCity Studio. In August 2009, two months prior to the release of Axe to Fall, Converge made the opening track, \\"Dark Horse\\", available for streaming and as a free download. It was noted for being one of the few tracks lacking guest musicians, and was met with a very positive reaction from reviewers. The title track was also made available for free download in September 2009. The entire album was available for streaming on Converge's MySpace page one week before the official release date. On October 14, 2009, a music video was released for the title track of the album, directed by Craig Murray. On October 20, 2009 Converge released their seventh studio album, Axe to Fall. On November 7, the \\"Axe to Fall\\" video debuted on MTV2's heavy metal music program, Headbangers Ball. Converge's first tour in support of Axe to Fall was the Metalocalypse tour in late 2009, sponsored by Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. Alongside High on Fire, Converge held an opening slot for co- headliners Mastodon and Dethklok. Converge's first headlining tour in support of the album started in April 2010 with Coalesce, Harvey Milk, Gaza, Lewd Acts and Black Breath. Converge began the European part of their world tour in July 2010 with Kylesa, Gaza and Kvelertak. In July 2010 the band released a limited-edition 7-inch vinyl single, On My Shield. It was released in three different colors, with each limited to 1,000 copies. One version was sold during Converge's 2010 European tours, one was sold through the band's Epitaph web store, and the final version was distributed to various vinyl retailers. =All We Love We Leave Behind (2012‚Äì2016)= Ben Koller in 2018 In January 2012 Converge completed writing for their eighth studio album, All We Love We Leave Behind. The following day, Ballou announced plans via his Facebook page to begin recording with the band in January. On August 28, 2012 a music video was released for the track \\"Aimless Arrow\\" from the upcoming album, directed by Max Moore. On the same day, Converge revealed the album's artwork, depicting a lunar cycle. On October 3, 2012, the album was available to stream in its entirety on YouTube, a week before its official release. On October 9, 2012 Converge released their eighth studio album, All We Love We Leave Behind. It peaked at number 70 on the Billboard 200, surpassing Axe to Fall in terms of commercial success. Converge's first headlining tour in support of All We Love We Leave Behind started in October 2012 with Torche, Kvelertak, Nails and Whips/Chains. On April 17, 2014 another music video was released for the track \\"Precipice / All We Love We Leave Behind\\", directed by Craig Murray. On October 15, 2015 Deathwish's YouTube channel released a trailer for Converge's Blu-ray set, Thousands of Miles Between Us. This was released on November 27, 2015. The set was described by Deathwish as the long-awaited sequel to their landmark 2003 DVD release, The Long Road Home. The footage includes a full 20-song Converge set and over 15 hours of live, rare, and previously unseen footage, which is claimed to span over a decade in the life of the band. On April 29, 2016 Converge announced plans to reissue the album You Fail Me (12 years after the original release); it was made available for pre-order the same day. On May 2, 2016 the title track from the upcoming version of the album was made available to stream on SoundCloud. On June 17, 2016 Converge reissued the album under the name You Fail Me Redux through Epitaph and Deathwish. Ballou remixed the album and Alan Douches remastered it. The album was also repackaged by Bannon. Ballou explained in an interview with Noisey that after he recorded and mixed the album No Heroes, he wanted to go back and remix You Fail Me, because he and the rest of the band were \\"never quite content with the original mix\\". = The Dusk In Us and Beautiful Ruin (2017‚Äìpresent) = On January 16, 2017 the band announced they would release a live album of their Jane Doe set from the Netherlands Roadburn Festival in 2016, titled Jane Live. The album was put up for pre-order the same day. Deathwish's SoundCloud put the live version of the track \\"Jane Doe\\" up for streaming. Jane Live was released on March 3, 2017. Koller announced during an interview that the band was planning to start tracking for a new album in the spring of 2017. Following their tour on April 8, Converge planned to promptly head into the studio to record their next album. On May 27, 2017 DigBoston published an interview with the band's vocalist Jacob Bannon, who revealed that the band had 18 songs already written. He stated the album is \\"very powerful\\" and will be a \\"progression of something [they] did previously.\\" On July 25, 2017 Converge released the single \\"I Can Tell You About Pain\\", accompanied by a video directed by Tony Wolski. The single also contained the non-album track ‚ÄúEve‚Äù as a b-side. On August 15, Converge released the new track \\"Under Duress\\", available for streaming. It was described by Bannon as his \\"emotional reaction to the complex world in which we live\\". With the announcement of the song, the album's tracklist and cover art were revealed. The band toured in Europe in August 2017 prior to the release. The following month another track, ‚ÄúReptilian‚Äù, was made available for streaming. \\"A Single Tear\\" was made available for streaming on October 31, accompanied by a video directed by Max Moore. The video was described by having \\"heavy with symbolism about parenthood and connection.\\" The Dusk in Us was released in the through Epitaph and Deathwish on November 3, 2017. On June 28, 2018, the band uploaded a short series of images to their Instagram page, alluding to a new release. On June 29, the band released the Beautiful Ruin EP via Epitaph and Deathwish, along with a music video for the song \\"Melancholia\\", directed by Tony Wolski. The EP consists of four tracks recorded during the sessions for The Dusk in Us which did not make the cut.  Artistry  Musical style and influences = Converge's music is rooted in both hardcore punk and heavy metal and they are considered one of the earliest and most influential metalcore bands. Their sound has also been described as mathcore, post-hardcore, noisecore,Kevin Stewart-Panko, \\"The Decade in Noisecore\\", Terrorizer no. 75, Feb 2000, p. 22-23. experimental hardcore, or simply hardcore. AllMusic describes them as a \\"revered punk metal band that combined the aggression of hardcore and metal with the complexity and polyrhythms of jazz.\\" Their 2001 album Jane Doe, which has become their most acclaimed work, introduced an experimental approach and emphasis on rhythmical complexity, which are defining features of mathcore. However Bannon has stated: \\"I really don't know what mathcore is. Converge is an aggressive band. We have elements of hardcore, punk, and metal for sure. But I think trying to define our efforts and other bands with a generic subgenre name is counter productive. We all have something unique to offer and should be celebrated for those qualities rather than having them generalized for easy consumption.\\" Converge started writing and playing what they consider \\"relevant\\" music in 1994. At that time they started incorporating influences like Starkweather, The Acc√ºsed, Rorschach, Born Against, Moss Icon, Universal Order of Armageddon, Heroin, and Mohinder into their approach. In a 2012 interview, Bannon told Jonny Cohn of The Aquarian that the band \\"don‚Äôt really look to any outside influences all that much anymore. We kind of haven‚Äôt for a long time. We have been a band for over two decades. We‚Äôre more introverted. We‚Äôre used to writing and creating in our own little bubble. We love and appreciate all different kinds of music and at times you can hear little subtle things come out but for the most part, they‚Äôre just an extension and exploration of things that we‚Äôve done in the past.\\" Kurt Ballou has produced (and co-produced) the majority of Converge's albums at his own GodCity Studio. He has always been involved in the production of Converge's albums, but it was not until their 2006 album, No Heroes, that he was involved in the entire recording and mixing process. This became the standard for Converge releases afterwards. One reason Ballou claimed to get into the studio side of music was to have \\"maximum control over our music\\". He stated, \\"When we were starting out, no one wanted to help us anyway, so if we didn't take control, nothing was going to get done.\\" = Lyrics and vocal delivery = Scott Butterworth of Noisey has described Bannon's vocals \\"as just another sonic element‚Äîmore percussive and tonal than lyrical‚Äîallowing listeners to develop an emotional understanding of the material even without a precise knowledge of the words.\\" Sammy O'Hagar of Metalsucks stated Bannon's vocals \\"[are] as much a part of Converge's uniqueness as is Ballou's nimble riffing\\". = Artwork = Bannon has designed all of Converge's artwork since their 1996 release, Petitioning the Empty Sky. Although reissues of older albums have had artwork done by Aaron Turner such as the 2005 reissues of Petitioning the Empty Sky and When Forever Comes Crashing, Bannon still took part in the design process of these reissues. In an interview with Revolver, Bannon shared his art process, saying, \\"When I work I usually start out with a sketch of some kind, either in my process book or on a scrap of paper,\\" he explains. \\"I also did this with the Jane Doe album. By doing that, I work through ideas, write about them, and force them to evolve into something more refined. Process is extremely important for me--it allows me to have a log of my ideas, whether they're successful or not. That said, I sketched the basic cover and started building it in layers, using acrylic, ink, and spray paint. Because of the nature of the work and the need for flexibility in the imagery, I decided to build it in physical layers and scan certain elements for future use.\\" Since the release of Converge's 2001 album Jane Doe, the cover art of the woman simply known as \\"Jane\\" has become Converge's icon, in a similar vain to Iron Maiden's Eddie or Mot√∂rhead's Snaggletooth. Collaborations Converge have collaborated with numerous musicians throughout their work such as members of Cave In, The Hope Conspiracy, Genghis Tron, Neurosis and Disfear. Most of these bands are featured on the band's collaborative album Axe to Fall. However, with the exception of Axe to Fall, Converge tend not to include many guests on their albums, and the guests that are included have minor roles such as backing vocals. The band have also worked with Tomas Lindberg (of At the Gates, Skitsystem, The Great Deceiver, and Disfear), Aaron Turner (of Isis and Old Man Gloom), and Kevin Baker (of All Pigs Must Die and The Hope Conspiracy), all of whom provided vocals for a cover of Entombed's \\"Wolverine Blues\\" performed by Converge. =With Cave In= Cave In and Converge have collaborated numerous times. Brodsky had been the bassist of Converge from 1997 to 1998. Ballou produced Cave In's first two records, Beyond Hypothermia and Until Your Heart Stops. Koller became a temporary drummer for Cave In during their support tour of their fourth studio album, Perfect Pitch Black. Cave In also recorded two songs with Koller, \\"Dead Already\\" and \\"Shapeshifter\\"; these songs were released together on a limited-edition cassette single. In 2016, Brodsky was featured as a special guest for Converge's Blood Moon performances. Bands that feature both members of Cave In and Converge include Kid Kilowatt, Old Man Gloom, Doomriders, Mutoid Man and Bannon's Wear Your Wounds live band. The relationship between the two bands has been described as \\"incestuous\\" by members of each band. The bands even went as far to joke with each other about hosting a festival titled \\"IncestFest\\", which would only feature bands and side-projects that are related to Cave In and Converge. Cave In performing at the Backstage Club in Munich, 2006 After touring together in 2004, every member of Cave In and Converge entered Ballou's GodCity Studio to lay the foundation for what was intended to become a full-length collaborative album between the two bands. Tentatively dubbed the \\"Verge-In\\" sessions (an amalgamation of the bands' names), the project was described as sounding \\"like this freaky mix of Ride the Lightning-era Metallica meets Mars Volta meets the Allman Brothers.\\" Due to both groups growing busier with their primary bands, as well as creative differences, the project eventually fizzled out. Brodsky described the sessions as being a \\"bigger project than anyone had anticipated taking on... The idea was to put out some sort of release at some point. But as with anything that has too many cooks in the kitchen, the project got delayed, and certain people felt one way or another about the pieces we came up with, and in the end, there was a very small portion of material that everyone could agree on.\\" Tracks from the abandoned Verge-In sessions were reworked and transformed years later into the Converge songs \\"Plagues\\" from No Heroes' and \\"Effigy\\", \\"Cruel Bloom\\", and \\"Wretched World\\" from Axe to Fall, the latter of which were heavily reworked by members of Genghis Tron. Bannon said he believes there are only two unused and half-finished tracks from these sessions that could end up being reworked into new Cave In songs down the road. Brodsky said what became \\"Effigy\\" was some of the best material from the sessions and expressed interest in going back and finishing the remaining unreleased tracks at some point. = Blood Moon = 225x225px In April 2016, all four members of Converge, and guests Chelsea Wolfe, Ben Chisholm also of Chelsea Wolfe, Stephen Brodsky of Cave In and Steve Von Till of Neurosis, collaborated for four limited European performances titled Blood Moon. The collective performed \\"ambient/post-rock interpretations\\" of various tracks from Converge's discography, particularly their \\"lesser-heard and slower work.\\" The first Blood Moon set took place at Postbahnhof in Berlin on April 11. The second took place at La Cartonnerie in Reims on April 12. The third took place at Electric Brixton in London on April 13. The fourth and final Blood Moon show took place after a special one-off Converge set where they played their 2001 album Jane Doe in its entirety for the first and presumably last time, to celebrate its 15-year anniversary. This took place at the Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands on April 14. The following Blood Moon set took place at Roadburn on April 16. In Tom Hartley of NME's review of their London performance, he said: \\"As one of only four European cities visited by Converge on this tour, it felt truly fortunate to witness such a unique show and once again reaffirmed they are crushingly brilliant with whatever they choose to do.\\" In Kim Kelly of Noisey's review of Blood Moon's Roadburn Festival performance, she said: \\"I hadn't realized Converge's Jacob Bannon had such a powerful clean voice, or just how well it would mesh with Chelsea Wolfe's; I stood rooted to the spot for a good half hour if not more, totally sucked in by what was happening onstage. It was obvious that the musicians involved had put a lot of thought into what they were presenting up there.\\" Members ;Current * Jacob Bannon ‚Äì lead vocals (1990‚Äìpresent) * Kurt Ballou ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (1990‚Äìpresent) * Nate Newton ‚Äì bass, vocals (1998‚Äìpresent) * Ben Koller ‚Äì drums (1999‚Äìpresent) ;Touring * Urian Hackney - drums (2019) ;Former * Jeff Feinburg ‚Äì bass, guitars (1991‚Äì1997) * Damon Bellorado ‚Äì drums (1991‚Äì1999) * Aaron Dalbec ‚Äì guitars (1994‚Äì2001) * Stephen Brodsky ‚Äì bass (1997‚Äì1998) * John DiGiorgio ‚Äì drums (1999) ;Session musicians * Erik Ralston ‚Äì bass (1993) = Timeline =Discography ;Studio albums * Halo in a Haystack (1994) * Petitioning the Empty Sky (1996) * When Forever Comes Crashing (1998) * Jane Doe (2001) * You Fail Me (2004) * No Heroes (2006) * Axe to Fall (2009) * All We Love We Leave Behind (2012) * The Dusk in Us (2017) ReferencesExternal links * * Category:American metalcore musical groups Category:American mathcore musical groups Category:American post-hardcore musical groups Category:Hardcore punk groups from Massachusetts Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Massachusetts Category:Punk rock groups from Massachusetts Category:1990 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Musical groups established in 1990 Category:Epitaph Records artists Category:Equal Vision Records artists Category:Deathwish Inc. artists ","title":"Converge (band)"},{"id":"1636124","text":"right A Moviola () is a device that allows a film editor to view a film while editing. It was the first machine for motion picture editing when it was invented by Iwan Serrurier in 1924. The Moviola company is still in existence and is located in Hollywood where part of the facility is located on one of the original Moviola factory floors. History Iwan Serrurier's original 1917 concept for the Moviola was as a home movie projector to be sold to the general public. The name was derived from the name \\"Victrola\\" since Serrurier thought his invention would do for home movie viewing what the Victrola did for home music listening. However, since the machine cost $600 in 1920 (), very few sold. An editor at Douglas Fairbanks Studios suggested that Iwan should adapt the device for use by film editors. Serrurier did this and the Moviola as an editing device was born in 1924 with the first Moviola being sold to Douglas Fairbanks himself. Ninety-four years later, a framed copy of the original receipt still resides at Moviola, the company, in Hollywood. Many studios quickly adopted the Moviola including Universal Studios, Warner Brothers, Charles Chaplin Studios, Buster Keaton Productions, Mary Pickford, Mack Sennett, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The advent of sound, 65mm and 70mm film, and the need for portable editing equipment during World War II greatly expanded the market for Moviola's products.city-net.com \\"INDUSTRY MOURNS ENTREPRENEUR MARK SERRURIER\\", by Denise Abbott Filmmaker Brad Mays editing his first feature film Stage Fright on an upright Moviola, 1987. Iwan Serrurier's son, Mark Serrurier, took over his father's company in 1946. In 1966, Mark sold Moviola Co. to Magnasync Corporation (a subsidiary of Craig Corporation) of North Hollywood for $3 million. Combining the names, the new name was Magnasync/Moviola Corp. President L. S. Wayman instantly ordered a tripling of production, and the new owners realized their investment in less than two years. Wayman retired in 1981, and Moviola Co. was sold to J&R; Film Co., Inc. in 1984. Usage Moviola logo The Moviola allowed editors to study individual shots in their cutting rooms, thus to determine more precisely where the best cut-point might be. The vertically oriented Moviolas were the standard for film editing in the United States until the 1970s, when horizontal flatbed editor systems became more common. Nevertheless, a few very high-profile filmmakers continue to prefer the Moviola. One such editor is Michael Kahn, who received an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing in 2005 for his work on Steven Spielberg's Munich, which he edited with a Moviola. Kahn eventually convinced Spielberg to use Avid for all his current film work, beginning with The Adventures of Tintin in 2011 and Lincoln in 2012. Awards Mark Serrurier accepted an Academy Award of Merit (Oscar statue) for himself and his father for the Moviola in 1979. There is a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Mark Serrurier because of the Moviola's contribution to Motion Pictures.

A speculative fictional account, it depicts the destruction of Western civilization through Third World mass immigration to France and the West. Almost forty years after its initial publication, the novel returned to the bestseller list in 2011. On its publication, the book received praise from some prominent French literary figures\\"Le camp des saints finit par obtenir une critique imposante, non pas tant par le volume (demeur√© incomparable √† celui que provoque le moindre texte d'une vedette de vari√©t√©s) que par la qualit√© de ses laudateurs. Ils s'appellent Anouilh, Bazin, Cau, Clavel, D√©on, Dutourd, Fourasti√©, Maulnier, Pauwels...\\" \\"arrives trailing clouds of praise from French savants, including Dramatist Jean Anouilh\\" but has been dismissed by both French- and English-language commentators. The novel has been denounced by many for conveying themes of racism, xenophobia, nativism, monoculturalism, and anti-immigration content, and is popular within far-right and white nationalist circles.  Inspiration  Raspail has said his inspiration came while at the French Riviera in 1971, as he was looking out at the Mediterranean. The name of the book comes from a passage in the Book of Revelation (Revelation 20:7‚Äì9) depicting the apocalypse. Satan influences most of the nations of the Earth to gather for one final battle against \\"the camp of the saints,\\" before being defeated for eternity:  Plot  In Calcutta, India, Catholic priests promote the adoption of Indian children by those back in Belgium as a form of charity. When the Belgian government realizes that the number of Indian children raised in Belgium has reached 40,000 in just five years, an emergency policy attempts to halt the migration. Desperate for the chance to send their children to what they call a \\"land of plenty\\", a mob of desperate Indians swarms the consulate. As a Belgian aid worker works through the crowd, an Indian gong farmer known only as \\"the turd eater\\", carrying aloft his monstrously deformed child, begs him to take them back to Europe, to which the worker agrees. The worker and farmer bring the crowd to the docks, where there are hundreds of ships once owned by European powers, now suited only for river traffic. Nevertheless, the crowd boards, and a hundred ships soon leave for Europe; conditions on board are cramped, unsanitary and miserable, with many passengers including children publicly fornicating. As the ships pass \\"the straits of Ceylon\\", helicopters swarm overhead, capturing images of the refugees on board to be published in Europe. Meanwhile, on the Russian Far East, the Soviet troops see masses of Chinese ready to enter Siberia but are reluctant to fight them. As the fleet crosses the Indian Ocean, the political situation in France becomes more charged. At a press conference about the crisis, a French official who offers a speech in praise of the refugees is confronted by a journalist who claims he is merely trying to \\"feed the invaders\\" and demands to know if France will \\"have the courage to stand up to\\" the migrants when they reach France. The official decries this question as morally offensive and threatens to throw the journalist out when he continues to yell. Other journalists seek to inflame tensions between the French and Africans and Arabs already living in the country. Over time, these journalists begin to write that the migrant fleet is on a mission to \\"enrich, cleanse and redeem the Capitalist West\\". At the same time as the fleet is praised by those in Paris, the people of Southern France, terrified of the migrants' arrival, flee to the north. As the fleet approaches the Suez Canal, Egyptian military forces fire a warning shot, causing the fleet to steer south, around the Cape of Good Hope. To the surprise of observers, the apartheid regime of South Africa floats out barges of food and supplies, which the migrants throw overboard. The international press is thrilled, believing the rejection of these supplies to be a political statement against the apartheid South African regime. Western leaders, confident the refugees will accept supplies from their \\"more virtuous\\" nations, organize a supply mission, funded by governments, charities, rock stars and major churches, to meet the refugees off S√£o Tom√©. However, the fleet does not stop for these barges either, and when a worker from the Papal barge attempts to board one of the ships, he is strangled and thrown overboard. The press attempts to contain coverage of the disaster. When the migrants pass through the Strait of Gibraltar, the French president orders troops to the south and addresses the nation of his plan to repel the migrants. However, in the middle of the address, he breaks down, demands the troops simply follow their consciences instead. Most of the troops immediately desert their posts and join the civilians as they flee north, and the south is quickly overrun by the migrants. Some of the last troops to stand their ground take refuge in a small village, along with Calgu√®s, an old man who has chosen to remain at his home, and Hamadura, a Westernized Indian who is terrified of his \\"filthy, brutish\\" countrymen and prides himself on having more in common with whites than Indians. The troops in this village, total of nineteen Frenchmen and one Indian, surrounded by what they deem \\"occupied territory\\", remain the last defense of Western values and \\"Free France\\" against the immigrants. The migrants make their way north, having no desire to assimilate to French culture, but continuing to demand a First World standard of living, even as they flout laws, do not produce, and murder French citizens, such as factory bosses and shopkeepers, as well as the ordinary people who do not welcome them. They are also joined by the immigrants who already reside in Europe, as well as various left-wing and anarchist groups. Across the West, more and more migrants arrive and have children, rapidly growing to outnumber whites. In a matter of months, the white West has been overrun and the pro- immigrant governments are established, while the white people are ordered to share their houses and flats with the immigrants. The village containing the troops is bombed flat by airplanes of the new French government, referred to only as the \\"Paris Multiracial Commune\\". Within a few years, most Western governments have surrendered. The mayor of New York City is made to share Gracie Mansion with three African-American families from Harlem; migrants gather at coastal ports in West Africa and South Asia and swarm into Europe, Australia, and New Zealand; London is taken over by an organization of non- white residents known as the \\"Non-European Commonwealth Committee\\" who force the British queen to have her son marry a Pakistani woman, millions of black Africans from around the continent gather at the Limpopo River and invade South Africa, and only one drunken Soviet soldier stands in the way of hundreds of thousands of Chinese peasants as they overrun Siberia. The epilogue reveals that the story was written in the last holdout of the Western world, Switzerland, but international pressure from the new governments, isolating it as a rogue state for not opening its borders, and the internal pro-migrant elements, force it to capitulate as well. Mere hours from the border opening, the author dedicates the book to his grandchildren, in the hopes they will grow up in a world where they will not be ashamed of him for writing such a book.  Reception  According to Professor of literature Jean-Marc Moura, native French people are described in the novel as \\"[giving] in without a blow to the hyperbolic egalitarianism that 'swallows' them down to the rank of third-world men. (...) In such a context, racist deviations are inevitable. (...) The plot is thus biased, since the cards are dealt in such a way that racism and ostracism become conditions for survival. By painting the Third World in such aggressive colours, it gives Western characters little choice: destroy or die.\\" Philosopher Sidney Hook said that it would \\"succeed in shocking and challenging the complacent contemporary mind.\\" Moura notes that The Camp of the Saints received a positive reception,\\"... a connu de nombreuses traductions et, en France, un accueil critique favorable\\" p. 124 with most critics focusing on the \\"prophetic\\" nature of the story. It was praised by journalist Bernard Pivot and intellectuals such as Jean Anouilh, Herv√© Bazin, Michel D√©on, Jean Cau, Thierry Maulnier and Louis Pauwels. After the book was translated to English, Max Lerner said that it had \\"irresistible pace of skill and narrative\\". In 1975, Time magazine panned the novel as a \\"bilious tirade\\" that only required a response because it \\"arrives trailing clouds of praise from French savants, including Dramatist Jean Anouilh ('A haunting book of irresistible force and calm logic'), with the imprint of a respected U.S. publisher and a teasing pre-publication ad campaign ('The end of the white world is near')\\". Kirkus Reviews compared the novel to Mein Kampf,The Camp of the Saints, reviewed in Kirkus Reviews, published 28 July 1975; retrieved from Kirkus Online, 5 March 2017 while Jeffrey Hart in the National Review mocked the rejection of the novel by critics - deriding them as \\"respectable, comfortable reviewers\\" - and lauded the book, stating \\"in freer and more intelligent circles in Europe, the book is a sensation and Raspail is a prize-winner [...] his plot is both simple and brilliant.\\" Syndicated columnist Garry Wills condemned the embrace of the novel by the \\"more 'respectable' channels\\" of American right-wing media, including Hart, drawing parallels between the \\"racial implications\\" of the book and the National Reviews \\"overtly racist analysis\\" of school integration efforts. In 1983, Linda Chavez called the novel \\"a sickening book\\", describing it as \\"racist, xenophobic and paranoid.\\" In the early 1980s, the director of the French military intelligence, Alexandre de Marenches, gave a copy of the book to Ronald Reagan, who reportedly stated that he was \\"terribly impressed\\" with it. The December 1994 cover story of The Atlantic Monthly focused on the themes of the novel, analyzing them in the context of international relations, while describing it as \\"the most politically incorrect book in France in the second half of the twentieth century\\". Its authors, British historian Paul Kennedy and Columbia professor Matthew Connelly further wrote, \\"many members of the more prosperous economies are beginning to agree with Raspail's vision\\". In 2001, the Southern Poverty Law Center described it as \\"widely revered by American white supremacists and is a sort of anti-immigration analog to The Turner Diaries.\\"Racist Book, Camp of the Saints, Gains in Popularity, Intelligence Report, 21 March 2001 Again, in October 2015, the SPLC condemned the novel as \\"the favorite racist fantasy of the anti-immigrant movement in the US.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center has compared the book to The Turner Diaries, attributing its popularity with white nationalists to the plot's parallels with the white genocide conspiracy theory. Ryan Lenz of the SPLC notes that \\"[t]he premise of Camp of the Saints plays directly into that idea of white genocide. It is the idea that through immigration, if it's left unchecked, the racial character and content of a culture can be undermined to the point of oblivion.\\" In November 2019, Michael Edison Hayden, senior investigative reporter for the SPLC's HateWatch, referred to the book as \\"absolutely disgustingly racist\\". In 2002, Lionel Shriver described the novel as \\"both prescient and appalling,\\" certainly \\"racist\\" but \\"written with tremendous verbal energy and passion.\\" Shriver writes that the book \\"gives bilious voice to an emotion whose expression is increasingly taboo in the West, but that can grow only more virulent when suppressed: the fierce resentment felt by majority populations when that status seems threatened.\\"Lionel Shriver: \\"Population doomsday\\", New Statesman, 10 June 2002, retrieved 1 December 2012 William F. Buckley, Jr. praised the book in 2004 as \\"a great novel\\" that raised questions on how to respond to massive illegal immigration,Buckley, Jr., William F. \\"No Irish Need Apply.\\" National Review Online. 23 July 2004 and in 2014, Mackubin Thomas Owens noted Buckley's praise of it, while remarking that \\"Raspail was ahead of his time in demonstrating that Western civilization had lost its sense of purpose and history‚Äîits 'exceptionalism'.\\" In 2005, the conservative Chilton Williamson praised the book as \\"one of the most uncompromising works of literary reaction in the 20th century.\\" The book returned to the bestseller list, ranking in the top 5 in bookstores in France in March 2011. It has been favorably referred to by Steve Bannon, U.S. President Donald Trump's former Chief Strategist. It has also been promoted by Trump's senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, GOP Congressman Steve King, French National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, and by Special Assistant to the President Julia Hahn.  English translations  A translation by Norman Shapiro was published by Scribner in 1975 (). It was republished in mass market paperback format in 1977 by Ace Books () and Sphere Books (), and in softcover format by white nationalist publisher The Social Contract Press in 1995 (). The novel is available in Amazon Kindle format.

Sotolon is the major aroma and flavor component of fenugreek seed and lovage, and is one of several aromatic and flavor components of artificial maple syrup. It is also present in molasses, aged rum, aged sake and white wine, flor sherry, roast tobacco,Sigma-Aldrich and dried fruiting bodies of the mushroom Lactarius helvus. Sotolon can pass through the body relatively unchanged, and consumption of foods high in sotolon, such as fenugreek, can impart a maple syrup aroma to one's sweat and urine. In some individuals with the genetic disorder maple syrup urine disease, it is spontaneously produced in their bodies and excreted in their urine, leading to the disease's characteristic smell. This molecule is thought to be responsible for the mysterious maple syrup smell that has occasionally wafted over Manhattan since 2005. Sotolon was first isolated in 1975 from the herb fenugreek.F. Rijkens and H. Boelens (1975) \\"The future of aroma research,\\" Proceedings of the International Symposium on Aroma Research, H. Maarse and P.J. Groenen, eds. (Wageningen, Netherlands: Pudoc, 1975), pp. 203-220. The compound was named in 1980 when it was found to be responsible for the flavor of raw cane sugar: soto- means \\"raw sugar\\" in Japanese and -olon signifies that the molecule is an enol lactone.Tokitomo, Yukiko; Kobayashi, Akio; Yamanishi, Tei; Muraki, Shigeru (1980) \\"Studies on the \\"sugary flavor\\" of raw cane sugar. III. Key compound of the sugary flavor,\\" Proceedings of the Japan Academy, series B, 56 (7) : 457-462 ; see footnote on p. 457. Several aging-derived compounds have been pointed out as playing an important role on the aroma of fortified wines however, sotolon (3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl-2(5H)-furanone) is recognized as being the key odorant and has also been classified as a potential aging marker of these type of wines. This chiral lactone is a powerful odorant, which can impart a nutty, caramel, curry, or rancid odor, depending on its concentration and enantiomeric distribution. Despite being pointed out as a key odorant of other fortified wines, the researchers‚Äô attention has also been directed to its off-flavor character, associated to the premature oxidative aging of young dry white wines, overlapping the expected fruity, flowery, and fresh character. This compound can be detected by miniaturized emulsification extraction followed by GC‚ÄìMS/SIM and single-step miniaturized liquid-liquid extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis French vin jaune Vin jaune is marked by the formation of sotolon from Œ±-ketobutyric acid.

It is the largest community in King Township, with 2,396 dwellings and a population of 6,970 as of the Canada 2016 Census. History A map of the community published in 1878 in Illustrated historical atlas of the county of York and the township of West Gwillimbury & town of Bradford in the county of Simcoe, Ont. In 1836, a settlement styled Springhill was established in King. With the arrival of the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron railway in 1853, the settlement began to expand. In 1890, the reeve of King township James Whiting Crossley incorporated King City by merging the hamlets of Springhill, Kinghorn, Laskay, and Eversley. Geography King City is characterized by rolling hills and clustered temperate forests in the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests ecoregion. Numerous kettle lakes and ponds dot the area. Creeks and streams from King City, the surrounding area, and as far west as Bolton and as far east as Stouffville are the origin for the East Humber River. Situated entirely on the southern slope of the central portion of the Oak Ridges Moraine and its watershed, numerous disputes about planning and development have occurred municipally, such as installation of a sewerage system connecting the community to the Durham-York Sewage System in the 2000s. Numerous stables and other farms have been established on the of land area occupied by the township. Ecology Eastern Hemlock foliage and cone The provincially significant King-Vaughan Wetland Complex consists of 23 individual wetlands (83% swamp, 17% marsh). It is composed of clay, loam and silt soils on a site that is palustrine (69%) or isolated (31%). Vegetation found on this wetland includes tall shrubs (34%), deciduous trees (28%), dead trees and shrubs (19%), and narrow-leaved emergents (12%); additionally, robust emergents and free-floating plants are found in small agglomerations. King Forest is a 60-hectare forest with steep valleys containing the narrow flood plain of the East Humber River. The valley walls are of dry-mesic nature, supporting Eastern White Cedar, Eastern Hemlock and Sugar Maple. It is a regenerating forest containing 85 ground-cover species. The flood plain consists primarily of Eastern White Cedar, Sugar Maple and some White Ash, though 26 species do thrive in the area. The King City Wetland Complex contains eight wetlands (77% swamp, 23% marsh) over 49 hectares. It is a palustrine formation composed 70% of clay, loam or silt soils, and 30% organic soils. It has varied vegetation, including tall shrubs (40%), deciduous trees (37%), robust emergents (14%), narrow-leaved emergents (4%) and submergent vegetation (4%). Also, the King-Vaughan Forest straddles King City and portions of Vaughan. It is similar to the King Forest, composed of forest areas on steep valley walls containing the flood plain of the Humber River. The dominant species on the valley walls are Sugar Maple and Eastern Hemlock, which are strongly regenerative in the forest. On the flood plain, a greater variety of species may be observed. Immature stands of Manitoba Maple and Eastern White Cedar, poplars and American Elm can be found here, as can an extensive Hawthorn scrubland. Climate King City has a continental climate moderated by the Great Lakes and influenced by warm, moist air masses from the south, and cold, dry air from the north. The Oak Ridges Moraine affects levels of precipitation: as an air mass arrives from Lake Ontario and reaches the elevated ground surface of the moraine, it rises causing precipitation.Cf. Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Rouge River Watershed Plan Report (2007), 15. Politics The King Township municipal offices are located in King City. King City does not have its own municipal government; it is represented municipally on King Township council by two councillors, in Wards 1 and 5. Ward 1 covers King City east of Keele Street, and includes the communities of Eversley, Snowball and Temperanceville. Ward 5 includes the western part of King City to Highway 400. =Sewage system= King City was historically served by septic systems. In 2001, York Region took away control of planning for King Township's sewage collection system. The Township's council at the time opposed the installation of a sewage system in King City, and brought the issue to court. Changes to the Regional Municipalities Act in 2001 resulted in regional control of sewer and water systems by regional government. The municipal government has authority to plan and manage the local collection system. The 2003 municipal elections resulted in a council favourable to installation of a sewage system in the town and its connection to the York-Durham Sewage System. The Township subsequently applied for project provincial and federal construction grants. Proponents of the link cited health concerns about the septic systems in the community, and the occasional spill, as reasons to link to the Durham-York system. Opponents stated that the health issues of the septic systems were embellished, and that the link would result in poorly controlled growth in the community, and hence urban sprawl. The King City Sanitary Servicing Project began construction in early 2005, jointly funded by King Township and York Region. A by-law was passed in April 2005 that made it mandatory for residents to connect to the new sewer system. Installation of the near $50 million project was funded through tax receipts, which included system linkage for public facilities such as municipal offices and the library. This cost included only the provision of a sewerage connection at the property line. In addition, homeowners are required to install piping from the home to the sewerage connection at their expense. Decommissioning and infilling septic tanks is also mandatory. Installation of the wastewater system was followed by numerous applications for development of residential subdivisions. By 2012, there were at least eight subdivision developments under construction and two expansions within King City, which are expected to add 690 detached houses, 299 townhouses, and a 134-unit four-storey condominium complex, as well as expanding the York Region Seniors Housing centre by 40 units. =Traffic= Through traffic on King Road has become a concern in the past decade, as the number of heavy vehicles has increased significantly. Notably, dump trucks serving new subdivision construction sites in nearby Oak Ridges use King Road to reach Highway 400. Delivery trucks destined for Aurora and Richmond Hill also make use of King Road as a bypass. The Township borders on Peel Region, which has promoted the extension of Highway 427 from its current terminus at Highway 7 north to the Bradford Bypass. This extension would border the Township, raising concerns about noise pollution in the rural area. Lifestyle and cultureCulture= King City has been a filming location for at least ten movies/TV shows: * The CBC TV show, The Forest Rangers, had some scenes filmed on Mary Lake near the shrine. * The 1972 film, Mahoney's Estate, used the downtown section of King City in a major scenehttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073336/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt * The 1972 Canadian TV show, Almost Home, used the downtown as well. * The 1976 movie, Death Weekend, was filmed mainly at Eaton Hall. * The Gate (1987) was filmed and set at a house located in King Heights subdivision * To Die For (1995) had a number of scenes filmed at King City Secondary School. * Golden Will: The Silken Laumann Story (1996, TV) was entirely filmed in King City. * Walt Disney's Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004) also had some scenes filmed during a three-day period in July 2003 at King City Secondary School. * A History of Violence (2005) had its final scene filmed at the historic Eaton Hall in King City, and a baseball scene filmed in Pottageville. * Billy Madison (1995) had some scenes filmed at the gates to Mary Lake Shrine just north of King City. King City is also the location of Shift an outdoor sculpture by Richard Serra built between 1970 and 1972. The sculpture was commissioned by Roger Davidson, and is being considered for protection under the Ontario Heritage Act by the Township of King Heritage Committee. The work is located on land just south of the village, for which the township has received development proposals by its owner Great Gulf Group. =Education= The Seneca College King Campus is located in King City; it is the only post- secondary education facility in King Township, and one of its major employers. Like the rest of Ontario, King City has access to two public education systems: the regional boards are the York Catholic District School Board and the York Region District School Board. King City Secondary School is a public school that serves students from all King Township. With a student body of approximately 1100, course offerings are moderate but varied. The school features a full-size 400m outdoor track and a soccer pitch. Within the public school system, King City Public School serves the community. Holy Name Catholic School offers education within the Catholic separate school system. Additionally, the community is served by a number of private institutions: * King City Montessori School, which serves pre-school and kindergarten age groups * The Country Day School, has kindergarten to Grade 12. * St. Thomas of Villanova College at Mary Lake Shrine. =Religion= All Saints Church was established in King City in 1857. Traditionally, King City has been a Protestant community, but Roman Catholicism has a nearly equal number of followers (statistics for the whole Township of King are used). Protestants make up 41% of the population, whereas Roman Catholics represent 39% of residents. Both of these religions outnumber the remaining faiths in practice within King City, namely those who identify themselves as Christian Orthodox (1%), Muslim (0.5%), Jewish (0.5%), Hindu (0.5%), or Sikh (0.5%). Approximately 17% of the population has no religious affiliation. King City is home to five churches and a shrine: * Sacred Heart Church is a Roman Catholic institution. * King City United Church is affiliated with the United Church of Canada, which is the largest Protestant-denominated church in Canada. * St. Andrews Presbyterian Church operates within the Presbyterian Church of Canada, another Protestant-denominated church. * All Saints, King City is an Anglican church affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada, the third major Protestant-denominated religious branch in Canada. * King Bible Church is affiliated with the Associated Gospel Churches of Canada. * The Shrine of Our Lady of Grace is a Marian shrine at Mary Lake, an Augustinian Monastery located on the northern edge of King City; it is also referred to as Mary Lake Shrine. =Recreation= The King City Community Centre and King City Arena host numerous activities, such as youth hockey league matches and yoga classes. They also host many community events throughout the year, and some public King Township meetings. Leagues for girls and boys hockey, tennis, soccer, and baseball exist, and a number of clubs provide other avenues for kids to enjoy and learn. King City Memorial Park, next to the arena, has two baseball fields, several soccer fields, two children's playgrounds, and four tennis courts (two with lighting). An open, covered area is used for public events and picnics. A portion of the extensive Oak Ridges Trail passes through King City. The community is creating its own trail network, the King City Trail; the two networks are currently not connected. Private recreation facilities include St. Edmunds Sparkling Cricket Club cricket facility operated by the Maple Leaf Cricket Club, and two golf clubs: King's Riding Golf Club and King Valley Golf Club. Residents are within a ten-minute commute to recreation in other communities. The Maple Community Centre, operated by the City of Vaughan, offers services and memberships to non-Vaughan residents. Services available include a fitness centre, a pool for lap and family swimming, and a public library. Aurora and Richmond Hill also have facilities, both private and public, easily accessible to King City residents. =Organizations and clubs= * King City Business and Community Association: Founded in December 2011, the King City Business and Community Association is an organization of citizens and business owners living and operating in King City. Throughout the year, the KCBCA hosts and participates in a variety of community initiatives and events. For example, the Annual Christmas in King City, and the Summer Street Festival. The KCBCA also strives to improve the community aesthetic, hoping to make King City a more beautiful place for everyone to work in, shop, and enjoy. * King Township Public Library King City Branch offers reading programs for kids, maintains a 3-month community papers archive, and is home to the Township of King Archive Collections. * King Township Historical Society seeks to archive and preserve information about the township's past and culture. * King City Preserve the Village is an organization that was founded to fight the Big Pipe link to the Durham-York Sewer System, and urban sprawl in King Township. * The Maple Leaf Cricket Club was established in 1954, and operates on turf wickets facilities. The Club has five cricket grounds which operate on turf wickets. The northwest ground has become the second ground in Canada to be approved to host One Day Internationals (ODI's) by the International Cricket Council in the year 2006. It has become Cricket Canada's main facility for International matches. The club aspires to be the future home of the Canadian Cricket Academy. * Hospice King-Aurora (previously Hospice King) is a non-profit charity which provides non-medical palliative care for individuals (and their families) with a life- threatening illness. Other services include bereavement support programs, and other counselling with a registered social worker. It was established in 1983, and is a member of the Hospice Palliative Care Ontario. * Hike Ontario is headquartered in King City.

It is in the district of Riviera-Pays-d'Enhaut. History Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx is first mentioned in 1115 as Oit, Oyz, Oix and Oyez. =Prehistoric settlements= During the late Paleolithic and Mesolithic (9500 BC to at least 6000 BC) caves around Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx served as a seasonal settlement. Bronze Age knives indicate that there was a settlement during that era as well. Many of the local names (combe = valley, joeur = forest, man= rock) and the local dialect are the only traces of a Celtic settlement in the area. The lack of iron ore and the sparseness of the soil probably prevented the romanization of lowland valleys. During the Gallo-Roman era, the region may have been only sparsely populated. By the 10th century, the Alamannic settlements had only reached Le Vanel but then spread even higher and reached the pastures in L'√âtivaz in the southern part of the municipality. The valley was known as the high Gau or Ogo. The name may have come from the word for Ox or be a form of √Ñesch, (or ash). =Medieval history= In the 10th century, the Count of Gruyere conquered La Tine and the Creux de l'Enfer. Subsequently, it was merged with Rossini√®re to form a district. The church of St. Donat was consecrated and first mentioned in 1175. The village church was under the authority of the Cluniac Priory of Rougemont, which was founded in 1080. At the beginning of the 14th century, the castle at La Motte was rebuilt for the Counts of Gruyere. Another stronghold probably stood on the rocky spur which was known as Ch√¢teau Cottier. After clearing the woods, the region was intensively farmed and produced barley, hay, hemp and cheese. In 1388 the villagers threw off the obligation to serve the nobility. Then, in 1403, against the wishes of the Count of Gruy√®res, the villagers joined a limited alliance with Bern. =Growth during the Early Modern era= Old church in Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx In 1555 Bern received the upper part of the county of Gruyere including Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx. It became part of the German-speaking bailiwick of Saanen. The rights and freedoms of the villagers were now based on Bernese law and not on the Land Law of Moudon. However, the village church was still part of the parish under the collegiate church of Lausanne. Following the Protestant Reformation in 1555, the parish also included Etivaz until 1713. Under Bernese rule, the economy experienced a strong upswing. The common land was divided and sold before the end of the 16th century. The alpine pastures were leased to private cheese makers, who there produced Gruy√®re cheese. In the 18th century, the inhabitants of the municipality went over the Col de Jaman to sell the cheese, from the approximately 2,000 cows, at the market in Vevey. From there, it went to Marseille where it was exported to Asia and America. =End of the Ancien R√©gime and Modern Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx= House in the historic center of Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx In 1798, Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx came to the newly formed Canton of L√©man. In 1800, a fire destroyed the wooden houses on the central hill. The houses had been built in this style and on the hill to avoid property taxes. Thanks to the efforts of the Dean Philippe-Sirice Bridel enough money was raised to rebuild the houses in stone. The municipality hired masons from Savoy, carpenters from Simmental and plasterers from the lower Gruyere lands lower uplands. In 1803, the Canton of L√©man was dissolved with the Act of Mediation and the municipality became part of the new canton of Vaud. In 1849, the Institute Henchoz opened as a preparatory gymnasium, which replaced the older Latin school. The primary school received a new building in 1907. Starting in 1847 a parish of the Free Church of the Canton of Vaud was established with two priests. The Catholic parish was established in 1896 and the Anglican church parish was created in 1899. Other religious communities, such as the Plymouth Brethren, established churches in the valley. In the 19th century, the municipality suffered several outbreaks of livestock diseases. To protect the dairy industry, non-local herds were forbidden from passing through the municipality. Cheese was no longer allowed to be carried across the mountains but was now transported on local draft horses. Due to customs taxes with the neighboring Canton of Fribourg, cheese was carried on a route over the Col de Chaude to Villeneuve (VD) and from there to the shores of Lake Geneva, without crossing the Fribourg border. The abolition of the inter-canton customs and taxes in 1848 led to the demolition of the Fribourg customs station on the main road that had linked Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx with the grain and livestock markets. Changes in markets and improvements in animal husbandry led to more Simmental cattle being raised for meat rather than cheese production. The construction of the road over the Col des Mosses (1865‚Äì71) and the construction of a new road to Bulle (1895) eased transportation. Balloon above the streets of Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx The hospital, which had replaced the old hospital in 1926, was remodeled in 1979 into a nursing home and district hospital. At the same time, solar heating was added to the building. The municipal administration building was built in 1912, and renovated in 1958. The Mus√©e du Vieux Pays-d'Enhaut was built in 1922. A power plant was operated in La Chaudanne from 1894 until about 1901. The opening of the Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway (MOB) in 1904 made Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx an attractive summer resort. It was particularly appreciated by English tourists. Between 1916-18 it also housed English internees during the war. Half a dozen grand hotels with tennis courts sprang up in the municipality. A tennis club was founded in 1894. Other infrastructure included the suspension bridge at Turrian (1883), a swimming pool and a campsite (1932), a cable car (1945) and the Pont du Berceau (1945). The agricultural sector has remained important, with the emphasis again shifting to cheese. In the 20th century, winter tourism became an important additional source of income. Hot air balloons and river rafting became common in the summer, while local crafts, sawmills and gravel mining are the main branches of the industrial sector. Since 1945, the area around Pierreuse has been a protected heritage site. =World War I internment= During World War I Switzerland accepted 68,000 sick or injured Prisoners of war from both sides of the conflict. These prisoners required medical care that they could not receive in internment camps due to a demand for doctors at the front to care for their own nation's injured. Following an agreement between the belligerent nations and with support from the Red Cross the internees were transferred to neutral Switzerland. The first train load of injured soldiers arrived to cheering crowds at Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx on 30 May 1916. The British ambassador to Switzerland, Sir Evelyn Grant Duff, met the first train and recorded in his diary that evening: Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx was the first community chosen to host the injured prisoners because its letter offering to help was the first one received by the Swiss government. Over the following two years many resort communities, devastated as tourism vanished during the war, experienced growth as internees were housed in empty resorts and as their loved ones visited. =Escher= In 1935, the Dutch painter M.C. Escher and his wife Jutta decided to leave Italy, where they had lived for many years, after their nine-year-old son was forced to join the Fascist Ballila Youth Movement. They found refuge in Switzerland and lived for two years in Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx. Geography View of Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx and the surrounding mountains Aerial view (1964) Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx has an area, , of .

Considered as one of the most important educators and researchers in physics in Brazil, along with Cesar Lattes, Jos√© Leite Lopes and Mario Schenberg, Damy was born in Campinas, S√£o Paulo, in 1914, the son of Harald Egydio de Souza Santos a photographer, and Maria Luiza Damy de Souza Santos. He did his secondary studies in the State Gymnasium (later to be called Col√©gio Culto √† Ci√™ncia) and was a keen student of sciences, particularly physics and chemistry. In 1932, he was admitted to the Polytechnic School of the University of S√£o Paulo to study electrical engineering, but eventually switched to physics at the invitation of Prof. Gleb Wataghin, a Russian physicist who was teaching at the time in the university, whose classes Damy enjoyed to listen, although they were given in a different course from his. He graduated in the first class of the course of physics at USP. During his undergraduate years, Damy became interested in radioactivity. This interest started his successful lifelong career in experimental nuclear physics. After graduation, he went to Cambridge University, at 24, with a grant from the British Council, under the supervision of Prof. William L. Bragg (Nobel Prize in Physics). In England he became friends with Edmundo Barbosa da Silva, Oxford University student and future colleague in the Atomic Energy Commission of the Brazilian National Research Council. Back in Brazil, Damy worked as a research scientist for the Brazilian Navy, especially in the development of a sonar, working in a laboratory on the premises of the department of physics at the USP Faculty of Philosophy, Science and Letters until the end of World War II (1945). For this important work he received the Brazilian Medal of Naval Merit. In 1945, at the invitation of the Rockefeller Foundation, Damy spent nine months at the University of Illinois. where he worked with Prof. Donald William Kerst, inventor of the betatron. Returning once again to Brazil, Damy accepted an assistant professorship at the Department of Physics of USP, and helped install there in 1950 a betatron, the first particle accelerator operating in Latin America. He also developed and installed the first nuclear reactor in Brazil, still in working order today. Another area of research of Damy was cosmic rays, particularly aimed at assessing the nature of the penetrating showers of cosmic rays. He demonstrated that these showers had atomic particles such as mesons, which had a great penetrating power without losing considerably part of its energy. Along with Gleb Wataghin and Paulus Aulus Pomp√©ia he found that these showers are more energetic than previously supposed. This work was published internationally.Wataghin, G., Pompeia, P. A., Santos, M. D. S. Phys. Rev. 57 (1940). Damy was one of the greatest scientific leaders in Brazil, helping to found many important research and educational institutions in his area. He was a founder of the Institute of Atomic Energy and the Institute of Research on Nuclear Energy (IPEN), and its first superintendent, from 1956 to 1961. He was also president of the National Commission of Nuclear Energy (CNEN) from 1961 to 1964. After retiring as professor emeritus from USP in 1968, Damy helped to consolidate the newly established State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and took over as director of the Institute of Physics, which received the name of his former professor, Gleb Wataghin. Furthermore, he worked as a professor of nuclear physics at the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo (PUC-SP) and, since 1988, collaborated again in research work done at IPEN. He authored over 80 papers and was a member of several scientific societies in Brazil and abroad, with emphasis on the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. He married Lucia Toledo de Souza Santos in 1947. Damy died on November 29, 2009, from complications of a stroke. Quote \\"A good teacher is a researcher who likes to tell the things he does and sees others doing.

Scholes, ed.) He is most remembered as the creator of the song \\"Dixie\\". Early and family life Dan Emmett was born in Mount Vernon, Knox County, Ohio, then a frontier region. His grandfather, Rev. John Emmett (1759‚Äì1847) had been born in Cecil County, Maryland, and after serving as a private in the American Revolutionary War and fighting at the Battle of White Plains in New York and later in Delaware, became a Methodist minister in the then-vast frontier Augusta County, Virginia, and then moved across the Appalachian Mountains to Licking County, Ohio and also served in the Ohio legislature representing Pickaway County, Ohio in the Scioto River valley.http://wiki.lickingcountylibrary.info/Rev._John_Emmett His father, Abraham Emmett (1791-1846) served as a private in the War of 1812 while his father served in the Ohio legislature. Notwithstanding his grandfather's career, Dan had little formal education. He learned popular tunes from his musical mother, and taught himself to play the fiddle. At age 13, Emmett became apprenticed to a printer and in 1836, when he was 21, enlisted in the United States Army.U.S. Army Register of enlistments p. 267 of 440 available at ancestry.com He became an expert fifer and drummer at Newport Barracks, Newport, Kentucky. He married Catharine Rives (born 1829) in 1853 in New York City, and they remained together until her death in 1875. Four years later, Emmett married Mary Bird (or Browner; 1935‚Äì1917) in Chicago, Illinois; Emmett did not have children.Cook County register of marriages available on ancestry.com Career After receiving his discharge from the army on July 8, 1835, Emmett joined a Cincinnati circus. In 1840‚Äì1842 he toured with Angevine and other circuses as a blackface banjoist and singer. Emmett was a Catholic. In association with Billy Whitlock, Dick Pelham, and Frank Brower, he organized the Virginia Minstrels, which made their first appearance before a paying audience at the Chatham Theatre in New York City in 1843.Whitlock, who detailed the beginnings of the group, stated that the event was a benefit for Pelham. See Lawrence Hutton, \\"The Negro on the Stage,\\" Harpers New Monthly Magazine, June 1889, p. 140. Such an event occurred on January 31. See The New York Herald, January 31, 1843, p. 3. The following day the Herald reported that the troupe would be appearing at the Bowery Amphitheatre, and an advertisement in February 6 issue refers to their first performance that evening. Photograph of Dan Emmett in blackface, probably early 1860s. Although blackface performance, in which white men painted their faces and hands black and impersonated caricatures of African-American men and women, was already an established performance mode at that time--Thomas D. Rice had created the character of Jim Crow nearly a decade earlier, and blackface had been widely popular ever since--Emmett's group is said to be the first to \\"black up\\" an entire band rather than one or two performers. The group's full-length blackface performance is generally considered to have been the first true minstrel show: previous blackface acts were usually either an entr'acte for a play or one of many acts in a comic variety show. Emmett is traditionally credited with writing the song \\"Dixie\\". The story that he related about its composition varied each time he told it, but the main points were that he composed the song in New York City while a member of Bryant's Minstrels. The song was first performed by Emmett and the Bryants at Mechanics' Hall in New York City on April 4, 1859. The song became a runaway hit, especially in the South, and the piece for which Emmett was most well known. Emmett himself reportedly told a fellow minstrel: \\"If I had known to what use they [Southerners] were going to put my song, I will be damned if I'd have written it.\\"Letter from Col. T. Allston Brown to T.C. De Leon. Published in De Leon, Belles, Beaux, and Brains and quoted in Nathan 275. After the South began using his song as a rallying call, Emmett wrote the fife-and-drum manual for the Union Army. In 1862, Emmett published his own Fifer's and Drummer's Guide in cooperation with George G. Bruce. Emmett's song was a favorite of President Abraham Lincoln, who said after the war ended in 1865, \\"I have always thought that 'Dixie' was one of the best tunes I ever heard... I insisted yesterday that we had fairly captured it.\\"Speech given on April 10, 1865 and quoted in Hall 10. Another writer named William Shakespeare Hays (1837‚Äì1907) (pen name: Will S. Hays) claimed to be the song's true author.Abel, E. Lawrence (2000). Singing the New Nation: How Music Shaped the Confederacy, 1861‚Äì1865. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books, p. 47. Members of the Snowden Family have also been named as writers of the song, namely John Baptist Snowden, a freed slave.Sacks, Howard L. and Sacks, Judith Rose (1993). Way up North in Dixie: A Black Family's Claim to the Confederate Anthem. Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, p. 3.  Death and posthumous recognition  After a tour that was notably successful in the South, Emmett retired to his hometown of Mount Vernon in 1888Occasionally taking part in performances: \\"Dan Emmett, whenever he is physically able and can get the chance, 'rosins his bow' for a dance party in Chicago.\\"New York Times, July 10, 1887: 'Drop- Curtain Monographs' where he died on June 28, 1904, aged 88 years. From 1893 to the time of his death, he was aided by a weekly allowance from the Actors Fund of America. Emmett was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. A biographical film of his life was produced in 1943, titled Dixie. Starring Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, it is a musical directed by A. Edward Sutherland. Numerous schools, businesses, and other institutions in Mount Vernon, Ohio, are named after Emmett. The official memorial to him is a large boulder with a placard attached located in front of the Knox County Historical Museum. Emmett published at least 30 songs between 1843 and 1865, most of which are banjo tunes or walk-arounds. Between 1859 and 1869, he composed another 25 tunes that are in manuscript at the Ohio Historical Society in Columbus, Ohio.

It was built between 1973 and 1978. It was also the second bus model jointly built by these two companies. The first model was the Metro- Scania single decker based on the BR110/CR110 chassis, which was first built for the UK market in 1969 and sold in small numbers. Construction The Metropolitan was basically the double deck version of the Metro-Scania, it was based on Scania BR111DH chassis and the body was constructed by MCW. The distinguishing feature is the asymmetric windscreen being deeper on the nearside to give the driver a good view of the kerb (a similar design being used on the Mk I version of the MCW Metrobus). It was noted for its lively performance from the turbocharged Scania engine when compared to the old- fashioned Gardner and Leyland diesels used in many buses of the time, smooth ride due to air suspension (although the Guy Wulfrunian was the first double decker bus to have this feature) and thirst for fuel consumption. However severe corrosion problems of the body structure led these buses to have a short life in service. Customers West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive MCW bodied Scania Metropolitan in Bradford in July 1975 * London Transport A preserved, Ex London Transport Metropolitan, now owned by Ensignbus London Transport was once the largest operator of Metropolitans, with 164 being delivered between 1975 and 1977, but all of them were withdrawn by 1983. Some continued in service with other operators for several years. These included Charles Cook of Biggleswade who ran them between 1983 and 1993, Whippet of Fenstanton who even operated an open top example originating from Hull City Transport, Black Prince, Alec Head of Lutton and Camms of Nottingham. MD1 (KJD 201P) appeared in The Human League's music video Life On Your Own in 1984 and is now preserved in a Scania museum in Sweden while MD9 exists on a farm in Potton, Bedfordshire for non-PSV use, it was sold to the owner by Charles Cook. MD60 is currently preserved in the later London Transport livery, having only recently completed restoration. * Tyne and Wear Transport (TWPTE) Tyne and Wear PTE were the second-largest operator of Metropolitans, building up 140 of them between 1975 and 1977. By the mid-1980s most of the Tyne & Wear Metropolitan's were withdrawn although a handful did pass to the new arms-length private company Busways Travel Services brought about by de-regulation of the British bus industry in 1986. 499 (RCU 499S) was the last to be withdrawn in 1989, and the only vehicle to be repainted in the Busways livery. A significant proportion of them were acquired by various operators throughout the UK and some of the Tyne & Wear Metropolitans have also survived into preservation. * West Yorkshire MetroBus (WYPTE) West Yorkshire PTE, more commonly known as MetroBus, purchased 95 Metropolitans between 1975 and 1977. They were all withdrawn by 1985. One example entered preservation, but was eventually scrapped in the early 1990s. * Leicester City Transport Preserved Leicester City Transport MCW bodied Scania Metropolitan in Duxford in September 2010 Leicester City Transport bought 35 single-deck Metro-Scanias and following their success bought 68 double-deck Metropolitans in several batches between 1974 and 1977 (and a handful of second hand ones for further service and spare parts), both in dual door configuration, and a final batch of 5 with single door in 1977. One dual door 1975 example 301 (GJF 301N) survives in preservation, restored to original LCT cream/maroon livery, and attends regular rallies along with the last surviving Metro-Scania single decker 225 (ARY 225K). * Merseyside Transport (MPTE) Merseyside Transport was another major customer for the Metropolitan, eventually purchasing 60 in the mid-1970s following on from 20 single-deck-based BR110 Metro-Scanias in 1972/73. Allocated to the Green Lane and Prince Alfred Road depot's in Liverpool they were all withdrawn by the summer of 1986 perhaps hastened by deregulation and the formation of arms-length private company Merseybus which standardised its double deck requirement on the Leyland Atlantean - that Merseyside Transport bought in large quantities. Some of the Merseyside Metropolitans were sold for further service with other operators with Kingston Upon Hull City Transport (KHCT) being a notable example. However the vast majority were scrapped and by the 1990s all of the Merseyside examples were believed to have been scrapped. * Greater Glasgow PTE Greater Glasgow PTE purchased 40 Metropolitans in 1975. All were withdrawn in 1981-82. * Reading Transport Reading Transport MCW bodied Scania Metropolitan at Dover Eastern Docks on a visit to Reading's twin town of D√ºsseldorf in Germany in April 1978. Reading Transport took 33 Metropolitans from 1975 to 1978, and added to these with a number from the London Transport and Tyne & Wear Transport fleets. The last one was withdrawn in 1992. * Hull Corporation/City Transport Hull bought 30 Metropolitans between 1975 and 1978. They survived into deregulation and the formation of Kingston Upon Hull City Transport (KHCT) and were augmented second-hand examples from Merseyside Transport (see above). They were withdrawn by the end of the 1980s and pretty much all have been scrapped, however one notable former Hull example - 436 WKH426S, was retained as an open-topper by Cambridgeshire operator Whippet Coaches/Go Whippet. It has since passed to EnsignBus as a source of spare parts. * Greater Manchester Transport (GMPTE) Greater Manchester Transport purchased 10 Metropolitans in 1974 for use on the Trans-Lancs Express service 400 linking Bolton to Stockport via Bury, Rochdale, Oldham and Ashton-under-Lyne. Greater Manchester Transport withdrew them from service in the early 1980s. * Newport Corporation Transport Newport Corporation Transport bought 10 Metropolitans in 1975 which were withdrawn from service in 1985. * South Yorkshire Transport (SYPTE) South Yorkshire Transport purchased 4 Metropolitans in 1975. Again they were withdrawn in the 1980s and are all believed to have been scrapped. * Maidstone & District Motor Services 5 purchased in 1975. * China Motor Bus (CMB) This Hong Kong operator purchased two Metropolitans in 1975. They were withdrawn in the late 1980s. * West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) WMPTE, despite being a major customer for MCW bodywork on Daimler/Leyland Fleetline and Bristol VR chassis, showed little interest in the Metropolitan and only took one example the former MCW demonstrator 6299 NVP533M which was the very first Metropolitan to be built. WMPTE acquired it in 1977 when it was three years old and sold it to coach operator Trathens in 1983 who used on a London sightseeing contract. However WMPTE - and its deregulated successor West Midlands Travel, did purchase over 1,100 MCW's integral replacement for the Metropolitan - the Metrobus which utilised some Metropolitan technology such as air suspension. End of production The production of Metropolitans was finally terminated in 1978, the last examples going to Reading Transport (with 2 built to dual-purpose specifications with high speed rear axles to operate the express X1 service to London, Aldgate). In all 662 Metropolitans were built. MCW launched the Metrobus in 1977, and Scania launched the BR112DH chassis in 1980 as the replacement of BR111DH.

Life and career Laura Ann Gotlieb Detailed biography of Ann Shulgin was born in Wellington, New Zealand to her parents Bernard Gotlieb, and Gwen Ormiston, and grew up in the village Opicina outside the Italian city Trieste; her father was U.S. Consul in these places, in Trieste for six years before World War II.http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/about/ann_shulgin/ Later in her childhood she lived in the US, Cuba, and Canada. She studied art and became an artist, married an artist and had a child, and they later divorced. She had two more marriages ending in divorce and had three more children. Ann went back to work as a medical transcriber, and met Alexander (\\"Sasha\\") Shulgin in 1978; they were married on 4 July 1981 in their back yard. She worked as a lay therapist with psychedelic substances such as MDMA and 2C-B in therapeutic settings while these drugs were still legal. In her writings she stresses the potential of these drugs from a Jungian psychoanalytic perspective, as well as their use in combination with hypnotherapy. She often appears as a speaker at conventions, and has continued to advocate the use of psychedelics in therapeutic contexts. Together with her husband she has authored the books PiHKAL and TiHKAL. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. She also contributed to the books Thanatos to Eros: 35 Years of Psychedelic Exploration, Entheogens and the Future of Religion, Ecstasy: The Complete Guide, The Secret Chief Revealed, Higher Wisdom: Eminent Elders Explore the Continuing Impact of Psychedelics, and Manifesting Minds: A Review of Psychedelics in Science, Medicine, Sex, and Spirituality.

It borders the Swiss-German Saanenland and the famous resort of Gstaad. The region is T-shaped, comprising two valleys. The main valley runs from the village of La Tine in the direction of Gruy√®res and Bulle to Rougemont, continuing in the direction of Saanen and Gstaad. The secondary valley runs south from Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx to the villages of Etivaz and La Lecherette in the direction of Les Mosses (Col-des-Mosses) and Aigle, continuing to the canton of Valais. It benefits from idyllic summers with beautiful hikes and walks possible. Exhilarating winter skiing is possible in several locations, especially near Rougemont and Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx. The Rougemont ski location is linked by a piste that runs into the Gstaad network of ski runs. Pays-d'Enhaut is the historical center of the Enhaut dialect group of the Franco-Proven√ßal language.

Based on Austin A90 Atlantic mechanicals, it was developed by Donald Healey to be produced in-house by his small Healey car company in Warwick. Healey built a single Healey Hundred for the 1952 London Motor Show, and the design impressed Leonard Lord, managing director of Austin, who was looking for a replacement for the unsuccessful A90. Body styling was by Gerry Coker, the chassis was designed by Barry Bilbie with longitudinal members and cross bracing producing a comparatively stiff structure upon which to mount the body, innovatively welding the front bulkhead to the frame for additional strength. In order to keep the overall vehicle height low the rear axle was underslung, the chassis frame passing under the rear axle assembly. Lord struck a deal with Healey to build it in quantity; bodies made by Jensen Motors were given Austin mechanical components at Austin's Longbridge factory. The car was renamed the Austin-Healey 100. The \\"100\\" was named by Healey for the car's ability to reach ; its successor, the better known Austin-Healey 3000, was named for the 3000 cc displacement of its engine. Apart from the first twenty cars, production Austin-Healey 100s were finished at Austin's Longbridge plant alongside the A90 and based on fully trimmed and painted body/chassis units produced by Jensen in West Bromwich‚Äîin an arrangement the two companies previously had explored with the Austin A40 Sports. 14,634 Austin-Healey 100s were produced. The 100 was the first of three models later called the Big Healeys to distinguish them from the much smaller Austin-Healey Sprite. The Big Healeys are often referred to by their three-character model designators rather than by their models, as the model names do not reflect the mechanical differences and similarities well. BN1 Austin Healey 100 BN1 The first 100s (series \\"BN1\\") were equipped with the same undersquare bore and stroke 2660 cc I4 engines and manual transmission as the standard production A90, but the transmission was modified to be a three-speed unit with overdrive on second and top. Girling drum brakes were fitted all round. The suspension used modified Austin A90 components in order to be as cost effective as possible, steering was by Austin's worm and peg system. Front suspension was independent, double wishbone using coil springs and at the rear a rigid axle with semi elliptic leaf springs. A BN1 tested by The Motor magazine in 1953 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0‚Äì in 11.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£1063 including taxes. A total of 10030 BN1s were built from May 1953 until replaced by the BN2 model in August 1955. A 1954 BN1 (chassis #446766*4) is on permanent display in the Bonneville Salt Flats exhibit at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA. BN2 Austin Healey BN-2 - Vintage RacingThe BN2 was fitted with a real four-speed manual transmission, still with overdrive on the top two gears. Other features that distinguish the BN2 from the BN1 are the slightly larger front wheel arches, different rear axle and being the first 100 with optional two-tone paint. The BN2 was available initially in Carmine Red which was replaced with Reno Red, Spruce Green, Healey Blue, Florida Green, Old English White, Black, and approximately 50 Gunmetal Grey cars. Two- tone options were: White/Black; Reno Red/Black; Healey Blue/White; Black/Reno Red; and Florida Green/White By January 1956 production was running at 200 cars each month and sales in California 150 cars each month.Thoroughbred Sports Car For A Moderate Price. The Times, Tuesday, Feb 28, 1956; pg. 7; Issue 53466 The final BN2 was built in July 1956, with a total of 4604 BN2s produced, including the 100M. Many BN-2 and 100-M Austin Healeys compete in vintage events like the Pittsburgh Vintage Gran Prix. =100M= Austin-Healey 100M A high-performance 100M model was introduced in 1955 with larger carburettors, a cold air box to increase engine air flow, high-lift camshaft and 8.1:1 compression pistons. It produced at 4500 rpm. The front suspension was stiffened and the bonnet gained louvres, along with a bonnet belt. Approximately 70% of 100Ms were finished with a two-tone paint scheme, including one White over Red and another in Black over Pink for display at the 1955 London Motor Show. In all, 640 100Ms were built by the factory. The 100M components (including the high compression pistons) were also available as the Le Mans Engine Modification Kit, which could be installed in either a BN1 or BN2 with the engine in situ, improving the power output to approximately at 4500 rpm. The kit could be ordered from BMC, allowing private owners to make their own modifications. 100S Austin-Healey 100S Built primarily for racing, the aluminium-bodied \\"100S\\" (for Sebring) model developed at 4700 rpm. Five works development/special test cars carrying the \\"SPL\\" chassis number prefix were developed during 1953 and 1954, with one winning its class at Sebring in 1954 and prompting the \\"S\\" designation. Only 50 production 100S cars were made, hand built by the Donald Healey Motor Company at Warwick, delivered between February and November 1955 and carrying the \\"AHS\\" chassis number prefix. To minimize weight and improve performance the cast iron cylinder head was replaced by a Weslake designed aluminium one, and the overdrive unit was not installed. Dunlop disc brakes were used all-round, the world's first production car to feature them both front and rear.Lawrence, Mike. A to Z of Sports Cars 1945‚Äì1990. Bideford, Devon UK: Bay View Books, 1991 To further lighten the vehicle, bumpers and hood (convertible top) were eliminated, the grille reduced in size, and the windscreen made of plastic. In all, weight was reduced by approximately . The majority of 100Ss were two- toned white with Lobelia Blue sides. A handful were produced in solid Spruce Green and red, and a single one in black.

Healey 100 in Vintage Racing  Rich Maloumian Fends off competitors The Austin Healey 100 in BN1 and BN2 models, four cylinder format has done very well in vintage racing. The stock BN2 can produce 100bhp, hence the \\"100\\", however in 100M spec, see above, the larger carburetors, high lift cam and slightly less dished pistons (higher compression) the car can produce up to 110bhp. Some simple modifications, lightening, by removal of the bumpers, interior trim and carpets, the 100 can be quite nimble on racing circuits around the world. Aluminum alloy wheels will accommodate wider and lower profile tires that can lower the center of gravity providing additional stability in corners. Alloy wheels become almost essential as the performance of the car increases and the old wire wheels especially the original 48 spoke wheels become a weak point in the structure. Fortunately there are several suppliers that provide \\"Mini-lite\\" and \\"Panasport\\" style wheels which are close to period correct. #347 wins at Lime Rock Significantly modified four cylinder Healey 100's can provide exceptional performance, competing side by side with six cylinder Aston Martins and even 12 cylinder Ferraris of the same era in vintage events. Shown on the right is the Austin Healey Number 347 driven by Rich Maloumian.

Description Fagrskinna is one of the kings' sagas, written around 1220. It takes its name from one of the manuscripts in which it was preserved, Fagrskinna meaning 'Fair Leather', i.e., 'Fair Parchment'.

On 3 May 1915 he received a commission as an infantry subaltern with the 14th (Reserve) Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, which he joined for training in England. Twelve months later he was transferred to the West Yorkshire Regiment's 11th (Service) Battalion, joining it on the Western Front with an officers reinforcement draft in May 1916 in the trenches at Souchez, near Lens.Entry for Poole in the 'Canadian Virtual War Memorial (2019). https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canadian-virtual-war- memorial/detail/139482 On 7 July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme, whilst in action in the Contalmaison sector, he was buried by earth from a close-call shell impact, which also afflicted him with shell shock, and was medically evacuated from the line to recover in a field hospital. At the end of August 1916 he was medically discharged and rejoined his unit in the field at Martinpuich on the Somme, being placed in command of a platoon of 'C' Company, 11th West Yorks. On 5 October 1916 during a move by the Battalion into frontline trenches at Flers he absented himself without authority from the unit, until being found by military police on 7 October 1916, who placed him under arrest. In early November 1916 it was decided to try him by court martial for desertion in the presence of the enemy whilst on active service. On 24 November 1916 the court martial was convened under officers from the 23rd Division, six witnesses were called before it to give evidence, two of them speaking in his defence, including a doctor from the Royal Army Medical Corps, who testified that in his view Poole was in a psychological condition that rendered him unfit to be placed in charge of a command at the time of his actions. Poole offered in his defence that at the time of absenting himself from his platoon he was in a confused mental state, and had not realised the seriousness of his actions in military law. It was noted by the officers presiding over the proceedings that Poole appeared to be suffering from a nervous collapse around the time that he had absented himself from his unit, and they found him guilty of the charge of desertion, and sentenced him to death by firing squad. On 3 December 1916 a British Army medical board examined him whilst under confinement, concluding that \\"he was of sound mind and capable of appreciating the nature of his actions\\". On 6 December 1916 the case file was placed before the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, General Sir Douglas Haig, as the final authority in the matter, who confirmed the court martial's verdict and its sentence of death, noting in his private journal that it was 'highly important that all ranks should realise that the law is the same for an officer as a Private'.'The Private Papers of Douglas Haig 1914‚Äì1919', edited by Robert Blake (Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1952), P.183. Death On 10 December 1916 Poole was shot at dawn by a British Army firing squad at the town hall of Poperinghe in West Flanders, Belgium, at the age of 31 years.

Early life He was born in Rivi√®re-du-Loup, in the Province of Lower Canada (now Quebec), on 23 July 1823, the son of Charles Tach√©, a merchant, and Louise-Henriette de Labroquerie, a descendant of the famed explorers Louis Jolliet and Gaultier de Varennes. When his father died in January 1826, the Widow Tach√© was forced to return to her family home in Boucherville. The young Alexandre was raised there under the care of his uncle, in a home where the arts, study and the Catholic faith were part of the daily fabric of life. He attended the junior seminary at Saint-Hyacinthe starting in September 1833. While there Tach√© started to feel a religious calling, which was guided and supported by his mother and the faculty of the school. Deciding that he did want to become a priest, after graduation from the seminary, he entered the Major Seminary run by the Sulpician Fathers in Montreal, where he began his studies for ordination. There Tach√© made a strong impression on the staff and on Bishop Ignace Bourget of Montreal. Before he had even completed his theological studies, the bishop appointed him Regent of the College of Chambly, and in January 1844 as professor of mathematics at his old school in Saint-Hyacinthe. Since his meeting the newly arrived community of Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate from France in December 1841, Tach√© had felt drawn to their way of life. When he completed his seminary studies in 1844, he began to consider joining the congregation, feeling a desire to preach to the people of the West, who had been made known to the French colony by the explorations of his own ancestors. Despite the objections of his family (with the exception of his mother), he entered the Oblate novitiate in Longueuil in the fall of that year. Oblate missionary Tach√© soon expressed an urge to preach to the Native American population of the west. Upon completion of his novitiate in 1845, even though he was still only a subdeacon, he was sent by his superiors to Saint Boniface in the Red River Colony, now in the Province of Manitoba. He accompanied Father Pierre Aubert, O.M.I., who was to organize the Oblate mission in that region. They set out from Montreal on 25 June, travelling the entire distance of 1,400 miles to Saint Boniface by canoe, arriving on the following 25 August. They went to work with Bishop Joseph-Norbert Provencher, the new Vicar Apostolic of the Northwest Territories. Provencher ordained Tach√© a deacon a week later and a priest on 12 October 1845. Tach√© made his profession of vows as an Oblate the following day to Aubert. He studied the basics of the Ojibwe language and was sent to start a mission in √éle-√†-la- Crosse. Later, he also became proficient in Cree and Athabaskan. Bishop In 1847 the Holy See created the Diocese of Saint Boniface, and named Provencher its first bishop. In June 1850, Tach√© was named titular bishop of Arathia and Provencher's coadjutor bishop, when he was still only 27 years old. He did not receive the news of his appointment, however, until January 1851. He was consecrated a bishop on 23 November 1851 in Marseille, France, by St. Eugene de Mazenod, founder of the Missionary Oblates. Provencher died on 7 June 1853, and Tach√© automatically succeeded him as the Bishop of St. Boniface. The following years saw Tach√© serving a widespread region of which about half of the population were Catholics. He was involved in the difficult years when the Territories were absorbed into Canada. He also traveled to Europe, where he sought assistance from his congregation, funds and volunteers. The most prominent were Constantine Scollen and Emile Petitot who went to Canada with him in 1862. In the unrest among the M√©tis people in the political process, he was called upon by the federal government to act as its representative to avoid the possibility of a civil war. He was even called back by them from Rome in 1870, where he was participating in the First Vatican Council, to reach out to M√©tis leaders who were leading a rebellion against the Canadian government. However, the Oblate policy of encouraging Catholic families to settle in the homeland of the Metis and First Nations peoples meant that he had little influence and he was unable to prevent the Riel Rebellion of 1885. In September 1871, the Holy See raised the status of the diocese to that of archdiocese, and Tach√© became the first Archbishop of St. Boniface. He was keen to encourage Catholic families to settle in the North West and from 1872 used Fr Albert Lacombe as a recruiter of families from Eastern Canada and the United States and later Europe. Tach√© died in Saint Boniface in 1894. The Rural Municipality of Tache and Tache Avenue in Saint Boniface were named after him.

The company was originally named Pan-Canadian Film Distributors. In 1998, the company was sold off to Alliance Atlantis Communications, which eventually folded into Entertainment One. History The company began in 1979 as Pan-Canadian Film Distributors, a partnership between film producer Garth Drabinsky and inventor Nat Taylor, based in Toronto, Ontario. At the time of its establishment in the United States, the Cineplex Odeon theatre chain and the tie-in studio were owned by the MCA entertainment group, also the then-owners of Universal Pictures. On August 27, 1986, Pan-Canadian renamed itself as Cineplex Odeon Films, and began operations at Los Angeles, California in November 1986; Garth Drabinsky became its chief officer. By 1990, it was Canada's largest independent film distribution company. In December 1993, it was announced by Michael Herman (Cineplex Odeon Films Canada Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs) that as part of a corporate restructuring, Bryan Gliserman had been appointed to the role of Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs effective January 17, 1994. Gliserman would oversee all of Cineplex Odeon Films operations, and would be responsible for the maintenance and improvement of Cineplex Odeon Films distribution services. Gliserman would also build relationships with key suppliers like Columbia/Tri-Star, Savoy Pictures and Gramercy Pictures. Prior to his promotion, Gliserman had spent 17 years in the Canadian film industry. He had experience with development, financing, production, distribution and exhibition posts with a wide variety of organization. Later in the 1990s, it changed its name to Odeon Films on account of its historic significance, before releasing one of their final films‚Äîthe science-fiction film Cube (released in American markets under Trimark Pictures' banner). In early 1998, 75% of Cineplex Odeon Films was sold to Alliance Atlantis Communications for . The remaining 25% was donated to a foundation representing Canada's film schools. The sale took place as Cineplex Odeon Corporation was sold to Sony's Loews Theaters to form Loews Cineplex Entertainment. The sale was partly due to a Canadian law that forbids foreign companies from owning domestic distributors as the company was no longer Canadian.

A home video division was also started in 1986, previously known as Pan-Canadian Video Presentations in the early 80s. The company also had a home video deal with Universal with most titles released through their MCA Video banner in the US and Canada. The home video division lasted until 1998, when it was absorbed into Alliance Atlantis along with its film distribution counterpart. Cineplex Odeon worked with Universal for distributing and co-producing some of their notable productions in the US, such as The Glass Menagerie, The Last Temptation of Christ, Oliver Stone's Talk Radio, and Madame Sousatzka.

Diversity jurisdiction and federal-question jurisdiction (jurisdiction over issues arising under federal law) constitute the two primary categories of subject matter jurisdiction in U.S. federal courts. The United States Constitution, in Article III, Section 2, grants Congress the power to permit federal courts to hear diversity cases through legislation authorizing such jurisdiction. The provision was included because the Framers of the Constitution were concerned that when a case is filed in one state, and it involves parties from that state and another state, the state court might be biased toward the party from that state.Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, . In this decision, Justice Felix Frankfurter explained: \\"Diversity jurisdiction is founded on assurance to non-resident litigants of courts free from susceptibility to potential local bias. The Framers of the Constitution . . . entertained 'apprehensions' lest distant suitors be subjected to local bias in State courts, or, at least, viewed with 'indulgence the possible fears and apprehensions' of such suitors. [Citation.] And so Congress afforded out-of- State litigants another tribunal, not another body of law.\\" Congress first exercised that power and granted federal trial circuit courts diversity jurisdiction in the Judiciary Act of 1789. Diversity jurisdiction is currently codified at . In 1969, the American Law Institute explained in a 587-page analysis of the subject that diversity is the \\"most controversial\\" type of federal jurisdiction, because it \\"lays bare fundamental issues regarding the nature and operation of our federal union\\". Diversity of parties Mostly, in order for diversity jurisdiction to apply, complete diversity is required, where none of the plaintiffs can be from the same state as any of the defendants.Lincoln Property Co. v. Roche, . A corporation is treated as a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and the state in which its principal place of business is located.Danjaq, S.A. v. Pathe Comm'ns Corp., 979 F.2d 772 (9th Cir. 1992). A partnership or limited liability company is considered to have the citizenship of all of its constituent partners/members.Johnson v. Columbia Properties Anchorage, LP, 437 F.3d 894 (9th Cir. 2006). Thus, an LLC or partnership with one member or partner sharing citizenship with an opposing party will destroy diversity of jurisdiction. Cities and towns (incorporated municipalities) are also treated as citizens of the states in which they are located, but states themselves are not considered citizens for the purpose of diversity. U.S. citizens are citizens of the state in which they are domiciled, which is the last state in which they resided and had an intent to remain.Sun Printing & Publishing Association v. Edwards, . Though an alien (foreign national) who has been granted the status of permanent resident status used to be treated as a citizen of the state where the alien is domiciled, legislation proposed in July 2017 would eliminate this language from the code and add language specifically denying diversity jurisdiction in a claim between a citizen of a state and an alien permanent resident. A national bank chartered under the National Bank Act is treated as a citizen of the state in which it is \\"located.\\"28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1348. In 2006, the Supreme Court rejected an approach that would have interpreted the term \\"located\\" to mean that a national bank is a citizen of every state in which it maintains a branch.Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Schmidt, 546 U.S. 303, 307 (2006). The Supreme Court concluded that ‚Äúa national bank . . . is a citizen of the State in which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is located.‚Äù The Supreme Court, however, left open the possibility that a national bank may also be a citizen of the state in which it has its principal place of business, thus putting it on an equal footing with a state-formed corporation.Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Schmidt, 546 U.S. 303, 315 n.8, 317 n.9 (2006). This remains an open question, with some lower courts holding that a national bank is a citizen of only the state in which its main office is located, and others holding that a national bank is also a citizen of the state in which it has its principal place of business.Rouse v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB, 747 F.3d 707 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing cases on each side of circuit split and joining majority rule that national bank is only citizen of state in which main office is located). The diversity jurisdiction statute also allows federal courts to hear cases in which: *Citizens of a U.S. state are parties on one side of the case, with nonresident alien(s) as adverse parties; *Complete diversity exists as to the U.S. parties, and nonresident aliens are additional parties; *A foreign state (i.e., country) is the plaintiff, and the defendants are citizens of one or more U.S. states; or *Under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, a class action can usually be brought in a federal court when there is just minimal diversity, such that any plaintiff is a citizen of a different state from any defendant. Class actions that do not meet the requirement of the Class Action Fairness Act must have complete diversity between class representatives (those named in the lawsuit) and the defendants. A U.S. citizen who is domiciled outside the U.S. is not considered to be a citizen of any U.S. state, and cannot be considered an alien. The presence of such a person as a party completely destroys diversity jurisdiction, except for a class action or mass action in which minimal diversity exists with respect to other parties in the case. If the case requires the presence of a party who is from the same state as an opposing party, or a party who is a U.S. citizen domiciled outside the country, the case must be dismissed, the absent party being deemed \\"indispensable\\". The determination of whether a party is indispensable is made by the court following the guidelines set forth in Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. =Diversity is determined at the time that the action is filed= Diversity is determined at the time that the action is filed, and on the basis of the residency of the parties at that time. A change in domicile by a party before or after that date is irrelevant.LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95 (2nd Cir. 1999) However, in Caterpillar, Inc. v. Lewis (1996), the Supreme Court also held that federal jurisdiction predicated on diversity of citizenship can be sustained even if there did not exist complete diversity at the time of removal to federal court, so long as complete diversity exists at the time the district court enters judgment. The court in Caterpillar sustained diversity as an issue of \\"fairness\\" and economy, given a lower court's original mistake that allowed removal. =Corporate citizenship based on principal place of business= Congress never defined exactly what is a \\"principal place of business.\\" The question of what that phrase meant became hotly disputed during the late 20th century as many areas of the American economy came under the control of large national corporations. Although these corporations usually had a headquarters in one state, the majority of their employees, assets, and revenue were often physically located at retail sites in the states with the largest populations, and hence a circuit split developed in which some judges held that the latter states could also be treated as the corporation's principal place of business. The rationale was that those states were where the business was actually occurring or being transacted. This issue was finally resolved by a unanimous Supreme Court in Hertz Corp. v. Friend (2010), which held that a corporation's principal place of business is presumed to be the place of the corporation‚Äôs \\"nerve center\\" from where its officers conduct the corporation‚Äôs important business. Amount in controversy The United States Congress has placed an additional barrier to diversity jurisdiction, the amount in controversy requirement. This is a minimum amount of money which the parties must be contesting is owed to them. Since the enactment of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß1332(a) has provided that a claim for relief must exceed the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs and without considering counterclaims. In other words, the amount in controversy must be equal to or more than $75,000.01, and (in a case which has been removed from a state court to the federal court) a federal court must remand a case back to state court if the amount in controversy is exactly $75,000.00.Freeland v. Liberty Mutual Fire. Ins. Co., 632 F.3d 250 (6th Cir. 2011). A plaintiff may add different claims against the same defendant to meet the amount. Two plaintiffs, however, may not join their claims together to meet the amount, but if one plaintiff meets the amount standing alone, the second plaintiff can piggyback as long as the second plaintiff's claim arises out of the same facts as the main claim. More detailed information may be obtained from the article on federal supplemental jurisdiction. The amount specified has been regularly increased over the past two centuries. Courts will use the legal certainty test to decide whether the dispute is over $75,000. Under this test, the court will accept the pled amount unless it is legally certain that the pleading party cannot recover more than $75,000. For example, if the dispute is solely over the breach of a contract by which the defendant had agreed to pay the plaintiff $10,000, a federal court will dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or remand the case to state court if it arrived via removal. In personal injury cases, plaintiffs will sometimes claim amounts \\"not to exceed $75,000\\" in their complaint to avoid removal of the case to federal court. If the amount is left unspecified in the ad damnum, as is required by the pleading rules of many states, the defendant may sometimes be able to remove the case to federal court unless the plaintiff's lawyer files a document expressly disclaiming damages in excess of the jurisdictional requirement. Because juries decide what personal injuries are worth, compensation for injuries may exceed $75,000 such that the \\"legal certainty\\" test will not bar federal court jurisdiction. Many plaintiffs' lawyers seek to avoid federal courts because of the perception that they are more hostile to plaintiffs than most state courts. =Domestic relations and probate exceptions= A longstanding judge-made rule holds that federal courts have no jurisdiction over divorce or other domestic relations cases, even if there is diversity of citizenship between the parties and the amount of money in controversy meets the jurisdictional limit. As the Supreme Court has stated, \\"[t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the states, and not to the laws of the United States.\\"Ex parte Burrus, 136 U.S. 586, 593-594 (1890). The court concluded \\"that the domestic relations exception ... divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees.\\" In explaining this exception, the high court noted that domestic cases frequently required the issuing court to retain jurisdiction over recurring disputes in interpreting and enforcing those decrees. State courts have developed expertise in dealing with these matters, and the interest of judicial economy required keeping that litigation in the courts most experienced to handle it. However, federal courts are not limited in their ability to hear tort cases arising out of domestic situations by the doctrine.Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 694-695 (1992) A similar exception has been recognized for probate and decedent's estate litigation, which continues to hold for the primary cases; diversity jurisdiction does not exist to probate wills or administer decedent's estates directly. Diversity jurisdiction is allowed for some litigation that arises under trusts and other estate planning documents, however.Marshall v. Marshall, 547 U.S. 293 (2006). Removal and remand If a case is originally filed in a state court, and the requirements for federal jurisdiction are met (diversity and amount in controversy, the case involves a federal question, or a supplemental jurisdiction exists), the defendant (and only the defendant) may remove the case to a federal court. A case cannot be removed to a state court. To remove to a federal court, the defendant must file a notice of removal with both the state court where the case was filed and the federal court to which it will be transferred. The notice of removal must be filed within 30 days of the first removable document. For example, if there is no diversity of citizenship initially, but the non-diverse defendant is subsequently dismissed, the remaining diverse defendant(s) may remove to a federal court. However, no removal is available after one year of the filing of the complaint. A party's citizenship at the time of the filing of the action is considered the citizenship of the party. If a defendant later moves to the same state as the plaintiff while the action is pending, the federal court will still have jurisdiction. However, if any defendant is a citizen of the state where the action is first filed, diversity does not exist. 28 U.S.C. ¬ß1441(b). If a plaintiff or a co-defendant opposes removal, he may request a remand, asking the federal court to send the case back to the state court. A remand is rarely granted if the diversity and amount in controversy requirements are met. A remand may be granted, however, if a non-diverse party joins the action, or if the parties settle some claims among them, leaving the amount in controversy below the requisite amount. Law applied The United States Supreme Court determined in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938) that the law to be applied in a diversity case would be the law of whatever state in which the action was filed. This decision overturned precedents that had held that federal courts could create a general federal common law, instead of applying the law of the forum state. This decision was an interpretation of the word \\"laws\\" in 28 U.S.C. 1652, known as the Rules of Decision Act, to mean not just statutes enacted by the legislature but also the common law created by state courts. Under the Rules of Decision Act, the laws of the several states, except where the constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. The Court interpreted \\"laws\\" to include the states' judicial decisions, or \\"common law.\\" Thus, it is an overstatement to state that Erie represents the notion that there is no federal common law. Federal courts do adjudicate \\"common law\\" of federal statutes and regulations. Because the RDA provides for exceptions and modifications by Congress, it is important to note the effect of the Rules Enabling Act (REA), 28 U.S.C. 2072. The REA delegates the legislative authority to the Supreme Court to ratify rules of practice and procedure and rules of evidence for federal courts. Thus, it is not Erie, but the REA, which created the distinction between substantive and procedural law. Thus, while state substantive law is applied, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence still govern the \\"procedural\\" matters in a diversity action, as clarified in Gasperini v. Center for Humanities (1996). The REA, 28 U.S.C. 2072(b), provides that the Rules will not affect the substantive rights of the parties. Therefore, a federal court may still apply the \\"procedural\\" rules of the state of the initial filing, if the federal law would \\"abridge, enlarge, or modify\\" a substantive right provided for under the law of the state.

The story was originally published, in a slightly different form, as \\"That Evening Sun Go Down\\" in The American Mercury in March of the same year. \\"That Evening Sun\\" is a dark portrait of white Southerners' indifference to the crippling fears of one of their black employees, Nancy. The story is narrated by Quentin Compson, one of Faulkner's most memorable characters, and concerns the reactions of him and his two siblings, Caddy and Jason, to an adult world that they do not fully understand. The black washerwoman, Nancy Mannigoe, fears that her common-law husband Jesus is seeking to murder her because she is pregnant with a white man's child. Plot summary Quentin narrates the story in the turn of the century, presumably at age twenty-four (although in The Sound and the Fury he commits suicide at age nineteen), telling of events that took place fifteen years before. Nancy is an African-American washerwoman working for Quentin's family since their regular cook, Dilsey, is taken sick. Jesus, Nancy's common- law husband, suspects that she is pregnant with a white man's child and leaves her. At first Nancy is only worried about going home at night and running into Jesus, but later she is paralyzed with the fear that he will kill her, having delusions of him being hidden in a ditch outside her house. Quentin and his siblings witness all of this, given that they are present for every major conversation between their father and Nancy. Mr. Compson tries to help her up to a certain extent, first by taking her home at night despite the fact that Mrs. Compson feels jealous and insecure that her husband is more worried about protecting some \\"Negro woman\\" than herself. He puts her up one night at Quentin and Caddy's room when she is too afraid to stay alone in the kitchen. The kids, however, have no idea of what's going on, and cannot understand Nancy's fear. As the narrative progresses, Nancy becomes crippled by her fear. One night she feels so impotent that she talks the kids into going home with her. There, she is not able to attend to them, tell them proper stories or even make them some popcorn. Jason, the youngest, starts to cry. Their father arrives and tries to talk some sense into Nancy, who fears Jesus will come out of the darkness of the ditch outside as soon as they go away. The story ends as the father walks the children back‚Äînot the least bit affected by Nancy's situation, the kids still teasing each other and the father scolding them. It is left ambiguous as to whether Nancy survives the night. However, in The Sound and the Fury, Benjy refers to Nancy's bones lying in the ditch, although she was \\"shot by Roskus\\" and it is implied that Nancy is the name of a horse.  The title  The title is thought to be taken from the song Saint Louis Blues, originally composed by W.C. Handy, but popularized by Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong in 1927. It begins with the line: \\"Lordy, how I hate to see that evening sun go down\\". The title implies that once the sun sets, death is sure to follow. Faulkner first came across Handy's music when the latter played dances in Oxford, Mississippi. Though the song is never explicitly referenced in the text, Faulkner employs a number of blues tropes to structure the plot and develop racial stereotypes. Scholar Ken Bennett notes that \\"the image of the 'evening sun' is a common one in black religious music. For example, the spiritual It's Gettin' Late Over in the Evenin', the Sun Most Down, based on Revelation 20, uses the image of the evening sun to suggest the coming of death and judgment.\\"Bennett, Ken. \\"The Language of the Blues in Faulkner‚Äôs 'That Evening Sun.'\\" Mississippi Quarterly: The Journal of Southern Culture 38.3 (Summer 1985):339-42. Variation In manuscript form, the story was written from Nancy's perspective and titled \\"Never Done No Weeping When You Wanted to Laugh.\\" This story appears as \\"That Evening Sun Go Down\\" in The Best American Short Stories of the Century by John Updike, Katrina Kenison. In this version of the story, Nancy's husband is called \\"Jubah\\", not Jesus, although a frightened Nancy whispers the word \\"Jesus\\" three times in Part II when Caddy is interrogating her. The substitution of Jubah for Jesus likely was made for censorship reasons. In the original magazine publication of the story, his name was rendered as \\"Jubah.\\" J.D. Salinger, in his 1964 essay \\"A Salute to Whit Burnett\\" (the editor of Story Magazine, Burnett was Salinger's mentor whose class in short story writing at Columbia University he attended in 1939 and who was the first professional to publish one of his stories), said that it was Burnett's use of \\"That Evening Sun Gone Down\\" in the class that taught him the importance of the author's relationship with his \\"silent reader\\".Salinger, J.D. \\"A Salute to Whit Burnett\\", Fiction Writers Handbook (New York: Harper & Row, 1975) Nancy's bones appear in The Sound and the Fury, but she is resurrected entirely as a Nun in Requiem for a Nun. Faulkner responded to a question about the story and the novel in Charlottesville by saying Nancy was ‚Äúthe same person, actually‚Äù in both texts, though he qualified his comment by adding, ‚ÄúThese people I figure belong to me and I have the right to move them about in time when I need them‚Äù (FU79). To what extent and in what ways we ought to read Nancy, Quentin, and the others as ‚Äúthe same‚Äù from appearance to appearance thus remain issues open for debate.

Unlike the Austin- designed A-Series and B-Series engines, it came from the Morris Engines drawing office in Coventry and therefore differed significantly in its layout and design from the two other designs which were closely related. This was due to the C-Series being in essence an enlarged overhead valve development of the earlier 2.2 L Straight-6 overhead camshaft engine used in the post-war Morris Six MS and Wolseley 6/80 from 1948 until 1954, which itself also formed the basis of a related 1.5 L 4-cylinder engine for the Morris Oxford MO in side- valve form and the Wolseley 4/50 in overhead camshaft form. Displacement was 2.6 to 2.9 L with an undersquare stroke of , bored out to increase capacity. Mission The revised engine was required to replace BMC's inherited diverse collection of engines made to prewar designs and Austin's wartime designed four-cylinder BS1. A long-stroke engine, though closer to square than BMC contemporaries, with a cast iron block and cylinder head using Weslake patents, its overhead valves were operated by pushrods. Previously, Rileys used high-mounted twin camshafts with short pushrods, and Wolseleys used single overhead camshafts. The twin-cam Riley and OHC Wolseley engines were expensive to make, sold in low volumes and both had had reliability problems, especially with overheating valves under sustained high loads. The brief for the C-Series was to be a more conventional design that was easy to build and service, more refined than the existing big Austin four-cylinder power units and with an emphasis on reliability and a long service life. At the design stage high performance was not foreseen as BMC had no sporting models of a size requiring an engine like the C-Series. The biggest design difference between the Morris-designed C-Series and the Austin-penned A- and B-Series engines was the position of the camshaft - on the right-hand side of the block (as viewed from within the car) rather than the left, although all three engines had their inlet and exhaust ports on the left. This meant that the C-Series didn't require the compound ports of the Austin engines, which were partly required to provide space in the cylinder head for the pushrods. This should, theoretically, have provided the C-Series with superior 'breathing' and efficiency than the smaller engines since it still used the same highly- effective heart-shaped Combustion chamber design by Harry Weslake. However this was undermined by the carburettor arrangements; instead of a dedicated intake manifold the C-Series was designed with an intake gallery cast into the cylinder head, with the carburettor(s) attached directly to the intake(s). This design was chosen for ease of construction and to allow different carburettor arrangements to be easily accommodated and the design also eliminated carburettor icing. Each cylinder had a generous-sized intake port from the gallery but the restrictive shape of the gallery and the carburettor port(s) severely limited the engine's maximum power output and speed, as did the four-bearing crankshaft. There appear to have been plans for a twin cam variant of the C-Series, using the same basic head and valve design as the DOHC B-Series in the MGA Twin Cam for use in Rileys and Wolseleys. This explains the relatively unadventurous design of the standard engine. However the reliability problems of the twin-cam B-Series and the mixed reception of the Riley Pathfinder discouraged BMC from pursuing this development and work stopped in 1955. Other signs of the Morris origins of the design were the crankcase being cast with strengthening ribs (a feature not introduced to the A-Series until 1980) and the big end bearings being split diagonally rather than horizontally. The C-Series also had a hydraulic tensioning unit for its timing chain and had the oil pump and distributor driven via separate sets of skew-cut gears on the camshaft. This was relatively unusual for mass-produced engines of the time; the A- and B-Series engines, and most of their contemporaries, had both oil pump and distributor driven by one shaft driven from one skew gear. The C-Series' arrangement reduced load on the gears and therefore wear, preventing the ignition timing falling out of specification over time. Given the design emphasis on durability and ease of manufacture, the C-Series has always been considered an engine that was both large and heavy for its capacity and power output, initially proving to have little benefit, aside from the greater refinement of six-cylinders, over the Austin- designed four-cylinder 2.6-litre BS1 engine installed in the Austin A90 Atlantic and Austin-Healey 100. Austin's engineers attributed this to the poor cylinder head design. In 1957 the Healey was given a twelve-port head with a conventional intake manifold, increasing output by or fifteen percent. In 1959 carburettors were revised and replaced. In 1961 the inlet tract was improved, exhaust timing was adjusted, and twin exhausts added. Later in 1961 the saloon engines were slightly detuned and the Healey version's performance upgraded, probably by Weslake. Then the Austin Healey Mark III was announced. Riley Big Four 1937-1938 The C-Series was also less efficient than, and in engineering terms was a retrograde step from Nuffield's engines: the Riley-designed Riley 2¬Ω-litre Big Four twin-cam four-cylinder unit fitted in the Riley RM series, and Riley's prewar cars, and the Wolseley designed Wolseley 2.2-litre straight six with a single overhead camshaft used in the Morris Six MS version of the Wolseley 6/80 which dated back to the early 1920s. The Austin BS1 had begun as a late wartime Rix and Bareham design, two-thirds of a Bedford-based wartime truck engine, for a 2.2-litre ohv unit intended for a British jeep which became the civilian Austin Champ. Its use spread to Austin's Sixteen, their light commercial vehicles and the FX3 taxi.Time for Sixteens to come of age. Martyn Nutland. Austin Times, April 2003, Volume 1, Issue 1.

The four-bearing engine was also limited as to its maximum rotational speed due to the relative lack of crankshaft support. With demand for the Austin-Healey 3000 still strong and development of what would become the Austin 3-Litre underway BMC carried out a thorough redesign of the C-Series with the aim of improving the power output and reducing both the engine's weight and its overall size. The engine was reworked to carry seven main bearings (each reduced in width compared to those in the four-bearing version), steel ancillary castings were swapped for aluminium alloy ones where possible. The main block and cylinder head castings were extensively redesigned while retaining the same cylinder capacity of - the bores were now evenly spaced and had coolant gallery between all six bores while the original C-Series featured three pairs of 'siamesed' bores without coolant between the bores in each pair. Similarly, the new cylinder head had the Weslake combustion chambers located symmetrically and centralised on each bore, instead of being offset to the exhaust side as on the original engine. While both these changes, and the increased number of bearings, added to the overall volume taken up by the engine's main interal parts, the outer coolant galleries of the block were made slimmer and the main castings themselves were thinner, so the redesigned engine was actually 1.75 inches (4.45cm) shorter in overall length than the older version. The manifolds were altered for more efficient 'breathing', especially at high engine speeds. BMC aimed for a 30 per cent weight reduction at and a maximum reliable power output in competition tune of around . In the event a minimal weight saving was returned - the revised engine was only lighter than the old version. The main identifying feature of the 'mark 2' C-Series engine is the much narrower Rocker cover, which is only around half the width of the cylinder head, whereas the original engine has nearly full-width cover. By the time the new engine was available the Austin-Healey 3000 had been dropped and was replaced by the MGC. No real use was made of the revised engine's greater strength and the power outputs were broadly similar to the original 2.9-litre engine at . This was slightly less than the maximum output acheived by the older engine in the Austin-Healey 3000, the decrease being blamed on the greater internal friction due to the greater number of main bearings coupled to the same carburation and tuning being carried over from the original engine. 1968 MGC GT =Applications 3= * 2.9 L (2,912 cc) - Seven bearing crankshaft ** 1967-1971 29AA Austin 3-Litre - ** 1967-1970 29GA MGC - Racing engines Much of the potential in the revised C-Series was demonstrated by the six specialised racing versions of the MGC built for 12 Hours of Sebring races in 1968 and 1969. These cars, dubbed the MGC GTS, used special versions of the C-Series engine. The first car was built with an engine where both the head and the block were cast in aluminium alloy but this proved troublesome and all the cars eventually used the standard iron block with an alloy head. The head had a higher compression ratio, larger valves (from the Ford Essex V6), revised porting and redesigned exhaust system as well as using triple twin- choke Weber carburetors. These specialised versions of the C-Series made an easy and reliable with a weight loss similar that hoped for in the redesign process. However the inherent cost of these engines and the commercial failure of both the MGC and the Austin 3-Litre meant that none of these alterations were considered for the production units. End of run As an all-iron, overhead-valve engine, the C-Series was becoming outdated in terms of its construction and power-to-weight ratio. These factors were significant contributors to the poor sales performance of the last two cars it was installed in. It was effectively replaced, after a short hiatus, by 2.2 and 2.6-litre straight-six versions of the E-Series engine, introduced in 1972. The E-Series provided larger capacity six-cylinder engines made on the same tooling as the four-cylinders.  Japan  In the 1950s, Nissan of Japan licence-built the Austin A40 and A50 with their B-Series engines. In later years, this engine was fitted to Nissan's own designs of light trucks. The B-series engine was developed further in Japan, particularly to redesign the perennially leaking rear crankshaft seal. This improved engine was known as the 'C Series' or eponymously as the 'Stone engine' after its designer. This overlapping name has led to a persistent myth that the six cylinder C-Series engine was also licence-built in Japan; it was not. Nissan would later become known for their own design of inline six, used in the Nissan Z-car. Although this sports car concept traced its heritage from the big Austin-Healeys, the new SOHC engine had no inheritance from the Austin C-series engine.

Schematic representation of a Sagnac interferometer. The Sagnac effect, also called Sagnac interference, named after French physicist Georges Sagnac, is a phenomenon encountered in interferometry that is elicited by rotation. The Sagnac effect manifests itself in a setup called a ring interferometer. A beam of light is split and the two beams are made to follow the same path but in opposite directions. On return to the point of entry the two light beams are allowed to exit the ring and undergo interference. The relative phases of the two exiting beams, and thus the position of the interference fringes, are shifted according to the angular velocity of the apparatus. In other words, when the interferometer is at rest with respect to a nonrotating frame, the light takes the same amount of time to traverse the ring in either direction. However, when the interferometer system is spun, one beam of light has a longer path to travel than the other in order to complete one circuit of the mechanical frame, and so takes longer, resulting in a phase difference between the two beams. This arrangement is also called a Sagnac interferometer. Georges Sagnac set up this experiment to prove the existence of the aether that Einstein's theory of special relativity had discarded. A gimbal mounted mechanical gyroscope remains pointing in the same direction after spinning up, and thus can be used as a rotational reference for an inertial navigation system. With the development of so-called laser gyroscopes and fiber optic gyroscopes based on the Sagnac effect, the bulky mechanical gyroscope is replaced by one having no moving parts in many modern inertial navigation systems. The principles behind the two devices are different, however. A conventional gyroscope relies on the principle of conservation of angular momentum whereas the sensitivity of the ring interferometer to rotation arises from the invariance of the speed of light for all inertial frames of reference. Description and operation guided wave Sagnac interferometer, or fibre optic gyroscope, can be realized using an optical fiber in a single or multiple loops. Typically three or more mirrors are used, so that counter-propagating light beams follow a closed path such as a triangle or square.(Fig. 1) Alternatively fiber optics can be employed to guide the light through a closed path.(Fig. 2) If the platform on which the ring interferometer is mounted is rotating, the interference fringes are displaced compared to their position when the platform is not rotating. The amount of displacement is proportional to the angular velocity of the rotating platform. The axis of rotation does not have to be inside the enclosed area. The phase shift of the interference fringes is proportional to the platform's angular frequency \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} and is given by a formula originally derived by Sagnac:\\\\Delta \\\\phi\\\\approx \\\\frac {8 \\\\pi} {\\\\lambda c}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A} where \\\\mathbf{A} is the oriented area of the loop and \\\\lambda the wavelength of light. The effect is a consequence of the different times it takes right and left moving light beams to complete a full round trip in the interferometer ring. The difference in travel times, when multiplied by the optical frequency c / \\\\lambda, determines the phase difference \\\\Delta \\\\phi. The rotation thus measured is an absolute rotation, that is, the platform's rotation with respect to an inertial reference frame.  History of aether experiments  Early suggestions to build a giant ring interferometer to measure the rotation of the Earth were made by Oliver Lodge in 1897, and then by Albert Abraham Michelson in 1904. They hoped that with such an interferometer, it would be possible to decide between the idea of a stationary aether, and an aether which is completely dragged by the Earth. That is, if the hypothetical aether were carried along by the Earth (or by the interferometer) the result would be negative, while a stationary aether would give a positive result. An experiment conducted in 1911 by Franz Harress, aimed at making measurements of the Fresnel drag of light propagating through moving glass, was in 1920 recognized by Max von Laue as actually constituting a Sagnac experiment. Not aware of the Sagnac effect, Harress had realized the presence of an \\"unexpected bias\\" in his measurements, but was unable to explain its cause. English translation: On the Experiment of F. Harress The first description of the Sagnac effect in the framework of special relativity was done by Laue in 1911, English translation: On an Experiment on the Optics of Moving Bodies two years before Sagnac conducted his experiment. By continuing the theoretical work of Michelson (1904), von Laue confined himself to an inertial frame of reference (which he called a \\"valid\\" reference frame), and in a footnote he wrote \\"a system which rotates in respect to a valid system K^0 is not valid\\". Assuming constant light speed c, and setting the rotational velocity as \\\\omega, he computed the propagation time \\\\tau_{+} of one ray and \\\\tau_{-} of the counter-propagating ray, and consequently obtained the time difference \\\\Delta\\\\tau=\\\\tau_{+}-\\\\tau_{-}. He concluded that this interferometer experiment would indeed produce (when restricted to terms of first order in v/c) the same positive result for both special relativity and the stationary aether (the latter he called \\"absolute theory\\" in reference to the 1895-theory of Lorentz). He also concluded that only complete-aether-drag models (such as the ones of Stokes or Hertz) would give a negative result. In practice, the first interferometry experiment aimed at observing the correlation of angular velocity and phase-shift was performed by the French scientist Georges Sagnac in 1913. Its purpose was to detect \\"the effect of the relative motion of the ether\\". Sagnac believed that his results constituted proof of the existence of a stationary aether. However, as explained above, Max von Laue already showed in 1911 that this effect is consistent with special relativity. Unlike the carefully prepared Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment which was set up to prove an aether wind caused by earth drag, the Sagnac experiment could not prove this type of aether wind because a universal aether would affect all parts of the rotating light equally. Einstein was fully aware of the phenomenon of the Sagnac effect through the earlier experimentation of Franz Harress, mathematically analyzed in an article by Paul Harzer, entitled \\"Dragging of Light in Glass and Aberration\\" in 1914.List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein This was rebutted by Einstein in his articles \\"Observation on P. Harzer's Article: Dragging of Light in Glass and Aberration\\"Astronomische Nachrichten, 199, 8‚Äì10 and \\"Answer to P. Harzer's Reply.\\"Astronomische Nachrichten, 199, 47‚Äì48 After Einstein's mathematical argument in the first article, Einstein replied, \\"As I have shown, the frequency of the light relative to the medium through which it is applied is decisive for the magnitude k; because this determines the speed of the light relative to the medium. In our case, it is a light process which, in relation to the rotating prism system, is to be understood as a stationary process. From this it follows that the frequency of the light relative to the moving prisms, and also the magnitude k, is the same for all prisms. This repudiates Mr Harzer's reply.\\" (1914) In 1920 von Laue continued his own theoretical work of 1911, describing the Harress experiment and showing the role of the Sagnac effect in this experiment. Laue said that in the Harress experiment (in which light traverses glass) there was a calculable difference in time due to both the dragging of light (which follows from the relativistic velocity addition in moving media, i.e. in moving glass) and \\"the fact that every part of the rotating apparatus runs away from one ray, while it approaches the other one\\", i.e. the Sagnac effect. He acknowledged that this latter effect alone could cause the time variance and, therefore, \\"the accelerations connected with the rotation in no way influence the speed of light.\\" While Laue's explanation is based on inertial frames, Paul Langevin (1921, 1937) and others described the same effect when viewed from rotating reference frames (in both special and general relativity, see Born coordinates). So when the Sagnac effect should be described from the viewpoint of a corotating frame, one can use ordinary rotating cylindrical coordinates and apply them to the Minkowski metric, which results into the so-called Born metric or Langevin metric. (Open access)L.D. Landau, E.M. Lifshitz, (1962). \\"The Classical Theory of Fields\\". 2nd edition, Pergamon Press, pp. 296‚Äì297. From these coordinates, one can derive the different arrival times of counter-propagating rays, an effect which was shown by Paul Langevin (1921). Or when these coordinates are used to compute the global speed of light in rotating frames, different apparent light speeds are derived depending on the orientation, an effect which was shown by Langevin in another paper (1937). This does not contradict special relativity and the above explanation by von Laue that the speed of light is not affected by accelerations. Because this apparent variable light speed in rotating frames only arises if rotating coordinates are used, whereas if the Sagnac effect is described from the viewpoint of an external inertial coordinate frame the speed of light of course remains constant ‚Äì so the Sagnac effect arises no matter whether one uses inertial coordinates (see the formulas in section below) or rotating coordinates (see the formulas in section below). That is, special relativity in its original formulation was adapted to inertial coordinate frames, not rotating frames. Albert Einstein in his paper introducing special relativity stated, \\"light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.\\"Albert Einstein, 1905, \\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.\\" http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ Einstein specifically stated that light speed is only constant in the vacuum of empty space, using equations that only held in linear and parallel inertial frames. However, when Einstein started to investigate accelerated reference frames, he noticed that ‚Äúthe principle of the constancy of light must be modified‚Äù for accelerating frames of reference.A. Einstein, ‚ÄòGeneralized theory of relativity‚Äô, 94; the anthology ‚ÄòThe Principle of Relativity‚Äô, A. Einstein and H. Minkowski, University of Calcutta, 1920 Max von Laue in his 1920 paper gave serious consideration to the effect of General Relativity on the Sagnac effect stating, \\"General relativity would of course be capable of giving some statements about it, and we want to show at first that no noticeable influences of acceleration are expected according to it.\\" He makes a footnote regarding discussions with German physicist, Wilhelm Wien. The reason for looking at General Relativity is because Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicted that light would slow down in a gravitational field which is why it could predict the curvature of light around a massive body. Under General Relativity, there is the equivalence principle which states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent. Spinning or accelerating an interferometer creates a gravitational effect. \\"There are, however, two different types of such [non-inertial] motion; it may for instance be acceleration in a straight line, or circular motion with constant speed.\\"\\"General Relativity\\", Lewis Ryder, Cambridge University Press (2009). P.7 Also, Irwin Shapiro in 1964 explained General Relativity saying, \\"the speed of a light wave depends on the strength of the gravitational potential along its path.\\" This is called the Shapiro delay.http://www.physicsdiscussionforum.org/download/file.php?id=250 However, since the gravitational field would have to be significant, Laue (1920) concluded it is more likely that the effect is a result of changing the distance of the path by its movement through space. \\"The beam traveling around the loop in the direction of rotation will have farther to go than the beam traveling counter to the direction of rotation, because during the period of travel the mirrors and detector will all move (slightly) toward the counter- rotating beam and away from the co-rotating beam. Consequently the beams will reach the detector at slightly different times, and slightly out of phase, producing optical interference 'fringes' that can be observed and measured.\\" In 1926, an ambitious ring interferometry experiment was set up by Albert Michelson and Henry Gale. The aim was to find out whether the rotation of the Earth has an effect on the propagation of light in the vicinity of the Earth. The Michelson‚ÄìGale‚ÄìPearson experiment was a very large ring interferometer, (a perimeter of 1.9 kilometer), large enough to detect the angular velocity of the Earth. The outcome of the experiment was that the angular velocity of the Earth as measured by astronomy was confirmed to within measuring accuracy. The ring interferometer of the Michelson‚ÄìGale experiment was not calibrated by comparison with an outside reference (which was not possible, because the setup was fixed to the Earth). From its design it could be deduced where the central interference fringe ought to be if there would be zero shift. The measured shift was 230 parts in 1000, with an accuracy of 5 parts in 1000. The predicted shift was 237 parts in 1000. = The Wang experiment = Modified versions of the Sagnac experiment have been made by Wang et al. in configurations similar to those shown in Fig. 3\\\\. Figure 3.

Consider a ring interferometer where two counter-propagating light beams share a common optical path determined by a loop of an optical fiber, see Figure 4. The loop may have an arbitrary shape, and can move arbitrarily in space. The only restriction is that it is not allowed to stretch. (The case of a circular ring interferometer rotating about its center in free space is recovered by taking the index of refraction of the fiber to be 1.) Consider a small segment of the fiber, whose length in its rest frame is d\\\\ell'. The time intervals, dt'_\\\\pm, it takes the left and right moving light rays to traverse the segment in the rest frame coincide and are given bydt'_\\\\pm={n \\\\over c} d \\\\ell'Let d\\\\ell=d\\\\mathbf{x} be the length of this small segment in the lab frame. By the relativistic length contraction formula, d\\\\ell'=\\\\gamma d\\\\ell\\\\approx d\\\\ell correct to first order in the velocity \\\\mathbf{v} of the segment. The time intervals dt_\\\\pm for traversing the segment in the lab frame are given by Lorentz transformation as:dt_\\\\pm=\\\\gamma \\\\left(dt' \\\\pm \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{x}'}{c^2}\\\\right)\\\\approx \\\\frac n c d\\\\ell \\\\pm \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}}{c^2}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{x}correct to first order in the velocity \\\\mathbf{v}. In general, the two beams will visit a given segment at slightly different times, but, in the absence of stretching, the length d\\\\ell is the same for both beams. It follows that the time difference for completing a cycle for the two beams is\\\\Delta T= \\\\int \\\\left(dt_+-dt_-\\\\right)\\\\approx \\\\frac 2 {c^2} \\\\oint \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{x}Remarkably, the time difference is independent of the refraction index n and the velocity of light in the fiber. Imagine a screen for viewing fringes placed at the light source (alternatively, use a beamsplitter to send light from the source point to the screen). Given a steady light source, interference fringes will form on the screen with a fringe displacement given by \\\\Delta \\\\phi\\\\approx \\\\frac {2\\\\pi c} {\\\\lambda} \\\\Delta T where the first factor is the frequency of light. This gives the generalized Sagnac formula\\\\Delta \\\\phi\\\\approx \\\\frac {4\\\\pi} {\\\\lambda c} \\\\oint \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{x}In the special case that the fiber moves like a rigid body with angular frequency \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}, the velocity is \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{x} and the line integral can be computed in terms of the area of the loop:\\\\oint\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\oint\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{x}= \\\\oint\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\times d\\\\mathbf{x}=2\\\\oint\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{A}= 2\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A}This gives Sagnac formula for ring interferometers of arbitrary shape and geometry\\\\Delta \\\\phi\\\\approx \\\\frac {8 \\\\pi} {\\\\lambda c}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A} If one also allows for stretching one recovers the Fizeau interference formula. The Sagnac effect has stimulated a century long debate on its meaning and interpretation, much of this debate being surprising since the effect is perfectly well understood in the context of special relativity. = Other generalizations = A relay of pulses that circumnavigates the Earth, verifying precise synchronization, is also recognized as a case requiring correction for the Sagnac effect. In 1984 a verification was set up that involved three ground stations and several GPS satellites, with relays of signals both going eastward and westward around the world. In the case of a Sagnac interferometer a measure of difference in arrival time is obtained by producing interference fringes, and observing the fringe shift. In the case of a relay of pulses around the world the difference in arrival time is obtained directly from the actual arrival time of the pulses. In both cases the mechanism of the difference in arrival time is the same: the Sagnac effect. The Hafele‚ÄìKeating experiment is also recognized as a counterpart to Sagnac effect physics. In the actual Hafele‚ÄìKeating experiment the mode of transport (long-distance flights) gave rise to time dilation effects of its own, and calculations were needed to separate the various contributions. For the (theoretical) case of clocks that are transported so slowly that time dilation effects arising from the transport are negligible the amount of time difference between the clocks when they arrive back at the starting point will be equal to the time difference that is found for a relay of pulses that travels around the world: 207 nanoseconds. = Practical uses = The Sagnac effect is employed in current technology. One use is in inertial guidance systems. Ring laser gyroscopes are extremely sensitive to rotations, which need to be accounted for if an inertial guidance system is to return accurate results. The ring laser also can detect the sidereal day, which can also be termed \\"mode 1\\". Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), such as GPS, GLONASS, COMPASS or Galileo, need to take the rotation of the Earth into account in the procedures of using radio signals to synchronize clocks. = Ring lasers = Figure 6. Schematic representation of a ring laser setup. Fibre optic gyroscopes are sometimes referred to as 'passive ring interferometers'. A passive ring interferometer uses light entering the setup from outside. The interference pattern that is obtained is a fringe pattern, and what is measured is a phase shift. It is also possible to construct a ring interferometer that is self-contained, based on a completely different arrangement. This is called a ring laser or ring laser gyroscope. The light is generated and sustained by incorporating laser excitation in the path of the light. To understand what happens in a ring laser cavity, it is helpful to discuss the physics of the laser process in a laser setup with continuous generation of light. As the laser excitation is started, the molecules inside the cavity emit photons, but since the molecules have a thermal velocity, the light inside the laser cavity is at first a range of frequencies, corresponding to the statistical distribution of velocities. The process of stimulated emission makes one frequency quickly outcompete other frequencies, and after that the light is very close to monochromatic. Figure 7. Schematic representation of the frequency shift when a ring laser interferometer is rotating. Both the counterpropagating light and the co- propagating light go through 12 cycles of their frequency. For the sake of simplicity, assume that all emitted photons are emitted in a direction parallel to the ring. Fig. 7 illustrates the effect of the ring laser's rotation. In a linear laser, an integer multiple of the wavelength fits the length of the laser cavity. This means that in traveling back and forth the laser light goes through an integer number of cycles of its frequency. In the case of a ring laser the same applies: the number of cycles of the laser light's frequency is the same in both directions. This quality of the same number of cycles in both directions is preserved when the ring laser setup is rotating. The image illustrates that there is wavelength shift (hence a frequency shift) in such a way that the number of cycles is the same in both directions of propagation. By bringing the two frequencies of laser light to interference a beat frequency can be obtained; the beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies. This beat frequency can be thought of as an interference pattern in time. (The more familiar interference fringes of interferometry are a spatial pattern). The period of this beat frequency is linearly proportional to the angular velocity of the ring laser with respect to inertial space. This is the principle of the ring laser gyroscope, widely used in modern inertial navigation systems.  Zero point calibration  Figure 8. The red and blue dots represent counter-propagating photons, the grey dots represent molecules in the laser cavity. In passive ring interferometers, the fringe displacement is proportional to the first derivative of angular position; careful calibration is required to determine the fringe displacement that corresponds to zero angular velocity of the ring interferometer setup. On the other hand, ring laser interferometers do not require calibration to determine the output that corresponds to zero angular velocity. Ring laser interferometers are self-calibrating. The beat frequency will be zero if and only if the ring laser setup is non-rotating with respect to inertial space. Fig. 8 illustrates the physical property that makes the ring laser interferometer self-calibrating. The grey dots represent molecules in the laser cavity that act as resonators. Along every section of the ring cavity, the speed of light is the same in both directions. When the ring laser device is rotating, then it rotates with respect to that background. In other words: invariance of the speed of light provides the reference for the self- calibrating property of the ring laser interferometer.  Lock-in  Ring laser gyroscopes suffer from an effect known as \\"lock-in\\" at low rotation rates (less than 100¬∞/h). At very low rotation rates, the frequencies of the counter-propagating laser modes become almost identical. In this case, crosstalk between the counter-propagating beams can result in injection locking, so that the standing wave \\"gets stuck\\" in a preferred phase, locking the frequency of each beam to each other rather than responding to gradual rotation. By rotationally dithering the laser cavity back and forth through a small angle at a rapid rate (hundreds of hertz), lock-in will only occur during the brief instances where the rotational velocity is close to zero; the errors thereby induced approximately cancel each other between alternating dead periods.  Fibre optic gyroscopes versus ring laser gyroscopes  Fibre optic gyros (FOGs) and ring laser gyros (RLGs) both operate by monitoring the difference in propagation time between beams of light traveling in clockwise and counterclockwise directions about a closed optical path. They differ considerably in various cost, reliability, size, weight, power, and other performance characteristics that need to be considered when evaluating these distinct technologies for a particular application. RLGs require accurate machining, use of precision mirrors, and assembly under clean room conditions. Their mechanical dithering assemblies add somewhat to their weight but not appreciably. RLGs are capable of logging in excess of 100,000 hours of operation in near-room temperature conditions. Their lasers have relatively high power requirements. Interferometric FOGs are purely solid-state, require no mechanical dithering components, do not require precision machining, have a flexible geometry, and can be made very small. They use many standard components from the telecom industry. In addition, the major optical components of FOGs have proven performance in the telecom industry, with lifespans measured in decades. However, the assembly of multiple optical components into a precision gyro instrument is costly. Analog FOGs offer the lowest possible cost but are limited in performance; digital FOGs offer the wide dynamic ranges and accurate scale factor corrections required for stringent applications. Use of longer and larger coils increases sensitivity at the cost of greater sensitivity to temperature variations and vibrations. =Zero-area Sagnac interferometer and gravitational wave detection= The Sagnac topology was actually first described by Michelson in 1886, who employed an even-reflection variant of this interferometer in a repetition of the Fizeau experiment. Michelson noted the extreme stability of the fringes produced by this form of interferometer: White-light fringes were observed immediately upon alignment of the mirrors. In dual-path interferometers, white-light fringes are difficult to obtain since the two path lengths must be matched to within a couple of micrometers (the coherence length of the white light). However, being a common-path interferometer, the Sagnac configuration inherently matches the two path lengths. Likewise Michelson observed that the fringe pattern would remain stable even while holding a lighted match below the optical path; in most interferometers the fringes would shift wildly due to the refractive index fluctuations from the warm air above the match. Sagnac interferometers are almost completely insensitive to displacements of the mirrors or beam-splitter. This characteristic of the Sagnac topology has led to their use in applications requiring exceptionally high stability. Figure 9. Zero-area Sagnac interferometer The fringe shift in a Sagnac interferometer due to rotation has a magnitude proportional to the enclosed area of the light path, and this area must be specified in relation to the axis of rotation. Thus the sign of the area of a loop is reversed when the loop is wound in the opposite direction (clockwise or anti-clockwise). A light path that includes loops in both directions, therefore, has a net area given by the difference between the areas of the clockwise and anti-clockwise loops. The special case of two equal but opposite loops is called a zero-area Sagnac interferometer. The result is an interferometer that exhibits the stability of the Sagnac topology while being insensitive to rotation. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) consisted of two 4-km Michelson‚ÄìFabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometers, and operated at a power level of about 100 watts of laser power at the beam splitter. After an upgrade to Advanced LIGO several kilowatts of laser power are required. A variety of competing optical systems are being explored for third generation enhancements beyond Advanced LIGO. One of these competing proposals is based on the zero-area Sagnac design. With a light path consisting of two loops of the same area, but in opposite directions, an effective area of zero is obtained thus canceling the Sagnac effect in its usual sense. Although insensitive to low frequency mirror drift, laser frequency variation, reflectivity imbalance between the arms, and thermally induced birefringence, this configuration is nevertheless sensitive to passing gravitational waves at frequencies of astronomical interest. However, many considerations are involved in the choice of an optical system, and despite the zero-area Sagnac's superiority in certain areas, there is as yet no consensus choice of optical system for third generation LIGO.

Constitution in Exile is a controversial term that refers to the situation resulting from provisions of the United States Constitution allegedly not having been enforced according to their \\"original intent\\" or \\"original meaning\\". Some originalists might argue, for example, that the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause do not authorize economic legislation dating all the way back to the New Deal. Origins and meaning According to an article by Legal Affairs Editor Jeffrey Rosen in The New Republic, \\"The phrase comes from a 1995 article by Douglas Ginsburg, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C., whom Ronald Reagan unsuccessfully nominated to the Supreme Court after the Senate rejected Bork.\\" According to the same article, reinstating provisions \\"exiled\\" from the Constitution would mean \\"reimposing meaningful limits on federal power that could strike at the core of the regulatory state for the first time since the New Deal. These justices could change the shape of laws governing the environment, workplace health and safety, anti-discrimination, and civil rights, making it difficult for the federal government\\" to act on these issues. Rosen considers this to be a form of judicial activism, though its proponents would argue that it was merely reversing decades of accumulated activism. =Rosen's argument= Rosen argues that one of the most important provisions of the Constitution in Exile is limitations on the interstate commerce clause, which were undermined by the Supreme Court's \\"expansive interpretation of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce... extended to include any activities that might affect commerce indirectly\\" during the New Deal. \\"In 1995, however, the Supreme Court began taking tentative steps toward resurrecting some of the constitutional limitations on the regulatory state that had been dormant since the 1930s. In controversial 5-4 rulings (primarily, United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison), the Court limited Congress's power to ban guns in the area surrounding schools, for example, and to punish violence against women, holding that the laws did not involve commercial activities and therefore couldn't be justified by Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce.\\" (A later decision in Gonzales v. Raich, in which Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy - integral parts of the Lopez and Morrison majorities - joined, seemed to show the limits of the court's willingness to curtail commerce clause power.) Most judges who are identified with the Constitution in Exile call themselves strict constructionists or originalists.

Kerr writes: \\"there is no evidence that a conservative has used the phrase 'Constitution in Exile' outside of a single reference in a 1995 book review.\\"Kerr, Orin (2005-01-03) Cass Sunstein Responds to \\"Constitution in Exile\\" Post, Volokh Conspiracy Bernstein writes that Sunstein and Rosen have invented a nonexistent cabal as a straw man:Bernstein David (2005-04-16) Rosen on the \\"Constitution in Exile\\", Volokh Conspiracy > I, as someone who knows probably just about every libertarian and most > Federalist Society law professors in the United States (there aren't that > many of us), and who teaches on the most libertarian law faculty in the > nation, never heard the phrase [...] [T]he phrase \\"Constitution in Exile > movement\\" implies that there is some organized group that has a specific > platform.

He was part of the White House press corps in the decades before the Second World War. Education and Career Born in Washburn, Tennessee., north of Knoxville, on August 22, 1881, Essary was the son of attorney John Thurman Essary and Maetta Hill Essary. He graduated from Nashville's Montgomery Bell Academy in 1899, attended Emory and Henry College, and entered the newspaper trade in 1903 with the Norfolk Ledger in Virginia. With a knack for being in the right place at the right time, Essary was one of just two reporters on hand at Kitty Hawk in April 1908 as the Wright brothers made their first public flights, disproving skeptics who had called them ‚Äúbetter liars than flyers.‚Äù. Essary moved on to become Washington correspondent for a series of papers before 1912 settling in at the Baltimore Sun, where he remained for the rest of his 39-year career. Essary went to Versailles with President Wilson for peace negotiations in 1919. He was president of the Gridiron Club. In late 1925, he moved to the Sun's London bureau for a year. He was the author of Covering Washington (1927) -- surprisingly familiar accounts of spin and manipulation. The Post reported that \\"President [Franklin] Roosevelt came to know Essary so well that he could recognize his deep baritone at crowded White House press conferences and would call him by name even when he could not see him.\\". Retirement and Death He retired as bureau chief in late 1941, remaining as a correspondent. J. Fred Essary died in his Washington office on March 11, 1942, aged 60. On his death, President Roosevelt sent personal condolences to the widow, while Secretary of State Cordell Hull, a Tennessean, wrote to her that ‚ÄúFred and I were close personal friends for 35 years.‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley paid tribute to him on the Senate floor. Colleague H.L. Mencken was among the active pallbearers. The Washington Post editorialized: \\"It was not even because his career as Washington correspondent extended over nine administrations that he was called 'the Dean' by his colleagues.... The term was primarily one of affection and respect pinned onto him by younger men who looked up to him as a friend and guide and an exemplar of what a Washington correspondent ought to be.\\" ReferencesSources \\"Newspaper Man to Make Change.\\" Washington Post, March 3, 1912. \\"Newspaper Men Sent 'Leak' Wires.\\" (Essary's role in insider trading scandal) New York Times, Feb. 4, 1917 \\"'Covering Washington' Relates Story of Work of Correspondent Here.\\" Washington Post, June 26, 1927. \\"J.

It has been designed and developed mainly by Framatome (part of Areva between 2001 and 2017) and √âlectricit√© de France (EDF) in France, and Siemens in Germany. In Europe this reactor design was called European Pressurised Reactor, and the internationalised name was Evolutionary Power Reactor, but it is now simply named EPR. The first operational EPR unit was China's Taishan 1, which started commercial operation in December 2018. Taishan 2 started commercial operation in September 2019. The first two EPR units to start construction, at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France, are both facing costly delays (to 2022 and 2023, respectively). Two units at Hinkley Point in the United Kingdom received final approval in September 2016 and are expected to be completed around 2026. EDF has acknowledged severe difficulties in building the EPR design. In September 2015 EDF stated that the design of a \\"New Model\\" EPR was being worked on, which will be easier and cheaper to build. DesignFirst EPR design= The main design objectives of the third generation EPR design are increased safety while providing enhanced economic competitiveness through improvements to previous pressurised water reactor designs scaled up to an electrical power output of around 1650 MWe (net) with thermal power of 4500 MW. The reactor can use 5% enriched uranium oxide fuel, reprocessed uranium fuel or 100% mixed uranium plutonium oxide fuel. The EPR is the evolutionary descendant of the Framatome N4 and Siemens Power Generation Division \\"Konvoi\\" reactors. Siemens ceased its nuclear activities in 2011. The EPR was designed to use uranium more efficiently than older Generation II reactors, using approximately 17% less uranium per unit of electricity generated than these older reactor technologies. The design had gone through a number of iterations. The 1994 conceptual design had a power output of 1450 MWe, the same as the Framatome N4, but using Siemens Konvoi derived instrumentation and including a new core catcher safety system. In 1995 there was concern over excessive cost per MW, and output was increased to 1800 MWe in the 2007 design, though this was subsequently reduced to 1650 MWe in the final certified design. The EPR design has several active and passive protection measures against accidents: *Four independent emergency cooling systems, each providing the required cooling of the decay heat that continues for 1 to 3 years after the reactor's initial shutdown (i.e., 300% redundancy) *Leaktight containment around the reactor *An extra container and cooling area if a molten core manages to escape the reactor (see containment building and core catcher) *Two-layer concrete wall with total thickness 2.6 m, designed to withstand impact by aeroplanes and internal overpressure The EPR has a design maximum core damage frequency of 6.1 √ó 10‚àí7 per station per year.EPR Level 1 Probabilistic Safety Assessment. Author: UK EPR. The EPR has a single steam turbine capable of using all the steam generated. =\\"New Model\\" EPR design= EDF acknowledged the difficulties it was having building the EPR design, with its head of production and engineering, Herv√© Machenaud, saying EDF had lost its dominant international position in design and construction of nuclear power stations. Machenaud indicated EDF was considering designing two new lower powered reactors, one with output of 1,500 MWe and the other 1,000 MWe. Machenaud stated there would be a period of reflection on the best way to improve the EPR design to lower its price and incorporate post-Fukushima safety improvements. In September 2015 EDF's chief executive Jean-Bernard L√©vy stated that the design of a \\"New Model\\" EPR, or \\"EPR 2\\", was being worked on, which will be easier to build, to be ready for orders from about 2020, describing it in 2016 as \\"a reactor offering the same characteristics as today‚Äôs EPR but it will be cheaper to build with optimised construction times and costs\\". In 2016 EDF planned to build two New Model EPR reactors in France by 2030 to prepare for renewing its fleet of older reactors. However following financial difficulties at Areva, and its merger with EDF, French Ecology Minister Nicolas Hulot said in January 2018 \\"for now [building a New Model EPR] is neither a priority or a plan. Right now the priority is to develop renewable energy and to reduce the share of nuclear.\\" The industry-government plan for 2019‚Äì2022 included work on \\"a new version of the EPR\\". In July 2019 the French nuclear safety authority ASN issued an opinion on the safety of an outline EPR New Model (EPR 2) design. It found that general safety was on the whole satisfactory, though identifying areas for further examination. The most notable simplification is a single layer containment building as opposed to the EPR‚Äôs double layer. ASN highlighted that the EPR design basis assumption that primary and secondary cooling circuit piping could not fail may no longer be appropriate for the simplified EPR 2, and requires additional safety demonstrations. In 2020 Energy Minister √âlisabeth Borne announced the government would not decide on the construction of any new reactors until the much delayed Flamanville 3 started operation after 2022. EDF had estimated building six EPR 2 nuclear reactors would cost at least ‚Ç¨46 billion. A Court of Audit report concluded that EDF is no longer able to finance EPR 2 construction on its own, so financing and profitability issues need to be resolved. The audit office requires that EDF must ensure financing and profitability of EPR 2 before constructing any in France. Olkiluoto 3 (Finland) Olkiluoto-3 under construction in 2009. It is scheduled to start regular electricity generation in 2022, a delay of thirteen years. The construction of the Olkiluoto 3 power station in Finland commenced in August 2005. The station will have an electrical power output of 1600 MWe (net). The construction was a joint effort of French Areva and German Siemens AG through their common subsidiary Areva NP, for Finnish operator TVO. Siemens ceased nuclear activities in 2011. Initial cost estimates were about ‚Ç¨3.7 billion, but the project has since seen several severe cost increments and delays, with latest cost estimates (from 2012) of more than ‚Ç¨8 billion. The station was initially scheduled to go online in 2009, but operations are now expected to start in 2022. In May 2006, construction delays of about one year were announced, following quality control problems across the construction. In part the delays were due to the lack of oversight of subcontractors inexperienced in nuclear construction. The delays led to disappointing financial results for the Areva NP. It blamed delays on the Finnish approach to approving technical documentation and designs. In December 2006, TVO announced construction was about 18 months behind schedule so completion was now expected 2010‚Äì11, and there were reports that Areva was preparing to take a ‚Ç¨500 million charge on its accounts for the delay. At the end of June 2007, it was reported that S√§teilyturvakeskus (STUK), the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, had found a number of safety-related design and manufacturing 'deficiencies'. In August 2007, a further construction delay of up to a year was reported associated with construction problems in reinforcing the reactor building to withstand an aeroplane crash, and the timely supply of adequate documentation to the Finnish authorities. In September 2007, TVO reported the construction delay as \\"at least two years\\" and costs more than 25% over budget. Cost estimates by analysts for the overrun range up to ‚Ç¨1.5 billion.Areva-Siemens sees Olkiluoto 3 reactor operational in summer 2011, CNN, 31 December 2007. A further delay was announced in October 2008, making the total delay three years, giving an expected online date of 2012. The parties are in arbitration to resolve a dispute over responsibility for the delays and final cost overruns. , the station was at least three and a half years behind schedule and more than 50 percent over-budget. Areva and the utility involved \\"are in bitter dispute over who will bear the cost overruns and there is a real risk now that the utility will default\\". In August 2009, Areva announced ‚Ç¨550 million additional provisions for the build, taking station costs to ‚Ç¨5.3 billion, and wiped out interim operating profits for the first half-year of 2009. The dome of the containment structure was topped out in September 2009. 90% of procurement, 80% of engineering works and 73% of civil works were completed. In June 2010, Areva announced ‚Ç¨400 million of further provisions, taking the cost overrun to ‚Ç¨2.7 billion. The timescale slipped from June 2012 to the end of 2012. In December 2011, TVO announced a further delay to August 2014. As of July 2012, the station was scheduled to start electricity production no earlier than 2015, a schedule slippage of at least six years. In December 2012 Areva's Chief Executive estimated costs to ‚Ç¨8 billion. In September 2014 Areva announced that operations would start in 2018. In October 2017 the date was pushed back to the spring of 2019. During testing in 2018 and 2019 multiple further delays were announced, of almost two years in total. In August 2020 the commissioning schedule was revised again: regular electricity generation is due to start in February 2022. Flamanville 3 (France) EDF has said its Flamanville 3 project (seen here in 2010) will be delayed until 2023. First concrete was poured for the demonstration EPR reactor at the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant on 6 December 2007.Nuclear Engineering International. Flamanville 3 concrete poured As the name implies, this will be the third nuclear reactor on the Flamanville site, and the second instance of an EPR being built. Electrical output will be 1630 MWe (net). The project was planned to involve around ‚Ç¨3.3 billion of capital expenditure from EDF, but latest cost estimates (from 2019) are at ‚Ç¨12.4 billion. Pierre Moscovici, president of the Court of Audit, gave a statement on 9 July 2020 concerning the release of the report on the delay costs of the Flamanville 3. The report of the Court of Audit reveals that the cost of Flamanville 3 could reach ‚Ç¨19.1 billion when taking in account the additional charges due to the delay in construction. From 19 October 2005 to 18 February 2006, the project was submitted to a national public debate. On 4 May 2006, the decision was made by EDF's Board of Directors to continue with the construction. Between 15 June and 31 July 2006, the unit underwent a public enquiry, which rendered a \\"favourable opinion\\" on the project. That summer, site preparation works began. In December 2007 construction of the unit itself began. This was expected to last 54 months, with commissioning planned for 2012. In April 2008, the French nuclear safety authority (Autorit√© de s√ªret√© nucl√©aire, ASN) reported that a quarter of the welds inspected in the secondary containment steel liner are not in accordance with norms, and that cracks have been found in the concrete base. EDF stated that progress was being made on these issues, which were raised very early in construction; however, on 21 May, ASN ordered a suspension of concrete pouring on the site. A month later, concreting work resumed after ASN accepted EDF's corrective action plan, which included external oversight checks. In May 2009, professor Stephen Thomas reported that after 18 months of construction, and after a series of quality control problems, the project is \\"more than 20 percent over budget and EDF is struggling to keep it on schedule\\". In August 2010, the regulator, ASN, reported further welding problems on the secondary containment steel liner. The same month, EDF announced that costs had increased 50% to ‚Ç¨5 billion, and commissioning was delayed by about two years to 2014. In July 2011, EDF announced that the estimated costs had escalated to ‚Ç¨6 billion, and that completion of construction was delayed to 2016. On 3 December 2012, EDF announced that the estimated costs had escalated to ‚Ç¨8.5 billion. In December 2012, the Italian power company Enel announced it was relinquishing its 12.5% stake in the project, and five future EPRs, so would be reimbursed its project stake of ‚Ç¨613 million, plus interest. In November 2014, EDF announced that completion of construction was delayed to 2017, due to delays in component delivery by Areva. In April 2015, Areva informed the French nuclear regulator ASN that anomalies had been detected in the reactor vessel steel, causing \\"lower than expected mechanical toughness values\\". Further tests are underway. In July 2015 The Daily Telegraph reported that Areva had been aware of this problem since 2006. In June 2015, multiple faults in cooling system safety valves were discovered by ASN. In September 2015, EDF announced that the estimated costs had escalated to ‚Ç¨10.5 billion, and the start-up of the reactor was delayed to the fourth quarter of 2018. In April 2016, ASN announced that additional weak spots had been found in the reactor steel, and Areva and EDF responded that new tests would be conducted, though construction work would continue. In February 2017, the Financial Times stated the project was six years late, and ‚Ç¨7.2 billion over budget, while renewed delays in the construction of the EPR-reactors at Taishan Nuclear Power Plant prompted EDF to state that Flamanville 3 remains on schedule to start operations by the end of 2018, assuming it receives regulatory approval. In June 2017, the French regulator issued a provisional ruling that Flamanville 3 is safe to start. The discovery of quality deviations in the welding led to a further revision of the schedule in July 2018. Fuel loading was delayed until the end of 2019, and the cost estimate was increased from ‚Ç¨10.5 billion to ‚Ç¨10.9 billion. In June 2019 the regulator ASN determined that eight welds in steam transfer pipes passing through the two wall containment, that EDF had hoped to repair after startup, must be repaired before the reactor is commissioned. In October 2019 EDF announced that because of this issue costs would increase to ‚Ç¨12.4 billion and that fuel loading would be delayed until the end of 2022 (with regular electricity generation starting in 2023 at the earliest). Taishan 1 and 2 (China) In 2006, Areva took part in the first bidding process for the construction of four new nuclear reactors in China, together with Toshiba- owned Westinghouse and Russian Atomstroyexport. However Areva lost this bid in favour of Westinghouse's AP1000 reactors, in part because of Areva's refusal to transfer the expertise and knowledge to China. Subsequently Areva managed to win a deal in February 2007, worth about ‚Ç¨8 billion ($10.5 billion) for two EPRs located in Taishan, Guangdong Province in southern China, in spite of sticking to its previous conditions. The General Contractor and Operator is the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN). The construction of the first reactor at Taishan started officially on 18 November 2009, and the second on 15 April 2010. Construction of each unit was then planned to take 46 months, significantly faster and cheaper than the first two EPRs in Finland and France. The reactor pressure vessel of the first reactor was installed in June 2012, and the second in November 2014. The first pressure vessel had been imported from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan, and steam generators from Areva in France. The second pressure vessel and associated steam generators had been made in China, by Dongfang Electric and Shanghai Electric. In 2014 construction was reported to be running over two years late, mainly due to key component delays and project management issues. Cold function tests were performed on Taishan 1 in February 2016, with start up expected in the first half of 2017. Taishan 2 was scheduled to start up later that year. However, commissioning dates were put back six months in February 2017, with commercial operation expected in the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018. In December 2017, Hong Kong media reported that a component had cracked during testing, needing to be replaced. In January 2018 commissioning was rescheduled again, with commercial operation expected in 2018 and 2019. In June 2018, Taishan 1 achieved criticality for the first time. It entered commercial operation in December 2018. Taishan 2 reached these milestones in May 2019 and September 2019, respectively. The Taishan project is led by Taishan Nuclear Power Joint Venture Co. (TNPJVC), a joint venture founded by CGN (51% ownership stake), EDF (30%), and Chinese utility Guangdong Energy Group (19%), also known as Yuedian. Companies involved in supplying equipment to Taishan Unit 1 include Framatome, which manufactured the steam generators and pressurizer in France, and China‚Äôs Dongfang Electric Corp. (DEC), which manufactured the Arabelle turbine in the engine room. That turbine was designed and licensed by General Electric. Other equipment suppliers for Unit 1 include Mitsubishi (reactor vessel); SKODA, a Czech company (core internals); and France‚Äôs Jeumont Electric, which along with DEC provided primary pumps. On 14 April 2020, Framatome signed a long-term service contract with the Taishan Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company Limited (TNPJVC) to support operations of two EPRs at the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in China. This contract covers nuclear plant outage and maintenance work, including spare parts supply and engineering services for eight years. Hinkley Point C (United Kingdom) The EPR underwent Generic Design Assessment by the Office for Nuclear Regulation, along with the Westinghouse AP1000. Interim Design Acceptance Confirmations were postponed until lessons from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster had been taken into account. EDF bought British Energy in 2009. EDF planned to build 4 new EPRs, subject to electricity pricing agreement with the government. Areva has signed a strategic partnership with Rolls-Royce to support the build of EPRs. On 19 March 2013 planning consent for Hinkley Point C nuclear power station was given, but difficult negotiations with the UK government about electricity pricing, and project financing with private investors, still needed to be concluded. On 21 October 2013, EDF Energy announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the nuclear stations to be built on the site of Hinkley Point C. EDF Group and the UK Government agreed on the key commercial terms of the investment contract. The final investment decision was conditional on completion of the remaining key steps, including the agreement of the European Commission. On 8 October 2014 the European Commission announced their agreement, with 16 out of 28 commissioners agreeing with the go ahead of the construction. On 21 September 2015 the British government announced it would provide a ¬£2 billion support package for Hinkley Point C as Britain's first nuclear power station in 20 years. On 21 October 2015, during Chinese president Xi Jinping's state visit to the United Kingdom, EDF and CGN signed an investment agreement for the ¬£18 billion (‚Ç¨20 billion) project to build two reactors at Hinkley Point. However, legally binding contracts had not been agreed yet. In June 2016, EDF managers told Members of Parliament that the Hinkley Point C proposal should be postponed, until it has \\"solved a litany of problems\\", including EDFs \\"soaring debts\\".Terry Macalister, \\"Hinkley Point should be postponed\\", The Guardian, 18 June 2016. On 28 July 2016, after the resignation of a board member, the EDF board approved the project. However Greg Clark, the new Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in the new government of Theresa May, then announced that the government would not sign the contract over the next few days as expected, but delay the contract to autumn to \\"consider carefully all the component parts of this project\\". Final government approval was given in September 2016. In July 2017, following an internal review, EDF announced revised estimates for the scheme, which included at least ¬£1.5 billion of additional costs and up to 15 months of additional programme, leading to updated total cost estimates of ¬£19.6-20.3 billion (‚Ç¨21.9-22.6 billion). In September 2019 cost estimates were revised again, to between ¬£21.5 and ¬£22.5 billion (‚Ç¨24-25.1 billion). Possible future power stationsFrance= In July 2008 the French President announced a second EPR would be built in France due to high oil and gas prices. Penly was chosen as the site in 2009, with construction planned to start in 2012. However, in 2011, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, EDF postponed public consultations. In February 2013, the Minister of Industrial Renewal Arnaud Montebourg stated that the plans for a new EPR reactor at Penly had been cancelled, citing the capacity for electricity production and massive investments in renewable energy along with his confidence in the EPR as a competitive project in foreign countries. Plans to build new reactors in France were later revived. In 2019, EDF plans to select a site for the installation of a pair of EPR reactors. Penly and Gravelines are among the candidates. In October 2019, newspaper Le Monde reported that the French government had sent EDF a \\"mission letter\\" in which it asked the company to prepare to build a total of six EPR reactors across three sites in the next 15 years. =India= In February 2009, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) signed a memorandum of understanding with Areva to set up two 1650 MWe reactors at Jaitapur in Maharashtra. This was followed by a framework agreement in December 2010.India, France ink pact for Areva reactors, fuel npcil.nic.in In January 2016, during French president Fran√ßois Hollande's state visit to India a joint statement with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was issued. According to the statement the two leaders \\"have agreed on a roadmap of cooperation to speed up discussions on the Jaitapur project in 2016. Their shared aim is to start the implementation of the project in early 2017.\\" On 10 March 2018 an Industrial Way Forward Agreement between EDF and NPCIL was signed, with an objective of producing a tender later in the year. NPCIL has ambitions to build up to 9900 MW at the Jaitapur site, equating to six EPRs. =United Kingdom= Two EPR units at Sizewell, Suffolk are in the early stages of planning. In May 2020, EDF Energy applied for a development consent order. If the project goes ahead electricity production is expected to start in 2031 at the earliest. Two further EPR units have been proposed for construction at the Moorside site near Sellafield, Cumbria, as part of a future clean energy hub that would also incorporate modular reactors, renewable energy generation, hydrogen production and battery storage technologies. Unsuccessful proposalsCanada= EPR was considered for the two (possible expansion to four) reactor addition to the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station in Ontario, Canada. However, the official bids had to include all contingencies, and Areva failed to enter a final bid meeting these requirements. The project was ultimately abandoned when the only bid, made by Canada's AECL, came in at well over $10/Wp. EPR was briefly considered for an installation in New Brunswick, replacing or supplanting that province's single CANDU 6. These plans lasted only from June 2010 until an election two months later, when the plan immediately disappeared from further study. = Czech Republic = In October 2012 CEZ announced that Areva was eliminated from the tender for the construction of 2 reactors for Temelin nuclear plant. Areva failed to comply with legal requirements of the tender. In April 2014 CEZ cancelled a tender, because of low power prices and the government's refusal to support a minimum guaranteed energy price. =Finland= In 2010 the Finnish parliament decided to allow two new reactors. Both TVO and Fennovoima were considering the EPR. In December 2013 Fennovoima confirmed it had selected a Russian AES-2006 VVER pressurised water reactor in preference to the EPR. =Italy= On 24 February 2009, Italy and France agreed to study the feasibility of building 4 new nuclear power stations in Italy. Following this, on 3 August 2009, EDF and Enel established a joint venture, Sviluppo Nucleare Italia, to study the feasibility of building at least four EPRs. However, in the 2011 referendum, soon after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Italians voted to repeal the new regulations permitting nuclear power in Italy. Abrogation of laws is put in effect when at least 50%+1 electors make a valid vote and a majority of these voters are in favour of abrogation. In this referendum there was a 55% valid voter turnout and 94% voted to abrogate the new regulations. =United Arab Emirates= In March 2008, French president Nicolas Sarkozy reached an agreement with the UAE cabinet that \\"outlines a cooperation framework for the assessment and possible use of nuclear energy for peaceful ends\\". This agreement was not a contract for EPR construction by any of the French nuclear companies, Total S.A., Suez or Areva. In May 2009, US President Barack Obama signed a similar agreement with the UAE. Contracts for reactors were not given, nor was there any guarantee made that US companies would receive them. In December 2009 the United Arab Emirates declined both the American and French bids and awarded a contract for construction of four non-EPR stations (APR-1400) to a South Korean group including Korea Electric Power Corporation, Hyundai Engineering and Construction, Samsung and Doosan Heavy Industries. After losing this order, Areva considered whether it should reintroduce the marketing of a smaller and simpler second-generation reactor design alongside the EPR, for countries that are new to nuclear power. As of 2011 Areva and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries offer a smaller 1100 MWe ATMEA1 Generation III PWR. =United States= The US-EPR, the version of the EPR submitted to the U.S. regulator, is one of the competitors for the next generation of nuclear stations in the United States, along with the AP1000 and the ESBWR. In February 2015 Areva asked to suspend the Design Certification Application Review process at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). It had been under review there with expectation to submit an application for final design approval and standard design certification since 14 December 2007. UniStar, Amarillo Power, PPL Corp and AmerenUE announced plans to file a Combined Construction and Operating License application in 2008 for the US-EPR at its Callaway station. UniStar filed a partial application in July 2007 for a proposed third unit at the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Maryland. However, both proposals were subsequently cancelled. In April 2009, Missouri legislators balked at preconstruction rate increases, prompting AmerenUE to suspend plans for its reactor.Terry Ganey. AmerenUE pulls plug on project Columbia Daily Tribune, 23 April 2009. In July 2010, Constellation Energy Group cut spending on UniStar for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Station because of uncertainties for a loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy, and subsequently pulled out of the project. In October 2008, Areva announced that it will partner with US defense firm Northrop Grumman to establish a $380 million facility to construct modules and assemblies for the EPR and US-EPR reactors at Northrop Grumman's Newport News Shipyard in Virginia. The project was suspended indefinitely in May 2011.

The drug is also used off- label in the treatment of anxiety disorders and panic disorder. Medical uses Tiagabine is approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunctive treatment for partial seizures in individuals of age 12 and up. It may also be prescribed off-label by physicians to treat anxiety disorders and panic disorder as well as neuropathic pain (including fibromyalgia). For anxiety and neuropathic pain, tiagabine is used primarily to augment other treatments. Tiagabine may be used alongside selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or benzodiazepines for anxiety, or antidepressants, gabapentin, other anticonvulsants, or opioids for neuropathic pain.Stahl, S. Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Prescriber's Guide. Cambridge University Press: New York, NY. 2009. pp. 523-526 Side effects The most common side effect of tiagabine is dizziness. Other side effects that have been observed with a rate of statistical significance relative to placebo include asthenia, somnolence, nervousness, memory impairment, tremor, headache, diarrhea, and depression. Adverse effects such as confusion, aphasia (difficulty speaking clearly)/stuttering, and paresthesia (a tingling sensation in the body's extremities, particularly the hands and fingers) may occur at higher dosages of the drug (e.g., over 8 mg/day). Tiagabine may induce seizures in those without epilepsy, particularly if they are taking another drug which lowers the seizure threshold. There may be an increased risk of psychosis with tiagabine treatment, although data is mixed and inconclusive. Tiagabine can also reportedly interfere with visual color perception. Overdose Tiagabine overdose can produce neurological symptoms such as lethargy, single or multiple seizures, status epilepticus, coma, confusion, agitation, tremors, dizziness, dystonias/abnormal posturing, and hallucinations, as well as respiratory depression, tachycardia, hypertension, and hypotension. Overdose may be fatal especially if the victim presents with severe respiratory depression and/or unresponsiveness. Pharmacology Tiagabine increases the level of Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, by blocking the GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1), and hence is classified as a GABA reuptake inhibitor (GRI). History Tiagabine was discovered at Novo Nordisk in Denmark in 1988 by a team of medicinal chemists and pharmacologists under the general direction of Claus Br√¶strup. The drug was co-developed with Abbott Laboratories, in a 40/60 cost sharing deal, with Abbott paying a premium for licensing the IP from the Danish company. Abbott did initially embrace the drug enthusiastically after its U.S. launch in 1998, and provided further clinical studies with the goal of gaining FDA approval for monotherapy in epilepsy. However, the senior management at Abbott drew back after realizing that the original deal with Novo would limit the company's financial gain from a monotherapy approval. After a period of co-promotion, Cephalon licensed tiagabine from Abbott/Novo and now is the exclusive producer. U.S. patents on tiagabine listed in the Orange Book expired in April 2016.Orange Book index page.

Prince William and Prince Harry attended the pre-prep school in Notting Hill. The school is named after Wetherby Place, in turn named after a West Yorkshire town, Wetherby. It is not to be confused with Wetherby High School, the Yorkshire town's local secondary school. It is part of the Alpha Plus Education Group and is a member of the Independent Association of Preparatory Schools. History Wetherby School was founded in 1951 as a pre-preparatory school for boys aged 4‚Äì8. In 2004 it opened a preparatory department (known as Wetherby Prep, and intended to be a separate school) in a nearby building, allowing boys to stay on until the age of 13. The prep school has since moved to its current location in the City of Westminster. The pre-preparatory school had, as of 2017, 360 boys on its roll, including 88 in Reception. It has since opened a nursery section (\\"Little Wetherby\\") for boys aged 2¬Ω to 4. The school's original building, in 1951, was in Wetherby Place in south Kensington (hence the name, Wetherby School) but in 1971 it moved to its present building in Pembridge Square, on the other side of Kensington Gardens. The school building is a white stucco double fronted Victorian house in the Italianate style typical of Notting Hill and Holland Park architecture, constructed in about 1850. It is on the south side of Pembridge Square, a private garden square with keyholder-only access which the boys use as their playground. The school was in the middle of a public row with the working unions in March 2019 that was reported by the Financial Times in which leaflets were given to parents outside the school asking them to support the teachers following the school's decision to quit the Teachers' Pension Scheme. This was followed by another public row, this time with parents, during the Coronavirus crisis in April 2020 that was reported by both The Times and the Financial Times as the school initially insisted in a letter signed by the parent company's CEO, Mark Hanley-Browne, that fees would still be fully payable even if its physical sites were closed. This attitude was described by parents as \\"the kind of behaviour you‚Äôd expect from a distressed hedge fund\\". The school finally reversed course and wrote to parents announcing it would cut summer fees by 20 per cent. This fee reduction could affect the value of the school in the parent company's accounts as it is based on the fees that the private equity owner expects to obtain during the next ten years something that may explain its reluctance to cut fees contrary to other UK institutions that introduced fee cuts on their own initiative. Admissions Pupils are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis and operates, therefore, no entrance examination, test or interview. The result is that the school caters for boys of many different abilities and talents. The fees for the 2019-2020 academic year are ¬£7,710 per term and are increased each year in accordance to, among other factors, the ten year plan set by the Alpha Plus Group for the valuation of its assets. The fees are currently higher than in comparable schools such as Thomas's that charges ¬£7,143 in Kensington and ¬£6,429 in Battersea. However, because fees are charged (and, to a lesser extent, because of the smart neighbourhood in which it is located), the boys tend to come from a fairly narrow professional family background. It is also a single-sex school, although it is in the same ownership as Pembridge Hall, a similar school for girls which is also located in Pembridge Square. There are no formal joint activities between the two schools, but many children in each school have siblings at the other school. Uniform The boys wear a uniform of grey shorts, grey blazers with red trim, white shirts and plain red ties; and a grey peaked cap. The school logo \\"WS\\" in red is on the cap and on the breast pocket of the blazer. Preparatory school In 2004, Wetherby expanded to open a prep division for boys aged 7 to 13, sited in Bryanston Square, London. In September 2012, Wetherby Prep was awarded 'Prep School of the Year' at the annual Tatler School Awards at the Dorchester Hotel. The fees for the 2019-2020 academic year are ¬£7825 per term and are increased each year in accordance to, among other factors, the ten year plan set by the Alpha Plus Group for the valuation of its assets. Senior school Due to popular demand, the senior school for boys aged 11 to 18 opened for its first intake in September 2015. It is located at the former premises of DLD College London on Marylebone Lane, a ten-minute walk away from the prep school. The fees for the 2019-2020 academic year are ¬£8310 per term and are increased each year in accordance to, among other factors, the ten year plan set by the Alpha Plus Group for the valuation of its assets. The Senior school continued to generate losses during the 2018/19 academic year and the parent company does not expect that the situation will change until 2021 the earliest. Wetherby Kensington Wetherby Kensington is the most recent school to join the Wetherby family, with their doors opening in September 2017. Wetherby Kensington is situated on Wetherby Gardens in Kensington, which is the same street that the original Wetherby School was based back in 1951, and takes boys from Reception ‚Äì Year 3 (4-8 years old). Helen Milnes, former Deputy Head Pastoral at Wetherby School Notting Hill, is the current Headmistress. The school was widely featured in the press during 2017 when it was rumoured that Prince George would be joining although the Royal Family finally chose to have him attending Thomas's Battersea.

The diocese comprises the counties of Carson City, Churchill, Douglas, Elko, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Lyon, Mineral, Pershing, Storey and Washoe. The bishop of Reno has his liturgical and canonical seat (cathedra) at The Cathedral of Saint Thomas Aquinas. The See of Reno is a suffragan diocese of the Ecclesiastical Province of San Francisco. Other suffragan sees include the Dioceses of Honolulu, Las Vegas, Oakland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Jose, Santa Rosa and Stockton. History With the urging of Cardinal George Mundelein, Archbishop of Chicago, Pope Pius XI established the Diocese on March 27, 1931. It was renamed as the Diocese of Reno-Las Vegas by Pope Paul VI, October 13, 1976. On March 21, 1995 Pope John Paul II changed it back to the Diocese of Reno while splitting Las Vegas, Nevada into a new diocese. Phillip Francis Straling officially retired on June 21, 2005, but continued to serve as apostolic administrator of the diocese. On December 23, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Randolph Roque Calvo, of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, as the seventh Bishop of Reno.

Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that federal courts did not have the judicial power to create general federal common law when hearing state law claims under diversity jurisdiction. In reaching this holding, the Court overturned almost a century of federal civil procedure case law, and established the foundation of what remains the modern law of diversity jurisdiction as it applies to United States federal courts. Facts Erie began as a simple personal injury case when the plaintiff filed his complaint in diversity in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. As explained by the Second Circuit in its decision below, Harry Tompkins, a citizen and resident of Pennsylvania, was walking next to the Erie Railroad's Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad tracks in Hughestown, Pennsylvania, at 2:30 a.m. on July 27, 1934. A friend of Tompkins had driven him to within a few blocks of his home, which was located on a dead-end street near the tracks. Tompkins chose to walk the remaining distance on a narrow but well-worn footpath adjacent to the tracks. A train approached in the darkness, and an object protruding from one of the cars struck Tompkins. When he fell to the ground, his right arm was crushed beneath the wheels of the train. The train was owned and operated by the Erie Railroad company, a New York corporation. Tompkins sued this railroad company in a federal district court‚Äîthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court, following the federal law at that time, applied neither New York nor Pennsylvania common law, but instead applied federal common law, which applied an 'ordinary negligence' standard in determining the duty of care owed to persons not employed by the railroad or otherwise acting in the course of their employment walking along railroad tracks. In applying the federal common law standard, the federal court declined to apply Pennsylvania's common law standard of 'wanton negligence' for the duty of care owed by railroads to trespassers. The case was decided by a jury which was instructed by Judge Samuel Mandelbaum in accordance with the federal negligence standard. It found in favor of Tompkins and awarded him damages. The railroad appealed to the Second Circuit, which affirmed, then petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari, which was granted; Justice Benjamin Cardozo granted the railroad a stay of its obligation to pay the judgment in Tompkins' favor until the Court decided the case. By the time the Supreme Court's decision in Erie was handed down, it had long been settled that when a federal court hears a state cause of action brought in federal district court in diversity, the statutory law of the state would be applied. However, in the case of Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. 1 (1842), the Supreme Court had held that the federal courts need not also apply the court-made common law of the states. This had led to forum shopping, a litigation tactic whereby plaintiffs would seek to sue in federal court instead of state court in order to have a different substantive law applied. In light of this inequity, the Supreme Court had to determine whether federal courts should apply state common law. However, the Court did not decide whether or not the new ruling applied to equity jurisprudence. Judgment The Court, in an opinion by Associate Justice Brandeis, examined the manipulations and opportunistic practices of litigants that had resulted from the rule of Swift v. Tyson and determined that \\"in attempting to promote uniformity of law throughout the United States, the doctrine had prevented uniformity in the administration of the law of the state.\\" This had the effect of denying litigants equal protection of the law. In Swift, Justice Joseph Story had sought to interpret the Rules of Decision Act. This Act, which began as Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, is now codified at and is as follows: :The laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. In the Swift decision, Story had interpreted the words \\"laws of the several States\\" narrowly, treating them as referring to only the statutory law of states and not the judge-made law declared by states' appellate courts. Thus, where the state legislature had not passed a statute that controlled the case, a federal district court was free to make up its own common law. This was enormously significant because nearly all U.S. contract and tort law consisted of (and still largely consists of) state judge-made law whose foundations lay in English common law running back to time immemorial. With Swift, Story gave federal courts the freedom to depart from the existing body of state law if they so desired. Story apparently hoped that when hearing state law claims in diversity jurisdiction, federal district courts would fashion a uniform \\"general law.\\" As interstate commerce continued to increase, the common law of the states would converge with such general federal common law because states would recognize it was in their own best interest. By 1938, as Justice Brandeis acknowledged, \\"the mischievous results of the doctrine had become apparent.\\" The problem with Swift was that rather than reducing forum shopping, it had only increased it by increasing the opportunities for forum shopping available to litigants. There were two underlying issues behind this. First, as the Erie opinion noted, nothing in the Constitution actually grants jurisdiction to the federal judiciary to conduct plenary review of issues of state common law where no federal issue is present. Second, in accordance with that understanding (although this latter point was not noted in the Erie opinion), Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 only authorized the Supreme Court to review those state supreme court decisions that rejected federal claims. While Congress broadened the scope of Supreme Court review in 1914 to include state supreme court decisions allowing federal claims, Congress never actually authorized the Supreme Court to conduct plenary review of the merits of state law claims (and no one ever sought a constitutional amendment that would authorize Congress to do that). This meant the Supreme Court could not directly dictate uniform rules of state common law to all state courts or reverse their decisions for failing to apply such rules, which stands in stark contrast to other common law federations like Australia and Canada whose highest courts do possess such powers. Since state courts had no actual obligation to follow the \\"general law\\" independently formulated under Swift by federal courts, state judge-made law continued to diverge instead of converge. In turn, allowing federal courts to make up their own independent judge-made law only made the problem worse. Parties who felt disadvantaged by a state judge-made rule could create diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts by simply moving to another state or reincorporating there (if a party was a corporation). In the worst cases a party who had lost in the state supreme court would simply begin all over again in federal courts; since the federal district court had its own set of common law rules, it could hold it was not bound by the state supreme court ruling. This practice was mentioned in dissent by Justice Holmes in Brown and Yellow Taxicab. The facts of Erie itself were an example of the kind of clever forum shopping practices which the Court wished to end. Pennsylvania clearly had personal jurisdiction over the railroad because of its operations there; also, the accident happened there, and Tompkins was a Pennsylvania resident. But Tompkins chose to sue in a New York federal court to take advantage of its favorable rule -- knowing that he had a much lower probability of obtaining a judgment in his favor under Pennsylvania's rule. Therefore, the Court felt it was time to overrule the doctrine of Swift as an unconstitutional extension of its own powers. Nothing in the Constitution of the United States permits the U.S. Congress to empower federal courts to create their own common law for cases that do not involve an issue of federal law. As Justice Brandeis wrote: :Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a state whether they be local in their nature or \\"general,\\" be they commercial law or a part of the law of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts. Thus, although the Erie decision itself does not identify specific provisions of the Constitution violated by Swift, the language of the decision implies that Swift had stolen powers reserved to the states, in violation of the Tenth Amendment. Justice Brandeis also noted problems for equal protection of the laws, but the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to states, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause was not read to include an equal protection component until the 1954 decision in Bolling v. Sharpe. As a result of Erie, each federal district court was required to apply the law of whichever state it was sitting in, as though it was a state court of that state. Of course, this was a very difficult decision for the Court, since overruling Swift meant that a huge number of decisions by the Court and all lower federal courts were no longer valid law. However, the Court did not declare the Rules of Decision Act itself unconstitutional. Instead, it reinterpreted the Act so federal district courts hearing cases in diversity jurisdiction had to apply the entire law, both statutory and judge-made, of the states in which they sit. =Reed's concurrence= Associate Justice Stanley Reed filed a concurrence in which he agreed Swift had to be reversed, but argued Swift was merely an erroneous interpretation of the Rules of Decision Act, not an unconstitutional one. =Butler's dissent= Associate Justice Pierce Butler filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Associate Justice James McReynolds, in which he argued the majority had engaged in judicial activism. He asserted the majority had completely rewritten the two questions presented in the petition for certiorari as a constitutional question, when there really was no constitutional issue. He pointed out that no one in this case had directly challenged the Swift regime, which the Court had adhered to for so long in so many cases. SignificanceOn remand= The case was remanded to the Second Circuit for a ruling on the merits of Pennsylvania law. Rather than applying New York law, the Court of Appeals applied the law of Pennsylvania as required by the choice-of-law rules of the time -- under which the law of the place of the accident was determinative -- and threw out Tompkins' case. =Subsequent jurisprudence= Later opinions limited the application of Erie to substantive state law; federal courts can generally use the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure while hearing state law claims. It can be a problem for federal courts to know what a state court would decide on an issue of first impression (i.e., one not previously considered by state courts). In such circumstances, federal courts engage in what is informally called an \\"Erie guess.\\" This \\"guess,\\" actually a carefully reasoned attempt to anticipate what the state's courts would decide, is not binding on state courts themselves, which may adopt the federal court's reasoning if and when the issue reaches them in some other case, or may decide the issue differently. In the latter case, future federal courts would be required to follow the state's precedents, although a final judgment in the \\"guessed\\" case would not be reopened. Alternatively, federal courts can certify questions to a state supreme court, so long as the state itself has a procedure in place to allow this. For example, some federal district (trial) courts can certify questions to state supreme courts, but other states allow only federal courts of appeal (circuit) courts to do so. In the latter situation, an Erie guess would be the only option available for the federal court attempting to apply state law. Erie Railroad is considered one of the major examples where the Supreme Court has exceptionally gone against the principle of party presentation, as neither party had suggested a need to review Swift but the Court took it up themselves to review and ultimately overturn it.

(which later became 3D Realms) in 1987. Starting with the Kroz series for MS- DOS from that year, Miller pioneered the concept of giving away the first game in a trilogy--distributed freely as shareware--with the opportunity to purchase the remaining two episodes. This method became the standard distribution method for Apogee. Competitors such as Epic MegaGames later adopted the same business model.  Biography  Growing up, Miller lived with his father, Boyd Miller, an engineer at NASA who worked on the Apollo and Gemini programs. Miller began writing video games in 1975 on a Wang 2200 while living in Australia. He wrote several MS-DOS games that circulated widely on BBS file bases: Computer Quiz, Astronomy Quiz, BASIC Quiz, Beyond the Titanic, Supernova, Kingdom of Kroz, Word Whiz, Trek Trivia. Miller started as game programmer, but now handled primary business duties of 3D Realms, as well as producing and co-designing all third-party games associated with the company, including Wolfenstein 3D, Raptor: Call of the Shadows, Terminal Velocity, Max Payne and Prey. He pioneered the shareware method of game distribution where one episode of a game is released freely through digital distribution, and the follow-up episodes are sold through the company. In effect, the free episode is the carrot-on-a-stick; an advertisement to purchase the remaining, commercial episodes. Kingdom of Kroz, in 1987, was the first game to use this method, which Miller refers to as the \\"Apogee Model.\\" Upon success with this model with the seven Kroz episodes, Miller left his full-time job in early 1990s and devoted full efforts into growing Apogee. It was at this time that Miller contacted key members at Softdisk (a monthly software magazine delivered on floppy disks to subscribers) who later formed id Software, and convinced them to make Commander Keen as a shareware game to be released through Apogee, which proved to be an outstanding success, and led id Software to become an independent studio. Miller was later instrumental in the formation of Gathering of Developers in 1998, a new publisher created with the aid of several leading game studios, and later sold to Take-Two Interactive. He later helped found the Radar Group. Miller was also a professional industry writer in the 1980s, having co-authored a book on video games, Shootout: Zap the Video Games, and writing a weekly column for The Dallas Morning News for four years (1982-1985), titled \\"Video Vision\\", and later changed to \\"Computer Fun\\". He has also written for COMPUTE!'s PC and PCjr and other now defunct national game industry magazines. From 2006-8, Miller maintained an industry blog, www.GameMatters.com, where his views show him to be a strong proponent of studio independence, and of studios and publishers creating original brands rather than licensing brands from other media sources. GameSpot once named him as number 14 in their listing of the Most Influential People in Computer Gaming of All Time. In 1997, Computer Gaming World ranked him as number 14 on the list of the Most Influential People of All Time in computer gaming for originating the shareware model.CGW 159: The Most Influential People in Computer Gaming ReferencesExternal links * * Game Matters, Miller's blog * Scott Miller's biography at 3D Realms * Scott Miller's biography at Radar Group Category:1961 births Category:American chief executives Category:American computer businesspeople Category:American video game designers Category:Living people Category:People from Florida Category:Video game programmers Category:The Dallas Morning News people ","title":"Scott Miller (entrepreneur)"},{"id":"1636438","text":"The MG Midget is a small two-seater sports car produced by MG from 1961 to 1979. It revived a name that had been used on earlier models such as the MG M-type, MG D-type, MG J-type and MG T-type. MG Midget MkI (1961‚Äì64) The first version, announced at the end of June 1961, was essentially a slightly more expensive badge-engineered version of the MkII Austin-Healey Sprite deluxe version. The original 'frogeye' Sprite had been introduced specifically to fill the gap in the market left by the end of production of the MG T-type Midget as its replacement, the MGA had been a significantly larger and more expensive car with greater performance. Many existing MG buyers turned to the Sprite to provide a modern low-cost sports car and so a badge-engineered MG version reusing the Midget name made sense. The new Midget differed from the Sprite only in grille design, badging, improved interior trim, better instruments and added external polished trim to justify its higher price. Horler, p 50 Mechanically the car was identical to its Austin-Healey counterpart, retaining the rear suspension using quarter-elliptic leaf springs and trailing arms from the 'frogeye'. The engine was a 948 cc A-Series with twin SU carburettors producing at 5500 rpm and at 3000 rpm. Brakes were drums all round. A hard top, heater, radio and luggage rack were available as factory-fitted extras. In October 1962, the engine was increased to 1098 cc, raising the output to at 5500 rpm and at 3250 rpm, and disc brakes replaced the drums at the front. 13x4\\" Wire spoked wheels became available. The doors had no external handles or locks and the windows were sliding Perspex side- screens. A heater was an optional extra. Production was 16,080 of the small- engined version and 9601 of the 1098. A car with the 948 cc engine was tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1962 and had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 18.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£689 including taxes on the UK market. MG Midget MkII (1964‚Äì66) Externally the main changes were to the doors, which gained wind- up windows, swivelling quarter lights (AKA wing windows), external handles, and separate locks. The windscreen gained a slight curvature and was retained in a more substantial frame. The hood (US ‚Äì top), though modified, continued to have a removable frame that had to be erected before the cover was put on. The rear springs were replaced by more conventional semi-elliptic types, which gave a better ride. The engine block was strengthened and larger main bearings were fitted, increasing the power to at 5750 rpm and torque to at 3500 rpm. A total of 26,601 were made. MG Midget MkIII (1966‚Äì74) Round wheel arch MG Midget on Autotest The engine grew to 1275 cc using the development seen on the Mini-Cooper 'S'. Enthusiasts were disappointed that this was a detuned version of the at 5800 rpm Cooper 'S' engine, giving only at 6000 rpm and at 3000 rpm. A reduced compression ratio of 8.8:1 was used instead of the 9.75:1 employed on the Cooper S engine. The Midget used the 12G940 cylinder head casting that was common to other BMC 1300 cars, whereas the Cooper 'S' had a special head with not only larger inlet, but also larger exhaust valves; however, these exhaust valves caused many 'S' heads to fail through cracking between the valve seats. The detuned engine was used for reasons of model range placement ‚Äì with the Cooper 'S' spec engine, the Midget could have been faster than the more expensive MGB. The hydraulic system gained a separate master cylinder for the clutch. The hood was now permanently attached to the car, with an improved mechanism making it much easier to use. In late 1967 (1968 model year), US-spec cars received several safety additions: a padded fascia (dashboard) with smaller main gauges, collapsible steering column, scissor-type hood hinges, a third windshield wiper, additional side marker lights, and anti-burst door latches. In Dec 1968, beginning s/n 66236, the rear axle gear ratio was reduced from 4.22:1 to 3.90:1, giving for every 1000 rpm. This increased final drive ratio gave better fuel economy. Original Sprite and Midget, Terry Horler, pg 107 Minor facelift changes were made to the body trim in late 1969 (1970 model year), with the sills painted black, a revised recessed black grille, and squared off taillights as on the MGB. The 13-inch Rubery Owen \\"Rostyle\\" wheels were standardized, but wire-spoked ones remained an option. Both fitted with either 520X13 Crossply tyres or 145HR13 Pirelli Cinturato CA67 These revised cars were initially presented with matt black-painted windscreen surrounds but this proved very unpopular and after only a few hundred had been built the Midget reverted to the original brushed alloy. In August 1971, the compression ratio on North American engines was reduced to 8.0:1. Engine power output fell to at 5500 rpm and at 3250 rpm. 1972 MG Midget The square-shaped rear wheel arches became rounded in January 1972. Also in this year, a Triumph steering rack was fitted, giving a gearing that was somewhat lower than earlier Midgets. A second exhaust silencer was also added in 1972. Alternators were fitted instead of dynamos (generators) from 1973 onwards. Seven months into the 1974 model year, oversized rubber bumper blocks, nicknamed \\"Sabrinas\\" after the well-endowed British actress, were added to the chrome bumpers to meet the first US bumper impact regulations. Many consider the round-arch Midgets with chrome bumpers produced for model years 1972-1974 to be the most desirable. These round-arch cars started leaving the Abingdon factory in late 1971. Between 1966 and the 1969 face lift, 22,415 were made, and a further 77,831 up to 1974. MG Midget 1500 (1974‚Äì80) 1976 MG Midget 1500 1979 MG Midget 1500 To meet US federal regulations, large black plastic bumpers were added to the front and rear and the ride heights were increased. The increased ride heights affected handling, and anti-roll bars were added to help with the higher centre of gravity. The A-Series engine was replaced by the 1493 cc Standard SC engine from the Triumph Spitfire, coupled to a modified Morris Marina gearbox with synchromesh on all four gears. The increased displacement of the new engine was better able to cope with the increasing emission regulations. Although the horsepower ratings were similar (65 bhp ‚Äì home market) the 1493 cc engine produced more torque. The increased output combined with taller gear ratios resulted in faster acceleration (12 seconds 0‚Äì60 compared to 13 for the 1275 cc version) and top speed of just over 100 mph. In the US market British Leyland struggled to keep engine power at acceptable levels, as the engines were loaded with air pumps, EGR valves and catalytic converters to keep up with new US and California exhaust emission control regulations. Home market cars had twin SU HS4 carbs The U.S market's dual SU HS2 carbs were swapped for a single Zenith- Stromberg 150 CD4 unit catalytic converter carb in 1976 and all models after came with the Zenith-Stromberg 150 CD4T 1500 workshop manual British Leyland UK limited and the power fell to 50 bhp at 5000 RPM and 67 lb-ft of torque at 2500 RPM. The round rear-wheel arches were now square again, to increase the body strength.Sports Car Market, October 2007. The last car was made on 7 December 1979, after 73,899 of the last version had been made. The last 500 home-market cars were painted black. ADO34 Mini-based MG Midget concept car that never made it to production. (Photo taken in 2003 at the Heritage Motor Centre in Gaydon) ADO34 was the name of a project active between 1960 and 1964 that aimed to possibly develop a front-wheel drive Mini-based roadster as a possible new MG Midget or Austin-Healey Sprite. Following the launch of the MG Midget in 1961, it was considered as a possible MG Midget or Austin Healey Sprite replacement. The project was cancelled in about 1964. In 1965 Peugeot released the 204 Cabriolet, also styled by Pininfarina and featuring strong visual similarities to the ADO34, especially at the near- identical rear. The 204's transverse engined, front-wheel drive configuration (a new approach for Peugeot) was also BMC-inspired. MG Midget racing coupes MG racing driver and garage owner Dick Jacobs persuaded Abingdon to build a pair of special lightweight Midgets with a GT body shape inspired by the Aston Martin DB4. The roof used the front part of the standard Midget hardtop, while the rear portion and the windshield were custom. A quick release fuel filler was placed beneath the rear windshield to the right. The nose was redesigned by Syd Enever to improve the aerodynamic efficiency‚Äîwind tunnel tests showed that the new body required 13 hp less to achieve 100 mph than the standard body shape. The cars were registered BJB 770 and BJB 771. A third car was constructed for John Milne of Scotland and all three cars survive. The two loaned to Dick Jacobs were originally fitted with 979 cc A-series engines with twin Webers and approximately . As campaigned from 1962 to 1963 they received 997 cc (Formula Junior-spec.) BMC A-series engines. For the 1964 season they ran the larger Formula Junior engine at 1139cc, with a 1287cc engine using a block derived from the Mini-Cooper 'S' available for events where the coupes ran as prototypes. They were fitted with 18.5 gallon fuel tanks, larger oil coolers, large-bore exhaust systems and dual-circuit brakes.Jacobs, Dick, An MG Experience, ¬© 1976 Transport Bookman Publications See also * Sprite Car Club of Australia (includes MG Midgets) ReferencesFurther reading  Category:1970s cars Midget Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Roadsters Category:Sports cars Category:Cars introduced in 1961 ","title":"MG Midget"},{"id":"1636439","text":"Flotel, a portmanteau of the terms floating hotel, is the installation of living quarters on top of rafts or semi-submersible platforms.

The Tees Barrage comprises a river barrage, road bridge, footbridge, barge lock, fish pass and white water course. The waters above the barrage are permanently held at the level of an average high tide and are used for watersports such as canoeing, jet skiing, dragonboat racing and incorporates a 1 km rowing course. The barrage is accessible by road only from Thornaby-on- Tees as there is very limited road access to the north bank of the Tees. The Tees Barrage and Tees Barrage International White Water Course are developments of the Teesside Development Corporation.  Design  The concrete base of the barrage is 70 m wide, 32 m long, and 5 m thick; it is supported by five concrete piers. In between the piers are four 8 m tall, 50 tonne fish belly plates to control the flow of water, operated by 21 tonne hydraulic rams. The 600 ton road bridge is of a tubular steel arched viaduct design specified at 45 units of HB motorway loading. The bridge has eight welded tubular steel arches each 17.5 m wide with a 5 m rise but only the four central arches actually cross the waters of the river Tees. The arches are sprayed with green chlorinated rubber paint and are sealed against corrosion. Some 16,500 cubic metres of reinforced concrete and 650 tons of structural steel went into the building of the barrage. On the downstream side of the central pier is a 29 m tower of lights with reflective globes and plates, supported by guy ropes. Illumination is provided by four lights on the concrete barrage base for ease of maintenance. The barrage has two pavilions, one on the south bank, and a little-used one on the north bank, both extending under the road bridge. The south bank pavilion houses the barrage control room and the offices of the SMi ‚Äì Stockton Middlesbrough Initiative'. A visitors' centre is also planned for the barrage. The barrage has a design life of 120 years. The project also included the regeneration of 100 ha of adjacent derelict land producing riverside walks, parkland and leisure facilities.  Construction  The Teesside Development Corporation proposed a barrage across the Tees in an act of Parliament and then organised a design competition for the barrage bridge that was won by Ove Arup and the Napper Partnership. The barrage was constructed by Tarmac Construction. Construction work was started on 4 November 1991. The construction method chosen by Tarmac was to divert the River Tees around the barrage site to allow the barrage to built \\"in the dry\\" and avoid the need for providing time consuming and expensive cofferdams and jetties in the existing river. To prevent uplift of the dry river bed, deep pressure relief wells were required which needed to be fully functional until the barrage was built and the site flooded. The wells were installed and maintained by WJ Groundwater Limited under a subcontract with Tarmac.  Operation  Boundary stone marking the limits of the Tees Barrage and the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority The barrage was opened on 22 April 1995 with an international competition on the white water course, and inaugurated on 17 July the same year by the Duke of Edinburgh. In April 2001 ownership of the Tees Barrage and white water course was passed to British Waterways (now the Canal & River Trust) from its original owners English Partnerships. The Canal & River Trust are also responsible for managing the 11 miles of navigable grade A two star waters of the river Tees from the barrage up to the Low Moor Weir at Low Worsall beyond Yarm. Operation of the river below the barrage is the responsibility of the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority. Large quantities of natural debris such as branches are being washed down and caught by the barrage that otherwise would have been taken out to sea, and there are ongoing studies looking into the feasibility of burning this debris for power generation in waste-to-energy power stations.  Barge Lock  Tees barrage barge lock The lock is a single-rise lock with two pairs of lock gates to allow light river traffic to negotiate the barrage. The dimensions of the lock are length 24.88 m, beam 6.08 m, height 5.37 m with a draught of 2.48 m. If necessary, when the lock is in use, a single leaf steel bascule lifting bridge over the lock is raised to allow the passage of lock traffic. There is no charge to use the lock however users must have permits to use the river both above and below the barrage. = Tidal Turbine Test Facility = On 8 June 2007 a new facility was opened for testing prototype marine current turbines and other turbine devices. This facility is operated and funded by the National Renewable Energy Centre. It uses the hydraulic head in the barge lock to release water through sluices at a controlled velocity to create a simulation of steady ocean current conditions downstream of the lock. The first turbine to be tested at this site was Evopod, a semi submerged floating tidal turbine developed by offshore consultancy Ocean Flow Energy Ltd based in North Shields. The test was largely a success and further devices are booked including a Rugged Renewables Savonius rotor that is to be deployed as a building-mounted turbine. The development of this facility completes NaREC's portfolio of test facilities.  Tees Barrage International White Water Course  As part of the project, an artificial whitewater course was created that has since hosted many significant watersport competitions. The ¬£4.6 million facility was opened ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. It produces its own green energy, which it feeds back into the National Grid.  Footbridge  View along the footbridge/cycleway with north bank pavilion in the background A steel footbridge carries walkers and cyclists across the concrete piers of the barrage on the Teesdale Way, part of the National Cycle Network. The footbridge consists of two parts, a steel footbridge across the concrete piers and a hydraulically operated single-leaf steel bascule across the lock to allow river craft to pass. Although the public cannot gain direct access to the barrage itself, the footbridge affords excellent views of the fish belly plates and hydraulics.  Fish pass  To allow migratory salmon and sea trout to negotiate the barrage a fish pass with fish counter and viewing area is installed next to the north bank pavilion. Some angling groups argue that the progress of migratory fish is delayed below the barrier as fish have difficulty finding the very narrow entrance to the fish pass and that excessive numbers of foraging seals are taking advantage of this delay and are predating these fish and thus damaging the recovery of salmonids on the Tees. The fish pass still only has provisional approval from the Environment Agency and as an interim measure fish pen stocks are being used on the river and the barrage lock is being operated in such a way as to allow fish to pass. Starting in April 2008 British Waterways commissioned a three-year electronic fish tagging survey to help understand the interactions and relationships between various wildlife at the barrage focusing on seal numbers and salmonid migration.

His greatest success came with the publication of his memoirs And When Did You Last See Your Father? which won the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography. He has also written a study of the murder of James Bulger, As If. Since 2003, Morrison has been Professor of Creative and Life Writing at Goldsmiths College, University of London. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Life and career Morrison was born in Skipton, North Yorkshire, to an English father and an Irish mother. His parents were both physicians; his mother's maiden name was Agnes O'Shea, but her husband persuaded her to change \\"Agnes\\" to \\"Kim\\". The details of his mother's life in Ireland, to which he had not been privy, formed the basis for his memoir, Things My Mother Never Told Me. Morrison lived in Thornton-in- Craven and attended Ermysted's Grammar School. He later studied English literature at the University of Nottingham and UCL. He worked for The Times Literary Supplement (1978‚Äì81) and was literary editor of both The Observer (1981‚Äì89) and the Independent on Sunday (1989‚Äì95). Morrison's early writing career outside of journalism was as a poet and poetry critic. He became a full-time writer in 1995 and has since produced novels and volumes of autobiography as well as plays, libretti, and writing for television. He has contributed articles to The New Yorker, the London Review of Books, the New Statesman, The New York Times and Poetry Review and since 2001 he has written regularly for The Guardian. In 2003 he became Professor of Creative and Life Writing at Goldsmiths College, London, and in 2008 he became chair of The Reader Organisation, the UK centre for research and promotion of reading as a therapeutic activity. In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts by Plymouth University. Published works His first book was The Movement: English Poetry and Fiction of the 1950s (Oxford University Press, 1980). This was followed in 1982 by a critical guide to Seamus Heaney's poetry. Also in 1982 he co-edited The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry with Andrew Motion. Morrison's first book of poetry, Dark Glasses, was published by Chatto and Windus in 1984. Other published works include Ballad of the Yorkshire Ripper (1986), written in Yorkshire dialect, and Pendle Witches (1996), illustrated with etchings by Paula Rego. His poems have also appeared in several anthologies, including Penguin Modern Poets 1 (1995). His first novel was The Justification of Johann Gutenberg (Chatto & Windus, 2000); South of the River was published in April 2007. Film, television and theatre adaptations And When Did You Last See Your Father? was made into a film starring Jim Broadbent as Morrison's father, Juliet Stevenson as his mother, Gina McKee as his wife, Sarah Lancashire as Aunty Beaty, and Colin Firth and Matthew Beard playing Blake Morrison himself as an adult and teenager, respectively. It was directed by Anand Tucker, produced by Elizabeth Karlsson, with a screenplay by David Nicholls. Filming took place in Cromford, Derbyshire, and the surrounding area. The film was released in 2007. A three- part television adaptation of Morrison's 2010 novel The Last Weekend was shown on ITV1 in August‚ÄìSeptember 2012. The TV series of Morrison's novel South of the River is being made by World Productions and adapted by screenwriter Danny Brocklehurst.

NSU is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents and offers 38 majors and 42 minors, as well as six associate, eight pre-professional and nine graduate degrees. History Founded on the intersection of the southern and eastern branches of the Milwaukee Railroad, Aberdeen, South Dakota saw a rapid growth in its population during the late 19th century; this rapid growth led the citizens of northern South Dakota to push for a government-funded institute of higher learning. During the 1885 legislative session, a bill was passed creating what was known at that time as the University of Central Dakota, to be located in the small town of Ordway, South Dakota. However, funds were not approved for the school until the 1887 legislative session.Bartusis, Mark C. Northern State University: The First Century 1901-2000. Aberdeen, SD: Northern State University Press, 2001. Even though the funds had been approved the bill had been vetoed by Governor Louis K. Church for financial considerations and the statewide lack of support; it would take a few more decades before the school became a reality. In 1900 Aberdeen had the fastest growing population in northern South Dakota and supporters for the school began to organize in greater numbers. On January 7, 1899, Senator Lawson, often thought to be the father of the Northern Normal and Industrial School, proposed a bill for the creation of the school in Aberdeen; the bill went through many revisions and it would not be until March 2, 1899 that the new school would exist on paper; however both a site and funding were still needed.Northern State University, South Dakota Secretary of State. December 1, 2006. Wealthy Aberdonians quickly responded and started to donate their land for the school; responding to the demand to pick a site, the Aberdeen City Council created a committee of twenty-five individuals responsible for choosing the location. The committee was composed of the well- to-do individuals of Aberdeen, including Ira Barnes, W.F.T Bushnell, C.F. Easton, F.W. Brooks, Ed Askew, B.C. Lamont, William Tennant, W.G Bickellhaupt, James Lawson, and Andrew Melgaard. The committee met through most of the early months of 1899 and adjourned in late spring before any decision was made. By late 1899 Governor Andrew E. Lee made the decision to use the land, just south of city limits, donated by Andrew Melgaard; however, the northern border of Melgaard's land did not extend all the way to Twelfth Avenue as Governor Lee had wanted; the land between Melgaard's northern border and Twelfth Avenue was owned by D.C and W.R Thomas of Watertown. In order for the state to receive the land as a donation, the committee had to pay Melgaard and the Thomases for their land. On November 10, the Thomases sold the two half-blocks in question to the state of South Dakota for one dollar and Andrew Melgaard received thirteen hundred for his plot of land. Now the state was left with the task of funding the construction of the new school. Approved by Governor Herreid on March 6, 1901, $28,000 was allotted for the construction of the school, and an additional $2000 allowed for the building of a heating plant. Under the supervision of the Board of Regents, the construction was to be completed and ready for students by September 1, 1902. Additional funding was allotted in yet another legislative bill for expenses such as salaries, lights, fuel, furniture, and maintenance; now everything was in place for the creation of Northern Normal and Industrial School. The first president of the Northern Normal and Industrial School, Charles F. Koehler, opened the school with the purpose of providing students with an education in academic studies. The initial admission requirements were simple: the applicant must be at least fourteen years of age and have a desire to teach. Students entering the school with a high school diploma placed them into a one-year \\"High School Course\\" that prepared them to teach, students that had completed at least eighth grade entered into either a four-year \\"English Course\\" or \\"Latin Course\\", and there was great flexibility in the rules so that students could receive credit for the high school they completed even if a diploma was not obtained. In addition to the Normal programs and Industrial programs, there was also a Model School; it included children in grades one through four and gave potential teachers the opportunity to learn practical teaching methods and attitudes. The Northern Normal and Industrial School would spend the next decade and a half modifying and defining the mission of the school. The school saw changes in both policies and practices, as well as changes around the campus, with the addition and destruction of buildings. The school also experienced many unique events in its early years. A proud moment for the school came on October 23, 1911, when the president of the United States, William Howard Taft, gave a speech, combining foreign policy issues with the role of the Normal school, in the newly completed auditorium of the Administration Building. Good times for the school and country came to an abrupt halt in April 1917 when the United States declared war with Germany and entered World War I. Students at the school responded immediately to the war effort and celebrated \\"Loyalty Day\\" on April 19, 1917. The school was closed for the day as students marched down the streets singing patriotic songs and waving flags. The faculty also showed its patriotic side by instituting a rule stating that any young man that had requested a \\"school release\\" to fight overseas would be graduated; faculty members such as football Coach Strum, Professor Gillis, and Professor Stech joined the military ranks. The school newspaper, The Exponent, began publishing letters from former students that had been sent to the war front and gave the first glimpse into the hardships of war; the first letter to arrive at NNIS came from junior T. Otway Thomas: > While bombs are to be dodged, shrapnel to be watched, and rifle bullets > guarded against, the war-weary warrior thinks of home ... There is more > discussion of home than anything else when two pals get together ... It is > food for their friendship and if you could open a soldier's heart, you would > find the pictures of his sweetheart, mother, father, sister, or brothers and > children. His is the pride of love and affection, the feeling of deep and > unexpressed worry over the loved ones at home and the hope for a safe and > triumphant return to where he feels his heart would dwell in peace ... How > his very nature becomes imbued with the idea of one more being in the > society of his loved ones! ... He doesn't talk of it in any quick and > slighting way, but becomes a devout convert to the Godly essence in human- > kind Love. As love is far away, his thoughts are expressed on paper ... And > then when life becomes darkened and gets dim, like a drowning man he clings > to what he trusts, and that is Love, a longing to see his home before Death > overtakes him. And how he tenaciously holds on to the last thread of life, > only to life and experience those joyous sensations on the point of being > snatched from him! ... But alas! The poor fellow who has no such luck, but > on whose face creeps slowly and surely the paleness of Death, the gradual > knowledge that the Light of Life is fast waning and soon shall dawn a new > light; but e'er it shines, a faint prayer is whispered: \\"God bless those at > home!\\" The end of the war brought great relief to the country and students at NNIS; classes returned to normal, students were no longer sewing, knitting, or making bandages, students sent overseas were slowly returning and the flow of letters was dwindling; however, of the four hundred and forty-two students, alumni, and instructors who were sent overseas, thirteen never returned; their names have been engraved on a plaque, \\"Lest we forget' the sacrifice made by these men that liberty and equality might not perish from the earth.\\"A Brief History of NSU. Northern State University. November 25, 2006. The end of the war also brought a drastic decline in the number of teachers in rural South Dakota, the state responded by creating Normal departments in four-year high schools. This new policy proved to be troublesome for NNIS, because now it was not necessary to attend the school in order to teach in South Dakota, therefore enrollment declined. In response to the decline in enrollment, president at the time, Dr. Harold Foght, pushed to professionalize the teaching occupation, making it necessary to be certified to teach. The headline for the April 1920 issue of the Exponent read, \\"NNIS To Become Teacher's College,\\" making Dr. Foght's effort successful. The school was then reorganized into three divisions: the pre-normal division, junior-normal division, and senior-normal division; each division would have its own dean. NNIS was now able to award baccalaureate degrees; however, it would not be until 1939 that the State Legislature would change the school's name from Northern Normal and Industrial School to Northern State Teachers College.History. Northern State University November 29, 2006. The school had survived through the Great Depression and was now under a new title with new responsibilities; carrying out these responsibilities however would be no easy task: the Great Depression had left the school in debt, enrollment numbers were dropping and the world was entering into yet another war. Luckily, for Northern State Teachers College, Dr. Noah E. Steele was the school president and he presided over the school from his induction in 1939 until 1951; he increased enrollment numbers, constructed new additions to the campus, and helped the school get through World War II. The school had experienced many changes in WWII: it now offered a flight and ground pilot program to train future military pilots, established a defense school, and also began to offer basic engineering programs. In response to NSTC's changing size and programs South Dakota State Legislature changed the name in 1964 to Northern State College. For the next two decades, Northern State College would continue to improve the quality of education and make drastic changes to their campus. In 1987 Northern State College received the second-highest classification, from the Carnegie Commission, granted to any South Dakota college or University: Comprehensive I Institution. Then, two years later, on February 6, 1989, the state recognized this achievement and changed the name for the final time from Northern State College to Northern State University. Athletics The Northern State Wolves compete in 13 inter-collegiate sports. The athletic program began in 1902 with men's basketball, track and American football followed in 1903, and baseball in 1904. Northern State has had two national championships in women's basketball which occurred in 1992 and 1994. Today, Northern offers men's and women's cross country, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's indoor and outdoor track, women's soccer, women's fastpitch softball, volleyball, American football, wrestling, baseball, and women's swimming. Northern State is a member of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC), which consists of sixteen universities in five states: Bemidji State University (MN); Concordia University St. Paul (MN); University of Minnesota-Crookston; Minnesota State University Moorhead; University of Mary (ND); Northern State University (SD); Southwest Minnesota State University; Upper Iowa University; Wayne State College (NE); Winona State University (MN); University of Minnesota-Duluth; Augustana University; Minnesota State University, Mankato; St. Cloud State University (MN); Minot State University (ND); and University of Sioux Falls (SD). Northern State has been a member of the conference since 1978 and has the second smallest enrollment of the 16 member schools. In the 1990s, all members of the NSIC became members of NCAA Division II, after spending many years with dual membership with the NAIA. Campus Northern State's campus occupies 66 acres on the south side of Aberdeen. The oldest buildings on campus were built on the green, and the campus has expanded outward since. The buildings where the majority of classes meet are the H.P. Gerber Building, which houses the offices and classrooms for the School of Education, the Johnson Fine Arts Center, which is home of the fine arts department and also holds many level classes, and the Mewaldt-Jensen building, which has 16 classrooms, 13 laboratories, and 60 offices which house the mathematics, science, and business departments.The Campus. Northern State University. December 6, 2006. The oldest buildings on Northern's campus are Lincoln, Krikac, and Spafford. Spafford had the first gymnasium. Lincoln was the first residence hall but is now known as the office of business. The campus residence halls are Great Plains West, Great Plains East, Briscoe Hall, Kramer Hall, Wolves Memorial Suites, McArthur-Welsh Hall, and Steele Hall. Accommodations include single rooms, double rooms, and numerous suites, which include a bathroom and a living room. Great Plains East features also offers a Papa John's and a POD (provisions on demand) store. The Avera Student Center houses the Wolves Den dining hall, the Wolf Shoppe (campus bookstore), a Caribou Coffee/Einstein Bros. Bagels, the campus post office, and all student-related services, as well as several meeting rooms. It also houses offices including NSU Admissions, Student Affairs, the Counseling Center, Disability Services, and Avera Health Services. The Beulah Williams Library has several group study rooms, multimedia stations, NSU Archives, and an extensive collection of books. The athletic complex, the Joseph H. Barnett Physical Education and Convocation Center, was completed in 1987 and houses all of the coaches offices as well as several classrooms. Wachs Arena is named after 30-year Wolves basketball coach Bob Wachs, who won 532 games in his career which spanned from 1955 to 1985. The Basketball Court in named the Don Meyer Court, after Coach Don Meyer. The Harvey C. Jewett IV Regional Science Education Center is home to the NSU biology and chemistry departments. With state-of- the-art labs and equipment, this two-story facility is enhancing science education and undergraduate research on the Northern campus while offering community outreach opportunities to K-12 students around the area. With its prominent placement at the corner of Twelfth Avenue Southeast and South State Street, it also serves as a gateway to campus, with a wolf statue standing in front of the building. The NSU Regional Sports Complex, opening in fall 2021, will connect to the existing Barnett Center. The complex will also include the brand new Dacotah Bank Stadium, which will be home to NSU Wolves Football, and Koehler Hall of Fame Softball Field, which will be home to NSU Wolves Softball.

The strix (plural striges or strixes), in the mythology of classical antiquity, was a bird of ill omen, the product of metamorphosis, that fed on human flesh and blood. It also referred to witches and related malevolent folkloric beings. DescriptionPhysical appearance= The strix is described as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, greyish white wings, and hooked claws in Ovid's Fasti.Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, Fasti VI. 131‚Äì, , tr. This is the only thorough description of the strix in Classical literature. Elsewhere, it is described as being dark-colored. =Behavior= The strƒ´x () was a nocturnally crying creature which positioned its feet upwards and head below, according to a pre-300 BC Greek origin myth. It is probably meant to be (and translated as) an owl, but is highly suggestive of a bat which hangs upside-down. The strix in later folklore was a bird which squirted milk upon the lips of (human) infants. Pliny in his Natural History dismissed this as nonsense and remarked it was impossible to establish what bird was meant by this.Bostock, John; Riley, H.T., ed., tr., Pliny, The Natural History, xi.95. Naturalis Historia', xi.232. The same habit, where the strix foul-smellingly lactates onto an infant's lips is mentioned by Titinius, who noted the placement of a garlic on the infant was the prescribed amulet to ward against it.Titinius, in Ribbeck, Scaen. Rom. Poesis Fragg. II, 188, Latin passage quoted and discussed by . And p. 145, \\"[Pliny] found the Titinian strix\\". In the case of Ovid's striges, they threatened to do more harm than that. They were said to disembowel an infant and feed on its blood. Ovid allows the possibilities of the striges being birds of nature, or products of magic, or transformations by witches using magical incantations. Classical tales of bloodthirstinessGreek origin myth= According to Antoninus Liberalis's Metamorphoses, the strƒ´x () was a metamorphosis of Polyphonte; she and her bear-like sons Agrios and Oreios were transformed into birds as punishment for their cannibalism. Here the strix is described as (a bird) \\"that cries by night, without food or drink, with head below and tips of feet above, a harbinger of war and civil strife to men\\".Antoninus Liberalis, ŒúŒµœÑŒ±ŒºŒøœÅœÜœéœÉŒµœâŒΩ Œ£œÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒÆ 21, translated in , summarized in The tale only survives in the form as recorded by Antonius who flourished 100‚Äì300 AD, but it preserved an older tale from the lost Ornithologia by Boios, dated to before the end of 4th century BC. In this Greek myth, the ill-omened strƒ´x herself did not perpetrate harm on humans. But one paper suggests guilt by association with her sons,: \\"As woman-bird, she is .. possessed of a craving for human flesh and blood. Boio transfers this quality to her offspring in human form, to Agrios alone in avian form [vulture].\\" and seeks to reconstruct an ancient Greek belief in the man-eating strƒ´x dating back to this age (4th century BC).. Accepting Theodor Bergk's postulation that Plautus's Latin comedy was a reworking of a hypothetical \\"Greek original belonging to the Middle comedy of the fourth century.\\" In an opposing view, one study failed to find the ancient Greeks subscribing to the strƒ´x as a \\"terror\\" to mankind, but noted a widespread belief in Italy that it was a \\"bloodthirsty monster in bird form.\\" This study surmises that the Greeks later borrowed the concept of strix as witches, a concept articulated in Ovid, and one scholar estimates the Greeks adopted the strix as \\"child-murdering horrors\\" by the \\"last centuries BC\\". The modern Greek form may betray an influence of a Latin diminutive strigula. =Early passing reference in Latin= The first Latin allusion is in Plautus' comedy Pseudolus dated to 191 BC, in which an inferior cook's cuisine is metaphorized as the striges (\\"vampyre owls\\") devouring the diners' gastrointestinal organs while still alive, and shortening their lifespan.Riley, Henry Thomas tr. (1912)Pseudolus, Act. 3, Scene 2. Morris, E. P., ed. (1895)T. Macci Plauti Pseudolus 820, p. 57 and note, p. 171 Commentators point to this as attestation that the striges were regarded as man-eating (anthropophagism). =Ovid's account of striges attack= In Ovid's Fasti (8 AD), the striges targeted legendary king Procas in his cradle. The assault was detected and interrupted but left the infant with scars on his cheeks and discoloration of his complexion. A ritual to keep the striges away from the newborn prince was subsequently performed by the nymph Cranae (or goddess Carna), who owned a wand of whitethorn, (spina) given to her by Janus, which could expel evil from all doors. only refers to Carna obtaining her power as compensation for Janus raping her, but the earlier passage in Ovid states a white wand was given to her. Ovid, Fasti 6.110ff. Riley, Thomas H. (1851) tr., Fasti, p. 214ff. =Satyricon= Petronius's novel Satyricon (late 1st century AD) includes a tale told by the character Trimalchio, describing the striges that snatched away the body of a boy who had already died, substituting it with a straw doll. The striges made their presence known by their scream, and a manservant attending to the intrusion discovered a woman and ran her through with a sword so that she groaned, but his whole body turned livid and would die a few days later.Satyricon 63, quoted in Magical associations Pliny's comment that \\"[strix]...employed in maledictions\\" signified that its name invoked in \\"potent\\" magic curses according to one interpretation,, and note 10 but it may have only been used as curse-word, reflecting its regard as an accursed creature.mƒÉlƒïdƒ´co defined \\"II. In partic., a curse, imprecation\\" and \\"II B. transf., a cursed thing\\" in Lewis & Short. There are several examples of the strix's plumage, etc., said to be used as an ingredient in magic. Horace in his Epodes, wrote that the strix's feathers are an ingredient in a love potion,Made by \\"the witch Canidia\\": as has his contemporary Propertius.Propertius, iii, 6, 29. The woman Cynthia accuses her rival of using the love potion. . Medea's rejuvenating concoction which she boiled in a cauldron used a long list of ingredients, including the strix's wings.Ovid, Metamporphosis VII, 269. More, Brookes (1922), translation. Cited by The striges also came to mean \\"witches\\". One paper speculates that this meaning is as old as the 4th century BC, on the basis that in the origin myth of Boios, various names can be connected to the Macedonia-Thrace region well known for witches. But more concrete examples occur in Ovid's Fasti (early 1st century AD) where the striges as transformations of hags is offered as one possible explanation, and Sextus Pompeius Festus (fl. late 2nd century) glossed as \\"women who practice witchcraft\\" \\"(maleficis mulieribus)\\" or \\"flying women\\" (\\"witches\\" by transference)Frazer, James George (1929) ed., Ovid, Fasti 4, p. 143, notes to VI. 131. Underworld There are striges, vultures, and bubo owls which cry in the marshes in Hades, by the edge of Tartarus according to Seneca the Younger's tragedy Hercules Furens., 686ff; Wilson, Emily (2010) tr. , pp. 159‚Äì160. Seneca cited by : \\"Tartarean birds\\", etc. Also, according to the legend of Otus and Ephialtes, they were punished in Hades by being tied to a pillar with snakes, with a strix perched on that column.Hyginus, Fabulae 28, cited by . Medieval The legend of the strix survived into the Middle Ages, as recorded in Isidore's Etymologiae.Etymologiae book 12, ch. 7.42. In the 7th‚Äì8th century John of Damascus equated the stiriges (Greek plural: ) with the gelloudes (pl. of gelllo) in his entry Perƒ´ Strygg≈çn ).John of Damascus, I, p. 473 (), in Migne, Patrologia Graeca, p. 1604. Cited by He wrote that they sometimes had corporeal bodies and wore clothing, and sometimes appeared as spirits.John of Damascus, I, p. 473, in Migne, Patrologia Graeca, p. 1604.

Features  The area contains thousands of weathered limestone pillars. Some of the tallest pinnacles reach heights of up to 3.5m above the yellow sand base. The different types of formations include ones which are much taller than they are wide and resemble columnssuggesting the name of Pinnacleswhile others are only a meter or so in height and width resembling short tombstones. A cross-bedding structure can be observed in many pinnacles where the angle of deposited sand changed suddenly due to changes in prevailing winds during formation of the limestone beds. Pinnacles with tops similar to mushrooms are created when the calcrete capping is harder than the limestone layer below it. The relatively softer lower layers weather and erode at a faster rate than the top layer leaving behind more material at the top of the pinnacle.Pinnacles Desert Lookout and Drive  Formation  The Pinnacles during sunset The raw material for the limestone of the Pinnacles came from seashells in an earlier era that was rich in marine life. These shells were broken down into lime-rich sands that were blown inland to form high mobile dunes.Lipar, M., Webb, J.A., 2015. The formation of the pinnacle karst in Pleistocene aeolian calcarenites (Tamala Limestone) in southwestern Australia. Earth-Science Reviews 140, pp. 182-202 However, the manner in which such raw materials formed the Pinnacles is the subject of debate. Three major theories have been proposed: The first theory states that they were formed as dissolutional remnants of the Tamala Limestone, i.e. that they formed as a result of a period of extensive solutional weathering (karstification). Focused solution initially formed small solutional depressions, mainly solution pipes, which were progressively enlarged over time, resulting in the pinnacle topography. Some pinnacles represent cemented void infills (microbialites and/or re-deposited sand), which are more resistant to erosion, but dissolution still played the final role in pinnacle development.Lipar, M., 2009. Pinnacle syngenetic karst in Nambung National Park, Western Australia. Acta Carsologica 38 (1), pp. 41‚Äì50. A second theory states that they were formed through the preservation of tree casts buried in coastal aeolianites, where roots became groundwater conduits, resulting in the precipitation of indurated (hard) calcrete. Subsequent wind erosion of the aeolianite then exposed the calcrete pillars.Hearty, P.J., O‚ÄôLeary, M.J., 2008. Carbonate eolianites, quartz sands, and Quaternary sea- level cycles, Western Australia, A chronostratigraphic approach. Quaternary Geochronology 3, 26-55 A third proposal suggests that plants played an active role in the creation of the Pinnacles, based on the mechanism that formed smaller \\"root casts\\" in other parts of the world. As transpiration drew water through the soil to the roots, nutrients and other dissolved minerals flowed toward the root‚Äîa process termed \\"mass-flow\\" that can result in the accumulation of nutrients at the surface of the root, if the nutrients arrive in quantities greater than that needed for plant growth. In coastal aeolian sands that consist of large amounts of calcium (derived from marine shells), the movement of water to the roots would drive the flow of calcium to the root surface. This calcium accumulates at high concentrations around the roots and over time is converted into a calcrete. When the roots die, the space occupied by the root is subsequently also filled with a carbonate material derived from the calcium in the former tissue of the roots, and possibly also from water leaching through the structures. Although evidence has been provided for this mechanism in the formation of root casts in South Africa, evidence is still required for its role in the formation of the Pinnacles.Cramer MD, Hawkins H-J. 2009. A physiological mechanism for the formation of root casts. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 274: 125‚Äì133  Fauna and flora  Western grey kangaroos graze on the vegetation in the park, usually in the early morning. The kangaroos are considered quite tame, sometimes allowing quiet, slow-moving visitors to approach them. Baudin's black cockatoos and emus are frequently observed in the park. Reptiles such as bobtails, sand goannas and carpet pythons are a few of the other park inhabitants. Some of the common plant species include panjang (a low-lying wattle), coastal wattle and banjine, quandong, yellow tailflower, thick-leaved fanflower and cockies tongues. Parrot bush, candlestick banksia, firewood banksia and acorn banksia are also common in the park.  Tourism  The Pinnacles remained unknown to most Australians until 1967 when the area was gazetted as a reserve, which was later combined with two adjacent reserves to form Nambung National Park in 1994. Nambung National Park received about 150,000 visitors a year as of 2011. The Pinnacles Desert Discovery Centre was opened in 2008, offering interpretive displays of the park, both the natural processes that formed the Pinnacles and the biodiversity of the area. The best season to visit the Pinnacles is in the months of August to October, as the days are mild and wildflowers, along with wattle, begin to bloom in the spring. No lodging or camping areas are available within Nambung National Park but accommodations can be found in Cervantes.

It is one of the most important geological locations in Britain. It is also a Local Nature Reserve, a national nature reserve (NNR) and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The site is home to a number of species of birds and locally rare flora, such as Small Scabious, Milkwort and Quaking Grass. The caverns are also a nationally important hibernation site for seven different species of bat. The Wren's Nest National Nature ReserveAncient history= The Wren's Nest National Nature Reserve is world-famous geologically for its well-preserved Silurian coral reef fossils. Considered the most diverse and abundant fossil site in the British Isles, more than 700 types of fossil have been found at the site, 86 of which are unique to the location, including Calymene blumenbachii, a trilobite nicknamed the Dudley Bug or Dudley Locust by 18th century quarrymen. An image of this trilobite featured on the town's coat of arms until 1974. The limestone outcrops belong to the Wenlock Group, which was formed some 420 to 425 million years ago from the material remnants of an ancient tropical sea bed, and contain ripple marks made from the sea's action on the sand. Wren's Nest Hill was extensively quarried during the Industrial Revolution for building stone and lime production. The site was originally studied by the Scottish paleontologist Sir Roderick Murchison, whose work in defining the Silurian System was mainly based on fossils and rock formations found at the site. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Silurian sea bed fossils collected from Wren's Nest Nature Reserve, Dudley UK.

The caves were mined for hundreds of years for the valuable limestone, used firstly for mortar and agriculture, and then principally iron production during the Industrial Revolution. The Victorians installed the world's first industrial steam engine next to the Wren's Nest, which pumped water from mines and access tunnels. During the height of the Industrial Revolution, up to 20,000 tons of limestone was quarried annually. Local industrialisation was considerable at this time, as the district had become highly industrialised in the heyday of the Black Country's industrial past. When quarrying officially finished in 1925, the site was abandoned. =Recent history= Wren's Nest was declared a national nature reserve in 1956, the UK's first national nature reserve for geology. In 2004, Wren's Nest and the nearby Castle Hill were declared Scheduled Ancient Monuments, as they represented the best surviving remains of the limestone industry in Dudley. The most impressive part of this is the last remaining surface opening limestone cavern in the world ‚Äì formerly reaching more than 100 metres underground ‚Äì which is known as the Seven Sisters. The workings were originally connected by underground canal to the Dudley Tunnel complex, which has now been blocked off for safety reasons. The Wren's Nest's geological value was first recognised by Sir Roderick Murchison in 1839, and now both the ex-quarry and the tunnels are visited by scientists from all over the world to study its valuable content. The Seven Sisters tunnel complex Part of the Seven Sisters tunnel complex; This cave is in Castle Hill, just behind Dudley Castle. Considered one of the best surviving examples of limestone quarrying, the Seven Sisters caverns had to be filled in after a major roof collapse and mine cave-in occurred in 2001, to prevent further collapse. More recent work had also began on infilling the huge Cathedral Gallery with loose sand. The former limestone mine and adjacent vast underground canal basin, which leads to a now blocked off passage to Dudley Tunnel, contain some of what local historians claimed to be some of the world's most important geology and mining heritage. In 2007, Dudley Council lost out on a ¬£50,000,000 national lottery grant to redevelop and re-open the cavern complex, but did later secure an ¬£800,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund for lesser improvements to the site.

Assignment problems and the location of economic activities. Econometrica 25(1):53-76. The problem models the following real-life problem: :There are a set of n facilities and a set of n locations. For each pair of locations, a distance is specified and for each pair of facilities a weight or flow is specified (e.g., the amount of supplies transported between the two facilities). The problem is to assign all facilities to different locations with the goal of minimizing the sum of the distances multiplied by the corresponding flows. Intuitively, the cost function encourages factories with high flows between each other to be placed close together. The problem statement resembles that of the assignment problem, except that the cost function is expressed in terms of quadratic inequalities, hence the name. Formal mathematical definition The formal definition of the quadratic assignment problem is as follows: :Given two sets, P (\\"facilities\\") and L (\\"locations\\"), of equal size, together with a weight function w : P √ó P ‚Üí R and a distance function d : L √ó L ‚Üí R. Find the bijection f : P ‚Üí L (\\"assignment\\") such that the cost function: ::\\\\sum_{a,b\\\\in P}w(a,b)\\\\cdot d(f(a), f(b)) :is minimized. Usually weight and distance functions are viewed as square real-valued matrices, so that the cost function is written down as: :\\\\sum_{a,b\\\\in P}w_{a,b}d_{f(a),f(b)} In matrix notation: :\\\\min_{X\\\\in\\\\Pi_n} \\\\operatorname{trace}(WXDX^T) where \\\\Pi_n is the set of n \\\\times n permutation matrices, W is the weight matrix and D is the distance matrix.  Computational complexity  The problem is NP-hard, so there is no known algorithm for solving this problem in polynomial time, and even small instances may require long computation time. It was also proven that the problem does not have an approximation algorithm running in polynomial time for any (constant) factor, unless P = NP. The travelling salesman problem may be seen as a special case of QAP if one assumes that the flows connect all facilities only along a single ring, all flows have the same non-zero (constant) value. Many other problems of standard combinatorial optimization problems may be written in this form.  Applications  In addition to the original plant location formulation, QAP is a mathematical model for the problem of placement of interconnected electronic components onto a printed circuit board or on a microchip, which is part of the place and route stage of computer aided design in the electronics industry.

It is a part of the 15th arrondissement of the city. There is currently a Boulevard de Grenelle which runs along the North delimitation of the quartier, and a Rue de Grenelle, a few kilometers North- East in the 7th arrondissement.  History  In 52 BC, Garanella plain was the site of the Battle of Lutetia between the troops of the Gaulish chief Camulog√®ne and the Roman legion under General Labienus. Despite their courageous resistance, the Gauls were defeated. Towards the middle of the 13th century, Grenelle became a fiefdom of the Abbey of St Genevieve and became part of the village of Vaugirard. On May 15, 1824, two city councillors from Vaugirard, Jean-L√©onard Violet and Alphonse Letellier, bought and divided up Grenelle plain. They did this rather quickly, and the new quartier Beaugrenelle was founded on June 27, 1824. Thenceforth, under the encouragement of a group of entrepreneurs (the Compagnie des Entrepreneurs, founded by Violet and Letellier), the quartier continued to develop, occasionally provoking feelings of hostility from residents of old Vaugirard. Thus, on May 13, 1829, following the refusal of the city to install oil lamps, the residents of Beaugrenelle demanded to break off from Vaugirard, a separation which took place the next year. However, it was to be short-lived. On 1 January 1860, despite the objections of the residents of Grenelle, Baron Haussmann decided to annex Grenelle, Vaugirard, and Javel, thus creating the 15th arrondissement.

Taxonomy  A species described by George Waterhouse in 1846. The type specimen was collected at Coorong in South Australia. The author cites an earlier name, Halmaturus greyii, published by John Edward Gray in 1843 without a valid description, assigning it to a subgenus of the same name‚ÄîMacropus (Halmaturus)‚Äîand providing the common name of the newly described species as Grey's wallaby. The common name and epithet greyi commemorates the collector and explorer George Grey, who provided the two specimens to researchers at the British Museum of Natural History. A systematic revision has seen the species placed in a subgeneric arrangement as Macropus (Notamacropus) greyi, recognising an affinity with eight other species of the subgenus named as Notamacropus Dawson and Flannery, 1985. An arrangement that elevates the subgenera of Macropus is recognised as Notamacropus greyi. A genetic analysis found that its closest relative is the western brush wallaby. The common names have also included monkeyface and onetwo.  Description  Henry Richter in John Gould's Mammals of Australia (1863) The toolache wallaby was a slim, graceful, and elegant creature that had a pale ashy-brown pelt with a buff- yellow underbelly. The tail was pale grey and became almost white near the tip. The distinct black mark on its face reached from its nose to the eye. The forearms, feet, and tips of the ears were also black. The different colours of the animal also consisted of different textured furs which are believed to have changed seasonally or varied depending on the individual. The body measurements differed between males and females. In general, male toolache wallabies had a head and body length up to 810 mm while females measured up as 840 mm. Despite the females being taller, males had longer tail lengths at about 730 mm while the female's tail length was 710 mm.  Behaviour  The toolache wallaby was a nocturnal animal, foraging for vegetation during the twilight hours of the day. Their movements were unusual and extremely rapid, able to outpace almost any terrestrial predator; they were known to evade the fastest dogs of the colonial hunters.  Habitat  The toolache wallaby occupied the southeastern corner of Australia to the western part of Victoria. The preferred habitat ranged from swampy short grassland areas, to taller grassed areas of the open country. Toolache wallabies were known to be sociable creatures who lived in groups; they were often seen resting and grazing in groups.  Threats  A combination of numerous threats caused the decline and eventual extinction of the toolache wallaby. One of the largest factors was the destruction of its habitat. Since swamps were an important part of its habitat, once they were cleared out, much of the vegetation went with it. Besides the destruction of its habitat, the introduction of predators, such as the European red fox, began to kill off the species as well. On top of all this, the animal was also hunted for sport and for its beautiful pelt.Also, what is not well known about the extinction threat to this species was the effect of the direct predation of the aboriginal population and their introduction of Dingos where macropods generally resided.  Extinction  The toolache wallaby only survived 85 years after European occupation. In the 1920s, a conservation effort was made to try and bring the animal back from the brink of extinction. The plan was to capture and breed the last known surviving members of the species in captivity. This effort ended in disaster after 10 of the 14 of them were accidentally killed in the attempt to capture them. The remaining four survived in captivity. The last wild sightings were recorded in 1924, and the last known toolache wallaby survived in captivity until 1939. The species is presumed to be extinct, although extensive research is still being conducted in the region after reports of suspected sightings through the 1970s. However, no members of the species have been sighted since. References *Flannery, T. and P. Schouten, A Gap in Nature, Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001, pg. 152.

Hosted by Tsinghua University, it is recognized for its diversity and depth of topics. Access to the SMTH BBS was restricted to on-campus IPs since March 16, 2005, effectively blocking away a substantial portion of its contributors, ranging from graduates living overseas to students from other universities in China. A small protest was held at the elite university against tightening government censorship on the Internet. Early in 2006, the SMTH BBS reopened itself to the alien IPs from outside Tsinghua University, available to those who would confirm their identification using a valid email account. However, a large number of its discussion groups are still under tight control, refusing visits from the outside world. 1995: How it All Began In early August 1995, ace set up a BBS site on a Linux/386 machine in one of the laboratories of the Tsinghua University. Later, ming and lucky joined the endeavor and transferred the system onto a SUN Sparc 20 with 64M memory. On August 8, the BBS formally declared open, and was named \\"Shui Mu Tsing Hua\\", often abbreviated as SMTH, which in Chinese means \\"Water is clear, with trees in florescence\\", referring to a line in an ancient poem and an actual site in Tsinghua University. The IP address then was 166.111.1.11. In October, SMTH started to provide MUD service. Since November 27, SMTH was accessible through a service of World Wide Web (WWW). At the end of 1995, the number of the registered users at SMTH reached around several dozen. 1996 Between March and April, the SMTH community organized a kite-flying party and received a large publicity nationwide as CCTV (China Central Television) recorded and aired the event in its Our Generation program. SMTH was accessible to the entire campus community around the end of April and saw its traffic peaked. The number of online visitors often ran to the triple digits. September 18, 1996, radical opinions regarding Diaoyu Islands (as known in China, Senkaku Islands as known in Japan) issue appeared on many BBSes across China. The government reacted by closely monitoring these BBSes. Two sites in Peking University were temporarily shut down. SMTH was closed for one day. The following month, SMTH closed its Military, History, Salon and Time-Space Report discussion groups. At the end of October, a new system named FireBird BBS replaced the former one. Before that, the system administrators did a massive overhaul on the original Firebird system. In November, the second version of the WWW-BBS architecture was implemented. In December, SMTH experienced a severe hard drive breakdown, resulting in the loss of two months worth of information. 1997 In January, having recovered from its hard drive failure, SMTH reopened without WWW access. At the same time, Tsinghua University BBS Regulations came into effect. At the end of February, due to the death of Deng Xiaoping, SMTH was temporarily closed. It reopened again on the third of April, with its IP address changed to 202.112.58.200. Late June, the SMTH community launched a fund-raising campaign for a student who fell seriously ill. Late September, the SMTH BBS administration was established and began its first term. SMTH's management and maintenance became regularized. 1998 On March 4, SMTH was again closed during the period when both the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference were on session. It reopened on April 1. In June, the site experienced another scheduled shut-down. When it was online again on June 15, users organized an offline get-together, a party they called happy98. On December 9, in the atmosphere of The Asian Olympics Games, SMTH created a temporary discussion group devoted to the news and analysis of the event, setting a precedent example for all major sports events to follow. 1999 On the eighth of May, American missiles attacked the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia. Many users simultaneously expressed their agony on SMTH, causing a surge in its site traffic. On December 18, SMTH acquired the domains smth.org and smth.edu.cn. 2005: From Public to Restricted The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China issued a mandate in 2005, demanding all university BBS sites to be reformed into campus-wide communication platforms and requiring users to register under their legal names. SMTH BBS was made to be the pioneering example for other universities to follow. In response, Tsinghua University decided to turn SMTH from a public BBS into a campus-restricted BBS effective March 16, 2005. In the afternoon of the same day, the BBS' Administrative Committee issued \\"An Open Letter to All Users of SMTH\\", stating their stance on users outside the university. \\"The history of SMTH in the past decade has shown that, with a friendly community atmosphere, good academic discussion, development of informational sections and effective, strict internal site management, users outside the campus are not the cause of mismanagement, nor the source of various destabilizing elements. On the contrary, a fully open, strictly managed off-campus user community has proven to be instrumental to SMTH's vigor and quality, and hence contributes in a tremendous way to the upholding of the academic reputation of the University.\\" The Committee went on stating that, \\"Users outside the campus are an extremely important source to the vibrant culture of SMTH. Come what may, SMTH will never forget its many users outside the campus, past, present or future.\\" At the same time, many public users found they were unable to connect to SMTH normally. Instead, they were greeted with the welcome message: \\"Effective from today, BBS SMTH is restricted to only on-campus access. All outside IP's are blocked.\\" March 16, after a brief recovery of service, Lily, the BBS of Nanjing University,ÁôæÂêà, became \\"read only\\", depriving all users of their posting privileges. March 17, many university BBSes (including Unnamed of Peking University, Terra Cotta of Xi'an Jiaotong University, etc.) closed their public access one after another. Meanwhile, searching keyword \\"Tsinghua University\\" in the popular Baidu search engine no longer returns the entry \\"Tsinghua University BBS\\" which used to rank the second. Similar screening has been done to other university BBSes as well. Shortly after the blocking, students of Tsinghua University found various means to express their discontent. They produced large amount of screenshots of previous greeting messages of SMTH to express their condolences, hope or criticism. On March 18, students of the University voluntarily organized a gathering. Many people expressed their sadness by folding numerous paper cranes. Post-3/16: New Era On March 8, 2005, the Network Research Center of Tsinghua University (NRCOTU) urged the SMTH BBS administration to block THUExpress, one of the SMTH's most visited and prosperous discussion group, from access by alien IPs from outside campus, and indicated that it was due to a pressure from the Ministry of Education. On the afternoon of March 16, the NRCOTU put the machine that runs SMTH under its tight control, blocking all alien IPs outside of campus, and rewrote the telnet log-in welcome message as \\"From today onward, SMTH BBS has re- established itself as a campus-only site as opposed to its former publicity and offers only limited access for alien IPs.\\" Early on the morning of March 17, the SMTH administration issued an announcement saying the SMTH BBS was undergoing a period of abnormality with an aura of their impossibility to resolve the problem. The administration said that, under the pressure from the University, \\"the possibility to reverse the status quo is but zero\\"'. From March to April, the SMTH administration went to many negotiations with the University, expressing that they were willing to restore the SMTH to a pre-3/16 one and help do some reasonable adjustment on the regulation of BBS activities, which received from the University a response saying \\"we hope things would be under control\\". And it was said that the SMTH administration was then planning to move the valuable data of the SMTH BBS out of the campus onto a new site that would rival the on-campus one. However, the plan had not been officially claimed then. On the morning of April 14, Chen Maoke, along with some guys from the NRCOTU, broke into the room that hosted the SMTH machine, from which they removed the cables connecting the data hard drive stand causing a breakdown of service. And they reconnected the hard drive stand to another machine where they had absolute root privileges to control everything. What they had done had ensured the data consistency but through a coup of administration. In the afternoon, the SMTH administration announced that \\"Because SMTH is no longer under our control, we are not able to secure all users' data. And it is suggested that each of you see to it all on your own.\\" On April 15, the SMTH administration was temporarily dismissed. April 19, the members of the SMTH administration announced their resignations \\"due to a failure of the NRCOTU to truly and completely explain the event as a whole and its violation of the administrative regulations of the SMTH BBS\\". On April 20, the NRCOTU issued an announcement in return to deprive the sixteen SMTH administration members of their authority on SMTH. On the same day, the smthbbs, a descendant of Firebird BBS, maintained by the SMTH BBS developing team, was announced to be renamed as K Board System, or KBS. And its Web features, the original work by the SMTH BBS developing team, was announced to have been under a non-GPLed, private license. On May 2, the domain name smth.org was re-claimed by its owner. And since July, this domain name started to point at newsmth.net. Registration Currently, there are only 2 types of users are allowed to open a new account.

Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2009. was an Irish scholar of the Celtic languages, particularly in the fields of historical linguistics and Irish dialects. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy and died in Dublin in 1953. He is the creator of O'Rahilly's historical model, which has a mixed legacy.  Early years and education  He was born in Listowel, County Kerry, Ireland to Thomas Francis Rahilly of Ballylongford, Co. Kerry and Julia Mary Rahilly (n√©e Curry) of Glin, Co. Limerick. He was the seventh of his parents fifteen children. He received his secondary education at St. Michael's College, Listowel, and later at Blackrock College in Dublin at the same time as future Irish politician √âamon de Valera.UK Census 1901 held in the National Archives in the Republic of Ireland O'Rahilly is listed as Rahilly and de Valera as Edward. He took an interest in Irish and Celtic languages early in his life, buying Irish language newspaper An Claidheamh Soluis with his pocket money while still a school boy. De Valera commented on this unusual sight: > If O'Rahilly had been reading Greek I would not have been too surprised; I > could attempt that myself. But to be reading Gaelic from a newspaper - that > was something extraordinary indeed in those days. He was educated at the Royal University of Ireland, and received his B.A. in Irish and Classics in 1905. He spent a year teaching Irish at University College Dublin, before taking up a permanent position as a clerk in the Four Courts in 1906, where he stayed until 1919. On 17 October 1918 he married Mary Buckley in Carrigtwohill, Co. Cork. They had no children.  Academic career  O'Rahilly worked full-time in the Irish civil service as a clerk in the Four Courts. He founded and edited journal Gadelica: a Journal of Modern Irish Studies which \\"sought to pursue and promote investigation into the area of Celtic studies, including philology\\". The journal was short-lived due to a shortage of subscriptions and four issues were published between 1912-1913. He completed his MA thesis The Accentuation of Gaelic in 1916. Fellow Celtic languages scholar and lecturer of Trinity College, Dublin Eleanor Knott described his work during this period: > His unsurpassed knowledge of modern Irish dialects and manuscript literature > was acquired in his early manhood when as a civil servant his chosen studies > had perforce to be relegated to evenings, weekends and vacations. Unceasing > application during this period together with recurrent attacks of influenza > brought about a definite decline in his health and this should be taken into > account in considering a characteristic asperity in criticising the work of > other scholars. In 1919 he entered academic life in a full-time capacity upon taking up his first professorship in Irish at Trinity College, Dublin (1919-1929). He was appointed research professor in Celtic languages in 1929 at University College Cork and stayed in this position until 1935.Thomas Francis O'Rahilly Papers 1883-1953. Queen's University Belfast Special Collections & Archives. Retrieved 28 August 2020. He returned to academic life in Dublin as professor of Celtic languages at University College Dublin (1935-1941). He was director of the School of Celtic Studies at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies from 1942 to 1947. He received an honorary degree in D.Litt.Celt. from the National University of Ireland in 1928 and D.Litt. from Trinity College, Dublin in 1948. O'Rahilly edited Celtica, a journal of the School of Celtic Studies at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, between 1946 and 1950. Other publications by O'Rahilly include a series of anthologies of Irish language poetry publish in the 1920s.  Later years  O'Rahilly retired from academia in 1948. He suffered from poor health for many years and died suddenly on 16 November 1953 at his home. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. His wife believed that his death was due to overwork and burned many of his remaining papers at their home. Some of his surviving papers are held by School of Celtic Studies at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. His collection of books, correspondence, and Irish manuscripts, including an annotated draft of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, were bequeathed to the Queen's University of Belfast.  Controversies  O'Rahilly was known for his sometimes controversial theories of Irish history. In his book Early Irish History and Mythology, first published in 1946, O'Rahilly developed an influential model of Irish prehistory based on critical reading of early Irish literary sources, involving four waves of Celtic-speaking invaders. Although O'Rahilly's model was highly influential, it has been challenged in the following decades by Celtic scholars such as Kenneth H. Jackson and John T. Koch. In 1942 his lecture where he proposed that there were two Saint Patricks, was published. Irish author James Plunkett described the controversy caused by O'Rahilly's theory: > I can still recall the great scandal of 1942, when a book called The Two > Patricks was published by a learned Irish Professor who advanced the theory > that there was one Patrick (Palladius Patrick) whose mission lasted from > 432-461, and another who arrived in 462 and died about 490. The suggestion > caused a national unheaval. If the careers of the two Patricks, through > scholarly bungling, had become inextricably entangled, who did what? And > worse still - which of them was the patron saint? If you addressed a prayer > to one, might it not be delivered by mistake to the other? There was a > feeling abroad that any concession to the two Patricks theory would lead > unfailingly to a theory of no Patrick at all. His views on language contact and bilingualism were equally controversial. In Irish Dialects Past and Present (1932) he wrote the following about the Manx language: > From the beginning of its career as a written language English influence > played havoc with its syntax, and it could be said without much exaggeration > that some of the Manx that has been printed is merely English disguised in a > Manx vocabulary. Manx hardly deserved to live. When a language surrenders > itself to foreign idiom, and when all its speakers become bilingual, the > penalty is death. This view has more recently been challenged by Nicholas Williams, who suggests that Manx is Gaelic pidginized by early contact with Norse, long before there was any English spoken on the Isle of Man.  Family  His sister Cecile O'Rahilly was also a Celtic scholar, and published editions of both recensions of the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge and worked with her brother in the School of Celtic Studies at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.N√≠ Mhunghaile, Lesa. \\"O'Rahilly (N√≠ Rathaille, √ì Rathaille), Cecile (Sisile)\\".

The diocese comprises Alameda and Contra Costa Counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Cathedral of Christ the Light serves as the bishop's seat, replacing the Cathedral of Saint Francis de Sales which was demolished after the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. Once a part of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the Diocese of Oakland remains a suffragan of the ecclesiastical province of San Francisco. Its fellow suffragans include the dioceses of Honolulu, Las Vegas, Reno, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Jose, Santa Rosa and Stockton. The patron saints of the Diocese of Oakland are the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Francis de Sales. History Mission San Jos√© is the location of the first parish. The first known Mass celebrated in the area that would become the Diocese of Oakland was on March 27, 1772, by Father Juan Cresp√≠ on the shores of Lake Merritt. Twenty five years later, Mission San Jos√© was established in what is now Fremont, becoming the first parish in the area. Within time, Mission San Jos√© became the most prosperous of the California Missions. After secularization by the Mexican government the mission remained an integral part of the area with many of the early pioneer families sharing close ties with the mission. In the 1820s the Peralta family, landowners of much of what would become Alameda County, built a chapel on the grounds of Rancho San Antonio in present-day Oakland. The chapel was served by priests from the mission and was called Saint Anthony's chapel. The area came under episcopal control in 1840 with the establishment of the Diocese of the Two Californians. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1850, the diocese was split in two with the Diocese of Monterey in California administering the areas under American control. In 1853 Joseph Sadoc Alemany, the Bishop of Monterey, moved his seat to San Francisco and became the first Archbishop of San Francisco. At that time Mission San Jos√© was the only parish in the East Bay. In 1858, Archbishop Alemany sent Father James Croke to establish a parish in Oakland. Fr. Croke founded St. Mary, Immaculate Conception at Eighth and Jefferson Streets. By the turn of the twentieth century many parishes were formed in Berkeley, Fremont, Livermore, Hayward, Oakland, and San Leandro to reflect the growing populations in the East Bay. After World War II rapid growth in the San Francisco region led Pope John XXIII to establish the Diocese of Oakland in 1962 from the eastern portion of the San Francisco Archdiocese. Saint Frances de Sales was established as the diocesan mother church and Floyd Begin of Cleveland, Ohio, was installed as Oakland's first bishop. In the following decades the Cathedral of Saint Francis de Sales developed a national reputation for lively liturgies and for social ministries. The cathedral parish was also known for its excellence in music, developing what was called the \\"Oakland Cathedral Sound\\". Unfortunately, the cathedral church suffered damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The diocese deemed the repairs too costly (estimates were at $8 million for both the Cathedral and Sacred Heart Church) and instead opted to demolish the churches. In May 2005, ground was broken for the new $131 million Cathedral of Christ the Light, located on the shores of Lake Merritt in Oakland. The new cathedral opened in 2008 with a new parish formed out of the then cathedral parish of Saint Mary-Saint Francis de Sales. In May 2020, it was revealed that the Diocese of Oakland was undergoing a sex abuse lawsuit.https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/26/catholic-priest- sexual-abuse-survivor-suing-oakland-diocese-and-east-bay-churches/ In July 2020, Rev.

There are currently 84 parishes located in the diocese and 16 pastoral centers. As the Bay Area is known for a diverse population, the diocese celebrates Mass in 15 different languages including Spanish, American Sign Language, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Latin (Mass of Paul VI and Tridentine Mass). The diocesan Department of Catholic Schools administers over forty-seven elementary/middle schools and nine high schools serving over 19,000 students. Some of the more notable schools include De La Salle High School, known nationally as a football powerhouse, St. Joseph Notre Dame High School in Alameda, known as having state championship basketball teams, Bishop O'Dowd High School, and Salesian College Preparatory. In addition to the elementary and high schools, seven universities and seminaries are located within the Diocese of Oakland, including: *Graduate Theological Union Affiliates :*Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology :*Franciscan School of Theology :*Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley :*The School of Applied Theology *St. Mary's College of California *Holy Names University * Queen of the Holy Rosary College (Community College) BishopsBishops of Oakland= The list of bishops of the diocese and their terms of service: # Floyd Lawrence Begin (1962‚Äì1977) # John Stephen Cummins (1977‚Äì2003) # Allen Henry Vigneron (2003‚Äì2009), appointed Archbishop of Detroit # Salvatore Cordileone (2009‚Äì2012), appointed Archbishop of San Francisco # Michael C.

Child molestation scandals St. Francis de Sales Cathedral The diocese has suffered from Catholic sex abuse cases which were brought forward by parishioners against some of its priests. From 1994 through 2009, the diocese paid $60.5 million to its victims of sexual abuse, the largest payments being made in 2004 and 2005. At least 64 Roman Catholic clergy members accused of molesting children have served in 61 of the 86 parishes in the Oakland diocese, and in all seven of the diocese's male-run high schools. The Diocese has only acknowledged 12 of the molesters, according to a 2008 MediaNews analysis of court and church records. Nine diocesan clergy have been accused of molesting four or more children each, according to Dan McNevin of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), and court records. Monsignor Vincent Breen was accused of abusing at least fifteen girls, and Monsignor George Francis nine girls. The Reverend James Clark was accused of abusing four children, the Reverend Arthur Ribeiro four, the Reverend Robert Freitas five, the Reverend Gary Tollner six, the Reverend Robert Ponciroli eight, the Reverend Donald Broderson eleven, and the Reverend Stephen Kiesle fifteen. One of the victims, Linda Chapin, was awarded $3 million in a 2004 settlement reached with the diocese, related to her accusation that George Francis raped her \\"ritualistically and sadistically\\" several times beginning when she was six years old. Francis died in 1998. Upon winning her settlement, Chapin called upon the diocese to \\"name all the priests that there are credible allegations against.\\" In 2005, Tim Stier, priest at the Corpus Christi Catholic Church in Fremont, California, stepped down from his 25-year service with the Oakland diocese in protest at its failure to address sexuality problems in priests. Stier described the diocese as hiding or ignoring the child sex abuse cases, and not holding its leaders accountable. He said, \\"It's not as if I'm a perfect person and I don't have weaknesses and sin. But there is a level of dishonesty and arrogance in this that just tells me we need systemic, radical change.\\" Stier has since endorsed such innovations as female priests, married priests, openly gay priests and married gay priests.\\"What You Won't Hear in Your Parish\\" , T. Stier, Apr. 7, 2010 In 2010, Stephen Kiesle was accused of abusing an 11-year-old girl, Teresa Rosson, from 1972, the year he was ordained, until 2001, two decades after he had been removed from the priesthood. Kiesle married Rosson's mother in 1982. In 1978, Kiesle had pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of lewd conduct for tying up and molesting two boys in a church rectory and was removed from his duties as a priest. From 1985 to 1988, Kiesle volunteered as a youth minister in a parish in Pinole, but was removed after a worker in the Diocese's Office of Youth Ministry complained. Kiesle was formally defrocked in 1987. Eight of Kiesle's victims settled with the Diocese in 2005 for between $1 million and $1.5 million each, part of a total of $56 million in settlements paid out by the Diocese that year to those who had been abused, and more than a quarter of a million in therapy for victims. Diocese-owned insurance policies covered some 57% of these payments. Kiesle was sentenced to six years in prison; some of the charges were dropped because they were beyond the legal statute of limitations. He was returned to prison for four months for possessing pornography in violation of his parole. In October 2008, Bishop Allen Henry Vigneron opened a Healing Garden at the Cathedral of Christ the Light, dedicated to victims of clergy sexual abuse. From 1994 through 2009, the diocese paid $60.5 million to its victims of sexual abuse. In April 2012, the Catholic News Agency (CNA), in an online news story article with EWTN News, stated that the California Supreme Court, in an opinion written by California's Chief Justice, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, ruled that a one-year extension that had run out on the expired statute of limitations prevented six brothers of the Quarry family from suing the archdiocese over early 1970s molestation cases, in which the defendant was removed from the priesthood (1990s) and is deceased (2010), given that the claim is now too stale to be adequately defended against because of degradation in evidence.

The species was first described by Oldfield Thomas as Peregale leucura in 1887 from a single specimen from a collection of mammals of the British Museum. Reaching the size of a young rabbit, this species lived in the deserts of Central Australia. Since the 1950s‚Äì1960s, it has been believed to be extinct. Taxonomy A description of the species by Oldfield Thomas was published in 1887, using a specimen forwarded to the British Museum \\"J. Beazley\\" of Adelaide, collected at an unknown location; the author determined that the source of the specimen was from the Northern Territory or the vicinity of the southern city of Adelaide. Oldfield Thomas recognized an affinity with the \\"rabbit-bandicoot\\" Macrotis lagotis, then described by the genus Peragale, but found distinctions in the specimens that described a new species. Several later descriptions are synonymous with this species, H. H. Finlayson proposed a new subspecies as Thalacomys minor miseliusin 1932, based on specimens collected at the lower Diamantina, at Cooncherie, and acknowledged the description of Peragale minor by Baldwin Spencer in 1897, also recognised as a synonym. The treatment of the genus was again reviewed by Finlayson in 1935. The names for the species include white-tailed bilby. Description Illustration of a lesser bilby The lesser bilby was a medium- sized marsupial with a body mass of 300‚Äì435 grams, a combined head-body length of 200‚Äì270 millimetres and tail from 120 to 170 mm. Its fur colour ranged from pale yellowish-brown to grey-brown with pale white or yellowish-white fur on its belly, with white limbs and tail. The tail of this animal was long, about 70% of its total head-body length. Macrotis have long fur with a silky texture, the species have long tails and mobile ears that resemble those of a common rabbit (lagomorphs); they are burrowing animals that have long and narrow muzzles. The overall coloration of this species was more subdued than the bilby, Macrotis lagotis, and smaller in size; the shorter ears of M. leucura measured 63 mm from base to tip. The underside of the tail had a greyish patch at the base, but the long and bushy fur is otherwise white. An illustration reconstructing the animal in its native setting was painted by Peter Schouten. Distribution and habitat Very little is known about its former range and distribution, as the species was collected only six times in modern history, with the first of these coming from an unknown region. In modern times this species was endemic to the Gibson and Great Sandy deserts of arid central Australia and northeast South Australia and adjoining southeast Northern Territory in the northern half of the Lake Eyre Basin. It preferred to live in sandy and loamy deserts, spinifex sandplains and dunes, dominated by monuds of tough and grassy Triodia species with mulga Acacia aneura, zygochloa canegrass , or in Triodia hummock grassland with occasional low trees and shrubs. Ecology and behaviour The lesser bilby, like its surviving relatives, was a strictly nocturnal animal. It was an omnivore feeding on ants, termites, roots, seeds, but it also hunted and fed on introduced rodents. It burrowed in dunes, constructing burrows deep and closing the entrance with loose sand by day. It is suggested that it may have bred non-seasonally and that giving birth to twins was normal for this species. Unlike its living relative the greater bilby, the lesser bilby was described as aggressive and tenacious. Hedley Finlayson wrote that this animal was \\"fierce and intractable, and repulsed the most tactful attempts to handle them by repeated savage snapping bites and harsh hissing sounds\\". A collector in the northern territory reported the name used by his Aboriginal informants, Urpila, that distinguished this species from M. lagotis (Urgata), and noted their particular habits. This species would not reside in the deep and narrow part of its burrow in cooler seasons, remaining a short distance from the entrance; this habit was exploited by hunters who would collapse the tunnel behind their prey to force it toward the soft sand covering the opening of the burrow. Extinction spinifex-covered landscape of the Gibson Desert was the native habitat of the lesser bilby. Since its discovery in 1887, the species was rarely seen or collected and remained relatively unknown to science. In 1931, Finlayson encountered many of them near Cooncherie Station, collecting 12 live specimens. Although according to Finlayson this animal was abundant in that area, these were the last lesser bilbies to be collected alive. A single specimen collected to the north of Charlotte Waters was deposited at the museum in Melbourne and examined by Balwin Spencer in 1897, not recognizing it as this species. The collector of Spencer's animal, Patrick Michael Byrne, obtained the specimens with some difficulty. The last specimen ever found was a skull picked up below a wedge-tailed eagle's nest in 1967 at Steele Gap in the Simpson Desert, Northern Territory. The bones were estimated as being under 15 years old. Indigenous Australian oral tradition suggests that this species may have possibly survived into the 1960s. The decline in numbers of the lesser bilby and ultimately its extinction was attributed to several different factors. The introductions of foreign predators like the domestic cat and fox, being hunted for food by Indigenous Australians, competition with rabbits for food, changes in the fire regime and the degradation of habitat have all been blamed for the extinction of this species. However, Jane Thornback and Martin Jenkins suggested in their book that the vegetation in the main part of its range remained intact, with little evidence of cattle or rabbit grazing and point to cats and foxes as the most likely cause of the extinction of the lesser bilby.

It is called beveling when the angled cut is done on the side, although the resulting joint is still a mitre joint. For woodworking, a disadvantage of a mitre joint is its weakness, but it can be strengthened with a spline (a thin wafer of wood inserted into a slot, usually arranged with the long grain of the spline across the short grain of the frame timber). There are two common variations of a splined mitre joint, one where the spline is long and runs the length of the mating surfaces and another where the spline is perpendicular to the joined edges. Common applications include picture frames, pipes, and molding. Non-perpendicular joints For mitre joints occurring at angles other than 90¬∞, for materials of the same cross-section the proper cut angle must be determined so that the two pieces to be joined meet flush (i.e. one piece's mitered end is not longer than the adjoining piece). To find the cut angle divide the angle at which the two pieces meet by two. Technically, two different cut angles are required; one for each piece, where the second angle is 90¬∞ plus the aforementioned cut angle, but due to angular limitations in common cutting implements (hand circular saws, table saws) a single angle is required and is used to cut the first piece in one direction and the second piece in the opposite direction. Three-dimensional joints When a piece is beveled at both ends, such that the two attached pieces do not lie in the same plane, a three-dimensional structure is obtained. In that case, it is also necessary either to rotate the piece in its longitudinal axis, or, to tilt the saw blade before beveling the second end. When employing the miter joint to connect two pieces that have a non-circular cross-section it typically is desirable to have the longitudinal edges of the joined pieces match up properly at the joint. It is always possible to close a planar structure constructed with pieces having non- circular cross section into a loop through properly matched miter joints (e.g. a picture frame), however, a three-dimensional loop from pieces with non- circular cross section need not close properly when attempting to miter it all the way around. In general, a twist occurs, causing the edges at the last joint to be misaligned.

Bly (1998) refines the definition to ‚Äúa system which combines the interests of the scientific community at large with those of the computer science and engineering community to create integrated, tool-oriented computing and communication systems to support scientific collaboration‚Äù (Bly, 1998, p. 31). Rosenberg (1991) considers a collaboratory as being an experimental and empirical research environment in which scientists work and communicate with each other to design systems, participate in collaborative science, and conduct experiments to evaluate and improve systems. A simplified form of these definitions would describe the collaboratory as being an environment where participants make use of computing and communication technologies to access shared instruments and data, as well as to communicate with others. However, a wide-ranging definition is provided by Cogburn (2003) who states that ‚Äúa collaboratory is more than an elaborate collection of information and communications technologies; it is a new networked organizational form that also includes social processes; collaboration techniques; formal and informal communication; and agreement on norms, principles, values, and rules‚Äù (Cogburn, 2003, p. 86). This concept has a lot in common with the notions of Interlock research, Information Routing Group and Interlock diagrams introduced in 1984. Other meaning The word ‚Äúcollaboratory‚Äù is also used to describe an open space, creative process where a group of people work together to generate solutions to complex problems. This meaning of the word originates from the visioning work of a large group of people ‚Äì including scholars, artists, consultant, students, activists, and other professionals ‚Äì who worked together on the 50+20 initiative aiming at transforming management education. In this context, by fusing two elements, ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù and ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù, the word ‚Äúcollaboratory‚Äù suggests the construction of a space where people explore collaborative innovations. It is, as defined by Dr. Katrin Muff, ‚Äúan open space for all stakeholders where action learning and action research join forces, and students, educators, and researchers work with members of all facets of society to address current dilemmas.‚Äù The concept of the collaboratory as a creative group process and its application are further developed in the book ‚ÄúThe Collaboratory: A co-creative stakeholder engagement process for solving complex problems‚Äù. Examples of collaboratory events are provided on the website of the Collaboratory community as well as by Business School Lausanne- a Swiss business school that has adopted the collaboratory method to harness collective intelligence.  Background  Problems of geographic separation are especially present in large research projects. The time and cost for traveling, the difficulties in keeping contact with other scientists, the control of experimental apparatus, the distribution of information, and the large number of participants in a research project are just a few of the issues researchers are faced with. Therefore, collaboratories have been put into operation in response to these concerns and restrictions. However, the development and implementation proves to be not so inexpensive. From 1992 to 2000 financial budgets for scientific research and development of collaboratories ranged from US$447,000 to US$10,890,000 and the total use ranged from 17 to 215 users per collaboratory (Sonnenwald, 2003). Particularly higher costs occurred when software packages were not available for purchase and direct integration into the collaboratory or when requirements and expectations were not met. Chin and Lansing (2004) state that the research and development of scientific collaboratories had, thus far, a tool-centric approach. The main goal was to provide tools for shared access and manipulation of specific software systems or scientific instruments. Such an emphasis on tools was necessary in the early development years of scientific collaboratories due to the lack of basic collaboration tools (e.g. text chat, synchronous audio or videoconferencing) to support rudimentary levels of communication and interaction. Today, however, such tools are available in off-the-shelf software packages such as Microsoft NetMeeting, IBM Lotus Sametime, Mbone Videoconferencing (Chin and Lansing, 2004). Therefore, the design of collaboratories may now move beyond developing general communication mechanisms to evaluating and supporting the very nature of collaboration in the scientific context (Chin & Lansing, 2004). =The evolution of the collaboratory= As stated in Chapter 4 of the 50+20 \\"Management Education for the World\\" book, \\"the term collaboratory was first introduced in the late 1980s to address problems of geographic separation in large research projects related to travel time and cost, difficulties in keeping contact with other scientists, control of experimental apparatus, distribution of information, and the large number of participants. In their first decade of use, collaboratories were seen as complex and expensive information and communication technology (ICT) solutions supporting 15 to 200 users per project, with budgets ranging from 0.5 to 10 million USD. At that time, collaboratories were designed from an ICT perspective to serve the interests of the scientific community with tool-oriented computing requirements, creating an environment that enabled systems design and participation in collaborative science and experiments. The introduction of a user-centered approach provided a first evolutionary step in the design philosophy of the collaboratory, allowing rapid prototyping and development circles. Over the past decade the concept of the collaboratory expanded beyond that of an elaborate ICT solution, evolving into a ‚Äúnew networked organizational form that also includes social processes, collaboration techniques, formal and informal communication, and agreement on norms, principles, values, and rules‚Äù. The collaboratory shifted from being a tool- centric to a data-centric approach, enabling data sharing beyond a common repository for storing and retrieving shared data sets. These developments have led to the evolution of the collaboratory towards a globally distributed knowledge work that produces intangible goods and services capable of being both developed and distributed around the world using traditional ICT networks. Initially, the collaboratory was used in scientific research projects with variable degrees of success. In recent years, collaboratory models have been applied to areas beyond scientific research and the national context. The wide acceptance of collaborative technologies in many parts of the world opens promising opportunities for international cooperation in critical areas where societal stakeholders are unable to work out solutions in isolation, providing a platform for large multidisciplinary teams to work on complex global challenges. The emergence of open-source technology transformed the collaboratory into its next evolution. The term open-source was adopted by a group of people in the free software movement in Palo Alto in 1998 in reaction to the source code release of the Netscape Navigator browser. Beyond providing a pragmatic methodology for free distribution and access to an end product's design and implementation details, open-source represents a paradigm shift in the philosophy of collaboration. The collaboratory has proven to be a viable solution for the creation of a virtual organization. Increasingly, however, there is a need to expand this virtual space into the real world. We propose another paradigm shift, moving the collaboratory beyond its existing ICT framework to a methodology of collaboration beyond the tool- and data- centric approaches, and towards an issue-centered approach that is transdisciplinary in nature.\\" =The Collaboratory as a creative group process= Copyright 50+20 \\"Management Education for the World\\" book \\"Translating the concept of the collaboratory from the virtual space into a real environment demands a number of significant adjustments, leading us to yet another evolution. While the virtual collaboratory could count on ICT solutions to create and maintain an environment of collaboration, real-life interactions require facilitation experts to create and hold a space for members of the community, jointly developing transdisciplinary solutions around issues of concern. The ability to hold a space is central to the vision of management education. The technology involved with holding a space implies the ability to create and maintain a powerful and safe learning platform. Such a space invites the whole person (mind, heart, soul and hands) into a place where the potential of a situation is fully realized. Holding a space is deeply grounded in our human heritage, and is still considered an important duty of the elders amongst many indigenous peoples. In Western society, good coaches fulfill a similar role, including the ability to be present in the moment, listening with all senses, being attuned to the invisible potential about to be expressed. As a result, what needs to happen, will happen. Facilitation and coaching experts understand the specific challenges involved in setting up an environment in which a great number of people can meet to discuss solutions that none of them could develop individually. Coaching and facilitation solutions already exist to create and hold such spaces, but are nevertheless distinctly different in a felt sense from the ICT-driven virtual collaboratories we have seen over the past two decades. The evolution from the virtual collaboratory bears its own challenges and opportunities. In the co- creative process of the 50+20 vision, we learned to appreciate the power of the collaboratory both in real-life retreats as well as interactions between our gatherings. We propose that the next evolutionary step of the collaboratory will include both the broader community of researchers engaged in collaboratories around the world, as well as stakeholders in management education who seek to transform themselves by providing responsible leadership. In our new definition, a collaboratory is an inclusive learning environment where action learning and action research meet. It involves the active collaboration of a diversified group of participants that bring in different perspectives on a given issue or topic. In such a space, learning and research is organized around issues rather than disciplines or theory. Such issues include: hunger, energy, water, climate change, migration, democracy, capitalism, terrorism, disease, the financial crisis, new economic models, management education that serves the world and similarly pressing matters. These issues are usually complex, messy and hard to resolve, demanding creative, systemic and divergent approaches. The collaboratory's primary aim is to foster collective creativity. Participants in the collaboratory process The collaboratory is a place where people can think, work, learn together, and invent their respective futures. Its facilitators are highly experienced coaches who act as lead learners and guardians of the collaboratory space. They see themselves as transient gatekeepers of a world in need of new solutions. Subject experts are responsible for providing relevant knowledge and contributing it to the discussion in a relevant and pertinent matter. Students will continue to acquire subject knowledge outside the collaboratories ‚Äì both through traditional and developing channels (such as online or blended learning). As such, the faculty (of a business school, note added by the editor) is challenged to develop their capacities as facilitators and coaches in order to effectively guide these collaborative learning and research processes. To do this, they must step back from their role as experts and rather serve as facilitators in an open, participative and creative process. Faculty training and development needs to include not only a broad understanding of global issues, but also the development of facilitation and coaching skills. The circular space of the collaboratory can become the preferred meeting place for citizens to jointly question, discuss and construct new ideas and approaches to resolve environmental, societal and economic challenges on both a regional and global level. Collaboratories should always reflect a rich combination of stakeholders: coaches, business and management faculty, citizens, politicians, entrepreneurs, people from different regions and cultures, youth and elders. Together they assemble differences in perspective, expertise and personal backgrounds, thereby adding a vital creative edge to every encounter, negotiation or problem-solving session.\\"  Characteristics and considerations  A distinctive characteristic of collaboratories is that they focus on data collection and analysis. Hence the interest to apply collaborative technologies to support data sharing as opposed to tool sharing. Chin and Lansing (2004) explore the shift of collaboratory development from traditional tool-centric approaches to more data-centric ones, to effectively support data sharing. This means more than just providing a common repository for storing and retrieving shared data sets. Collaboration, Chin and Lansing (2004) state, is driven both by the need to share data and to share knowledge about data. Shared data is only useful if sufficient context is provided about the data such that collaborators may comprehend and effectively apply it. It is therefore imperative, according to Chin and Lansing (2004), to know and understand how data sets relate to aspects of overall data space, applications, experiments, projects, and the scientific community, identifying the critical features or properties among which we can mention: * General data set properties (owner, creation data, size, format); * Experimental properties (conditions of the scientific experiment that generated that data); * Data provenance (relationship with previous versions); * Integration (relationship of data subsets within the full data set); * Analysis and interpretation (notes, experiences, interpretations, and knowledge produced) * Scientific organization (scientific classification or hierarchy); * Task (research task that generated or applies the data set); * Experimental process (relationship of data and tasks to the overall process); * User community (application of data set to different users). Henline (1998) argues that communication about experimental data is another important characteristic of a collaboratory. By focusing attention on the dynamics of information exchange, the study of Zebrafish Information Network Project (Henline, 1998) concluded that the key challenges in creating a collaboratory may be social rather than technical. ‚ÄúA successful system must respect existing social conventions while encouraging the development of analogous mechanisms within the new electronic forum‚Äù (Henline, 1998, p. 69). Similar observations were made in the Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) case study (Cogburn, 2003). The author (Cogburn, 2003) is investigating a collaboratory established for researchers in education and other related domains from United States of America and southern Africa. The main finding was that there have been important intellectual contributions on both sides, although the context was that of a developed country working together with a developing one and there have been social as well as cultural barriers. He further develops the idea that a successful CSCL would need to draw the best lessons learned on both sides in computer-mediated communication (CMC) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). Sonnenwald (2003) conducted seventeen interviews with scientists and revealed important considerations. Scientists expect a collaboratory to ‚Äúsupport their strategic plans; facilitate management of the scientific process; have a positive or neutral impact on scientific outcomes; provide advantages and disadvantages for scientific task execution; and provide personal conveniences when collaborating across distances‚Äù (Sonnenwald, 2003, p. 68). Many scientists looked at the collaboratory as means to achieve strategic goals that were organizational and personal in nature. Other scientists anticipated that the scientific process would speed up when they had access to the collaboratory. Design philosophy Finholt (1995), based on the case studies of the Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory (UARC) and the Medical Collaboratory, establishes a design philosophy: a collaboratory project must be dedicated to a user-centered design (UCD) approach. This means a commitment to develop software in programming environments that allow rapid prototyping, rapid development cycles (Finholt, 1995). A consequence of the user-centered design in the collaboratory is that the system developers must be able to distinguish when a particular system or modification has positive impact on users‚Äô work practices. An important part of obtaining this understanding is producing an accurate picture of how work is done prior to the introduction of technology. Finholt (1995) explains that behavioral scientists had the task of understanding the actual work settings for which new information technologies were developed. The goal of a user-centered design effort was to inject those observations back into the design process to provide a baseline for evaluating future changes and to illuminate productive directions for prototype development (Finholt, 1995). A similar viewpoint is expressed by Cogburn (2003) who relates the collaboratory to a globally distributed knowledge work, stating that human-computer interaction (HCI) and user-centered design (UCD) principles are critical for organizations to take advantage of the opportunities of globalization and the emergence of an Information society. He (Cogburn, 2003) refers to distributed knowledge work as being a set of ‚Äúeconomic activities that produce intangible goods and services [‚Ä¶], capable of being both developed and distributed around the world using the global information and communication networks‚Äù (Cogburn, 2003, p. 81). Through the use of these global information and communications networks, organizations are able to take part in globally disarticulated production, which means they can locate their research and development facilities almost anywhere in the world, and engineers can collaborate across time zones, institutions and national boundaries.  Evaluation  Meeting expectations is a factor that influences adoption of innovations, including scientific collaboratories. Some of the collaboratories implemented thus far have not been entirely successful. The Mathematics and Computer Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory, Waterfall Glen collaboratory (Henline, 1998) is an illustrative example. This collaboratory had its shares of problems. There have been the occasional technical and social disasters, but most importantly it did not meet all of the collaboration and interaction requirements. The vast majority of the evaluations performed thus far are concentrating mainly on the usage statistics (e.g. total number of members, hours of use, amount of data communicated) or on the immediate role in the production of traditional scientific outcomes (e.g. publications and patents). Sonnenwald (2003), however, argues that we should rather look for longer-term and intangible measures such as new and continued relationship among scientists, and subsequent, longer-term creation of new knowledge. Regardless of the criteria used for evaluation, we must focus on understanding the expectations and requirements defined for a collaboratory. Without such understanding a collaboratory runs the risk of not being adopted.  Success factors  Olson, Teasley, Bietz, and Cogburn (2002) ascertain some of the success factors of a collaboratory. They are: collaboration readiness, collaboration infrastructure readiness, and collaboration technology readiness. Collaboration readiness is the most basic pre-requisite for an effective collaboratory, according to Olson, Teasley, Bietz, and Cogburn (2002). Often the critical component to collaboration readiness is based on the concept of ‚Äúworking together in order to achieve a science goal‚Äù (Olson, Teasley, Bietz, & Cogburn, 2002, p. 46). Incentives to collaborate, shared principles of collaboration, and experience with the elements of collaboration are also crucial. Successful interaction between users requires a certain amount of common ground. Interactions require a high degree of trust or negotiation, especially when they involve areas where there is a cultural difference. ‚ÄúEthical norms tend to be culturally specific, and negotiations about ethical issues require high levels of trust‚Äù (Olson, Teasley, Bietz, & Cogburn, 2002, p. 49). When analyzing the collaboration infrastructure readiness Olson, Teasley, Bietz, and Cogburn (2002) state that modern collaboration tools require adequate infrastructure to operate properly. Many off-the-shelf applications will run effectively only on state-of-the-art workstations. An important piece of the infrastructure is the technical support necessary to ensure version control, to get participants registered, and to recover in case of disaster. Communications cost is another element which can be critical for collaboration infrastructure readiness (Olson, Teasley, Bietz, & Cogburn, 2002). Pricing structures for network connectivity can affect the choices that users will make and therefore have an effect on the collaboratory's final design and implementation. Collaboration technology readiness, according to Olson, Teasley, Bietz, and Cogburn (2002), refers to the fact that collaboration does not involve only technology and infrastructure, but also requires a considerable investment in training. Thus, it is essential to assess the state of technology readiness in the community to ensure success. If the level is too primitive more training is required to bring the users‚Äô knowledge up-to-date.  Examples  Biological Sciences Collaboratory = The Biological Sciences Collaboratory ‚Äî provides an integrated set of tools, allowing researchers to share data, applications, and communications A comprehensively described example of a collaboratory, the Biological Sciences Collaboratory (BSC) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Chin & Lansing, 2004), enables the sharing and analysis of biological data through metadata capture, electronic laboratory notebooks, data organization views, data provenance tracking, analysis notes, task management, and scientific workflow management. BSC supports various data formats, has data translation capabilities, and can interact and exchange data with other sources (external databases, for example). It offers subscription capabilities (to allow certain individuals to access data) and verification of identities, establishes and manages permissions and privileges, and has data encryption capabilities (to ensure secure data transmission) as part of its security package. Through data provenance, data sets may be traced back to their original sourcesBSC also provides a data provenance tool and a data organization tool. These tools allow a hierarchical tree to display the historical lineage of a data set. From this tree-view the scientist may select a particular node (or an entire branch) to access a specific version of the data set (Chin & Lansing, 2004). The task management provided by BSC allows users to define and track tasks related to a specific experiment or project. Tasks can have deadlines assigned, levels of priority, and dependencies. Tasks can also be queried and various reports produced. Related to task management, BSC provides workflow management to capture, manage, and supply standard paths of analyses. The scientific workflow may be viewed as process templates that captures and semi-automate the steps of an analysis process and its encompassing data sets and tools (Chin & Lansing, 2004). BSC provides project collaboration by allowing scientists to define and manage members of their group. Security and authentication mechanisms are therefore applied to limit access to project data and applications. Monitoring capability allows for members to identify other members that are online working on the project (Chin & Lansing, 2004). BSC offers community collaboration capabilities: scientists may publish their data sets to a larger community through the data portal. Notifications are in place for scientists interested in a particular set of data - when that data changes, the scientists get notification via email (Chin & Lansing, 2004). = Collaboratory for Adaptation to Climate Change = The Collaboratory for Adaptation to Climate Change is an interdisciplinary project funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Office of CyberInfrastructure and supported by the University of Notre Dame. The research mission of the Collaboratory is to improve the dissemination and integration of knowledge that will inform the development of prescient adaptation strategies and policies. Goals of the Collaboratory include: * Facilitating interactions among researchers and decision makers. * Providing a vibrant online medium that converts data into knowledge. * Enabling users to run simulations and visualize future scenarios. * Providing access to expert opinion as measured via repeated, national surveys. * Building an information clearinghouse of legal data and regulatory information about adaptation to climate change. The Collaboratory is not a place for political debate, but is a place for pitching ideas and information with legitimate scientific backing that inform adaptation decisions. The website is a resource for research, education, and collaboration in the area of adaptation and climate change. It incorporates a multitude of tools, which take several forms including biological simulation, searchable clearinghouses of legal information, and dissemination of emerging opinion from experts on the benefits and risks of adaptation. These tools can be used individually and in an integrative way to inform decision-making, research, and awareness. The site was created in April 2011 and is under continual development. Check back often for new additions and improvements. Adaptation, together with reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, is an essential part of solving the climate change crisis. Adaptation includes all of the steps that humans might take to help reduce the effects of climate change that are projected to occur in the 21st century and beyond. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and international body of scientists, projects that the global climate is likely to shift 2‚Äì6 ¬∞C (4‚Äì11 ¬∞F) warmer within 100 years. That amount of warming will disrupt ecosystems, raise sea levels, and perturb agriculture and human infrastructure. It also will affect human health. We can take steps now to reduce these effects in some instances and places. Adaptation includes, for example, helping species relocate to newly-suitable locations, protecting shores from rising waters and contoling pests that increase or spread under altered conditions. In 2011, Adapt is focused on adaptation for wildlife and biological resources. We welcome scientists, natural resource managers and planners, students and the interested public to participate.Take a tour of our web site and see how you can use our infrastructure to further your own research and educational activities.

The main goal of DCC was to make the information exchange for the combustion researchers more efficient. Researchers would collaborate over the Internet using various DCC tools. These tools included ‚Äúa distributed execution management system for running combustion models on widely distributed computers (distributed computing), including supercomputers; web accessible data archiving capabilities for sharing graphical experimental or modeling data; electronic notebooks and shared workspaces for facilitating collaboration; visualization of combustion data; and videoconferencing and data conferencing among researchers at remote sites‚Äù (Pancerella, Rahn, & Yang, 1999, p. 1). The collaboratory design team defined the requirements to be (Pancerella, Rahn, & Yang, 1999): * Ability share graphical data easily; * Ability to discuss modeling strategies and exchange model descriptions; * Archiving collaborative information; * Ability to run combustion models at widely separated locations; * Ability to analyze experimental data and modeling results in a web- accessible format; * Videoconference and group meetings capabilities. Each of these requirements had to be done securely and efficiently across the Internet. Resources availability was a major concern because many of the chemistry simulations could run for hours or even days on high-end workstations and produce Kilobytes to Megabytes of data sets. These data sets had to be visualized using simultaneous 2-D plots of multiple variables (Pancerella, Rahn, & Yang, 1999). The deployment of the DCC was done in a phased approach. The first phase was based on iterative development, testing, and deployment of individual collaboratory tools. Once collaboratory team members had adequately tested each new tool, it was deployed to combustion researchers. The deployment of the infrastructure (videoconferencing tools, multicast routing capabilities, and data archives) was done in parallel (Pancerella, Rahn, & Yang, 1999). The next phase was to implement full security in the collaboratory. The primary focus was on two-way synchronous and multi-way asynchronous collaborations (Pancerella, Rahn, & Yang, 1999). The challenge was to balance the increased access to data that was needed with the security requirements. The final phase was the broadening of the target research to multiple projects including a broader range of collaborators. The collaboratory team found that the highest impact was perceived by the geographically separated scientists that truly depended on each other to achieve their goals. One of the team's major challenges was to overcome the technological and social barriers in order to meet all of the objectives (Pancerella, Rahn, & Yang, 1999). User openness and low maintenance security collaboratories are hard to achieve, therefore user feedback and evaluation are constantly required. = Other collaboratories = Other collaboratories that have been implemented and can be further investigated are: *Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) is an international center for research and education in biology, biomedicine and ecology. * Biological Collaborative Research Environment (BioCoRE) developed at University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign ‚Äì a collaboration tool for biologists (Chin and Lansing, 2004); * The CTQ Collaboratory, a virtual community of teacher leaders and those who value teacher leadership, run by the Center for Teaching Quality, a national education nonprofit (Berry, Byrd, & Wieder, 2013); * Molecular Interactive Collaborative Environment (MICE) developed at the San Diego Supercomputer Center ‚Äì provides collaborative access and manipulation of complex, three-dimensional molecular models as captured in various scientific visualization programs (Chin and Lansing, 2004); * Molecular Modeling Collaboratory (MMC) developed at University of California, San Francisco ‚Äì allows remote biologists to share and interactively manipulate three- dimensional molecular models in applications such as drug design and protein engineering (Chin and Lansing, 2004); * Collaboratory for Microscopic Digital Anatomy (CMDA) ‚Äì a computational environment to provide biomedical scientists remote access to a specialized research electron microscope (Henline, 1998); * The Collaboratory for Strategic Partnerships and Applied Research at Messiah College - an organization of Christian students, educators, and professionals affiliated with Messiah College, aspiring to fulfill Biblical mandates to foster justice, empower the poor, reconcile adversaries, and care for the earth, in the context of academic engagement. * Waterfall Glen ‚Äì a multi-user object-oriented (MOO) collaboratory at Argonne National Laboratory (Henline, 1998); * The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) ‚Äì a scientific collaboratory for the development of advanced measures of personality and other individual differences (Henline, 1998); * TANGO ‚Äì a set of collaborative applications for education and distance learning, command and control, health care, and computer steering (Henline, 1998). Special consideration should be attributed to TANGO (Henline, 1998) because it is a step forward in implementing collaboratories, as it has distance learning and health care as main domains of operation. Henline (1998) mentions that the collaboratory has been successfully used to implement applications for distance learning, command and control center, telemedical bridge, and a remote consulting tool suite. *Collaborative architecture and Interactive architecture, the work of Adam Somlai-Fischer and Usman Haque. *The Internet & Society Collaboratory supported by Google in Germany Summary  To date, most collaboratories have been applied largely in scientific research projects, with various degrees of success and failure. Recently, however, collaboratory models have been applied to additional areas of scientific research in both national and international contexts. As a result, a substantial knowledge base has emerged helping us in understanding their development and application in science and industry (Cogburn, 2003). Extending the collaboratory concept to include both social and behavioral research as well as more scientists from the developing world could potentially strengthen the concept and provide opportunities of learning more about the social and technical factors that support a distributed knowledge network (Cogburn, 2003). The use of collaborative technologies to support geographically distributed scientific research is gaining wide acceptance in many parts of the world. Such collaboratories hold great promise for international cooperation in critical areas of scientific research and not only. As the frontiers of knowledge are pushed back the problems get more and more difficult, often requiring large multidisciplinary teams to make progress. The collaboratory is emerging as a viable solution, using communication and computing technologies to relax the constraints of distance and time, creating an instance of a virtual organization. The collaboratory is both an opportunity with very useful properties, but also a challenge to human organizational practices (Olson, 2002).

Fryer completed his Ph.D. in economics from Penn State in 2002. He conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago with Nobel laureate economist Gary Becker. Fryer has collaborated with several other academics, including Steven Levitt, the University of Chicago economist and author of Freakonomics, Glenn Loury, a Brown University economist, and Edward Glaeser, an urban economist at Harvard. Upon completing a three-year fellowship with the Harvard Society of Fellows at the end of the 2005‚Äì2006 academic year, Fryer joined Harvard's economics department as an assistant professor. In 2005, Fryer was also selected as one of the first Fletcher Foundation Fellows.  Academic career  By 2005, Fryer was regarded as one of Black America's and Harvard's rising academic stars, in the aftermath of publishing numerous economics-related papers in prominent academic journals. In 2007, at age 30, he became the youngest African-American to ever receive tenure at Harvard (Noam Elkies was 26). In 2007, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg appointed Professor Fryer to be the New York City Department of Education's Chief Equality Officer. Professor Fryer both inspired and oversaw the Opportunity NYC project, which studied how students in low-performing schools respond to financial incentives, offering as much as $500 for \\"doing well on standardized tests and showing up for class.\\" In 2009, Fryer formed the Education Innovation Laboratory at Harvard University, and served as its Director until its closure ten years later, in 2019.Roland G. Fryer, Jr. is Professor of Economics at Harvard University and faculty director of the Education Innovation Laboratory (EdLabs). Archive.org (original site has been closed by Harvard University as of 2019). In 2011, he was named a MacArthur Fellow and received the 2015 John Bates Clark Medal. In 2016, Fryer published a working paper concluding that although minorities (African Americans and Hispanics) are more likely to experience police use of force than whites, they were not more likely to be shot by police than whites. The paper generated considerable controversy and criticism.Why it‚Äôs impossible to calculate the percentage of police shootings that are legitimate, Radley Balko, Washington Post, July 14, 2016 Fryer responded to some of these criticisms in an interview with The New York Times. In 2019, Fryer's paper was published in the Journal of Political Economy. Some scholars criticized Fryer's study, arguing that due to selection bias, he was unable to draw any conclusions about racial bias in shootings from police stops. If police are more likely to stop a black person than a white person, then the average white person that they stop might be dissimilar to the average black person (for example, the white person might be behaving in a more threatening manner), thus leading to faulty inferences about racial bias in shootings. A 2020 study by Princeton University political scientists disputed the findings by Fryer, saying that if police had a higher threshold for stopping whites, this might mean that the whites, Hispanics and blacks in Fryer's data are not similar. Nobel-laureate James Heckman and Steven Durlauf, both University of Chicago economists, published a response to the Fryer study, writing that the paper \\"does not establish credible evidence on the presence or absence of discrimination against African Americans in police shootings\\" due to issues with selection bias.. Fryer responded saying Durlauf and Heckman erroneously claim that his sample is \\"based on stops\\". Further, he states that the \\"vast majority of the data...is gleaned from 911 calls for service in which a civilian requests police presence.\\". Fryer is a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a member of the NBER Economics of Education (EE) and Labor Studies (LS) programs.https://admin.nber.org/people/roland_fryer =Suspension from Harvard= In March 2018, Harvard barred Fryer from his research lab, the Education Innovation Laboratory (EdLabs), upon launching an investigation into Title IX complaints against him alleging sexual harassment. Fryer alleged that he was \\"unfairly scrutinized ... for his skin color.\\" Harvard confirmed that its Office for Dispute Resolution received complaints against Fryer in January, March, and April 2018. In December 2018, Fryer resigned from the executive committee of the American Economic Association, to which he had been elected (but had not yet taken up his seat); Fryer submitted his resignation after coming under pressure from fellow economists to step down due to the sexual harassment allegations against him. In a letter to The New York Times later that month, Fryer expressed regret for having \\"allowed, encouraged and participated\\" an atmosphere at EdLabs that included \\"off-color jokes\\" and comments about personal lives, but denied bullying, retaliating against employees, or making sexual advances to any employee. Harvard's investigation concluded that Fryer had \\"engaged in unwanted sexual conduct toward several individuals\\" and \\"exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet expectations of conduct within our community and was harmful to the well-being of its members.\\" In July 2019, Fryer was suspended from the Harvard faculty for two years without pay, a disciplinary action determined by a panel of tenured faculty. Harvard also determined that, after returning from suspension, Fryer cannot be an adviser or supervisor, have access to graduate fellows, or teach graduate workshops, but can teach graduate classes. Fryer had been one of Harvard's most highly paid professors. As the sanctions took effect, Harvard permanently closed EdLabs in September 2019.

It comprises the counties of Siskiyou, Modoc, Trinity, Shasta, Lassen, Tehama, Plumas, Glenn, Butte, Sierra, Colusa, Sutter, Yuba, Nevada, Yolo, Placer, Solano, Sacramento, El Dorado, and Amador, and is headquartered in Sacramento, California. Also known as the See of Sacramento, it is led by a bishop who pastors the mother church of the diocese, the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Originally a major part of the defunct Grass Valley Diocese (which included several counties in northern California and Nevada), the present-day diocese was established by Pope Leo XIII on May 28, 1886. Today, the See of Sacramento remains a ceremonial suffragan of the ecclesiastical province of the Archdiocese of San Francisco. Its fellow suffragans include the Dioceses of Honolulu, Las Vegas, Oakland, Reno, Salt Lake City, San Jose, Santa Rosa and Stockton. The current Bishop of Sacramento is Jaime Soto, who was named coadjutor in October 2007 and succeeded Bishop William Weigand on Sunday November 30, 2008.

The Valkyrie Gudra actually steals the soul of one of them, the explosive hero known as TNT. It was soon after this that Tsunami defects; she was then replaced with Kamikaze. During an intense battle, Die Fledermaus is slain by Fury while she is affected by the god Tisiphone. The Axis suffer a major defeat but return. The All-Stars are aided in this second fight by a similar group of heroes known as The Allies. This team consists of Fireball, Kuei, Phantasmo, and the Squire.

DC Comics. =Modern Age team= This team was an updated version of the old team and was created by Manson and his Clockwatchers organization; they have no relation to the original Axis Amerika. Axis America was a secret fascist cult who ran a children's home called Safe Haven. The JLA arrived to mediate between governmental forces and what they believed to be the innocent men and women inside the camp. Manson manipulated Faith, his former servant, causing her powers to go out of control. It seemed, to the public at large, that the JLA had killed thousands of innocent people. Superman is imprisoned for the destruction of Safe Haven. Faith goes to Manson, promising to work for him if the JLA's name is cleared.

Since the handover, the constitutional framework is provided by the Hong Kong Basic Law, which is a national law of the PRC and has constitutional status in Hong Kong. Under one country, two systems, Hong Kong mostly preserved its own legal system developed under British rule, distinct from Mainland China. The Hong Kong legal system is a common law one, based on a combination of English common law (developed also in local cases) and local legislation codified in the Laws of Hong Kong. In comparison, the PRC has a civil law system with socialist roots. Only a small number of PRC laws directly apply in Hong Kong by virtue of stipulations in Article 18 and Annex III of the Basic Law. The separation of the Hong Kong legal system from the PRC is guaranteed by the Basic Law until at least 2047. The Hong Kong judiciary has had a long-standing reputation for fairness and was rated as the best judicial system in Asia by one survey in 2008.Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) survey; Hong Kong's judicial system scored 1.45 on the scale (zero representing the best performance and 10 the worst); Singapore with a grade of 1.92, followed by Japan (3.50), South Korea (4.62), Taiwan (4.93), the Philippines (6.10), Malaysia (6.47), India (6.50), Thailand (7.00), China (7.25), Vietnam's (8.10) and Indonesia (8.26). afp.google.com/article, Hong Kong has best judicial system in Asia: business survey ;www.abs-cbnnews.com, Hong Kong has best judicial system in Asia: business survey  History and the Basic Law  Hong Kong's legal system was developed under British governance, based on the English common law. Under British rule, the constitutional documents that governed Hong Kong were the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, and judicial cases were generally appealable to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the UK. In the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, the UK and the PRC mutually agreed that Hong Kong would be returned to China after 1997. Hong Kong would be governed by the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle, under which Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and way of life, including the legal system, would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years until 2047. The Hong Kong Basic Law, which is a law passed by the Chinese National People's Congress, came into effect in 1997, becoming the constitutional document in Hong Kong. The law was passed in accordance with Article 31 of the Chinese Constitution, which authorized the establishment of Special Administrative Regions. The Basic Law sets out the status of Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region of the PRC, the one country, two systems principle, the political structure of Hong Kong, and the rights of duties of Hong Kong residents.  Legal areas Administrative law = Administrative law in Hong Kong is heavily modelled on its counterpart in England and Wales, especially the law of judicial review. This applies both to the procedure and grounds of judicial review, though there is some divergence in various areas. Some aspects of administrative law, for example administrative tribunals, were originally modelled on their counterparts in England and Wales but have not been systematically reformed for decades. = Constitutional law = The Hong Kong Basic Law contains the essentials of the constitutional framework in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Article 8 stipulates that all laws in force before 1997, including > the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and > customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, > and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special > Administrative Region. Article 18 states, further, that national laws, from the People's Republic of China do not apply, except for a specific list in Annex III to the Basic Law, to which the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress can add or delete what it chooses. However, this may only be in the fields of \\"defence and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the Region as specified by this Law\\". It also has a derogation, in a war situation, for a state of emergency to be declared. Hence, the laws in force are in hierarchical order are The Hong Kong Basic Law; legislation in force before 1 July 1997 that was adopted as laws of the HKSAR by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; laws enacted by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong after 1997; and PRC laws listed in Annex III to the Basic Law and applied by way of promulgation or legislation; common law and equity; subordinate legislation; customary law. Currently, twelve PRC laws apply in the HKSAR. These national laws apply in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong legislature legislating on the same matter: for example, the Law of the People's Republic of China on the National Flag, a Chinese statute, takes effect in Hong Kong in form of the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance, a local statute enacted by the local legislature. The Basic Law contains provisions that offer protection for human rights. Any laws that contravene the Basic Law are unconstitutional and are of no effect. Hong Kong has a Bill of Rights Ordinance which is the local adaptation of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights. Laws have been passed to ensure the human rights protected in the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, such as the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Disability Discrimination Ordinance, Family Status Discrimination Ordinance, Sex Discrimination Ordinance and Race Discrimination Ordinance. =Criminal law Family law = Family law in Hong Kong is heavily modelled on its counterpart in England and Wales with important modifications. Ancillary relief Hong Kong does not have a statutory matrimonial property regime. There is no system of \\"community of property\\" and property rights are not in principle affected by marriage. Instead, the family courts have very broad discretion to make a range of financial orders upon a decree of divorce pursuant to the \\"Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance (Cap 192)\\", namely for: periodical payments, secured periodical payments, lump sum payments, transfers or sale of property, settlement of property (into a trust), and variation of settlements. Similarly, there are powers to make orders for maintenance pending suit once divorce proceedings have begun. These are interim measures that will end once the final divorce decree is granted. In making final financial orders in favour of a spouse, courts are guided by four principles: (i) the objective of fairness, (ii) rejection of discrimination, (iii) the yardstick of equal division, and (iv) rejection of minute retrospective investigation (see \\"LKW v DD\\" [2010] HKCFA 70; [2010] 6 HKC 528). They are also required to consider the following non- exhaustive list of factors (see section 7(1) of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance (Cap 192). Child custody The family courts have broad jurisdiction to deal with the welfare of children under the provisions of the \\"Guardianship of Minors Ordinance (Cap 13)\\", the \\"Separation and Maintenance Orders Ordinance (Cap 16)\\", the \\"Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap 179)\\" and the \\"Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance (Cap 192)\\". Additionally, the High Court's has broad powers under its inherent jurisdiction including wardship. In parental disputes, generally the courts are concerned with making orders for custody, care and control, and access. These orders are distinct from questions of financial responsibility for children (i.e. \\"maintenance\\"). Access is the right to have contact with the child, it may be unsupervised or supervised (i.e. where there are concerns about the impact of contact on the child); undefined (sometimes \\"reasonable\\" or \\"generous\\") or defined (i.e. at times specified in the order); staying (a.k.a. overnight) or \\"day-time\\". Care and control is the right to make day- to-day decisions about the child; it should not be confused with \\"shared care\\" and the notion of the primary caregiver. Custody is the right to make all important decisions affecting the child and it is generally awarded to one parent (\\"sole custody\\") or shared between both parents (\\"joint custody\\"): see \\"PD v KWW (Joint Custody, Care and Control)\\" [2010] 4 HKLRD 191; [2010] HKCA 172. The paramount consideration for the court is always the welfare (or \\"best interests\\") of the child; this is known as the Welfare Principle (see section 3 of Cap 13). In determining the best interests of the child, the court will generally have regard to the Welfare Checklist, i.e. the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of the child's age and understanding); the physical, emotional and educational needs of the child; the likely effect on the child of any change in the child's circumstances; the child's age, sex, background and any characteristics of the child's which the court considers relevant; any harm the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering; how capable each of the parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting the child's needs; the range of powers available to the court in the proceedings in question; and the general principle that any delay is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child: see \\"H v N [2012] 5 HKLRD 498; [2012] HKCFI 1533\\". Divorce The jurisdiction of the family courts to deal with divorce, separation and nullity of marriage is set out in the \\"Separation and Maintenance Orders Ordinance (Cap 16)\\" and the \\"Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap 179)\\". =Procedure and evidenceBusiness associations=Companies Registry The Companies Registry () is responsible for administering and enforcing the Companies Ordinance and several other related ordinances. Its primary functions include the incorporation of local companies; the registration of oversea companies; the registration of documents required to be submitted by registered companies; the deregistration of defunct, solvent private companies; the prosecution of companies and their officers for breaches of the various regulatory provisions of the Companies Ordinance; the provision of facilities to inspect and obtain company information; and advising the Government on policy and legislative issues regarding company law and related legislation, including the Overall Review of the Companies Ordinance. Official Receiver's Office When appointed by the court and creditors, the Official Receiver () is responsible for the proper and orderly administration of the estates of insolvent companies ordered to be wound up by the court under the winding-up provisions of the Companies Ordinance and of individuals or partners declared bankrupt by the court under the Bankruptcy Ordinance. =Labour lawProperty law=The Land Registry The Land Registry () administers the Land Registration Ordinance governing the system of land registration and provides facilities for search of the Land Register and related records by the public and government departments. It has responsibility for the registration of owners corporations under the Building Management Ordinance. Legal Advisory and Conveyancing Office The Legal Advisory and Conveyancing Office (LACO, Ê≥ïÂæãË´ÆË©¢ÂèäÁî∞ÂúüËΩâÊòìËôï) is part of the Lands Department. It provides legal advice primarily to the Lands Administration Office of the Lands Department and other government departments on land related matters and ordinances. LACO is responsible for drafting and settling government land disposal and lease modification documents. LACO is also responsible for the preparation of documentation relating to the acquisition of land from private owners pursuant to statutory powers and the payment of compensation to those owners. LACO administers the Lands Department Consent Scheme to approve applications by developers to sell flats in uncompleted developments. It also approves Deeds of Mutual Covenant requiring approval under land leases. LACO also provides conveyancing services to the Financial Secretary Incorporated for the extension of non-renewable leases, the Government Property Agency for the sale and purchase of government properties and the Secretary for Home Affairs Incorporated for the purchase of accommodation for welfare purposes in private developments. It handles applications for the apportionment of premium and government rents under the Government Rent and Premium (Apportionment) Ordinance. In addition, it is responsible for the recovery of arrears of government rents other than rents under the Government Rent (Assessment and Collection) Ordinance. Intellectual Property Department The Intellectual Property Department () serves as the focal point for intellectual property policy, law and acquisition and public education on intellectual property protection. It provides expert policy advice to the Commerce, Industry and Technology Bureau and legal advice to other government departments on intellectual property. It comments on draft intellectual property bills. It operates the registries of trade marks, patents and designs. It is also responsible for registration of copyright licensing bodies. * Hong Kong copyright law * Hong Kong trade mark law * Patent law in Hong Kong =ObligationsInternational co-operation= Under the Basic Law, the HKSAR has a high degree of autonomy in external affairs. With the authority of the Central People's Government where necessary, it has concluded more than a hundred bilateral agreements with other jurisdictions. In addition, over 200 multilateral international conventions are applicable to the HKSAR. Using the name \\"Hong Kong, China\\", the HKSAR also participates on its own as a full member in international organisations and conferences not limited to states, e.g. the World Trade Organization, the World Customs Organization, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, etc. As part of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, representatives of the HKSAR Government participate in activities of the Hague Conference, as well as of other international organisations and conferences limited to states, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. InstitutionsThe judiciary ()= Court of Final Appeal It is fundamental to Hong Kong's legal system that members of the judiciary are independent of the executive and legislative branches of government. The courts of justice in Hong Kong are the Court of Final Appeal, the High Court (which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance), the District Court (which includes the Family Court), the Lands Tribunal, the Magistrates' Court (which include the Juvenile Court), the Coroner's Court, the Labour Tribunal, the Small Claims Tribunal and the Obscene Articles Tribunal. =Department of Justice ()= The Department of Justice (DOJ) It consists of five professional divisions responsible for legal work. It is headed by the Secretary for Justice, who is a member of the Executive Council and is the Government's chief legal adviser. He has ultimate responsibility for the prosecution of all offences in the HKSAR. * The Legal Policy Division, as well as the Secretary for Justice's Office, provides professional support to the Secretary for Justice in the execution of her duties and provides input on all legal policy issues being considered by the Government. The division advises on issues relating to the administration of justice, the legal system, the legal profession, human rights, the Basic Law and the law of Mainland China. The Law Reform Commission Secretariat, which provides research and secretarial support to The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong, is within the division. * The Civil Division provides legal advice to the Government on civil law, drafts commercial contracts and franchises and conducts civil litigation, arbitration and mediation on behalf of the Government. * The Law Drafting Division is responsible for drafting all legislation, including subsidiary legislation, in Chinese and English, and assists in steering legislation through the Executive and Legislative Councils. It also has editorial responsibility for the Laws of Hong Kong and for maintaining an up-to-date version of those laws in the Bilingual Laws Information System, a computer database which is available free to the public on the Internet. * The Prosecutions Division, headed by the Director of Public Prosecution, prosecutes trials and appeals on behalf of the HKSAR and generally exercises the Secretary for Justice's discretion whether or not to bring criminal proceedings against a person. It conducts most criminal appeals up to and including the Court of Final Appeal. It also conduct the majority of trials in the Court of First Instance and the District Court and, when necessary, it prosecutes in the Magistrates‚Äô Court. The division also provides legal advice to law enforcement agencies and other government departments on the criminal law aspects of any proposed legislation. * The International Law Division advises the Government on issues relating to public international law. Lawyers in this division also participate in the negotiation of agreements with other jurisdictions and handle requests to and from the HKSAR for international legal co-operation. =Law Reform Commission ()= The Law Reform Commission considers and reports on such topics as may be referred to it by the Secretary for Justice or the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR. Its membership includes academics, practising lawyers and prominent community members. The commission has published reports covering subjects as diverse as commercial arbitration, data protection, divorce, sale of goods and supply of services, insolvency, fraud and statutory interpretation. The recommendations in many of its reports have been implemented, either in whole or in part. It is currently considering references on privacy, guardianship and custody, domicile, privity of contract, advance directives, hearsay in criminal proceedings and conditional fees. =The legal profession= In Hong Kong, the legal profession consists of both solicitors and barristers. As of 31 December 2015, there were at least 8,647 practising solicitors and 777 local law firms, plus some 77 foreign law firms, 1,299 registered foreign lawyers. And there were at least 1,378 practising barristers in 135 chambers. Even prior to the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong, Hong Kong's legal profession was open to foreign law firms allowing foreign firms to establish a much earlier foothold in Hong Kong than in the People's Republic of China. Only on 1 July 1992, in contrast, did the PRC government open her legal services market to foreign law firms when the Ministry of Justice issued the Provisional Regulation of Establishment of Offices by Foreign Law Firms regulation.The Internationalization of China's Legal Services Market Thus all of the Magic Circle law firms as well as major U.S. law firms have large presences in Hong Kong. While foreign law firms face much less strict regulations than they would in the People's Republic of China due to the \\"one country, two systems\\" rule, they have seen increasing competition from local firms as PRC firms have become more sophisticated. According to Asia Law & Business, the top foreign Hong Kong law firm of 2007 was Johnson Stokes & Master (now Mayer Brown JSM) while the top PRC law firm was King & Wood PRC Lawyers.ALB Hong Kong Law Awards Chinese firms have seen rapid growth in Hong Kong in the past several years after reunification. The legal bodies governing the conduct of solicitors and barristers are the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association, respectively. There are currently three law schools offering the Postgraduate Certificate in Laws, required for starting work as a trainee solicitor or pupil barrister. =Legal Aid Department ()= The Director of Legal Aid is responsible for the administration of Home Affairs Bureau after 1 July 2007. Eligible persons are provided with legal representation depending on their financial circumstances. Civil cases Legal aid is available for civil proceedings in the District Court, the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal (both part of the High Court), and the Court of Final Appeal. It also covers proceedings in some tribunals and certain Coroner's Court cases. An applicant must satisfy both a 'means test' and a 'merits test'. For the means test, a person whose total financial resources do not exceed $155,800 may be granted legal aid. The Director of Legal Aid may waive the upper financial limit in meritorious cases when a breach of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights or inconsistency with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as applied to Hong Kong is an issue. For the merits test, the Director must be satisfied that an applicant has reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the civil proceedings to which the application relates. A person aggrieved by a decision of the Director may appeal to the Registrar of the High Court. Criminal cases Legal aid is available for committal proceedings in the Magistrates' Courts; cases tried in the District Court and the Court of First Instance of the High Court; and appeals from the Magistrates' Courts, and to the Court of Appeal of the High Court or the Court of Final Appeal. An applicant must satisfy the means test criteria which are the same as for civil cases. Notwithstanding that an applicant's financial resources exceed the statutory limit, the Director of Legal Aid may grant legal aid to the applicant if the Director is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of justice to do so. However, in appeal cases, the Director of Legal Aid must be satisfied that there are meritorious grounds for appeal with a reasonable prospect of success. Notwithstanding the refusal of a legal aid application by the Director of Legal Aid, a judge may himself grant aid if the applicant has satisfied the means test. Applicants in cases involving a charge of murder, treason, or piracy with violence may apply to a judge for granting of legal aid, and exemption from the means test and from payment of contribution. Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme This scheme provides legal representation to the sandwich class whose financial resources are above the upper eligibility limit for legal aid (i.e. $155,800) but do not exceed $432,900. It covers cases involving personal injury or death, as well as medical, dental or legal professional negligence, where the claim for damages is likely to exceed $60,000. The scheme also covers claims under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance irrespective of the amount of the claim. =The Duty Lawyer Service ()= Three programmes of legal assistance, jointly administered by the Law Society and the Bar Association of Hong Kong, are subvented by the Government. The Duty Lawyer Scheme rosters barristers and solicitors in private practice to appear in the Magistrates and Juvenile Courts on a remunerated basis. The scheme provides representation to all juveniles (defendants under 16) and to most adult defendants charged in the Magistrates' Courts who cannot afford private representation. The defendants are required to pay a handling charge of $570 upon granting of Duty Lawyer representation. In 2018, 22,546 defendants were assisted.

The present RCUS is a conservative, Calvinist denomination. It affirms the principles of the Reformation: Sola scriptura (Scripture alone), Solus Christus (Christ alone), Sola gratia (Grace alone), Sola fide (Faith alone), and Soli Deo gloria (Glory to God alone). The RCUS has membership concentrated in South Dakota, Colorado, and California. History Originally known as the German Reformed Church, the RCUS was organized in 1725 thanks largely to the efforts of John Philip Boehm, who immigrated in 1720. He organized the first congregation of German Reformed believers near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, some of them descendants and German immigrants from the turn of the century. Some had immigrated from the Palatine area. He was later joined by other ministers such as George Weiss and Michael Schlatter. Boehm was eventually ordained by the Classis of Amsterdam in 1729, which oversaw the American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church (now the Reformed Church in America). The German Reformed remained under Dutch Reformed oversight until 1793, when the German Reformed adopted their own constitution. In the 1740s, Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf, bishop of the Moravian Church, visited Pennsylvania, with the hopes of uniting the German Lutherans and Reformed with the Moravians, which Boehm staunchly resisted. During the 19th century the German Reformed Church debated issues such as revivalism and especially the Mercersburg Theology of John Nevin and Philip Schaff. In 1866 Samuel Miller, a member of the German Reformed Church, published a work entitled A Treatise on Mercersburg Theology: Mercersburg and Modern Theology Compared. Other controversies, such as debates over liturgy, also occurred in the 19th century. In the second half of the century, the congregations formed their first General Synod, held in 1863. In the 1870s and 1880s, there were attempts, albeit unsuccessful, to unite with the related and Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church. During the twentieth century, the RCUS increasingly shifted toward ecumenism and higher criticism of the Bible. More conservative clergy and members united to form the Eureka Classis of the RCUS, in order to continue classical Reformed worship and polity. In 1934 the RCUS merged with the Evangelical Synod of North America (ESNA) to form the Evangelical and Reformed Church. ESNA featured a mix of both Lutheran and Reformed theology, reflecting the Prussian Union of Churches. The Eureka Classis, however, abjured that merger and decided to identify as the \\"continuing\\" Reformed Church in the United States. The classis objected to the ESNA's admixture of Lutheran teachings with Calvinist practices; most of its churches and members had descended from late 19th-century immigration either from parts of Germany where Reformed confessionalism had taken hold, or from the Volga River region of Russia, where ethnic Germans had been isolated from liberalizing influences in the motherland. By contrast, most RCUS churches, classes, and synods located in the eastern United States had significantly assimilated into generalized or what became known as mainline American Protestantism, and become more ecumenical. The Evangelical and Reformed Church in 1957 merged with the Congregational Christian Churches (which had formed from earlier Congregational and Restorationist churches) to become the United Church of Christ. It has been known for its strongly liberal doctrine and moral stances. In 1986, the Eureka Classis was dissolved; the current Synod has four classes. Polity and beliefs The polity of the RCUS is presbyterian; local congregations elect elders and deacons for guidance. The pastor is the presiding officer of the church council or consistory. The RCUS has around 50 congregations, with about 3,000 baptized members throughout the United States. The congregations are grouped together in four classes: Western Classis, Northern Plains Classis, South Central Classis, Covenant Eastern Classis. A classis is equivalent to a presbytery in Scots-Anglo-Irish Presbyterian denominations. A general, or national, synod convenes annually in mid-spring.  Theology  The old RCUS, as well as the continuing RCUS, originally held only to the Heidelberg Catechism as its statement of faith. In 1995, the Synod officially adopted the Belgic Confession of Faith and the Canons of Dort, which along with Heidelberg are known as the Three Forms of Unity which are commonly used together by Reformed churches (especially those coming out of the Dutch branch of Reformed churches). By holding strictly to these standards, the RCUS maintains a strong affiliation with Calvinism and the 16th-century Reformation. The RCUS believes in biblical inerrancy, including a teaching that Genesis 1:1‚Äî2:4 must be understood as a literal 24-hour, six-day creation account. In keeping with tradition, nearly all congregations prohibit women from voting in church elections. The RCUS also does not allow women to hold special office (elders, deacons, pastor), a stance held by many conservative Reformed or Presbyterian bodies in the United States. In addition, the RCUS rejects some standard positions associated with American fundamentalism such as premillennialism and total abstinence from alcoholic beverages, holding instead a focus on a European Calvinist orthodoxy rather than American-style revivalism. A statement in the 2017 Synod Abstract says \\"ministers of the Word employed by the church shall be subject to dismissal and/or loss of ordination for officiating a same gender marriage ceremony\\".

Article III of the Constitution requires the establishment of a Supreme Court and permits the Congress to create other federal courts, and place limitations on their jurisdiction. Article III federal judges are appointed by the president with the consent of the Senate to serve until they resign, are impeached and convicted, retire, or die. Courts The federal courts are generally divided between trial courts which hear cases in the first instance, and appellate courts which review specific contested decisions made by lower courts. The United States district courts (one in each of the 94 federal judicial districts, and three territorial courts) are general federal trial courts, although in certain cases Congress has diverted original jurisdiction to specialized courts, such as the Court of International Trade, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Alien Terrorist Removal Court, or to Article I or Article IV tribunals. The district courts usually have jurisdiction to hear appeals from such tribunals (unless, for example, appeals are to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.) The United States courts of appeals are the intermediate federal appellate courts. They operate under a system of mandatory review which means they must hear all appeals of right from the lower courts. In some cases, Congress has diverted appellate jurisdiction to specialized courts, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. The federal courts of appeals sit permanently in 13 appellate circuits (11 regional circuits as well as a DC Circuit and the Federal Circuit). Note that there are several other federal courts that bear the phrase \\"Court of Appeals\\" in their names, but they are not Article III courts and are not considered to sit in appellate circuits. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It generally hears appeals from the courts of appeals and sometimes state courts, operating under discretionary review, which means that the Supreme Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction. =Other tribunals= Besides these federal courts, described as Article III courts, there are other adjudicative bodies described as Article I or Article IV courts in reference to the article of the Constitution from which the court's authority stems. There are a number of Article I courts with appellate jurisdiction over specific subject matter including the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, as well as Article I courts with appellate jurisdiction over specific geographic areas such as the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The Article I courts with original jurisdiction over specific subject matter include the bankruptcy courts (for each district court), the immigration courts, the Court of Federal Claims, and the Tax Court. Article IV courts include the High Court of American Samoa and territorial courts such as the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, District Court of Guam, and District Court of the Virgin Islands. Judges Federal judges, like Supreme Court justices, are appointed by the president with the consent of the Senate to serve until they resign, are impeached and convicted, retire, or die. In April 2013, about 10 percent of federal seats were vacant, with 85 of 856 positions unfilled and 4 vacancies on the prestigious Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The high vacancy rate has been attributed to politics, particularly Senate filibustering of potential appointees by Senators.The Editorial Board. (2013). Courts Without Judges. NYTimes. In many cases there is no nominee for the position; however, the Senate has a tradition of senatorial courtesy in which nominees are only considered if the home senators approve.Wheeler R. (2013) What's Behind all Those Judicial Vacancies Without Nominees?. Brookings Institution. In May 2013 Congressional Research Service published a paper analyzing the vacancies and appointment process.McMillion BJ. (2013). President Obama's First-Term U.S. Circuit and District Court Nominations: An Analysis and Comparison with Presidents Since Reagan. CRS. Under Article I of the federal Constitution, Congress also has the power to establish other tribunals, which are usually quite specialized, within the executive branch to assist the president in the execution of his or her powers. Judges who staff them normally serve terms of fixed duration, as do magistrate judges who assist Article III judges. Judges in Article I tribunals attached to executive branch agencies are referred to as administrative law judges (ALJs) and are generally considered to be part of the executive branch even though they exercise quasi-judicial powers. With limited exceptions, they cannot render final judgments in cases involving life, liberty, and private property rights, but may make preliminary rulings subject to review by an Article III judge. Administration * The Judicial Conference of the United States is the policymaking body of the U.S. federal courts. The conference is responsible for creating and revising federal procedural rules pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act. * The Administrative Office of the United States Courts is the primary support agency for the U.S. federal courts. It is directly responsible to the Judicial Conference. The AO prepares the judiciary's budget, provides and operates secure court facilities, and provides the clerical and administrative staff essential to the efficient operation of the courts. * The judicial councils are panels within each circuit charged with making \\"necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice\\". * The Federal Judicial Center is the primary research and education agency for the U.S. federal courts. * The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transfers and consolidates cases in multiple judicial districts that share common factual issues. * The United States Marshals Service is an Executive Branch agency that is responsible for providing protection for the federal judiciary and transporting federal prisoners. * The Supreme Court Police provide security for the Supreme Court building. * Federal Commissioner for Judicial Affairs Legal procedure The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution as placing some additional restrictions on the federal courts. For example, the doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and standing prohibit district courts from issuing advisory opinions. Other doctrines, such as the abstention doctrine and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine limit the power of lower federal courts to disturb rulings made by state courts. The Erie doctrine requires federal courts to apply substantive state law to claims arising from state law (which may be heard in federal courts under supplemental or diversity jurisdiction). In difficult cases, the federal courts must either guess as to how a court of that state would decide the issue or, if that state accepts certified questions from federal courts when state law is unclear or uncertain, ask an appellate court of that state to decide the issue. Notably, the only federal court that can issue proclamations of federal law that bind state courts is the Supreme Court itself. Decisions of the lower federal courts, whether on issues of federal law or state law (i.e., the question was not certified to a state court), are persuasive but not binding authority in the states in which those federal courts sit.People v. Leonard, 40 Cal. 4th 1370, 1416 (2007) (Ninth Circuit decisions do not bind Supreme Court of California). Some commentators assert that another limitation upon federal courts is executive nonacquiescence in judicial decisions, where the executive simply refuses to accept them as binding precedent.Gregory C. Sisk, Litigation with the Federal Government (Philadelphia: American Law Institute, 2006), 418-425.Robert J. Hume, How Courts Impact Federal Administrative Behavior (New York: Routledge, 2009), 92-106. In the context of administration of U.S. internal revenue laws by the Internal Revenue Service, nonacquiescences (published in a series of documents called Actions on Decisions) \\"generally do not affect the application of stare decisis or the rule of precedent\\". The IRS \\"will recognize these principles and generally concede issues accordingly during administrative proceedings.\\" In rare cases, however, the IRS may continue to litigate a legal issue in a given circuit even where the IRS has already lost a case on that issue in that circuit.Mitchell Rogovin & Donald L. Korb, \\"The Four R's Revisited: Regulations, Rulings, Reliance, and Retroactivity in the 21st Century: A View From Within\\", 46 Duquesne Law Review 323, 366-367 (2008). History The Articles of Confederation provided a clear basis for the initial establishment of United States of America judicial authority by Congress prior to the Constitution. This authority, enumerated by Article IX, allowed for the establishment of United States jurisdiction in the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, final appeals from state court decisions in all cases of captures of enemy ships, last resort for resolution of disputes between two or more states (including disputes over borders and jurisdiction), and final determination of controversies between private parties arising from conflicting land grants issued by two or more states prior to settlement of which state actually has jurisdiction over the territory. The Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture was the first United States Court established by the United States. Additional United States courts were established to adjudicate border disputes between the states of Connecticut and Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts, Georgia and South Carolina. Lastly, a United States court was established for the Northwest Territory. When the Constitution came into force in 1789, Congress gained the authority to establish the federal judicial system as a whole. Only the Supreme Court was established by the Constitution itself. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the first inferior (i.e., lower) federal courts established pursuant to the Constitution and provided for the first Article III judges. Virtually all U.S. law schools offer an elective course that focuses specifically on the powers and limitations of U.S. federal courts, with coverage of topics such as justiciability, abstention doctrines, the abrogation doctrine, and habeas corpus.Michael L.

An Austrian scientist, Friederike Spitzenberger, stumbled upon the species in a live trap. Its species status was confirmed by genetic studies, and it was found to be very closely related to Liechtenstein's vole (Microtus liechtensteini) from the Eastern Alps.

As an unincorporated area, it does not have clearly defined geographic boundaries, but it grew around the former village of Maple, centred at the intersection of Major Mackenzie Drive and Keele Street in Vaughan. Geography Maple is located in the Golden Horseshoe of Southern Ontario. To the northeast of is the Oak Ridges Moraine, which supplies a lot of water to the Greater Toronto Area. The west branch of the Don River rises to the northwest and flows 1 km west of Maple. Several creeks are to the east and the Black Creek begins slightly west of Vellore. Humber River flows in the west, the Don River flows to the northern and the eastern part. York University Keele Campus lies to the south of Steeles Avenue, within the city of Toronto. Climate Maple has a continental climate moderated by the Great Lakes and influenced by warm, moist air masses from the south, and cold, dry air from the north. Transportation The building at the Maple GO Station is a federally designated heritage railway station Maple's central cross streets are Major Mackenzie Drive and Keele Street. The nearest major highway exit is 3 km west at Highway 400 and Major Mackenzie, with access also at Highway 400 and Rutherford Rd. Industrial areas are south and west of Maple, closer to Highway 407, and the Canadian National yards north of Highway 7 (Ontario). Maple is located 13 km NE of Woodbridge, 11 km E of Kleinburg 8 km S of King City, 6.5 km from downtown Richmond Hill 12 km NW of Thornhill N of Highway 401, and SSE of Barrie. Maple is accessed by the GO Transit Barrie commuter line, with rail stations at Maple and Rutherford GO stations. Toronto Transit Commission, York Region Transit, and GO Transit buses serve the area. The Maple GO Station, built in 1903 by the Grand Trunk Railroad, is a federally designated a heritage railway station. Maple formerly had a small airport in the west, the Maple Airport, which closed down in 1987. The runways ran diagonally like the letter x, the runway from northwest to southeast was the longer, and the other ran southwest to northeast. Streets like Avro, Lockheed, and Mustang on the site of the airport are named after airplanes. In 2006 Maple gained bus-rapid-transit service under York Region's Transit (YRT) system. History The founding families of Maple were the Noble and the Rupert families. The Nobles settled around the present Major Mackenzie Drive and Keele Street intersection in the early half of the 19th century. In 1852 the town was called Noble‚Äôs Corner after Joseph Noble, the first Postmaster. Later, a Doctor Rupert lived in Maple and was such a respected member of the community that the town‚Äôs name was changed to Rupertsville. Local folklore associates the name \\"Maple\\" with the numerous maple trees once found along Keele Street in the town. Maple was dominated for most of the 19th century by the more prosperous towns of Sherwood and Teston. Keele Street was then a boggy swamp area that forced most travelers to take alternate routes. Once the Ontario, Huron, and Simcoe Railway built a line through Maple, the town began to grow. The station was then called Richmond Hill. The Canadian National Railway bought the line in early 1900 and the station was renamed Maple.https://www.vaughan.ca/services/vaughan_archives/historyofvaughan/VaughanDocuments/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Maple.pdf Maple, as a centre of agriculture, was enhanced with the proximity of the CNR line, as well as the growing urban development of Toronto. A major Ontario Department of Lands and Forests office was situated there in the 1960s. Housing developments began in the 1960s in the southwest, as well as replacement of homes damaged in the August 1962 fire and explosion at an industrial propane depot. Massive housing developments did not began until the 1980s in the northwest, near McNaughton. A gravel pit was in the area north of Major Mackenzie, from the CN line to Dufferin Street. This became the Keele Valley Landfill, which was owned and operated by Metropolitan Toronto, and later by the city of Toronto. The landfill began receiving much of the GTA's garbage when the Beare Road Landfill in Scarborough reached capacity and was decommissioned. The Keele Valley Landfill was closed on New Year's Eve 2002 when it reached its capacity. The site has become reserved for the \\"Eagle's Nest\\" golf course, and other developments which will occur in the future once the buried waste decomposes sufficiently. Canada's Wonderland first opened in 1981. Maple's proximity to Toronto and its major transportation corridors, and Vaughan's own political support for development, have led to the heavy development and population growth. In 1993, housing development began in the area of what was the Maple Airport. In 1995, it expanded to the western part of Maple. Between 1997 and 1999, urban developments reached the northwestern part of Maple and Melville and the Don to the train tracks. Developments also reached the northeastern part and the southeastern part. Megalot houses began developing northeast of Maple near Dufferin in the late-1990s. The housing developments began up to the Highway 400 in the northwest. Housing developments have begun near Vellore. , developments reached the northwestern part as far as Highway 400, Teston Road, the CN line and the southwest. Most of the housing developments in the early-2000s reached Pine Valley Drive in the southwest in Vellore Village and Vellore Woods. The housing and urban developments is currently in the west between Highway 400 and Weston and Major Mackenzie and will reach to Teston. Maple is home to one of the largest mosques in Canada. Baitul Islam Mosque is located on Jane Street south of Teston Road, where a planned subdivision named Peace Village was established in 1999.

He was the first man to travel over 100 miles per hour on water. Early life Miss America 2, a triple Liberty V-12-powered 1921 Harmsworth Trophy winner, and second of nine Miss Americas built for Wood Gar Wood was born on December 4, 1880 in Mapleton, Iowa, into a family of 13 children. His father was a ferryboat operator on Lake Osakis, Minnesota, and Gar worked on boats from an early age. In 1911, at age 31, he invented a hydraulic lift for unloading coal from rail trucks. Garwood Industries He established the Wood Hoist Co. in Detroit, Michigan, and soon became a successful businessman. Later, he changed the company's name to Garwood Industries, which built racing and pleasure boats under the Gar Wood brand. Wood also capitalized on experience with coal unloaders to successfully produce and market GarWood truck, bus and coach bodies. He had a home in Algonac, Michigan. Garwood Industries also built truck bodies, tractor attachments and winches that were used by truck and tractor manufacturers such as Allis- Chalmershttps://contractormag.co.nz/classic-machines/garwood/, International Harvester, and were an OEM supplier to both the civilian and military market. Many trucks built during World War II came equipped with Garwood bodies and winches. Garwood Industries also developed the garbage truck, originally sold as the Garwood Load Packer. Racing career In 1916, Wood purchased a motorboat for racing called Miss Detroit. He also bought the company that made it, run by brothers Chris and Henry Smith (who would work for Wood until 1922, when Chris formed the Chris Smith & Sons Boat Company in Algonac, Michigan, renamed Chris-Craft in 1924). This led directly to the construction of Gar Wood brand pleasure craft. Initially still focused on racing, Wood set a new water speed record of in 1920 on the Detroit River, using a new twin Liberty V-12 powered boat called Miss America. In the following twelve years, Wood built nine more Miss Americas and broke the record five times, raising it to in 1932 on the St. Clair River. In 1921, Wood raced one of his boats against the Havana Special train, up the Atlantic coast from Miami to New York City. Wood made the trip in 47 hours and 23 minutes and beat the train by 12 minutes. In 1925, he raced the Twentieth Century Limited train up the Hudson River between Albany and New York and won by 22 minutes. As well as being a record breaker and showman, Wood won five straight powerboat Gold Cup races between 1917 and 1921. Wood also won the prestigious Harmsworth Trophy nine times (1920‚Äì21, 1926, 1928‚Äì30, 1932‚Äì33). In 1931, he lost the Trophy in dramatic circumstances to his younger brother George. The race was held on the Detroit River and was billed as a match race between the Wood brothers and English (sic) racing driver and record-breaker Kaye Don, driving Miss England II. Before an estimated crowd of over a million spectators (one of the largest crowds for a sporting event ever), Don won the first heat of the race. In the second heat, Wood was leading Don, when Miss England II suddenly flipped over rounding one of the turns, without injury to Don and his co-driver. Gar Wood finished the race first, but both he and Don were disqualified because they had jumped the starter's gun by seven seconds. George Wood completed the final race to win the trophy. In April, 1936, Wood, along with many other sports champions and stand outs, was honored at a banquet in Detroit, MI. This banquet was the first celebration of Champions Day. In July, 1936, a plaque was presented to Detroit from the White House honoring Detroit as the City of Champions. The plaque has five \\"medallions\\" featuring athletes. One of these medallions is of a power boat racer, representing Wood. Wood retired from racing in 1933 to concentrate on his businesses. Gar Wood boats Garwood Industries began building boats under the \\"Gar Wood\\" brand following his early successes racing. The most famous were the exclusive Liberty V-12-powered 33‚Äô \\"Baby Gar\\" gentleman‚Äôs racer built in the 1920s and early 1930s.Gar Wood History, ‚ÄúBaby Gar‚Äù Era Along with numerous models of runabouts (variously available as sedans, landaus, and limousines), a 28' \\"Baby Gar\\", a 25' triple- cockpit runabout, and 40' commuter, a limited number of the 16 ft Gar Wood Speedsters were built from 1934 to 1938.https://www.garwood.com/index.php/gar- wood-history/ Starting in 1935 a 20' utility and 26' family cruiser were made, followed by an 18' utility and 36' express cruiser in 1936. During World War II Garwood Industries produced a limited number of tugboats and target craft for the U.S. Navy. After the war, however, new technologies such as plywood and fiberglass, and mass production methods, entered the pleasure boating world. The company continued to build its traditional all wood boats until 1947, when it ended production. Inventions Wood was known as an inventive genius who, at one point, held more US patents than any other living American. In 1897, at age 17, he invented a downdraft carburetor which enabled his inspection boat to outrace the other inspectors. In 1911 or 1912 he invented the profitable hydraulic hoist for dump trucks. He used the money It earned to build racing boats which won many championships between 1917 and 1933. At one point he had a job selling lightning rods to farmers, and to demonstrate their effectiveness he invented an induction coil device to mimic lightning. Retirement and later years In the 1950s, Wood acquired Fisher Island in South Florida's Biscayne Bay, the last of a series of millionaires to occupy it as a one-family island retreat. He sold it to a development group in 1963. Wood also had a summer retreat in McGregor Bay, Ontario. A 1967 Popular Mechanics article showed even in retirement Wood was still active inventing an Electric Vehicle (EV) controller, which he used in the EV he built. Wood died in Miami 16 Jun 1971, at age 90 and days before the 50th anniversary of his first Harmsworth win. Upon his death, George Van of The Detroit News wrote: ‚ÄúTo the public, he was Tom Swift, Jules Verne, Frank Merriwell with a little bit of Horatio Alger thrown in.‚Äù Wood was buried near his home in Algonac, Michigan.

Early scientific research into food technology concentrated on food preservation. Nicolas Appert‚Äôs development in 1810 of the canning process was a decisive event. The process wasn‚Äôt called canning then and Appert did not really know the principle on which his process worked, but canning has had a major impact on food preservation techniques. Louis Pasteur's research on the spoilage of wine and his description of how to avoid spoilage in 1864 was an early attempt to apply scientific knowledge to food handling. Besides research into wine spoilage, Pasteur researched the production of alcohol, vinegar, wines and beer, and the souring of milk. He developed pasteurization‚Äîthe process of heating milk and milk products to destroy food spoilage and disease-producing organisms. In his research into food technology, Pasteur became the pioneer into bacteriology and of modern preventive medicine.  Developments  Freeze-dried coffee, a form of instant coffee Developments in food technology have contributed greatly to the food supply and have changed our world. Some of these developments are: * Instantized Milk Powder - D.D. Peebles (U.S. patent 2,835,586) developed the first instant milk powder, which has become the basis for a variety of new products that are rehydratable. This process increases the surface area of the powdered product by partially rehydrating spray-dried milk powder. * Freeze- drying - The first application of freeze drying was most likely in the pharmaceutical industry; however, a successful large-scale industrial application of the process was the development of continuous freeze drying of coffee. * High-Temperature Short Time Processing - These processes, for the most part, are characterized by rapid heating and cooling, holding for a short time at a relatively high temperature and filling aseptically into sterile containers. * Decaffeination of Coffee and Tea - Decaffeinated coffee and tea was first developed on a commercial basis in Europe around 1900. The process is described in U.S. patent 897,763. Green coffee beans are treated with water, heat and solvents to remove the caffeine from the beans. * Process optimization - Food Technology now allows production of foods to be more efficient, Oil saving technologies are now available on different forms. Production methods and methodology have also become increasingly sophisticated.  Consumer acceptance  Historically, consumers paid little attention to food technologies. Nowadays, the food production chain is long and complicated and food technologies are diverse. Consequently consumers are uncertain about the determinants of food quality and find it difficult to understand them. Now, acceptance of food products very often depends on perceived benefits and risks associated with food. Popular views of food processing technologies matter. Especially innovative food processing technologies often are perceived as risky by consumersUeland √ñ, G. H., Holm, F., Kalogeras, N., Leino, O., Luteijn, J., Magnusson, S.(2011). State of the art in benefit-risk analysis: Consumer perception. Food and Chemical Toxicology, 52(1) Acceptance of the different food technologies varies. While pasteurization is well recognized and accepted, high pressure treatment and even microwaves often are perceived as risky. Studies by the Hightech Europe project found that traditional technologies were well accepted in contrast to innovative technologies. Consumers form their attitude towards innovative food technologies through three main mechanisms: First, through knowledge or beliefs about risks and benefits correlated with the technology; second, through attitudes based on their own experience; and third, through application of higher order values and beliefs.Olsen, N. V., Grunert, K.G., & Anne-Mette, S. (2010). Consumer acceptance of high-pressure processing and pulsed-electric field: a review. Trends in Food Science & Technology, 21(446-472) A number of scholars consider the risk-benefit trade-off as one of the main determinants of consumer acceptance, although some researchers place more emphasis on the role of benefit perception (rather than risk) in consumer acceptance. Rogers (2010) defines five major criteria that explain differences in the acceptance of new technology by consumers: complexity, compatibility, relative advantage, trialability and observability. Acceptance of innovative technologies can be improved by providing non-emotional and concise information about these new technological processes methods. The HighTech project also suggests that written information has a higher impact on consumers than audio-visual information.

Retrieved 04 June 2019  Early life and education  Gerome Kamrowski was born in Warren, Minnesota, on January 19, 1914. In 1932 he enrolled in the Saint Paul School of Art (now Minnesota Museum of American Art - MMAA), where he studied with Leroy Turner, and Cameron Booth. Both Turner and Booth had been students of Hans Hofmann, and were also associated with the Abstraction-Cr√©ation group in Paris. It was from these peers that Kamrowski was introduced to a \\"kind of expressionist cubism.\\"Smithsonian American Art Museum, Art + Artists: Artists \\"Gerome Kamrowski\\" Retrieved 04 June 2019 In 1933 Kamrowski was awarded a scholarship to the Art Students League, where he would study in New York under Hans Hofmann. Unfortunately immigration problems had prevented Hofmann from assuming his post. Nevertheless, Kamrowski decided to remain in New York for a short time, to attend classes taught by George Grosz. After a few weeks, he returned to St. Paul, and found a position in the mural painting division of the Minnesota FAP/WPA (Works Progress Administration). In 1936 he contributed ‚ÄúSynthetic Cubist Style‚Äù frescoes in the Northrup Auditorium of the University of Minnesota.Kamrowski, Biography Gerome Kamrowski 1914-2004 Retrieved 04 June 2019 In 1937 Kamrowski went to Chicago to study under Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Alexander Archipenko at the New Bauhaus (now Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Design). There he was exposed to new and interesting ideas regarding the role of nature in art and the \\"geometric basis of natural form\\".  New York years  In 1938 Kamrowski received a Guggenheim fellowship to attend Hans Hofmann's summer school in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He then relocated to New York where he met William Baziotes. Together they shared a fascination in Surrealist automatic writing, and both artists explored its possibilities in their paintings. Kamrowski was particularly drawn to Surrealism's fundamental appeal of intuition over intellect. He was interested seeking a process that \\"binds all things together...a kind of cosmic rhythm\\". Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s while living in New York, Kamrowski became an integral part of the emerging surrealists. In 1942, the artist Roberto Matta attempted to form a group of artists to investigate new applications for Surrealist methods. He invited Kamrowski, along with William Baziotes, Jackson Pollock, Peter Busa, and Robert Motherwell to join. Like Kamrowski, the others were more interested in process than in subject matter‚Äîthe foundation of Matta's art‚Äîand the group soon dissolved. But no matter how short lived the collaboration was, this group was the kernel of the open-ended movement that was referred to as abstract surrealism and would over time prove to be the beginnings of abstract expressionism.Keith Sheridan Fine Prints, Gerome Kamrowski 1914-2004 Retrieved 04 June 2019 It was during this time, the winter of 1939/1940, that an amazing collaboration was made. Kamrowski and two of his contemporaries, William Baziotes and Jackson Pollock, came together and began to paint. The description of this historic event is described as follows in \\"Pollock\\" by Ellen G. Landau: \\"For a number of years, Kamrowski had been involved with Surrealist image-coaxing techniques. In a letter to B.H. Friedman, Kamrowski recalled that one day he, Pollock, and Baziotes were fooling around' with quart-cans of lacquer paint. Baziotes asked if he could use some 'to show Pollock how the paint could be spun around.' He then looked around the room for something to work on, and a canvas that Kamrowski had 'been pouring paint on and was not going well' was handy, so Baziotes began to throw and drip' white paint on it. He next gave the dripping palette knife to Jackson, who with his intense concentration' started flipping the paint with abandon. ' According to Kamrowski, after all had a chance to play, Baziotes identified the spiral forms he had created as 'birds' nests, ' but Pollock refused to interpret his spots.\\" This painting was a pivotal work, showing the transition from, and fusion of, Surrealism to Action Painting and Abstract Expressionism.Karamanoukian, Jacques. \\"Gerome Kamrowski: Art, Fame & Fortune.\\" Agenda April 1997, P. 7 & 8\\\\. Ann Arbor District Library Retrieved 04 June 2019. In 1947, Kamrowski was invited to the Surrealist Exhibition in Paris by Surrealist leader Andr√© Breton. Breton said of him, \\"Of all the young painters whose evolution I have been able to follow in New York during the last years of the war, Gerome Kamrowski is the one who has impressed me far the most by reason of the \\"quality\\" and sustained character of his research. Among all the newcomers there, he was the only one...tunnelling in a new direction...\\"  Michigan years  In the 1940s Kamrowski relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan in order to teach at the University of Michigan School of Art. It was a career that would span thirty-eight years, and would encourage countless others to push their artistic boundaries. Professor Jon Rush, at the University's School of Art and Design, stated: \\"As a teacher, Professor Kamrowski admonished his students to experiment and push the boundaries of their art. He urged them to be unafraid of failure and consider it a natural part of the creative process,\\" and says \\"Above all, he stressed the importance of finding one's own path and that it would take hard work and dedication to achieve that. He was a natural teacher who related well to students because he himself never stopped being one.\\"Nesbit, Joanne. \\"Obituary: Gerome Kamrowski.\\" The University Record Online. 05 April 2004. Pars. 1 and 2. Retrieved 06 June 2019 Teaching became a second passion. Over the years, Kamrowski's energy and drive never faltered, and his style continued to evolve dynamically from the abstract intellectual exercises of the past to colorful 3-D pieces often made of glass, cement, and random found objects. He worked every day and exhibited steadily in Michigan and elsewhere.Rieke, Stepahnie. \\"Kamrowski's Last Hurrah: an avant-garde legend in Chelsea.\\" The Ann Arbor Observer: Nov 2004. Par. 5.

Category:March in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"March 23 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"1636650","text":"The New Zealand greater short-tailed bat (Mystacina robusta) is one of two species of New Zealand short-tailed bats, a family (Mystacinidae) unique to New Zealand. Larger than the New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat, there have been no confirmed sightings of this species since 1965 and it is considered to be critically endangered, if not extinct. In prehistoric times it lived in the North and South Islands but by the time of European arrival was restricted to small islands near Stewart Island/Rakiura. It is thought that a rat invasion of Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island in 1963 led to the species extinction.  Description  M. robusta was not considered to be separate from the New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) until 1962, when it was suggested as a subspecies. It was not recognized as a completely separate species within Mystacinidae until 1985, long after it was thought to have become extinct. Morphologically, M. robusta is larger than M. tuberculata with specimens of the former having a mean forearm length of 45.3-47.5mm as opposed to the latter, 40-45mm, which also has larger ears that reach beyond the muzzle when pushed forward. It is described as having a wingspan of 300mm and a body length of 90mm.  Species biology  Very little is known about the biology of the species, since it was not recognized as a separate species until after it is believed to have become extinct. Edgar Stead visited Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island in 1936 and made several observations. He described the species as flying no more than ‚Äúten feet above the ground‚Äù and always after dusk. At one point he found seven bats roosting in a tree cavity in a state of torpor. After capturing a few and putting them in a cage they crawled around on the floor, much like New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats are known to do. As well as roosting in tree cavities, it is known that they roosted in granite caves on Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island and Rerewhakaupoko/Solomon Island. The few existing photos show that this species had dark-brown fur and darker wings. Nothing is known about their natural diet; however, it is likely to be similar to the diet of the closely related lesser short-tailed bat, which eats insects, especially beetles, flies, and moths, as well as flowers, fruit, nectar, and pollen. As a highly endangered member of an ancient evolutionary family, the species is accorded a high ranking on the EDGE list of mammals, sitting fourth.  Distribution  Sub- fossil evidence suggests that M. robusta was widespread throughout New Zealand until the arrival of the Polynesian rat/Kiore. There are no records of this species from the North Island and South Island since the arrival of Europeans and it was probably restricted to several islands near Stewart island/Rakiura by this time. The only records from the twentieth century are from caves on Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island and Rerewhakaupoko/Solomon Island. Here it survived in the absence of rats until the 1960s.  Conservation status  The last refuge of this species was Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island until ship rats (Rattus rattus) were accidentally introduced in 1963. This rodent invasion decimated the bird life of the island, leading to the extinction of Stead's bush wren (Xenicus longipes variabilis) and South Island snipe (Coenocorypha iredalei). The South Island saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus) was only saved by the translocation of 36 individuals to a nearby island. M. robusta, not recognized as a separate species at the time, was not considered a priority for conservation effort and is believed to have subsequently become extinct, last seen in 1965. More recently, eyewitness reports of bats from Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island and nearby Putauhina Island have spurred new searches for this species. In 1999 an expedition to the islands recorded unusual ‚Äúmystacinid-like‚Äù echolocation calls on Putauhina Island but no bats were seen or caught on this or a subsequent expedition in 2009. As a result of this evidence the IUCN status of the species, formerly listed as extinct, has been changed to ‚Äòcritically endangered‚Äô and the New Zealand threat classification is currently ‚Äòdata deficient‚Äô. Further searches are required to ascertain if the species still persists on these islands. Due to its imperiled status, it is identified by the Alliance for Zero Extinction as a species in danger of imminent extinction. The bat is among the 25 ‚Äúmost wanted lost‚Äù species that are the focus of Global Wildlife Conservation's ‚ÄúSearch for Lost Species‚Äù initiative.

Its episcopal see is the (Marian) Cathedral of the Annunciation in Stockton. It is a suffragan in the ecclesiastical province of the Metropolitan Archbishop of San Francisco  Extent and statistics  As per 2015, its bishop pastorally serves 250,692 Catholics (18.4% of 1,361,162 total) on 15,995 km¬≤ in 35 parishes with 97 priests (83 diocesan, 14 religious), 51 deacons, 66 lay religious (15 brothers, 51 sisters), 6 seminarians and 12 missions.http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/stoc1.htm It covers the secular Counties of Alpine, Calaveras, Mono, San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Tuolumne. The diocese is geographically and ethnically diverse. The majority of the population lives in the San Joaquin Valley. The two major population cities are Stockton and Modesto. The diocese has shown a significant population increase in all counties except Alpine County. The majority of San Joaquin Valley is farming, and there are many migrant camps in which the Church has a presence. Calaveras, Tuolumne and Alpine counties are located on the western side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Most parishes in these counties date back to the gold rush days. Mono County is on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range and is usually cut off from the rest of the diocese during winter. The parish church located in Mammoth Lakes provides for the spiritual care of vacationers during the winter and summer. The largest racial/ethnic groups in the Diocese are White and Hispanic. There are also many of Filipino and South East Asian descent. The largest Azorean Portuguese population outside the Azores is found in the Diocese of Stockton. It is estimated that 60% of the diocesan Catholic population is Hispanic. However, this does not imply that Spanish is their first language, only that their heritage is Spanish. The largest Pacific Island community is the Filipino community. Then the next largest ethnic concentration is Vietnamese. The USCCB statement Asian and Pacific Presencehttp://www.usccb.org/issues-and- action/cultural-diversity/asian-pacific-islander/asian-and-pacific-presence- harmony-in-faith.cfm lists the Diocese of Stockton as among the top thirty dioceses in the United States with the highest Asian and Pacific Island population. Within the Diocese, Mass is celebrated more than 180 times each Sunday in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin and Laotian. Weekday masses are celebrated in these languages and Vietnamese. Its fellow suffragans in the -mainly Californian- ecclesiastical province of the Archbishop of San Francisco include the Dioceses of Honolulu (on Hawaii), Las Vegas, Oakland, Reno, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Jose, Santa Rosa.  History  The Diocese of Stockton was formed on January 13, 1962 on Californian territories split off from the Archdiocese of San Francisco (which remains its Metropolitan) and from the Diocese of Sacramento. In 1966 it gained more territory from the Diocese of Sacramento. =Sex Abuse and Bankruptcy= In 1998 a jury awarded two brothers $30 million in a judgement against the Diocese of Stockton over its handling of a priest who sexually abused the men while they were boys, starting when they were three. At the trial it was revealed that in a 1976 letter to his superiors Oliver O'Grady, the abusive priest, had admitted to sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl. In 1984 an attorney for the diocese promised to get O'Grady away from children, a promise recorded in a police report. O'Grady abused the boys who later brought the suit from 1978-1991. In 1993 he pleaded guilty to abusing them and was sentenced to 14 years in prison.reprent of San Francisco Chronicle July 16, 1998 article in bishopaccountability.org During the O'Grady trial Mahony claimed that O'Grady was the only accused priest he dealt with in Stockton. Later in 2004 Mahony admitted under oath that parents had confronted him with accusations against another priest in the diocese, Antonio Munoz.Bishopaccountability database on accusations against priests connected with the Stockton diocese In 2014, the Diocese filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, which was later granted in 2017.http://www.pszjlaw.com/creditor-64.html As a result of the bankruptcy agreement, approximately $15 million had to be paid to various people who were sexually abused by clergy in the Diocese.https://www.uniondemocrat.com/localnews/4976000-151/embattled- stockton-diocese-nears-bankruptcy-exit-attorneys-and BishopsBishops of Stockton= # Hugh Aloysius Donohoe (1962-1969), appointed Bishop of Fresno # Merlin Guilfoyle (1970-1979) # Roger Mahony (1980-1985), appointed Archbishop of Los Angeles (Cardinal in 1991) # Donald Montrose (1985-1999) # Stephen Blaire (1999-2018) # Myron Joseph Cotta (2018‚Äìpresent) =Other priest of this diocese who became bishop= *Ramon Bejarano, appointed auxiliary bishop of San Diego in 2020  Parishes  The Diocese of Stockton consists of eight deaneries.

It was completed in 1996. Designed by Oscar Niemeyer with the assistance of structural engineer Bruno Contarini, who had worked with Niemeyer on earlier projects, the MAC- Niter√≥i is 16 meters high; its cupola has a diameter of 50 meters with three floors. The museum has a collection of 1,217 works from the art collector Jo√£o Sattamini. A collection assembled since the 1950s by that collector, constituted by the second largest collection of contemporary art in Brazil.http://www.macniteroi.com.br/ The museum projects itself over Boa Viagem (‚ÄúBon Voyage,‚Äù ‚ÄúGood Journey‚Äù) beach and also a neighborhood, the reflecting pool that surrounds the cylindrical base ‚Äúlike a flower,‚Äù in the words of Niemeyer. A wide access slope leads to a Hall of Expositions, which has a capacity for sixty people. Two doors lead to the viewing gallery, through which can be seen Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, and Sugarloaf Mountain. The saucer-shaped modernist structure, which has been likened to a UFO, is set on a cliffside, at the bottom of which is a beach. In the film Oscar Niemeyer, an architect committed to his century, Niemeyer is seen flying over Rio de Janeiro in a UFO which then lands on the site, suggesting this to be the origin of the museum.Marc Henri Wajnberg, 2000 MAC Scandal The MAC Scandal was a political scandal that surrounded the acquisition of land for the museum. The sub-mayor of Niter√≥i's Oceanic Region, Zeca Mocarzel, convinced the owner of the land that constructions rights were locked by the city council and, therefore, were able to purchase the land at a low price. When the mayor, Jorge Roberto Silveira, sent the museum project to the city council to obtain the rights to construction, it was accepted in only two days. After the inauguration of the MAC, which substantially increased the property values of nearby areas, the land was sold for more than 5 million reals, approximately 1,250,000 US dollars in 1996. Because the land deal took place just before Christmas, the people of Niter√≥i said that it was a Christmas present that Jorge Roberto Silveira, Zeca Mocarzel and Jo√£o Sampaio's (another long-time Niter√≥i's politician) gave to themselves.

It was first recorded in 1931 and was observed roosting with the larger and much more common Mariana fruit bat. The last specimen was a female found roosting at Tarague cliff in March 1967, but it escaped capture. An unconfirmed sighting took place sometime during the 1970s and no other individuals have been sighted since then. Description The Guam flying fox has a length of about , a wingspan of about , and a body weight of . It is very similar in appearance to the Chuuk flying fox (Pteropus insularis). The top of the head is greyish, the back, throat and underparts brown or dark brown and the side of the neck golden-brown. Behaviour Little is known of the behaviour of this flying fox but it is likely to have fed on the fruits, flowers and foliage of evergreen shrubs and trees typical of the limestone forests that occur in the northern part of Guam. Nor is much known of its reproductive habits, but an individual observed in 1968, when a female was shot, was accompanied by an immature individual which suggests that there may have been some on-going parental care. Status There are no confirmed records of sightings of this bat since the 1970s and the IUCN lists it as being \\"Extinct\\". When it was more plentiful it was hunted by humans for food, which may have contributed to its extinction. Another factor may have been the introduction into the island of the predatory Brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis). FootnotesReferences * Flannery, Tim and Peter Schouten (2001). A Gap in Nature.

Directed by and starring Jack Nicholson, it also features Harvey Keitel, Meg Tilly, Madeleine Stowe, Richard Farnsworth, Frederic Forrest, David Keith, Rub√©n Blades, Tracey Walter and Eli Wallach. Reprising their roles from Chinatown are Joe Mantell, Perry Lopez, James Hong, and, in a brief voice-over, Faye Dunaway. The character of Katherine Mulwray returns as well, played by Tilly. The musical score for the film is by Van Dyke Parks, who also appears as a prosecuting attorney. The screenplay is by Robert Towne, whose script for Chinatown won an Academy Award. The Two Jakes faced a troubled production, and went through several years of development hell. Various different actors were attached at several points, including Joe Pesci and Roy Scheider, with screenwriter Towne also at one point set to direct and producer Evans set to co-star. Filming finally took place with Nicholson at the helm, filming around Los Angeles in the early summer of 1989. The film was released by Paramount Pictures on August 10, 1990. The film received mixed reviews was not a box office success, and plans for a third film about J. J. Gittes, with him near the end of his life, were abandoned. Plot In Los Angeles in 1948, Julius \\"Jake\\" Berman hires private investigator J. J. \\"Jake\\" Gittes to catch his wife, Kitty, in the act of committing adultery. During the sting, Berman kills his love rival, Mark Bodine, who happens to be his business partner in a real estate development company. Gittes, not having known this, suddenly finds himself under scrutiny for his role in the possible crime, all of which centers around a wire recording that captured the illicit love meeting, the confrontation, and the killing of Bodine. It calls into question if Berman knew and killed his partner to wrest control of the partnership, making it murder, or was an act of jealousy, which may qualify as \\"temporary insanity\\" and be permitted as a defense to a charge of murder. Gittes must convince LAPD captain Escobar that he should not be charged as an accomplice. Oddly, Berman seems unconcerned with the possibility that he may be accused of murder. Gittes has the recording, which Berman's attorney, Cotton Weinberger, and mobster friend Mickey Nice, both want, locked in a safe in his office in L.A., which is being rocked by earthquakes. Berman's housing development in the Valley also is experiencing seismic activities. Gittes is nearly killed in a gas explosion, waking to find Berman and wife, Kitty, standing over him. Gittes has a confrontation, and later a sexual encounter, with Lilian Bodine, the dead man's angry widow. He is presented with proof that Earl Rawley, a wealthy and ruthless oil man, may be drilling under the Bodine and Berman development, though Rawley has denied it. This leads to a need to determine who owns the mineral rights to the land. Gittes discovers that the rights are owned by one Katherine Mulwray, daughter of Evelyn Mulwray, his love interest from eleven years prior. He also discovers that the deed transfers were executed in such a way as to attempt to hide Katherine Mulwray's prior ownership and continued claim of the mineral rights. Furthermore, he also discovers that Noah Cross had already died and Katherine had escaped from his gasp. Gittes operatives have seen Berman in the company of a blond woman along with Mickey, and a bodyguard. With a bit of sleuthing Gittes determines that the woman is an oncologist and is treating Berman for cancer somewhere below the waist. Gittes confronts Berman with this knowledge and gets a full confession. Along the way, Gittes discovers that Berman is not going to survive and the entire set-up was to ensure that Kitty was protected once he died. In order to get Kitty to talk to him, Gittes must prove that Berman set out to kill his partner. Once accomplished, Kitty agrees to meet Gittes and tell him what she knows about Berman. In the process of discussing Berman's possible motivations, mineral rights, and the possible whereabouts of Katherine, it is revealed that Kitty and Katherine are the same person. Kitty had never suspected that her husband is dying. In order to prove premeditation, passion, and perhaps even connections to a woman long missing, seemingly everyone wants the recording, which Gittes refuses to give up until the day of the inquest. Somehow, Gittes edits the recording, leaving Katherine's name chopped out of the dialog, shooting, and aftermath of Bodine's murder. This makes the inquest a short, satisfying meeting where the judge has no reason to suspect murder, and Berman is now free of criminal charges. Confronted with the knowledge Gittes has of his terminal illness, Berman, knowing the model house he is in is filled with natural gas, convinces Gittes and Mickey to leave him alone in the house so he can \\"have a smoke.\\" He doesn't want an autopsy to interfere with Kitty's inheritance. As they drive off, the house explodes. The story ends with Kitty and Gittes in his office. They speak of regrets, and Kitty kisses Gittes, who rejects her advances, saying \\"That's your problem, kid. You don't know who you're kidding.\\" She leaves, telling him to \\"Think of me time to time\\". Gittes tells her \\"It never goes away.\\" Cast * Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes * Harvey Keitel as Julius \\"Jake\\" Berman * Meg Tilly as Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Berman * Madeleine Stowe as Lillian Bodine * Eli Wallach as Cotton Weinberger * Rub√©n Blades as Michael \\"Mickey Nice\\" Weisskopf * Frederic Forrest as Chuck Newty * David Keith as Det.

Producer Robert Evans had the rights to a Chinatown sequel, and in 1976 had negotiated for Jack Nicholson to reprise his role and Dustin Hoffman to act alongside him; that version eventually fell through. Screenwriter Robert Towne finished the script for The Two Jakes in 1984 and was set to direct (original director Roman Polanski had fled the States due to his guilty plea of unlawful sex with a minor and thus would be unable to return), but he objected to Evans' wish to act in the film in the Jake Berman role. Nicholson, Evans, and Towne had formed their own production company to make the film independently, and entered into a distribution deal with Paramount Pictures. The trio agreed to not take up-front salaries, and instead share in the film's profits. Paramount greenlit a $12-13 million budget, and capped its distribution fee at $6 million. In April 1985, Kelly McGillis, Cathy Moriarty, Dennis Hopper, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel had all been cast, ready to shoot the film that month. The following month, the sets had been built and filming was ready to begin, but Towne's lack of confidence in Evans' acting ability exploded into a final argument when Evans objected to having to get a 1940s-style haircut (mostly due to recent plastic surgery scars that would be visible). Filming was scheduled to begin four days after the confrontation, with a witness telling Vanity Fair: \\"In the morning, nothing happened. They said the weather was wrong. But you could tell the plug had been pulled.\\" On top of existing problems between Nicholson, Towne, and Evans, grievances were filed by 120 crew members who had not been paid (over $500,000 from Screen Actors Guild and Directors Guild of America members, and $1.5 million from suppliers of sets, props, costumes, and sound stages), and the project was officially postponed indefinitely. Because the film hadn't been budgeted normally due to the initial Evans-Towne-Nicholson plan, Towne approached producer Dino De Laurentiis to help finance. McGillis remained in the cast, with Harrison Ford set to take over as Jake Gittes and Roy Scheider attached to play the other Jake, with a tentative start date of mid-1986. At one point the original film's star John Huston was rumored to be brought in as director, although Towne denied the claim. However the constant shuffling worried Paramount, who withdrew from the distribution deal out of nervousness, eventually taking a $4 million loss on the film. The project was discontinued until the late 1980s when Nicholson took on the responsibility of directing and also rewrote parts of Towne's script (which \\"was really only about 80% ready\\"). Filming began in Los Angeles on April 18, 1989, lasting through July 26. Numerous scenes had to be reshot after initial filming had wrapped, causing the release date to get pushed from Christmas 1989 to its August 1990 date, however Nicholson insisted that it came in \\"perfectly on schedule and perfectly on budget\\" (the final cost was about $25 million). The film ended up in a personal fallout between Nicholson, Towne, and Evans, with Towne saying in 1998 that he hadn't spoken to Nicholson in over ten years, and Evans checking into a hospital for mental health and substance abuse issues. Reception Box office = Unlike its predecessor, the film was not a box-office success. It made $3.7 million from 1,206 theaters in its first weekend, finishing in seventh, then $1.8 million and $1.9 million in its second and third weekends, finishing 16th both times; it ended its theatrical run with $10 million at the box office, nearly a third less than the original. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 5.87/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that \\"every scene falls into place like clockwork [...] exquisite\\". Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, called it \\"an enjoyable if clunky movie\\". Variety called the film \\"a jumbled, obtuse yet not entirely unsatisfying follow-up to Chinatown\\". Desson Howe, for The Washington Post, wrote that \\"at best, the movie comes across as a competently assembled job, a wistful tribute to its former self. At worst, it's wordy, confusing and ‚Äì here's an ugly word ‚Äì boring\\". Cancelled sequel Screenwriter Robert Towne originally planned a trilogy involving private investigator J.J. Gittes. According to Nicholson, the third film, titled Gittes vs. Gittes, was \\"meant to be set in 1968 when no-fault divorce went into effect in California.\\" However, after The Two Jakes was a commercial failure, plans for a third film were scrapped.

Two small populations were also found on Cebu Island in the Philippines. Like other bare-backed fruit bats, its wings meet along the midline of their bodies, making it a very agile flier. It roosted in caves, in areas where little light penetrated the gloom. It was so abundant once that it left piles of guano, which were used by miners as fertiliser. By the mid-1980s, the lowland forest was replaced by sugar cane plantations and the bat vanished. In 1996 the species was declared extinct by the IUCN, as none had been sighted since 1964, but the bat was rediscovered in 2000. The species now survives in very small numbers. The bat lives in caves and comes out at night to eat fruits from local rainforests. After the forests were cut down to make way for sugar plantations the bat population dropped drastically, and the few remaining ones are still hunted for their meat. Now the bats reside in the few areas of remaining forest, and if these are cut down, the species is likely to go extinct. The forest where the bats live in Cebu is protected in that it cannot be cut down, but there are no conservation measures on Negros. Physical description Dobsonia chapmani is a large fruit bat that lives in Southeastern Asia in the Philippines and the surrounding islands.Johanna Hamburger (2010-10-25) Petition to list 15 bat species under the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1531 et seq.). wildearthguardians.org It measures 218‚Äì221 mm from nose to tail and weighs 125‚Äì143 g. The wings of this bat connect to the midline of the back giving it a naked/furless appearance.Synopsis of Philippine Mammals. The Field Museum (2010) Group size The density of this species is unknown; in the past, the size of the colonies would rarely exceed 300-400 individuals.Theodore Fleming and Paul Racey (2010) ‚ÄúIsland Bats: Evolution, Ecology, and Conservation.‚Äù University Of Chicago Press Habitat The bat prefers limestone caves in the forest. The forest habitats, consist of naturally open and shrubby native vegetation such as: batino (Alstonia macrophylla), hindunganon (Macaranga sp.), tubug (Ficus septica), and matamban (Mallotus sp.), which grow on steep slopes. For food, the bat also utilizes the surrounding agricultural clearings that are planted with abac√° (Musa textiles), gabi (Colocasia esculenta), and coconuts (Cocos nucifera). Only about 60 ha. remain of forested land for this species, all of which is outside of the protected Central Cebu National Park. Diet As the name implies this species eats many kinds of fruit, so they act as an important species for seed dispersal. Major threats Until only a few years ago this species was thought to be extinct due to three common threats. The first is overharvesting of these bats for meat due to their large size.Errol Abada Gatumbato (2010-07-26) Threatened habitats and species in southern Negros Occidental The second and most devastating threat is deforestation, which is inevitable because of the growing human population. The last factor is no measures are taken to protect the habitat of this species, except for a few minor areas in the Carmen municipality.Utzurrum, R. C. B. (1992) ‚ÄúConservation status of Philippine fruit bats‚Äù Secondary threats *Climate change may disrupt breeding seasons and affect the limited habitat of this bat. *Genetic diversity due to the population bottleneck that occurs at low population density.L.-M. J., Pedregosa M. G. and Rabor Paguntalan (1952) ‚ÄúThe Philippine Bare-Backed Fruit Bat Dobsonia chapmani‚Äù Conservation efforts In the Carmen municipality on Cebu Island the local government has formed a group of environmental protection coordinators who patrol and report violations in the habitat of the Philippines naked backed fruit bat. The duty of these coordinators is to survey cave \\"sanctuaries\\", as named by the municipal government, and report changes in the habitat and hunting of bats. A reforestation project is underway as well. Many other towns are following in Carmen‚Äôs footsteps by becoming proactive in saving this bat. There is also a law that applies to both of the islands, which is the Republic Act 9147 or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act. This Act, among other objectives, conserves and protects wildlife and their habitat.This species is also known as a flagship species in many areas in which it lives. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation.

Its mother church is the Cathedral of the Madeleine in Salt Lake City and it is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of San Francisco. On January 10, 2017, Pope Francis appointed Most Rev. Oscar Azarcon Solis, then an Auxiliary Bishop of Los Angeles, the 10th Bishop of Salt Lake City.  Statistics and extent  As per 2014, it pastorally served 291,000 Catholics (10.0% of 2,900,872 total) on 219,887 km¬≤ in 48 parishes with 69 priests (62 diocesan, 7 religious), 75 deacons, 43 lay religious (14 brothers, 29 sisters) and 7 seminarians.http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/salt1.htm It comprises the entire state of Utah.  History  In 1871 Fr. Patrick Walsh built the first Catholic Church in Utah, dedicating it to St. Mary Magdalene. Father (later Bishop) Lawrence Scanlan arrived in 1873 to become pastor. He took care of the Catholic military men, immigrant miners and railroad workers who numbered in the hundreds. Small churches, schools, an orphanage and a hospital were built, staffed by clergy and by the Sisters of the Holy Cross, to serve the growing Catholic population. As the nineteenth century came to a close, the Catholic community in Salt Lake City was rapidly outgrowing the small church of St. Mary Magdalene. In 1887 the Church in Utah became the Apostolic Vicariate of Utah, on territory split off from its metropolitan diocese, the Archdiocese of San Francisco. Ground was broken for the new church in 1899. Construction for the Cathedral of the Madeleine would last nearly a decade, costing a small fortune for the estimated 3,000 Catholics in Utah at the turn of the century. Assistance was obtained from Catholic Mission Societies. On January 27, 1891 it was renamed the Diocese of Salt Lake and on March 27, 1931 it lost territory to establish the Diocese of Reno. Finally, on March 31, 1951 it was renamed the Diocese of Salt Lake City.

It lies in the former province of Quercy. RocamadourThe \\"roc or rocca of Amadour\\". has attracted visitors for its setting in a gorge above a tributary of the River Dordogne, and especially for its historical monuments and its sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which for centuries has attracted pilgrims from many countries, among them kings, bishops, and nobles.The modern account is J. Rocacher, Rocamadour et son p√®lerinage: √©tude historique et arch√©ologique, 2 vols. (Toulouse) 1979. The town below the complex of monastic buildings and pilgrimage churches, traditionally dependent on the pilgrimage site and now on the tourist trade, lies near the river on the lowest slopes; it gives its name to Rocamadour, a small goat's-milk cheese that was awarded AOC status in 1996. GeographyLocation and access= Rocamadour is located in the Lot department in the far north of the Occitanie region. Close to P√©rigord and the Dordogne valley, Rocamadour is at the heart of the Parc Naturel R√©gional des Causses du Quercy, a regional national park. Rocamadour is located 36 km NNE of Cahors by road. It is located on the right bank of the Alzou. Rocamadour can be reached by car from the A20 autoroute, or by train: Gare de Rocamadour-Padirac on the Brive-la-Gaillarde‚ÄìToulouse (via Capdenac) railway. Rocamadour is served by two regional airports that provide easy access to the Dordogne Valley. The A√©roport Brive Vall√©e de la Dordogne (BVE) is located only a few kilometres from many of the region's star attractions whilst the A√©roport Bergerac Dordogne P√©rigord (EGC) is situated just 6 km south of Bergerac. =Hamlets= The territory of the commune of Rocamadour includes several hamlets: L'Hospitalet, Les Alix, Blanat, Mas de Douze, Fouysselaze, Mag√®s, La Fage, La Gardelle, Chez Langle, La Vitalie, Mayrinhac-le-Francal. Toponymy The ancient forms of Rocamadour are Rocamador from 968, Rupis Amatoris in 1186. According to Dauzat, the toponym comes from the name of a saint, Amator. According to Gaston Bazalgues, the toponym Rocamadour is a medieval form which originates from Rocamajor. Roca pointed to a rock shelter and major spoke of its importance. This name would have been Christianized from 1166 with the invention of the false hagiotoponym Saint Amadour or Saint Amateur. In 1473, according to the monograph of Edmond Albe, the place was named the castling of Saint Amadour. In 1618, on a map of the diocese of Cahors by Jean Tarde, the name of Roquemadour appeared. In 1166, the relics of Saint Amadour would have been discovered: a perfectly preserved body was buried in the heart of the Virgin Mary sanctuary, in front of the entrance to the miraculous chapel. The body of Saint Amadour was taken out of the ground and then exposed to the pilgrims. The body was burned during the Wars of Religion and today only fragments of bone remain, presently on view in the crypt of Saint-Amadour. The locality L'Hospitalet, overlooking Rocamadour, has a name from espitalet which meant small hospital and has Latin origin hospitalis. This reception center was founded in 1095 by Dame H√©l√®ne de Castelnau. Sights Alleged fragment of Durandal in Rocamadour Rocamadour was a dependency of the abbey of Tulle to the north in the Bas Limousin. The buildings of Rocamadour (from r√≤ca, cliff, and sant Amador) rise in stages up the side of a cliff on the right bank of the Alzou, which here runs between rocky walls in height. Flights of steps ascend from the lower town to the churches, a group of massive buildings half-way up the cliff. The chief of them is the pilgrimage church of Notre Dame (rebuilt in its present configuration from 1479), containing the cult image at the centre of the site's draw, a wooden Black Madonna reputed to have been carved by Saint Amator (Amadour) himself. The small Benedictine community continued to reserve to itself the use of the small twelfth-century church of Saint-Michel, above and to the side. Below, the pilgrimage church opens onto a terrace where pilgrims could assemble, called the Plateau of St Michel, where there is a broken sword said to be a fragment of Durandal, once wielded by the hero Roland. The interior walls of the church of St Sauveur are covered, with paintings and inscriptions recalling the pilgrimages of celebrated persons. The subterranean church of St Amadour (1166) extends beneath St Sauveur and contains relics of the saint. On the summit of the cliff stands the ch√¢teau built in the Middle Ages to defend the sanctuaries. History Rocamadour =Prehistory= Rocamadour and its many caves already housed men in the Paleolithic as shown in the cave drawings of the Grotte des Merveilles. The Grotte de Linars cave and its porch served as an underground necropolis and a habitat in the Bronze Age. The vestiges are deposited in the museum at Cabrerets and at the town hall in Rocamadour. During the Iron Age, the Cadurques people arrived from middle Germany. In the eighth century BC., they colonised the current Lot department, using their iron weapons. The remains of a village, in the Salvate valley near Couzou, were found during work. An oppidum perched on the heights of the Alzou valley, downstream from Tournefeuille, is perhaps linked to the fight of the Gauls against the Roman troops during the Gallic war. =Middle ages=The beginnings and the influence The three levels of the village of Rocamadour date from the Middle Ages, and they reflect the three orders of society: the knights above, linked to religious clerics in the middle and the lay workers down near the river. Rare documents mention that in 1105 a small chapel was built in a shelter of the cliff at a place called Rupis Amatoris, at the limit of the territories of the Benedictine abbeys of Saint-Martin at Tulle and Saint- Pierre at Marcilhac-sur-C√©l√©. In 1112, Eble de Turenne, Abbot of Tulle settled in Rocamadour. In 1119, the first donation was made by Eudes, Comte de la Marche. In 1148, a first miracle was announced. The pilgrimage to the Virgin Mary attracted crowds. The statue of the Black Madonna is dated from the 12th century. G√©raud d'Escorailles, abbot from 1152 to 1188, built the religious buildings, financed by donations from visitors. The works were finished at the end of the 12th century. Rocamadour already enjoyed European fame as evidenced by the 12th century book Livre des Miracles written by a monk from the sanctuary and received many pilgrims. In 1159, Henry II of England, husband of Eleanor of Aquitaine came to Rocamadour to thank the Virgin for her healing. In 1166, wanting to bury a resident, they discovered an intact body, presented as that of Saint Amadour. Rocamadour had found its saint. At least four stories, more or less tinged with legend, presented Saint Amadour as a personage close to Jesus. In 1211, the pontifical legate during the Albigensian Crusade, Arnaud Amalric, came to spend the winter in Rocamadour. In addition, in 1291, Pope Nicholas IV granted three bulls and forty day indulgences for site visitors. The end of the 13th century saw the height of Rocamadour's influence and the completion of the constructions. The castle was protected by three towers, a wide moat and numerous lookouts. Decline In 1317, the monks left Rocamadour. The site was then administered by a chapter of canons appointed by the bishop. In the fourteenth century, a cooling climate, famines, epidemics like the black plague ravaged Europe. In 1427, reconstruction was started, but without financial or human resources. A huge rock crushed the Notre-Dame chapel which was rebuilt in 1479 by Denys de Bar, Bishop of Tulle. Subsequently, during the French Wars of Religion, the iconoclastic passage of Protestant mercenaries in 1562 caused the destruction of religious buildings and their relics. The canons describe, in a petition to Pope Pius IV in 1563, the damage caused: ‚ÄúThey have, oh pain! all trashed; they burned and looted its statues and paintings, its bells, its ornaments and jewels, all that was necessary for divine worship ... ‚Äù. The relics are desecrated and destroyed, including the body of Saint Amadour. According to witnesses, the Protestant Captain Jean Bessonia broke it with the smith's hammer, saying: \\"I am going to break you, since you did not want to burn\\". Captain's Bessonie and Duras would draw, for the benefit of the Prince of Cond√©'s army, the sum of 20,000 pounds from everything that made up the treasure of Notre-Dame since the 12th century. The site was again looted during the French Revolution. Pilgrimage A legend supposed to explain the origin of this pilgrimage has given rise to controversies between critical and traditional schools, especially in recent times. A vehicle by which the legend was disseminated and pilgrims drawn to the site was The Miracles of Our Lady of Rocamadour, written ca. 1172,Marcus Graham Bull, The Miracles of Our Lady of Rocamadour: Analysis and Translation (1999) justifies his dating of 1172 and 1173 (for book III), an uncharacteristically rapid assembly of miracle accounts, which were commonly assembled over decades (p. 27); the collection contains 126 miracles in three books. an example of the miracula, or books of collected miracles, which had such a wide audience in the Middle Ages. According to the founding legend, Rocamadour is named after the founder of the ancient sanctuary, Saint Amator, identified with the Biblical Zacheus, the tax collector of Jericho mentioned in Luke 19:1-10, and the husband of St. Veronica, who wiped Jesus' face on the way to Calvary. Driven out of Palestine by persecution, St. Amadour and St. Veronica embarked in a frail skiff and, guided by an angel, landed on the coast of Aquitaine, where they met Bishop St. Martial, another disciple of Christ who was preaching the Gospel in the south-west of Gaul. After journeying to Rome, where he witnessed the martyrdoms of St Peter and St Paul, Amadour, having returned to France, on the death of his spouse, withdrew to a wild spot in Quercy where he built a chapel in honour of the Blessed Virgin, near which he died a little later.Clugnet, L√©on. \\"Rocamadour.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 27 Apr. 2013 This account, like most other similar legends, does not make its first appearance till long after the age in which the chief actors are deemed to have lived. The name of Amadour occurs in no document previous to the compilation of his Acts, which on careful examination and on an application of the rules of the cursus to the text cannot be judged older than the 12th century. It is now well established that Saint Martial, Amadour's contemporary in the legend, lived in the 3rd not the 1st century, and Rome has never included him among the members of the Apostolic College. The mention, therefore, of St Martial in the \\"Acts of St Amadour\\" would alone suffice, even if other proof were wanting, to prove them doubtful. The untrustworthiness of the legend has led some recent authors to suggest that Amadour was an unknown hermit or possibly St. Amator, Bishop of Auxerre, but this is mere hypothesis, without any historical basis. The origin of the sanctuary of Rocamadour, lost in antiquity, is thus set down along with fabulous traditions which cannot bear up to sound criticism. After the religious manifestations of the Middle Ages, Rocamadour, as a result of war and the French Revolution, had become almost deserted. In the mid-nineteenth century, owing to the zeal and activity of the bishops of Cahors, it seems to have revived. Rocamadour is classed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as part of the St James‚Äô Way pilgrimage route.\\"Rocamadour\\", France Guide, French Government Tourist Office =Cultural references= The statue of the venerated Black Virgin In her book-length poem, \\"Solitude,\\" Vita Sackville- West uses Rocamadour in her dedication, as site and setting for inspiration. The composer Francis Poulenc wrote in 1936 Litanies √† la Vierge Noire (Litanies to the Black Virgin) after a pilgrimage to the shrine. Rocamadour inspired 20th-century Latin American novelists Julio Cort√°zar and Giannina Brashi who lived in France for some time and wrote in Spanish about immigrants, expatriates, and tourists. In Cortazar's opus \\"Hopscotch\\", the sad heroine La Maga has a baby boy named Rocamadour who dies in his sleep. The dead baby Rocamadour is also a character in Giannina Braschi's novel \\"Yo-Yo Boing!\\". Rocamadour is mentioned in Michel Houellebecq book Soumission (2015). =Famous pilgrims= *Roland *Eleanor of Aquitaine *Henry II of England *Blanche of Castile *Louis IX of France *Charles IV of France *Louis XI of France *Jacques Cartier.

Examples  * If f(x)=x_1^2+\\\\cdots+x_n^2 \\\\, then ::\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\partial_i^2 f(x)^{s+1} = 4(s+1)\\\\left(s+\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\right)f(x)^s :so the Bernstein‚ÄìSato polynomial is ::b(s)=(s+1)\\\\left(s+\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\right). * If f(x)=x_1^{n_1}x_2^{n_2}\\\\cdots x_r^{n_r} then ::\\\\prod_{j=1}^r\\\\partial_{x_j}^{n_j}\\\\quad f(x)^{s+1} =\\\\prod_{j=1}^r\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n_j}(n_js+i)\\\\quad f(x)^s :so ::b(s)=\\\\prod_{j=1}^r\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n_j}\\\\left(s+\\\\frac{i}{n_j}\\\\right). * The Bernstein‚ÄìSato polynomial of x2 + y3 is ::(s+1)\\\\left(s+\\\\frac{5}{6}\\\\right)\\\\left(s+\\\\frac{7}{6}\\\\right). *If tij are n2 variables, then the Bernstein‚ÄìSato polynomial of det(tij) is given by ::s(s+1)\\\\cdots(s+n-1) :which follows from ::\\\\Omega(\\\\det(t_{ij})^s) = s(s+1)\\\\cdots(s+n-1)\\\\det(t_{ij})^{s-1} :where Œ© is Cayley's omega process, which in turn follows from the Capelli identity.  Applications  * If f(x) is a non-negative polynomial then f(x)^s, initially defined for s with non- negative real part, can be analytically continued to a meromorphic distribution-valued function of s by repeatedly using the functional equation ::f(x)^s={1\\\\over b(s)} P(s)f(x)^{s+1}. :It may have poles whenever b(s + n) is zero for a non-negative integer n. * If f(x) is a polynomial, not identically zero, then it has an inverse g that is a distribution;Warning: The inverse is not unique in general, because if f has zeros then there are distributions whose product with f is zero, and adding one of these to an inverse of f is another inverse of f. in other words, f g = 1 as distributions. If f(x) is non-negative the inverse can be constructed using the Bernstein‚ÄìSato polynomial by taking the constant term of the Laurent expansion of f(x)s at s = ‚àí1\\\\. For arbitrary f(x) just take \\\\bar f(x) times the inverse of \\\\bar f(x)f(x). * The Malgrange‚ÄìEhrenpreis theorem states that every differential operator with constant coefficients has a Green's function. By taking Fourier transforms this follows from the fact that every polynomial has a distributional inverse, which is proved in the paragraph above. * showed how to use the Bernstein polynomial to define dimensional regularization rigorously, in the massive Euclidean case. * The Bernstein-Sato functional equation is used in computations of some of the more complex kinds of singular integrals occurring in quantum field theory . Such computations are needed for precision measurements in elementary particle physics as practiced for instance at CERN (see the papers citing ). However, the most interesting cases require a simple generalization of the Bernstein-Sato functional equation to the product of two polynomials (f_1(x))^{s_1}(f_2(x))^{s_2}, with x having 2-6 scalar components, and the pair of polynomials having orders 2 and 3. Unfortunately, a brute force determination of the corresponding differential operators P(s_1,s_2) and b(s_1,s_2) for such cases has so far proved prohibitively cumbersome. Devising ways to bypass the combinatorial explosion of the brute force algorithm would be of great value in such applications.

For most of its run, it was broadcast in the morning, Monday through Friday, and usually live. History The Wallace and Ladmo Show ran more than 35 years‚Äîmaking it one of the longest-running, daily, locally produced children's television shows in American broadcasting. It premiered as It's Wallace?, a vehicle to showcase cartoons for KPHO in January 1954. The show was hosted by Bill Thompson, who created the character of Wallace Snead when he appeared on the Golddust Charlie Show (also on KPHO). It aired on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at 6:30 PM. Within a year, Ladimir Kwiatkowski (who had been a cameraman for the station) joined the show as Ladmo, the rubber-faced sidekick to Wallace. In 1960, Pat McMahon joined the cast and developed a list of characters (such as Gerald, Aunt Maud, Captain Super and Marshall Good) that parodied various popular culture icons. (McMahon remains a popular talk radio personality for KTAR in the Phoenix market.) In addition to the daily broadcasts, the cast of the show performed regular stage shows at such venues as local movie theaters and malls, Encanto Park (in central Phoenix), and the Legend City theme park. In 1968 the show was renamed Wallace & Company and again in 1970, to its better known title, The Wallace & Ladmo Show. In 1973, the time slot of the show split with a morning and afternoon show but taping of the two shows was still in the afternoon so children could attend the audience after school. The show ended with the final taping on December 29, 1989. By that time it had won many awards, including nine regional Emmy awards. KAZT-TV (Channel 7.1 in Prescott and Phoenix) has periodically aired reruns of The Wallace and Ladmo Show. Ladmo Bags A Ladmo Bag In the mid-1960s, the Ladmo Bag first appeared on the show. Prior to this, children who were winners of one of the many ongoing contests run by the program, were invited on the show to pick a prize from the \\"Toy Cottage\\". Often they would have a difficult time choosing which prize they wanted, leading to delays and slowing the pace of the show. Wallace credits Pat McMahon with coming up with the idea, of putting items from the show's sponsors in a bag, and giving that to the winner instead. The Ladmo Bag could also be won by children in the in-studio audience or at stage performances. They were paper grocery bags filled with candy, potato chips, cans of soda, assorted coupons and so on. To Wallace and Ladmo fans and collectors, an authentic Ladmo Bag from the original show can be worth a considerable amount of money. However, very few of these bags still exist intact, as most children that won the prizes consumed the content inside and discarded the bag. Some natives of the Phoenix area use the expression \\"I never got a Ladmo Bag when I was a kid\\" as a metaphor for \\"I had a deprived childhood.\\" The last Ladmo bag, on the final telecast, was given to Wallace in a symbolic gesture by Ladmo. Although Kwiatkowski died on Wednesday March 2, 1994, select people attending events like the Arizona State Fair would still win Ladmo bags as recently as 2014. Bill Thompson (Wallace) died on July 23, 2014. In 2015, Pat McMahon revealed that the seating chart, ostensibly used to determine the winner of the Ladmo Bag during the show, was actually a blank sheet of paper. According to McMahon, Wallace would simply choose a seat at random. Inmates of the Maricopa County jail have been known to call the bags of food given to them as \\"Ladmo Bags\\". Plays In recent years there have been two plays written about the show. The first play follows Wallace, Ladmo, Pat and Mike Condello as they struggle to hold the show together when the parody band, Hub Kapp and the Wheels, is offered a record deal with Capitol Records. The second play deals with the death of Ladmo from cancer. The first play was performed two times at the Herberger Theater Center in downtown Phoenix, with several celebrities showing up as \\"Time Machine\\" guests, including Alice Cooper. The plays were all written by Ben Tyler with input from both Thompson and McMahon. Museum exhibits The Wallace and Ladmo Show has been the subject of several museum exhibits over the years. In 2009, two different exhibits about the show's history were on view: one at the Arizona Historical Society in Tempe (AHS has over 2,500 Wallace and Ladmo items in their collection), and the other at the Mesa Historical Museum. There is also a permanent exhibit in the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix. Legacy a mural featuring Wallace, Gerald, and Ladmo On April 1, 2015, the show's 61st anniversary, the creation of The Wallace and Ladmo Foundation was announced. The goal of the foundation is to support Arizona children in the performing arts.

He has starred in various theatre productions such as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Conduct Unbecoming, Heinous Crimes and Other Delights, The Greenhouse Effect and Remote Evolution. Henson was born with a white streak of hair on the right side of his head. As a result, he received the nickname \\"Skunk Boy\\" while hosting Talk Soup. Education Henson attended St. Luke's School in New Canaan, Connecticut. Career Henson began his career as a stand-up comic. He started appearing in films in the mid to late 1990s. He was the longest-running host (four years) of Talk Soup on the E! Entertainment Network, hosting just over 1,000 shows in the four and a half years he was with the network. During his stint as host of Talk Soup, he appeared as a guest on Space Ghost Coast to Coast. In 2004, he was the host of The John Henson Project, a short-lived comedy-reality show on Spike TV, and hosted several broadcast specials including ABC's Best Commercials You've Never Seen, ABC's Best TV You've Never Seen and, most recently, the 33rd Annual Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. From 2005 to 2007, Henson was the co-host of Watch This!, a daily television show on the TV Guide Channel.

Similarly, it marked the end of an era for the band, as it was the last album by the Mountain Goats to feature only John Darnielle until 2020. The cover states that the album consists of \\"fourteen songs about seven people, two houses, a motorcycle, and a locked treatment facility for adolescent boys.\\" Many of the songs explicitly refer to places in Texas, and evoke a lifestyle ethos born of the vast expanses of desert and highway found in West Texas itself. Several songs were written to appear on the record that were not included in its final version. Three were given away on the Tiny Mix Tapes website (\\"Song for God\\", \\"Warm Lonely Planet\\", and \\"Waco\\"). Darnielle said there was a full set of fifteen outtakes that he intended to release for free one day, but he destroyed them after hearing about the leak of Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg. It is not known whether that set included the three listed above. When the promotional copies of this album were sent out, a unique General Highway Map of a part of West Texas was included in the mailing. Apparently, this was not acknowledged by any of the critics who received it.Letter from Craig Stewart of Emperor Jones Records dated 18 August 2004 In May 2013, Darnielle announced that Merge Records would reissue All Hail West Texas on July 23 of that year, on vinyl for the first time. The announcement included a link to an explanatory essay by Matt Fraction. The reissue includes remastered versions of the original recordings, seven previously unreleased tracks contemporary to the original album, and a new 1,800-word essay by Darnielle about the album and his writing process. Reception All Hail West Texas was well received by critics compared to other albums created by the Mountain Goats. Critics point out the use of the Panasonic RX-FT500 and how the album had a more raw sound than a studio recording. It is also mentioned that the \\"wheel grind\\" of the tape recorder itself is heard throughout the album. Some of the album's critics hold that the general direction of the album is hard to follow.

Gulf of the Ganges (Bay of Bengal) left, Southeast Asian peninsula in the center, South China Sea right, with \\"Sinae\\" (China). The Ptolemy world map is a map of the world known to Hellenistic society in the 2nd century. It is based on the description contained in Ptolemy's book Geography, written . Based on an inscription in several of the earliest surviving manuscripts, it is traditionally credited to Agathodaemon of Alexandria. Significant contributions of Ptolemy's map is the first use of longitudinal and latitudinal lines as well as specifying terrestrial locations by celestial observations. The Geography was translated from Greek into Arabic in the 9th century and played a role in the work of al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ before lapsing into obscurity. The idea of a global coordinate system revolutionized European geographical thought, however, and inspired more mathematical treatment of cartography. Ptolemy's work probably originally came with maps, but none have been discovered. Instead, the present form of the map was reconstructed from Ptolemy's coordinates by Byzantine monks under the direction of Maximus Planudes shortly after 1295. It probably was not that of the original text, as it uses the less favored of the two alternate projections offered by Ptolemy. Continents The continents are given as Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa). The World Ocean is only seen to the west. The map distinguishes two large enclosed seas: the Mediterranean and the Indian (Indicum Pelagus). Due to Marinus and Ptolemy's mistaken measure of the circumference of the earth, the former is made to extend much too far in terms of degrees of arc; due to their reliance on Hipparchus, they mistakenly enclose the latter with an eastern and southern shore of unknown lands, which prevents the map from identifying the western coast of the World Ocean. India is bound by the Indus and Ganges Rivers, but its peninsula is much shortened. Instead, Ceylon (Taprobane) is greatly enlarged. The Malay Peninsula is given as the Golden Chersonese instead of the earlier \\"Golden Island\\", which derived from Indian accounts of the mines on Sumatra. Beyond the Golden Chersonese, the Great Gulf (Magnus Sinus) forms a combination of the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea which is bound by the unknown lands thought to enclose the Indian Sea. China is divided into two realms‚Äîthe Qin (Sinae) and the Land of Silk (Serica)‚Äîowing to the different accounts received from the overland and maritime Silk Roads. The Geography and the map derived from it probably played an important role in the expansion of the Roman Empire to the East. Trade throughout the Indian Ocean was extensive from the 2nd century, and many Roman trading ports have been identified in India. From these ports, Roman embassies to China are recorded in Chinese historical sources from around 166. The Danish historian Gudmund Sch√ºtte attempted to reconstruct the Danish part of Ptolemy's world map. It includes several place- and tribe-names, some of which Sch√ºtte assigned a contemporary equivalent. The most prominent feature of the map is the peninsula Jutland placed north of the river Albis Tr√™va, west of the Saxon√¥n Nes√¥i (archipelago), east of the Skandiai N√™soi, which itself lies west of a larger island Skandia. Skandia is home to the Goutai in the center, and the Phiraisoi in the east. North of Jutland lies a third archipelago Alokiai N√™soi. South of the Albis live the Lakkobardoi and to its north the Saxones. The west coast of Jutland is home to the Sigul√¥nes, the Sabaliggio, the Kobandoi, the Eundusioi and the northernmost Kimbroi (possibly Cimbri). The center and east is home to the Kimbrik√™ (possibly Cimbri), the Cherson√™sos and the Charudes.Jernalderen, Turistforeningen for Danmark, √Örbog 1961, redigeret af Kristjan Bure, 1961.

It is the microscopic reverse of oxidative addition, and is often the product-forming step in many catalytic processes. Since oxidative addition and reductive elimination are reverse reactions, the same mechanisms apply for both processes, and the product equilibrium depends on the thermodynamics of both directions.  General information  Reductive elimination is often seen in higher oxidation states, and can involve a two- electron change at a single metal center (mononuclear) or a one-electron change at each of two metal centers (binuclear, dinuclear, or bimetallic). center For mononuclear reductive elimination, the oxidation state of the metal decreases by two, while the d-electron count of the metal increases by two. This pathway is common for d8 metals Ni(II), Pd(II), and Au(III) and d6 metals Pt(IV), Pd(IV), Ir(III), and Rh(III). Additionally, mononuclear reductive elimination requires that the groups being eliminated must be cis to one another on the metal center. center For binuclear reductive elimination, the oxidation state of each metal decreases by one, while the d-electron count of each metal increases by one. This type of reactivity is generally seen with first row metals, which prefer a one-unit change in oxidation state, but has been observed in both second and third row metals. center  Mechanisms  As with oxidative addition, several mechanisms are possible with reductive elimination. The prominent mechanism is a concerted pathway, meaning that it is a nonpolar, three-centered transition state with retention of stereochemistry. In addition, an SN2 mechanism, which proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry, or a radical mechanism, which proceeds with obliteration of stereochemistry, are other possible pathways for reductive elimination. = Octahedral complexes = The rate of reductive elimination is greatly influenced by the geometry of the metal complex. In octahedral complexes, reductive elimination can be very slow from the coordinatively saturated center, and often, reductive elimination only proceeds via a dissociative mechanism, where a ligand must initially dissociate to make a five-coordinate complex. This complex adopts a Y-type distorted trigonal bipyramidal structure where a œÄ-donor ligand is at the basal position and the two groups to be eliminated are brought very close together. After elimination, a T-shaped three-coordinate complex is formed, which will associate with a ligand to form the square planar four-coordinate complex. center = Square planar complexes = Reductive elimination of square planar complexes can progress through a variety of mechanisms: dissociative, nondissociative, and associative. Similar to octahedral complexes, a dissociative mechanism for square planar complexes initiates with loss of a ligand, generating a three-coordinate intermediate that undergoes reductive elimination to produce a one-coordinate metal complex. For a nondissociative pathway, reductive elimination occurs from the four-coordinate system to afford a two-coordinate complex. If the eliminating ligands are trans to each other, the complex must first undergo a trans to cis isomerization before eliminating. In an associative mechanism, a ligand must initially associate with the four-coordinate metal complex to generate a five- coordinate complex that undergoes reductive elimination synonymous to the dissociation mechanism for octahedral complexes. center  Factors that affect reductive elimination  Reductive elimination is sensitive to a variety of factors including: 1) metal identity and electron density; 2) sterics; 3) participating ligands; 4) coordination number; 5) geometry; and 6) photolysis/oxidation. Additionally, because reductive elimination and oxidative addition are reverse reactions, any sterics or electronics that enhance the rate of reductive elimination must thermodynamically hinder the rate of oxidative addition. = Metal identity and electron density = First- row metal complexes tend to undergo reductive elimination faster than second- row metal complexes, which tend to be faster than third-row metal complexes. This is due to bond strength, with metal-ligand bonds in first-row complexes being weaker than metal-ligand bonds in third-row complexes. Additionally, electron-poor metal centers undergo reductive elimination faster than electron-rich metal centers since the resulting metal would gain electron density upon reductive elimination. center = Sterics = Reductive elimination generally occurs more rapidly from a more sterically hindered metal center because the steric encumbrance is alleviated upon reductive elimination. Additionally, wide ligand bite angles generally accelerate reductive elimination because the sterics force the eliminating groups closer together, which allows for more orbital overlap. center = Participating ligands = Kinetics for reductive elimination are hard to predict, but reactions that involve hydrides are particularly fast due to effects of orbital overlap in the transition state. center = Coordination number = Reductive elimination occurs more rapidly for complexes of three- or five- coordinate metal centers than for four- or six-coordinate metal centers. For even coordination number complexes, reductive elimination leads to an intermediate with a strongly metal-ligand antibonding orbital. When reductive elimination occurs from odd coordination number complexes, the resulting intermediate occupies a nonbonding molecular orbital. center = Geometry = Reductive elimination generally occurs faster for complexes whose structures resemble the product. = Photolysis/oxidation = Reductive elimination can be induced by oxidizing the metal center to a higher oxidation state via light or an oxidant. center  Applications  Reductive elimination has found widespread application in academia and industry, most notable being hydrogenation, the Monsanto acetic acid process, hydroformylation, and cross- coupling reactions.New Trends in Cross-Coupling: Theory and Applications Thomas Colacot (Editor) 2014 In many of these catalytic cycles, reductive elimination is the product forming step and regenerates the catalyst; however, in the Heck reaction and Wacker process, reductive elimination is involved only in catalyst regeneration, as the products in these reactions are formed via Œ≤‚Äìhydride elimination.

Labinger \\"Tutorial on Oxidative Addition\\" Organometallics, 2015, volume 34, pp 4784‚Äì4795. Oxidative addition is a process that increases both the oxidation state and coordination number of a metal centre. Oxidative addition is often a step in catalytic cycles, in conjunction with its reverse reaction, reductive elimination. Role in transition metal chemistry For transition metals, oxidative reaction results in the decrease in the dn to a configuration with fewer electrons, often 2e fewer. Oxidative addition is favored for metals that are (i) basic and/or (ii) easily oxidized. Metals with a relatively low oxidation state often satisfy one of these requirements, but even high oxidation state metals undergo oxidative addition, as illustrated by the oxidation of Pt(II) with chlorine: :[PtCl4]2‚àí \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí [PtCl6]2‚àí In classical organometallic chemistry, the formal oxidation state of the metal and the electron count of the complex both increase by two. One-electron changes are also possible and in fact some oxidative addition reactions proceed via series of 1e changes. Although oxidative additions can occur with the insertion of a metal into many different substrates, oxidative additions are most commonly seen with H‚ÄìH, H‚ÄìX, and C‚ÄìX bonds because these substrates are most relevant to commercial applications. Oxidative addition requires that the metal complex have a vacant coordination site. For this reason, oxidative additions are common for four- and five-coordinate complexes. Reductive elimination is the reverse of oxidative addition. Reductive elimination is favored when the newly formed X‚ÄìY bond is strong. For reductive elimination to occur the two groups (X and Y) should be mutually adjacent on the metal's coordination sphere. Reductive elimination is the key product-releasing step of several reactions that form C‚ÄìH and C‚ÄìC bonds. Mechanisms of oxidative addition Oxidative additions proceed via many pathways that depend on the metal center and the substrates. =Concerted pathway= Oxidative additions of nonpolar substrates such as hydrogen and hydrocarbons appear to proceed via concerted pathways. Such substrates lack œÄ-bonds, consequently a three-centered œÉ complex is invoked, followed by intramolecular ligand bond cleavage of the ligand (probably by donation of electron pair into the sigma* orbital of the inter ligand bond) to form the oxidized complex. The resulting ligands will be mutually cis, although subsequent isomerization may occur. :400px This mechanism applies to the addition of homonuclear diatomic molecules such as H2. Many C‚ÄìH activation reactions also follow a concerted mechanism through the formation of an M‚Äì(C‚ÄìH) agostic complex. A representative example is the reaction of hydrogen with Vaska's complex, trans-IrCl(CO)[P(C6H5)3]2. In this transformation, iridium changes its formal oxidation state from +1 to +3. The product is formally bound to three anions: one chloride and two hydride ligands. As shown below, the initial metal complex has 16 valence electrons and a coordination number of four whereas the product is a six-coordinate 18 electron complex. :450px Formation of a trigonal bipyramidal dihydrogen intermediate is followed by cleavage of the H‚ÄìH bond, due to electron back donation into the H‚ÄìH œÉ*-orbital. This system is also in chemical equilibrium, with the reverse reaction proceeding by the elimination of hydrogen gas with simultaneous reduction of the metal center. The electron back donation into the H‚ÄìH œÉ*-orbital to cleave the H‚ÄìH bond causes electron-rich metals to favor this reaction. The concerted mechanism produces a cis dihydride, while the stereochemistry of the other oxidative addition pathways do not usually produce cis adducts. =SN2-type= Some oxidative additions proceed analogously to the well known bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions in organic chemistry. Nucleophillic attack by the metal center at the less electronegative atom in the substrate leads to cleavage of the R‚ÄìX bond, to form an [M‚ÄìR]+ species. This step is followed by rapid coordination of the anion to the cationic metal center. For example, reaction of a square planar complex with methyl iodide: :475px This mechanism is often assumed in the addition of polar and electrophilic substrates, such as alkyl halides and halogens. =Ionic= The ionic mechanism of oxidative addition is similar to the SN2 type in that it involves the stepwise addition of two distinct ligand fragments. The key difference being that ionic mechanisms involve substrates which are dissociated in solution prior to any interactions with the metal center. An example of ionic oxidative addition is the addition of hydrochloric acid. =Radical= In addition to undergoing SN2-type reactions, alkyl halides and similar substrates can add to a metal center via a radical mechanism, although some details remain controversial. Reactions which are generally accepted to proceed by a radical mechanism are known however. One example was proposed by Lednor and co-workers. ;Initiation :[(CH3)2C(CN)N]2 ‚Üí 2 (CH3)2(CN)C‚Ä¢ \\\\+ N2 :(CH3)2(CN)C‚Ä¢ \\\\+ PhBr ‚Üí (CH3)2(CN)CBr + Ph‚Ä¢ ;Propagation :Ph‚Ä¢ \\\\+ [Pt(PPh3)2] ‚Üí [Pt(PPh3)2Ph]‚Ä¢ :[Pt(PPh3)2Ph]‚Ä¢ \\\\+ PhBr ‚Üí [Pt(PPh3)2PhBr] + Ph‚Ä¢ Applications Oxidative addition and reductive elimination are invoked in many catalytic processes both in homogeneous catalysis (i.e., in solution) such as the Monsanto process and alkene hydrogenation using Wilkinson's catalyst. It is often suggested that oxidative addition-like reactions are also involved in mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis, e.g. hydrogenation catalyzed by platinum metal. Metals are however characterised by band structures, so oxidation states are not meaningful. Oxidative addition is also needed in order for nucleophilic addition of an alkyl group to occur. Oxidative insertion is also a crucial step in many cross-coupling reactions like the Suzuki coupling, Negishi coupling, and the Sonogashira coupling.

During the 1960s and '70s, he managed the careers of three highly successful musical artists - Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck and Gilbert O'Sullivan. Mills was also a songwriter, penning hits for Cliff Richard, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, Freddie and the Dreamers, the Applejacks, Paul Jones, Peter and Gordon and Tom Jones, most notably co-writing Jones's signature song \\"It's Not Unusual\\" with Les Reed. Biography Mills's parents met and married in British India when his father was serving in the British Army. They returned to Britain shortly after Gordon's birth. An only child, Mills was taught to play the harmonica by his mother, Lorna. At age 15, Mills joined a group playing in pubs and clubs in the South Wales Valleys. At age 17, he was called up for National Service and served in Germany and Malaya. Returning to the UK, he competed in a harmonica championship event organised by Hohner at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He came second, qualifying him to represent the UK in the European final which he then won. Invited to join the Morton Fraser Harmonica Gang, he met musicians Don Paul and Ronnie Wells with whom he formed a trio known as the Viscounts. One song \\"Who Put the Bomp (In the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)\\" (1961) became a minor hit in the UK Singles Chart. Their cover of \\"Short'nin' Bread\\" (1960) also had some earlier success. Mills wrote some songs, with his first \\"I'll Never Get Over You\\", recorded by Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, reaching No. 4 in the UK in 1963. In the space of a year he wrote three more hits \\"Hungry for Love\\", \\"Jealous Girl\\" and \\"Three Little Words\\". \\"I'm the Lonely One\\" gave Cliff Richard and the Shadows a top 10 success in 1964. At a party given by singer Terry Dene, Mills met model Jo Waring and they married two years later. Their daughter Clair, then three years old, became the subject of the 1972 song \\"Clair\\" by Gilbert O'Sullivan. One night, Mills was in Cwmtillery, where Tommy Scott and the Senators were performing, featuring a new young singer with the name of Tom Woodward. Mills eventually became Woodward's manager, after signing a management transfer contract with Tom's joint managers Raymond William Godfrey and Raymond John Glastonbury (Myron & Byron), who had already signed the singer to Decca Records, after terminating their previous recording agreement with Joe Meek of RGM Sound Ltd. Godfrey and Glastonbury retained a 5% interest in Jones, but had to sue Jones and Mills in London's High Court for non fulfilment, finally obtaining a settlement in 1969 for an undisclosed sum. Jones' first single \\"Chills and Fever\\", originally recorded with Joe Meek, was released in late 1964, but was not a hit, and was viewed by some as being over produced. Jones' second attempt was a song turned down by Sandie Shaw. The song was \\"It's Not Unusual\\" which propelled him into the top reaches of the chart. Mills then wanted to break Jones into recording film soundtracks but, after the relative failure of the James Bond theme song \\"Thunderball\\" (UK No. 35), another approach was needed. Mills redesigned the singer's image into that of a crooner. Jones also began to sing material that appealed to a wider audience such as the big country hit \\"Green, Green Grass of Home\\". The strategy worked and Jones returned to the top of the charts in the United Kingdom and began hitting the Top 40 again in the United States. For the remainder of the decade, he scored a string of hits on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1967, Jones performed in Las Vegas for the first time, at the Flamingo. In 1965, Mills started working with Gerry Dorsey, a singer who had been around for a long time without major success, changing his name to Engelbert Humperdinck and with television exposure on a Sunday night in 1967 at the London Palladium, a new star was born. Between 1967 and 1972, Mills had two of the biggest stars in the music industry under his control and he signed female singer/songwriter Lynsey de Paul who had just scored a huge hit with Sugar Me, but by the end of 1973 she had left the label. Mills cleverly renamed a number of famous singers. Tom Woodward became \\"Tom Jones\\" after a suggestion from Godfrey and Glastonbury, who had objected to Decca's plan to call him \\"Scotty\\" in 1965. Mills gave other pop music stars their stage names, such as Engelbert Humperdinck, and Gilbert O'Sullivan. By 1973 however, both Jones's and Humperdinck's record sales had dropped dramatically, but Mills had found new talent with Gilbert O'Sullivan who kept MAM's business booming. Mills also produced O'Sullivan first four albums, spawning notable hits such as \\"Alone Again (Naturally), \\"Clair\\" and \\"Get Down\\". However, when his success started to fade, there was no replacement. By 1978, Jones was reduced to making country albums for the American-only market, Humperdinck had left Mills and O'Sullivan was no longer commercially successful. MAM was taken over by Chrysalis Records. Things turned more sour when O'Sullivan discovered his recording contract with MAM Records greatly favoured the label's owner. O'Sullivan sued his former manager on suspicion of the latter having \\"cooked the books\\", failing to pay O'Sullivan all of his duly earned royalties. A lawsuit followed, with prolonged argument over how much money his songs had earned and how much of that money he had actually received. Eventually, in May 1982, the court found in O'Sullivan's favour, describing him as a \\"patently honest and decent man\\", who had not received a just proportion of the vast income his songs had generated. They awarded him ¬£7 million in damages. Mills died of stomach cancer in 1986, at the age of 51 and is buried in Burvale Cemetery, Hersham.

The high school was closed after nearly 42 years of operation in May 2007. It is now known as Woodham Middle School. Woodham Middle School is now closed and West Florida High School of Advanced Technology and its faculty, staff, and students have transferred over from Longleaf Drive to the old school grounds of Woodham Middle School and is now located there. The school is named for Dr. William Jesse Woodham, Jr., a former Escambia County School District superintendent. Woodham High School was the only high school in Escambia County to have a Law Academy, as well as to have a Future Educators Academy. In addition, Woodham also sported a Health Science Program.  History  Woodham High School was opened in 1965, in response to the tremendous growth of Pensacola's northern suburbs. This move took the pressure off of Pensacola High School, which at the time was suffering from severe overcrowding. Woodham itself also experienced overcrowding in the early-to-mid 1970s as students from Gulf Breeze, Fl. were bused to Woodham before a separate high school was constructed in Gulf Breeze. Woodham students attended split class sessions, with half of the student body attending in the morning and the other half attending in the afternoon. In the fall of 1975 Pine Forest High School opened and some Woodham students were reassigned. The first day of class at Pine Forest High was Monday, November 10, 1975 for the former Woodham students. Another reassignment occurred in 1982 when Booker T. Washington High School was rebuilt in its present location. In the late 1970s, Woodham featured a marching band which wore the same style of uniforms as the University of Southern California Trojan marching band. The band boosters worked for over two years to purchase these uniforms under the direction of Band booster President Ronald Campbell with the assistance and overwhelming support of band families. The marching band, concert band and jazz-rock ensemble (JRE) all posted \\"superior\\" ratings at state contests. The football team won district titles in 1981,1982,1984, and 1985. In 1982 and 1984, the \\"Fighting Titans\\" won the state Class 4A championship and, for a period of time, were ranked number one in the nation by USA Today. The 1982-4 seasons featured a 35 and 1 record, losing only to Choctaw by a score of 9 to 7 during the 1983 regular season. The game-winning field goal by John Laycock was taken off the scoreboard with no time remaining. In 1991 the boys' soccer team won the Class 3A state title. The school's boys' basketball team won the Florida Class 4A state championship in 2003. Woodham's baseball team also won back-to-back District 1 Class 4A championships in 2002 and 2003. In March 2000, Woodham High School's Varsity Cheerleading squad won its first National Championship at the American Open Cheerleading Competition. The team of 15 members won the title in the Small Varsity division. The squad was featured in the August 2000 issue of American Cheerleader Magazine. Hurricane Ivan, which struck the Pensacola area on 16 September 2004, damaged several parts of the school. The cafeteria and media center sustained moderate damage but were repaired within a few weeks. In the fall of 2005, the Escambia County School District and the superintendent, Jim Paul, discussed plans of closing Woodham and converting it into a middle school for Brentwood and Wedgewood Middle schools. The plan, approved by the school board as of December 21, 2006, took effect beginning with the 2007-2008 school year. The Woodham students were re-districted to other area high schools. The textbooks and library books were distributed to other district high schools based on the percentage of Woodham students attending the other high schools. Wendy Zirkin, acting district media coordinator for Escambia County was in charge of the textbook and library inventory and distribution. On May 27, 2007, Woodham held its final classes. Its website now reads: \\"In memory of all Titans, 1965-2007.\\" Woodham was reopened as a middle school later in 2007. Woodham Middle School is now closed.

Battle The German attack had two objectives. One was to seed confusion about the ultimate goals of the overall campaign. There was widespread feeling by almost all observers, especially Soviet high command, that the Germans would reopen their attack on Moscow that summer. By strongly attacking toward Voronezh, near the site of the German's deepest penetration the year before, it would hide the nature of the real action taking place far to the south. Soviet forces sent to the area to shore up the defenses would not be able to move with the same speed as the Germans, who would then turn south and leave them behind. The other purpose was to provide an easily defended front line along the river, providing a strong left flank that could be protected with relatively light forces. KV-1 heavy tank destroyed near Voronezh (1942) The plan involved forces of Army Group South, at this time far north of their ultimate area of responsibility. The attack would be spearheaded by the 4th Panzer Army under the command of General Hermann Hoth. Hoth's highly mobile forces would move rapidly eastward to Voronezh and then turn southeast to follow the Don to Stalingrad. As the 4th moved out of the city, the slower infantry forces of the Second Army following behind them would take up defensive positions along the river. The plan called for the 2nd to arrive just as the 4th had cleared the city, and Hoth was under orders to avoid any street-to-street fighting that might bog down their progress. The city was defended by the troops of the 40th Army as part of the Valuiki-Rossosh Defensive Operation (28 June-24 July 1942) of General of Army Nikolai Fyodorovich Vatutin's Southwestern Front.Vatutin was born in the Voronezh area. Hoth's powerful armored forces moved forward with little delay and the only natural barrier before the city was the Devitsa River, an arm of the Don running through Semiluki, a short distance to the west. For reasons that are unclear, the bridge over the Devitsa was not destroyed, and Hoth's forces were able to sweep aside the defensive forces placed there and reach the outskirts of Voronezh on 7 July. Soviet forces then mounted a successful counterattack that tied up Hoth's forces.Fuller, J.F.C. A Military History of the World: Vol III, p. 522 At this point they should have been relieved by the infantry forces, but they were still far from the city. Intense house-to-house fighting broke out, and Hoth continued to push forward while he waited. At one point the 3rd Motorized Division broke across the Don, but turned back. The Soviet command poured reserves into the city and a situation not unlike what would be seen at Stalingrad a few months later broke out, with the German troops clearing the city street by street with flamethrowers while tanks gave fire support. The 2nd did not arrive for another two days, by which time the 4th was heavily engaged and took some time to remove from the line. The 2nd continued the battle until 24 July, when the final Soviet forces west of the Don were defeated and the fighting ended. Adolf Hitler later came to believe that these two days, when combined with other avoidable delays on the drive south, allowed Marshal Semyon Timoshenko to reinforce the forces in Stalingrad before the 4th Panzer Army could arrive to allow taking of Stalingrad. The Soviet forces recaptured the city in the Battle of Voronezh of 1943.

The Pogo had delta wings and three-bladed contra-rotating propellers powered by a turboprop engine. It was intended to be a high- performance fighter aircraft capable of operating from small warships. Landing the XFY-1 was difficult, as the pilot had to look over his shoulder while carefully working the throttle to land. Design and development After World War II, the Cold War prompted the United States Army and Navy to study VTOL operations. It was envisaged to protect task forces, convoys or any fleet, even without aircraft carriers, by placing VTOLs on any ship. These fighters would be housed within a conical protective housing, saving limited deck space available aboard ships. They would provide first line of airborne defense and reconnaissance capability, before more aircraft could be scrambled to help.Allen 2007, p. 14. In May 1951, Lockheed and Convair were awarded contracts in the attempt to design, construct, and test two experimental VTOL fighters that would be suitable for use by the Armed forces. Although contract stipulations stated that each manufacturer have two fighters, each was only able to construct one, with Lockheed producing the XFV, and Convair producing the XFY, nicknamed the \\"Pogo\\". The first XFY-1 prototype was used for engine testing and the third for static testing, and only the second prototype serial number 138649 was flown.UNited States Navy Centennial Newsletter, Fall 2009, p. 12 The XFY-1 was designed for the Allison YT40-A-14 turboprop expected to deliver 7,100 shp (5,295 kW), the production aircraft were intended to use the even more powerful Allison T54 which was never built.Yenne 2009, p. 103. It had delta wings, swept at 52 degrees, and a fin with a span of 21 ft 8 in (6.5 m). The pilot's seat was mounted on gimbals allowing for movement from 45 degrees in vertical flight to 90 degrees in horizontal flight. The Curtiss- Wright turbo-electric co-axial contra-rotating three-bladed propellers were 16 feet (4.88 m) in diameter.Taylor 1977, p. 63 Operational historyTesting and evaluation= XFY on a launching cart On 19 April 1954, a Convair engineering test pilot and Marine reservist, Lieutenant Colonel James F. \\"Skeets\\" Coleman, made the first tethered flight in the Pogo. The XFY-1 was like no other propeller driven aircraft before it. No previous aircraft with a similar weight, engine power, or size had ever attempted to take off and land vertically. For the safety of both the craft and its pilot, the propeller hub cover was removed and replaced by safety tether lines for the first flight, in case Coleman lost control of the craft and would need to be tethered to prevent the craft falling to the ground. On the other end of the tether was another engineer, Bob McGreary. If Coleman ever lost control, McGreary controlled the winch which could be turned to raise the tethers to prevent the craft from plummeting to the ground. For further safety precautions, four security cables were fastened to each wing in case control was lost in any axis. The tests were conducted inside of a naval airship hangar at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California.Taylor 1977, p. 63. The XFY-1's pilot entering the aircraft via a ladder In flight Throughout the next few weeks, Coleman logged almost 60 hours in test flights in the Pogo, and by August, the test was moved to outdoor conditions. On 1 August 1954, Coleman logged two outdoor test flights, the second flying into the air, and shortly after he flew 70 takeoff‚Äìlanding drills at the Naval Auxiliary Air Station in Brown Field, California.Taylor 1977, p. 63. The first conversion to horizontal flight took place on 5 November 1954.\\"Convair XFY.\\" Flight, 12 November 1954, p. 696. Upon later flights with longer durations, flaws in the design were found. Due to the Pogo's lightweight design, and the lack of spoilers and air brakes, the aircraft lacked the ability to slow down and stop efficiently after moving at high speeds. Landing was also a problem, as the pilot had to look back behind himself during a landing to properly stabilize the craft. It became evident that even if technical problems could be overcome, such VTOL aircraft would be flown only by the most experienced pilots. Thus, it was not feasible to place VTOL fighters‚Äîas previously hoped for‚Äîon every ship. Also, whereas jet-engined fighters had top speeds that approached Mach 2, the turboprop VTOL fighter was at a disadvantage with a top speed below Mach 1. Due to these problems, the XFY Project was put on hiatus.Allen 2007, p. 20. =Later testing= Although a test flight was made on 19 May 1955, it again ended with failure, and on 1 August 1955 the project was formally concluded. The last flight of the XFY-1 Pogo took place in November 1956. Aircraft on display After several years on static display at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia, the Pogo was moved to the National Air and Space Museum in Suitland, Maryland, where it currently resides.Yenne 2009, p. 105.

Released in Japan in December 2009 and worldwide in March 2010, it is the thirteenth title in the mainline Final Fantasy series. The game includes fast-paced combat, a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called \\"Crystarium\\", and a customizable \\"Paradigm\\" system to control which abilities are used by the characters. Final Fantasy XIII includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as summoned monsters, chocobos, and airships. The game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion. Development began in 2004, and the game was first announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2006. Final Fantasy XIII is the flagship title of the Fabula Nova Crystallis collection of Final Fantasy games and is the first game to use Square Enix's Crystal Tools engine. Final Fantasy XIII received mostly positive reviews from video game publications, which praised the game's graphics, presentation, and battle system. The game's story received a mixed response from reviewers, and its linearity compared to previous games in the series was mostly criticized. Selling 1.7 million copies in Japan in 2009, Final Fantasy XIII became the fastest-selling title in the history of the series. As of 2017, the game has sold over 7 million copies worldwide on consoles. (PS3: 5M+, Xbox 360: 2M+) IGN Japan, September 26, 2017 The Microsoft Windows version has sold over 746,000 copies according to SteamSpy. A sequel, titled Final Fantasy XIII-2, was released in December 2011 in Japan and in February 2012 in North America and PAL regions. A second sequel, titled Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, which concludes Lightning's story and the Final Fantasy XIII series, was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and PAL regions. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. On November 13, 2018, it was added to Xbox One Backward Compatibility along with its sequels making it playable on the console. It is also Xbox One X Enhanced allowing it to run at a higher resolution. Gameplay The player directly controls the on-screen character through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360¬∞ view of the surroundings. The world of Final Fantasy XIII is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier Final Fantasy games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the world by foot or by chocobo. Players may save their game to a hard disk drive using save stations, where the player can also purchase items from retail networks or upgrade their weapons. An in-game datalog provides a bestiary and incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XIII. The Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International version of the game, released in Japan, also contains an \\"Easy\\" mode option. =Battle system= health and roles displayed. The enemy's name and damage percentage are shown in the upper right corner. As in Final Fantasy XII, enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous Final Fantasy titles; the character's health is fully restored after each battle. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). During battle, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which refills in real time to a set maximum number; this total size gradually increases throughout the game from two to six. The player is not limited to sets of attacks; they may perform actions immediately, provided the ATB slots are available. The player may also select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. The Paradigm system allows the player to program \\"Paradigms\\" in which the active party members have a specific role in combat, roughly akin to the job system of previous games. The player can only choose from a limited stock of paradigms set up outside of battle, limiting the possible combinations of roles available; this is the only way of directing AI- controlled party members. The roles consist of Commando, dealing physical damage; Ravager, using elemental magic; Medic, a role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities and may take on enemy focus. Each of the characters can initially take on three given roles, though later in the game, each character's remaining three roles are accessible in limited capacity. In addition to a health bar, each enemy has a stagger bar (or \\"chain bonus\\"), indicating with a percentage starting at 100 the strength of attacks dealt by the player. When the chain bonus reaches an amount specific to the kind of enemy, they are staggered. Stagger increases damage massively by providing an instant boost to the chain bonus, and may launch the enemy into the air. Stagger is increased by a large amount by magic-based attacks, but will fall unless sustained by physical attacks. Each leader or controlled character can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, in which the Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them. =Crystarium= The Crystarium is a leveling system consisting of six crystals and resembles the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X. Each crystal in the Crystarium represents one of the six roles, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies. The full Crystarium is not available to the player at the beginning of the game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels. SynopsisSetting= Final Fantasy XIII is set on the world of Gran Pulse (often simply called Pulse). Central to the story is Cocoon, a massive artificial sphere that floats above Pulse's surface and is ruled by the Sanctum, a theocratic government. The two worlds are controlled by fal'Cie , mechanical beings with godlike power. The Cocoon fal'Cie are responsible for keeping Cocoon floating, as well as providing light and water to the people that live inside. Each fal'Cie handles a specific task. The fal'Cie have the capability of marking the humans that live in Pulse and Cocoon as their servants. These servants, called l'Cie , are branded with a symbol representing either Pulse or Cocoon and are given a \\"Focus\\"‚Äîa task to complete. If the l'Cie complete their task in time, they are transformed to crystal and according to legend gain eternal life; otherwise they become mindless monsters called Cie'th . The l'Cie are not explicitly told their Focus, but are instead given visions that they must interpret. Several hundred years before the events of the game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse attacked and ripped a large hole in Cocoon. Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power. The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse. The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of Manadrives. =Characters= The six main playable characters of Final Fantasy XIII are Lightning, the main protagonist of the game, a former soldier and older sister to Serah; Snow Villiers, Serah's fianc√© and leader of NORA, a paramilitary group; Oerba Dia Vanille, the game's narrator and an exile who is later revealed to be a l'Cie from Pulse; Sazh Katzroy, a civilian pilot and father to a young boy, Dajh; Hope Estheim, a young boy who is struggling within the relationships he shares with his parents; and Oerba Yun Fang, a l'Cie from Pulse who is working with the Sanctum's Cavalry branch. Other characters include Galenth Dysley, the ruler of the Sanctum and main antagonist; Cid Raines, a Sanctum Brigadier General in the Cavalry who does not trust the government; and Serah Farron, Lightning's younger sister and Snow's fianc√©e. =Plot= The playable cast of Final Fantasy XIII. From left to right: Sazh Katzroy, Snow Villiers, Hope Estheim, Lightning, Oerba Yun Fang, and Oerba Dia Vanille In Cocoon, the citizens of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, after coming in contact with something from Pulse. Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous thirteen days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah. As Snow leads his resistance group NORA to rescue the Purge exiles, several of them are killed. Heading to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, Snow is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two parties meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as she turns to crystal. Anima then brands them as l'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon. During this transformation, the newly crested l'Cie all have the same vision: a monster called Ragnarok. Arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus, the party finds Serah in her crystallized form; Snow remains with her as the others leave. Snow meets Cid and Fang, two members of the Cavalry, after he is captured and detained aboard the airship Lindblum. Meanwhile, the others flee from PSICOM before getting separated by an airstrike; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum, while Sazh and Vanille travel to Nautilus. In Lightning's scenario, she unintentionally supports Hope's goal of killing Snow to avenge his mother's death. In Vanille's scenario, Sazh discusses how his son Dajh was turned into a l'Cie by a Cocoon fal'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to discover his Focus. In Palumpolum, Lightning attempts to dissuade Hope from going through with his revenge and meets Snow and Fang. Fang reveals that she and Vanille were l'Cie from Pulse who were turned into crystals; they were turned back into humans 13 days earlier, sparking the Purge. Hope attempts to murder Snow, but after being rescued during an airstrike, he decides not to go through with it. The four then flee the city with Cid's aid. In Nautilus, Vanille reveals herself to Sazh as a l'Cie from Pulse, and indirectly the reason that Dajh was turned into a l'Cie. Sazh and Vanille are then captured and detained on board the airship Palamecia. On the Palamecia, the other members of the party reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in disguise. Barthandelus tells the party that their Focus is to transform into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party flees and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves. Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries earlier, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan. The party flies away to Pulse and journeys to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. The town is deserted, and they find no living people on the surface. The party is unsuccessful in removing their marks, and Barthandelus confronts them again. The party learns that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a coup d'√©tat. The party infiltrates Cocoon and heads towards Orphan but soon discover that the Cavalry have been turned into Cie'th. The party defeats Barthandelus, but Orphan awakens and merges with Barthandelus, then compels Fang to finish her Focus as Ragnarok while the others are seemingly transformed into Cie'th. The party reappears in human form, preventing Fang from transforming. The party defeats Orphan and escapes Cocoon, which is now falling towards Pulse. As the rest of the party turns to crystal for completing their Focus, Vanille and Fang remain on Cocoon and transform into Ragnarok together to prevent a collision between Cocoon and Pulse. The rest of the party awaken from their crystallization on Pulse and find their l'Cie brands gone; Lightning, Hope, Snow and Sazh reunite with Serah and Dajh. Development Director and scenario designer Motomu Toriyama at the 2010 Game Developers Conference Development of Final Fantasy XIII began in February 2004, shortly after the release of Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission in Japan. At the time, the project was internally referred to by the codename \\"Colors World\\". Over the first year, director Motomu Toriyama and scenario conceptor Kazushige Nojima conceived ideas for the plot. Nojima thought up the crystal mythology that became the basis for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series, including concepts such as the fal'Cie and l'Cie. Toriyama then created a story premised on this mythology. He wanted to portray \\"characters at the mercy of a predetermined, unjust fate\\" who \\"belong together but collide heavily\\". In order to achieve this, each of the story's thirteen chapters was made to focus on different protagonists. Chapters seven and eight were to mark a turning point in the interpersonal relationships of the party. In March 2006, when the structural part of the narrative started to come together, lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team. Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes that needed to be kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected. For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say \\"Snow and Hope reconcile\\". Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize what the story tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a \\"reliable and calm leader type\\" at the beginning of the story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was \\"almost a little too dark\\", he wanted to include something like it in the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance. At the beginning of the development, the game was intended to be released on the PlayStation 2. In May 2005, however, after the positive reception of the tech demo of Final Fantasy VII, the team decided to move the game to the PlayStation 3 and developed it with the new Crystal Tools engine, a seventh generation multiplatform game engine created by Square Enix for its next generation games. Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to XIII. Another factor in the platform move was the delayed release of Final Fantasy XII, which came out a very short time before the release of the PlayStation 3. A PC port was considered during development, but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform, such as security issues. Final Fantasy XIII was first shown at the 2006 E3 convention. The trailer shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game. Announced alongside the game was Final Fantasy Versus XIII, later retitled as Final Fantasy XV, and the PlayStation Portable game Final Fantasy Type-0, originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, the three of which form the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy series. Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story. The developers for Final Fantasy XIII were divided into multiple areas, with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in-game area or modeling characters. Each physical area of the game was developed separately; after an initial design was approved, teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas. Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series. Director Motomu Toriyama had worked on Final Fantasy X and X-2; producer Yoshinori Kitase had worked on V through VIII and as the producer for X and X-2; main-character designer Tetsuya Nomura had performed the same role for VII, VIII, X, and X-2, and battle-system director Toshiro Tsuchida reprised that role from Final Fantasy X. As XIII was the first Final Fantasy game for the PlayStation 3, the development team's internal goal was for the game to have the same \\"gameplay and craftmanship\\" impact that Final Fantasy VII and X had as the first games of the series on their respective consoles. They aimed to sell five million copies of the game. Toriyama wanted the game to be \\"the ultimate single player RPG\\". Tsuchida's concept for the battle system was to maintain the strategic nature of command- based battles. The system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in the film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Magic points (MP), which had been a part of the battle system in previous Final Fantasy titles, were removed in the game's battle system as Tsuchida and the other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to the MP cost, in turn making battles less interesting. The Paradigm system was designed early in the battle system's development, with the intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast-moving. Originally there were only five roles, but the Saboteur was later added as the designers felt that its abilities were missing from the game and did not fit with the other roles. Together with the maximum of three characters in a combat situation, the groupings of enemies were designed to force the player to switch Paradigms to keep them engaged in the battles. Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a new type of female character with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series. His guideline to Nomura was to make her \\"strong and beautiful\\", and she was intended to be reminiscent of Final Fantasy VIIs Cloud Strife. Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development. The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role in the creation of the non-playable characters. Unlike previous games in the series which were more inspired by Asian locations and culture, Final Fantasy XIII was intended by the art team to be reminiscent of the United States. Pulse was based on landscape photographs the team took from across the country, and Cocoon was intended to be a \\"melting pot\\" of different ethnicities. The setting was also given a science fiction aesthetic to make it stand out more in comparison with other entries in the series. Art director Isamu Kamikokuryo revealed that many additional scenarios such as Lightning's home, which were functioning in an unreleased build during development, were left out of the final version due to concerns about the game's length and volume. Kamikokuryo said the content they cut was, in itself, enough to make another game. According to Toriyama, the cuts were made in \\"various stages of [the game's] development\\", and that some of the content was removed just before the game's completion. The game, unlike previous titles in the series, includes no explorable town areas; Toriyama said in an interview that the team was unable to make them as graphically appealing as the rest of the game and chose to eliminate them. Toriyama intended to have a piece of downloadable content available for the game that would include a new area, weapons and quests, but was forced to cut it as well due to quality concerns so late in the project and difficulties with the different systems for extra content on the two gaming consoles. A playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII was included in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete, released on April 16, 2009. Toriyama stated that the release of the demo, which was not in the original development schedule, helped the team recognize a shared vision for what the game should look and feel like, a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then. It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done, which increased the development speed for the remainder of the project. The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used. The English localization began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases. The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3, but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game's development cycle. The Xbox version, due to technical limitations, runs at a lower resolution (720p maximum) than the PlayStation version and is spread across 3 discs. =Music= Masashi Hamauzu composed the game's soundtrack; his previous work on the series was as a co- composer for Final Fantasy X and as the main composer for Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII. The game was the first main-series Final Fantasy game to not include any compositions by original series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Although Uematsu was originally announced to compose the main theme of the game, this role was taken over by Hamauzu after Uematsu signed on to compose the soundtrack to Final Fantasy XIV. The score features some pieces orchestrated by Yoshihisa Hirano, Toshiyuki Oomori, and Kunihito Shiina, with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. The song \\"My Hands\\", from British singer Leona Lewis' second album Echo, was chosen to replace Final Fantasy XIII's original theme song, \\"Kimi ga Iru Kara\\" by Sayuri Sugawara, for the game's international release. Square Enix president Yoichi Wada later said that it would have been better if the American branch of the company had produced a theme song from scratch, but a lack of staff led to the decision of licensing an existing song. Music from the game has been released in several albums. Square Enix released the main soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack, on four Compact Discs in 2010. The album sold 16,000 copies the day of its release. Square Enix released selections from the soundtrack on two gramophone record albums in 2010: W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII and W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII Gentle Reveries. An album of arranged pieces from the soundtrack, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack -PLUS-, was also released by Square Enix in 2010, as was an album of piano arrangements. For Life Music published a single of the theme song for the Japanese version of the game, \\"Kimi ga Iru Kara\\" (Âêõ„Åå„ÅÑ„Çã„Åã„Çâ, \\"Because You're Here\\"), in 2009. Versions and merchandise Art director Isamu Kamikokuryo (left) and producer Yoshinori Kitase (right) at the Final Fantasy XIII London Launch Event at HMV in March 2010, which was hosted by Alex Zane (holding microphone). The game was released in Japan on December 17, 2009, and in North America, Europe and Australia on March 9, 2010. Alongside the release of the game in Japan, Japanese alcoholic beverage distributor Suntory released the \\"Final Fantasy XIII Elixir\\" to promote the game. On the same day, a Final Fantasy XIII PlayStation Home personal space was made available for free in Japan until January 13, 2010, along with a costume and personal space furnishings; they were released to the Asian, European, and North American versions of PlayStation Home on March 11, 2010. On December 18, 2012, the game was re-released as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box Japanese package. It was re-released again on November 21, 2013, as part of the Lightning Ultimate box, a Japan exclusive edition which includes Final Fantasy XIII and its two sequels. The game was released bundled with consoles in different regions. The game was bundled in Japan with a limited-edition white PlayStation 3 with a pink color print of Lightning on the surface of the console, and with an Xbox 360 with the silver strip on the hard drive emblazoned with the Final Fantasy XIII logo in the western release. A limited quantity of themed Xbox faceplates created by Nomura were made available through a select few retailers in Europe, North America, and Australia. PAL territories received a limited collector's edition of the game for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with the Final Fantasy XIII Original Sound Selection \\"best of\\" soundtrack CD, three Eidolon art prints, a Brand of the l'Cie decal and The World of Final Fantasy XIII, a hardback book featuring character artwork, CG-rendered artwork, and environments from across the game production. Square Enix published three Ultimania books: the Final Fantasy XIII Scenario Ultimania and the Final Fantasy XIII Battle Ultimania on January 28, 2010, and the Final Fantasy XIII Ultimania Œ© on September 30, 2010. The Battle Ultimania provides a description and analysis of the new battle system and its components, and developer interviews. The Scenario Ultimania describes the main scenarios in the game, profiles on the characters and areas in Cocoon and Gran Pulse, developer interviews, and details on each location. The last guide, the Ultimania Œ©, includes voice actor and additional staff interviews, the complete story of Final Fantasy XIII including additional character profiles, a collection of artworks and illustrations, and additional dissections of the story and background. While the game was released on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in western regions, the game was a PlayStation 3 exclusive in Asian territories. This was changed in late 2010 when Square Enix announced that the Xbox 360 version would in fact release in Japan, despite many statements to the opposite. It was later released for Microsoft Windows via Steam, along with its two sequels. Final Fantasy XIII was the first game in the series to receive an official release in Chinese and Korean. This was the first edition of a Final Fantasy game in which Japanese voice-overs could be enabled. An international version of the game for the Xbox 360 called Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International was released in Asia on December 16, 2010. The game includes an \\"Easy\\" mode option, and features the English voices. It comes with a bonus booklet titled Final Fantasy XIII Corridor of Memory that contains content that was previously left out of the original version of the game and a short story epilogue titled Final Fantasy XIII Episode I. Final Fantasy XIII was released for iOS and Android devices via cloud streaming in Japan on April 10, 2015. On November 13, 2018 it was added to Xbox One Backward Compatibility along with its sequels making it playable on the console. It is also Xbox One X Enhanced allowing it to run at a higher resolution. Reception Final Fantasy XIII sold over one million units on its first day of sale in Japan, and had sold 1.7 million copies for the PlayStation 3 in Japan by the end of 2009, and 1.9 million by the end of 2010. Square Enix had anticipated high initial sales for the game and shipped close to two million units for its launch. The game sold more than one million copies in North America in its release month. In March 2010, Square Enix stated that Final Fantasy XIII was the fastest-selling title in the franchise's history. By April of the same year, American game sales for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 reached an estimated 800,000 and 500,000 units respectively. According to Media Create, female gamers accounted for nearly a third of the game's Japanese fanbase. As of July 2012, a combined total of 9.7 million units has been sold on consoles for both Final Fantasy XIII and its sequel Final Fantasy XIII-2. As of January 2013, the game had sold 6.6 million copies worldwide. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. In November 2018, the series was added to Xbox One backwards compatibility. As of 2017, the game has sold over 7 million copies worldwide on consoles. By April 2018, the Windows version has sold over 746,000 copies according to SteamSpy. Final Fantasy XIII received generally positive reviews. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 83/100 based on 83 reviews, the Xbox 360 version 82/100 based on 54 reviews, and the Microsoft Windows version 65/100 based on 6 reviews. It was rated 39 out of 40 by the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu. Dengeki praised the game for the battle system, stating that the battles are by far the most exciting in the series, and concluded Final Fantasy XIII deserved a score of 120, as 100 would not be enough. The game was voted as the second best game of 2009 in Dengeki Online's reader poll, and in January 2010, it was voted the best game ever in Famitsu reader poll. The game received a Best RPG of the year award nomination at the Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to Mass Effect 2. It won the \\"Future Division\\" award at the Japan Game Awards 2009 and later won a Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards 2010. Universal praise was given to the technical milestones achieved by the game's graphics and presentation. Edge felt that Cocoon in particular was an \\"inspired setting [...] blessed with a vibrancy and vivid colour that often leaves you open-mouthed\\". GameSpot called the art design \\"magnificent\\". Further praise was given to the pre-rendered animation sequences and the almost seamless transition of visual quality between these and the realtime gameplay. Many also appreciated the game's soundtrack, with Masashi Hamauzu providing \\"a score with catchy hooks and blood-pumping battle melodies\\", according to Wired. The battle system of Final Fantasy XIII received widespread praise. The increased pace of battles was appreciated, with several reviews describing it as \\"thrilling\\"; Edges description of the battle system summarized it as \\"among the genre's finest\\". 1UP.com said that \\"Despite the fact that two-thirds of your party is AI- controlled, FFXIII's battles may be the most involving the series has ever seen.\\" The story got a mixed reception, with Wired remarking that the plot was \\"a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games\\". 1UP.com felt that the story was \\"hardly world-class writing\\", but that the writers clearly knew the medium well and had attempted to avoid clich√©s. Reviewers felt that the characters worked well together, and that the interactions among them as the game progressed made up for shortcomings in the story. =Linearity= While critics generally praised Square Enix's attempt to revitalize the Final Fantasy series formula, many reacted negatively to the linear nature of the game, especially in the first ten chapters on Cocoon, an issue which many felt was compounded by the large reduction of towns, free-roaming capabilities, and interaction with non-player characters. GamePro described the gameplay as \\"a long hallway toward an orange target symbol on your mini-map that triggers a cutscene, a boss fight, or both,\\" and 1UP.com criticized the linear aspect as the game's \\"biggest shortcoming\\", and felt the first section was \\"superficial.\\" Edge and others awarded the game especially lower scores as a result of these aspects, with Edge in particular lowering the score they awarded the game to a five out of ten primarily due to the game's linear nature. In contrast, reviewers from GamesRadar and Computer and Video Games appreciated the linear nature; the former stated that \\"the streamlined, focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down\\", while the latter felt it was \\"a clever move\\", and kept the player from being \\"[bogged] down with mundane number crunching, [and] finicky and repetitive leveling-up.\\" Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player's abilities over this first part of the game, from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader. Combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as \\"boring\\" until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed. Edge noted that while it did not do enough to make up for the opening chapters, at Gran Pulse the game \\"hits a sweet spot\\" as the narrative offers \\"hunting side-quests and the simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is around the next corner.\\" =Response to criticism= After release, director Motomu Toriyama felt that the lower-than-expected review scores for a main Final Fantasy series game came from reviewers who approached the game from a Western point of view. These reviewers were used to games in which the player was given an open world to explore, he said, noting that this expectation contrasted with the vision the team set out to create. He noted that it \\"becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when you're given that much freedom\\". Yoshinori Kitase stated that they \\"didn't really intend to work within the RPG template,\\" but \\"wanted to create a new game, even a new genre.\\" He stated that \\"in a lot of senses FFXIII is more like an FPS than an RPG.\\" Toriyama and Kitase later said, in July 2011, that the biggest complaints about the game were that it was too linear and that there was not enough interaction between the player and the world, which they described as a lack of towns and minigames compared to the previous Final Fantasy games. They also named the amount of time it took to access all of the gameplay elements as a common criticism, saying that people interpreted it as a \\"lengthy tutorial\\". Yoichi Wada, then-president of Square Enix, made his thoughts about the reception of the game known to Gamasutra. He said \\"some value it highly and some are not very happy with it\\". He added, \\"Should Final Fantasy become a new type of game or should Final Fantasy not become a new type of game? The customers have different opinions. It's very difficult to determine which way it should go.\\" =Windows port= Square Enix released a Microsoft Windows port of the game in October 2014, where it was met with a more critical reception than the original versions. PC Gamers Samuel Roberts, when reviewing the port, criticized not only the original gameplay, but heavily criticized the quality of the port itself, decrying the low resolution, limited graphical options and low framerate. He was especially critical of the time taken for the port given that an unofficial patch was produced by modder Peter Thoman within a day of release that fixed many of the issues. Michael McWhertor of Polygon also noted a similar critical response by consumers. A patch was released by Square Enix in December 2014, which was noted by Thoman as adding only the graphical features that his external patch had, with no other additions or performance improvements. Sequels At the Square Enix First Production Department Conference held on January 18, 2011, Square Enix announced that they were developing a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XIII, entitled Final Fantasy XIII-2, which they intended to build on the game's story and characters while taking on board the criticism and other feedback about the original. It was released on December 15, 2011, in Japan, January 31, 2012, in North America and February 3, 2012, in Europe, for both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. Motomu Toriyama and Yoshinori Kitase returned to their respective roles as director and producer. The game begins three years after the events of Final Fantasy XIII, and features Serah and newcomer Noel as the main protagonists. XIII-2 is the fifth sequel game in the Final Fantasy series, after Final Fantasy X-2, Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings, and Final Fantasy IV: The After Years. Most of the team returned again to create a second sequel entitled Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, meant to wrap up the story of Lightning and the Final Fantasy XIII universe. The game was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and Europe. Toriyama stated in the Ultimania Omega companion book prior to XIII-2s announcement that he hoped to write a story \\"where Lightning ends up happy\\", though at the time Square Enix had no plans to make a sequel.

Their views are grouped under the names realist (also realistic) phenomenology or phenomenology of essences. Munich phenomenology represents one branch of what is referred to as the early phenomenology. History In 1895, a number of students working with the psychologist Theodor Lipps at the University of Munich founded the Psychologische Verein (\\"Psychological Association\\"). A number of the participants in this student association, notably , Moritz Geiger, Alexander Pf√§nder, and Adolf Reinach, were inspired by Edmund Husserl's Logical Investigations (1900/01). The book was critical of the psychologism of their teacher (Lipps), and presented a new way of doing philosophy, known as \\"phenomenology.\\" Choosing to align themselves with Husserl, they became the Munich Circle of phenomenologists. Around 1905, many of Lipps' students (following the lead of Daubert) temporarily abandoned Munich and headed to the University of G√∂ttingen to study with Husserl directly. This is referred to as the \\"Munich invasion of G√∂ttingen,\\" and is generally considered to be the starting point of the phenomenological movement proper. The arrival of students from Munich eventually led to the establishment of a similar student group in G√∂ttingen circa 1910, known as the \\"G√∂ttingen Circle.\\" In 1912 the Jahrbuch f√ºr Philosophie und ph√§nomenologische Forschung was founded with Husserl, Geiger, Reinach, Pf√§nder, and Max Scheler as its editors. After Husserl's publication of the Ideen zu einer reinen Ph√§nomenologie und ph√§nomenologischen Philosophie. Erstes Buch (Ideas I) in the first edition of the Jahrbuch, a number of his followers took a critical stance towards Husserl's new vision of phenomenology. Many members of the Munich group distanced themselves from Husserl's idealism and his transcendental phenomenology, preferring the earlier realist phenomenology of the first edition of the Logical Investigations.

Jackson wrote A Century of Dishonor in an attempt to change government ideas/policy toward Native Americans at a time when effects of the 1871 Indian Appropriations Act (making the entire Native American population wards of the nation) had begun to draw the attention of the public. Jackson attended a meeting in Boston in 1879 at which Standing Bear, a Ponca, told how the federal government forcibly removed his tribe from its ancestral homeland in the wake of the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation. After meeting Standing Bear, she conducted research at the Astor Library in New York and was shocked by the story of government mistreatment that she found. She wrote in a letter, \\"I shall be found with 'Indians' engraved on my brain when I am dead.‚ÄîA fire has been kindled within me which will never go out.\\" Jackson sent a copy of her book to every member of Congress, at her own expense. She hoped to awaken the conscience of the American people, and their representatives, to the flagrant wrongs that had been done to the American Indians, and persuade them \\"to redeem the name of the United States from the stain of a century of dishonor\\".Prucha, Francis Paul (1986). The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians, p. 208. University of Nebraska Press. . The book consists primarily of the tribal histories of seven different tribes. Among the incidents it depicts is the eradication of Praying Town Indians in the colonial period, despite their recent conversion to Christianity, because it was assumed that all Indians were the same. Her book brought to light the injustices enacted upon the Native Americans as it chronicled the ruthlessness of white settlers in their greed for land, wealth, and power. Upon its publication, A Century of Dishonor received some adverse criticism and was dismissed as \\"sentimental\\". But it had some effect in shaking the moral senses of America, and in 1881 Congress acted to remedy, in part, the situation of the Ponca people. However, it did not have quite the impact that Jackson wanted, which spurred her to write an emotional appeal to action in Ramona. Long out of print, A Century of Dishonor was first reprinted in 1964 by Ross & Haines of Minneapolis, Minnesota via a limited printing of 2,000 copies, and has been reprinted numerous times since then.  Synopsis  Originally published in 1881, Helen Hunt Jackson chronicles the treatment of American Indians by the United States beginning in colonial times through to her present. The book can be broken down into four major themes: * the mistreatment of seven major Native American tribes * promises and treaties issued and broken by the United States government to these tribes * forced removal of these (and other) tribes to reservations located on land that was unsuitable for farming or sustaining the Native American way of life * massacres of the Native American people by white Americans. Jackson begins by providing in her \\"Introductory\\" a summary of the policies and positions of the United States relative to the Native American population; however, because of the time in which she was writing, she refers to them as Indians. Jackson calls attention to the changes that occurred when the United States took territory from the colonial powers. Most prominently, the United States did not acknowledge or respect Native claims to the land, as recognized by treaties, to the same degree that Spain, Britain, and France had. This was in part, she explains, because the treaties written in English purposefully had different expectations than those written for and signed by the Native populations. She contextualizes her distress by examining the attitudes of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary from the end of the 18th century through much of the 19th century. She concludes by stating that through their unjust treatment of Native Americans, the United States violated international law and made itself susceptible to a reputation for cruelty. = The Peoples = The seven chapters that follow the introduction each describe the general history of the Delaware, the Cheyenne, the Nez Perc√©, the Sioux, the Ponca, the Winnebagoes, and the Cherokee, as well as the way their cultures shaped the way the United States took advantage of them. Jackson uses evidence from Official Reports of the War Department or the Department of Interior to show that the United States did not hide the atrocities they committed, nor did they see them as such. In addition to using evidence that the United States provided of their mistreatment of Native Americans, Jackson also took great care to ensure that she included information on how each of the people viewed themselves and how they felt about the way they were treated. For example, at the beginning of her chapter on the Sioux, she provides a history of their name (it comes from the old French word Nadouessioux meaning enemies) but also includes that they refer to themselves as \\"Dakota.\\" = Massacres = Having shared the legal and cultural trouble that the aforementioned tribes experienced at the hands of the United States, Jackson goes on to provide detailed descriptions of three massacres: The Conestoga Massacre, the Gnadenh√ºtten Massacre, and the Massacres of Apaches, as a demonstration of the violence committed against Native Americans. In addition to explaining the atrocities and violence, Jackson also provides a history of the interactions between the Native Americans and the white population prior to the massacres. = Conclusion = Jackson concludes that \\"[i]t makes little difference, however, where one opens the record of the history of the Indians; every page and every year has its dark stain.\\" She calls on all branches of government, no matter how difficult the process or how long over due, to right their wrongs. Jackson outlines four changes, the cessation of cheating, robbing, and breaking promises, along with the end of refusing to protect Native American property rights under American law, that she believes are at least a good start to make up for all of the harm that the United States government caused.  Background  Jackson wrote A Century of Dishonor in an attempt to change government ideas/policy toward Native Americans at a time when effects of the 1871 Indian Appropriations Act (making the entire Native American population wards of the nation) had begun to draw the attention of the public. Jackson attended a meeting in Boston in 1879 at which Standing Bear, a Ponca, told how the federal government forcibly removed his tribe from its ancestral homeland in the wake of the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation. After meeting Standing Bear, she conducted research at the Astor Library in New York and was shocked by the story of government mistreatment that she found. She wrote in a letter, \\"I shall be found with 'Indians' engraved on my brain when I am dead.‚ÄîA fire has been kindled within me which will never go out.\\" She collected information from a number of sources that shaped her well-rounded approach to understanding the experience of Native Americans and their relationship with the United States. At the start of the book, she provides an appendix of the reports and accounts that she relied on including records of prices that white men paid for scalps (of Native Americans) and personal testimonials of grievances that Sioux had experienced.  Distribution  The book was originally published in 1881 and personally sent a copy of her book to every member of Congress, at her own expense. She hoped to awaken the conscience of the American people, and their representatives, to the flagrant wrongs that had been done to the American Indians, and persuade them \\"to redeem the name of the United States from the stain of a century of dishonor\\". After a long hiatus, the book was first reprinted in 1964 by Ross & Haines of Minneapolis, Minnesota via a limited printing of 2,000 copies. However, this was soon followed by a larger printing from Harper & Row in their Torchbook series in 1965, with an introductory essay by Andrew F. Rolle but without the fifteen documents that served as an appendix of supporting evidence in the original work and its first reprinting. Inspired by the women‚Äôs movement of the 1970s, it was not until the 1980s that more extensive attention to Jackson and others like her began to appear in academic journals.  Reception  Critical Response = Initially, some critics, including President Theodore Roosevelt, dismissed her as being a \\"sentimental historian,\\" which he did in the first appendix to The Winning of the West. However, more than a century later, historian John Milton Cooper countered Roosevelt's dismissal of Jackson's argument by stating that Roosevelt's view of Native American history was, \\"Eurocentric, racist, male dominated, and environmentally obtuse from a late twentieth century point of view.\\" Over time, her work has been recognized for its important impact on the nation's understanding of the mistreatment of Native Americans by the United States and prompted discussion on the role of women's voices in history both publicly and academically. However, critics continue to reference the text as a predecessor to Ramona rather than as a text that stands alone. = Public Response = Although there was a good deal of adverse criticism even at the time of its publication, A Century of Dishonor, along with Jackson‚Äôs many magazine articles, letters to editors, and personal contacts, had an effect, and in March 1887 Congress passed a bill partially rectifying the particular situation of the Ponca people whose cause had first attracted her attention. The Dawes Act was born out of Jackson's efforts and called for the return of Native lands to Native Americans in an act of humanitarian reform. Though it did not come close to fully or successfully addressing all of the grievances that Jackson had expressed. The New York Evangelist, a periodical that existed for most of the 19th century, wrote a review just after the book was published in which they reiterated Jackson's purpose for writing: to draw attention to the disregard of the right of Native Americans by the United States government and called on the country to adopt a Christian policy toward Native Americans that was both 'just and humane.' In addition, for decades after it was published, the reporting that Jackson did in A Century of Dishonor was used to justify arguments against government treatment of Native Americans, especially by the Indian Bureau.  Connections to Ramona  Many of the articles that mention A Century of Dishonor from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are reviews of Ramona in which A Century of Dishonor is mentioned as its predecessor and that Jackson's journey to write A Century of Dishonor led her from the east coast to California where she found inspiration for the novel. Christine Holbo argues that, 'The divide separating A Century of Dishonor‚Äôs legalistic human rights activism from the kaleidoscopic and even campy aesthetics of Ramona deserves more attention. Undoubtedly, the two projects shared a common concern for the plight of Native Americans in post- Reconstruction America. But their differences suggest, at the very least, a disconnect between means and ends. To the degree to which Ramona can be read as an appeal on behalf of Native American rights, a continuation of the project laid out in A Century of Dishonor, the novel must be read against its romantic interpretation of mission- and Mexican-era California.' Valerie Sherer Mathes, in her book Helen Hunt Jackson and Her Indian Reform Legacy, devotes a single chapter to A Century of Dishonor in which she suggests that while the initial response was lacking in enthusiasm, Jackson‚Äôs ‚Äòwork had definitely acquainted the public with the deplorable condition of the American Indian,‚Äô but that its greater importance was laying ‚Äòthe groundwork for Jackson‚Äôs next Indian crusade,‚Äô Ramona.

It comprises the City of Joliet in Illinois and its surrounding counties: DuPage, Ford, Grundy, Iroquois, Kankakee, Kendall and Will. It is governed by a bishop, who is a suffragan of the Archbishop of Chicago. The mother church is the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus. On May 17, 2011, the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, announced that Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop R. Daniel Conlon, 62, until then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Steubenville in Steubenville, Ohio (part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Cincinnati, Ohio), as Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Joliet (part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Chicago, Illinois), succeeding Archbishop James Peter Sartain, who became archbishop of Seattle, Washington in September 2010. History In 1808, the area that is now known as Joliet was governed by the Diocese of Bardstown, present-day Archdiocese of Louisville in Kentucky. In 1824, administration of the area was transferred to the Archdiocese of Saint Louis in Missouri. Another period of reorganization for the expanding American Catholic community led to the transfer of administration over Joliet to the now-defunct Diocese of Vincennes, present- day Archdiocese of Indianapolis. In 1836, with the construction of the I&M; canal, Irish immigrants swarmed into the area. Fr. John Plunkett was assigned to provide to the spiritual needs of the workers. He established St. Patrick Church, which is still operating, as the first church in the Joliet area. With the industrialization of Illinois and the emergence of Chicago as an important center of commerce for the nation, the new churches and missions in the Joliet area flourished. Its congregants were mostly newly arrived immigrant laborers from Europe and several generations of local farmers. In 1948, Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of Joliet to meet the demands of the exponential growth of Catholicism in the region, resulting from local post-World War II housing developments and commercial modernization, and named Reverend Martin McNamara as the first bishop. Bishop McNamara selected St. Raymond's church as the cathedral, however by 1950, the 540-seat church proved inadequate and he began planning a new facility. The Bishop consecrated the new Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus on May 26, 1955. =Reports of sex abuse= In April 2015, the Diocese of Joliet agreed to pay $4,137,500 to resolve the claims of 14 males who were the victims of abuse by priests of the diocese from the 1960s through the 1980s.https://illinoissexabuseattorney.com/roman-catholic-diocese- joliet-settles-claims-14-individuals-abused-priests/ A list released by the Diocese of Joliet in August 2018 revealed the names of 35 clergy who served in the diocese during a 70-year period and were \\"credibly accused\\" of sex abuse.https://patch.com/illinois/joliet/35-joliet-priests-had-credible-child- sex-abuse-allegations On August 31, 2018, it was announced that the diocese had agreed to pay $1.3 million to three males who claimed they had been sexually abused in the diocese during the early 1980s.http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-met-joliet-priest-sex-abuse- settlement-20180830-story.html BishopsBishops of Joliet in Illinois= * Martin Dewey McNamara (1948‚Äì1966) * Romeo Roy Blanchette (1966‚Äì1979) * Joseph Leopold Imesch (1979‚Äì2006) * J.

Opened in 1970, it is named after Increase Mather, a Puritan in the Massachusetts Bay Colony who served as President of Harvard University from 1685 to 1692. Mather's Faculty Deans are Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan and Amala Mahadevan. Mather is known for its nineteen-story concrete tower built in a Brutalist style. Mather's blocky concrete architecture reflects the anti- uprising style of the day of its construction. Mather residents are guaranteed single bedrooms for all three years of their residency. Mather's second building, a low-rise surrounding a courtyard, has suites with large common rooms and small bedrooms, whereas suites in the high-rise have large bedrooms and no common rooms. Other than houses in the Radcliffe Quadrangle, Mather is the house farthest from Harvard Yard, but the school provides regular shuttle service between the Yard and Mather's courtyard. Mather House was a favorite choice for hard-partying varsity athletes before housing assignments were randomized by the school. The house is known among students for its social life and a spacious, newly remodeled dining hall with a view of the Charles River. Mather's sister college is Morse College at Yale University. History Portrait of Increase Mather, namesake of Mather House, by Joan van der Spriet. Opened in 1970, Mather House is the most recently constructed of Harvard's houses. It takes its name from Increase Mather, a Harvard alumnus and prominent Puritan minister in the Massachusetts Bay Colony who served as the University's president from 1685 to 1692. The architectural firm that designed Mather House, Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbott, is also responsible for the Art Institute of Chicago, the original campus of Stanford University (along with Frederick Law Olmsted), the Ames Building, and the completion of Boston's Trinity Church. Social life and the Lather Mather Tower The open architecture of Mather's common spaces makes it easy to host social events. Mather's Housing Committee hosts happy hours every two weeks. In addition, the House hosts formal dances twice a year, as well as student- faculty dinners once a semester. Most prominent among Mather social gatherings is the Mather Lather, a College-wide foam party that takes place every spring in the dining hall. Since its first run in 2003, the Lather has grown in scope and fame, earning the attention of the Boston media and The New York Times. The Louie Cup is a year-long Olympics-like tournament of games that takes place in the House. Generally, an event is held every week in which one or more representatives of each team (comprising a group of 4-6, usually roommates) competes. The games include a pancake-eating contest, foosball, a dining hall version of Iron Chef, and hot pepper-eating, as well as a wiffle ball home run derby, ping pong, Wii sports, dodgeball, and boggle. The events are open to the campus but tend to take place in Mather. The tournament is named after Louie's Superette, a convenience store across the street from Mather House, and a large quantity of alcohol is awarded to the winning team at the end of the spring semester. The house's well-known rivalry with Kirkland House has sparked heated exchanges of practical jokes and pranks. While Mather is generally seen as the instigator and aggressor, the rivalry began when a number of Mather students transferred to Kirkland House. Mather won the Harvard Green Campus Initiative Green Cup in 2006 and 2011 and the Greenest HoCo award in 2008.

Biography Bobby Jones was one of the most admired defenders ever to wear an NBA uniform; he was also considered one of the most virtuous. While most other players depended on the occasional thrown elbow, hip-check, or grab of the uniform to gain an advantage, Jones relied on hustle and determination. It was Jones‚Äô stellar defense along with his other specialties such as leadership, that made him a standout sixth man. Opposing teams could ill afford to relax on defense when Jones came off the bench, and they also had to work a lot harder on offense to get the ball in or even near the basket. Jones's coaches would marvel that he was so good at things they had trouble getting many other players to do at all, such as blocking shots, moving without the ball, hustling back on defense, tipping passes, diving after loose balls, and giving up an open outside shot so a teammate could hit from inside‚Äîall things that rarely, if ever, show up in a box score. Jones was as unselfish as a player could be, so much so that coaches had to implore him to take more shots. What that work added up to was a 12-year pro career that featured eight selections to the NBA All-Defensive First Team; the first-ever NBA Sixth Man Award; membership on the ABA All-Rookie Team; four appearances in the NBA All-Star Game and one in the ABA All-Star Game; and perhaps most prized, an NBA Championship with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1983. Above all, Jones's value as a player was evidenced by the fact that his teams never missed the playoffs. \\"Bobby Jones gives you two hours of his blood, showers and goes home,\\" former Sixers General Manager Pat Williams told NBA Today. \\"If I was going to ask a youngster to model after someone, I would pick Bobby Jones.\\" Added longtime 76ers teammate Julius Erving, \\"He's a player who's totally selfless, who runs like a deer, jumps like a gazelle, plays with his head and heart each night, and then walks away from the court as if nothing happened.\\" As for his almost polite approach to the game, Jones believed that anything less would have been downright un- Christian. \\"If I have to play defense by holding on, that's when I quit,\\" Jones said early in his career. \\"If I have to use an elbow to get position, then I‚Äôm going to have to settle for another position. And if I foul, or if the official makes a mistake, there's no use screaming about it. It won‚Äôt change things or make me happier.\\" On one of the few occasions Jones did address a referee, it was to point out that the official had called a foul on the wrong player: it was Jones, not a teammate, who was the guilty party. The trusting ref changed his call and assigned the foul to Jones‚Äîhis fifth of the game. Larry Brown, Jones's coach with the Denver Nuggets, remarked, \\"Watching Bobby Jones on the basketball court is like watching an honest man in a liars‚Äô poker game.\\" The 6-foot-9 forward played with an almost boyish respect for the game, its rules, and its traditions. He always raised his hand when called for a foul. When Nuggets teammate Paul Silas showed him a less-than-legal way to get a rebounding position, Jones said no thanks. \\"For veterans like Paul, I consider that executive privilege,\\" Jones said. \\"But that's not my game.\\" As for vices such as drinking, smoking, and cursing, they were out of the question. When a computer-generated ranking sponsored by Seagram Distillers rated Jones the NBA's \\"most consistent and productive player\\" in 1976‚Äì77, Jones turned over the $10,000 prize to religious charities. At the award dinner (held without alcohol at Jones's request) he pronounced from the podium: \\"I‚Äôm definitely against whiskey, and I just felt God gave me this money not to keep, but to use.\\" And while he never asked teammates or coaches to avoid expletives, they frequently found themselves crying out \\"Oh, shoot!\\" in his presence. Jones also brought to the game the demeanor and expression of a bank teller. Nothing seemed to disturb him; the final buzzer meant the end of just another day on the job. \\"He has a rare ability to divorce himself from the games after they end,\\" Dean Smith, Jones's coach at North Carolina, told the Philadelphia Daily News in 1984. \\"He is a man at peace with himself. It's what I term internal affirmation‚Äîand in Bobby, it's strong.\\" Physically, Jones was lucky to be playing any sport at all. He suffers from asthma as well as occasional epileptic seizures and a chronic heart disorder, both of which require medication. Stricken by a seizure in his kitchen one day, Jones fell onto a butcher block and gashed open his head. The incident nearly led him to quit basketball for the clergy. His perseverance earned him Philadelphia's Most Courageous Athlete Award in 1983. While his limitations would have shelved many a player of lesser faith, they never forced Jones to appear in fewer than 70 games in any one season. And he never played with less than full commitment. With his long arms, lanky body, great leaping ability, and quick hands and feet, there seemed to be three of him on the court at the same time. Contemplative and unflappable, Jones rarely threw the ball away or took an ill-conceived shot. His career field-goal percentage of .550 is among the highest ever for an NBA forward. Strangely, Jones was never in love with the sport of basketball. As a kid growing up in North Carolina, he essentially had to play. His father had played on the Oklahoma Sooners national championship runner-up team of 1949, and older brother Kirby was an All-State cager and later a Sooner as well. Since Kirby versus Mr. Jones did not make for many close matches, Bobby was invariably enlisted to join them in their games behind the house. \\"I didn‚Äôt enjoy sports,\\" Jones remembered. \\"I would rather watch television, but my father wanted me to play.\\" In the sixth grade Jones unwillingly played for a local church team that was looking for tall kids. On his junior high team he sat on the bench much of the time because he was a poor dribbler and shooter. Whenever he made it into the game, he focused on rebounding, defense, and passing. \\"I didn‚Äôt want the ball,\\" he remembered, \\"and as soon as I got it, I passed off.\\" Jones, a natural left-hander, was also working on his right hand‚Äîmainly at his father's behest. (By the time he reached the NBA, he was virtually ambidextrous.) As a sophomore at South Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte, the 6-foot-6 Jones made the basketball team. His brother Kirby was also on the squad. Bobby actually liked track and field better, because he could practice by himself and on his own terms. Twice he won the state high jump title, finishing second in his junior year to a prep named Bob McAdoo. As a senior, Jones broke the state record by clearing the bar at a height of 6 feet, 8 inches. Jones blossomed on the court in his junior year, earning Charlotte's Player of the Year Award and leading South Mecklenburg into the state playoffs. His squad lost to a Greensboro team that starred McAdoo, but South Mecklenburg won the championship a year later. Still, with all of his success as a cager, Jones did not think much about a future in basketball. \\"It was a seasonal thing,\\" he said, \\"but the colleges became interested, so I thought it was a way I could go to school free.\\" Jones ended up playing for Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina. Jones had a splendid year as a college sophomore, then doctors discovered that he had an irregular heartbeat. Their prescription: a few weeks‚Äô rest. (Jones later had to take medication before every game to control the problem.) At around the same time, tryouts for the 1972 U.S. Olympic Team were about to be held. Jones was not only unaware of the trials, but he also did not know that the Games were being staged in Munich. When Smith heard that a couple of players had been taken ill at the tryouts, he got on the phone and got Jones a shot. Jones made the team but had little time on the court, playing only 5 minutes in the Soviet Union's infamous win over the United States in the gold medal game. The American Basketball Association's Carolina Cougars selected Jones after his junior season in the 1973 Special Circumstances Draft, but Jones wanted to finish his psychology degree and polish his game, so he returned to North Carolina for his senior year. He turned in an All-America campaign in 1973‚Äì74, averaging 16.1 points, and was selected by the Houston Rockets with the fifth overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft. Meanwhile, the Cougars franchise was moved to Missouri after the 1973‚Äì74 season and became the Spirits of St. Louis. Former Carolina Coach Larry Brown had moved on to the Denver Nuggets, and he was hell-bent on getting his hands on Jones. After acquiring his rights from St. Louis in exchange for the rights to Marvin Barnes, the Nuggets outbid Houston for Jones's services, offering him a seven-year, $1.4-million contract. With Brown at the reins and Jones in the frontcourt, Denver went 65-19 in 1974‚Äì75, the best record in the ABA that year and the second-best mark in league history. Jones shot .604 from the floor for an ABA record, scored 14.8 points per game, and won a spot on the ABA All-Rookie Team. In 1975‚Äì76, the ABA's final season, Jones averaged 14.9 points and 9.5 rebounds and again topped the circuit in field-goal percentage at .581. He also played in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game and was named to the All-ABA Second Team. The Nuggets, with stars David Thompson and Dan Issel, finished with a league-best 60-24 record. Jones made a graceful transition to the NBA with the ABA‚ÄìNBA merger in June 1976, as did the rest of the Nuggets. Denver shocked the more established circuit by winning the Midwest Division that season and the next year as well. Thompson was an offensive machine, and Jones made solid contributions at both ends of the floor. In 1976‚Äì77 he averaged a career-high 15.1 points, ranked third in the league with a .570 field-goal percentage, and played in his first NBA All-Star Game. He also outpolled all other players in earning the first of eight straight selections to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. The following season Jones averaged 14.5 points, elevated his field-goal percentage to a league-leading .578, and returned to the All-Star Game. Nuggets management, however, feared Jones would be limited by his health problems. After the 1977‚Äì78 campaign he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers with Ralph Simpson for forward George McGinnis. McGinnis lasted a year and a half in Denver; Jones went on to play eight seasons in Philadelphia. Primarily a starter during his four seasons with the Nuggets, Jones was forced to make yet another transition after his first year with the Sixers. Coach Billy Cunningham thought Jones would be best utilized as a sixth man, coming off the bench for frontcourtmen Julius Erving, Darryl Dawkins, and Caldwell Jones. Cunningham was worried that the change would devastate Jones, but it took Jones about half a minute to agree to the coach's plan. Certificate presented to Jones for NBA All-Defensive honors in 1981‚Äì82. During his first two seasons coming off the bench, beginning with the 1979‚Äì80 campaign, Jones still averaged about 25 minutes and 13 to 14 points, shooting at least .530 from the floor each year. He returned to the NBA All-Star Game in both 1981 and 1982 and was an All-Defensive First Team selection each year. In 1981-82, Bobby Jones briefly returned to the starting lineup for that season, starting 73 games. With their system working to near perfection, the 76ers went to the Finals twice during the period, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in both 1980 and 1982. The arrival of workhorse center Moses Malone from Houston prior to the 1982‚Äì83 campaign proved to be the final piece of the championship puzzle. In the regular season Malone repeated as league MVP, and Jones won the first- ever NBA Sixth Man Award. Philadelphia then romped through the playoffs, eventually sweeping the Lakers in the 1983 NBA Finals. During that 1983 playoff run, a Philadelphia Inquirer article on Jones paraphrased the famous John Havlicek call by Johnny Most stating, \\"Bobby Jones stole the ball. It was grand larceny. Bobby Jones stole the ball and robbed the Milwaukee Bucks of a game, turning an almost-sure upset into a 111-109 overtime victory for the 76ers.\\"‚Äì Philadelphia Inquirer ‚Äì May 9, 1983 ‚Äì JONES STEALS ONE FOR THE SIXERS  Philly.com The Sixers began a steady decline after that championship year, finishing second to Boston the next three seasons. Jones turned in steady defense and solid numbers during those years, although his playing time and production tailed off gradually. Still, he was as efficient as ever. In his last season, 1985‚Äì86, Jones shot .559 from the floor. He retired at age 34, and the Sixers retired his uniform No. 24 shortly afterward. Jones left the NBA as one of the most admired players of the era, if not of all time. Said a young Charles Barkley while a teammate of Jones's, \\"If everyone in the world was like Bobby Jones, the world wouldn‚Äôt have any problems.\\" In 2003, Jones cofounded a Charlotte, North Carolina-based religiously affiliated non-profit, 2xsalt, that supports underprivileged youth through sports, along with Bart Kofoed and former teammate and Hall of Famer David Thompson. Bobby Jones is now coaching the middle school boys basketball team at Carmel Christian School in Charlotte. During his entire tenure with the Sixers, his jersey always included the letter B with a period before his last name (B. JONES) above his number 24; he still wore it even after former teammate Caldwell Jones was traded for Moses Malone in 1982 and Caldwell's brother Charles left after only one season with the Sixers (1983‚Äì84). However, during the 2008 season, as part of the Sixers' 25th anniversary of the 1983 Champions, he was given a framed replica jersey that simply states his last name without the letter B, since he was the only Sixer named Jones to play on the 1983 team. On April 6, 2019 Jones was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. On January 28, 2020 Joel Embiid asked and was granted permission by Bobby Jones to wear his retired jersey number 24 for the Sixers, in honor of the late Kobe Bryant.

The company's stated core business is to provide consulting, analysis and engineering services to public and private sector organizations and nonprofits. History Founding fathers from left to right: George Fry, Edwin Booz, Carl Hamilton, and James Allen =Beginnings= The company that was to become Booz Allen was founded in 1914, in Evanston, Illinois, when Northwestern University graduate Edwin G. Booz founded the Business Research Service. The service was based on Booz's theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.Booz Allen History. Boozallen.com. Retrieved on June 25, 2013. Booz's service attracted a number of clients, such as Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Chicago's Union Stockyards and Transit Company, and the Canadian Pacific Railway. During the following three decades, the company went through a number of name changes and business models, eventually settling to Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton, named after their partnership in 1936. Before Fry's departure in 1942, the company's name was changed again to Booz Allen Hamilton. = Post-War era = In general, the post-war era saw a shift in the company's client pool, with many contracts coming from governmental institutions and different branches of the Armed Forces. Edwin G. Booz died in 1951. The company received its first international contract two years later, in 1953, to help reorganize land- ownership records for the newly established Philippines government. The partnership was dissolved in 1962 and the company was registered as a private corporation. In 1998, Booz Allen Hamilton developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories.Booz Allen's Sweet Spot, November 24, 2002 = 21st century = Bloomberg named it \\"the world's most profitable spy organization\\". According to an Information Week piece from 2002, Booz Allen had \\"more than one thousand former intelligence officers on its staff\\". According to its own website, the company employs more than 10,000 personnel who have cleared TS/SCI background checks. In 2008, the commercial arm of Booz Allen split off to form Booz & Company. In 2013, Booz & Company was acquired by PwC and renamed Strategy&. Since then, Booz Allen has re-entered commercial markets. In 2010, Booz Allen went public with an initial public offering of 14,000,000 shares at $17 per share. In 2012, Booz Allen purchased the Defense Systems Engineering & Support division of ARINC, adding approximately 1,000 new employees to its roster. In 2014, Booz Allen acquired Epidemico. In 2015, Booz Allen acquired the software development division of the Charleston, S.C. technology firm SPARC. In 2017, Booz Allen acquired eGov Holdings. In 2018, the SEC awarded both Booz Allen and Attain a $2.5 billion contract to modernize how the SEC purchases IT services. In February 2020, the company became the SEC's major provider of cybersecurity services by securing a 10-year contract worth $113 million. Research and publications Booz Allen has been credited with developing several business concepts. In 1957, Sam Johnson, great grandson of the S.C. Johnson & Son founder, and Booz Allen's Conrad Jones published How to Organize for New Products which discussed theories on product life-cycle management. In 1958, Gordon Pehrson, deputy director of U.S. Navy Special Projects Office, and Bill Pocock of Booz Allen Hamilton developed the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). In 1982, Booz Allen's Keith Oliver coined the term \\"supply chain management\\". In 2013, Booz Allen's Mark Herman, Stephanie Rivera, Steven Mills, and Michael Kim published the Field Guide to Data Science. A second edition was published in 2015. In 2017, Booz Allen's Josh Sullivan and Angela Zutavern published The Mathematical Corporation.  Controversies and leaks  Booz Allen office, Washington, D.C. =SWIFT= In 2006, at the request of the Article 29 Working Party (an advisory group to the European Commission), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Privacy International (PI) investigated the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program, and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation, which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.Booz Allen's Extensive Ties to Government Raise More Questions About SWIFT Surveillance Program.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed. According to the article, > In a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information > analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely > waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, > the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the > flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal > employees who might do the job for less. Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held. =2011 Anonymous hack= On July 11, 2011 the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,Bora, Kukil. \\"Why Did Anonymous Hack Booz Allen Hamilton, Release 90K U.S. Military E-mails?\\" International Business Times.

The Washington Times. Friday June 21, 2013. Retrieved on June 27, 2013. According to CNBC, these contributions resulted in a steady stream of government contracts, which puts Booz Allen in privileged position. Due to the company's important government services, ‚Äúthe government is unlikely to let the company go out of business. It's too connected to fail‚Äù. Furthermore, the influence Booz Allen carries in Washington isn't restricted to donations, but to a large network of lobbyists and political insiders. According to government watchdog OpenSecrets, ‚Äú4 out of 6 Booz Allen Hamilton lobbyists in 2015-2016 have previously held government jobs‚Äù. Activities in foreign countries In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R.

Alongside competitors McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group, Booz Allen are seen as important factors in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman‚Äôs drive to consolidate power in the Kingdom. On the military side, Booz Allen is employing dozens of retired American military personnel to train and advise the Royal Saudi Navy and provide logistics for the Saudi Army, but denies its expertise is used by Saudi Arabia in its war against Yemen. Additionally, it also entered an agreement with the Saudi government that involves the protection and cyber-security of government ministries, with experts arguing that these defensive maneuvers could easily be used to target dissidents.

The displacement 90¬∞ V-twin motorcycles were aimed to compete directly with the Honda VTR1000F (also known as the SuperHawk or FireStorm, depending on the market), which was released prior to the Suzuki, and the low end Ducati one-litre V-twin engined sport bikes. The SV1000 is the larger version of the popular 650 cc SV650 motorcycle. The SV1000 shares many common parts with the SV650, including all bodywork (front fairing, fuel tank and rear plastics/subframe), but the main frame, handlebars, swingarm and forks are different. The front forks and brakes are sourced from the earlier GSX-R600. The SV1000's engine is sourced from the TL1000S which, inside were over 300 changes to improve low-end and midrange performance. Unlike the Firestorm/SuperHawk, which had large 48 mm carburettors, the 2003 and later SV1000 was fuel injected and had Suzuki's 'Dual-Throttle Valve' technology. In 2004, the ergonomics were revised, with lower pegs and a slightly lower seat height, matching the 2003 N model (unfaired). The compression was increased slightly in the 2005 and 2006 models, and a few other internal items were changed, otherwise remained the same bike as the 2003 model. The original SV1000 design (K3) has gone through two updates since its original release: The K4 model - Includes a lowering of the rear-end (as per the 2003 unfaired version), the forks on the 03-04 were replaced with cheaper non-rebuildable cartridge forks. The K5 model - Black frame, black wheels, shorter airbox trumpet, larger throttle bodies (now 54mm), higher-lift cams, a lighter flywheel, and a higher compression ratio as well as a new ECU. In some markets, Suzuki carries the SZ version with full fairing and GSX-R colour scheme. The K6 model - New selection of colours. Neither 1000-engined bike sold well, even though the similar 650 cc displacement bikes are award winners and very popular. Suzuki stopped selling the SV1000 naked version in the US in 2004, while the S half fairing version continued through 2007 and by 2008 neither model was listed on the company's global web site.

It belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae s.l.. The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. It includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder to the edible oraches. The name saltbush derives from the fact that the plants retain salt in their leaves; they are able to grow in areas affected by soil salination.  Description  Atriplex patula, female flower with bracteoles and seed The species in genus Atriplex are annual or perennial herbs, subshrubs, or shrubs. The plants are often covered with bladderlike hairs, that later collapse and form a silvery, scurfy or mealy surface, rarely with elongate trichomes. The alternate or rarely opposite leaves are petiolate or sessile, often persistent or tardily deciduous. The flat or slightly fleshy leaf blades are either entire, or serrate, or lobed and very variable in shape. The inflorescences consist of axillary or terminal spikes or spicate panicles, or axillary clusters of glomeruled flowers. The flowers are unisexual, some species are monoecious, others dioecious. Male flowers consist of 3-5 perianth lobes and 3-5 stamens. Female flowers are usually lacking a perianth, but are enclosed by 2 foliaceous bracteoles, and contain an ovary with a short style and 2 stigmas. In fruit, the bracteoles can enlarge, thicken or become appendaged. They enclose the fruit tightly, without becoming connate to it. The pericarp is adnate to the vertically orientated, flattened seed. The seed coat is thick, leathery or hardening. The annular embryo surrounds the perisperm. The chromosome base number is x = 9, except for Atriplex lanfrancoi, which is x=10. A few Atriplex species are C3-plants, but most species are C4-plants, with a characteristic leaf anatomy (kranz anatomy).  Distribution and evolution  The genus Atriplex is distributed nearly worldwide from subtropical to temperate and to subarctic regions. Most species-rich are Australia, North America, South America and Eurasia. Many species are halophytes and are adapted to dry environments with salty soils. The genus evolved in Middle Miocene, the C4-photosynthesis pathway developed about 14.1-10.9 million years ago, when the climate became increasingly dry. The genus diversified rapidly and spread over the continents. The C4Atriplex colonized North America probably from Eurasia during the Middle/Late Miocene, about 9.8-8.8 million years ago, and later spread to South America. Australia was colonized twice by two C4 lineages, one from Eurasia or America about 9.8-7.8 million years ago, and one from Central Asia about 6.3-4.8 million years ago. The last lineage diversified rapidly, and became the ancestor of most Australian Atriplex species.  Ecology  Atriplex species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species; see the list of Lepidoptera which feed on Atriplex. For spiders such as Phidippus californicus and other arthropods, saltbush plants offer opportunities to hide and hunt in habitat that is otherwise often quite barren. It has been proposed that genus Atriplex was a main food source in the diet of the extinct giant kangaroo Procoptodon goliah. Stable isotopic data suggested that their diet consisted of plants that used the C4 photosynthetic pathway, and due to their semi-arid distribution, chenopod saltbushes were likely responsible.  Use by humans  The favored species for human consumption is now usually garden orache (A. hortensis), but many species are edible and the use of Atriplex as food is known since at least the late Epipaleolithic (Mesolithic). Common orache (A. patula) is attested as an archaeophyte in northern Europe, and the Erteb√∏lle culture is presumed to have used it as a food. Its seed has been found among apparent evidence of cereal preparation and cooking at Late Iron Age villages in Britain. In the biblical Book of Job, mall√ªa·∏• (◊û÷∑◊ú÷º÷£◊ï÷º◊ó÷∑, probably Mediterranean saltbush, A. halimus, the major culinary saltbush in the region) is mentioned as food eaten by social outcasts (Mistranslated as \\"mallows\\" in the King James Bible and as Nesseln (nettles) in the Luther Bible). Grey saltbush (A. cinerea) has been used as bushfood in Australia since prehistoric times. Chamiso (A. canescens) and shadscale (A. confertifolia) were eaten by Native Americans, and spearscale (A. hastata) was a food in rural Eurasia. Studies on Atriplex species demonstrated their potential use in agriculture. Meat from sheep which have grazed on saltbush has surprisingly high levels of vitamin E, is leaner and more hydrated than regular lamb and has consumer appeal equal to grain-fed lamb. The vitamin E levels could have animal health benefits while extending the shelf-life and maintaining the fresh red colour of saltbush lamb. This effect has been demonstrated for old man saltbush (A. nummularia) and river saltbush (A. amnicola). For reasons unknown, sheep seem to prefer the more fibrous, less nutritious river saltbush. A study on Atriplex nummularia discovered the species have a nitrogen content of 2.5-3.5%, and could potentially be used as a protein supplement for grazing if palatable. A subsequent study allowed sheep and goats to voluntarily feed on Atriplex halimus and aimed to determine if the saltbush was palatable, and if so, did it provide enough nutrients to supplement the diet of these animals. In this study they determined when goats and sheep are given as much A. halimus as they like, they do obtain enough nutrients to supplement their diet ‚Äì unless the animal requirements are higher during pregnancy and milk production. Saltbushes are also used as an ornamental plant in landscaping and can be used to prevent soil erosion in coastal areas. Old man saltbush (Atriplex nummularia) has also been successfully used to rehabilitate old mining sites around Lightning Ridge (Australia).

The type species (lectotype) is Atriplex hortensis. The name is derived from Ancient Greek ·ºÄœÑœÅŒ¨œÜŒ±ŒæœÖœÇ (atraphaxys), \\"orach\\", itself a Pre-Greek substrate loanword. Atriplex is an extremely species-rich genus and comprises about 250-300 species. Traditional taxonomy of Atripliceae based on morphological features has been controversial. Molecular studies have found that many genera are not true clades. One such study found that Atripliceae could be divided into two main clades, Archiatriplex, with a few, scattered species, and the larger Atriplex clade, which is highly diverse and found around the world. After phylogenetical research, Kadereit et al. (2010) excluded Halimione as a distinct sister genus. The remaining Atriplex species were grouped into several clades. The following is a cladogram with estimated divergence times for the tribe Atripliceae. Initially inferred using BEAST. Not all species in the genus Atriplex are presented in the cladogram.

She served as a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1995. Background Poole has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Trent University, and was a law clerk and social worker before entering political life. She also served as chair of the Women's Perspective Advisory Committee, and was a member of the French Immersion Task Force of the Toronto Board of Education. Politics Poole ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1985 general election, losing to Progressive Conservative David McFadden by 914 votes in the Toronto constituency of Eglinton. She ran again in the 1987 provincial election, and defeated McFadden by 695 votes amid a landslide victory for the Liberals. In 1989, she was appointed as a parliamentary assistant. The Liberals were defeated by the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, and Poole was re-elected by only 173 votes over Progressive Conservative candidate Ann Vanstone. She served as the Liberal critic for Housing from 1990 to 1993, and for the JobsOntario program from 1993 to 1995. In 1994, Poole was one of only three Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPPs), along with Jean Poirier and Tim Murphy, who supported Bill 167, a bill brought forward by the government of Bob Rae to extend spousal benefits to same-sex couples. Poole also called for the Ontario Film Review Board to impose greater restrictions on sexually explicit and violent materials entering the country. She was generally regarded as being on the left wing of the party. The narrow margin of Poole's victory in 1990 made her constituency a prime PC target in 1995. She lost to Progressive Conservative fundraiser Bill Saunderson by about 4,500 votes, as the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government provincially. After leaving politics, Poole became the president of Politrain, Inc. She supported Gerard Kennedy for the Liberal Party leadership in 1996.

The UK Singles Downloads Chart is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the music industry. Since July 2015, the chart week runs from Friday to Thursday, with the chart date given as the following Thursday. The main chart contains the Top 200 downloads (which are published in UKChartsPlus), with the top 100 published on the OCC website. The chart only uses sales of permanent digital downloads, that is single-download tracks on non-subscription online music stores. Some downloading services offer a monthly fee plan where generally an unlimited number of tracks can be downloaded within a month for a certain price. Tracks downloaded in those instances do not qualify. An album equivalent, the UK Album Downloads Chart, was launched in April 2006. History Before the inauguration of the download chart, only sales of physical formats‚Äîsuch as CD, vinyl and cassette tape‚Äîcontributed towards a single's position on the UK music charts. From the late 1990s onwards, these sales began to significantly decline. By the start of 2004, they had dropped to their lowest level in over 35 years, with singles needing to sell only 35,000 copies to reach number one. One year later, a limited edition re- release of \\"One Night\\" / \\"I Got Stung\\" by Elvis Presley topped the chart with 22,000 copies, making it the lowest selling number-one single at that time. Conversely, the music download market was growing considerably: during the same 2004‚Äì05 period, sales of downloads grew by 743%, and overtook physical sales in December 2004. The following year, the UK's online music revenue reached . As a result of this growth, the OCC were commissioned in 2004 to compile a new music chart based solely on the UK's download sales, which was initially sponsored by Coca-Cola. A \\"sample\\" download chart was trialled for 10 weeks, with the first number one being \\"Bam Thwok\\" by American rock band Pixies. After this ten-week period, the UK Official Download Chart was launched on 1 September 2004, with Irish boy band Westlife achieving the first official number one. The group topped the chart with a live version of their 1999 single \\"Flying Without Wings\\", a move that UK chart commentator James Masterton branded a \\"stunt\\". Sales of downloaded singles were finally incorporated into the UK Singles Chart on 17 April 2005, initially on the condition that physical copies were available to buy at the same time. In April 2006, the UK Official Download Chart was expanded to include an album chart. The first album to top the chart was This New Day by English alternative rock band Embrace. By 2007, the UK had become Europe's largest consumer of online music, with almost 78 million tracks being downloaded that year ‚Äì by 2012 this figure had more than doubled. The single with the longest stay on the Downloads Chart is \\"Crazy\\" by Gnarls Barkley, which stayed the top spot for 11 weeks. On the week end 26 December 2009, \\"Killing in the Name\\" by Rage Against the Machine became the fastest-selling download of all time. As of 9 September 2014, \\"Happy\\" by Pharrell Williams is the most downloaded song in UK music download history. In 2006, McFly became the first band to have two number one singles with \\"Star Girl\\" on both the UK Downloads Chart and the UK Singles Chart at the same time. Criteria for inclusion * The track must have a maximum playing time of 15 minutes. * PDDs (Permanent Digital Downloads) must be bought by the retailer at a minimum of 40p per track, or 32p if the record company does not publish a set dealer price.

The teleplay was written by Richard Manning and Hans Beimler, based on a story by Beimler. The episode was directed by Les Landau. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the crew investigates the disappearance of the USS Drake. They travel to the planet Minos, where an away team and the ship are separately attacked by the demonstration of an automated weapons system. Maurice Hurley saw the episode as commentary on the sale of F-14 Tomcats to Iran. He intended to have Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) reveal her feelings for Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in this episode, but Gene Roddenberry had it changed. VFX Supervisor/Producer Dan Curry created the model of the drone seen in this episode using a pantyhose container and a shampoo bottle. The opinions of critics were mixed, but singled out the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli for praise. Plot The Enterprise has been sent to the Lorenze Cluster to search for the USS Drake after it vanished while surveying the planet Minos, which many years ago became wealthy by selling weapons. When the ship reaches the planet, they are met by a recorded holographic figure (Vincent Schiavelli) advertising \\"The Arsenal of Freedom\\", which invites the crew to the surface. Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and Lieutenant Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) beam down to the surface to investigate. Riker is met by Captain Rice of the Drake, but determines the captain is an imposter and feeds him false information. After further questions, the \\"captain\\" disappears, revealing a floating sentry probe, which fires a stasis field around Riker before Data and Yar can destroy it. The Enterprise cannot beam Riker through the stasis field, so Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) travel to the surface, and Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) is left in command of the Enterprise. As Picard and Crusher attempt to free Riker, another sentry probe appears and fires on them. Picard and Crusher are separated from Data and Yar in the skirmish and fall into a pit, severely injuring Crusher. Meanwhile, Data and Yar discover that the second probe is more powerful than the first and requires their combined power to destroy it. While Picard tends to Crusher's injuries, Data manages to release Riker from the stasis field. Riker, Yar and Data are again attacked, with this new probe requiring even more phaser power to destroy it. Data deduces that each probe learns from the previous probes' experiences and adapts to become stronger, and that the next probe might be unbeatable. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is fired upon by a cloaked attacker, with each subsequent attack stronger than the last, straining the ship's shields. Chief Engineer Lt. Logan (Vyto Ruginis) goes to the bridge to demand that the Enterprise flee the planet and attempts to take command, as he outranks La Forge, but La Forge refuses, pointing out that Logan lacks the authority to remove him, and orders him to return to Engineering. As the attacks continue, La Forge recalls Logan to the bridge and orders a saucer separation, leaving Logan in charge of the saucer, and taking command of the star-drive section from the battle bridge himself to return to Minos. Still underground, Picard discovers a computer terminal, which he activates, causing a hologram of the salesman to appear and explain they are witnessing a demonstration of an intelligent weapon system which is able to upgrade in response to any enemy threat. Picard surmises that the Minosians and the Drake were destroyed by the weapons. He unsuccessfully attempts to coerce the hologram to end the demonstration. Data is able to locate Picard, and determines that while the sentries could be set to destroy their own power source, the resulting explosion would probably take out the whole area, including the away-team. Picard finally tells the salesman he will buy the system, causing the salesman to disappear and the probes on the planet to shut down. Meanwhile, La Forge uses the planet's atmosphere to reveal the location of the space-born probe and destroys it. The away team returns to the star-drive section, where Picard allows La Forge to stay in command until they rendezvous with the saucer section, remarking that he left him with the ship intact and would like it returned in the same condition. Production Story editor Maurice Hurley saw the plot of \\"The Arsenal of Freedom\\" as commentary on the sale of American Grumman F-14 Tomcats to Iran taken to the \\"ultimate conclusion\\". In 1974, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi purchased 80 Tomcats and missiles for $2 billion. That transaction prevented Grumman from going into bankruptcy as the United States Congress was no longer funding the project. Iran was the only country other than the United States to use the planes. The original story had Picard injured, and Crusher revealing her feelings for him while trying to save him from dying. However the show's creator Gene Roddenberry did not want to do a love story and so it was changed.Gross; Altman (1993): p. 166 Les Landau made the suggestion to switch around the roles of Picard and Crusher in order to take them out of their elements.Nemecek (2003): p. 53 Landau had been an assistant director on staff, and became the first member of the production team to direct an episode with \\"The Arsenal of Freedom\\". The model of the drone was created by Dan Curry, from a L'eggs pantyhose container and a shampoo bottle. He hand animated the model instead of using motion control photography, using his years of Tai Chi training to keep the movements fluid.Nemecek (2003): p. 54 In order to blend into the background, he wore a pair of green tights whilst he was manually moving the model on screen. Reception \\"The Arsenal of Freedom\\" first aired in broadcast syndication on April 11, 1988. It received a 10.4 rating, meaning that it was seen by 10.4 percent of all households. This was the first new episode for three weeks, the previous episode, \\"Heart of Glory\\" receiving a rating of 10.7. Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He highlighted the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli, saying that he \\"totally owns every scene he‚Äôs in\\". He thought that the situation which left La Forge in charge of the Enterprise was \\"horribly contrived\\" and said \\"Picard doesn‚Äôt even give a good excuse for going down to the planet beyond the script calling for it\\". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten, summing up that it was a \\"fun, enjoyable, diverting episode\\". Zack Handlen reviewed the episode in May 2010 for The A.V. Club. He criticised the episode, saying that there \\"are all kinds of problems, the biggest being that the episode doesn't really have a third act, but the moral superiority of the crew is on full display, and it's frustrating.\\" He summed up the moral story played out in this episode, saying that \\"On TOS, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy would've hashed out the appeal of an unbeatable weapon as well as its drawbacks. Here, we're all supposed to know that violence begets violence, and that's it.\\" He gave the episode a grade of C+. James Hunt watched the episode for the website Den of Geek in March 2013. He recalled it being a good episode, but found it wasn't as good on the re-watch for the review. He thought that the plot seemed reminiscent of the plot of a Philip K. Dick novel, but thought that the away team sequences on the planet were a little boring with the exception of Data jumping down into the pit where Picard and Crusher were. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for the website TrekNation in August 2007. She thought that the scenario with La Forge was the most forced but described Vincent Schiavelli as a \\"treat\\". She said that the cast otherwise didn't get to stretch much, but was pleased with the visuals where the star-drive section enters the planet's atmosphere. Releases \\"The Arsenal of Freedom\\" was released on DVD on region one as part of the Season one set on March 26, 2002 with the sound remastered to Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround standards, and a series of interviews with the cast and crew were included on the sixth disc.

Invented by Dr. Ioannis Pallikaris (Crete, Greece), the technique is basically an automatic LASEK without alcohol; it can be better considered as superficial LASIK. The stromal bed is smoother than that obtained by mechanical methods or brush. Unlike alcohol (LASEK), there is no chance of damaging the limbal stem cells. It is also relatively less painful than LASEK. # A device similar to a microkeratome (called epi-keratome) slides over the surface of the cornea, just underneath the epithelial layer of cells while suction is applied. # The result is a hinged sheet of epithelium that is at least partially viable. # It is reflected out of the way so that the ablation can take place. # The sheet is repositioned and a bandage soft contact lens is placed on the eye. Recent studies show that the surface epithelial layer of the cornea heals faster if the epithelial sheet is removed at the end of surgery.Na KS, Lee KM, Park SH, Lee HS, Joo Ck.

He was christened with the three names Jean, Baptiste, and Eug√®ne, but disliked the name Baptiste, and preferred to be addressed as Eug√®ne. He usually signed himself J.E. Estienne. See Mondet, Arlette Estienne: Le g√©n√©ral J.B.E. Estienne, p√®re des chars. L'Harmattan, 2010 (7 November 1860 in Cond√©-en-Barrois, Meuse ‚Äì 2 April 1936 in Paris) was a general of artillery and a specialist in military engineering, one of the founders of modern French artillery and French military aviation, and the creator of the French tank arm. He is considered by many in France to be the P√®re des Chars (Father of the Tank). Early life Estienne was born at Cond√© en Barrois (now Les Hauts-de-Ch√©e) in the Meuse valley. He was admitted to the √âcole Polytechnique (the French Military Academy) at the age of nineteen. He graduated 131st of his year in 1882, the same year he won first prize in the national mathematics competition. He would for the rest of his life be interested in mathematical and philosophical problems, but his real passion was Greek Antiquity. Military careerModern artillery= He joined the French army as a second lieutenant in 1883, serving with the artillery from 1884. Studying ballistics, he presented his first major work in 1890, Erreurs d'Observation, to the Acad√©mie des Sciences; this stimulated the introduction of modern indirect fire methods. Promoted to Captain with the 1st Artillery Regiment in 1891, he began to develop telemetric instruments at the Bourges arsenal to put his theories into practice. He was made squadron commander with the 19th Artillery Regiment in 1902, but his real work was done as head of the workshop building precision instruments for the technical artillery section in Paris, and promoting the use of telephonic connections to enable the artillery to switch targets quickly. This work did not keep him from publishing a paper on Pascal's theorem in 1906. He became head of the artillery school at Grenoble in 1907. =Military Aviation= At that time Estienne was already reputed to be one of the most competent and progressive officers in France, and one of the founders of modern artillery. When General Brun created the French aviation service at Reims in 1909, the logical candidate to command this new unit was Estienne. Since the main task of aircraft was seen as directing artillery fire, he seemed to be best qualified to solve the technological difficulties involved. So Estienne, now promoted to Lieutenant- Colonel, also became one of the founders of French military aviation. After establishing the proper organisation, training and production of aircraft while developing communication methods, he commanded the 5th Aviation Group at Lyon for a short time. But he was recalled to the arsenal of Vincennes to continue his technical work ‚Äî although he could not resist founding a new artillery aviation section there. First World War A World War I mobile personnel shield. At the outbreak of the First World War Estienne was made commander of the 22nd Artillery Regiment serving with Philippe P√©tain's division. At the Battle of Charleroi he shocked his German opponents by the precision of his artillery fire, which was well directed due to close cooperation with aircraft. But even Estienne's competence could not save the French infantry from being destroyed by machine gun fire. In order to protect soldiers in trench warfare, he imagined mobile personnel shields to assist them.Alain Gougaud L'Aube de la Gloire, Les Autos-Mitrailleuses et les Chars Fran√ßais pendant la Grande Guerre, 1987, Mus√©e des Blind√©s, , p.110 Having long been an advocate of indirect fire methods, Estienne now began to search for viable ways to provide close support with field guns. On 23 August he made his famous statement Messieurs, la victoire appartiendra dans cette guerre √† celui des deux bellig√©rants qui parviendra le premier √† placer un canon de 75 sur une voiture capable de se mouvoir en tout terrain (\\"Gentlemen, the victory in this war will belong to which of the two belligerents which will be the first to place a gun of 75 [mm] on a vehicle able to be driven on all terrain\\"). However, as suitable vehicles were lacking at the time, nothing more could be done. In the summer of 1915 he learned that Eug√®ne Brilli√© of the Schneider Company and Jules-Louis Br√©ton (then a member of parliament) were developing a barbed wire-cutter on a tracked Holt-type chassis. He wrote several letters during the autumn of 1915 to Joseph Joffre at GQG (the French GHQ) with his ideas about using such tracked vehicles. These letters never got further than Joffre's staff. On 1 December 1915 Estienne wrote a personal letter to Joffre, in which he proposed that the French army undertake a similar project. In particular, he advocated the creation of a force of all- terrain armoured vehicles large enough to assist 20,000 infantrymen to break through the full depth of a German defensive position. Armed with light artillery, the vehicles would also serve to transport men, equipment and supplies across the 40 km or so that separated French assembly areas from the open terrain behind the German defensive positions. Souain tank prototype crossing a trench on 9 December 1915. Colonel Estienne attended these decisive trials He was invited to explain his ideas further to Joffre's Deputy Chief of Staff, General Jules Janin, during a personal visit on 12 December. Three days earlier, he and P√©tain had attended a demonstration of the chassis of the Schneider CA tank. He realized that unknown to him Schneider had been constructing an armoured tracked vehicle since May, and immediately understood that the existence of such a prototype, even though incomplete, might well prove a decisive argument for the creation of an armoured force. He was proven right on 20 December when an official plan was conceived to produce the Schneider CA. The same day he contacted Louis Renault to convince him to build tanks, but the industrialist refused. During a personal visit to Joffre on 18 January 1916 he convinced the supreme commander that the plan was sound. Estienne himself was not at first personally involved in the development of the new tanks. He suggested some ideas that were duly taken notice of, but otherwise had no effect on the preparations for construction and production. Two of his personal enemies, Undersecretary Jean-Louis Br√©ton (who resented that Estienne had taken over his project) and Colonel Emile Rimailho (the co- inventor, with Deport and General St. Claire Deville, of the famous French 75 mm field gun), cooperated to build the ill-fated Saint-Chamond tank. During a chance meeting on 16 July, Renault informed him that his company was developing a light tank (the Renault FT), but Estienne was not in a position to make any promises. In August he and Br√©ton traveled together to London, where they tried to convince the British government to postpone the first use of tanks until the French tanks were ready. They were unsuccessful, but the British action had a beneficial side effect in that the first use of the British Mark I tanks on 15 September created a euphoria that accelerated developments and on 30 September Estienne was appointed Commander of the Artillerie Sp√©ciale: the French army's tank arm. He was duly promoted on 17 October. At the time there was a lack of personnel and materiel and Estienne spent many months creating the new force from scratch: first recruiting personnel, then constructing training grounds and waiting till 1 December for the first Schneider CA tank to be delivered so that training could begin in earnest. During these months he cooperated with Renault in developing the Renault FT, and tried to block efforts by General Mourret to mass-produce superheavy tanks (the later Char 2C), which threatened to swallow the available production capacity. On 16 April 1917 he was forced by the new supreme commander, Robert Nivelle, to commit his armoured force prematurely near Berry-au-Bac, leading to a complete failure. The officer commanding the attack, Commandant Louis Bossut, was killed; a large monument there commemorates all French tank crewmen who died in World War I. This disaster nearly led to the abolition of the tank force; Estienne was only saved by the appointment of his friend P√©tain as Commander-in-Chief. Estienne now directed his mind to the creation of appropriate tactics for the use of tanks. He considered that the tanks most important role was to act as mobile artillery, capable of moving over the ravaged battlefields and breaking through enemy lines, without any \\"softening up\\" artillery support. Heavier tanks might be useful for this but a more efficient effort could be made by a \\"swarm\\" of lighter and faster vehicles. Estienne paid little attention to exploitation. A large number of Renault FTs was finally made available in 1918. This allowed the French to counterattack effectively for the first time since 1914. The FT subsequently became the Char de la Victoire and the necessity for a strong tank force became firmly established. Post war Estienne submitted to P√©tain a proposal in 1919 titled Study of the Missions of Tanks in the Field. This stressed the need for armoured, tracked support vehicles to carry infantry, artillery and recovery teams alongside the tanks, and also for the need for aircraft to conduct an in-depth bombardment of the enemy. This was somewhat advanced for the time, and presaged Tukhachevsky's ideas of the 1930s. After the war Estienne held command of French tank forces until 1927, first as Artillerie Sp√©ciale, then as commander of the Chars when in 1920 all tanks were made part of the Infantry by law. At a conference in Brussels in 1921 he called for a 100,000 man force equipped with 4,000 tanks and 8,000 transport vehicles that could break an enemy's front and advance 80 km in a single night. However, the military establishment in France believed in rigid infantry-oriented warfare and his appeal went unheeded. Although politician Paul Reynaud supported progressive ideas like those of Estienne and called for a mobile army that could take the offensive as early as 1924, he represented a minority position in the French parliament. French military doctrine still relegated tanks to the role of supporting the infantry, a situation that did not change until Weygand took command. Indeed, Estienne criticized the idea of tanks supporting infantry until his death in 1936. =The Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transsaharienne= In May 1923 he was made president of the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transsaharienne (CGT), formed by Gaston Gradis to promote travel across the Sahara by car and airplane. His sons Georges and Ren√© participated in several exploratory expeditions sponsored by this company from Adrar, Algeria to Gao, Niger and further south. Legacy Estienne is revered in France as the \\"Father of the Tanks\\". Rue du G√©n√©ral Estienne in the 15th Arrondissement in Paris is named after him. Several military stations and posts have also borne his name and the largest tank museum in the world, the Mus√©e des Blind√©s in Saumur, is called \\"Mus√©e G√©n√©ral Estienne\\".

Retrieved 2016-03-15 Students learn about a subject by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to a complex question, challenge, or problem.What is PBL? Buck Institute for Education. Retrieved 2016-03-15 It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote memorization, or teacher-led instruction that presents established facts or portrays a smooth path to knowledge by instead posing questions, problems or scenarios.  History  John Dewey in 1902John Dewey is recognized as one of the early proponents of project-based education or at least its principles through his idea of \\"learning by doing\\". In My Pedagogical Creed (1897) Dewey enumerated his beliefs including the view that \\"the teacher is not in the school to impose certain ideas or to form certain habits in the child, but is there as a member of the community to select the influences which shall affect the child and to assist him in properly responding to these.John Dewey, Education and Experience, 1938/1997. New York. Touchstone. For this reason, he promoted the so-called expressive or constructive activities as the centre of correlation. Educational research has advanced this idea of teaching and learning into a methodology known as \\"project-based learning\\". William Heard Kilpatrick built on the theory of Dewey, who was his teacher, and introduced the project method as a component of Dewey's problem method of teaching. Some scholars (e.g. James G. Greeno) also associated project-based learning with Jean Piaget's \\"situated learning\\" perspectiveGreeno, J. G. (2006). Learning in activity. In R. K. Sawyer (Ed.), The Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences (pp. 79-96). New York: Cambridge University Press. and constructivist theories. Piaget advocated an idea of learning that does not focus on the memorization. Within his theory, project-based learning is considered a method that engages students to invent and to view learning as a process with a future instead of acquiring knowledge base as a matter of fact. Further developments to the project-based education as a pedagogy later drew from the experience- and perception-based theories on education proposed by theorists such as Jan Comenius, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and Maria Montessori, among others.  Concept  Thomas Markham (2011) describes project-based learning (PBL) thus: \\"PBL integrates knowing and doing. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum‚Äîa shift mandated by the global world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resiliency. These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience.\\"Markham, T. (2011). Project Based Learning. Teacher Librarian, 39(2), 38-42. Blumenfeld et al. elaborate on the processes of PBL: \\"Project- based learning is a comprehensive perspective focused on teaching by engaging students in investigation. Within this framework, students pursue solutions to nontrivial problems by asking and refining questions, debating ideas, making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking new questions, and creating artifacts.\\"Blumenfeld et al 1991, EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST, 26(3&4) 369-398 \\"Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning.\\" Phyllis C. Blumenfeld, Elliot Soloway, Ronald W. Marx, Joseph S. Krajcik, Mark Guzdial, and Annemarie Palincsar. The basis of PBL lies in the authenticity or real-life application of the research. Students working as a team are given a \\"driving question\\" to respond to or answer, then directed to create an artifact (or artifacts) to present their gained knowledge. Artifacts may include a variety of media such as writings, art, drawings, three-dimensional representations, videos, photography, or technology-based presentations. Proponents of project-based learning cite numerous benefits to the implementation of its strategies in the classroom ‚Äì including a greater depth of understanding of concepts, broader knowledge base, improved communication and interpersonal/social skills, enhanced leadership skills, increased creativity, and improved writing skills. Another definition of project-based learning includes a type of instruction, where students work together to solve real-world problems in their schools and communities. Successful problem-solving often requires students to draw on lessons from several disciplines and apply them in a very practical way. The promise of seeing a very real impact becomes the motivation for learning. In Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?, Hye-Jung & Cheolil (2012) describe \\"social loafing\\" as a negative aspect of collaborative learning. Social loafing may include insufficient performances by some team members as well as a lowering of expected standards of performance by the group as a whole to maintain congeniality amongst members. These authors said that because teachers tend to grade the finished product only, the social dynamics of the assignment may escape the teacher's notice. Hye-Jung Lee1, h., & Cheolil Lim1, c. (2012). Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?. Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 15(4), 214-224. Structure Project- based learning emphasizes learning activities that are long-term, interdisciplinary and student-centered. Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom activities, students often must organize their own work and manage their own time in a project-based class. Project-based instruction differs from traditional inquiry by its emphasis on students' collaborative or individual artifact construction to represent what is being learned. Project- based learning also gives students the opportunity to explore problems and challenges that have real-world applications, increasing the possibility of long-term retention of skills and concepts. Elements The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world problems capture students' interest and provoke serious thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context. The teacher plays the role of facilitator, working with students to frame worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both knowledge development and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience. Typical projects present a problem to solve (What is the best way to reduce the pollution in the schoolyard pond?) or a phenomenon to investigate (What causes rain?). PBL replaces other traditional models of instruction such as lecture, textbook- workbook driven activities and inquiry as the preferred delivery method for key topics in the curriculum. It is an instructional framework that allows teachers to facilitate and assess deeper understanding rather than stand and deliver factual information. PBL intentionally develops students' problem solving and creative making of products to communicate deeper understanding of key concepts and mastery of 21st Century essential learning skills such as critical thinking. Students become active digital researchers and assessors of their own learning when teachers guide student learning so that students learn from the project making processes. In this context, PBLs are units of self- directed learning from students' doing or making throughout the unit. PBL is not just \\"an activity\\" (project) that is stuck on the end of a lesson or unit. Comprehensive project-based learning: *is organized around an open-ended driving question or challenge. *creates a need to know essential content and skills. *requires inquiry to learn and/or create something new. *requires critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication, often known as 21st century skills. *allows some degree of student voice and choice. *incorporates feedback and revision. *results in a publicly presented product or performance.http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational_leadership/sept10/vol68/num01/Seven_Essentials_for_Project- Based_Learning.aspx Examples Project-based learning in secondary school Euroinstitut Although projects are the primary vehicle for instruction in project-based learning, there are no commonly shared criteria for what constitutes an acceptable project. Projects vary greatly in the depth of the questions explored, the clarity of the learning goals, the content and structure of the activity, and guidance from the teacher. The role of projects in the overall curriculum is also open to interpretation. Projects can guide the entire curriculum (more common in charter or other alternative schools) or simply consist of a few hands-on activities. They might be multidisciplinary (more likely in elementary schools) or single-subject (commonly science and math). Some projects involve the whole class, while others are done in small groups or individually. For example, Perrault and Albert report the results of a PBL assignment in a college setting surrounding creating a communication campaign for the campus' sustainability office, finding that after project completion in small groups that the students had significantly more positive attitudes toward sustainability than prior to working on the project. When PBL is used with 21st century tools/skills, students are expected to use technology in meaningful ways to help them investigate, collaborate, analyze, synthesize and present their learning. The term IPBL (Interdisciplinary PBL) has also been used to reflect a pedagogy where an emphasis on technology and/or an interdisciplinary approach has been included. An example of a school that utilizes a project-based learning curriculum is Think Global School. In each country Think Global School visits, students select an interdisciplinary, project-based learning module designed to help them answer key questions about the world around them. These projects combine elements of global studies, the sciences, and literature, among other courses. Projects from past years have included recreating Homer's The Odyssey by sailing across Greece and exploring the locations and concepts central to the epic poem, and while in Kerala, India, students participated in a project-based learning module centered around blending their learning and travels into a mock business venture. The interdisciplinary project was designed to enable students to engage in the key areas of problem solving, decision making and communication ‚Äî all framed by the demanding parameters of a \\"Shark Tank\\", or \\"Dragon's Den\\" style competition. Another example of applied PBL is Muscatine High School, located in Muscatine, Iowa. The school started the G2 (Global Generation Exponential Learning) which consists of middle and high school \\"Schools within Schools\\" that deliver the four core subject areas. At the high school level, activities may include making water purification systems, investigating service learning, or creating new bus routes. At the middle school level, activities may include researching trash statistics, documenting local history through interviews, or writing essays about a community scavenger hunt. Classes are designed to help diverse students become college and career ready after high school. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding to start holistic PBL schools across the United States. Notable funded organizations include: * EdVisions Schools * Envision Schools * New Tech Network * Raisbeck Aviation High SchoolAviation High students land in their new school, Seattle Times, October 16, 2013. Retrieved 2013-10-29 Another example is Manor New Technology High School, a public high school that since opening in 2007 is a 100 percent project-based instruction school. Students average 60 projects a year across subjects. It is reported that 98 percent of seniors graduate, 100 percent of the graduates are accepted to college, and fifty-six percent of them have been the first in their family to attend college.Makes Project-Based Learning a Success?. Retrieved 2013-10-29 Outside of the United States, the European Union has also providing funding for project-based learning projects within the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007‚Äì2013. In China, PBL implementation has primarily been driven by International School offerings,. Larmer, John (2018) although public schools use PBL as a reference for Chinese Premier Ki Keqiang's mandate for schools to adopt Maker Education, in conjunction with micro-schools like Moonshot Academy and ETU, and maker education spaces such as SteamHead. Xin Hua News, referenced 2017. According to Terry Heick on his blog, Teach Thought, there are three types of project-based learning. The first is Challenge-Based Learning/Problem-Based Learning, the second is Place- Based Education, and the third is Activity-Based learning. Challenge-Based Learning is \\"an engaging multidisciplinary approach to teaching and learning that encourages students to leverage the technology they use in their daily lives to solve real-world problems through efforts in their homes, schools and communities.\\" Place-based Education \\"immerses students in local heritage, cultures, landscapes, opportunities and experiences; uses these as a foundation for the study of language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum, and emphasizes learning through participation in service projects for the local school and/or community.\\" Activity-Based Learning takes a kind of constructivist approach, the idea being students constructing their own meaning through hands-on activities, often with manipulatives and opportunities to. As a private school provider Nobel Education Network combines PBL with the International Baccalaureate as a central pillar of their strategy.Heick, Terry (August 2, 2018). \\"3 Types Of Project-Based Learning Symbolize Its Evolution\\" Roles PBL relies on learning groups. Student groups determine their projects, and in so doing, they engage student voice by encouraging students to take full responsibility for their learning. This is what makes PBL constructivist. Students work together to accomplish specific goals. When students use technology as a tool to communicate with others, they take on an active role vs. a passive role of transmitting the information by a teacher, a book, or broadcast. The student is constantly making choices on how to obtain, display, or manipulate information. Technology makes it possible for students to think actively about the choices they make and execute. Every student has the opportunity to get involved, either individually or as a group. The instructor's role in Project-Based Learning is that of a facilitator. They do not relinquish control of the classroom or student learning, but rather develop an atmosphere of shared responsibility. The instructor must structure the proposed question/issue so as to direct the student's learning toward content-based materials. The instructor must regulate student success with intermittent, transitional goals to ensure student projects remain focused and students have a deep understanding of the concepts being investigated. The students are held accountable to these goals through ongoing feedback and assessments. The ongoing assessment and feedback are essential to ensure the student stays within the scope of the driving question and the core standards the project is trying to unpack. According to Andrew Miller of the Buck Institute of Education, \\"In order to be transparent to parents and students, you need to be able to track and monitor ongoing formative assessments that show work toward that standard.\\" The instructor uses these assessments to guide the inquiry process and ensure the students have learned the required content. Once the project is finished, the instructor evaluates the finished product and the learning that it demonstrates. The student's role is to ask questions, build knowledge, and determine a real-world solution to the issue/question presented. Students must collaborate, expanding their active listening skills and requiring them to engage in intelligent, focused communication, therefore allowing them to think rationally about how to solve problems. PBL forces students to take ownership of their success. Outcomes More important than learning science, students need to learn to work in a community, thereby taking on social responsibilities. The most significant contributions of PBL have been in schools languishing in poverty stricken areas; when students take responsibility, or ownership, for their learning, their self-esteem soars. It also helps to create better work habits and attitudes toward learning. In standardized tests, languishing schools have been able to raise their testing grades a full level by implementing PBL. Although students do work in groups, they also become more independent because they are receiving little instruction from the teacher. With Project-Based Learning students also learn skills that are essential in higher education. The students learn more than just finding answers, PBL allows them to expand their minds and think beyond what they normally would. Students have to find answers to questions and combine them using critically thinking skills to come up with answers. PBL is significant to the study of (mis-)conceptions; local concepts and childhood intuitions that are hard to replace with conventional classroom lessons. In PBL, project science is the community culture; the student groups themselves resolve their understandings of phenomena with their own knowledge building. Technology allows them to search in more useful ways, along with getting more rapid results. Blumenfeld & Krajcik (2006) cite studies that show students in project-based learning classrooms get higher scores than students in traditional classroom.Sawyer, R. K. (2006) The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences. New York: Cambridge University Press. Opponents of Project Based Learning warn against negative outcomes primarily in projects that become unfocused and tangential arguing that underdeveloped lessons can result in the wasting of precious class time. No one teaching method has been proven more effective than another. Opponents suggest that narratives and presentation of anecdotal evidence included in lecture-style instruction can convey the same knowledge in less class time. Given that disadvantaged students generally have fewer opportunities to learn academic content outside of school, wasted class time due to an unfocused lesson presents a particular problem. Instructors can be deluded into thinking that as long as a student is engaged and doing, they are learning. Ultimately it is cognitive activity that determines the success of a lesson. If the project does not remain on task and content driven the student will not be successful in learning the material. The lesson will be ineffective. A source of difficulty for teachers includes, \\"Keeping these complex projects on track while attending to students' individual learning needs requires artful teaching, as well as industrial-strength project management.\\" Like any approach, Project Based Learning is only beneficial when applied successfully. Problem-based learning is a similar pedagogic approach, however, problem-based approaches structure students' activities more by asking them to solve specific (open-ended) problems rather than relying on students to come up with their own problems in the course of completing a project. Another seemingly similar approach is quest-based learning; unlike project-based learning, in questing, the project is determined specifically on what students find compelling (with guidance as needed), instead of the teacher being primarily responsible for forming the essential question and task. A meta-analysis conducted by Purdue University found that when implemented well, PBL can increase long-term retention of material and replicable skill, as well as improve teachers' and students' attitudes towards learning. Overcoming obstacles and criticisms A frequent criticism of PBL is that when students work in groups some will \\"slack off\\" or sit back and let the others do all the work. Anne Shaw recommends that teachers always build into the structure of the PBL curriculum an organizational strategy known as Jigsaw and Expert Groups. This structure forces students to be self-directed, independent and to work interdependently. This means that the class is assigned (preferably randomly, by lottery) to Expert Groups. Each of the Expert Groups is then assigned to deeply study one particular facet of the overall project. For example, a class studying about environmental issues in their community may be divided into the following Expert Groups: # Air # Land # Water # Human impact on the environment Each Expert Group is tasked with studying the materials for their group, taking notes, then preparing to teach what they learned to the rest of the students in the class. To do so, the class will \\"jigsaw\\", thus creating Jigsaw Groups. The Jigsaw Groups in the above example would each be composed of one representative from each of the Expert Groups, so each Jigsaw Group would include: # One expert on Air # One expert on Land # One expert on Water # One expert on \\"Human impact on the environment\\" Each of these experts would then take turns teaching the others in the group. Total interdependence is assured. No one can \\"slack off\\" because each student is the only person in the group with that \\"piece\\" of the information. Another benefit is that the students must have learned the concepts, skills and information well enough to be able to teach it and must be able to assess (not grade) their own learning and the learning of their peers. This forces a much deeper learning experience. Anne Shaw recommends that when students are teaching each other they also participate collaboratively in creating a concept map as they teach each other. This adds a significant dimension to the thinking and the learning. The students may build upon this map each time they Jigsaw. If a project is scheduled to last over the time period of six weeks the students may meet in their Expert Groups twice a week, and then Jigsaw twice a week, building upon their learning and exploration of the topics over time. Once all the experts have taught each other, the Jigsaw Group then designs and creates a product to demonstrate what they now know about all four aspects of the PBL unit ‚Äì air, land, water, human's impact. Performance-based products may include a wide range of possibilities such as dioramas, skits, plays, debates, student-produced documentaries, web sites, Glogsters, VoiceThreads, games (digital or not), presentations to members of the community (such as the City Council or a community organization), student-produced radio or television program, a student-organized conference, a fair, a film festival. Students are assessed in two ways: # Individual assessments for each student ‚Äì may include research notes, teaching prep notes and teacher observation. Other assessments may include those assigned by the teacher, for example, each student in the class must write an individual research paper for a topic of their choice from within the theme of the overall PBL. # Group assessments ‚Äì each Jigsaw group creates and presents their product, preferably to an audience other than the teacher or their class.21st Century Schools. Retrieved 2016-03-15 Criticism One concern is that PBL may be inappropriate in mathematics, the reason being that mathematics is primarily skill-based at the elementary level. Transforming the curriculum into an over-reaching project or series of projects does not allow for necessary practice of particular mathematical skills. For instance, factoring quadratic expressions in elementary algebra requires extensive repetition . On the other hand, a teacher could integrate a PBL approach into the standard curriculum, helping the students see some broader contexts where abstract quadratic equations may apply. For example, Newton's law implies that tossed objects follow a parabolic path, and the roots of the corresponding equation correspond to the starting and ending locations of the object. Another criticism of PBL is that measures that are stated as reasons for its success are not measurable using standard measurement tools, and rely on subjective rubrics for assessing results. In PBL there is also a certain tendency for the creation of the final product of the project to become the driving force in classroom activities. When this happens, the project can lose its content focus and be ineffective in helping students learn certain concepts and skills. For example, academic projects that culminate in an artistic display or exhibit may place more emphasis on the artistic processes involved in creating the display than on the academic content that the project is meant to help students learn.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 9, 1992. In the episode, Bart receives a microphone that transmits sound to nearby AM radios. To play a prank on the citizens of Springfield, he lowers a radio down a well and uses the microphone to trick the town into thinking a little boy is trapped there. The prank succeeds, but Bart remembers labelling the radio with his name, tries to retrieve it, and becomes trapped himself. Angry at being duped by Bart, the townspeople refuse to rescue him. The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Carlos Baeza. Musician Sting guest starred in the episode as himself, though the producers originally approached Bruce Springsteen to appear. The episode features cultural references to charity singles such as \\"We Are the World\\". Since airing, \\"Radio Bart\\" has received a positive critical reception from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.1 and was the highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. It was nominated for an Emmy Award but lost to A Claymation Easter. Plot Homer sees a television commercial for the Superstar Celebrity Microphone -- which can broadcast anyone's voice over AM radio -- and impulsively buys one for Bart's birthday. At his party, Bart is crestfallen when he receives gifts such as a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first Bart dislikes the microphone, but he later uses it to play practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's sons, Rod and Todd, into believing that God is talking to them, eavesdropping on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading. Bart plays a prank by lowering a radio down a well and using the microphone to broadcast his voice, tricking the townspeople into thinking an orphan named Timmy O'Toole has fallen down the well. Although they are unable to rescue Timmy, since the well is too small to accommodate an adult, the entire town offers its love and moral support. Krusty persuades Sting to join other celebrities in recording a charity single, \\"We're Sending Our Love Down the Well\\". Lisa catches Bart imitating Timmy's voice and reminds him that the townspeople will be angry at him for being duped, while correctly assuming that he put a \\"Property of Bart Simpson\\" label on the radio. For fear of reprisal, Bart tries to retrieve the radio after nightfall but falls to the bottom when policemen Eddie and Lou untie the rope Bart uses to lower himself down the well. When the townspeople find Bart trapped there, he admits Timmy does not exist. Angry at being tricked, the townspeople refuse to rescue him, despite efforts by Homer and Marge to mobilize a rescue operation. Homer has finally had enough and decides to dig a tunnel and rescue Bart himself. Groundskeeper Willie helps Homer dig and soon several others join the excavation. Bart is finally rescued with help from Sting and other residents. The next day, Willie posts a warning sign near the well to prevent future accidents. Production \\"Radio Bart\\" was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening came up with the idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; \\"[Groening] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story.\\" Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, \\"It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find.\\" Bruce Springsteen declined an offer to feature in the episode. The producers approached singer Bruce Springsteen to appear in the episode because he had participated to the charity song \\"We Are the World\\", on which \\"We're Sending Our Love Down the Well\\" is based. Springsteen declined so the producers offered the role to British musician Sting instead. Executive producer Al Jean said Sting is one of his favorite guest stars that have appeared on the show and he \\"couldn't have been better. He was really funny.\\" The Simpsons director David Silverman said Sting's appearance in the episode worked for his persona because he has campaigned for political and social causes in real life. Sting was staying in New York City at the time of the episode's recording so Vitti flew there to record the lines with him. The television commercial for the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that Homer watches, was inspired by a popular Ronco Mr. Microphone commercial from the late 1970s, in which a boy becomes popular and \\"scores with the girls\\" by using his microphone to be on the radio. Both commercials feature a boy riding by in a car full of friends saying, \\"Hey, good-looking, we'll be back to pick you up later\\", a line the staff thought was \\"hilarious\\". In the Superstar Celebrity Microphone commercial, the boy sings the 1975 song \\"Convoy\\" by C. W. McCall into the microphone. The producers originally wanted him to sing \\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\\" by Gordon Lightfoot, a song about the sinking of the bulk carrier on Lake Superior. However, according to Vitti, Lightfoot's licensing arrangement would have required the producers to get permission from the families of the twenty-nine crewmen who died on the ship, so \\"Convoy\\" was used instead. Homer also sings the song on the microphone to convince Bart to like the present. Cultural references Chuck E. Cheese's. The plotline is similar to an incident involving Jessica McClure, a young girl who fell into a well and received support from citizens and celebrities. At the beginning of the episode, Homer watches the show Soul Train and its host Don Cornelius on television. One citizen suggests using chocolate attached to a fish-hook to save Timmy, a reference to the character Quint from the 1975 film Jaws. The episode also parodies charity records. The song \\"We're Sending Our Love Down the Well\\" is a spoof of \\"We Are the World\\", and the idea of celebrities singing it is based on USA for Africa, the name under which forty-five famous artists recorded \\"We Are the World\\". The background music heard when Bart sneaks down the well is based on \\"Axel F\\" from the film Beverly Hills Cop, and would later become a recurring track throughout the show. The Wall E. Weasel's pizza restaurant at which Bart celebrates his birthday is a parody of the family pizza restaurant franchise Chuck E. Cheese's.. Funky-See, Funky-Do with their hit \\"I Do Believe We're Naked\\" resembles the music style of Milli Vanilli. While down in the tunnel they dug, Apu tells the crew that a nearby canary has died. Canaries were historically used by miners to detect the release of poisonous gases. Sting's band, The Police had a song called \\"Canary in a Coal Mine\\" which was on their third studio album Zenyatta Mondatta.https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0701200/trivia Reception Sting was praised for his performance in the episode. In its original American broadcast, \\"Radio Bart\\" finished 31st in the ratings for the week of Jan. 6‚Äì12, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.1, equivalent to approximately 13 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. The episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, but lost to Will Vinton's A Claymation Easter on CBS. \\"Radio Bart\\" was submitted for consideration because it was the staff's favorite episode of the season. Executive producer Al Jean said they thought this episode or an episode of The Ren & Stimpy Show would win and they were \\"absolutely floored\\" when neither did. The Simpsons director David Silverman said he thinks The Simpsons and Ren & Stimpy split the vote, allowing A Claymation Easter to win the Emmy. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It was named the second-best episode of The Simpsons by Kirk Baird of the Las Vegas Sun and the third best episode by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: \\"Despite the potential for some heavy-handed moralizing, 'Radio Bart' provides a terrific show. From Bart's crappy birthday to his pranks to the public reaction to Timmy's trapping, the humor flies fast and furious in this excellent episode. It's one of the better ones.\\" The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of ten best episodes of The Simpsons. DVD Times's Chris Kaye said \\"Radio Bart\\" is \\"another demonstration of the series' knack for cultural references, parodying the Billy Wilder movie Ace in the Hole\\". Entertainment Weekly ranked \\"Radio Bart\\" as the 20th best episode of The Simpsons and commented that \\"it's a media parody so sharp, we're still stinging a bit.\\" When The Simpsons began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former Simpsons writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service.

It was originally established as a military vicariate, with the Archbishop of New York also serving as the military vicar. It was reorganized as an archdiocese, with its own archbishop and its see relocated to the District of Columbia by Pope John Paul II in 1986. The current diocesan bishop is Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio. He is assisted by several auxiliary bishops. Together, they oversee Catholic priests serving as chaplains throughout the world. Each chaplain remains incardinated into the diocese or religious institute for which he was ordained. The Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA is a personal jurisdiction, meaning that it has no defined territory and that its jurisdiction extends to those whom it serves throughout the world. It has jurisdiction wherever American men and women in uniform serve. The jurisdiction of the Archdiocese extends to all United States government property in the United States and abroad, including U.S. military installations, embassies, consulates and other diplomatic missions. History Chaplain Joseph T. O'Callahan ministers to an injured man aboard , 1945. Prior to the creation of the Military Ordinariate and then the Archdiocese for the Military Services, the armed forces of the United States was served by an informal corps of volunteer priests. Beginning in 1917, the spiritual care of those in military service fell to the Military Vicariate, the equivalent of a personal vicariate apostolic, that is, a particular church the membership of which is defined by some personal quality (as in this case being a member or a dependent of a member of the armed services) that is headed by a legate of the pope. Originally, the ordinariate was headed by then-Bishop Patrick Hayes, an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York who served double duty as papal military vicar for the United States beginning on November 24, 1917. Hayes was chosen because New York was the primary port of embarkation for U.S. troops leaving for Europe and therefore a convenient contact point for Catholic chaplains serving with them. When Cardinal John Farley, Archbishop of New York, died, Hayes was appointed as his successor and kept the additional title and duty of military vicar. In November 1939, the Holy See established the Military Vicariate of the United States of America. The post remained an additional duty of the archbishop of New York from Hayes' time until Cardinal Terence Cooke began plans to separate it as its own jurisdiction in the early 1980s, plans he was unable to carry out before his death in 1983. Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor‚Äîa retired Navy chaplain with the rank of Rear Admiral, having served as chief of Navy chaplains (the military's title for its own senior chaplain officer) subsequently served as an auxiliary bishop for the Military Vicariate. He succeeded Cardinal Cooke as Archbishop of New York and Apostolic Administrator of the Military Vicariate. He oversaw the completion of the transition. On July 21, 1986, Pope John Paul II reconstituted the military vicariate as the present Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA,Archdiocese for the Military Services of the United States.

The verse speaks about how nothing and nobody is regarded to be comparable to Allah. This is one of the best-known verses of the Quran and is widely memorised and displayed in the Islamic world. It is often recited to ward off evil spirits. Text and meaning Verse Al-Kursi consists of ten permanent sentences.Tafsƒ´r ibn Kathƒ´r, al-Baqarah, tafsir verse 255 (Ayatul Kursi) =Text and transliteration= *Hafs from Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud 255 =Meaning= 255 Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists. Neither slumber, nor sleep overtake Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter . And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.  255 ‚Äì there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.  255 Allah! there is no God but He the living the Self-subsisting Eternal. No slumber can seize him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to his creatures as) before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of his knowledge except as He willeth. His throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. For He is the Most High the Supreme (in glory).  255 Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave? He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them, while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will. His Throne includeth the heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime, the Tremendous.  Ayat al-Kursi is regarded as one of the most powerful ayahs in the Quran because when it is recited, the greatness of God is believed to be confirmed. The person who recites this ayah morning and evening will be under protection of Allah from the evil of the jinns; this is also known as the daily adkhar. It is used in exorcism, to cure and protect from jinns. ne O *one who recites Ayatul Kursi regularly is given by Allah wisdom to his heart, faith, sincerity, reliance and honour. One who recites it he'd be safe from instigations of Satan and forgetfulness. {{cite appurl=https://divine- pearl.com/Ayatul kursi Symmetry of Verses Ayat al-Kursi displays an internal symmetry comprising concentric looping verses surrounding a pivotal chiasm 'x' of the type A B C D X D' C' B' A'.

In 1869, he was part of a survey party sent to the Red River Colony. On the orders of survey party leader, John Stoughton Dennis, he organized a group of volunteers to try to put down an uprising by Louis Riel. When 50 of his volunteers were captured and imprisoned, he left the colony and went to Portage la Prairie. He met some people who had escaped there and led an attempt to free the remaining captives. They were taken captive by Riel's M√©tis. He was later released and returned to Ontario. He operated a sawmill near Lakefield, Ontario, where he became a municipal councillor and then reeve. When his business failed in 1877, he settled in the Shell River valley of Manitoba. He became the first warden of Russell County and chairman of the judicial board for the western district in 1881. In 1885, he led a group of militia known as Boulton's Scouts to help put down the North-West Rebellion. He was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1889. He died in Russell, Manitoba in 1899.

He served as a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1987, and again from 1990 to 1995. Background Hayes was born in Maidstone Township, Ontario. He was the 13th child in a family of 18 children. He did not complete high school, instead he got a job at Ford Motors. Hayes reflected on his early life choices. He said, \\"When I was a teenager it was one of those cases where if you wanted a new pair of pants, or shoes, you had to go to work for them.\\" By the time he was 25 he was plant health and safety representative for the Canadian Auto Workers. He lived in Essex County, Ontario where he and his wife Rose Claire raised five children. Provincial politics Hayes was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Jack Morris by about 1,300 votes in Essex North. He served as the NDP critic for Transportation and Communications, Tourism and Recreation, and Agriculture in the parliament that followed. The Liberals won a landslide majority in the 1987 provincial election, and Hayes his seat lost to Liberal MPP Jim McGuigan, by 1,113 votes in the redistributed riding of Essex‚ÄîKent. He ran against McGuigan again in the 1990 election, this time defeating him by 5,890 votes amid a provincial victory for the NDP under Bob Rae. He served as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Agriculture and Food from 1990 to 1993, and to the Minister of Municipal Affairs from 1993 to 1995. In 1994, Hayes was one of twelve NDP members to vote against Bill 167, a bill extending financial benefits to same-sex partners. Premier Bob Rae allowed a free vote on the bill which allowed members of his party to vote with their conscience. By the 2003 campaign, he had changed his mind on this issue. The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election, and Hayes finished third, 2,293 votes behind the winning candidate, Liberal Pat Hoy. He sought a return to the legislature in the 2003 provincial election, but, although he was generally seen as a strong candidate, he lost to Liberal incumbent Bruce Crozier by about 8,000 votes in the riding of Essex. Municipal politics Hayes was mayor of Lakeshore, Ontario from 1997 to 2003, and was generally regarded as a popular figure within that community. He managed the campaign of Taras Natyshak, a family friend and NDP candidate in Essex in the 2006 and 2008 federal elections. Later life Hayes died in 2011 after a long battle with lung cancer.

His most notable aerodynamic work being partly responsible for the engineering body development of the E-Type Jaguar and early style guidelines for Jaguar XJS. He spent the last twenty years of his life working at Jaguar Cars and was one of the first engineers to apply principles of aircraft streamline aero function to cars. Early life and education Sayer was born in Cromer, Norfolk. He was educated at Great Yarmouth Grammar School (where his father taught Maths and Art). At age 17 he won the prestigious Empire Scholarship and attended at Loughborough College (later Loughborough University) in its Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, earning first class honours. Early career He worked for the Bristol Aeroplane Company during the Second World War, which exempted him from conscription by way of reserved occupation protection. Sayer traveled to Iraq in 1948 to work at Baghdad University where he was to establish the Faculty of Engineering, which on arrival he found not to be a realistic venture. While in Iraq he reportedly met a German professor who helped him recognise the mathematical relationship to curve shapes and identity. He worked instead maintaining the fleet of government vehicles. He returned to the UK in late 1950. Career at Jaguar 1953 Jaguar C-Type 1956 Jaguar D-Type Jaguar E-Type series 1 coup√© Sayer applied for an engineering position at Jaguar. He was interviewed by William Heynes Chief Engineer (1935) and Technical Director (1946). Heynes who had a mathematics honours degree recognised Sayers' aerodynamic mathematical approach and also importantly Heynes had been involved during wartime with aircraft production and was familiar with aircraft fuselage alloy construction. Sayer started work at Jaguar Cars Engineering drawing office in early 1951. He described himself as an industrial designer and artist. He loathed the term 'stylist', saying he was not a hairdresser. His aerodynamic work under the guidance of Heynes at Jaguar concentrated on racing car air flow design. He assisted in the aero design of the competition cars during the 1950s * Jaguar C-Type (also called XK120-C, due to its being based on the Jaguar XK120) * Jaguar D-Type * Jaguar E-Type (early style proposals) * Jaguar XJ13 racing prototype His prime concern was that a car body 'worked' both aerodynamically and visually. Some of his particular contributions were the introduction of slide rule and seven- figure log tables to work out formulae he invented for drawing curves, work which is now undertaken by complex Computer Aided Design software. Sayer's first aero contribution for a sports racing Jaguar was successful and the C-Type won Le Mans in 1951 and 1953. (Sayers 1952 long tail with lower frontal nose was not successful) The C Type overall design was the work of William Heynes with body structure, frame, suspension, mechanical, and engine design was the responsibility of William Heynes, R J (Bob) Knight T C Jones. The C-Type has been lauded for its beauty and is still considered one of the world's most desirable car models. To surpass the C-Type, Sayer assisted with the development of the D-Type Jaguar as aerodynamist. The new to racing body alloy tub monocoque structure, was designed by Heynes and the engineering team of Knight Jones Emmerson Bailey who designed and developed the full car which was one of the most successful racing cars of all time, winning Le Mans in 1955, 1956 and 1957. On the Mulsanne Straight, D-Type could achieve a speed of . Heynes and the engineering team later commenced design and development in 1957 for the Jaguar E-Type which was launched to world acclaim in Geneva March 1961, the icon of 1960s motoring. Even today, many of the design elements associated with the E-Type Jaguar can be found on the company's cars. The long bonnet, haunches over the rear wheels and the stance are all features incorporated into Jaguar's XK8 coupe designed by the late design director Geoff Lawson, which have continued on in the current Jaguar line-up by his successor Ian Callum. In 1965, Sayer developed the body aero style for Jaguar XJ13, a mid-engined Jaguar sports racing car that was intended for competition at Le Mans. Cost constraints and a rule change at Le Mans meant the XJ-13 was never driven in international competition, but it exemplified all of the classical Sayer sophistication in aerodynamics as his earlier work. In 1971 the XJ 13 prototype was brought out of storage to help promote the new V12 E-Type when it was largely written off in a major crash. The car was rebuilt in 1972/73 albeit with changes from the original ‚Äî losing some of the classic lines in the process. In 1967 following his work on XJ13 Sayer commenced early style proposals William Heynes for an E Type replacement, later (XJ27) with modifications to evolve as the V 12-cylinder Jaguar XJS in 1975. The XJS never perhaps achieved the same iconic status as the E-Type, but it was acclaimed for its Heynes / Hassan / Knight designed V12 performance and comfort, luxury and grandeur as a grand tourer. The XJS remained in production for 21 years (1975-1996). Personal life and death Sayer married Pat Morgan in 1947. They had three children: daughter Kate (born 1948), son John (born 1953) and daughter Mary (born 1956). He was a watercolourist and musician, playing piano, guitar and other instruments. He suffered a fatal heart attack outside Parkside Garage, next to the Regent Hotel in Leamington Spa, one month before his 54th birthday. Honours and awards A memorial plaque to him was unveiled at Loughborough University on 21 May 2005. On 24 May 2008 a plaque was unveiled at his birthplace on Cromer, and another at Great Yarmouth Grammar school. A blue plaque dedicated to him was unveiled on 28 April 2010 at Portland Place (his last address) in Leamington Spa.

Bernard Shaw. It was published in Shaw's 1901 collection Three Plays for Puritans (together with Caesar and Cleopatra and The Devil's Disciple). The first American production of the play starred Ellen Terry in 1907. The play explores the relationship between the law, justice, revenge and forgiveness. Characters *Lady Cicely Waynflete *Sir Howard Hallam *Captain Brassbound *Rankin *Drinkwater *Redbrook *Johnson *Marzo *Sidi El Assif *The Cadi *Osman *Hassan *Captain Hamlin Kearney, U.S.N. *American Bluejacket Plot ACT I, Mogador, Morocco. Sir Howard Hallam, a judge, and his sister-in-law, Lady Cicely Waynflete, a well- known explorer, are at the home of Rankin, a Presbyterian minister. Rankin knows Sir Howard as the brother of an old friend, Miles Hallam, who moved to Brazil after marrying a local woman. Sir Howard tells Rankin that his brother's property was illicitly seized after his death by his widow's family, but Sir Howard has now recovered it. Lady Cicely decides to explore Morocco with Sir Howard. They are advised to take an armed escort. This can be organised by Captain Brassbound, a smuggler who owns a ship called Thanksgiving. When Brassbound arrives, he warns Sir Howard that in the mountain-country justice is ruled by codes of honour, not law courts. ACT II, A Moorish castle occupied by Brassbound. Marzo, an Italian member of Brassbound's crew, has been wounded in a feud. Lady Cicely is tending to him, initially to Brassbound's irritation, but she wins him over. Sir Howard complains that Brassbound is behaving more like a jailer than a host; Brassbound says that Sir Howard is his prisoner. Brassbound explains that he is the son of Sir Howard's deceased brother, Miles. He blames Sir Howard for the death of his mother and for tricking him out of his inheritance by legal technicalities. He intends to hand over Sir Howard to a fanatical Islamist Sheik. He tells Sir Howard that he presides over an unfair justice system that punishes the poor and weak. Now that Sir Howard is powerless he will receive the justice of revenge. Lady Cicely intercedes and argues with Brassbound that his own code of honour is at least as brutal as the legal system he condemns. Brassbound wavers, and eventually agrees to give up revenge. When the Sheik arrives he offers to buy back Sir Howard, but the Shek will only accept one price - Lady Cicely. Cicely agrees, but at this point the local ruler appears, having learned of the transaction. He frees Sir Howard and arrests Brassbound. ACT III, Rankin's house. Commander Kearney is to preside over a court of inquiry into Brassbound's actions. Sir Howard says he cannot interfere, but Lady Cicely persuades him to let her tell the court all that happened on the trip. She uses all her powers of persuasion to convince Commander Kearney that Brassbound is innocent of any crime. Kearney agrees to release Brassbound. The liberated Brassbound declares his devotion to Lady Cicely, and says he wishes to marry her. Lady Cicely is powerfully drawn to Brassbound, and fears that she may succumb to his charisma. As she is about to agree, a gunshot is heard. It is the signal from Brassbound's crew that his ship is ready to depart. He leaves immediately, leaving Lady Cicely to say \\"What an escape!\\" Preface and notes  Shaw explained that the topic of the play was the relationship between law and justice. He commented that \\"one of the evils of the pretence that our institutions represent abstract principles of justice, instead of being mere social scaffolding, is that persons of a certain temperament take the pretence seriously; and when the law is on the side of injustice, will not accept the situation, and are driven mad by their vain struggle against it\\".Violet M. Broad & C. Lewis Broad, Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw, A. & C. Black, London, 1929, p.37. Shaw added that his information about Morocco came from Cunninghame Graham's book, Mogreb-el-Acksa (Morocco the Most Holy), \\"without which Captain Brassbound's Conversion would never have been written\\". The story of the legal dispute over the estate was derived from information provided about a similar case given to him by a Frederick Jackson, of Hindhead. In performance The play was first performed at the Stage Society on 16 December 1900, at the Strand Theatre. A production in Manchester at the Queen's Theatre followed on 12 May 1902. The first London production was at the Royal Court, 20 March 1906 with Ellen Terry as Cicely Waynflete and Frederick Kerr as Brassbound.Violet M. Broad & C.

It is a registered charity. Overview Viva! is an animal rights' campaigning organisation, working on issues such as factory farming and slaughter and is based in Bristol, with a branch office in Poland. Campaigns include End Factory Farming, Eat Green, Foie-Gras free Britain, Exotic Meat, Ban the Farrowing Crate, Dark Side of Dairy and youth campaigns including The Big Coverup. Campaigns in 2018 included an investigation into Hogwood Pig Farm in Warwickshire, and Scary Dairy's \\"Trash\\" campaign, highlighting the dairy industry's forgotten victims: male calves. Events Following on from its success with the former biannual national \\"Incredible Vegan Roadshow\\" in London, Viva! now organises six annual festivals across the UK designed to help people become vegetarian or vegan. These are: Bristol Viva! Vegan Festival, Cardiff Viva! Vegan Festival, Swansea Viva! Vegan Festival, Stockport Viva! Vegan Festival, Birmingham Viva! Vegan Festival and Coventry Viva! Vegan Festival. Viva! also do a number of outreach events each year to raise awareness and support of its current campaigns. Publications and resources In addition to producing leaflets, factsheets, guides, posters, wallcharts, health and nutrition reports, websites, podcasts, blogs and other resources, the group publishes a triannual journal entitled Viva! LIFE, which includes recent campaign updates, as well as vegan recipes, vegan lifestyle articles, information about new vegan products and businesses, and vegan health and nutrition advice. It also published a Viva! Cookbook in 2014. Celebrity endorsement Viva! enjoys the patronage of numerous well-known entertainers, including Martin Shaw, Heather Mills, Michael Mansfield QC, Jerome Flynn, Hayley Mills and Paul McCartney. In the press In 2009, Viva! criticised supermarket chain Tesco for turning 5,000 tonnes of meat that had passed its sell-by date into electricity by burning it. Viva! argued the meat industry was cruel and wasteful, and converting out-of-date meat into heat with CO2 as byproduct was not environmentally sustainable, but Tesco defended its decision. In 2012, Viva! stated that it favoured the development of cultured meat. \\"Certainly, with over 950 million land animals slaughtered in the UK each year, and the vast majority of them factory farmed in awful conditions, anything that saves animals from suffering is to be welcomed,\\" former Viva! spokesman and campaign manager Justin Kerswell said, adding that individuals should make up their own mind on whether or not they would consume it themselves, because 'vegetarianism and veganism aren't religions'.

Having released five studio albums, on 28 March 2007, Fogarty announced the end of the project on Blabbermouth, the Death To Music website and also on Myspace but revived it in 2012. Band history The purpose of this one-man project was to try and forge a unique musical sound. After the release of the first album, Battle Furies on a short-lived Neat Records subsidiary called Eldethorn, Fogarty gave his entire music collection away to an Oxfam charity shop so that he would be free of influences creating his next work. Starscape was received well by the extreme music press, but label folded and the project was put on hiatus. During the missing years, Ewigkeit concentrated on his other black metal project The Meads of Asphodel and his collaboration with Jimmy Cauty on the multi-media project Blacksmoke. In 2003 Land of Fog, was eventually released on Metal Age Productions. Fogarty himself regarded this as the first Ewigkeit album, and it gained him enough attention to get his project signed to Earache Records, on which Radio Ixtlan was released in 2004, to considerable acclaim. Released in 2005, Conspiritus (mixed by John Fryer), a conceptual album examining conspiracy theories, has been hailed by many as \\"marking a maturation of Ewigkeit's eclectic sound.\\" Also in 2005, a music video was made in collaboration with film-maker Anthony Gates for the track \\"Its Not Reality\\". In 2006, Ewigkeit made a live video recording entitled Ewigkeit - Live From A Bunker, which displayed the project in a live setting acting as a free \\"online\\" gig - the 25 minute set (filmed in a Nuclear Bunker in the vicinity of Brighton, England) was uploaded to Google video. Also recorded was a free download MP3 EP, Return to the Land of Fog.Ewigkeit at Earache.com In December 2006, Fogerty burned all his recording contracts. All previous Ewigkeit material was then made available at Deathtomusic.com. In January 2007, Death to Music Productions gave away a remastered and superior version of Battle Furies. In March 2007, Starscape was available free, with the intention that all material will be fully released online. In March 2007, James Fogarty abandoned the Ewigkeit project, stating in the press-release, \\"... [metal] is mostly out-of-date, out-of-touch with its origins and (worst of all) conservative in the extreme...\\" An online link to Fogerty's new project, The Bombs of Enduring Freedom, was created with the debut self-titled album released in December 2007, and an EP Kalashikovs and Car Bombs, followed in 2008. During this time, he also produced the Old Forest album Tales of the Sussex Weald. In 2012 Ewigkeit was reactivated, with a black metal sound, and two more studio albums were released: Back to Beyond in August 2012, and Cosmic Man (July 2017). Etymology Ewigkeit was the name given to this music project when Fogerty found the word in the English Concise Oxford Dictionary.

It is seldom used for pancake or waffle syrup, more often it is used as an ingredient paired with pork or salmon dishes in sauces, glazes, and dressings, and as a flavoring in ice cream, beer, wine, and soft drinks. It is condensed from the sap, which has about 0.5‚Äì2% percent sugar content, depending on the species of birch, location, weather, and season. The finished syrup is 66% sugar or more to be classified as a syrup. Birch sap sugar is about 42‚Äì54% fructose and 45% glucose, with a small amount of sucrose and trace amounts of galactose. The main sugar in maple syrup is the more complex sucrose and the chemical contents of maple syrup is also different, leading to a flavor difference. The flavor of birch syrup has a distinctive and mineral-rich caramel-like taste that is not unlike molasses or balsamic condiment or some types of soy, with a hint of spiciness. Different types of birch will produce slightly different flavour profiles; some more copper, others with hints of wildflower honey. While birch syrup has the same sugar content of maple it is darker and stronger and more complex than maple. Method Birch sap Festival, Russia. Evaporation of birch sap into birch syrup Making birch syrup is more difficult than making maple syrup, requiring about 100‚Äì150 liters of sap to produce one liter of syrup (more than twice that needed for maple syrup). The tapping window for birch is generally shorter than for maple, primarily because birches live in more northerly climates. It also happens later in the year than maple tapping. The trees are tapped and their sap collected in the spring (generally mid- to late April, about two to three weeks before the leaves appear on the trees). The common belief is that while birches have a lower trunk and root pressure than maples, pipeline or tubing method of sap collection used in large maple sugaring operations is not as useful in birch sap collection. However Rocky Lake Birchworks in The Pas, Manitoba is successfully using the tubing method along with a vacuum system for collection of birch sap. The sap is reduced in the same way as maple sap, using reverse osmosis machines and evaporators in commercial production. While maple sap may be boiled down without the use of reverse osmosis, birch syrup is difficult to produce this way: the sap is more temperature sensitive than is maple sap because fructose burns at a lower temperature than sucrose, the primary sugar in maple sap. This means that boiling birch sap to produce syrup can much more easily result in a scorched taste. Production Most birch syrup is produced in Russia, Alaska and Canada from Paper Birch or Alaska Birch sap (Betula papyrifera var. humilis and neoalaskana). These trees are found primarily in interior and south central Alaska. The Kenai birch (Betula papyrifera var. kenaica), which is also used, grows most abundantly on the Kenai Peninsula, but is also found in the south central part of the state and hybridizes with humilis. The southeast Alaska variety is the Western paper birch, (Betula papyrifera var. commutata) and has a lower sugar content. One litre of syrup from these trees requires evaporation of approximately 130‚Äì150 litres of sap.\\"Haines birch syrups attract gourmet following\\" , Margaret Baumann, Alaska Journal of Commerce, May 29, 2005 Total production of birch syrup in Alaska is approximately 3,800 liters (1,000 U.S. gallons) per year, with smaller quantities made in other U.S. states and Canada (also from Paper Birch), Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Scandinavia (from other species of birch). Because of the higher sap-to-syrup ratio and difficulties in production, birch syrup is more expensive than maple syrup, up to five times the price.

He had established himself as one of the top sluggers in the game before drugs derailed his career. In 1994, Aikens was sentenced to 20 years in prison on four counts of crack cocaine distribution and one count of use of a firearm during drug trafficking. He was released on June 4, 2008, after changes in federal drug laws, and is sometimes cited as an example of the results of mandatory minimum sentencing in drug-related crimes. Early years Aikens grew up in poverty in the Bruce Hill community of Seneca, South Carolina. He was a standout athlete in baseball, football and basketball at Seneca High School, and attended historically black South Carolina State University on a baseball and football scholarship. When S.C. State dropped baseball after Aikens' freshman year, Willie McNeil, Aikens' high school baseball coach, helped him catch on with a semi-pro summer baseball league in Baltimore, Maryland. While playing in Baltimore, he caught the eye of California Angels scout Walter Youse and was selected by the Angels with the number two overall pick in the January MLB draft. MLB careerCalifornia Angels= Aikens soon emerged as one of the top sluggers in California's farm system, slugging a league leading thirty home runs and driving in 117 runs for the El Paso Diablos in . He debuted with the Angels in ; however, after batting an unimpressive .230 with no home runs mostly as a pinch hitter and designated hitter, he was returned to the minors. He received a second call to the majors that September, but fared even worse, collecting just four hits in 30 at-bats. Aikens returned to his slugging ways in , batting .326 with 29 home runs and 110 runs batted in for the Pacific Coast League's Salt Lake City Gulls. He returned to the majors in , assuming DH duties and replacing Rod Carew at first base in June and July while the future Hall Of Famer was out with a thumb injury. He batted .280 with 21 home runs and 81 RBIs his rookie season. That winter, he and Rance Mulliniks were traded to the Kansas City Royals for Al Cowens, Todd Cruz and a player to be named later. =Kansas City Royals= Aikens inherited the first base job upon his arrival in Kansas City despite not being a very good fielder (he committed a league-leading 12 errors in ). Recovering from knee surgery, he got off to a slow start but hit well in the second half of the season. He finished second to George Brett on his team in both home runs and RBIs with 20 and 98, respectively. The Royals won their division by 14 games to face the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series for the third time in four years. After having come up short in 1976, 1977 and 1978, the Royals swept the Yankees in three games in the 1980 American League Championship Series to face the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series. Aikens hit two home runs in Game 1 (his 26th birthday) and Game 4 of the World Series. He was, until Chase Utley accomplished the same feat in , the only player in World Series history to hit two home runs in the same game twice during the same World Series.\\"BASEBALL; Aikens Gets 20-Year Term\\", The New York Times December 13, 1994. He also collected the game-winning RBI in the tenth inning of Game 3, the Royals' first-ever win of a World Series game. Aikens batted .400, but the Royals lost the World Series in six games. Aikens led the Royals in both home runs and RBIs in the strike shortened season. His Royals returned to the postseason, but were swept by the Oakland Athletics in the 1981 American League Division Series. For his part, Aikens batted .333 (three for nine) and also reached base three times via base on balls. However, he failed to score or drive in any runs. He batted over .300 for the first time in his career in , only to see his career rapidly began to decline afterwards. Toward the end of the 1983 season, Aikens and several of his Royals teammates were questioned by U.S. attorney Jim Marquez in connection with a federal cocaine probe. Following the season, Aikens, Jerry Martin and Willie Wilson pleaded guilty to attempting to purchase cocaine, while former teammate Vida Blue pleaded guilty to possession of three grams of cocaine. Aikens, Blue, Martin and Wilson were all sentenced to three months in prison. =Toronto Blue Jays= Shortly after Aikens' November 17 sentencing, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for designated hitter Jorge Orta. Aikens was originally suspended by Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for a year. Following a May 15, review, he was reinstated, and joined his Toronto teammates in Minnesota the next day. In 93 games, Aikens hit 11 home runs and drove in 26. The Jays released Aikens a month into the season, and re-signed him to a minor league contract. In his final major league at bat, on April 27, Aikens walloped a pinch-hit two-run homer in the ninth inning to tie the ballgame -- the Blue Jays would win it in the tenth. Nevertheless, Aikens was let go and despite a healthy .311 batting average and 16 home runs with the Syracuse Chiefs, he never returned to the majors. He played four games for the New York Mets' AAA affiliate, the Tidewater Tides in before heading to Mexico to join the Mexican Pacific League's Yaquis de Obreg√≥n. Aikens played for six years in the Mexican League, where he was regularly among the league's top hitters; he batted .454 in 1986, one of the highest single-season averages in professional baseball history. Arrest Aikens was called to testify in the Pittsburgh drug trials of Curtis Strong as his major league career was winding down. His legal problems continued after his retirement, culminating in his being found guilty of selling 50 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover police officer and sentenced to 20 years and eight months in prison in 1994. Aikens had developed a heavy cocaine habit and, by his own admission, was constantly using the drug from 1991 to 1994. Supposedly, a former lover tipped off the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department that Aikens was selling narcotics at his home. Consequently, in December , the police put Aikens' condominium under surveillance. The police observed numerous individuals entering Aikens' home and then exiting after a brief stay. On December 8, 1993, an undercover police officer named Ginger Locke approached Aikens standing in the garage of his condominium and asked for directions. After Aikens gave Locke directions, he told her that he was listed in the phone book and asked her to call him sometime. Locke called Aikens numerous times in order to establish a rapport with him. On January 18, 1994, Locke called Aikens and told him that she had loaned her car to a friend, and that the friend had been caught with some \\"stuff\\", referring to crack cocaine, in the car. Locke's story initiated a discussion about narcotics. Eventually, Aikens let Locke know that he could get her \\"all the stuff\\" she wanted. Later that day, Locke drove to Aikens' home and asked him if she could buy an \\"eight ball\\", i.e. an eighth of an ounce of cocaine. Aikens asked Locke if she wanted her cocaine \\"hard\\", (crack form), or \\"soft\\", (powder form). She replied that she wanted it \\"hard.\\" Aikens pointed to some crack cocaine sitting on an ottoman in his den and indicated that he did not have a full \\"eight ball\\" of crack on hand. He told Locke that he would have to make some more. Using equipment which he kept in his den, Aikens quickly proceeded to make crack by mixing powder cocaine with baking soda in a glass beaker, pouring water on it, heating it with a hand-held torch, baking it in a microwave, and then rinsing it with cold water. Aikens weighed some of the crack that he had made, along with some of the crack which he already possessed, on a dial-a-gram scale, and sold it to Locke for $200. On January 24, 1994, Locke visited Aikens' home to buy more cocaine. Aikens had Locke drive him to his supplier's Kansas City home, where he used Locke's money to purchase powder cocaine. On the way back to Aikens' home, Aikens had Locke stop at stores where he could buy beakers and baking powder. When Aikens and Locke returned to Aikens' home, Aikens converted the powder cocaine into crack, and he sold the crack to Locke. On January 28 and February 23 of 1994, Locke returned to Aikens' home and arranged to buy more crack. On each occasion, Aikens called a supplier and had Locke accompany him while he obtained powder cocaine. On each occasion, Aikens converted the powder into crack upon returning to his home and sold the crack cocaine to Locke. In total, Aikens ending up selling about 2.2 ounces to the undercover cop. He was arrested on March 2, 1994, and after a March 17 mistrial, a grand jury indicted Aikens on four charges of crack cocaine distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C on March 25. Because of the tougher federal guidelines for crack, he was sentenced as if he had sold 15 pounds of powder cocaine. He received the maximum sentence of 15 years and eight months, and received an additional five years because he allegedly had a loaded gun in the room where the drugs were sold. Life after prison Aikens served his prison sentence in United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, and was scheduled to be released in 2012. He was released on June 4, 2008, three months after Congress approved new guidelines in the federal drug laws and made them retroactive. Hal McRae, the only former Royals teammate with whom Aikens corresponded while in prison, set Aikens up with a job in road construction, working in manholes. Since his release, Aikens has spoken at schools about his experiences and to the Royals' young players, always hoping to return to baseball. In November 2008, he apologized to Royals fans and the people of Kansas City in the Kansas City Star. On February 1, 2011, the Royals announced that they had hired Aikens as a minor league coach who will be based at the franchise's complex at Surprise, Arizona. The employment was delayed when his wife, Sara, suffered a stroke, believed to have been a complication of lupus. Aikens has three daughters: Nicole and Sarita with Sara, and Lucia from a previous relationship.

He played sixteen seasons, from 1989 to 2004, for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, Baltimore Orioles, Los Angeles Dodgers, Florida Marlins, Texas Rangers, New York Mets, Colorado Rockies, New York Yankees, and Montreal Expos. Zeile graduated from UCLA, where he played collegiate baseball primarily as a catcher. Only five players in MLB history have played for more teams. Playing careerEarly career= Zeile broke into the majors in 1989 as a catcher and the Cardinals' most anticipated prospect of the year. Cardinals manager Joe Torre wanted to make room for catcher Tom Pagnozzi and believed Zeile would be a more productive hitter and would have a longer career if he moved from behind the plate, so Zeile moved, with some reluctance, initially to first base and then to third base in 1990. =Middle career= Zeile spent most of the 1990s as a third baseman. He was traded from the Los Angeles Dodgers to the Florida Marlins along with Mike Piazza in 1998 for five players, then was traded to the Rangers later that season. In 1999, Zeile was part of a historic Rangers team. Along with Gregg Zaun and Jeff Zimmerman, he was one of three players on the team whose last names began with \\"Z\\". Not since the 1916 Chicago Cubs, with Heinie Zimmerman, Dutch Zwilling, and Rollie Zeider, had this occurred. Zeile ended the decade having committed more errors than any other player during the 1990s. In 2000, he then signed a contract with the New York Mets, where he rejoined Piazza, and moved to first base for the Mets in 2000, who wanted him to replace John Olerud. In 2002, he was traded to the Rockies, where he moved back to third base. He led all National League third basemen in errors in 2002, with 21, when he had the lowest fielding percentage in the league (.942). =End of career= After one season with Colorado, Zeile became a free agent again and signed with the Yankees in 2003. He was released mid-August and was signed by Montreal three days later. Having decided 2004 would be his last season, Zeile returned to the New York Mets. He also voiced displeasure with the Yankees, saying that he has \\"no desire to play again for that organization\\", and that \\"I think some of the things that happen over there are different than any other organization in baseball. I have a pretty good track record to judge that.\\"http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/story/7043630 Zeile retired following the 2004 season. Having planned his retirement in advance (and with the Mets well out of the playoff race), Mets manager Art Howe let Zeile once again start as a catcher, his original position, on September 18, 2004. It was Zeile's first appearance there in 14 years. It was the second-longest span ever between appearances at the position. Gabby Street caught a game in 1931 after last having caught in 1912. Zeile's span is now the third longest, since Craig Biggio started the final game of his career at catcher after a 16-year span. Zeile got one final start as a catcher two weeks later on October 3, 2004 in the season's final game, as the Mets' regular catcher, Jason Phillips's foot hurt him and he could not play. In the 6th inning, in his final at-bat as a major leaguer, Zeile hit a three-run home run to left-field off Montreal Expos pitcher Claudio Vargas. In the 8th inning, in his final play as a major leaguer, Ryan Church popped up to him, as a catcher, in foul territory. It was also John Franco's last out made as a Met pitcher. The Mets won the game, 8-1. Both games Zeile caught in his final season were started by Tom Glavine. He also pitched an inning with the Mets when they didn't have any pitchers left, as he gave up 5 runs in the 8th inning in the Mets' 19-10 loss to Montreal on July 26, 2004. It was his second appearance as a pitcher, having also appeared in a game for the Rockies in 2002. On October 3, 2004, he became one of 41 players (as of 2011) ever to hit a home run in his final at bat. Zeile's final home run also made him the last person ever to hit a home run off a Montreal Expos pitcher. Following that game, which was the last of the season, the Expos moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. Zeile ended his career having hit at least one home run for each of the 11 teams he played for over the course of his career, distinguishing him as the only player in major league history to have hit a home run for over 10 teams. Film work Since retiring from Major League Baseball, Zeile has pursued two other passions: film production, and acting. He founded Green Diamond Entertainment, a film production company in West Hollywood, California, during his second stint with the Mets. He appeared in the following: *Dirty Deeds (movie, 2005‚Äîproduced by Green Diamond Entertainment) *The King of Queens (television series, 2005‚Äì2006, two episodes) *Liquid: Live at Five (video, 2007) *Liquid: Money Talks (video, 2008) *Liquid: The Ten, Volume One (video, 2008) *I Am (movie, 2010) He was also executive producer of Dirty Deeds and a producer of I Am. Personal life Zeile attended William S. Hart High School in Newhall, California, where he was an outstanding student-athlete. Zeile is a direct descendant of Presidents John Quincy Adams and John Adams. Zeile was married to Olympic champion Julianne McNamara, the first American gymnast to earn a perfect 10.0 at the Olympics. They have four children, including son Garrett (b. November 27, 1993), and daughter Hannah (b. November 7, 1997), the latter who has Type 1 diabetes. As a result, Zeile and McNamara have been particularly active in juvenile diabetes research charities. They divorced in January 2015. Their daughter, Hannah, appears on the TV series This is Us as teenager Kate Pearson. On June 27, 2020, Zeile married Kristin Gamboa, daughter of ex-major league coach and minor league manager Tom Gamboa.

Ilya Golosov, Zuev Club, 1926 The Russian avant-garde was a large, influential wave of avant-garde modern art that flourished in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, approximately from 1890 to 1930‚Äîalthough some have placed its beginning as early as 1850 and its end as late as 1960. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that flourished at the time; including Suprematism, Constructivism, Russian Futurism, Cubo-Futurism, Zaum and Neo-primitivism. Many of the artists who were born, grew up or were active in what is now Belarus and Ukraine (including Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandra Ekster, Vladimir Tatlin, Wassily Kandinsky, David Burliuk, Alexander Archipenko), are also classified in the Ukrainian avant-garde. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the Russian Revolution of 1917 and 1932, at which point the ideas of the avant-garde clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of Socialist Realism. Artists and designers Notable figures from this era include: Journals * LEF * Mir iskusstva Filmmakers * Grigori Aleksandrov * Boris Barnet * Alexander Dovzhenko * Sergei Eisenstein * Lev Kuleshov * Yakov Protazanov * Vsevolod Pudovkin * Dziga Vertov Writers * Isaac Babel * Andrei Bely * Elena Guro * Velimir Khlebnikov * Daniil Kharms * Aleksei Kruchenykh * Vladimir Mayakovsky * Viktor Shklovsky * Sergei Tretyakov * Marina Tsvetaeva * Sergei Yesenin * Ilya Zdanevich One of the few writers for example, like the novelist, short story writer and essayist, Yevgeny Zamyatin (1884‚Äì1937), did not fully devote his writing career into experimenting with Russian avant-garde art, while instead, he decided of advocating and praising for the avant-garde movement, as a resistance to the becoming censorship of independent literary ideas in published and purchasable books in the U.S.S.R.Yevgeny Zamyatin's essay - Tomorrow (last paragraph - translated by Mirra Ginsburg.) He gave form for his ideas by writing books and pamphlets about the negatives of the singular ideology which was the state sponsored \\"Social Realism\\" and his opposition towards it. One of his quotes, \\"In art the surest way to destroy, is to canonize one given form and one philosophy,\\" (Essay - The New Russian Prose.)Yevgeny Zamyatin's essay - \\"The New Russian Prose\\" (p. 124, third paragraph, line 26-27 - translated by Mirra Ginsburg.) is one proof of his anti-totalitarian stance which is present throughout his whole literary career, most popularly in his novel \\"We\\" and his essay works. He particularly wrote about how can there be a beneficially progressive and developmental relationship between societies and the free expression of art, \\"But harmful literature is more useful than useful literature, for it is anti-entropic, it is a means of combating calcification, sclerosis, crust, moss, calmness\\" (Essay - Literature, Revolution, Entropy). Yevgeny Zamyatin's essay - \\"On Literature, Revolution, Entropy and Other Matters\\" (p. 109, paragraph 2, translated by Mirra Ginsburg and corrected to be closer to the original text by a Russian native speaker) Yevgeny Zamyatin's \\"We\\" and its ideological support for freedom for oneself and government, would influence writers in Western Europe and the U.S.A.

The tournament was sponsored by Tennent Caledonian Breweries and organised by the Scottish Football Association. When Tennent Caledonian Breweries withdrew their sponsorship after the 1993 event, the Sixes was discontinued. The format used was dependent on the number of teams participating: in most cases 10 teams were involved and would be drawn into 2 groups of 5 who would play each other once. From there, the first and second-placed teams from each group would contest the knockout stages, consisting of two semi-finals and a final. History The teams involved were usually from the Scottish Football League Premier Division, but occasionally guest participants from the lower divisions of the Scottish Football League were invited along with English clubs Nottingham Forest and Manchester City. The inaugural tournament was contested at Coasters Arena in Falkirk in 1984. The following year it took place at Ingliston Showground near Edinburgh, and all subsequent tournaments were played at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow. No individual team dominated the event over its history with Aberdeen, Heart of Midlothian and Rangers all winning the tournament twice each. Motherwell were beaten finalists on 3 occasions. The final team to win the Tennents Sixes was Partick Thistle; to this day they still have the trophy displayed in the Firhill trophy cabinet.http://www.tennents.com/football-timeline/#timeline-1984 Rules The rules of play evolved as the years progressed, and the following summary refers to the rules used during the final competition in 1993. Many were similar to indoor soccer in America, which in turn was developed with many influences, such as the use of a penalty box and making the pitch the same size as a NHL rink, from ice hockey. *A specially constructed artificial field, measuring approximately , with ice hockey-style boards topped with acrylic glass to a height of was used. Goals were set into the walls. *Squads consisted of up to 12 players, with no more than 6 on the field. Substitutions were unlimited and could be made at any time. *Matches were played in 2 halves of 7 minutes 30 seconds during the first round and 2 halves of 10 minutes during the knockout stages. At the end of all tied matches, even during the group phase, a penalty shoot-out would be held. A win on penalties in the group phase was worth 2 points as opposed to the 3 gained by winning after regulation time. *Two yellow lines separated the field into thirds. Players had to be inside this line to shoot on goal, and a three line pass rule (similar to ice hockey's two line pass rule) was in effect. *The goal area at each end was reserved for the sole use of the goalkeeper defending it. If an outfield player from the same team deliberately infringed on it a penalty kick would be awarded to the opposing team. *Goalkeepers could only hold on to the ball for six seconds. This was a particularly interesting situation as FIFA would later adopt this rule for conventional association football. *Teams were required to maintain a presence of at least 2 players in the opponents' half (1 player prior to 1991) or a penalty kick would be awarded to the opposing team. *Players shown the yellow card would be dispatched to the Sin Bin for 2 minutes. Aside from the normal offences, players could receive a yellow card for the Sixes-specific offence of deliberately kicking the ball over the perimeter wall to waste time.

The Ugab's mean run-off is roughly 20 million cubic metres per annum, its catchment area (including its tributaries) is estimated to be between 24,800 and . The Ugab River's large subterranean water content makes it a major Namibian River. Stretching for , the river provides water for species such as the rare desert elephant, as well as giraffe, mountain zebra and the largest population of free-roaming black rhinoceroses in the world. The Ugab Wilderness Area was established here to protect the future of these rare animals. Important tourism destinations are the Brandberg, the Doros Crater and Vingerklip, settlements in its catchment area are the towns of Outjo and Otjiwarongo, as well as the settlements of Kalkfeld, Omatjette and Uis. People can trek the length of the sandy river, passing local Herero farmers and the pink granite inselbergs (isolated rocky hills left behind after volcanic activity) dotted throughout the region. These bizarre stones have been shaped over the years into vaguely recognisable shapes, some look like toadstools, while others are eerie hollow structures known as the 'Petrified Ghosts'. Quite a few plants grow there; much of the visible vegetation is the wild tobacco (Nicotiana glauca). Also found there are some stunted acacia trees and «Énara bushes (Acanthosicyos horridus), with their almost-leafless spiky green stems, and improbably large melons.

Version 2 of the port mapper protocol maps ONC RPC program number/version number pairs to the network port number for that version of that program. When an ONC RPC server is started, it will tell the port mapper, for each particular program number/version number pair it implements for a particular transport protocol (TCP or UDP), what port number it is using for that particular program number/version number pair on that transport protocol. Clients wishing to make an ONC RPC call to a particular version of a particular ONC RPC service must first contact the port mapper on the server machine to determine the actual TCP or UDP port to use. Versions 3 and 4 of the protocol, called the rpcbind protocol, map a program number/version number pair, and an indicator that specifies a transport protocol, to a transport-layer endpoint address for that program number/version number pair on that transport protocol. The port mapper service always uses TCP or UDP port 111; a fixed port is required for it, as a client would not be able to get the port number for the port mapper service from the port mapper itself. The port mapper must be started before any other RPC servers are started. The port mapper service first appeared in SunOS 2.0.  Example portmap instance  This shows the different programs and their versions, and which ports they use. For example, it shows that NFS is running, both version 2 and 3, and can be reached at TCP port 2049 or UDP port 2049, depending on what transport protocol the client wants to use, and that the mount protocol, both version 1 and 2, is running, and can be reached at UDP port 644 or TCP port 645, depending on what transport protocol the client wants to use. $ rpcinfo -p program vers proto port 100000 2 tcp 111 portmapper 100000 2 udp 111 portmapper 100003 2 udp 2049 nfs 100003 3 udp 2049 nfs 100003 4 udp 2049 nfs 100003 2 tcp 2049 nfs 100003 3 tcp 2049 nfs 100003 4 tcp 2049 nfs 100024 1 udp 32770 status 100021 1 udp 32770 nlockmgr 100021 3 udp 32770 nlockmgr 100021 4 udp 32770 nlockmgr 100024 1 tcp 32769 status 100021 1 tcp 32769 nlockmgr 100021 3 tcp 32769 nlockmgr 100021 4 tcp 32769 nlockmgr 100005 1 udp 644 mountd 100005 1 tcp 645 mountd 100005 2 udp 644 mountd 100005 2 tcp 645 mountd 100005 3 udp 644 mountd 100005 3 tcp 645 mountd  Security concerns  The port mapper service was discovered to be used in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and Distributed Reflective Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks in 2015. By using a spoofed port mapper request, an attacker can amplify the effects on a target because a portmap query will return many times more data than in the original request.

Much of his business career centered on cotton trading. He and his three brothers-in-law formed a partnership that grew into the Anderson, Clayton and Company, at one time the world's largest cotton trading company. Politically aligned with the Democratic Party, he opposed some of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's agricultural policies. He repudiated his opposition after Roosevelt's Secretary of State Cordell Hull worked for a reciprocal trade agreement. Returning to government service in 1940, Clayton first Later in World War II, he took on a number of roles in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. He first served as deputy to the coordinator of inter-American affairs. For the next four years he held a variety of high-level positions with the Export- Import Bank, the Department of Commerce, and wartime agencies. He served as assistant, and then as deputy Secretary of State for economic affairs from December 1944 to October 1947, where he was primarily concerned with working on the Marshall Plan. He returned to Houston and private life in late 1947, though he continued to serve the government as a participant and contributor to various international conferences on world trade and other economic issues. Early life and career Born near Tupelo, Mississippi to James Monroe and Martha Fletcher (Burdine) Clayton, Will Clayton moved with his family in 1886, to Jackson, Tennessee, where he completed seven grades of public school. Leaving school at age 13, he became an expert stenographer, which earned him a job as private secretary to Jerome Hall, a Saint Louis cotton merchant. In 1896, Clayton went to work for the American Cotton Company in New York City, becoming an assistant general manager in 1904. He left the company later that year to join with two other partners (including his brother-in-law Monroe Dunaway Anderson) in starting Anderson, Clayton and Company, a cotton marketing firm based in Oklahoma City.174 Years of Historic Houston: Great Citizens - Will Clayton In 1916, the firm moved its headquarters to Houston, Texas, where it grew to be the world's largest cotton-trading enterprise. \\"Cotton & King,\\" Time Magazine, August 17, 1936. Government service Clayton entered government service in World War I as a member of the Cotton Distribution Committee of the War Industries Board. Although he was a Democrat, he opposed the New Deal agricultural policies of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the New Deal's free trade policies led him to support Roosevelt in the 1936 election.James A. Tinsley, \\"Clayton, William Lockhart\\" in Handbook of Texas Online. In 1940, Clayton returned to government service in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, then moved to the Export-Import Bank, where he worked to procure strategic materials for the United States and to deny them to Nazi Germany. After a series of administrative shuffles, Clayton found himself working under Vice President Henry A. Wallace. Disagreements between them led Clayton to resign in January 1944, only to return to government service a month later as Surplus War Property Administrator under James F. Byrnes in the Office of War Mobilization.John A. Garraty and Mark C. Carnes (eds.), Dictionary of American Biography, Supp. No. 8, 1966‚Äì1970, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons (1988) pp. 88‚Äì90. At the end of 1944, Clayton was named the first Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, a post that allowed him to promote the free trade policies that he believed in. He was a member of the Interim Committee appointed to advise Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and President Harry S. Truman on problems expected to arise from the development of the atomic bomb and he was an economic advisor to Truman at the Potsdam Conference. =Postwar career= Truman appointed Clayton as the first Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, a post Clayton held for 1946-47. In this role, Clayton witnessed the weakness of U.S. allies and their susceptibility to falling under the domination of the Soviet Union. He urged greater U.S. engagement with the world to halt the spread of communism. In a March 5 memo, Clayton wrote a fifteen-point manifesto for U.S. global leadership, in which he argued: > The reins of world leadership are fast slipping from Britain's competent, > but now very weak hands. These reins will be picked up either by the United > States or by Russia. If by Russia, there will almost certainly be a war in > the next decade or so, with the odds against us. If by the United States, > war can almost certainly be prevented.Untitled Memorandum, 5 March 1947, > Folder: Marshall Plan Memos, 1947, Box 60, Papers of William L. Clayton, > Harry S. Truman Presidential Library, Independence, Missouri Clayton strongly supported American economic aid to rebuild Europe after World War II and had a major role in shaping the Marshall Plan in 1947. After returning from a meeting at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe [ECE] ECE in Geneva in May, Clayton wrote a memo to George Marshall, entitled \\"The European Crisis,\\" in which he argued that U.S. economic aid was urgently needed to prevent the collapse of Europe. In this memo, he warned that \\"without further prompt and substantial aid from the United States, economic, social and political disintegration will overwhelm Europe Charles Bohlen, when drafting the announcement of the Marshall Plan, drew heavily from Clayton's memo.'' In 1948, he returned to his private business in Houston, but remained active in efforts to promote free trade and economic cooperation between the United States and its allies during the Cold War. Clayton was also an early advocate of improved relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China,Priscilla Roberts, \\"William L.Clayton and the recognition of China, 1945-1966: more speculations on 'lost chances in China',\\" Journal of American-East Asian Relations, 7:1-2, (Spring-Summer 1998): 5-37. In 1963, when Clayton was in his eighties, President John F. Kennedy asked him to work on the national export expansion program and the limited nuclear test ban treaty. The William L.

It was founded by former Georgetown University rower and Olympian Mike Vespoli in 1980. http://www.vespoli.com/history History The company‚Äôs origins date back to the late 1970s when Mike Vespoli was the freshman rowing coach at Yale University. It was during a trip to the Henley Royal Regatta in 1977 that he saw the forefather of the shell that changed his life. The now defunct British firm, Carbocraft Ltd, was building shells that sandwiched honeycomb between composite fibers. \\"I saw a very advanced shell, realizing, in America at the time, we were rowing in either traditionally built wooden shells or a wooden shell frame with fiberglass skin over it,\\" Vespoli said. He began to augment a modest coaching salary by becoming Carbocraft's American sales representative. In their day, Carbocrafts were exceptional boats, and the sport of rowing owes Carbocraft for the breakthroughs the company made in carbon-honeycomb shells. After three years as Carbocraft's agent, Mike Vespoli realized importing boats led to unacceptable shortfalls in service. Customers were dissatisfied with fluctuating boat prices due to unpredictable exchange rates, an unreliable supply of spare parts, and uncertain delivery dates. In the summer of 1980, he decided to leave coaching to become a boat builder. By the fall, Mike had secured the rights to manufacture Carbocraft shells in the United States and opened a . shop in Hamden, CT with his father and two employees, Peter Smith, a plant foreman from England, and Ed Kloman, an oarsman turned business executive. In the beginning Vespoli kept the basic Carbocraft design, which came to be known as the ‚ÄúA‚Äù hull model but he improved the construction techniques. Vespoli's new shells were well accepted and soon he talked the city of New Haven into selling him land for a modern boat-building plant. The end of the decade was a busy time for Vespoli. In 1986 Vespoli moved production to its current location in New Haven. In 1988, Vespoli initiated the most comprehensive rowing shell research ever. Utilizing the talents of America‚Äôs Cup winning naval architect Bruce Nelson and hydrodynamics‚Äô expert, Dr. Carl Scragg, they were the first to simulate shell movement in a tow tank with ‚Äúunsteady‚Äù surge and pitch. Thus the ‚ÄúD‚Äù hull model was born. The \\"D\\" hull which became wildly accepted and praised during the 1990s had a very inauspicious start. Some contest that the United States Heavyweight Eight might have won the gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, or probably would have won the silver, instead of taking the bronze behind West Germany and the Soviet Union, if they had chosen to use the new ‚ÄúD‚Äù hull rather than the familiar 'A' hull, called Copenhagen Gold, which the crew preferred. In the first half of this decade, Vespoli partnered with naval architect, Manolo Ruiz DeElvira, the principal designer of Alinghi, winner of the 2003 and 2007 America‚Äôs Cup. Manolo used to the most advanced hull design programs in the world to design Vespoli‚Äôs next generation of hulls, the ‚ÄúE‚Äù Hull. The \\"E\\" hull features increased stability and lower wetted surface [the dominant factor in slowing a rowing boat]. This model offers both wing and side mount rigger options.

Early Years Robert Todd Storz (known as Todd to avoid confusion with his father) was the grandson of Omaha brewer Gottlieb Storz. His father, Robert H. Storz, positioned himself as a ‚Äúmover and shaker‚Äù in Omaha, Nebraska. He joined his eldest brother Adolph in running the Storz Brewing Company, and became active in local associations and activities. Indeed, Robert Storz played a role in getting the U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC) headquarters to relocate to Omaha in 1957. SAC's huge and growing payroll portended good business for Storz beer. Having no interest in the beer business, however, young Todd Storz was far more attracted to the potential of broadcast radio. He built a crude AM radio crystal receiver when he was only eight, and from then on, was ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on radio. In 1940 Todd passed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) amateur ham radio license examination, and set up his receiver and transmitter on the third floor of the family home. Robert H. enrolled Todd at the prestigious Choate school in Connecticut, hoping that his son would pay more attention to academics than to radio. Instead, he became president of the Choate Radio Club. In 1942, he transferred to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, where he put an unlicensed AM station on the air, though it was quickly shut down by the FCC. Todd enlisted in the Army in 1943 and served as a warrant officer junior grade in the Signal Corps. When he mustered out in 1946, he enrolled in a 12-week radio course sponsored by NBC and Northwestern University. Next, he took a low-paying ‚Äújack-of-all-trades‚Äù job at KWBW in Hutchinson, Kansas, to gain some commercial radio experience. He returned to Omaha in 1947 to take on a sales position at KFAB‚Äîand to marry Elizabeth Ann Trailer. Station Acquisitions and A New Sound In mid-April 1949, Robert and Todd Storz announced their purchase of KOWH-AM and its FM companion outlet KOAD from the owners of the Omaha World Herald. The elder Storz was named president and his son became vice-president and general manager. For the first two years under Storz management, KOWH followed industry practice and offered a varied ‚Äúconglomeration of programming‚Äù that resulted in only four percent of Omaha homes listening even once to the station in a sample week. By mid-1951 however, KOWH began to turn around as Todd observed that audience ratings rose when recorded music was played but declined when talk shows were aired. He concluded that listeners wanted most to hear hit records. By the fall of 1953, all of KOWH's programming was being produced in-house, featuring local announcers, recorded popular music, and a wide array of promotional jingles. In an era when network and local radio were relying on a more staid variety of short programs designed to appeal to a specific slice of the available audience for a finite amount of time, the Storz operation offered a single program type‚Äîrecorded hit music‚Äîduring all of its broadcast hours. Ratings showed that KOWH's music appealed to the largest percentage of audience of any independent (non-network) radio outlet in the country. Playing popular music, and repeating the top-selling (‚ÄúTop-40‚Äù) hits most often, was the main engine driving KOWH's phenomenal audience growth. This was the beginning of a radio revolution, which would soon expand to six other Storz stations, beginning with WTIX, New Orleans in 1953, which also became phenomenally successful despite having a weak signal. Todd Storz went on to buy WHB in Kansas City in 1954, WDGY in Minneapolis/St. Paul in January 1956, WQAM in Miami in May 1956, KOMA in Oklahoma City in 1958, and KXOK in St. Louis in 1960. Most of the later acquisitions enjoyed top-notch technical facilities. Storz could easily afford their purchase. Other station operators took notice of the Storz phenomenon and began to program similar tightly- formatted Top-40 music. The Unraveling In January 1961 Todd's wife of fourteen years filed for divorce. A month later Storz announced that the company had designated a Miami Beach building as the company's new national headquarters. In retrospect, there were several good reasons for Storz to move his home and office from Omaha to Miami Beach. Doing so would distance him from his failed marriage, remove him somewhat from his father's close scrutiny, provide him with a fresh location more in keeping with a modern, upbeat corporate identity, offer hoped-for relief from a persistent sinus condition and migraine headaches, and bring him closer to the woman who soon become his second wife‚Äìstation WQAM's receptionist. But the changes were short-lived. On April 13, 1964, Todd Storz was found dead at his Miami Beach home. He was about three and a half weeks shy of his 40th birthday. The coroner's report cited ‚Äúpulmonary congestion and edema‚Äù and ‚Äúmarked coronary and aortic narrowing‚Äù as the probable causes. However, a second cause of death might have been barbiturate intoxication. The drug in question was Tuinal, which was sometimes prescribed to insomniacs to help induce sleep. Tuinal was known to be dangerous because the amount of the drug that induces drowsiness is only slightly less than the amount that can lead to death. But the specific cause of Todd's premature death was never determined. Robert H. Storz took over the operation of the Storz Broadcasting Company, shifting the headquarters back to Omaha. With Todd gone, his vision, of how compelling radio could be, relied upon the station managers and staff he had trained. But, as former Storz station manager Deane Johnson later put it, ‚ÄúTodd's death [and the control of the radio stations falling to Todd's father] brought about a shift from a 'programming company' to a 'money company.' ‚Äú That is a succinct description of the shift in the Storz stations' focus that transpired after Todd's death. Unfortunately, Robert Storz neither understood nor acknowledged that Top-40 programming was central to the success of the company Todd had run. Instead, the senior Storz complained that station managers were spending too much money. Indeed, he had such a programming \\"disconnect\\" on what the stations were doing that he once asked KXOK manager Jack Sampson if the station \\"could play some Lawrence Welk from time to time, or a lively Sousa march in the morning.\\" The managers humored him and did whatever they could to keep the elder Storz from changing the established programming elements that had made the Storz organization so successful. But they could only do so much as their own influence waned in the 1970s. The Sell-Off After years of declining audiences and revenues, the six Storz AM stations were sold between April 1984 and September 1985 for prices far below what they would have fetched during their heyday under Todd's guidance. The order in which the stations were sold, and their value in 2017 dollars is as follows: WTIX, New Orleans, $7,066,400; KOMA, Oklahoma City, $7,066,400; WDGY, Minneapolis, approximately $3,000,000; WHB, Kansas City, sale price not determined; KXOK, St. Louis, $4,710,933; and WQAM, Miami, $6,713,080. The decline of the Storz Broadcasting Company is instructive because‚Äîas the saying goes--\\"It didn't have to be this way.\\" If management had purchased FM facilities as the medium grew after 1970, and if inventive program directors and managers had been adequately supported, the company might have continued to be a programming innovator‚Äînot only retaining but further expanding its audience. Still, for nearly three decades, the Storz stations were the epitome of innovative, memorable, and delightful radio broadcasting. They were the most fun you could have with your ears.

He was nicknamed \\"the Maverick of Radio.\\" McLendon is widely credited for perfecting, during the 1950s and 1960s, the commercially successful Top 40 radio format created by Todd Storz. He also developed offshore pirate radio broadcasting to both Scandinavia and the British Isles. In addition, he was active in circles of conservative business-political power in the 1960s until the time of his death. Background McLendon was born in Paris, Texas, and spent his early childhood in Oklahoma. The family moved to Atlanta, Texas, Texas where he attended high school and began to develop his interest in broadcasting. He covered sports events and broadcast commentary over the school's public address system. He graduated from Kemper Military Academy. He won a nationwide political-essay contest judged by journalists Arthur Brisbane, Henry Luce, and Walter Lippmann. After being accepted to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, he decided to attend Yale because it was the only school that didn't offer him a scholarship. At Yale, he was editor of the Yale Literary Magazine and a member of Chi Psi, a Yale fraternity. McLendon fought in World War II and was commissioned as an intelligence officer in the Office of Naval Intelligence. He was later reassigned, giving him the opportunity to extend his style of commentary to political events over a United States Armed Forces Radio Service station. He then briefly attended Harvard Law School but left prematurely to buy an interest in a station in Palestine, Texas, KNET. McLendon was married in 1943 to Gay Noe, daughter of James A. Noe, former governor of Louisiana; in 1973 he married Susan Stafford, a syndicated columnist, radio talk-show host, and actress. McLendon was known for his elaborate practical jokes, orchestrated on such notables as sitting President Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover both of whom he called friends. He was a member of the board of stewards of Highland Park Methodist Church in Dallas and the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Texas chairman of the March of Dimes, and an honorary chairman of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Poppy Drive. In 1964‚Äì65 he served as a communications adviser to the United States Peace Corps. In 1971 he conducted a month-long all-expense-paid broadcasting course for nine minority-group members, including African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican-Americans. BroadcastingLiberty Broadcasting System= McLendon, who nicknamed himself \\"The Old Scotchman\\", is also noted in radio history as the founder of the Liberty Radio Network (noted for its daily national broadcasts of Major League Baseball) in the 1940s. Liberty was the second largest radio network in the U.S. at the time with over 458 affiliated stations. Most of Liberty's MLB broadcasts were re-creations of games, utilizing McLendon himself and future sportscasting stars such as Lindsey Nelson and Jerry Doggett on play-by-play. It was a live, not recreated game that provided McLendon and Liberty with their greatest career moment. The Old Scotchman himself was behind the Liberty microphone at the Polo Grounds in New York for the October 3, 1951 finale of the three-game National League play-off series between the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers. Bobby Thomson of the Giants swung at Dodger Ralph Branca's 0‚Äì1 pitch in the last of the ninth with two runners aboard, and McLendon barked: :Bobby swings, there's a long one out there out to left! Going, going, GONE and the Giants win the pennant! Gordon then went silent and let the crowd's roar speak for itself. With radio still the more popular nationwide medium then, and with Russ Hodges' famous radio call limited to WMCA and its Giants' network, McLendon's call is how most Americans heard the NL clincher. =Offshore Pirate radio= For a time he owned a converted fishing boat in the North Sea which beamed into Sweden and other European countries. In 1960 McLendon and his close friend Clint Murchison owned Radio Nord which broadcast from an offshore facility that was called a pirate radio station by the Swedish government because it was located on board a radio ship and outside of their legal jurisdiction. When that venture came to an end the vessel was brought back to Galveston, Texas where the ship remained for a year until it was leased to a British operation. The new 1964 station was called Radio Atlanta (after McLendon's home town). Unfortunately due to blunders in keeping the project secret, these plans were shared with Jocelyn Stevens, editor of Queen magazine in London, who was a financial supporter of another station, Radio Caroline. Later in 1964 McLendon shared his experience at offshore broadcasting with Don Pierson of Eastland, Texas, who created a mirror of McLendon's KLIF radio station in Dallas. That new incarnation was to have been called Radio KLIF London, but when it came on air it was identified as Radio London. =U.S. radio stations= McLendon and his father founded radio station KLIF (The Mighty 1190) in Oak Cliff, Dallas, Texas in 1947, and introduced the Top 40 format there in the early 1950s to great success. KLIF enjoyed a long run at the top of the Dallas radio ratings in the 1950s and 1960s, but its standing in the market fell in the early 1970s thanks to growing competition from FM radio. One of the FM stations most instrumental in the downfall of KLIF was its former sister station KNUS (now KLUV), of which McLendon retained ownership after selling KLIF and revamped as a rock-oriented Top 40. The McLendon family built a communications empire that included radio stations across the United States. In addition to KLIF, McLendon owned KNUS‚ÄìFM in Dallas, KOST in Los Angeles, WYNR (later WNUS) & WNUS-FM in Chicago, WWWW‚ÄìFM in Detroit, KEEL in Shreveport, WAKY in Louisville, KABL in Oakland, KABL‚ÄìFM in San Francisco, KILT in Houston, KTSA in San Antonio, and KELP in El Paso. McLendon introduced the all-news format to Southern California through XETRA in Tijuana. McLendon was one of the originators of the \\"beautiful music\\" format on his KABL in Oakland, California in 1959; and as the founder of the first all-news radio station (WNUS in Chicago) in the 1960s. He is credited by most broadcast historians with having established the first mobile news units in American radio, the first traffic reports, the first jingles, the first all-news radio station, and the first \\"easy-listening\\" programming. He also was among the first broadcasters in the United States to editorialize. McLendon especially attracted attention for his stern denunciations of French president Charles De Gaulle, whom he described as \\"an ungrateful four-flusher\\" who could \\"go straight to hell.\\" The McLendon family sold KLIF in 1971 to Fairchild Industries of Germantown, Maryland, for $10.5 million, then a record price for a radio station. By 1979 the family had sold all of its broadcasting properties, including fourteen radio and two television stations, worth approximately $100 million. By 1985 Forbes magazine estimated McLendon's net worth at $200 million. =Television= In 1954, McLendon considered acquiring a share of Oklahoma City UHF station KMPT, but opted against it, finding the struggling station \\"too far gone\\" (it closed a year later). McLendon was also the last owner of ABC affiliate KCND-TV in Pembina, North Dakota. In 1975, he sold that station to Winnipeg executive Izzy Asper, who moved the station to Winnipeg and used it to start up CKND-TV, which would become the genesis of the present-day Canwest media empire and the modern-day Global Television Network. Movies and theatres In 1959, McLendon co-produced two sci-fi monster movies filmed in Texas, The Killer Shrews and The Giant Gila Monster. Both are now considered cult classic B-films and were even featured on the show Mystery Science Theater 3000 in the 1990s. He produced over 150 motion- picture campaigns for United Artists from 1963 to 1966. At one point, he became the largest shareholder in Columbia Pictures. He was the executive producer of Escape to Victory, directed by John Huston and starring Michael Caine, Sylvester Stallone, and Max von Sydow. He also owned McLendon Theatres, which operated more than forty movie theatres throughout the south, including many drive-ins. Oil McLendon's father-in-law was former Louisiana Governor and oil magnate James A. Noe who, along with his partner, Governor Huey Long, formed the controversial Win or Lose Oil Company. The firm was established to obtain leases on state-owned lands so that the directors might collect bonuses and sublease the mineral rights to the major oil companies. Although ruled legal, these activities were done in secret and the stockholders were unknown to the public. Noe and Long made a profit on the bonuses and the resale of those state leases, using the funds primarily for political purposes. Author McLendon became an authority on precious metals and wrote a book entitled Get Really Rich in the Coming Super Metals Boom, published in 1981. He also authored a number of other books, including How to Succeed in Broadcasting (1961), Correct Spelling in Three Hours (1962), Understanding American Government (1964), and 100 Years of America in Sound (1965). Politics McLendon, a conservative Democrat, garnered only 43 percent of the vote in a primary race against incumbent US Senator Ralph Yarborough in 1964. During the campaign he was accompanied by such Hollywood luminaries as John Wayne, Chill Wills, and Robert Cummings. He entered the primary for the 1968 Texas gubernatorial election, but withdrew from both the election and the Democratic Party, citing President Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam War policies. Jack Ruby was an admirer of McLendon. Later life In December 1985, McLendon was reported to have been critically wounded while cleaning his a .38-caliber pistol. He died of cancer at his ranch home near Lake Dallas, Texas, on September 14, 1986. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1994.

He died at the age of sixteen when he was transferred to Auschwitz concentration camp and gassed to death upon arrival. His diary was posthumously published. Life Earth seen from the Moon Petr was born into the family of Otto Ginz, a manager of the export department of a textile company from Prague and notable Esperantist, and Marie Ginz (n√©e Dolansk√°). Petr's father was Jewish, and his mother was not. His parents met at an Esperantist congress. His mother was from Hradec Kr√°lov√© where her father was a village teacher. Petr got frequent visits from his relatives during Christmas including his grandfather who owned an antique shop in Jungmann Square where he sold rare books. Petr was a very intelligent boy; between the ages of 8 and 14 he wrote 5 novels: From Prague to China, The Wizard from Altay Mountains, Around the World in One Second and A Visit from Prehistory ‚Äî the only surviving novel today. The novels, including N√°v≈°tƒõva z pravƒõku (), were written in the style of Jules Verne and illustrated with his own paintings. He was interested in the sciences and yearned for knowledge. Because of his parents' interest in Esperanto, this was one of the native languages of Petr (the other one being Czech). According to the anti-Jewish laws of the Third Reich, children from mixed marriages were to be deported to a concentration camp at the age of 14. Young Petr was transported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in October 1942. His efforts in sciences and thirst for knowledge remained and he tried to study even in the concentration camp. He often read from the library full of confiscated books to which he had access. He was placed in the Domov ƒç.1 (Home No. 1, building L417). He became one of the most significant individuals of the community. He established and prepared for publication the periodical magazine Vedem which means \\"We Lead.\\" He also wrote an Esperanto‚ÄìCzech dictionary as well as several other short novels that have been lost. One such piece of writing is called 'The Rambles through Theresienstadt' where he interviews and comments on people, buildings and even the crematorium. The breadth of his interests, abilities and character are determined from his writings that remain and from the testimonials of friends who survived. He was interested in literature, history, paintings, geography, sociology and also in the technical fields. The magazine Vedem was published every Friday for two years. Petr was assigned to one of the last transports to Auschwitz concentration camp from Terez√≠n, where he died in the gas chambers in 1944. His diary has been published in English under the name: The Diary of Petr Ginz 1941‚Äì1942. Vedem The magazine was founded shortly after his arrival at Terez√≠n in 1942. Besides Ginz, several other boys from the Domov ƒç.1. also contributed. Petr Ginz became a chief editor and he contributed under the code name nz or Akademie (Academy). One of his closest collaborators was Hanu≈° Hachenburg who wrote many poems. Ginz gave most of his writings and paintings to his sister before his transport, so a majority have survived to today. His sister was also deported to Terez√≠n in 1944, but she survived. Diary Vƒõra and Vlastimil Novobilsk√Ω reading aloud from their Esperanto translation of Petr Ginz's diary for members of the Esperanto club in Brno (2013) Before his transport, Ginz wrote a diary between 1941 and 1942 about his life. This diary, written in a matter-of-fact way, has been compared to Anne Frank's diary. This diary was lost for a long time but was later found and published by his sister Eva (now Chava Pressburger) as Diary of My Brother. The diary was published in Spanish, Catalan, and Esperanto, as well as the original Czech. It was published in English in April 2007 as The Diary of Petr Ginz 1941‚Äì1942. It was reviewed in The New York Times on Tuesday 10 April 2007. Drawing Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, whose mother and grandmother were survivors of Auschwitz, was asked by S. Isaac Mekel, director of development at the American Society for Yad Vashem, to take an item from Yad Vashem onto the American Space Shuttle Columbia. Ramon carried with him a copy of a drawing by Ginz of the planet Earth as seen from the Moon. The shuttle, while reentering Earth's atmosphere, broke apart on 1 February 2003, destroying the copy of Ginz's drawing on what would have been his 75th birthday. In 2018, 15 years after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, another copy was given by Yad Vashem to Ilan's widow, Rona, to give to astronaut Andrew Feustel. Feustel carried it to space during Expedition 56 in memory of Ginz and Ramon. Feustel's video message commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day (Yom HaShoah) 2018/5778 featured the astronaut displaying Ginz's depiction of a view of Earth from the Moon.https://www.jta.org/2018/04/12/news-opinion/united- states/us-astronaut-records-holocaust-remembrance-message-space Petr Ginz's drawing and its fateful history have inspired other pieces of art. One example is the painting Variation on Petr Ginz's Moon Landscape (2008) by Panamanian artist Roberto Perez-Franco.Variation on Petr Ginz's Moon Landscape  Legacy  Stolperstein for Petr Ginz in front of St√°rkova 1745/4 in Prague The asteroid 50413 Petrginz was named in his honour. In 2005 the Czech Post edited a 31 Kƒå stamp with the Moon drawing and a portrait in remembrance of Petr Ginz. In Prague a Stolperstein by German artist Gunter Demnig was installed. His life was commemorated in a 2012 documentary film, The Last Flight of Petr Ginz, directed by Sandra Dickson and Churchill Roberts.

He represented the ridings of Humber and Etobicoke‚ÄîHumber. Background Henderson was educated at the University of Toronto, the University of Western Ontario, Johns Hopkins University, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. He worked as a physician, psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, Director of Psychiatry at the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital in Toronto and the Royal Victoria Hospital in Barrie before entering political life, and served as an associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry, and Psychiatrist in Chief for the Student Health Services, at the University of Toronto. Politics He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1985, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Morley Kells by about 2,000 votes in the Toronto constituency of Humber. The Liberal Party formed a minority government after this election. Henderson states that his decision to enter politics was as simple as stepping off the street car and saying \\"I want to be a candidate\\" at the Liberal constituency office for the riding. Initially Henderson was named as the parliamentary assistant (PA) for the Ministry of Community and Social Services. In 1986, Henderson took a highly public stance against the Liberal government in its attempt to ban extra-billing by doctors, a practice by which physicians bill patients directly an amount in addition to what is provided by the provincial health plan, and was generally supportive of doctors in their illegal strike that followed. Consequently, he fell into disfavour with the premier David Peterson, and was generally regarded as being on the political right of the Liberal Party. He was later appointed as PA for the Ministry of Colleges and Universities. In the 1987 provincial election he was re-elected by an increased margin in the redistributed riding of Etobicoke‚ÄîHumber. He again served as a PA to the Ministry of Colleges and Universities, before being appointed as PA for a minister without portfolio responsible for the province's Anti-Drug Strategy. The Liberals were upset by the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, although Henderson managed to defeat his NDP opponent by about 3,500 votes. He served as his party's critic for Culture and Communications in the parliament which followed. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the 1995 provincial election, and Henderson was defeated by PC challenger Doug Ford, Sr. (the father of Toronto city councillor Rob Ford). While a private member of the legislature, Henderson brought forward a private member's bills on several topics. One such bill, Bill 95, which received first reading in 1988, would have amended the Children's Law Reform Act, to create a presumption of joint custody for parents in the event of a divorce, absent evidence of harm to the children, and required mandatory mediation of custody disputes. In another, which received first reading in 1987, would have allowed individuals to request anonymous HIV testing by amending the mandatory reporting requirements in the Health Protection and Promotion Act. He also proposed a private member's bill to give members greater freedom to take positions consistent with their constituent's views and individual perspective. In 1997, he wrote favourably in The Globe and Mail of a meeting he had had with Fidel Castro several years earlier. After politics, he returned to the practice of psychoanalysis in the City of Toronto until 2011.

Triacetate is commonly used for the creation of fibres and film base. It is chemically similar to cellulose acetate. Its distinguishing characteristic is that in triacetate, at least \\"92 percent of the hydroxyl groups are acetylated.\\"Federal Trade Commission definition During the manufacture of triacetate, the cellulose is completely acetylated; whereas in normal cellulose acetate or cellulose diacetate, it is only partially acetylated. Triacetate is significantly more heat resistant than cellulose acetate. History Triacetate, whose chemical equation is [C6H7O2(OOCCH3)3]n, was first produced commercially in the U.S. in 1954 by Celanese Corporation. Eastman Kodak was a manufacturer of CTA until March 15, 2007. For almost 3 years, Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd. was the only manufacturer. In 2010, Eastman Chemical announced a 70% increase in cellulose triacetate output at its Kingsport (TN) manufacturing site to achieve the increasing demand for the chemical's use as an intermediate in the production of polarized films for liquid crystal displays. Production Triacetate is derived from cellulose by acetylating cellulose with acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride. Acetylation converts hydroxyl groups in cellulose to acetyl groups, which renders the cellulose polymer much more soluble in organic solvents. The cellulose acetate is dissolved in a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol for spinning. As the filaments emerge from a spinneret, the solvent is evaporated in warm air, in a process known as dry spinning, leaving a fibre of almost pure triacetate. A finishing process called S-Finishing or surface saponification is sometimes applied to acetate and triacetate fabrics using a sodium hydroxide solution. This removes part or all of the acetyl groups from the surface of the fibres leaving them with a cellulose coating. This reduces the tendency for the fibres to acquire a static charge.

It lies immediately east of Finsbury Park, north of Stoke Newington, west of Stamford Hill and Seven Sisters, south of Harringay. The area was originally considered to be part of Woodberry Down. However, the construction of the Seven Sisters Road and the consequent establishment of the Manor House Tavern gave rise to the alternative name Manor House CrossroadsNorth London Mercury and Crouch End Echo, Nov 11 1899. With the arrival of the tube station in 1932, the area immediately around the tube station began to be known as Manor House. The demolition of the once very fashionable area of Woodberry Down and its replacement with one of London's biggest public housing estates resulted in 'Woodberry Down' being used to refer to the public housing area and 'Manor House' for the area beyond. With the regeneration of the Woodberry Down Estate during the early part of the 21st Century, much of the area, rather than just the housing estate, is now being referred to once again by its nineteenth-century name of 'Woodberry Down'. Location Built up during the middle part of the nineteenth century as part of an area called Woodberry Down, Manor House is now a small district without a formal town centre, but distant enough from other town centres that it has come to be referred to as an area. Taking its name from the Manor House Tavern (see below), via the Manor House tube station, it is centred at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Green Lanes. The western border is defined by Finsbury Park in the neighbourhood of Harringay. Its other borders are defined by the New River, which loops around it on three sides.Google map showing the rough boundaries of Manor House. The area consists mainly of the Woodberry Down Estate, but there are also two small shopping areas, a school and a pub. Manor House, looking East along Seven Sisters Road, c 1905 HistoryEarly development= Prior to any building development, the area was part of the demesne lands of Stoke Newington Manor. It was known as 'Berrie Down Wood' in the seventeenth century and 'Wood Berry Downs Meadow' a hundred years later.How Woodberry Down Got its Name http://www.harringayonline.com/forum/topics/how-woodberry-down-got-its-name- and-maybe-manor-house-too Building started on Green Lanes with the appearance in 1821 of a large house at a spot that would later be the site of the junction with Woodberry Down (the road). Further north on Green Lanes, just to the south of the New River, Northumberland House, a three-storeyed building with a pillared entrance, balustrade, and urns on its roof, was completed in 1822.Original plans of Northumberland House in Bulletin 51, Pickering & Chatto, May 2016Whilst no evidence has yet been unearthed that links the house to the Percys, the Dukes of Northumberland, the presence of the Percy lion over the gates suggests that there may have been a link. The Percys also had a historic connection to the area, once owning a house on Newington Green (Old and New London: Volume 2.

Woodberry Down Cottages, four detached houses on the south side of Woodberry Down, had been built by 1829. Manor House tavern was built nearby in 1830. With the development of Finsbury Park almost a certainty, the land to the south and east of the present-day park was acquired by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners as ideal for building. The park was laid out between 1857 and 1869 and the adjacent land was sold to builders. During the 1860s, Thomas John Angell, who appears to have been a speculator rather than a builder, built Finsbury Park Villas. This was a terrace of at least twelve houses, which, starting with the Finsbury Park Tavern, ran northward along Green Lanes from its junction with the new Woodberry Grove. At around the same time, Angell and a London builder Thomas Oldis were responsible for development that began to spread eastward along the north side of Seven Sisters Road. From 1868 to 1870 large detached houses with gardens running down to the New River were built at the east end of Seven Sisters Road. In 1867 were leased on the southern side of the eastern end of the road, for the building of four detached or nine 'substantial' houses; three detached houses were built by 1871. An architect, William Reddall of Finsbury, was one of those who leased the houses. Woodberry Down was laid out in 1868, when it was extended eastward from Lordship Road, and villas were built on the south side in the late 1860s. The area was the northern section of a district called Brownswood Park (named after Brownswood Manor) and was regarded as a particularly select suburb. However, with the increasing suburbanisation of the area, mainly for the middle and lower middle classes, many of the original families had moved out by 1895 and others were being replaced by poorer people in 1913. Social decline continued, until in 1954 the district was inhabited mainly by students, foreigners, and the working class, with most houses containing four or five families and all in decay. =Twentieth-century redevelopment - the Woodberry Down Estate= From 1949 through to the 1970s much of the area was redeveloped, the old houses being demolished and replaced with a large council development known locally as Woodberry Down. The LCC compulsorily purchased the area for this purpose in 1934 in order to alleviate chronic housing shortages, but work did not begin till after the Second World War . Construction began in 1949 and the 57 blocks of flats were completed in 1962. Initially, the estate offered greatly improved living conditions for tenants. However, over time, the estate suffered the problems of comparably idealistic, post-war, social housing projects. By the late 1980s, many of the flats were in a poor state of repair, while many more were empty and boarded up with metal shutters. =1980s squatter community= Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the increasing number of abandoned properties on the estate became occupied by a growing squatter community. The squatters at Woodberry Down Estate were predominantly young punks from all over the UK and Ireland. Several had squatted previously in the Noel Park area in Wood Green. The squatters‚Äô relationship with tenants ranged from amicable to antagonistic, but the two communities generally managed to co-exist without too much hostility. The strong community spirit, which existed among residents in the 1950s was still evident to a lesser extent during this time, and the estate managed to avoid the more extreme crime and social problems often associated with inner- city housing projects. The sharp increase in numbers of squatters has clear links to the huge increases in homelessness in London that resulted from Thatcherite policies, such as the Right to Buy scheme (introduced in the Housing Act 1980).Thatcherite policies condemned for causing 'unjust premature death' The Manor House Tavern The Original Manor House pub, looking north towards Harringay, c.1860 The tavern was the source of the name of the tube station and consequently the immediate vicinity. The first tavern on the site was built by Stoke Newington builder Thomas WiddowsT. F. T. Baker & R. B. Pugh (Editors), A History of the County of Middlesex, Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate, Accessed online at British History Online, 1976 between 1830 and 1834Baker & Pugh (see previous reference) state that the pub was built \\"by 1832\\". However, the pub's first landlord advertised is as a new building in 1834, see below next to the turnpike on Green Lanes. Prior to this date a cottage had existed on the site,Described as \\"Cottage and Garden. On the Eastern Side of the Green Lanes, opposite the Road leading to Hornsey Wood House\\" in the Schedule of the Act to amend an Act of the Seventh Year of His Present Majesty for Consolidating the Trusts of the Several Turnpike Roads in the Neighbourhood of the Metropolis, North of the River Thames, and to make and maintain Two New or Branch Road to communicate with the said Metropolis Road, pp 853-863 of The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 11, George Eyre and Andrew Strahan, Printers to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, 1829\\". The cottage was built c. 1810. No building is shown on map OSD 152 / Serial 104 Hampstead 1807 - 08 at Hackney Archives, but one does appear on the 1814 Map of the Parish and Prebendal Manor of the Parish of Stoke Newington, also at Hackney Archives. On Crutchley's 1829 map, the building is labelled as \\"Lodge\\", a term often used at the time to refer to a very respectable villa type dwelling. but in 1829 an Act of Parliament was passed to permit the building of the Seven Sisters Road. Thomas Widdows was both the owner of the house and its occupant.Map showing the cottage in 1822 can be seen on Harringay Online at http://www.harringayonline.com/forum/topics/history-of-the-manor-house- pub?commentId=844301%3AComment%3A954164 With the building soon to be sited on the junction of the existing Green Lanes turnpike road and the new Seven Sisters Road, Widdows no doubt saw a roadside tavern as an excellent investment. The new building was within sight of the Hornsey Wood Tavern, which had been formed out of the old Copt Hall, the manor house of the Manor of Brownswood.See also Settlement section in History of Harringay Prehistory to 1750 It is possible that its name was taken from this connectionThis was certainly the belief of Edwardian author J. J. Sexby who wrote in his 1905 book, \\"In the neighbourhood of the (Finsbury) park we still have Brownswood Road and Manor-House Tavern to remind us of the Manor of Brownswood and of its manor-house, which has now disappeared\\" (The Municipal Gardens, and Open Spaces of London, Lieut. Col.J. J. Sexby, Elliot Stock 1905). The land itself however was on the demesne of Stoke Newington Manor.A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8, Islington and Stoke Newington Parishes, Victoria County History, London, 1985. Pages 143-151. At around the time that the pub was first built, on the southern boundary of the demesne, on Church Street, a school called Manor School was operatingA History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8, Islington and Stoke Newington Parishes, Victoria County History, London, 1985, Pages 217-223 The school was next door to the trading premises of Thomas Widdows, builder of the pub. So it is equally possible that the 'Manor House' name was just a fashionable name, more related to the connection with Stoke Newington Manor. Robert Baily, the first of many Manor House Tavern landlords described his establishment as a 'public house and tea- gardens'Morning Advertiser, 26 June 1837. He placed the following advertisement in the Morning Advertiser on 30 June 1834. Baily died just three years later. In 1838 the tavern was taken over by George Stacey who had previously been at the Adelaide Tavern in Hackney Roadin November 1839 various newspapers carried the announcement of the bankruptcy of William Tombleson described as \\"late of the Manor-house tavern, Stoke Newington, tavern-keeper, publisher, dealer and chapman\\" (Wiltshire Independent - 28 November 1839). So it may well be that Tombleson took over the pub after Baily but didn't last long. . The tavern changed hands again several times after Stacey.The Morning Advertiser of 31 July 1849 notes a change of licensee from Catherine Harris to William Burnell. Records also show a Michael Harris insured as a victualler at the tavern in 1840 (Nat Archives ref MS 11936/567/1323901); no doubt this is Catherine's husband. So it may well have been the Harrises who were running the pub at the time of the royal visit. On 25 October 1843 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert 'visited' the pub when they were travelling by carriage from Windsor to Cambridge. The route included the still relatively new Seven Sisters Road and a stop was made at the Manor House Tavern for the first change of horsesQueen Victoria's Journal in the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle, via www.armingford.net and William James Roe, Tottenham, Edmonton and Enfield Historical Notebook: With Some Incidental Notices of Harringay (or Hornsey), London 1952. A tablet with the following inscription was placed on the side of the pub. In 1851 it was purchased by James Toomer.Morning Advertiser, 9 August 1851, and Clerkenwell News, 10 July 1858 According to the Morning Post, Toomer was 'well respected in literary and theatrical circles'.The Morning Post - Saturday 31 May 1851 The new owner added function rooms including a banqueting hall and ballroom which became known as the Manor House Assembly Rooms. Soon after purchase he obtained licences for both music and dancing and the pub became a regular venue for events of both sorts.London Evening Standard, 6 October 1854 In the summer of 1870 Toomer advertised a new ballroomHackney and Kingsland Gazette, 4 June 1870 and later that summer sold the pub. The advertisement of sale gave the following description: The building was bought by John Charles Kay who sold it two years later to Samuel Perrin The Morning Advertiser of 2 July 1872. A further change of ownership in 1878 saw the pub in the hands of Stephen Medcalf. In 1879 Morris Benjamin made an application to renew the music and dancing licence as the licensee.Notice of Intention to Apply; an Application for Renewal of a Music and Dancing Licence from Morris Benjamin, Licensed Victualler, of The Manor House, Green Lanes, held at London Metropolitan Archives In 1890 it was taken on by James Swinyard who remodelled and modernised it shortly after the sale. Swinyard managed the pub till his death in 1910. Subsequently, his widow Amelia took over the licence until the late 1920s. In 1930 the imminent arrival of the Piccadilly Line led to the widening of the road, the demolition of the old tavern North London Recorder, 28 February 1930 and the erection of current building. Behind the new building, offices were built for London TransportAlthough the latter building still exists, Transport for London no longer occupies it. To the chagrin of her sons, Amelia Swinyard sold the pub to a buyer who then received the compensation when the pub's land was taken to accommodate these buildings. Amelia died in October 1937, aged 90 at the Kenwood Nursing Home in Muswell Hill. In later years the pub was the first employer of Richard Desmond, now the owner of the Daily Express and Daily Star. The building also housed a nightclubin a room on the first floor 'The Catacomb' nightclub accessed 14 April 2007 that was popular among Goths in the mid-1980s. Two decades earlier it had functioned as a popular music venue for rhythm and blues enthusiasts, called the Bluesville R.& B. Club, hosting artists such as Cream, Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, Long John Baldry and his Hoochie Coochie Men, Rod Stewart (then nicknamed 'Rod the Mod'), John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Fairport Convention, Fleetwood Mac, Jeff Beck, the Spencer Davis Group, Graham Bond and Zoot Money. The ground floor of the building is now occupied by Evergreen supermarket and Simply Organique cafe.  The Area in the twenty-first century Since 2007, the Woodberry Down estate has been undergoing a phased redevelopment that is seeing modern flats built on the site, many of which are for sale rather than for social rent.GLA press release 27 Jul 2001 accessed 14 April 2007 The plan was initially conceived during a time of economic growth under the New Labour administration in the late 1990s. In 2002, a structural assessment concluded that 54% (31 out of 57 existing buildings) were beyond economic repair. To progress the redevelopment, Hackney Council struck a deal with Genesis Housing Association and Berkeley Homes for the estate's demolition and redevelopment and urban regeneration project which has been amongst the largest in the UK. In 2018, construction of a Travelodge hotel commenced opposite the tube station. The first phase of the development produced 117 homes let by Genesis on social rents, and won the top prize for social housing at the Daily Telegraph British Homes Awards 2011.Genesis scoops top social housing prize at Daily Telegraph awards, 29 September 2011.

The snack was designed to be easily eaten on the move without a plate or cutlery. Since 1995 they have been owned by Simplot Australia. A Chiko Roll's filling is primarily cabbage and barley, as well as carrot, green beans, beef, beef tallow, wheat cereal, celery and onion. This filling is partially pulped and enclosed in a thick egg and flour pastry tube designed to survive handling at football matches. The roll is typically deep-fried in vegetable oil. At the peak of its popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, 40 million Chiko Rolls were sold annually in Australia. The product has been described as an Australian cultural icon.Chiko's search for roll model , news.com.au website.\\"Chiko Roll Nostalgia\\" , TV story from the Nine Network's A Current Affair news magazine program.McEncroe, Francis Gerard (Frank) ‚Äì David Dunstan, Australian Dictionary of Biography Online. Other products currently available under the Chiko brand include Corn Jacks, Hawaiian and Supreme pizza subs, Spudsters, onion rings, fish cakes and vegetable nuggets. History Development = The Chiko Roll was developed by Frank McEncroe, a boilermaker from Bendigo, Victoria, who turned to catering at football matches and other outdoor events. In 1950, McEncroe saw a competitor selling Chinese chop suey rolls outside the Richmond Cricket Ground and decided to add a similar product to his own line. McEncroe felt that the Chinese rolls were too flimsy to be easily handled in an informal outdoor setting and hit upon the idea of a much larger and more robust roll that would provide a quick meal that was both reasonably substantial and easily handled. The result was the Chiko Roll, which debuted at the Wagga Wagga Agriculture Show in 1951. = Popularity = In the 1960s, McEncroe moved to Melbourne with his family where he began to manufacture the rolls with the use of an adapted sausage machine. As the product became more popular, McEncroe moved his production to a larger factory in the suburb of Essendon. He later merged his business with a local company called Floyd's Iceworks to form Frozen Food Industries Pty Ltd. The new company went public in 1963. A Chiko Roll By 1965, most Australian takeaway restaurants, especially milk bars and fish and chip shops carried Chiko Rolls, with the marketing slogan \\"Grab a Chiko\\" signifying the ease with which shop owners could take a Chiko Roll from the freezer and put it into a fryer, usually add a sauce and slide it into its own trademarked bag. At the height of their popularity in the 1970s, 40 million Chiko Rolls were being sold Australia-wide each year and more than one million were exported to Japan. = Recent years = Since 1995, the Chiko brand has been owned by Simplot Australia. All Chiko Rolls are now manufactured in Bathurst, New South Wales, on a specifically designed machine that produces the pastry and filling at the same time in long rolls. They are then automatically sliced and then the distinctive ends are folded. Increasing competition in the Australian takeaway food market in recent decades has seen a decline in the profile of the Chiko Roll, with consumption down to 17 million per annum in 2011. However, they remain a popular snack at sporting events and are still widely available at fish and chip shops and supermarkets across Australia. In September 2016 a disagreement in the Parliament of New South Wales over the origins of the Chiko Roll occurred. The Nationals' Member for Calare Andrew Gee, Labor‚Äôs Member for Bendigo Lisa Chesters and Member for Riverina Michael McCormack all claimed the snack originated in their respective hometowns. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Chiko Roll the current manufacturer presented gold-plated replicas to Bendigo and Wagga Wagga cities. In October 2016 Karratha resident Mark Habermehl cooked a meat pie and a Chiko Roll on a barbeque in an attempt to avoid washing dishes. The event made the local newspaper and prompted a nomination for Australian of the Year, recognising the 'Australian-ness' of his choice of cuisine, selection of cooking device and ingenuity. Chiko Chick Since the 1950s, Chiko Rolls have been advertised featuring the \\"Chiko Chick\\" character, a seductive woman on a motorbike accompanied by the slogan \\"Couldn't you go a Chiko Roll?\\"Chiko still on a roll fifty years on , Simplot Australia website. During the early 1980s, the accompanying slogan \\"You can't knock the roll\\" was used. In 2008, the company began a nationwide search for the new \\"Chiko Chick\\", hoping to downplay the traditionally raunchy look in favour of a more wholesome \\"girl next door\\" image. On 17 July 2008, the new advertising poster was unveiled at the Wagga Wagga Showgrounds featuring Annette Melton as the new face.

Popularly called \\"Rupashi Banglar Kabi (Poet of Beautiful Bengal), Das is the most read poet after Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam in Bangladesh and West Bengal. While not particularly recognised initially, today Das is acknowledged as one of the greatest poets in the Bengali language. Born in Barishal to a Vaidya- Brahmo family, Das studied English literature at Presidency College, Kolkata and earned his MA from Calcutta University. He had a troubling career and suffered financial hardship throughout his life. He taught at many colleges but was never granted tenure. He settled in Kolkata after the partition of India. Das died on 22 October 1954, eight days after being hit by a tramcar. The witnesses said that though the tramcar whistled, he did not stop, and got struck. Some deem the accident as an attempt at suicide. Jibanananda Das was very underrated poet in his time; he wrote profusely, but as he was a recluse and introvert, he did not publish most of his writings during his lifetime. Most of his work were hidden, and only seven volumes of his poems were published. After his death, it was discovered that apart from poems, Das wrote 21 novels and 108 short stories. His notable works include Ruposhi Bangla, Banalata Sen, Mahaprithibi, Shreshtha Kavita. Das's early poems exhibit the influence of Kazi Nazrul Islam, but in the latter half of the 20th century, Das's influence became one of the major catalysts in the making of Bengali poetry. Das received Rabindra-Memorial Award for Banalata Sen in 1953 at All Bengal Rabindra Literature Convention. Das's Shrestha Kavita won the Sahitya Academy Award in 1955. BiographyEarly life= Young Jibanananda Das Jibanananda Das was born in 1899 in a Baidya family in the small district town of Barisal. His ancestors came from the Bikrampur region of Dhaka district, from a now-extinct village called Gaupara on the banks of the river Padma. Jibanananda's grandfather SarbƒÅnanda DƒÅ≈õagupta was the first to settle permanently in Barisal. He was an early exponent of the reformist Brahmo Samaj movement in Barisal and was highly regarded in town for his philanthropy. He erased the -gupta suffix from the family name, regarding it as a symbol of Vedic Brahmin excess, thus rendering the surname to Das. Jibanananda's father SatyƒÅnanda DƒÅ≈õ (1863‚Äì1942) was a schoolmaster, essayist, magazine publisher, and founder-editor of Br√¥hmobadi, a journal of the Brahmo Samaj dedicated to the exploration of social issues. Jibanananda's mother KusumakumƒÅrƒ´ DƒÅ≈õ was a poet who wrote a famous poem called Ad√¥rsho Chhƒìlƒì (\\"The Ideal Boy\\") whose refrain is well known to Bengalis to this day: ƒÄmƒÅdƒìr dƒìshey hobey shei chhƒìlƒì kobey / Kothae nƒÅ bo·πõo hoye kajey boro hobey. (The child who achieves not in words but in deeds, when will this land know such a one?) Jibanananda was the eldest son of his parents, and was called by the nickname Milu. A younger brother A≈õ≈çkƒÅnanda DƒÅ≈õ was born in 1908 and a sister called ShuchoritƒÅ in 1915. Milu fell violently ill in his childhood, and his parents feared for his life. Fervently desiring to restore his health, Kusumkumari took her ailing child on pilgrimage to Lucknow, Agra and Giridih. They were accompanied on these journeys by their uncle ChandranƒÅth. In January 1908, Milu, by now eight years old, was admitted to the first grade in Brojomohon School. The delay was due to his father's opposition to admitting children into school at too early an age. Milu's childhood education was therefore limited to his mother's tutelage. His school life passed by relatively uneventfully. In 1915 he successfully completed his matriculation examination from Brajamohan College, obtaining a first division in the process. He repeated the feat two years later when he passed the intermediate exams from Brajamohan College. Evidently an accomplished student, he left his home at rural Barisal to join University of Calcutta. = Life in Calcutta: first phase = Jibanananda enrolled in Presidency College, Kolkata. He studied English literature and graduated with a BA (Honours) degree in 1919. That same year, his first poem appeared in print in the Boishakh issue of Brahmobadi journal. Fittingly, the poem was called Borsho-abahon (Arrival of the New Year). This poem was published anonymously, with only the honorific Sri in the byline. However, the annual index in the year-end issue of the magazine revealed his full name: \\"Sri Jibanananda Das Gupta, BA\\". In 1921, he completed the MA degree in English from University of kolkata, obtaining a second class. He was also studying law. At this time, he lived in the Hardinge student quarters next to the university. Just before his exams, he fell ill with bacillary dysentery, which affected his preparation for the examination. The following year, he started his teaching career. He joined the English department of City College, Calcutta as a tutor. By this time, he had left Hardinge and was boarding at Harrison Road. He gave up his law studies. It is thought that he also lived in a house in Bechu Chatterjee Street for some time with his brother Ashokanananda, who had come there from Barisal for his MSc studies. = Travels and travails = His literary career was starting to take off. When Deshbondhu Chittaranjan Das died in June 1925, Jibanananda wrote a poem called 'Deshbandhu' Prayan'e' (\\"On the Death of the Friend of the nation\\") which was published in Bangabani magazine. This poem would later take its place in the collection called Jhara Palok (1927). On reading it, poet Kalidas Roy said that he had thought the poem was the work of a mature, accomplished poet hiding behind a pseudonym. Jibanananda's earliest printed prose work was also published in 1925. This was an obituary entitled \\"Kalimohan Das'er Sraddha- bashorey,\\" which appeared in serialised form in Brahmobadi magazine. His poetry began to be widely published in various literary journals and little magazines in Calcutta, Dhaka and elsewhere. These included Kallol, perhaps the most famous literary magazine of the era, Kalikalam (Pen and Ink), Progoti (Progress) (co-edited by Buddhadeb Bose) and others. At this time, he occasionally used the surname Dasgupta as opposed to Das. In 1927, Jhara Palok (Fallen Feathers), his first collection of poems, came out. A few months later, Jibanananda was fired from his job at the City College. The college had been struck by student unrest surrounding a religious festival, and enrolment seriously suffered as a consequence. Still in his late 20s, Jibanananda was the youngest member of the faculty and therefore regarded as the most dispensable. In the literary circle of Calcutta, he also came under serial attack. One of the most serious literary critics of that time, Sajanikanta Das, began to write aggressive critiques of his poetry in the review pages of Shanibarer Chithi (the Saturday Letter) magazine. With nothing to keep him in Calcutta, Jibanananda left for the small town of Bagerhat in the far south, there to resume his teaching career at Bagerhat P. C. College. But after about three months he returned to the big city, now in dire financial straits. To make ends meet, he gave private tuition to students while applying for full- time positions in academia. In December 1929, he moved to Delhi to take up a teaching post at Ramjas College; again this lasted no more than a few months. Back in Barisal, his family had been making arrangements for his marriage. Once Jibanananda went to Barisal, he failed to go back to Delhi ‚Äì and, consequently, lost the job. In May 1930, he married Labanyaprabhai Das, a girl whose ancestors came from Khulna. At the subsequent reception in Dhaka's Ram Mohan Library, leading literary lights of the day such as Ajit Kumar Dutta and Buddhadeb Bose were assembled. A daughter called Manjusree was born to the couple in February of the following year. Around this time, he wrote one of his most controversial poems. \\"Camp'e\\" (At the Camp) was printed in Sudhindranath Dutta's Parichay magazine and immediately caused a firestorm in the literary circle of Calcutta. The poem's ostensible subject is a deer hunt on a moonlit night. Many accused Jibanananda of promoting indecency and incest through this poem. More and more, he turned now, in secrecy, to fiction. He wrote a number of short novels and short stories during this period of unemployment, strife and frustration. In 1934 he wrote the series of poems that would form the basis of the collection called Rupasi Bangla. These poems were not discovered during his lifetime, and were only published in 1957, three years after his death. = Back in Barisal = In 1935, Jibanananda, by now familiar with professional disappointment and poverty, returned to his alma mater Brajamohan College, which was then affiliated with the University of Calcutta. He joined as a lecturer in the English department. In Calcutta, Buddhadeb Bose, Premendra Mitra and Samar Sen were starting a brand new poetry magazine called Kobita. Jibanananda's work featured in the very first issue of the magazine, a poem called Mrittu'r Aagey (Before Death). Upon reading the magazine, Tagore wrote a lengthy letter to Bose and especially commended the Das poem: \\"Jibanananda Das' vivid, colourful poem has given me great pleasure.\\" It was in the second issue of Kobita (Poush 1342 issue, Dec 1934/Jan 1935) that Jibanananda published his now-legendary \\"Banalata Sen\\". Today, this 18-line poem is among the most famous poems in the language. The following year, his second volume of poetry Dhusar Pandulipi was published. Jibanananda was by now well settled in Barisal. A son Samarananda was born in November 1936. His impact in the world of Bengali literature continued to increase. In 1938, Tagore compiled a poetry anthology entitled Bangla Kabya Parichay (Introduction to Bengali Poetry) and included an abridged version of Mrityu'r Aagey, the same poem that had moved him three years ago. Another important anthology came out in 1939, edited by Abu Sayeed Ayub and Hirendranath Mukhopadhyay; Jibanananda was represented with four poems: Pakhira, Shakun, Banalata Sen, and Nagna Nirjan Haat. In 1942, the same year that his father died, his third volume of poetry Banalata Sen was published under the aegis of Kobita Bhavan and Buddhadeb Bose. A ground-breaking modernist poet in his own right, Bose was a steadfast champion of Jibanananda's poetry, providing him with numerous platforms for publication. 1944 saw the publication of Maha Prithibi. The Second World War had a profound impact on Jibanananda's poetic vision. The following year, Jibanananda provided his own translations of several of his poems for an English anthology to be published under the title Modern Bengali Poems. Oddly enough, the editor Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya considered these translations to be sub-standard, and instead commissioned Martin Kirkman to translate four of Jibanananda's poems for the book. = Life in Calcutta: final phase = The aftermath of the war saw heightened demands for Indian independence. Muslim politicians led by Jinnah wanted an independent homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent. Bengal was uniquely vulnerable to partition: its western half was majority- Hindu, its eastern half majority-Muslim. Yet adherents of both religions spoke the same language, came from the same ethnic stock, and lived in close proximity to each other in town and village. Jibanananda had emphasized the need for communal harmony at an early stage. In his very first book Jhora Palok, he had included a poem called Hindu Musalman. In it he proclaimed:However, events in real life belied his beliefs. In the summer of 1946, he travelled to Calcutta from Barisal on three months' paid leave. He stayed at his brother Ashokananda's place through the bloody riots that swept the city. Violence broke out in Noakhali and Tippera districts later in the autumn, and he was unable to return to Barisal. Just before partition in August 1947, Jibanananda quit his job at Brajamohan College and said goodbye to his beloved Barisal. He and his family were among the 10 million refugees who took part in the largest cross-border migration in history. For a while he worked for a magazine called Swaraj as its Sunday editor. However, he left the job after a few months. In 1948, he completed two of his novels, Mallyaban and Shutirtho, neither of which were discovered during his life. Shaat'ti Tarar Timir was published in December 1948. The same month, his mother Kusumkumari Das died in Calcutta. By now, he was well established in the Calcutta literary world. He was appointed to the editorial board of yet another new literary magazine Dondo (Conflict). However, in a reprise of his early career, he was sacked from his job at Kharagpur College in February 1951. In 1952, Signet Press published Banalata Sen. The book received widespread acclaim and won the Book of the Year award from the All-Bengal Tagore Literary Conference. Later that year, the poet found another job at Barisha College (now known as Vivekananda College, Thakurpukur). This job too he lost within a few months. He applied afresh to Diamond Harbour Fakirchand College, but eventually declined it, owing to travel difficulties. Instead he was obliged to take up a post at Howrah Girl's College (now known as Bijoy Krishna Girls' College), a constituent affiliated undergraduate college of the University of Calcutta. As the head of the English department, he was entitled to a 50-taka monthly bonus on top of his salary. By the last year of his life, Jibanananda was acclaimed as one of the best poets of the post-Tagore era. He was constantly in demand at literary conferences, poetry readings, radio recitals etc. In May 1954, he was published a volume titled 'Best Poems' (Sreshttho Kobita). His Best Poems won the Indian Sahitya Akademi Award in 1955. =Love and marriage= Young Jibanananda fell in love with Shovona, daughter of his uncle Atulchandra Das, who lived in the neighbourhood. He dedicated his first anthology of poems to Shovona without mentioning her name explicitly. He did not try to marry her since marriage between cousins was not socially acceptable. She has been referred to as Y in his literary notes. Soon after marrying Labanyaprabha Das (n√©e Gupta) in 1930, a personality clash erupted and Jibanananda Das gave up the hope of a happy married life. The gap with his wife never narrowed. While Jibanananda was near death after a tram accident on 14 October 1954, Labanyaprabha did not visit her husband on his deathbed more than once. At that time she was busy in film-making in Tallyganj. = Death = On 14 October 1954, he was crossing a road near Calcutta's Deshapriya Park when he was hit by a tram. Jibanananda was returning home after his routine evening walk. At that time, he used to reside in a rented apartment on the Lansdowne Road. Seriously injured, he was taken to Shambhunath Pundit Hospital. Poet- writer Sajanikanta Das who had been one of his fiercest critics was tireless in his efforts to secure the best treatment for the poet. He even persuaded Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy (then chief minister of West Bengal) to visit him in hospital. Nonetheless, the injury was too severe to redress. Jibanananda died in hospital on 22 October 1954 eight days later, at about midnight. He was then 55 and left behind his wife, Labanyaprabha Das, a son and a daughter, and the ever-growing band of readers. His body was cremated the following day at Keoratola crematorium. Following popular belief, it has been alleged in some biographical accounts that his accident was actually an attempt at suicide.‡¶Ü‡¶ß‡ßÅ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ô‡¶≤‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶§‡¶æ [Modern Bengali Poetry], ed. Humayun Azad, . Although none of the Jibanananda biographers have indicated such, it appears from circumstantial evidence that it was an attempt to end his own life.Discussion with Dr. Bhumendra Guha in February 2006 The literary circle deeply mourned his death. Almost all the newspapers published obituaries which contained sincere appreciations of the poetry of Jibanananda. Poet Sanjay Bhattacharya wrote the death news and sent to different newspapers. On 1 November 1954, The Times of India wrote: > The premature death after an accident of Mr. Jibanananda Das removes from > the field of Bengali literature a poet, who, though never in the limelight > of publicity and prosperity, made a significant contribution to modern > Bengali poetry by his prose-poems and free-verse. ... A poet of nature with > a serious awareness of the life around him Jibanananda Das was known not so > much for the social content of his poetry as for his bold imagination and > the concreteness of his image. To a literary world dazzled by Tagore's > glory, Das showed how to remain true to the poet's vocation without basking > in its reflection.\\" In his obituary in the Shanibarer Chithi, Sajanikanta Das quoted the poet: > When one day I‚Äôll leave this body once for all ‚àí > Shall I never return to this world any more? > Let me come back > On a winter night > To the bedside of any dying acquaintance > With a cold pale lump of orange in hand. > Jibanananda and Bengali poetryInfluence of Tagore= As of 2009, Bengali is the mother tongue of more than 300 million people living mainly in Bangladesh and India. Bengali poetry of the modern age flourished on the elaborate foundation laid by Michael Madhusudan Dutt (1824‚Äì1873) and Rabindranath Tagore (1861‚Äì1941). Tagore ruled over the domain of Bengali poetry and literature for almost half a century, inescapably influencing contemporary poets. Bengali literature caught the attention of the international literary world when Tagore was awarded the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature for Gitanjali, an anthology of poems rendered into English by the poet himself with the title Song Offering. Since then Bengali poetry has travelled a long way. It has evolved around its own tradition; it has responded to the poetry movements around the world; it has assumed various dimensions in different tones, colours and essence.Beyond Land and Time, ed. Faizul Latif Chowdhury and Golam Mustafa, 2008, Somoy Prokashon, Dhaka =Contemporaries of Jibanananda= In Bengal, efforts to break out of the Tagorian worldview and stylistics started in the early days of the 20th century. Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam (1899‚Äì1976) popularised himself on a wide scale with patriotic themes and musical tone and tenor. However, a number of new -ration poets consciously attempted to align Bengali poetry with the essence of worldwide emergent modernism, starting towards the end of the 19th century and attributeable to contemporary European and American trends. Five poets who are particularly acclaimed for their contribution in creating a post-Tagorian poetic paradigm and infusing modernism in Bengali poetry are Sudhindranath Dutta (1901‚Äì1960), Buddhadeb Bose (1908‚Äì1974), Amiya Chakravarty (1901‚Äì1986), Jibanananda Das (1899‚Äì1954) and Bishnu Dey (1909‚Äì1982). The contour of modernism in 20th-century Bengali poetry was drawn by these five pioneers and some of their contemporaries. However, not all of them have survived the test of time. Of them, poet Jibanananda Das was little understood during his lifetime. In fact, he received scanty attention and some considered him incomprehensible. Readers, including his contemporary literary critics, also alleged faults in his style and diction. On occasions, he faced merciless criticism from leading literary personalities of his time. Even Tagore made unkind remarks on his diction, although he praised his poetic capability. Nevertheless, destiny reserved a crown for him. =Growth of popularity= During the later half of the twentieth century, Jibanananda Das emerged as one of the most popular poets of modern Bengali literature. Popularity apart, Jibanananda Das had distinguished himself as an extraordinary poet presenting a paradigm hitherto unknown. Whilst his unfamiliar poetic diction, choice of words and thematic preferences took time to reach the hearts of readers, by the end of the 20th century the poetry of Jibanananda had become a defining essence of modernism in 20th-century Bengali poetry. Whilst his early poems bear the undoubted influence of Kazi Nazrul Islam and other poets like Satyendranath Dutta, before long Jibananda had thoroughly overcame these influences and created a new poetic diction. Buddhadeb Bose was among the first to recognise his style and thematic novelty. However, as his style and diction matured, his message appeared obscured. Readers, including critics, started to complain about readability and question his sensibility. Only after his accidental death in 1954 did a readership emerge that not only was comfortable with Jibanananda's style and diction but also enjoyed his poetry. Questions about the obscurity of his poetic message were no longer raised. By the time his birth centenary was celebrated in 1999, Jibanananda Das was the most popular and well-read poet of Bengali literature. Even when the last quarter of the 20th century ushered in the post-modern era, Jibanananda Das continued to be relevant to the new taste and fervour. This was possible because his poetry underwent many cycles of change, and later poems contain post-modern elements. Poetics Jibanananda Das started writing and publishing in his early 20s. During his lifetime he published only 269 poems in different journals and magazines, of which 162 were collected in seven anthologies, from Jhara Palak to Bela Obela Kalbela.Chowdhury, Faizul Latif (editor) (1995), I have seen the Bengal's face ‚Äì Poems from Jibanananda Das, Creative Workshop, Chittagong (A collection of forty poems by Jibanananda Das, rendered into English by different translators). Many of his poems have been published posthumously at the initiative of his brother Asokananda Das, sister Sucharita Das and nephew Amitananda Das, and the efforts of Dr. Bhumendra Guha, who over the decades copied them from scattered manuscripts. By 2008, the total count of Jibananda's known poems stood at almost 800. In addition, numerous novels and short stories were discovered and published about the same time. Jibanananda scholar Clinton B. Seely has termed Jibanananda Das as \\"Bengal's most cherished poet since Rabindranath Tagore\\". On the other hand, to many, reading the poetry of Jibanananda Das is like stumbling upon a labyrinth of the mind similar to what one imagines Camus's 'absurd' man toiling through. Indeed, Jibanananda Das's poetry is sometimes an outcome of profound feeling painted in imagery of a type not readily understandable. Sometimes the connection between the sequential lines is not obvious. In fact, Jibanananda Das broke the traditional circular structure of poetry (introduction-middle-end) and the pattern of logical sequence of words, lines and stanzas. Consequently, the thematic connotation is often hidden under a rhythmic narrative that requires careful reading between the lines. The following excerpt will bear the point out: > Lepers open the hydrant and lap some water. > Or maybe that hydrant was already broken. > Now at midnight they descend upon the city in droves, > Scattering sloshing petrol. Though ever careful, > Someone seems to have taken a serious spill in the water. > Three rickshaws trot off, fading into the last gaslight. > I turn off, leave Phear Lane, defiantly > Walk for miles, stop beside a wall > On Bentinck Street, at Territti Bazar, > There in the air dry as roasted peanuts. > (Night ‚Äì a poem on night in Calcutta, translated by Clinton B. Seely) > Though Jibanananda Das was variously branded at times and was popularly known as a modernist of the Yeatsian-Poundian-Eliotesque school, Annadashankar Roy called him the truest poet. Jibanananda Das conceived a poem and moulded it up in the way most natural for him. When a theme occurred to him, he shaped it with words, metaphors and imagery that distinguished him from all others. Jibanananda Das's poetry is to be felt, rather than merely read or heard. Writing about Jibanananda Das' poetry, Joe Winter remarked: > It is a natural process, though perhaps the rarest one. Jibanananda Das's > style reminds us of this, seeming to come unbidden. It has many sentences > that scarcely pause for breath, of word-combinations that seem altogether > unlikely but work, of switches in register from sophisticated usage to a > village-dialect word, that jar and in the same instant settle in the mind, > full of friction ‚Äì in short, that almost becomes a part of the consciousness > ticking.Winter, Joe: Jibanananda Das ‚Äì Naked Lonely Hand (Selected poems > translated from Bengali), 2003, Anvil Press Poetry, London. A few lines are quoted below in support of Winter's remarks: > Nevertheless, the owl stays wide awake; > The rotten, still frog begs two more moments > in the hope of another dawn in conceivable warmth. > We feel in the deep tracelessness of flocking darkness > the unforgiving enmity of the mosquito-net all around; > The mosquito loves the stream of life, > awake in its monastery of darkness. > (One day eight years ago, translated by Faizul Latif Chowdhury) > Or elsewhere: > ... how the wheel of justice is set in motion > by a smidgen of wind - > or if someone dies and someone else gives him a bottle > of medicine, free ‚Äì then who has the profit? - > over all of this the four have a mighty word-battle. > For the land they will go to now is called the soaring river > where a wretched bone-picker and his bone > come and discover > their faces in water ‚Äì till looking at faces is over. > (Idle Moment, translated by Joe Winter) > Also noteworthy are his sonnets, the most famous being seven untitled pieces collected in the publication Shaat-ti Tarar Timir (\\"The Blackness of Seven Stars), where he describes, on one hand, his attachment to his motherland, and on the other, his views about life and death in general. They are noteworthy not only because of the picturesque description of nature that was a regular feature of most of his work but also for the use of metaphors and allegories. For example, a lone owl flying about in the night sky is taken as an omen of death, while the anklets on the feet of a swan symbolises the vivacity of life. The following are undoubtedly the most oft-quoted line from this collection: ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶ñ ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶ñ‡¶ø‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶õ‡¶ø, ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡ßÇ‡¶™ ‡¶ñ‡ßÅ‡¶Å‡¶ú‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶®‡¶æ ‡¶Ü‡¶∞... Jibanananda successfully integrated Bengali poetry with the slightly older Eurocentric international modernist movement of the early 20th century. In this regard he possibly owes as much to his exotic exposure as to his innate poetic talent. Although hardly appreciated during his lifetime, many critics believe that his modernism, evoking almost all the suggested elements of the phenomenon, remains untranscended to date, despite the emergence of many notable poets during the last 50 years. His success as a modern Bengali poet may be attributed to the facts that Jibanananda Das in his poetry not only discovered the tract of the slowly evolving 20th-century modern mind, sensitive and reactive, full of anxiety and tension, bu that he invented his own diction, rhythm and vocabulary, with an unmistakably indigenous rooting, and that he maintained a self-styled lyricism and imagism mixed with an extraordinary existentialist sensuousness, perfectly suited to the modern temperament in the Indian context, whereby he also averted fatal dehumanisation that could have alienated him from the people. He was at once a classicist and a romantic and created an appealing world hitherto unknown: Banalata Sens Cover by Satyajit Ray. > For thousands of years I roamed the paths of this earth, > From waters round Ceylon in dead of night > to Malayan seas. > Much have I wandered. I was there > in the grey world of Asoka > And Bimbisara, pressed on through darkness > to the city of Vidarbha. > I am a weary heart surrounded by life's frothy ocean. > To me she gave a moment's peace ‚Äì > Banalata Sen from Natore. > (Banalata Sen) While reading Jibanananda Das, one often encounters references to olden times and places, events and personalities. A sense of time and history is an unmistakable element that has shaped Jibanananda Das's poetic world to a great extent. However, he lost sight of nothing surrounding him. Unlike many of his peers who blindly imitated the renowned western poets in a bid to create a new poetic domain and generated spurious poetry, Jibanananda Das remained anchored in his own soil and time, successfully assimilating experiences real and virtual and producing hundreds of unforgettable lines. His intellectual vision was thoroughly embedded in Bengal's nature and beauty: > Amidst a vast meadow the last time when I met her > I said: 'Come again a time like this > if one day you so wish > twenty-five years later.' > This been said, I came back home. > After that, many a time, the moon and the stars > from field to field have died, the owls and the rats > searching grains in paddy fields on a moonlit night > fluttered and crept! ‚Äì shut eyed > many times left and right > have slept > several souls! ‚Äì awake kept I > all alone ‚Äì the stars on the sky > travel fast > faster still, time speeds by. > Yet it seems > Twenty-five years will forever last. > (After Twenty-five Years, translated by Luna Rushdi) ‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂‡¶≤‡ßÄ‡¶®‡¶æ ‚Äì ‡¶ú‡ßÄ‡¶¨‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶ ‡¶¶‡¶æ‡¶∂ ‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡¶û‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶®‡¶æ, ‡¶Ö‡¶á‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßã‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßã ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø, ‡¶¨‡ßã‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßã ‡¶ï‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶Ö‡¶á ‡¶Ø‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶•‡ßá; ‡¶´‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶∏‡ßã ‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡¶û‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶®‡¶æ : ‡¶®‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶ø ‡¶Ü‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶® ‡¶≠‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶§‡ßá; ‡¶´‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶∏‡ßã ‡¶è‡¶á ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶†‡ßá, ‡¶¢‡ßá‡¶â‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá; ‡¶´‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶∏‡ßã ‡¶π‡ßÉ‡¶¶‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞; ‡¶¶‡ßÇ‡¶∞ ‡¶•‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¶‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡ßá ‚Äì ‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡¶ì ‡¶¶‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶•‡ßá ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßã‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßã ‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡•§ ‡¶ï‡ßÄ ‡¶ï‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶•‡ßá? ‚Äì ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶•‡ßá! ‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Ü‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂‡ßá ‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶§‡ßã ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶Ü‡¶ú : ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶Æ ‡¶ò‡¶æ‡¶∏ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶∏‡ßá‡•§ ‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡¶û‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶®‡¶æ, ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶π‡ßÉ‡¶¶‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶Ü‡¶ú ‡¶ò‡¶æ‡¶∏ : ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ì‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∏ ‚Äì ‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ì‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂‡•§ Thematically, Jibanananda Das is amazed by the continued existence of humankind in the backdrop of eternal flux of time, wherein individual presence is insignificant and meteoric albeit inescapable. He feels that we are closed in, fouled by the numbness of this concentration cell (Meditations). To him, the world is weird and olden, and as a race, mankind has been a persistent \\"wanderer of this world\\" (Banalata Sen) that, according to him, has existed too long to know anything more (Before death, Walking alone) or experience anything fresh. The justification of further mechanical existence like Mahin's horses (The Horses) is apparently absent: \\"So (he) had slept by the Dhanshiri river on a cold December night, and had never thought of waking again\\" (Darkness). As an individual, tired of life and yearning for sleep (One day eight years ago), Jibanananda Das is certain that peace can be found nowhere and that it is useless to move to a distant land, since there is no way of freedom from sorrows fixed by life (Land, Time and Offspring). Nevertheless, he suggests: \\"O sailor, you press on, keep pace with the sun!\\" (Sailor).Chowdhury, Faizul Latif (editor) (1995), I have seen the Bengal's face ‚Äì Poems from Jibanananda Das, Creative Workshop, Chittagong (A collection of forty poems by Jibanananda Das rendered into English by different translators) Why did Jibanananda task himself to forge a new poetic speech, while others in his time preferred to tread the usual path? The answer is simple. In his endeavours to shape a world of his own, he was gradual and steady. He was an inward-looking person and was not in a hurry. > I do not want to go anywhere so fast. > Whatever my life wants I have time to reach > there walking > (Of 1934 ‚Äì a poem on the motor car, translated by Golam Mustafa) > In the poet's birth centenary, Bibhav published 40 of his poems that had been yet unpublished.

Much literary evaluation of his poetry has been produced since Jibanananda Das's untimely death, beginning with the ten-page Introduction of Naked Lonely Hand, an anthology of 50 of the poet's poems rendered into English.Winter, Joe, Jibanananda Das ‚Äì Naked Lonely Hand ( 2003), Anvil Press Poetry, London Winter appears to have caught the essence of the poet, who appeared to be subtle, mysterious and bizarre even to native readers and critics of his time. He was also known as a surrealist poet for his spontaneous, frenzied overflow of subconscious mind in poetry and especially in diction. = Prose style = During his lifetime Jibanananda remained solely a poet who occasionally wrote literary articles, mostly on request. Only after his death were a huge number of novels and short stories discovered. Thematically, Jibanananda's storylines are largely autobiographical. His own time constitutes the perspective. While in poetry he subdued his own life, he allowed it to be brought into his fiction. Structurally his fictional works are based more on dialogues than description by the author. However, his prose shows a unique style of compound sentences, use of non-colloquial words and a typical pattern of punctuation. His essays evidence a heavy prose style, which although complex, is capable of expressing complicated analytical statements.

Jibanananda in English translation  Translating Jibanananda Das (JD) poses a real challenge to any translator. It not only requires translation of words and phrases, it demands 'translation' of colour and music, of imagination and images. Translations are a works of interpretation and reconstruction. When it comes to JD, both are quite difficult. However people have shown enormous enthusiasm in translating JD. Translation of JD commenced as the poet himself rendered some of his poetry into English at the request of poet Buddhadeb Bose for the Kavita. That was 1952. His translations include Banalata Sen, Meditations, Darkness, Cat and Sailor among others, many of which are now lost. Since then many JD lovers have taken interest in translating JD's poetry into English. These have been published, home and abroad, in different anthologies and magazines. Obviously different translators have approached their task from different perspectives. Some intended to merely transliterate the poem while others wanted to maintain the characteristic tone of Jibanananda as much as possible. As indicated above, the latter is not an easy task. In this connection, it is interesting to quote Chidananda Dasgupta who informed of his experience in translating JD: > Effort has of course been made to see that the original's obliqueness or > deliberate suppression of logical and syntactical links are not removed > altogether. Sometimes Jibanananda's very complicated and apparently > arbitrary syntax has been smoothed out to a clear flow. On occasion, a word > or even a line has been dropped, and its intention incorporated somewhere > just before or after. Names of trees, plants, places or other elements > incomprehensible in English have often been reduced or eliminated for fear > that they should become an unpleasant burden on the poem when read in > translation.Dashgupta, Chidananda : 'Selected Poems ‚Äì Jibanananda Das', > 2006, Penguin Books, New Delhi. Small wonder that Chidananda Dasgupta took quite a bit of liberty in his project of translating JD.

He gave birth to a completely new kind of language. In this context all of his anthologies are important. But, I like most 'Dhusar Pandulipi', 'Rupasi Bangla', 'Bela Abela Kalbela'...all of them are good. Actually in good poetry, the mind is transformed...Actually, the life of poet cohabits both solitude and ambition. So was Jibananda's...it is difficult to defy and condradict the revered poets of the world. Jibananda, is one such revered poets.\\"‚ÄîBinoy Majumdar. \\" In the Post-Tagore era, Jibanananda was the most successful in creating a ring of poetry of uniqueness.\\" ‚Äì Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee \\" Whenever I started reading Jibanananda, I found known poems in a new light.\\" ‚Äì Joy Goswami. \\" Death has never been a unidimensional concept in Jibanananda's poetry. It has multiple meanings, multiple scopes.\\"‚ÄîPabitra Sarkar. \\" Pure and layered symbol is the speciality of Jibanananda's poetry. By exploring the unnamed expressions of the poetry, readers get bewitched into the symbols, images.\\"‚ÄîDilip Jhaveri \\" Postmodernism in Bengali poetry started with Jibanananda Das's poem Paradigm. \\" Malay Roy Choudhury =Quotation= \\" Calcutta, with all its blemishes and bad names, is, after all, even in its odd architectural medley not so graceless as many strangers and Indians are disposed to think of it.\\" \\" Despite important differences, Calcutta seemed as its intricate map of body and mind would be laid open to bear a rather near resemblance to Paris.\\" \\" A mature artist...does not propose to evade the riddles around him. He takes stock of the significant directions and the purposes of his age and of their more clear and concrete embodiments in the men of his age. He arrives at his own philosophy and builds his own world, which is never a negation of the actual one, but is the same living world organized more truly and proportionately by the special reading of it by the special poet.\\" \\" Garnered so much of experience when I reached Calucutta; got several possibilities regarding literary, trade etc.\\" \\" There were so many myths regarding my elder brother. He escaped from life. He could not tolerate human company. He was solitary. Away from the all hustle-bustle...may be most of them have already proved wrong.\\"‚ÄîSucahrita Das on her elder brother, the poet. \\" Among our modernist poets, Jibanananda is the most solitary, most independent.\\"‚ÄîBuddhadeb Basu =Books on Jibanananda= * (1965) 'Ekti Nakkhatro Ase', Ambuj Basu, Mousumi. * (1970) 'Kobi Jibanananda Das', Sanjay Bhattacharya, Varbi. * (1971) 'Jibanananda(ek khando)', Gopal Chandra Roy, Sahittya Sadan;'Mauns Jibanananda', Labanya Das, Bengal Publishers; 'Jibanananda Sriti', Debkumar Basu edited, Karuna Prokasani. * (1972) 'Suddhatamo Kobi', Abdul Mannan Saiyad, Knowledge Home, Dhaka; 'Rupasi Banglar Kobi Jibanananda', Bijan Kanti Sarkar, Bijoy Sahitya Mandir; 'Rupasi Banglar Kobi Jibanananda', Shaymapada Sarkar, Kamini Prokasan. * (1973) 'Jibanananda das', edited by Birendra Bhattacharya, Onnisto. * (1975) 'Kobi Jibanananda', Suddhaswatto Basu, Sankha Prokasan. * (1976) 'Jibanishilpi Jibanananda Das', Asadujjan, Bangladesh Book Corporation, Dhaka. * (1979) 'Rupasi Banglar Kobi Jibanananda', Bijan Kanti Sarkar, Bijoy Sahitya Mandir; 'Rupasi Banglar Kobi Jibanananda', Shyamapada Sarkar, Kamini Prokashan. * (1980) 'Rupasi Banglar Dui Kobi', Purnendu Patri, Ananda Publishers Ltd. * (1983) 'Kacher Manus Jibanananda', Ajit Ghose, Bijoy Krishna Girls‚Äô College Cheap Store;'Rabindranath Najrul Jibanananda ebong aekjon Probasi Bangali', Kalyan Kumar Basu, Biswagaen;'Adhunikata, Jibanananda o Porabastob', Tapodhir Bhattacharya and Swapna Bhattacharya, Nobark;'Jibananander Chetona Jagot', Pradumno Mitra, Sahityshri;'Jibanananda Das:Jiboniponji o Granthoponji', Provat Kumar Das, Hardo;'Prosongo:Jibanananda', Shibaji Bandopadhaya, Ayon. * (1984) 'Jibanananda', Amalendu Basu, Banishilpo,;'Uttor Probesh', Susnato Jana;'Jibanananda', edited by Abdul Manna Sayad, Charitra, Dhaka;'Jibanananda Prasongiki', Sandip Datta, Hardo, * (1985) 'Ami sei Purohit', Sucheta Mitra, A.Mukherji and Co;'Probondhokar Jibananada', Subrata Rudro, Nath Publishing;'Jibanananda Jiggasa', edited by Tarun Mukhopadhaya, pustok Biponi. * (2003) 'Jibananda : Kabitar Mukhamukhi', Narayan Haldar. * (2005) 'Amar Jibanananda', Dr. Himabanta Bondopadhyay, Bangiya Sahitya Samsad. * (2009) 'Etodin Kothay Chilen', Anisul Hoque. * (2014) 'Jibananander Andhokaare', Rajib Sinha, Ubudash, Kolkata-12.

It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac, which is made only from ugni blanc grapes. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit√© (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA). Armagnac was one of the first areas in France to begin distilling spirits, but the overall volume of production is far smaller than cognac production and therefore is less known outside Europe. In addition, it is for the most part made and sold by small producers, whereas cognac production is dominated by big-name brands, especially Courvoisier (owned by Beam Suntory), Hennessy (LVMH), Martell (Pernod Ricard), and R√©my Martin (R√©my Cointreau). History and cultural uses Armagnac is the oldest brandy distilled in France; and, in the past, it was consumed for its therapeutic benefits. In the 14th century, Prior Vital du Four, a cardinal, wrote that it had 40 virtues: Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Armagnac was traded on the markets of Saint-Sever, Mont-de-Marsan, and Aire-sur-l'Adour. Subsequently, Dutch merchants began promoting the trade more widely. The traditional French gourmet dish ortolan has traditionally been prepared by force-feeding an ortolan bunting before drowning it in Armagnac and roasting it. The dish is now legally prohibited due to laws protecting the bird. Geography Vineyards in the Armagnac region near Landes and Gers The Armagnac region lies between the Adour and Garonne rivers in the foothills of the Pyrenees. The region was granted AOC status in 1936. The official production area is divided into three districts that lie in the departements of Gers, Landes, and Lot-et-Garonne. The region contains of grape-producing vines. The Falli√®res Decree of 25 May 1909 describes the three districts: * Bas-Armagnac * Armagnac-T√©nar√®ze * Haut-Armagnac Each of these areas is controlled by separate AOC regulations. The newer appellation Blanche d'Armagnac was established to allow the production and export of clear, white brandies that are unaged.  Production  Armagnac is traditionally distilled once, resulting in 52% of alcohol. This results in a more fragrant and flavorful spirit than cognac, where double distillation takes place. Long ageing in oak barrels softens the taste and causes the development of more complex flavours and a brown colour. Ageing in the barrel removes a part of the alcohol and water by evaporation (known as part des anges‚Äî\\"angels' tribute\\" or \\"angels' share\\") and allows more complex aromatic compounds to appear by oxidation, which further modifies the flavour. Since alcohol evaporates faster than water, the alcohol degree is naturally reduced by an average of 0.4% per year depending on the characteristics of the cellars (average temperature and humidity). When the Armagnac is considered as matured, it is transferred to large glass bottles (called \\"Dame Jeanne\\") for storage. The main difference between Armagnac and other spirits is, that due to its relatively low alcoholic content, it is generally not diluted with water. Armagnac is sold under several classifications, mostly referring to the age of the constituent brandies. Armagnac is allowed to be sold under vintages. When Armagnacs of different ages have been blended, the age on the bottle refers to the youngest component. A three-star, or VS, Armagnac is a mix of several Armagnacs that have seen at least one year of ageing in wood. For VSOP the ageing is at least four years, and for XO and Hors d'√¢ge ten years. Older and better Armagnacs are often sold as vintages, with the bottles containing Armagnac from a single year, the year being noted on the bottle, aged of a minimum of 10 years. =Grapes= Ten different varieties of Armagnac grapes are authorised for use in the production of Armagnac. Of these, four are most common: * Baco blanc * Colombard * Folle blanche * Ugni blanc ReferencesExternal links * Cognac and Armagnac‚ÄîThe official website of France (in English) Category:French distilled drinks ","title":"Armagnac"},{"id":"1637340","text":"The Shafer Commission, formally known as the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, was appointed by U.S. President Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. Its chairman was former Pennsylvania Governor Raymond P. Shafer. The commission issued a report on its findings in 1972 that called for the decriminalization of marijuana possession in the United States. The report was ignored by the White House, but is an important document against prohibition. While the Controlled Substances Act was being drafted in a House committee in 1970, Assistant Secretary of Health Roger O. Egeberg had recommended that marijuana temporarily be placed in Schedule I, the most restrictive category of drugs, pending the Commission's report. On March 22, 1972, the Commission's chairman, Raymond P. Shafer, presented a report to Congress and the public entitled \\"Marihuana, a Signal of Misunderstanding,\\" which favored ending marijuana prohibition and adopting other methods to discourage use. The report was republished as a Signet Books New American Library paperback in 1972. The Commission's report said that while public sentiment tended to view marijuana users as dangerous, they actually found users to be more timid, drowsy and passive. It concluded that cannabis did not cause widespread danger to society. It recommended using social measures other than criminalization to discourage use. It compared the situation of cannabis to that of alcohol. The Commission's proposed decriminalization of marijuana possession was opposed, in 1974, by the recommendations of a congressional subcommittee chaired by Senator James Eastland.Marihuana-hashish epidemic and its impact on United States security: hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Ninety-third Congress, second session [-Ninety-fourth Congress, first session] .. ,1974 The Nixon administration did not implement the recommendations from The National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse.

Jasimuddin completed IA from Rajendra College in 1924. He obtained his BA degree in Bengali from the University of Calcutta in 1929 and his MA in 1931. From 1931 to 1937, he worked with Dinesh Chandra Sen as a collector of folk literature. Jasimuddin is one of the compilers of Purbo-Bongo Gitika (Ballads of East Bengal). He collected more than 10,000 folk songs, some of which has been included in his song compilations Jari Gaan and Murshida Gaan. He also wrote voluminously on the interpretation and philosophy of Bengali folklore. Jasimuddin joined the University of Dhaka in 1938 as a lecturer. He left the university in 1944 and then worked at the Department of Information and Broadcasting until his retirement in 1962 as the deputy director. Tomb of Jasimuddin Poetry Jasimuddin started writing poems at an early age. As a college student, he wrote the celebrated poem Kabar (The Grave), a simple tone to obtain family-religion and tragedy. The poem was placed in the entrance Bengali textbook while he was still a student of Calcutta University. Jasimuddin is noted for his depiction of rural life and nature from the viewpoint of rural people. This had earned the title as Palli Kabi (the rural poet). The structure and content of his poetry bears a strong flavor of Bengal folklore. His Nakshi Kanthar Math (Field of the Embroidered Quilt) is considered a masterpiece and has been translated into many different languages. Jasimuddin was introduced with Abbas Uddin by poet Golam Mostofa in a musical program held in Kolkata in 1931. Major honors and awards * President's Award for Pride of Performance, Pakistan (1958) * DLitt. by Rabindra Bharati University, India (1969) * Ekushey Padak (1976) * Independence Day Award (1978) Personal life Jasimuddin was married to Begum Mamtaz Jasimuddin (d. 2006). Together they had three sons, Kamal Anwar Hashu, Firoz Anwar and Khurshid Anwar, and two daughters, Begum Hasna Moudud and Asma Elahi. Hasna is the wife of politician Moudud Ahmed. Asma is married to Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury. Death and legacy Faridpur Jasimuddin Museum in Faridpur Jasimuddin died on 13 March 1976 and was buried near his ancestral home at Gobindapur, Faridpur. A fortnightly festival known as Jasim Mela is observed at Gobindapur each year in January commemorating his birthday.

It was allied with the supporters of Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans against John the Fearless after Charles' father Louis of Orl√©ans was killed on a Paris street on the orders of the Duke of Burgundy on 23 November 1407. Origins The Armagnac Faction took its name from Charles' father-in- law, Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac (1391‚Äì1418), who guided the young Duke during his teens and provided much of the financing and some of the seasoned Gascon troops that besieged Paris before their defeat at Saint-Cloud. Parisian supporters of the nobles adopted the name \\"Armagnac\\" in the struggle for control of the city against the Burgundians. It was composed of two elements: the Orleanists and those following the Count who gradually infiltrated the noble opposition. Armagnac became an outspoken adherent of the Orleanist Faction in the Valois Court. His Gascon raiders hired to impose order on Paris wore their white shoulder sash. But Armagnac's brutal tactics made his administration very unpopular among Parisians. In February the citizens asked the exiled-John the Fearless to return to the capital. The following month he presented a long document known as The Justification of the Duke of Burgundy containing proof of the Armagnac schemes of intrigue. Orleans pleaded with the king, but Charles insisted on setting a meeting in Chartres to conjure a reconciliation. Meanwhile by the end of December 1409, the Burgundians had infiltrated all posts of local officials to take control of city governance. The Armagnacs withdrew altogether from city politics to form the League of Gien, they were joined by disaffected Princes of the Blood: John, Duke of Berry, the youngest brother of King Charles V, Louis, Duke of Anjou, John, Duke of Bourbon, John I, Duke of Alen√ßon, John V, Duke of Brittany, Charles d'Albret, Constable of France, and John, Count of Clermont. These nobles formed the political and military elite of the Armagnac faction. The Burgundians met them at the Peace of Bicetres, a attempted truce designed iron out their differences. it largely failed because as the Armagnacs laid siege to Paris, a small English force landed at Calais to assist the Burgundian government. In October 1411 they marched towards Paris. In May 1412, the Armagnacs suffered a second reverse at the Treaty of Bourges. Thomas, Duke of Clarence, a fiery cavalry general, demanded considerable territorial concessions including Normandy in return for aid to Burgundy. Now desperate to save the honour of the Oriflamme the Armagnacs resorted to seeking English arbitration in the internal dispute. At the Treaty of Buzancais the English demanded a punitively large ransom from the Armagnacs. In a series of humiliating encounters their leading general, Dauphin Louis, Duke of Guyenne was outmanoeuvred, defeated and forced into a Treaty of Auxerre. Later, John the Fearless was sent back to his lands, and Bernard of Armagnac remained in Paris and, some say, in the queen's bed. He was assassinated in 1419. Sporadic warfare continued between the Armagnacs and Burgundians for a number of years, although after the Burgundians allied themselves with the English in 1419 and the Armagnacs became interlinked with the cause of Charles VII, the factional rivalry was scarcely distinguishable from the Royal dispute between the French and English monarchies. The terms remained in use until they were outlawed by Charles VII toward the close of the Hundred Years' War, as part of efforts to heal the factional rift.

He is perhaps best known for his opera Die Soldaten, which is regarded as one of the most important German operas of the 20th century, after those of Berg.Andrew D. McCredie and Marion Roth√§rmel, \\"Zimmermann, Bernd Alois\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell. London: Macmillan Publishers. As a result of his individual style, it is hard to label his music as avant-garde, serial or postmodern. His music employs a wide range of methods including the twelve- tone row and musical quotation. Life Zimmermann was born in Bliesheim (now part of Erftstadt) near Cologne. He grew up in a rural Catholic community in western Germany. His father worked for the German Reichsbahn (Imperial Railway) and was also a farmer. In 1929, Zimmermann began attending a private Catholic school, where he had his first real encounter with music. After the National Socialists (or Nazis) closed all private schools, he switched to a public Catholic school in Cologne where, in 1937, he received his Abitur, the German equivalent of a high school diploma. In the same year, he fulfilled his duty for the Reichsarbeitsdienst and spent the 1937/1938 winter semester studying pedagogy at the Hochschule f√ºr Lehrerausbildung (lit. University for Teacher Training) in Bonn. He began studying Music Education, Musicology and Composition in the winter of 1938 at the University for Music in Cologne. In 1940, he was drafted in the Wehrmacht (the German Army) but was released in 1942 due to a severe skin illness. After he returned to his studies, he didn't receive a degree until 1947 due to the ending of the war. However, he was already busy as a free-lance composer in 1946, predominantly for radio. From 1948 to 1950, he was a participant in the Kranichsteiner/Darmst√§dter Ferienkursen f√ºr Neue Musik (lit. Kranichstein/Darmstadt Vacation Course for New Music) where he studied under Ren√© Leibowitz and Wolfgang Fortner, among others. In 1957, he received a scholarship to spend time at the German Academy Villa Massimo in Rome. He also assumed the position of Professor of Composition (from Frank Martin) as well as Film and Broadcast Music at the Cologne Music University. In the 60s, he received more attention and success as a composer (including a second scholarship to the Villa Massimo in 1963 and a fellowship in the Academy of Arts, Berlin), especially after his opera Die Soldaten (The Soldiers) finally premiered in 1965. The opera had previously not been performed due to the enormous number of people required and the musical difficulty‚Äîthe Cologne Opera had considered it \\"unspielbar\\" (not performable). The composer's depressive tendencies increased to a more physical level, compounded by a quickly deteriorating eye problem. On 10 August 1970, Zimmermann committed suicide at his home in K√∂nigsdorf near Cologne ‚Äì just five days after completing the score of his last composition, Ich wandte mich und sah an alles Unrecht das geschah unter der Sonne. At the time, he was preparing another opera, Medea, after Hans Henny Jahnn. Music In his own compositional growth, he took his place in the progression of new music, from which the German composers were mostly separated during the Nazi regime. He began writing works in the neoclassical style, continued with free atonality and twelve-tone music and eventually arrived at serialism (in 1956). His affection for jazz can sometimes be heard in some of his compositions (more so in his Violin Concerto or Trumpet Concerto). In contrast to the so- called Darmstadt School (Stockhausen, Boulez, Nono, etc.), Zimmermann did not make a radical break with tradition. At the end of the 1950s, he developed his own personal compositional style, the pluralistic \\"Klangkomposition\\" (German word referring to the compositional style that focuses on planes ‚Äì or areas ‚Äì of sound and tone-colors). The combination and overlapping of layers of musical material from various time periods (from Medieval to Baroque and Classical to Jazz and Pop music) using advanced musical techniques is characteristic of Klangkomposition. Zimmermann's use of this technique ranged from the embedding of individual musical quotes (seen somewhat in his orchestral work Photoptosis) to pieces that are built entirely as a collage (the ballet Musique pour les soupers du Roi Ubu). In his vocal works, especially his Requiem for a Young Poet, the text is used to progress the piece by overlapping texts from various sources. He created his own musical stance using the metaphor \\"the spherical form of time\\".'Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Germany (1918‚Äì1970)' UbuWeb (Accessed 28 May 2006) Works * Extemporale for piano (1946) * Capriccio for Piano * Lob der Torheit (burlesque cantata by Goethe), for solo, choir and large orchestra (1947) * Enchiridion I for piano (1949) * M√§rchensuite for orchestra (1950) * Alagoana (Caprichos Brasileiros) Ballet Suite (1950) * Rheinische Kirmest√§nze (1950, rearranged in 1962 for 13 wind instruments) * Concert for Violin and orchestra (1950) * Sonata for solo violin (1951) * Symphony in one movement (1951, revised 1953) * Enchiridion II for piano (1951) * Concerto for oboe and chamber orchestra (1952) * Des Menschen Unterhaltsproze√ü gegen Gott (lit.

The International Energy Agency Bioenergy Task 42 defined biorefining as \\"the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products (food, feed, chemicals, materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat)\\". As refineries, biorefineries can provide multiple chemicals by fractioning an initial raw material (biomass) into multiple intermediates (carbohydrates, proteins, triglycerides) that can be further converted into value-added products. Each refining phase is also referred to as a \\"cascading phase\\".Cascading termCascading phases term The use of biomass as feedstock can provide a benefit by reducing the impacts on the environment, as lower pollutants emissions and reduction in the emissions of hazard products. In addition, biorefineries are intended to achieve the following goals: # Supply the current fuels and chemical building blocks # Supply new building blocks for the production of novel materials with disruptive characteristics # Creation of new jobs, including rural areas # Valorization of waste (agricultural, urban, and industrial waste)  Classification of biorefinery systems  Biorefineries can be classified based in four main features: # Platforms: Refers to key intermediates between raw material and final products. The most important intermediates are: #* Biogas from anaerobic digestion #* Syngas from gasification #* Hydrogen from water-gas shift reaction, steam reforming, water electrolysis and fermentation #* C6 sugars from hydrolysis of sucrose, starch, cellulose and hemicellulose #* C5 sugars (e.g., xylose, arabinose: C5H10O5), from hydrolysis of hemicellulose and food and feed side streams #* Lignin from the processing of lignocellulosic biomass. #* Liquid from Pyrolysis (pyrolysis oil) # Products: Biorefineries can be grouped in two main categories according to the conversion of biomass in a energetic or non-energetic product. In this classification the main market must be identified: #* Energy-driven biorefinery systems: The main product is a second energy carrier as biofuels, power and heat. #* Material-driven biorefinery systems: The main product is a biobased product # Feedstock: Dedicated feedstocks (Sugar crops, starch crops, lignocellulosic crops, oil-based crops, grasses, marine biomass); and residues (oil-based residues, lignocellulosic residues, organic residues and others) # Processes: Conversion process to transform biomass into a final product: #* Mechanical/physical: The chemical structure of the biomass components is preserved. This operation includes pressing, milling, separation, distillation, among others #* Biochemical: Processes under low temperature and pressure, using microorganism or enzymes. #* Chemical processes: The substrate suffer change by the action of an external chemical (e.g., hydrolysis, transesterification, hydrogenation, oxidation, pulping) #* Thermochemical: Severe conditions are apply to the feedstock (high pressure and high temperature, with or without catalyst). The aforementioned features are used to classified biorefineries systems according to the following method: # Identify the feedstock, the main technologies included in the process, platform, and the final products # Draw the scheme of the refinery using the features identified in step 1. # Label the refinery system according by citing the number of platforms, products, feedstock, and processes involved # Elaborate a table with the features identified, and the source of internal energy demand Some examples of classifications are: * C6 sugar platform biorefinery for bioethanol and animal feed from starch crops. * Syngas platform biorefinery for FT-diesel and phenols from straw * C6 and C5 sugar and syngas platform biorefinery for bioethanol, FT-diesel and furfural from saw mill residues.  Economic viability of biorefinery systems  Techno- economic assessment (TEA) is a methodology to evaluate whether a technology or process is economically attractive. TEA research has been developed to provide information about the performance of the biorefinery concept in diverse production systems as sugarcane mills, biodiesel production, pulp and paper mills, and the treatment of industrial and municipal solids waste. Bioethanol plants and sugarcane mills are well-established processes where the biorefinery concept can be implemented since sugarcane bagasse is a feasible feedstock to produce fuels and chemicals; lignocellulosic bioethanol (2G) is produced in Brazil in two plants with capacities of 40 and 84 Ml/y (about 0.4% of the production capacity in Brazil). TEA of ethanol production using mild liquefaction of bagasse plus simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation shows a minimum selling price between 50.38 and 62.72 US cents/L which is comparable with the market price. The production of xylitol, citric acid and glutamic acid from sugarcane lignocellulose (bagasse and harvesting residues), each in combination with electricity have been evaluated; the three biorefinery systems were simulated to be annexed to an existing sugar mill in South Africa. The production of xylitol and glutamic acid has shown economic feasibility with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 12.3% and 31.5%, exceeding the IRR of the base case (10.3%). Likewise, the production of ethanol, lactic acid or methanol and ethanol-lactic acid from sugarcane bagasse have been studied; lactic acid demonstrated to be economically attractive by showing the greatest net present value (M$ 476‚Äì1278); in the same way; the production of ethanol and lactic acid as co-product was found to be a favorable scenario (net present value between M$ 165 and M$ 718) since this acid has applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, chemical and food industry. As for biodiesel production, this industry also has the potential to integrate biorefinery systems to convert residual biomasses and wastes into biofuel, heat, electricity and bio-based green products. Glycerol is the main co-product in biodiesel production and can be transformed into valuable products through chemocatalytic technologies; the valorization of glycerol for the production of lactic acid, acrylic acid, allyl alcohol, propanediols, and glycerol carbonate has been evaluated; all glycerol valorization routes shown to be profitable, being the most attractive the manufacture of glycerol carbonate. Palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) are an abundant lignocellulosic residues from the palm oil/biodiesel industry, the conversion of this residue into ethanol, heat and power, and cattle feed were evaluated according to techno-economic principles, the scenarios under study shown reduced economic benefits, although their implementation represented a reduction in the environmental impact (climate change and fossil fuel depletion) compared to the traditional biodiesel production. The economic feasibility for bio-oil production from EFB via fast pyrolysis using the fluidized-bed was studied, crude bio-oil can potentially be produced from EFB at a product value of 0.47 $/kg with a payback period and return on investment of 3.2 years and 21.9%, respectively. The integration of microalgae and Jatropha as a viable route for the production of biofuels and biochemicals has been analyzed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) context. Three scenarios were examined; in all of them, biodiesel and glycerol is produced; in the first scenario biogas and organic fertilizer is produced by anaerobic fermentation of Jatropha fruit cake and seedcake; the second scenario includes the production of lipids from jatropha and microalgae to produce biodiesel and the production of animal feed, biogas and organic fertilizer; the third scenario involves the production of lipids from microalgae for the production of biodiesel as well as hydrogen and animal feed as final product; only the first scenario was profitable. In regard to the pulp and paper industry; lignin is a natural polymer co-generated and is generally used as boiler fuel to generate heat or steam to cover the energy demand in the process. Since lignin accounts for 10‚Äì30 wt% of the available lignocellulosic biomass and is equivalent to ~40% of its energy contents; the economics of biorefineries depend on the cost-effective processes to transform lignin into value-added fuels and chemicals. The conversion of an existing Swedish kraft pulp mill to the production of dissolving pulp, electricity, lignin, and hemicellulose has been studied; self-sufficiency in terms of steam and the production of excess steam was a key factor for the integration of a lignin separation plant; in this case; the digester has to be upgraded for preserving the same production level and represents 70 % of the total investment cost of conversion. The potential of using the kraft process for producing bioethanol from softwoods in a repurposed or co-located kraft mill has been studied, a sugar recovery higher than 60% enables the process to be competitive for the production of ethanol from softwood. The repurposing of a kraft pulp mill to produce both Ethanol and dimethyl-ether has been investigated; in the process, cellulose is separated by and an alkaline pretreatment and then is hydrolyzed and fermented to produce ethanol, while the resulting liquor containing dissolved lignin is gasified and refined to dimethyl ether; the process demonstrate to be self-sufficient in terms of hot utility (fresh steam) demand but with a deficit of electricity; the process can be feasible, economically speaking, but is highly dependent on the development of biofuel prices. The exergetic and economic evaluation for the production of catechol from lignin was performed to determine its feasibility; the results showed that the total capital investment was 4.9 M$ based on the plant capacity of 2,544 kg/d of feedstock; besides, the catechol price was estimated to be 1,100 $/t and the valorization ratio was found to be 3.02. The high generation of waste biomass is an attractive source for conversion to valuable products, several biorefinery routes has been proposed to upgrade waste streams in valuable products. The production of biogas from banana peel (Musa paradisiaca) under the biorefinery concept is a promissory alternative since is possible to obtain biogas and other co-products including ethanol, xylitol, syngas, and electricity; this process also provides high profitability for high production scales. The economic assessment of the integration of organic waste anaerobic digestion with other mixed culture anaerobic fermentation technologies was studied; the highest profit is obtained by dark fermentation of food waste with separation and purification of acetic and butyric acids (47 USD/t of foodwaste). The technical feasibility, profitability and extent of investment risk to produce sugar syrups from food and beverage waste was analyzed; the returns on investment shown to be satisfactory for the production of fructose syrup (9.4%), HFS42 (22.8%) and glucose-rich syrup (58.9%); the sugar syrups also have high cost competitiveness with relatively low net production costs and minimum selling prices. The valorization of municipal solid waste through integrated mechanical biological chemical treatment (MBCT) systems for the production of levulinic acid has been studied, the revenue from resource recovery and product generation (without the inclusion of gate fees) is more than enough to out- weigh the waste collection fees, annual capital and operating costs.  Environmental impact of biorefinery systems  One of the main goals of biorefineries is to contribute to a more sustainable industry by the conservation of resources and by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Nevertheless; other environmental impacts may be associated to the production of biobased products; as land use change, eutrophication of water, the pollution of the environment with pesticides, or higher energy and material demand that lead to environmental burdens. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology to evaluate the environmental load of a process, from the extraction of raw materials to the end use. LCA can be used to investigate the potential benefits of biorefinery systems; multiple LCA studies has been developed to analyse whether biorefineries are more environmentally friendly compared to conventional alternatives. Feedstock is one of the main sources of environmental impacts in the biofuel production, the source of this impacts are related to the field operation to grow, handle and transport the biomass to the biorefinery gate. Agricultural residues are the feedstock with the lowest environmental impact followed by lignocellulosic crops; and finally by first-generation arable crops, although the environmental impacts are sensitive to factors such as crop management practices, harvesting systems, and crop yields. The production of chemicals from biomass feedstock has shown environmental benefits; bulk chemicals from biomass-derived feedstocks have been studied showing savings on non renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental assessment for 1G and 2G ethanol shows that these two biorefinery systems are able to mitigate climate change impacts in comparison to gasoline, but higher climate change benefits are achieved with 2G ethanol production (up to 80% reduction). The conversion of palm empty fruit bunches into valuable products (ethanol, heat and power, and cattle feed) reduces the impact for climate change and fossil fuel depletion compared to the traditional biodiesel production; but the benefits for toxicity and eutrophication are limited. Propionic acid produced by fermentation of glycerol leads to significant reduction of GHG emissions compared to fossil fuel alternatives; however the energy input is double and the contribution to eutrophication is significantly higher The LCA for the integration of butanol from prehydrolysate in a Canadian Kraft dissolving pulp mill shows that the carbon footprint of this butanol may be 5% lower compare to gasoline; but is not as low as corn butanol (23% lower than that of gasoline). The majority of the LCA studies for the valorization of food waste have been focused on the environmental impacts on biogas or energy production, with only few on the synthesis of high value-added chemicals; hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been listed as one of the top 10 bio-based chemicals by the US Department of Energy; the LCA of eight food waste valorization routes for the production of HMF shows that the most environmentally favorable option uses less polluting catalyst (AlCl3) and co-solvent (acetone), and provides the highest yield of HMF (27.9 Cmol%), metal depletion and toxicity impacts (marine ecotoxicity, freshwater toxicity, and human toxicity) were the categories with the highest values.  Biorefinery in the pulp and paper industry  The pulp and paper industry is considered as the first industrialized biorefinery system; in this industrial process other co-products are produced including tall oil, rosin, vanillin, and lignosulfonates. Apart from these co-products; the system includes energy generation (in for of steam and electricity) to cover its internal energy demand; and it has the potential to feed heat and electricity to the grid. This industry has consolidated as the highest consumer of biomass; and uses not only wood as feedstock, it is capable of processing agricultural waste as bagasse, rice straw and corn stover. Other important features of this industry is a well-established logistic for biomass production, avoids competition with food production for fertile land, and presents higher biomass yields. Examples The fully operational Blue Marble Energy company has multiple biorefineries located in Odessa, WA and Missoula, MT. Canada's first Integrated Biorefinery, developed on anaerobic digestion technology by Himark BioGas is located in Alberta. The biorefinery utilizes Source Separated Organics from the metro Edmonton region, open pen feedlot manure, and food processing waste.

She was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1995, and served as a high-profile cabinet minister in the government of Bob Rae. Background Grier grew up in Dublin, Ireland and immigrated to Canada in 1956. Before leaving Dublin she obtained a degree in public administration at Trinity College. After arriving in Toronto she went to University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto and obtained degrees in Political Science and Economics. She and her husband, Terry Grier, have three children. Terry was a New Democratic Party member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1972 to 1974 and served as president of Ryerson Polytechnical Institute from 1988 to 1995. PoliticsMunicipal= Grier was elected as an alderman in Mimico area in the borough of Etobicoke in 1969. She beat her opponent Gordon Rush by 31 votes. She supported Walter Pitman for the 1970 Ontario NDP leadership race. Pitman came in second to winner Stephen Lewis. She remained in the position until 1985. In 1984 she put her name forward to replace Dennis Flynn as mayor of Etobicoke. Fellow alderman Bruce Sinclair was the eventual winner. She remained as alderman until 1985 when she ran for election in the provincial election. =Provincial= Grier ran as the NDP candidate in the riding of Lakeshore. She ran on a campaign criticizing Tory incumbent Al Kolyn of being lax on environmental issues and on the closing of the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital in 1979. She won the election defeating both second place Liberal candidate Frank Sgarlata by 2,037 votes and Kolyn who finished third. In June 1985, she was named as her party's Critic for the Environment, a post which she held until 1990. In December 1986, Grier proposed an Environmental Bill of Rights. Under her proposed legislation, private groups or individuals would be able to take a polluter to court even if they hadn't been personally affected by the pollution. Although the bill was introduced in 1986 and re-introduced in December 1987 and had previously been proposed and supported by the Liberals, the bill failed to move forward through the legislature. The Liberals won a majority in the 1987 provincial election. Grier was re-elected, again defeating challengers Sgarlata and Kolyn. In January 1989, Grier sponsored a private member's bill that proposed to ban the sale of irradiated foods in Ontario. In March 1990, she proposed another private member's bill that would more strictly regulate businesses that stockpiled used tires. This came about due to a large tire fire in Hagersville, Ontario. This idea was adopted by the Liberal government in the form of a tax on tires that was targeted towards recycling programs, although in the short term it meant an increase in tires being sent to landfill. =In government= The NDP won a majority government in the 1990 provincial election and Grier won her riding handily. She was appointed as the Minister of the Environment on 1 October 1990. As Environment Minister, Grier cancelled plans to ship Toronto's garbage to a waste site in Durham, and vetoed a similar plan for Adams Mine in the northern community of Kirkland Lake. The government eventually authorized the creation of three new landfill sites near Toronto, one of which was located on prime farmland. Grier also set limits on the amount of chlorine that pulp and paper mills could dump into rivers and lakes, and rejected one particular downtown Toronto housing project on the grounds that removing industrial waste from the region was prohibitively expensive. She also introduced an Environmental Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights gave Ontarians the right to sue polluters and it increased the protection for whistleblowing employees. It also created the office of Environmental Commissioner. On 3 February 1993, she was transferred to the Ministry of Health. As Health Minister, Grier supported the listing of generic drugs over large pharmaceutical companies. In 1993, her government made a generous settlement with the province's doctors via an Interim Agreement of Economic Arrangements. Despite strong personal objections, she also introduced user fees for some drug coverage in the summer of 1993. Her government also introduced midwifery as a profession, targeted resources toward community health centres, created a Task Force on the Prevention of Cancer and introduced the Trillium Drug Plan. Notwithstanding her efforts to pursue some traditional NDP policies while in government, Grier generally supported Bob Rae in his efforts to move the party to the political centre. In Bob Rae's memoir, From Protest to Power, he listed Grier as one of his top six closest associates. The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election, and Grier finished third in her bid for re-election in Etobicoke--Lakeshore, losing to Progressive Conservative Morley Kells. =Cabinet posts=After politics Afterwards, she was a regular panelist on Fourth Reading, on the TVOntario program Studio 2. In 2000, she along with husband Terry both received honorary doctorates from Ryerson University. Grier was named Visiting Environmentalist at the University of Toronto in 1997, and remains involved in environmental concerns.

Facts The state of Minnesota passed laws limiting what railroads could charge in that state and established severe penalties, including fines and jail for violators. Some shareholders of Northern Pacific Railway filed a lawsuit in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Minnesota asserting that the laws were unconstitutional as violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the Dormant Commerce Clause. The shareholders sued the railroads to prevent them from complying with the law. They also sued Edward T. Young, the Attorney General of Minnesota, to prevent him from enforcing the law. Young argued that the Eleventh Amendment, which prohibits states from being sued by citizens of other states, meant that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. The federal circuit court still issued an injunction against Young enforcing the law. The following day, Young filed a proceeding in Minnesota state court to force the railroads to comply with the statute. The court ordered Young to explain his actions, and he reiterated his Eleventh Amendment claim, whereupon the court held Young in contempt. Young was placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, and so he filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus for his release. Issue The Supreme Court faced three issues here. The first involved three questions as to the constitutionality of the Minnesota statutes: # Did the statutes violate Fourteenth Amendment due process by setting too low a cap on the rates that railroads could charge? # Did the statutes violate Fourteenth Amendment due process by establishing punishments so harsh that no one would challenge the laws, for fear of the consequences of losing such a challenge? # Did the statutes violate the Commerce Clause by interfering with commerce between the states? The second issue exposed the tension between the Eleventh Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment had recently been held in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), to prohibit the federal courts from hearing suits by citizens against their own states. Conversely, the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the states from violating the due process rights of their citizens. Could a federal court entertain a lawsuit seeking to enjoin a state official from carrying out state laws that were purportedly in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment? Result The Court, in an opinion written by Justice Rufus Wheeler Peckham, quickly found that the Minnesota laws with respect to the railroad rates were unconstitutional, and moved on to the issue of whether the state official could be enjoined from prosecuting violations of such laws. Failure to enjoin the unconstitutional statute would require the person subject to a potential violation to either pay the increased rate or face the threat of prosecution. Therefore, the Court determined that it would be unfair to require challengers of a law to wait until they faced a harsh sanction before they could bring any kind of action questioning the validity of that law. The Court also noted that, although a number of cases had held that the state itself could not be sued, those cases did not prohibit enjoining a state official, as an individual, from carrying out some task on behalf of the state. Young contended that he was merely acting for the state of Minnesota when he sought to enforce its laws. The Court disagreed, holding that when a state official does something that is unconstitutional, the official cannot possibly be doing it in the name of the state, because the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution means that the Constitution overrides all the laws of the states, invalidating any contrary laws. Therefore, when a state official attempts to enforce an unconstitutional law, that individual is stripped of his official character. He becomes merely another citizen who can constitutionally be brought before a court by a party seeking injunctive relief. The Court, in laying out this doctrine, created two legal fictions: # That such a suit is not against the state, but merely against the individual officer, who cannot be acting on behalf of the state when he enforces a law that is unconstitutional; and # That an individual can be a state actor for Fourteenth Amendment purposes (which only prohibits unconstitutional acts by the state, and those who represent it) while remaining a private person for sovereign immunity purposes. The Court also rejected the contention raised by Young that an injunction was inappropriate because the railroads could get an adequate remedy by testing the statute in the courts. The Court noted that the railroads could never recover the costs of obeying the law while waiting for it to be adjudicated unconstitutional. Based on these findings, the Court held that suits may be brought to enjoin state officials from enforcing unconstitutional laws in the United States District Courts, which have the power to enjoin those officials from enforcing such laws. Dissent Justice John Marshall Harlan angrily dissented, writing that the only reason that the suit was brought against Young was because he represented the state, and that the result of the suit would be to \\"tie the hands of the state\\". This was therefore no different from a suit against the state itself, prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment. Harlan observed that the state can never act except through its officers, and this decision would deprive the state of the representation of its officers in court. He therefore condemned the decision as a \\"radical change in our government system\\" that \\"would place the states of the Union in a condition of inferiority never dreamed of when the Constitution was adopted or when the Eleventh Amendment was made a part of the supreme law of the land.\\" Harlan also contended that Constitutional rights can be enforced by suits in the state courts, instead of the federal courts.

As a playwright he is generally seen as a disciple of Jacob Gordin, but his mature work was more character-driven, more open and realistic in its presentation of human sexual desire, and less polemical than Gordin's. Many of his plays were \\"ghetto dramas\\" dealing with issues of tradition and assimilation and with generational issues between Jewish immigrants to America and the first generation of American-born Jews. Life and works Born in Vitsebsk, then part of Imperial Russia, culturally considered at that time part of Lithuania, now in Belarus, he wrote at first in Russian (Schulman & Denman 2007). In 1892 he emigrated to the United States, settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; only then did he develop an interest in Yiddish literature and theater (Schulman & Denman 2007). In the U.S. he first worked menial jobs in Philadelphia, as well as in rural Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, before moving to New York City (Sandrow 1986, p. 172). He became a journalist, then a writer of short stories, and finally gained fame as a playwright. He began writing in Yiddish by translating stories from Russian; the first original story he published was \\"A merder oys libe\\" (A Murderer for Love), which appeared in the newspaper Filadelfyer Shtot-Tsaytung, in 1894 (Schulman & Denman 2007). Kobrin's first play, Mine (Minna), was rewritten and adapted by Jacob Gordin for a production in 1899, with the original text appearing in print later the same year (Sandrow 1986, p. 169-170; Schulman & Denman 2007). Gordin's strong influence on Kobrin's work is reflected in his next play, Natur, Mensh un Khaye (Nature, Man and Beast, 1900), which consciously alludes to Gordin's Got, Mensh un Tayvl (God, Man, and the Devil, 1893). Liptzin singles out Kobrin's tragedy Yankel Boyle (1908, based on his own 1898 story) as the \\"apex\\" of his work, and describes its title character as \\"a kindhearted but dull-witted Jewish youth ‚Ä¶ embroiled in a complex moral and emotional dilemma to which he could find no solution short of suicide\\" (Liptzin 1972, p. 81). Kobrin's 30 or so plays spanned both \\"golden ages\\" of Yiddish theater in America. When he started as a playwright at the turn of the 20th century, Yiddish theater was bringing to America challenging modern classics, such as the works of Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, and Leo Tolstoy, sometimes before these had yet been presented on the English-language American stage; and his career continued into the era of the art theater movement in Yiddish, exemplified in New York by Maurice Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theatre. Kobrin continued, throughout his life, to contribute to Yiddish-language newspapers. He also worked extensively as a translator of modern classics from French and Russian into Yiddish. Among the authors whose work he translated were Guy de Maupassant, √âmile Zola, Maxim Gorky, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Anton Chekhov. His wife, Pauline, collaborated on some of these translations.

Griffith Borgeson called him \\"the greatest creative figure in the history of the American racing car\\". Cars built by Miller won the Indianapolis 500 nine times, and other cars using his engines won three more. Millers accounted for 83% of the Indy 500 fields between 1923 and 1928.  Biography  Miller was born on December 9, 1875, in Menomonie, Wisconsin, to Jacob Miller (1833‚Äì1900) and Martha Ann (Tuttle) Miller (c1835‚Äì1922). Miller's first work in the automotive business was with the short-lived Yale Automobile Company. From Yale he moved to Lansing, Michigan, to work for motoring pioneer Ransom E. Olds at Oldsmobile, where he was employed as a race mechanic during the early Vanderbilt cup races. After a poor 1906 race season, Miller left for Los Angeles, California, to open a small machine shop specializing in carburetor production. Among Miller's innovations include perhaps the first engine mounted on a bicycle and the first outboard motor. Miller built a 4 cylinder engine and mounted it on a boat. His neighbor, Ole Evinrude, removed two cylinders and patented the first outboard motor. Miller also produced the first aluminum pistons, developed the aluminum alloys still used in engine development today, and the first carburetors and induction system to use Helmholtz resonators. Miller also produced the first front drive race cars and the first 4 wheel drive car. His involvement with the racing side of his carburetor business led first to repairing and then building race cars. In the 1910s, Miller was making $1 million per year through sales of his carburetors. In the early 1920s, he built his own 3.0 litre (183 in¬≥) engine. Inspired by multiple engine designs including Duesenberg and Peugeot engines which had been serviced in his shop, it had 4 cylinders, dual overhead camshafts and 4 valves per cylinder. Tommy Milton supplied the financial backing to produce this engine but it was Jimmy Murphy who first won with it. It powered Jimmy Murphy's Duesenberg to victory in the 1922 Indianapolis 500. Miller then progressed to making Miller single-seater race cars that used supercharged versions of his 2.0 and 1.5 liter (122 and 91 in¬≥) engines. The engines took four more wins in the 500 up to 1929, twice (1926 and 1928) in Miller chassis, and won the race another seven times between 1929 and 1938 (twice again, in 1930 and 1932, in Miller chassis). In the 1920s and 1930s, Miller engines also powered speedboats to several race wins and world water speed records. Among those that won with his engines on the water was the great Gar Wood. Miller declared bankruptcy in 1933. His shop foreman and chief machinist Fred Offenhauser purchased the business and continued development of the engine as the Offenhauser which raced successfully until the 1980s. After bankruptcy, Miller built race cars with Indianapolis 500 enthusiast Preston Tucker, and in 1935 they formed Miller and Tucker, Inc., whose first job was to build ten modified Ford V-8 racers for Henry Ford. With insufficient time available for their development and testing, all these cars dropped out when the steering boxes, installed too close to the exhaust, overheated and locked up. The design was later perfected by privateers, and examples ran at Indianapolis through 1948. Miller and Tucker, Inc., moved to Indianapolis and continued race car development and construction. In the late 1930s, Miller and Tucker also developed the Tucker Combat Car and tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the Dutch and U.S. governments. The car was capable of on pavement and on rough terrain, and had several innovative features including a power-operated gun turret, which the U.S. government bought and used in numerous applications including the B-17 and B-29, PT boats, and landing craft.

Tucker and Miller worked together off and on until Miller's death in 1943. Tucker helped Miller's widow pay the funeral costs. It was while working with Miller that Tucker had met chief mechanic John Eddie Offutt, who would later help him develop and build the first prototype of the 1948 Tucker Sedan. Miller died on May 3, 1943, at Grace Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, at age 67.

The plot follows a young man in a small midwestern town who becomes involved with a family of nomadic American vampires. Despite performing poorly at the box office, critic reviews were very positive. Over the years, the film has gained a cult following. Plot One night, Caleb Colton (Adrian Pasdar), a young man in a small town, meets an attractive young drifter named Mae (Jenny Wright). Just before sunrise, she bites him on the neck and runs off. The rising sun causes Caleb's flesh to smoke and burn. Mae arrives with a group of roaming vampires in an RV and takes him away. The most psychotic of the vampires, Severen (Bill Paxton), wants to kill Caleb but Mae reveals that she has already turned him. Their charismatic leader Jesse Hooker (Lance Henriksen) reluctantly agrees to allow Caleb to remain with them for a week, to see if he can learn to hunt and gain the group's trust. Caleb is unwilling to kill to feed, which alienates him from the others. To protect him, Mae kills for him and then has him drink from her wrist. Jesse's group enters a bar and kills the occupants. They set the bar on fire and flee the scene. After Caleb endangers himself to help them escape their motel room during a daylight police raid, Jesse and the others are temporarily mollified, with Caleb asking Jesse how old he was and told he \\"fought for the South\\", making him about 150 years old (Severen later suggests he and Jesse started the Great Chicago Fire of 1871). Caleb's father (Tim Thomerson) searches for Jesse's group. A child vampire in the group, Homer (Joshua John Miller) meets Caleb's sister Sarah (Marcie Leeds) and wants to turn her into his companion, but Caleb objects. While the group argues, Caleb's father arrives and holds them at gunpoint, demanding that Sarah be released. Jesse taunts him into shooting but regurgitates the bullet before wrestling the gun away. In the confusion, Sarah opens a door, letting in the sunlight and forcing the vampires back. Burning, Caleb escapes with his family. Caleb suggests they try giving him a blood transfusion to attempt to cure him. The transfusion successfully reverses Caleb's transformation. That night, the vampires search for Caleb and Sarah. Mae distracts Caleb by trying to persuade him to return to her while the others kidnap his sister. Caleb discovers the kidnapping and his tires slashed but gives chase on horseback. When the horse shies and throws him, he is confronted by Severen. Caleb commandeers a tractor-trailer and runs Severen over. The injured vampire suddenly appears on the hood of the truck and manages to rip apart the wiring in the engine. Caleb jackknifes the vehicle and jumps out as the truck explodes, killing Severen. Seeking revenge, Jesse and his girlfriend Diamondback (Jenette Goldstein) pursue him but are forced to escape in their car as dawn breaks. Not wanting Sarah to become another childlike monster, Mae breaks out of the back of the car with Sarah. Mae's flesh begins to smoke as she is burned by the sun but she carries Sarah into Caleb's arms, taking refuge under his jacket. Homer attempts to follow, but as he runs he dies from exposure to the sun. Their sunproofing ruined, Jesse and Diamondback also begin to burn. They attempt to run Caleb and Sarah over but fail, dying as the car blows up. Mae awakens later, her burns now healed. She too has been given a transfusion and is cured. She and Caleb comfort each other in a reassuring hug as the film ends.

Kathryn Bigelow wanted to film a Western movie that departed from cinematic convention. When she and co-writer Eric Red found financial backing for a Western difficult to obtain, it was suggested to them that they try mixing a Western with another, more popular genre. Her interest in revisionist interpretation of cinematic tradition led her and Red to combine two genres that they regarded as ripe for reinterpretation: the Western movie and the vampire movie. The combination of the genres had been visited at least twice before on the big screen, with Curse of the Undead (1959) and Billy the Kid Versus Dracula (1966). Bigelow knew (and later married) director James Cameron, who directed Aliens (1986), a film that shares three cast members (Paxton, Goldstein and Henriksen) with Near Dark. Actor Michael Biehn was offered the role of Jesse Hooker, but he rejected the role because he found the script confusing. Lance Henriksen took over the role.What the Hell Happened to Michael Biehn? - Article on the website Lebeau's Le Blog A cinema seen in the background early in the film has Aliens on its marquee and Cameron played the man who \\"flips off\\" Severen. =Soundtrack= Near Dark is the thirty-second major release and tenth soundtrack album by Tangerine Dream. It was released in 1988. Release Near Dark was released on October 2, 1987 in 262 theaters, grossing US$635,789 on its opening weekend. It went on to make $3.4 million, below its $5 million budget. =Critical response= Part of a late 1980s revival of serious vampire depictions on the big screen, it received mostly positive reviews for its mix of the Western, biker and vampire movie genres. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Near Dark holds a 88% approval rating based on 49 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.54/10. The consensus reads: \\"Near Dark is at once a creepy vampire film, a thrilling western, and a poignant family tale, with humor and scares in abundance.‚Äù In her review for The New York Times, Caryn James wrote, \\"Ms. Bigelow's too-studied compositions ‚Äì Caleb in silhouette riding a horse toward the camera ‚Äì clash with her unstudied approach to the characters' looks\\". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader was impressed by Bigelow's first foray into big budget films with the \\"hillbilly vampire\\" movie, describing it as \\"beautifully shot\\". Hal Hinson of The Washington Post said the intermixing of vampire legends, westerns and biker movies has an end result that is \\"both outrageous and poetic; it has extravagant, bloody thrills plus something else ‚Äì something that comes close to genuine emotion\\". Jay Scott in his review for The Globe and Mail wrote, \\"Bill Paxton as the undead sex symbol ‚Äì is exceptional, but not exceptional enough to put across the cop-out that concludes the film\\". Richard Corliss of Time magazine called Near Dark \\"weird (and) beautiful\\" and \\"the all-time teenage vampire love story\\". Richard Schickel (also of Time) considers the film a clever variant of the vampire film genre. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone concurred, calling it \\"gory and gorgeous\\". Cancelled remake A remake of the film was announced in October 2006 as a co-production between film companies Rogue Pictures and Platinum Dunes. In December 2008, Platinum Dunes producer Bradley Fuller stated that the project had been put on hold due to similarities in conception with Twilight (2008), a film which also contained a romance between human and vampire characters.

It was the home of the St. Paul Saints from 1897 through 1956, when it was replaced by the first version of Midway Stadium. Lexington Park was commissioned by baseball owner Charlie Comiskey to serve as home for his St. Paul Saints Western League baseball franchise. In late 1899 the league changed its name to the American League in an ultimately successful bid to gain major league status. While the Saints were initially a member of that league, Comiskey moved his team to Chicago prior to Opening Day 1900 (where they still exist today as the Chicago White Sox). As such, the ballpark holds at least the technical distinction of being the original home to a current American League franchise‚Äîeven if, admittedly, the league wasn't major at the time, and not a single major league game was ever played there. Comiskey continued to own the ballpark for another decade or so (leasing it out to a replacement American Association club), until finally selling it to local interests in 1909. It was on the block bounded by Lexington Parkway, University Avenue, Fuller and Dunlap. Home plate was originally in the southwest corner of the block. Following a fire in November, 1915, a steel and concrete grandstand was built with the plate repositioned to the northwest corner. Lights were installed in 1937. The first night game was played on July 15, with the Saints hosting the arch-rival Minneapolis Millers. The teams played again the next night, at Nicollet Park's first night game. The 6-decades-old ballpark did not quite go out in a wave of euphoria the way its Twin Cities cousin Nicollet Park did, but the Saints did manage to defeat the Minneapolis Millers in the final game. Although demolished in the 1950s, elements of the park remain in existence to this day. A significant segment of the southwestern foundation can still be seen by the knowledgeable observer, and as late as the 1990s a grocery store on the site (since demolished) preserved the location of Lexington's home plate with a distinctively-shaped commemorative floor tile. The area is currently being redeveloped. An Aldi grocery store is one of the most recent additions to the site. According to Stew Thornley's 2006 book, a plaque that had once been affixed to the grocery store is now reinstated, at the TCF Bank branch building.

A Manual of Spherical and Practical Astronomy V. II. 1863. Reprint of 1891. 5th ed. Dover, N.Y.: 1960. pp. 474‚Äì566.) is a means of assessing whether one piece of experimental data -- an outlier -- from a set of observations, is likely to be spurious. Derivation The idea behind Chauvenet's criterion is to find a probability band, centered on the mean of a normal distribution, that should reasonably contain all n samples of a data set. By doing this, any data points from the n samples that lie outside this probability band can be considered to be outliers, removed from the data set, and a new mean and standard deviation based on the remaining values and new sample size can be calculated. This identification of the outliers will be achieved by finding the number of standard deviations that correspond to the bounds of the probability band around the mean (D_{\\\\mathrm{max}}) and comparing that value to the absolute value of the difference between the suspected outliers and the mean divided by the sample standard deviation (Eq.1). \\\\ge \\\\frac{x - \\\\bar x}{s_x}}} where * D_{\\\\mathrm{max}} is the maximum allowable deviation, *  \\\\cdot  is the absolute value, * x is the value of suspected outlier, * \\\\bar x is sample mean, and * s_x is sample standard deviation. In order to be considered as including all n observations in the sample, the probability band (centered on the mean) must only account for n-\\\\tfrac12 samples (if n=3 then only 2.5 of the samples must be accounted for in the probability band). In reality we cannot have partial samples so n-\\\\tfrac12 (2.5 for n=3) is approximately n. Anything less than n-\\\\tfrac12 is approximately n-1 (2 if n=3) and is not valid because we want to find the probability band that contains n observations, not n-1 samples. In short, we are looking for the probability, P, that is equal to n-\\\\tfrac12 out of n samples (Eq.2). where * P is the probability band centered on the sample mean and * n is the sample size. The quantity \\\\tfrac1{2n} corresponds to the combined probability represented by the two tails of the normal distribution that fall outside of the probability band P. In order to find the standard deviation level associated with P, only the probability of one of the tails of the normal distribution needs to be analyzed due to its symmetry (Eq.3). where * P_z is probability represented by one tail of the normal distribution and * n = sample size. Eq.1 is analogous to the Z-score equation (Eq.4). where * Z is the Z-score, * x is the sample value, * \\\\mu=0 is the mean of standard normal distribution, and * \\\\sigma=1 is the standard deviation of standard normal distribution. Based on Eq.4, to find the D_{\\\\mathrm{max}} (Eq.1) find the z-score corresponding to P_z in a Z-score table. D_{\\\\mathrm{max}} is equal to the score for P_z. Using this method D_{\\\\mathrm{max}} can be determined for any sample size. In Excel, D_{\\\\mathrm{max}} can be found with the following formula: =ABS(NORM.S.INV(1/(4n))). Calculation To apply Chauvenet's criterion, first calculate the mean and standard deviation of the observed data. Based on how much the suspect datum differs from the mean, use the normal distribution function (or a table thereof) to determine the probability that a given data point will be at the value of the suspect data point. Multiply this probability by the number of data points taken. If the result is less than 0.5, the suspicious data point may be discarded, i.e., a reading may be rejected if the probability of obtaining the particular deviation from the mean is less than \\\\tfrac1{2n}. Example For instance, suppose a value is measured experimentally in several trials as 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, and 50. The mean is 16.7 and the standard deviation 16.34. 50 differs from 16.7 by 33.3, slightly more than two standard deviations. The probability of taking data more than two standard deviations from the mean is roughly 0.05. Six measurements were taken, so the statistic value (data size multiplied by the probability) is 0.05√ó6 = 0.3. Because 0.3 < 0.5, according to Chauvenet's criterion, the measured value of 50 should be discarded (leaving a new mean of 10, with standard deviation 0.7). Peirce's criterion Another method for eliminating spurious data is called Peirce's criterion. It was developed a few years before Chauvenet's criterion was published, and it is a more rigorous approach to the rational deletion of outlier data.Ross, PhD, Stephen (2003). University of New Haven article. J. Engr. Technology, Fall 2003. Retrieved from http://newton.newhaven.edu/sross/piercescriterion.pdf. Other methods such as Grubbs's test for outliers are mentioned under the listing for Outlier. Criticism Deletion of outlier data is a controversial practice frowned on by many scientists and science instructors; while Chauvenet's criterion provides an objective and quantitative method for data rejection, it does not make the practice more scientifically or methodologically sound, especially in small sets or where a normal distribution cannot be assumed. Rejection of outliers is more acceptable in areas of practice where the underlying model of the process being measured and the usual distribution of measurement error are confidently known.

The Model 70 was originally manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company between 1936 and 1980. From the early 1980s until 2006, Winchester rifles were manufactured by U.S. Repeating Arms under an agreement with Olin Corporation, allowing USRA to use the Winchester name and logo.Hawks, Chuck. \\"The Rifleman's Rifle: Winchester's Model 70\\", Chuck Hawks' Web site. Accessed June 11, 2008. Model 70s were built in New Haven, Connecticut, from 1936 to 2006, when production ceased. In the fall of 2007, the Belgian company FN Herstal announced that Model 70 production would resume. As of 2012, new Winchester Model 70 rifles were being made by FN Herstal in Columbia, South Carolina. In 2013, assembly was moved to Portugal. The Model 70 In 1936, Winchester introduced the Model 70 bolt-action rifle to the American market. The Model 70 was largely based on the Model 54, and is today still highly regarded by shooters and is often called \\"The Rifleman's Rifle\\". In 1999 Shooting Times magazine named the Model 70 the \\"Bolt-action Rifle of the Century\\". Throughout its life, the Model 70 has been offered in many grades and styles. Over the entire production of the Model 70, chamberings have included: .22 Hornet, .222 Remington, .223 Remington, .22-250 Remington, .223 WSSM, .225 Winchester, .220 Swift, .243 Winchester, .243 WSSM, .250-3000 Savage, .257 Roberts, .25-06 Remington, .25 WSSM, 6.5√ó55mm, .264 Winchester Magnum, 6.5mm Creedmoor, .270 Winchester, .270 WSM, .270 Weatherby Magnum, .280 Remington, 7mm Mauser, 7mm-08, 7 mm Remington Magnum, 7mm WSM, 7mm STW, .300 Savage, .30-06 Springfield, .308 Winchester, .300 H&H; Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum, .300 WSM, .300 Weatherby Magnum, .300 RUM, .325 WSM, .338 Winchester Magnum, .35 Remington, .358 Winchester, .375 H&H; Magnum, .416 Remington Magnum, .416 Rigby, .458 Winchester Magnum, and .470 Capstick, and 9x57mm Mauser. 1936 through 1963 Model 70 The pre-1964 Model 70s were manufactured from 1936 through 1963 after which time significant changes in the design and manufacture of the rifles were made. Pre-1964 Model 70s bring a substantial price premium due to a public perception that they were better, as they had several desirable features (Mauser-type controlled round feed, cut checkering) that the post-1964 version did not. The best way to identify a pre-1964 Model 70 Winchester rifles is the serial number and the fore-end screw to secure the barrel to the stock.Barsness, John. \\"Shooting 70 Years of Model 70s\\", American Rifleman. Model 70 rifles with serial numbers below 700,000p245 Bolt Action Rifles by Frank de Haas, DBI Books INC, Northfield ILL, USA, 1971, are the pre-1964 variety. The receivers of these Model 70s were machined from bar stock steel. =Pre-1964 Model 70 action (controlled round feed)= The original Model 70 quickly established an excellent reputation with American sportsmen. It was a high-quality action of considerable strength, with two forward locking lugs and a Mauser-type non-rotating claw extractor. The key benefit of the Mauser-type extractor compared to later versions is that it more positively extracts the spent casing. This feature is often referred to as \\"controlled round feeding\\" (CRF) because the extractor captures the rim of a cartridge as it is fed upwards from the magazine and controls its journey forward into the rifle's chamber. Later designs referred to as \\"push feed,\\" only capture the cartridge by the magazine lips and the chamber and the cartridge is not held to the bolt face until a spring-loaded extractor is pushed over the cartridge's extractor groove. The smaller extractor of the push feed action may slip or break off a spent casing stuck in the chamber under adverse conditions. Therefore the more positive extraction of the controlled round feeding action is favored by some shooters, especially those who pursue dangerous game, who require rifles to extract reliably. This function is necessary to allow subsequent cartridges to be fed and fired in a bolt-action rifle with only a single barrel. The ejector on the original Model 70 was of the blade type similar to that of the Mauser 98, but considered superior as it did not require a Mauser-type slot through the left locking lug; instead, there was a slot in the bolt face below the locking lug, leaving both forward lugs solid and hence stronger. The main benefit of the blade type ejector is it is simpler and perhaps more reliable (being considered less susceptible to ingress of foreign matter) when compared to the later post-1964 plunger ejector in the bolt face controlled by a coil spring. Other significant features of this action include a three-position wing-type safety (retained throughout Model 70 production), a cone breeching-system that helps prevent bullet-nose damage while loading a cartridge from the magazine, machined steel trigger-guard and floor plate, one-piece bolt construction, and a trigger adjustable for pull weight and over-travel.  1964 through 1992 Model 70  Competing as it did with the Remington Model 700, it was decided that changes needed to be made in the face of rising labour costs. Accordingly, in 1964 Winchester made a number of design changes to the Model 70. Few to none of these changes were popular with the rifle-buying public, or with the US military. The changes included dropping the controlled round feed feature, a change to the basic stock shape and the use of impressed checkering rather than cut checkering. Jack O'Connor, long a proponent of the Model 70, wrote of the post-1964 version that \\"I was informed by Winchester brass that the Model 70 was being redesigned. I told them that I was glad to get the information so I could lay in four or five more before they loused the rifle up. Then I saw the pilot model of 'New Model 70.' At the first glimpse I like to fell into a swoon. The action was simplified, the trigger guard and floor plate made of a flimsy looking one-piece stamping.\\" Despite this initial reaction, O'Connor grudgingly went on to say, \\"Actually the post-1964 Model 70 is not a bad rifle in spite of the fact that rifle aficionados have never taken it to their bosoms the way they did its predecessor. It is a stronger action than the pre-1964. The head of the bolt encloses the head of the case. It has a small, neat hook extractor, which is adequate. With this extractor the cartridge is not as surely controlled as it is with the Mauser-type extractor. However, the new model seldom gives feeding problems.\\"Jack O'Connor, The Rifle Book, 3rd Edition, p. 57, Alfred A Knopf (1978). = Post-1964 Model 70 action (push feed) = In order to reduce manufacturing costs in the face of higher labour rates, rifles manufactured from 1964 to 1992 differed from early Model 70s in the following ways: * The receiver, for the first time, and from here on out, was forged into shape, then machined. Heat treatment of the receiver was localized to the areas where necessary, namely the cams and locking lugs, to prevent warping caused by overall heat treatment. Forging the receiver increased its strength and reduced the machining labor and time needed to achieve the final shape.\\"The Bolt Action\\" Vol 1, Stuart Otteson * The bolt was changed significantly. The bolt face was enclosed so that it fully surrounded the cartridge rim, in a similar way to the Remington 700 bolt. While cheaper to manufacture than the undercut bolt face needed for controlled feed actions, it is also stronger, providing more support to the cartridge case head, and better contains escaping gases in the event of a case rupture. The new bolt also differed from the old in that it was manufactured in 2 pieces (bolt-handle/collar and the bolt bodyThe Bolt Action Vol 1, Stuart Otteson) and then brazed together. * The Mauser-inspired, non-rotating claw extractor (incompatible with a fully enclosed bolt head) was eliminated, and replaced with a small wedge-shaped extractor located within a lug of the bolt head. This type of extractor does not engage the cartridge rim as it rises from the magazine into the action, but rather clips over the cartridge rim after the cartridge has been pushed into the chamber and the bolt handle is turned down. This system is more vulnerable than the old system to jamming or being inadvertently closed on an empty breech (i.e., failing to load a new round) if operated under duress, especially if the rifle is held upside-down or on its side. In addition, the old extractor design served to stabilize the bolt while the action was open; without it, the new bolt did not have any such stabilization, and wobbled while fully open. This has since been fixed in later rifles, but it was nevertheless an obvious departure and certainly less elegant in function than the earlier models, which allowed the rifle to chamber cartridges smoothly from any position. * Barrels were now rifled by hammer forging, rather than the more costly process of being cut by hand. * The machined steel trigger guard and floor plate were replaced with parts stamped from an aluminium alloy to reduce weight using the assembly from the pre-1964 Featherweight version. * Some earlier models featured walnut stocks with checkering that was impressed onto the wood rather than cut into it as on the early Model 70s, further reducing manufacturing costs at the expense of a less positive grip on the rifle, particularly if the shooter is wearing gloves. Any Model 70 rifle made since that is not designated as a \\"Classic\\" model is likely to have this post-1964 action. In design terms (enclosed bolt face, plunger ejector, brazed bolt construction) the new action itself was comparable in design to the competing Remington Model 700, which has a worldwide following and is considered to be very reliable. When coupled with the other cost-cutting changes and compared with the previously produced and very familiar Model 70, however, it was immediately declared to be lacking. The new design of the rifle was swiftly and severely criticized by both gun writers and riflemen alike for its perceived lesser amount of control and feed issues, making the original action much more prized. The post-1964 action has been further improved over the years. Thanks to a refined bolt head design, the bolt is now less wobbly when open, and the action is now generally considered on par with the CRF action. Under normal conditions, the action's new design is no less reliable, and although the simplified construction is certainly less elegant, some of the changes could be considered improvements, having made the action stronger.p. 244 Bolt Action Rifles by Frank de Haas, DBI Books INC, Northfield ILL, USA, 1971, Also, the pressed checkering, one of the most reviled changes, was likewise done away with as soon as machine- cut checkering became available. All things considered, in normal situations there is now not much to choose between the two versions at present, apart from personal preference. 1968 Model 70 In 1968 further revisions were made to the Model 70 in part to address consumer concerns.p244 Bolt Action Rifles by Frank de Haas, DBI Books, Northfield ILL, USA, 1971, An \\"anti-bind\\" feature was introduced to make operation of the action smoother, which comprised a groove in an extended right locking lug operating on a rib on the right side of the receiver. This made the action noticeably smoother to operate and has been retained to the present day. A steel floorplate and stainless magazine follower were introduced, partially revoking changes introduced in the 1964 model. The alloy trigger guard was retained. 1992 to 2006 Model 70 Starting in 1992, Winchester re-introduced many features of the pre-1964 rifles, while also continuing to manufacture less-expensive variants. The post-1992 Model 70 is an extensive rifle line that boasts nearly all of the features of the original line, but with some updated equipment, such as the Controlled Round Push Feed action and synthetic stocks. The popular Shadow variants feature black resin stocks, which reduce the price of the firearm significantly, and hold up better than wood stocks over time. Some of the modern rifles also use high performance McMillan or Bell and Carlson fiberglass stocks, though these rifles tend to be expensive. Particular models feature a one-piece aluminum pillar block bedding for greater accuracy, and some models have fluting of the barrel to reduce weight and vent the barrel for additional cooling. Carbon fiber barrels are also found on select models to reduce weight and dissipate heat faster. Walnut stocks are still found across the line in satin finishes, and laminated walnut stocks are added to the mix for structural stability in extreme dry or wet conditions. The Model 70 is offered in all of the previous chamberings as the original, and is now supplemented with newer rounds, including the Winchester Short Magnum (WSM) and Winchester Super Short Magnum (WSSM) cartridges, which are magnum loaded rounds, but are shorter in length and wider in diameter, so spent cartridges take less time to eject and use less powder. However, these short magnum cartridges reduce magazine capacity and feeding reliability, due to their extra width and rebated rim. =Model 70 Classic= In 1992, Winchester began producing a controlled round feed Model 70 that was marketed as the \\"Classic\\" model. This version reintroduced the CRF feature, while retaining the \\"anti- bind\\" locking lug groove bolt guide of the 1968 push feed model. The use of modern CNC manufacturing techniques allowed Winchester to re-introduce the CRF feature at a competitive price. Around this time, Browning, which is owned by the same parent company as USRAC, Giat Corp, of France, introduced the BOSS accuracy system. The term 'BOSS' is an acronym for Ballistic Optimising Shooting System. The device attaches to the muzzle end of the barrel and allows the natural harmonics, commonly known as barrel whip, caused during the bullet's passage down the bore, to be refined and controlled. By adjusting the device for optimum performance in the individual rifle, accuracy is brought to peak level. Winchester Model 70s equipped with the BOSS provide a significant improvement in accuracy for a production rifle. Currently, only Browning rifles are available with the BOSS. Later, Winchester expanded the Classic line, putting the Classic action on all their modern stocks, giving a wide range of choice in rifle types. This basically lets the buyer choose an action, then choose a stock to one's liking. Both pre- and post-1964 versions of the Model 70 actions have their strengths and weaknesses.  1992 Classic Model (Controlled Round Feed and Controlled Round Push Feed)  At the same time as the CRF feature was re-introduced, a recent innovation allowed the short extractor used on the post-1964 models to ride over the extraction groove on a cartridge, giving controlled feeding without the expense of the long Mauser type extractor. This was called Controlled Round Push Feed. This is achieved by the use of the pre-1964 extractor, combined with the post-1964 bolt face relieved at the bottom allowing the round to engage the bolt face from underneath.  2006‚Äìpresent Model 70  Winchester Model 70 Super Grade 2012 model chambered for .30-06 Springfield. Two-piece scope mount. On March 31, 2006, U.S. Repeating Arms closed the New Haven, Conn. plant where Winchester rifles and shotguns were produced for 140 years. This resulted in hiatus of the production of the Winchester Model 70 rifle and Winchester Model 1300 pump-action shotgun and the end of the Model 94 lever-action rifle. Other Winchester models however, are still produced in other regions such as Asia and Europe. On August 15, 2006, Olin Corporation, owner of the Winchester trademarks, announced that it had entered into a new license agreement with Browning to make Winchester brand rifles and shotguns, though not at the closed Winchester plant in New Haven. Browning, based in Morgan, Utah, and the former licensee, U.S. Repeating Arms Company, are both subsidiaries of FN Herstal. In October 2007, FN Herstal announced that it would produce Controlled Round Feed Winchester Model 70 rifles at its facility in Columbia, South Carolina, where it currently manufactures the M240, M249, and M16 for the United States military, as well as its SPR and PBR lines, which are, in fact, variants of the modern Model 70 Controlled Round Feed rifles. In 2013, FN/Browning relocated Model 70 assembly to Portugal. As of 2015, Model 70 rifles are stamped, \\"Imported by BACO, Inc., Morgan, Utah ‚Äì Made in Portugal by Browning Viana\\".  Law enforcement use  The Winchester Model 70 series rifles are marketed as sniper rifles for military forces and law enforcement agencies under the Fabrique Nationale banner as the Special Police Rifle (SPR) and the Patrol Bolt Rifle (PBR). The FN Special Police Rifle has the standard Winchester Model 70 rifle action, receiver and magazine system but the rifle is fitted with a heavier barrel and with the McMillan series tactical rifle stocks. The FN Patrol Bolt Rifle has the standard features of the original Winchester Model 70 rifle but the rifle is designed for use by police officers in patrol cars with the rifle having a short and compact barrel so it would allow the rifle to be stored in a police car. The FN Patrol Bolt Rifle is also marketed with a compensator on the muzzle of the rifle's barrel.  Military use  The United States Marine Corps purchased 373 Model 70 rifles in May, 1942. Although the Marine Corps officially used only the M1 Garand and the M1903 Springfield as sniper rifles during the Second World War, \\"many Winchester Model 70s showed up at training camps and in actual field use during the Pacific campaign.\\"Lanning, Michael Lee. (1998). Inside the Crosshairs: Snipers in Vietnam. New York: Ballantine Books. p. 59. . These rifles had shorter 24-inch barrels chambered for .30-06 Springfield. They were serial numbered in the 41000 to 50000 range and were fitted with leaf sights and checkered stocks with steel butt plates, one-inch sling swivels, and leather slings. It has been reported that some of these rifles were equipped with 8X Unertl telescopic sights for limited unofficial use as sniper weapons on Guadalcanal and during the Korean War. Many of the surviving rifles, after reconditioning with heavier Douglas barrels and new stocks between 1956 and 1963 at the Marine Corps match rebuild shop in Albany, Georgia, were fitted with 8√ó Unertl sights from M1903A1 sniper rifles. The reconditioned rifles were used in competitive shooting matches; and the United States Army purchased approximately 200 new Model 70 National Match Rifles with medium heavy barrels for match use between 1954 and 1957. Many of the reconditioned Marine Corps match rifles were used by Marine Corps snipers during the early years of the Vietnam war with M72 match ammunition loaded with 173-grain boat- tailed bullets. A smaller number of the Army's Model 70 rifles also saw combat use by Army snipers; and some were equipped with silencers for covert operations in Southeast Asia. These Model 70 rifles never achieved the status of a standard military weapon; but were used until replaced by the Remington Model 700 series bolt-action rifles which became the basis for the M40 series sniper rifle.Canfield, Bruce N. American Rifleman (April 2011) pp.66‚Äì85 One of the reasons the U.S. Marine Corps replaced their Winchester Model 70s was that the post-1964 variants of the Model 70 did not meet U.S. Marines' standards. Despite the introduction of the Remington Model 700 rifle, the pre-1964 Winchester Model 70 was still used by the US Marine Corps' scout/sniper teams during the Vietnam War alongside the Remington Model 700 rifle. The original wood stocks were found to be warping in both rifles after a few years of service and both rifles were given fiberglass stocks to remedy the problem.Senich, Peter R. (1988). Complete Book of U.S. Sniping. Boulder, CO: Paladin Press. p. 288. . Existing Model 70s still in service have had their stocks replaced with a McMillan fiberglass stock, such as that found on the Custom Extreme Weather variant. One of the best known U.S. Marine Corps snipers who used the Winchester Model 70 during the Vietnam War was Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock, who used a Winchester Model 70 sniper rifle chambered in .30-06. It was this rifle, equipped with a standard 8√ó43 Unertl scope, that Hathcock used to kill a North Vietnamese enemy sniper by shooting him in the eye, through the scope of his Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle. Hathcock's rifle is on display at the Quantico, Virginia Marine Corps Sniper Museum.

It indirectly connects Duluth to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and passes through the cities of St. Cloud, Willmar, and Marshall. MN 23 runs north from its interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90), east of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and then continues north and east across Minnesota to its terminus at its interchange with I-35 in Duluth.

Portions of MN 23 that have been upgraded to a four-lane expressway include approximately in the Marshall area in addition to longer stretches between Willmar and New London, and between Richmond and Waite Park (St. Cloud). For a majority of the Willmar area, Highway 23 runs concurrently with U.S. Highway 71 (US 71), which includes a freeway bypass of the city. MN 23 crosses the Minnesota River at Granite Falls, and the Mississippi River in St. Cloud, over the Granite City Crossing bridge.

At 133rd Avenue West, along the southern edge of Duluth, MN 23 crosses the Saint Louis River into Douglas County, Wisconsin, in the Town of Superior, for before re-entering Minnesota.Wisconsin Department of Transportation, Douglas County On some maps, this section is designated \\"WISC-23\\", despite there being another Highway 23 in southern Wisconsin. There is no signage, however, along the highway that indicates the brief route across state lines. Nearby is the junction between MN 23 and MN 210 and Jay Cooke State Park. History MN 23 was authorized November 2, 1920 from Paynesville to Mission Creek, south of Hinckley. By 1933, the highway was paved between Roscoe and Cold Spring and from St. Cloud to Mission Creek. It was extended west to Benson and east to Duluth in 1934. Various sections of the highway were paved from the 1930s through the 1950s; the entire length was paved by 1961. The section of present-day MN 23 from its southern terminus to Marshall was originally designated MN 39 until 1940. The section between Marshall and Willmar was originally designated MN 17 until 1940. The MN 23 designation originally extended west from New London to Benson along the modern MN 9; which was also MN 17 from around 1940 to the 1960s. MN 23 originally ran through Sandstone proper to just west of Askov along the route that later became MN 123; this was redesignated 1946. From 1934 to 1963, the northern terminus for MN 23 was its junction with old US 61 and US 2 in West Duluth. From 1963 to 1997, MN 23 continued farther into Duluth proper as a business route using several local arteries including Michigan Street, West 1st Street, East 2nd Street, East 3rd Street, and East Superior Street. The former northern terminus for MN 23 during this time period was at the intersection of US 61 (now MN 61) and 60th Avenue East in Duluth. In 1997, the official northern terminus changed to its junction with I-35 at Grand Avenue in Duluth. After completion of the I-35 freeway, the state maintained MN 23 through Hinckley and Sandstone; now MN 23 is concurrent with I-35 from Hinckley to Sandstone. The four-lane US 71 / MN 23 bypass of Willmar was proposed in the 1960s. However a financial crisis in the early 1980s led to the northbound lanes being unpaved, and the bypass had been scaled down to a two-lane facility by the time it opened in 1985. Construction in 2001 completed the bypass to its original four-lane design. The MN 23 expressway from Spicer to New London, and the expressway from Richmond to Waite Park (St. Cloud), were both completed by 2005. The DeSoto Bridge across the Mississippi River in St. Cloud was closed on March 20, 2008, after bent gusset plates were found in an inspection; similar to gusset plates that caused the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis to collapse on August 1, 2007. The DeSoto Bridge was demolished in October 2008; with a new replacement bridge, the Granite City Crossing, completed October 29, 2009. Future MnDOT has designated MN 23 as a medium-priority Interregional Corridor along the majority of its length. As such, there are long-range plans to expand significant portions of the highway from two to four lanes. The ultimate vision for MN 23 is a four-lane expressway running from its interchange with I-90 in the southwest corner of Minnesota northeastward to its interchange with I-35 near Hinckley, although severe funding shortages are currently limiting expansion to certain segments. Currently, the section of highway that has the highest overall priority for expansion is the corridor between Willmar and St. Cloud. This is due in part to the corridor carrying a heavy volume of traffic (higher than what a standard two-lane highway is designed to safely carry), plus a subsequently higher-than-average accident rate. In addition, southwest Minnesota lacks four-lane access to both the Twin Cities (Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul) and the Interstate Highway System, and a MN 23 expressway from Willmar (which is the largest municipality in southwest Minnesota) to St. Cloud would greatly alleviate both these issues. Originally, there were only two short stretches of four-lane along this segment of MN 23: its route through St. Cloud (also known as Division Street) on the northern end, and its concurrency with US 71 in the Willmar area on the southern end. However, additional portions of this segment have been expanded to four lanes in the last decade‚Äîmost notably, from its concurrency with US 71 to New London, and from Richmond to its interchange with I-94/US 52 near St. Cloud. In addition, a new bypass around Paynesville is now open. The Paynesville Bypass project began on April 26, 2010. The project consists of constructing a four-lane bypass around Paynesville, running from Kandiyohi County Road 6 to Stearns County Road 123. The three-year project is expected to be completed in August 2012. The length of the new bypass is . The project includes grading, construction of eight bridges, surfacing and lighting. The 2010 cost of the bypass is $32.2 million. Another project expanded MN 23 to four lanes from St. Cloud eastward to Foley, which began July 1, 2011, and finished sometime in late 2012. This project expanded an segment of the highway. While this section is technically part of the St. Cloud-to-I-35 portion of the corridor (and thus has less overall priority), the increase in traffic along this particular stretch still necessitates and warrants expansion, as there have been major safety and mobility issues the last couple decades due to growth in the St. Cloud area. The highway between St Cloud and Willmar is of importance because it connects Willmar to I-94 and beyond. The state has planned to make MN 23 a complete four-lane highway all the way between Willmar and Foley. MnDOT has started to purchase property in 2019 and will continue until 2021. Construction on the gaps will start in 2022 and into 2023.

Offenhauser, Jr. (November 11, 1888 ‚Äì August 17, 1973), was an American automotive engineer and mechanic who developed the Offenhauser racing engine, nicknamed the \\"Offy\\", which dominated competition in the Indianapolis 500 race for decades. He also built the Novi engine, which was designed by Bud Winfield and Leo Goossen. Biography Frederick Offenhauser, Jr., was born November 11, 1888 in Los Angeles, California, the oldest child of Martha and Frederick Offenhauser. Both his parents were natives of Germany who had immigrated as young adults. His father worked as a barber. Offenhauser, Jr. married Ethel C. Lowery. In 1913, when he was 25, Offenhauser began working in the shop of Harry Arminius Miller. That year a Peugeot Grand Prix car won the Indianapolis 500. It was equipped with a state-of-the-art double overhead cam, four valve per cylinder engine. Miller named Offenhauser as the head of his engine department in 1914. Bob Burman was campaigning the Peugeot engine that year, but when World War I made it impossible to get parts, Miller's shop got the job of maintaining it. The design so impressed Miller and Offenhauser that they designed an engine on largely similar principles. In 1917, Offenhauser designed and built Barney Oldfield's famous \\"Golden Submarine\\". In 1919, Leo Goossen joined Miller's shop, and Offenhauser became plant manager. Miller's company went bankrupt in 1933 during the Great Depression. Offenhauser bought the patterns and equipment from Miller, and began developing a new engine with Goossen.Biography at the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame What became known as the Offenhauser engine was driven to great success in roadsters at the Indianapolis 500, with 24 victories in 27 years. Offenhauser did not frequently attend the races at Indianapolis. In 1934, Offenhauser built his first 97-cubic inch-engine for midget car racing. Curly Mills was the first to win with this engine in his car. By 1941 Offenhauser's shop in Novi, Michigan, had developed the Novi engine, designed by Goossen and Bud Winfield. It was first promoted under the Winfield name. With additional development, it was used on racing cars in the Indianapolis 500 from 1941 to 1966. In 1946 Offenhauser sold his business to Louis Meyer and Dale Drake. Meyer and Drake continued producing the motor using the Offenhauser name. Offenhauser died August 17, 1973, in Los Angeles, California. He was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

It is a member of the Colorado State University System (CSU System) and is a federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). History Colorado State University Pueblo has evolved from a three-room junior college on the third floor of the Pueblo County Courthouse with 63 students and two (2) instructors to a regional comprehensive university offering 29 baccalaureate and six master's degree programs, serving more than 5,000 students from all 50 states and 23 countries. Currently, CSU Pueblo is also ranked in the top 100 for best regional western universities. Over the past 75 years under four different names, the institution has graduated more than 35,000 students from 41 states and 32 countries. Today, more than 14,000 graduates live in Colorado. =1933 to 1959= The idea for starting a college in Pueblo was initially proposed in 1926, when a bill was put before the state Senate to begin a four-year school in the city. The bill was defeated by one vote. In the years following the Great Depression, the idea for a college in Pueblo was revived through the efforts of a local school teacher at Centennial High School, Eric T. Kelly. At the time, Pueblo's primary employer, steelmaker Colorado Fuel & Iron Corp., was no longer hiring, drought and dust storms were plaguing all of Southern Colorado and the city still was trying to recover from the devastating floods of 1921. Kelly organized a committee that was composed of several local business leaders to discuss the possibility of getting a college started, among them Frank Hoag, Jr., publisher of The Pueblo Chieftain and Star-Journal newspapers, Dr. C.N. Caldwell and J. Arthur Phelps. The school originally was planned to be named San Isabel Junior College, but by the time the school had received incorporation it was changed to Southern Colorado Junior College (SCJC). The name change was made in an effort to broaden the recruitment area for the college. The first classes at SCJC were held in the fall of 1933 in three vacant rooms on the third-floor of the Pueblo County Courthouse. Sixty-three students (31 full-time and 32 part-time) enrolled and the staff consisted of two full-time and eight part-time instructors, a registrar and Kelly, who agreed to serve as the dean of students, of that first class of students, 17 would earn a degree with the first graduating class of 1935. By 1935, the school's enrollment was steadily increasing, and the need to find a permanent location was imminent. With land donated by the CF&I; and local money from the City Federation of Women's Club and the Works Progress Administration, construction of the college's first building‚Äîa arts building‚Äîbegan in 1936. The property donated for the college was bordered by the Bessemer ditch, Marilyn Place, Orman Avenue and the alley at Orman and Arthur and became known as the Orman campus. Kelly gave up his position as dean in 1936, and L.R.Wren took over as president and served in that position until 1939. A year later, Pueblo County residents formed the Pueblo County Junior College District, which allowed for the college to receive tax dollars. =Name changes= The university has operated under five different names: 1933: Southern Colorado Junior College (SCJC) Southern Colorado Junior College provided two years of college instruction in the arts, literature, and science, adult education and vocational opportunities, and coursework to complete a high school program. 1937: Pueblo Junior College (PJC) Taking advantage of the Junior College Act of the General Assembly, the Pueblo County Junior College District was formed, making the college part of the public school system supported by county-wide taxes. The name change to Pueblo Junior College brought with it a change in mission. The institution offered the first two years of general study at the college level, providing the educational foundation for students seeking to transfer to complete their higher education degrees at four-year colleges and universities, and continued to offer a range of practical courses for those not seeking a higher education degree. 1961: Southern Colorado State College (SCSC) The 30th anniversary year saw the State enact legislation making the institution a four-year degree granting college and a member of the state system of higher education. The first juniors were enrolled in 1963, followed in 1964 by the first seniors and the first bachelor's degrees awarded in 1965. The name change to Southern Colorado State College reflected recognition of the need for more advanced degrees and an increase in the number of students pursuing a four-year degree in the southeastern region of Colorado. In 1964, Colorado State Senator Vincent Massari led the college's push to become a four-year university. Senator Massari was instrumental in obtaining funds for a new campus in the Belmont area of Pueblo, moving from the old junior college campus on Orman Avenue. 1975: University of Southern Colorado (USC) As the demand for higher education programs increased, the number of academic degrees offered at the undergraduate and graduate levels increased. The first graduate program to be offered was the Master of Arts in Teaching with an emphasis in industrial education beginning in 1972. The institution was granted university status and renamed the University of Southern Colorado. It was designated as Colorado's only polytechnic university. In 1985, USC was integrated into the newly created Colorado State University System (CSU System) with Colorado State University, Colorado's land-grant university, and Fort Lewis College. In 2002, Fort Lewis College chose to be a separate entity. 2003: Colorado State University Pueblo (CSU Pueblo) The University's welcome sign. With its long history of collaboration with Colorado State University (CSU) and being a Colorado State University System (CSU System) member since 1985, eventually a name change was forthcoming. Also, an independent study of Higher Education in Colorado recommended to change the university's name to reflect the unique relationship with CSU. In May 2002, Governor Bill Owens signed legislation changing the institution's mission and name to Colorado State University Pueblo effective July 1, 2003. Today, the university has a focus on professional studies such as business, nursing, social work, teacher education, and liberal arts. =Federal designation and awards= In 2002, CSU Pueblo was designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution by the United States Department of Education. In 2008, CSU Pueblo was awarded the Outstanding HACU- Member Institution Award by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. In 2015, the university won the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) and Solution Generation Leadership in Climate Change Award. =Birth of the ThunderWolves= Prior to the 1995‚Äì96 academic school year, the University of Southern Colorado (now Colorado State University Pueblo) adopted the \\"ThunderWolf\\" as its mascot. The ThunderWolf came to life as USC looked to modernize its image following more than 60 years as the \\"Indians.\\" The original ThunderWolf logo was put into place prior to the 1995‚Äì96 school year. Designed to elicit fear and reverence, the original logo contained a detailed head of a ThunderWolf with a mountain range in the background. After a few years of use, the logo was eventually scrapped for a more easily reproduced logo that contained the letters \\"USC\\". The logo remained in use until the University of Southern Colorado changed its name prior to the 2003‚Äì04 school year to Colorado State University Pueblo. Campus CSU Pueblo is located north of CO-47 in Pueblo, Colorado, a city of approximately 106,000 residents located in the Pikes Peak region of southern Colorado. The university's main campus is located in the Belmont area of northern Pueblo. The original 850-acre land was donated to build the campus. In 1985, the university determined that the current campus and anticipated growth could be accommodated on 275 acres. Over time the university has sold the excess property. To the northwest of campus sits the Walking Stick Golf Course. The campus architecture style was called \\"Modern Aztec\\" by the designers in 1963. The unique architecture of the buildings earned a national award by the American Institute of Architects. Most campus buildings reflect the International Style of the 1960s. Today, there are 18 buildings, numerous baseball and softball fields, a soccer/lacrosse complex, and the Neta & Eddie DeRose ThunderBowl. These include an administration building, student center, library, child care center and student recreation center which is adjacent to the university's primary athletic complex, Massari Arena. The campus began a major renovation in 2007, as renovations were made to Massari Arena and construction began on the new student recreation center, which was completed in time for the start of the 2008-09 academic year. In 2011, a multimillion- dollar renovation project was completed on the university's Library and Academic Resources Center (LARC) and a 1.2 megawatt solar array, as well as construction of three new residence halls (Culebra, Crestone, and Greenhorn). The LARC was LEED Platinum certified by the U.S. Green Building Council, the councils highest certification. The newly-renovated Occhiato Student Center opened in January 2018. Future plans include expanding the soccer facility to provide for more services and to allow the addition of a lacrosse program, as well as the demolition and reconstruction of the aging Belmont Residence Hall. Construction on the new academic building began in the summer of 2014, located just west of the Chemistry Building. OrganizationAdministration= The Board of Governors presides over the Colorado State University System (CSU System), which comprises Colorado State University, Colorado State University Pueblo and Colorado State University-Global Campus.

The athletics department supports 16 intercollegiate athletics programs. In 2007, the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System approved to bring back football, wrestling, and women's indoor and outdoor track & field. All three programs returned during the 2008‚Äì09 school year, and the football program, playing in the Neta & Eddie DeRose ThunderBowl, finished in the top 10 in the nation in attendance, averaging more than 8,000 fans per game during the 2008 season. In 2008‚Äì09, CSU Pueblo athletics programs won two Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference championships‚Äîin women's basketball (its third RMAC title in four seasons) and baseball (its first since 2004). The seven-year-old CSU Pueblo football team has won the title of Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference champions in the 2011-2014 seasons. In 2014, the football team won the NCAA Division II Championship, beating Minnesota State University, Mankato, 13-0. =Clubs and activities= CSU Pueblo features a cheerleading squad and dance team, club baseball, racquetball, climbing, rugby, and men's soccer. Since its establishment in 1996, the CSU Pueblo racquetball team has won 17 NCAA Division I championships (nine straight from 2004-2012).

In popular culture CSU Pueblo has a peripheral role in one of the most enduring urban legends in entertainment, specifically Van Halen's requirement in their technical rider that a bowl of M&M;'s, with all brown pieces removed, be present in their dressing room. Notably, media reports in the 1980s often claimed that the band had done more than $85,000 of damage to CSU Pueblo's Massari Arena after discovering brown M&M;'s backstage. The actual story, as told by David Lee Roth in his autobiography, was decidedly different. As background, Roth noted that the demand was added as a test of each venue's attention to detail after technical errors at smaller venues led to dangerous and even life-threatening situations. In Roth's telling of the CSU Pueblo incident, he admitted to having done about $12,000 of backstage damage after noticing brown M&M;'s, but indicated that over $80,000 of damage was done to the newly installed basketball floor because it could not support the band's extremely heavy staging.

Some countries have procedures by which the executive or legislative branches may certify important questions to the judiciary and obtain an advisory opinion. In other countries or specific jurisdictions, courts may be prohibited from issuing advisory opinions. International courtsInternational Court of Justice= The International Court of Justice is empowered to give advisory opinions under Chapter IV of its Statute (an annex to the United Nations Charter) when requested to do so by certain organs or agencies of the United Nations. These opinions are non-binding, but Pieter H.F. Bekker has argued that this non-binding character does not mean that advisory opinions are without legal effect, because the legal reasoning embodied in them reflects the Court's authoritative views on important issues of international law and, in arriving at them, the Court follows essentially the same rules and procedures that govern its binding judgments delivered in contentious cases submitted to it by sovereign states. In his view, an advisory opinion derives its status and authority from the fact that it is the official pronouncement of the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.The UN General Assembly Requests a World Court Advisory Opinion On Israel's Separation Barrier, Pieter H.F. Bekker, ASIL (American Society of International Law) Insights, December 2003. Advisory opinions have often been controversial, either because the questions asked were controversial, or because the case was pursued as a \\"backdoor\\" way of bringing what is really a contentious case before the Court. =Inter-American Court of Human Rights= The advisory function of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights enables it to respond to consultations submitted by agencies and member states of the Organization of American States regarding the interpretation of the American Convention on Human Rights or other instruments governing human rights in the Americas. It is also empowered to give advice on domestic laws and proposed legislation, and whether or not they are compatible with the Convention's provisions. *List of Advisory Opinions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. National courtsAustralia= The High Court of Australia is prohibited by the Constitution of Australia from issuing advisory opinions; a binding determination requires a controversy between two parties. Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts (1921) 29 CLR 257 at 265.Margaret Kelly, Administrative Law, Pearson Law Briefs. P36Leslie Zines, Cowen and Zines's Federal Jurisdiction in Australia p. 16. During certain episodes in Australia's legal history, such as the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, politicians have sometimes solicited informal advice from Justices of the High Court in their personal capacity. =Canada= Under Canadian law, the reference question mechanism is equivalent to an advisory opinion. The Supreme Court Act gives the federal Cabinet the power to refer questions to the Supreme Court of Canada on any questions of law.Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, s. 53. The Supreme Court then has jurisdiction to hold a hearing on the reference, just like an appeal. The Attorney General of Canada participates in a federal reference. The provincial and territorial Attorneys General have the right to intervene, and interested parties may apply to intervene. The parties make detailed written submissions to the Court, which then holds a hearing. It typically reserves its decision, later releasing a written opinion. The Court has a discretion to refuse to answer questions which are too ambiguous or will not provide an answer with any meaning. The Provincial governments and some of the territories have a similar power to refer questions to their highest appeal courts for an opinion. This power is set out in their respective provincial laws defining the powers of the appellate courts. The Supreme Court Act gives an automatic right of appeal from a reference decision of a provincial Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. =India= In India, the President of India can request the Supreme Court of India to provide its advice on certain matters. This procedure is called \\"Presidential Reference\\". According to Article 143 of the Constitution of India, the President of India may refer to the Supreme Court of India, a question of law or fact which, he thinks, is of public importance. However, it is not binding on the Supreme Court to answer questions raised in the reference. For a detailed analysis, please see the widely cited article authored by noted Indian lawyer: Mr. Deepaloke Chatterjee. =IrelandNauru= Article 55 of the Constitution of Nauru provides: \\"The President or a Minister may, in accordance with the approval of the Cabinet, refer to the Supreme Court for its opinion any question concerning the interpretation or effect of any provision of this Constitution which has arisen or appears to the Cabinet likely to arise, and the Supreme Court shall pronounce in open court its opinion on the question.\\"Constitution of Nauru This article has been put to use on six occasions, in the following cases, in which the Cabinet sought an advisory opinion from the Supreme Court on hypothetical cases relating to an interpretation of constitutional provisions: Three Questions Referred under Articles 36 & 55 of the Constitution (1977); Four Questions Referred under Article 55 of the Constitution (1977); Constitutional Reference; In re Article 55 of the Constitution (2003); Constitutional Reference; In re Dual Nationality and Other Questions (2004); In the Matter of Article 55 & 45 (and Article 36 & 40) of the Constitution (2007); and In the Matter of Article 55 & 45 (and Article 36 & 40) of the Constitution (2008).Selected case law of the Supreme Court of Nauru, Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute In Constitutional Reference; In re Dual Nationality and Other Questions (2004), Chief Justice Barry Connell made the following remarks in relation to the nature of article 55: :The referral provision in the Constitution is an unusual process, not always available under other written constitutions but, nevertheless, Article 55 has been used on a number of occasions in Nauru. It is unusual in that Courts will not normally exercise jurisdiction in a case without a justiciable matter. Courts normally will not conduct a case on a hypothetical question. However, under Article 55, the Court is enjoined to give an Opinion where Cabinet, and only Cabinet, desires an interpretation or effect of a provision of the Constitution where the question has arisen or appears to the Cabinet likely to arise [...]. :On account of the nature of Article 55, the Court must limit itself to the questions asked. Whilst the Court gives what is termed an Opinion, one must realise that it is a constitutional opinion based on law. Such an Opinion carries legal weight, so far as it goes, but it must itself be susceptible to the normal canons of interpretation in the event of a particular disputed question brought before the Court.Barry Connell CJ., Constitutional Reference; In re Dual Nationality and Other Questions (2004), Supreme Court of Nauru =Singapore United States=Federal courts The United States Supreme Court has determined that the case or controversy requirement found in Article Three of the United States Constitution prohibits United States federal courts from issuing advisory opinions. Accordingly, before the court will hear a case, it must find that the parties have a tangible interest at stake in the matter, the issue presented must be \\"mature for judicial resolution\\" or ripe, and a justiciable issue must remain before the court throughout the course of the lawsuit. While this doctrine is still in full force, there has been a liberalization of these requirements in recent years. In a letter to President George Washington, replying to the president's request for such an opinion, then-Chief Justice John Jay replied that it would violate the separation of powers for the Supreme Court to provide such an opinion, noting that the president could rely on advice from anyone within the executive branch under Article Two of the United States Constitution which expressly permits the President of the United States to \\"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\\" In other words, Jay informed President Washington that the President ought to turn to the Attorney General and perhaps other Cabinet secretaries when they require legal advice concerning American law. Over a century later the Court dismissed a case because there was no \\"actual controversy\\" between the parties; thus, any opinion rendered would be advisory.Muskrat v. United States, https://www.oyez.org/cases/1901-1939/1910/1910_330 State courts State courts are not subject to U.S. Constitution's Article III case or controversy limitation.Lucas Moench, State Court Advisory Opinions: Implications for Legislative Power and Prerogatives, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 2243, 2246 (2017) However, many state courts are barred from issuing advisory opinions by their own constitutions, although there are often specific exceptions to these limitations. Some states, like Rhode Island, permit the governor to certify questions on the constitutionality of laws to the state supreme court. Also, some states require their supreme court to give advisory opinions on particular matters, such as whether proposed amendments to the state constitution violate the U.S. Constitution. Statutory or constitutional provisions in Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and South Dakota allow their highest courts to issue advisory opinions in some circumstances.See RICHARD H. FALLON, JR. ET AL., HART AND WECHSLER'S THE FEDERAL COURTS AND THE FEDERAL SYSTEM 50-51 (7th ed. 2015). Several other states, including Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, and Vermont, once allowed for advisory opinions by statute or constitution, but have since abandoned the practice.Jonathan D. Persky, Note, ‚Äò‚ÄòGhosts that Slay‚Äù: A Contemporary Look at State Advisory Opinions, 37 CONN. L. REV. 1155, 1168-69 (2005). Advisory opinions should not be confused with certified questions by one court to another, which are permissible. U.S. federal courts, when confronted with real cases or controversies in which the federal court's decision will turn in whole or in part on a question of state law (e.g. diversity cases under the Erie doctrine or issues in which federal law incorporates state law by reference, such as exemptions in bankruptcy), occasionally ask the highest court of the relevant state to give an authoritative answer to the state-law question, which the federal court will then apply to its resolution of the federal case (see e.g. Pullman abstention). Because the state court in such circumstances is giving an opinion that affects an actual case, it is not considered to be issuing an advisory opinion.

The statute, along with its companion statute Quo Warranto also passed in 1290, was intended to remedy land ownership disputes and consequent financial difficulties that had resulted from the decline of the traditional feudal system in England during the High Middle Ages. The name Quia Emptores derives from the first two words of the statute in its original mediaeval Latin, which can be translated as \\"because the buyers\\". Its long title is A Statute of our Lord The King, concerning the Selling and Buying of Land. It is also cited as the Statute of Westminster III, one of many English and British statutes with that title. Prior to the passage of Quia Emptores, tenants could either subinfeudate their land to another, which would make the new tenant their vassal, or substitute it, which would sever the old tenant's ties to the land completely and substitute the new tenant for the old with regards to obligations to the immediate overlord concerned. Subinfeudation would prove problematic so was banned by the statute. By effectively ending the practice of subinfeudation, Quia Emptores hastened the end of feudalism in England, although it had already been on the decline for quite some time. Direct feudal obligations were increasingly being replaced by cash rents and outright sales of land which gave rise to the practice of livery and maintenance or bastard feudalism; the retention and control by the nobility of land, money, soldiers and servants via direct salaries; and land sales and rent payments. By the mid-fifteenth century the major nobility were able to assemble estates, sums of money and private armies on retainer through post-Quia Emptores land management practices and direct sales of land. It is thought by historians such as Charles Plummer that this would develop into one of the possible underlying causes of the Wars of the Roses. Other sources indicate the essence of bastard feudalism as early as the 11th century in the form of livery and maintenance, and that elements of classical feudalism are significant as late as the 15th century.*Hicks, Michael. Bastard Feudalism. London: Longman, 1995 the statute remains in force in England and Wales, albeit in highly amended form. It was repealed in the Republic of Ireland in 2009. It had an impact in colonial America and thereby the modern United States. Nomenclature Quia Emptores, translatable as \\"because of the buyers\\" and traditionally translated into English as \\"Forasmuch as the Purchasers\\", are the first two words of the statute in its mediaeval Latin. It is used in the statute to announce its intent and background, the \\"Purchasers\\" referring to subinfeudators whom the statute was trying to counteract. The statute is given the Latin title Statute qd null emat tras de aliis tenend qa de capitalibz dnis, &c.; on the Close Roll. It is known as the Statutum Westm. iij. The Statute of Westminster the Third, viz. of Quia Emptores Terrarum in the Printed Copies and Translations. In The Statutes of the Realm it is given the Latin title Statutu[m] d[omi]ni R[egis] de t[er]ris vendend[o] et emend[o], with a corresponding English title \\"A Statute of our Lord The King, concerning the Selling and Buying of Land\\". Its citation is 18 Edw 1 c 1. Background The Normans mandated primogeniture inheritance. Prior to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 the Anglo-Saxon law of land succession was customary. Land, or folkland as it was called, was held in allodial title by the group, meaning the group held the land. It was probably of little relevance when the titular head of the clan or family died. Traditional lands continued to be held in community by the group. The exact nature of allodialism as it existed in Anglo-Saxon England has been debated, but to no definitive end. On one side, it has been argued that in the mark system Saxon allodialism was a highly idealistic socialist/communitarian state. Countering this utopian view was Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges in his essay \\"The Origins of Property in Land\\", and Frederic William Maitland who found it to be inconsistent with extant Anglo-Saxon documents from pre-Norman times. After the Conquest the rule became one of primogeniture inheritance, meaning the eldest surviving son became the sole heir of the baronial estate. The intent of primogeniture inheritance was to keep large land holdings in the hands of a relatively few, trustworthy lords. The other sons could be accommodated by becoming under-lords to the surviving heir. The eldest would accept the younger brothers \\"in homage\\" in return for their allegiance. This was a process called subinfeudation. Even commoners could subinfeudate to their social inferiors. Large pieces of land were given to the great lords by the Norman Crown. Land title under William was a life tenure, meaning the land would pass back to the Crown upon the death of the lord. These lands were then subinfeudated to lesser lords.Plucknett, T, \\"Concise History of the Common Law\\", p. 712- 724, Little, Brown and Co. 1956 Landholdings in England were of this pattern: large land grants issued to the great lords by the Crown. These were divided up among the younger sons, who then subinfeudated them to lesser lords and commoners. These in turn \\"accepted in homage\\" their lessers who held even smaller parcels of land. Determining who owed what feudal incidences filled the court dockets for generations. With the passage of time, land tenures came to be inherited by the survivors of the great lords upon their deaths. Accompanying the Norman change in inheritance was a recognition of the ability of even the lowest of landholders the right of inheritance. In the 12th century, this custom was extended to the commoners. It was discovered that granting an interest in the passage of land to their children, commoners would tend the land with greater economy. The children of tenants were assured their inheritance in the land. This also meant, as a practicality, the land could be sold or bequeathed to the Church. The ancient method of the Normans was a grant to the Church in frankalmoin. In English law after the Conquest, the lord remained a grantor after the grant of an estate in fee-simple. There was no land in England without its lord: \\"\\" was the feudal maxim. These grants were in turn subject to subinfeudation. The principal incidents of a seignory were an oath of fealty, a quit or chief rent; a relief of one year's quit rent, and the right of escheat. In return, for these privileges the lord was liable to forfeit his rights if he neglected to protect and defend the tenant or did anything injurious to the feudal relation. The word \\"fee\\" is associated with the Norman feudal system and is in contradistinction to the Anglo-Saxon allodial system. At the time of the Conquest, William the Conqueror granted fiefs to his lords in the manner of a continental or feudal benefice which assured little beyond a life tenure. The English charters were careful to avoid saying the donee was to take the estate for life, or whether the heir was to have any rights. At this time, there is abundant evidence that lords refused to regrant on any terms to the deceased tenant's heirs; the deed phrase \\"to [A] and his heirs and assigns\\" is the product of efforts by purchasers to preserve such rights on behalf of those who might inherit or purchase the land from them. The practice of demanding a monetary payment for regranting of tenancy to the heirs quickly became the norm. In 1100, the Charter of Liberties of Henry I of England contained the clause: Relief later was set at a rate per fee in Magna Carta. By the time of Bracton, it was settled law that the word \\"fee\\" connoted inheritability and the maximum of legal ownership. =Magna Carta and the Great Charter of 1217= The Magna Carta of 1215 gave little mention of the rights of alienation. It contained 60 chapters, and represented the extreme form of baronial demands. John managed to receive a bull from Pope Innocent III annulling the Magna Carta. Magna Carta was effective law for about nine weeks. King John of England died shortly after that in 1216. The council which ruled in the name of the infant Henry III of England re-issued the charter in 1216, this time with papal assent. It was very much modified in favor of the Crown. The third Great Charter in 1217 is the first document of a legislative kind that expressly mentioned any restraint of alienation in favor of the lord.Plucknett, T. \\"Concise History of the Common Law\\", p. 22-23, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1956 It says: \\"No free man shall henceforth give or sell so much of his land as that out of the residue he may not sufficiently do to the lord of the fee the service which pertains to that fee.\\" Charter 1217, c. 39Coke, 2nd Inst. 65 It was determined during the minority rule of Henry III that the Crown should not be limited, hence the compromises seen in the Charters of 1216 and 1217. In 1225, Henry III came of age, and a fourth Great Charter was issued, which varied only slightly from the third Charter.Plucknett, p. 23, ibid. The charter deals with land law in Chapters 7, 32 and 36. The rights of widows were protected and landowners were forbidden to alienate so much of their land that the lord of the fee suffered detriment. Collusive gifts to the Church (which were frequently made in order to evade feudal service) were forbidden.Plucknett, p. 24, ibid. Coke interprets this as though its only effect was to make the excessive gift voidable by the donor's heir. It certainly could not be voided by the donor's lord.Charter, 1217, c. 39P & M, Vol . 1 p. 332, ibid. This opinion was reiterated by Bracton.Bracton, f. 169 b, Notebook pl. 1248 = Alienation by serfs and peasants = The use of land by tenants (serfs and peasants) was more difficult. Some families stayed on the land for generations. When the nominal head of the family died, it was usually of little consequence to the lord, or the owners of the title to the land. The practice of socage whereby the peasants pledged a payment (either in agricultural goods or money) for the privilege to inhabit and farm the land became the standard practice. After the payment, the peasant was considered \\"soked\\", that is, paid in full. It was discovered that agricultural land would be more economically tended if the peasants were assured an inheritance of the land to their descendants. This right to inherit was quickly followed by the right to alienation, i.e. the right to sell the inheritance to an outside party. Disputes arose when a family member wanted to leave inherited land to the Church, or wanted to sell the land to a third party. Questions concerning the rights of the overlord and the other family members were frequently heard in the courts prior to Quia Emptores. In general, it was held that a donor should pay the other parties who had an interest to give them relief. However, the results were haphazard and the rulings of various courts were patchwork, and there was little established stare decisis from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. This difficulty is illustrated in statements made by Ranulf de Glanvill (died 1190), the chief Justiciar of Henry II: It has been commented that this illustrates a desire in Glanvill's time to formalize the practices of the day, in which someone having a tenancy could dispose of his land before death. While several problems were addressed (land given in marriage, land given on a whim, or on a death bed), the rules were still vague, when compared to similar cases in contemporaneous France. In the latter, strict rules had arisen defining exact amounts which could be allotted in situations such as \\"alienation of one-third, or alienation of one-half\\" of a patrimony or conquest. Glanvill is imprecise, using terms such as \\"a reasonable amount\\" and \\"a certain part\\". The issue of alienation of serjeanty had been settled long before Quia Emptores. In 1198 the itinerant justices were directed to make an inquiry into the nature of the King's serjeanties. This was repeated in 1205 by King John who ordered the seizure of all Lancaster serjeanties, thegnages and dregnages that had been alienated since the time of Henry II of England. These could not be alienated without a royal licence. The Charter of 1217 reaffirmed this doctrine. Henry III of England issued an important ordinance in 1256. In it the King asserted that it was an intolerable invasion of royal rights that men should, without his special consent, enter, by way of purchase or otherwise, the baronies and fees that were holden to him in chief. Anyone who defied the decree was subject to seizure by the sheriff. Later case law indicates jurists remained largely ignorant of this decree, which suggests the Crown was reluctant to enforce it.Pollock and Maitland vol. 1, pp. 335‚Äì6 It became common practice to subinfeudate to the younger sons. There are cases from the time, in which a writ of the court was granted demanding that the eldest, inheriting son be forced to \\"accept in homage\\" the younger sons as a way of enforcing their subinfeudation. As there had been no survey of land titles since the Domesday Book over 200 years earlier, outright title to land had become seriously clouded in many cases and was often in dispute. The whole feudal structure was a patchwork of smaller land holders. Although the history of the major landholding lords is fairly well recorded, the nature of the smaller landholders has been difficult to reconstruct. Some direction toward order had been laid down in the Magna Carta, the Provisions of Oxford, and in the scanty legislation of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. Edward I set about to rationalize and modernize the law during his thirty-five year reign. The first period, from 1272 to 1290, consisted of the enactment of Statute of Westminster 1275 and the Statute of Gloucester (1278), and the incorporation of recently conquered Wales into the realm. These were followed by the Statute Quo Warranto and the Statute of Mortmain (1279). The latter was designed to stop the increasing amount of lands which were ending up in Church ownership. The Statute of Westminster 1285 contained the clause De Donis Conditionalibus which shaped the system of entailing estates. The Statute of Winchester was passed in 1285. This was followed by Quia Emptores (1290), which was only about 500 words in length. = Alienation prior to Quia Emptores = Buckfast Abbey as rebuilt. It originated on land donated by King Cnut in 1018, and became a Cistercian abbey in 1147. It is the opinion of Pollock and Maitland that in the middle of the 13th century the tenant enjoyed a large power of disposing of his tenement by act inter vivos, though this was subject to some restraints in favor of his lord.Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, Vol 1., p. 329, Cambridge University Press, 1968 Other opinions have been expressed. Coke regarded the English tradition as one of ancient liberty dictated by custom. The tenant had relative freedom to alienate all or part of his estate.Coke, 2nd Inst. 65; Co. Lit. 43a Blackstone was of a differing conclusion. The \\"learning of feuds\\" started with the inalienability of the fief as a starting point.Wright, Tenures, 154Gilbert, Tenures, p. 51‚Äì52Blackstone, Com. Ii, 71‚Äì72Pollock and Maitland, Vol 1, p. 329, ibid. Gradually, the powers of the tenant grew at the expense of the lord. Pollock and Maitland believe Coke's opinion to be the more valid one. Both views may have been true. Modern scholars may have given more weight to the written and declared law of the Normans than existed in reality.P & M, p. 129 ibid. For some time, two kinds of alienation had been occurring. These were \\"substitution\\" and \\"subinfeudation\\". In substitution, the tenant would alienate his land, and the attendant duties owed to the lord. After alienation, the tenant expected nothing from the new tenant, other than the price of the alienation. In subinfeudation, the new tenant would become a serf owing feudal duties to the person who alienated. The previous tenant would become the lord to the new tenant. Both these practices had the effect of denying the great lord of the land his rights of feudal estate. The bond of homage was between lord and servant. It was difficult for the medieval mind to think of this in any terms other than as a personal bond. The idea that a feudal bond could be bought or sold was repugnant to the ruling class. All the same, the practice of alienation of rights to the land had been going on in England for some centuries. A tenant who was accepted in homage by the lord could \\"subinfeudate\\" to one or more under-tenants. It was difficult or impossible for the overlord to extract any services (such as knight service, rent, homage) from the new tenants. They had no bond to the overlord. Pollock and Maitland give the following example: In the case of subinfeudation, the old tenant was liable for services to the lord. If A enfoeffed to B to hold a knight's service, and then B enfoeffed C to hold as a rent of a pound of pepper per year; B dies leaving an heir within age; A is entitled to a wardship; but it will be worth very little: instead of being entitled to enjoy the land itself until the heir is of age, he will get a few annual pounds of pepper. Instead of enjoying the land by escheat, he will only receive a trifling rent.Pollock and Maitland, p. 330-331, ibid. Quia Emptores in 1290 ended all subinfeudation and made all alienation complete. Once a sale of land was made, the new owner was responsible for all feudal incidents. =Glanvill on alienation= Glanvill gives no indication that a tenant needed the lord's consent to alienate his rights to land. He does speak at length of the rights of expectant heirs, and this should cause some restraints on alienation. He also says the rights of the lord must be considered. It can be inferred from Glanvill that no substitution could occur without the consent of the lord.Glanvill, vii. 1Dr. Brunner, Pol. Science Quarterly, xi. 339P & M p. 332, ibid. =Bracton on alienation= Bracton gives several examples of escheat occurring by a mesne lord (middle lord in the feudal structure): A enfeoffs B at a rent of 10 shillings. B enfeoffs C at a rent of 5 shillings. B dies without an heir. Is A entitled to 5, 10 or 15 shillings a year? While it can be argued that A is entitled to 15 shillings, it was Bracton's opinion that A should only be awarded 10 shillings.Bracton, f. 23, passage \\"addicio\\" Bracton held this problem to be without solution: Is A entitled to the wardship of C's heir, if C held of B in socage, and B, whose rights have escheated to A, and held of A by knight's service.Bracton, f.48 The worst case occurred when the tenant made a gift of frankalmoin ‚Äì a gift of land to the Church. A wardship would be of no value at all. An escheat of the land (a reclamation of the land by the overlord) would allow the owner to take control of the land. But the act of placing the land in frankalmoin left it in the hands of a group of lawyers or others who allowed the use of the land by a Church organization. The overlord would have nominal control of the corporation which had never entered into a feudal homage arrangement. The corporation owed nothing to the overlord. Bracton was sympathetic to this arrangement. According to him the lord is not really injured. His rights to the land remain unscathed. It is true they have been significantly diminished. He had suffered damnum, but there had been no iniuria.Bracton, f. 45 b, 46 Bracton was of the opinion that a gift of land to the Church could be voided by the heirs, but not the lord.Bracton, f. 169; Notebook pl. 1248 Throughout his work, Bracton shows a prejudice in favor of free alienation. Concerning subinfeudation, he argues that it does no wrong, though it may clearly do damage to the lords on occasion.Bracton f. 45 b-46 bP & M, p. 332, ibid. It has been difficult to determine how much of this opinion is based on Bracton's prejudice, and how much it corresponded to actual practice.P & M, p. 332, ibid. Bracton considers this problem: A enfeoffs to B to hold by a certain service and that B enfeoffs to C to hold the whole or part of the tenement by a less service. The law permits A to distrain C for the service due from B, but this violated equity.Bracton f. 21 b Then as to substitutions, even when B has done homage to A, nevertheless B may give A a new tenant by enfeoffing C to hold of A, and C will then hold of A whether A is agreeable to it or not.Bracton, f. 81 Bracton does not even expressly allow A to object that C is his personal enemy, or too poor to do the service. Pollock and Maitland consider this remarkable since Bracton does allow that the lord cannot substitute for himself in the bond of homage a new lord who is the enemy of the tenant, or too needy to fulfill the duties of warranty.P & M, Vol. 1 p. 333, ibid.Bracton, f. 82 The statute A 16th-century depiction of Edward's parliament. Parliament passed the Statute Quia Emptores in 1290. Quia Emptores was a kind of legislative afterthought meant to rectify confusion in: * land tenure * frankalmoign * subinfeudation * mesne lords * petty serjeanty * substitution * apportionment * economic delusion It indirectly affected the practices of: * distraint (also called: distress or districtio), previously legislated for in the Statute of Marlborough (1267) * escheat * wardship * marriage * socage The statute provided that subtenants could not be allowed to alienate land to other persons while retaining the nominal possession and feudal rights over it. The seller had to relinquish all rights and duties to the new buyer, and retained nothing. This was the end of subinfeudation. The middle lords or mesne lords (who could be common persons) and had granted land for service to those lower on the social scale could no longer come into existence. After Quia Emptores, every existing seignory must have been created prior to the enactment of the statute. The old feudal sequence was: the King granted land to a great lord, who then granted to lesser lords or commoners, who in turn repeated the process, becoming lesser lords (mesne lords) themselves. This was subinfeudation. The effect was to make the transfer of land a completely commercial transaction, and not one of feudalism. There were no provisions placed upon the Crown. Quia Emptores mandated that when land was alienated, the grantee was required to assume all tax and feudal obligations of the original tenant, known as substitution. Quia Emptores addressed the question of outright sales of land rights. It declared that every freeman might sell his tenement or any part of it, but in such a manner that the feoffee should hold the same lord and by the same services, of whom and by which the feoffor held. In case only a part was sold, the services were to be apportioned between the part sold and the part retained in accordance with their quantities.Pollock and Maitland vol. 1, p. 337 Nothing in the statutes addressed the King's rights, and tenants in chief of the crown continued to need royal licence to alienate their estates. On the contrary, at the time the right of alienation by substitution was being set in Statute, the King's claim to restrain any alienation by his tenants was strengthened. Quia Emptores ended the ancient practice of frankalmoign whereby lands could be donated to a Church organization to be held in perpetuity. Frankalmoign created a tenure whereby the holder (the Church) was exempt from all services, except trinoda necessitas. Quia Emptores allowed no new tenure in frankalmoign, except by the Crown.Pollock and Maitland, vol. 1, pp. 218‚Äì230 The issues arising from frankalmoign had been addressed by the Statute of Mortmain. Quia Emptores took mortmain one step further by banning outright the formation of new tenures, except by the Crown. Legacy The questions inevitably arise about Quia Emptores: was it proactive or reactive? And who benefited: King, lords or free tenants? Historians are still divided. But it is logical to conclude that Quia Emptores attempted to formalize practices of exchanging money for land, which had been going on for some centuries. There were other problems in inheritance which had festered since the time of William I. In a proclamation from 1066, William swept away the entire tradition of familial or allodial inheritance by claiming that \\"every child be his father's heir\\". The reality was different, and resulted in primogeniture inheritance. The reorganization of the country along the lines of feudalism was both shocking and difficult. Traitors forfeited their land to the Crown. This principle was designed to weaken opposition to the Crown. Frequently, it punished innocent members of the traitor's family. This was not popular. There was a saying from Kent: \\"Father to the bough, son to the plough\\" (the father hanged for treason, the son continues to work the land). The rule in Kent was that confiscated lands would be restored to the innocent family members. Seized lands throughout England were often restored to the family, despite what royal decrees may have indicated.Plucknett It is arguable that the institution of inheritance and subsequent alienation rights by tenants ended feudalism in England. Quia Emptores only formalized that end. In essence, feudalism was turned on its head. The ones with the apparent rights were the tenant class, while the great lords were still beholden to the Crown.Roebuck In the opinion of Pollack and Maitland, it is a mistake to conclude that Quia Emptores was enacted in the interest of the great lords. The one person who had all to gain and nothing to lose was the King.Pollock and Maitland, vol 1, p. 337 The Statute was considered a compromise. It allowed a continuance of the practice of selling (alienating) land, tenancy, rights and privileges for money or other value, but by substitution. One tenant could be replaced by many. In this, the great lords were forced to concede to the right of alienation to the tenants. They had been at risk of losing their services by apportionment and economic dilution. This practice had been going on for some time. Quia Emptores merely attempted to rationalize and control these practices. The great lords gained by ending the practice of subinfeudation with its consequent depreciation of escheat, wardship and marriage. History would indicate the great lords were winners as well as the Crown, since land bought from lowly tenants had a tendency to stay within their families, as has been noted above. Quia Emptores allowed freemen to sell their rights to tenancy or rights of inheritance in land. The process of escheat was affected by Quia Emptores. Expulsion of tenants from the land for failure to perform was always a difficult idea, and usually necessitated a lengthy court battle. The lord who escheated could not profit from the land, and had to hold it open for the tenant who could fulfill the obligation at a future date. Quia Emptores laid out, with some definition which had previously been lacking in the issue of tenures. In a sense, the old stereotypes were locked in place. Every feoffment made by a new tenant could not be in frankalmoign, since the donee was a layman; it would be reckoned by the laws of socage. Socage grew at the expense of frankalmoign. The tenant in chief could not alienate without the license of the King. Petty serjeanty came to be treated as \\"socage in effect\\".Pollock and Maitland vol. 1 pp. 355‚Äì366  Later history by jurisdiction England and Wales= The statute of Quia Emptores does not apply to the creation of a leasehold estate or sub-letting, as a leasehold estate is not considered a feudal estate being neither inheritable (in the Middle Ages) nor (as it remains) capable of existing forever.Megarry, Wade and Harpum (2012), The Law of Real Property (8th Edition), 3-015 (p.42) =Ireland= The statute was repealed in Ireland by the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, 2009.http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/sec0008.html#sec8 =Colonial America and the United States= * Grants of the English Colonies * De Peyster v. Michael, New York * Van Renssalaer v. Hayes, New York * Miller v. Miller, Kansas * Mandelbaum v. McDonnell, Michigan * Cuthbert v. Kuhn, Pennsylvania * New York State Constitution The English colonies in North America were founded upon royal grants or licenses. Specifically, British colonization of North America was by charter colony or proprietary colony. In this sense, they were founded upon the principles outlined by Quia Emptores. The territories were granted under conditions by which English law controlled private estates of land. The colonies were royal grants. An entire province, or any part of it, could be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of like a private estate. In 1664, the Duke of York sold New Jersey to Berkeley and Carteret. The sale was effected by deeds of lease and release. In 1708, William Penn mortgaged Pennsylvania, and under his will devising the province legal complications arose which necessitated a suit in chancery. Over time, Quia Emptores was suspended in the colonies. Arguably, certain aspects of it may still be in effect in some of the original colony states such as New York, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. However, like everything else involving Quia Emptores, opinion varies, and some element of confusion reigns. Some U.S. state court decisions have dealt with Quia Emptores. Prominent among these was the 1852 New York case of De Peyster v. Michael.6,NY 467; quoted in 28 Am. Jur 2nd Estates, ¬ß¬ß 3 and 4 There the court record is useful in describing the nature of English feudalism: In this case, the New York court offered the opinion that Quia Emptores had never been effect in the colonies. A different opinion was rendered by the New York court in the 1859 case of Van Rensselaer v. Hays (19 NY 68) where it was written that Quia Emptores had always been in effect in New York and all the colonies. There, the court noted: From 28 Am Jur 2nd Estates section 4: In the 1913 case of Miller v. Miller, the Kansas court stated: \\"Feudal tenures do not and cannot exist. All tenures in Kansas are allodial.\\"Miller v. Miller, 91 Kan 1, 136 P 953 The Supreme Court of Michigan expressed the opinion that whether Quia Emptores ever became effectual in any part of the United States by express or implied adoption or as part of the common law did not have to be ascertained. It was clear that no such statute was ever needed in Michigan or in any of the western states, because no possibility of reverter or escheat in the party conveying an estate ever existed. At all times, escheat could only accrue to the sovereign, which, in Michigan, is the state.Mandelbaum v. McDonell, 29 Michigan 78 Quia Emptores was stated not to be in effect in the state of Pennsylvania in Cuthbert v. Kuhn 3 Whart. Pa 357 The New York Constitution makes any question of Quia Emptores moot by stating: \\"all lands within this state are declared allodial, so that, subject only to liability to escheat, the entire and absolute property is vested in the owners, according to the nature of their respective estates\\".New York State Constitution Article 1; 12 =Legacy of Quia Emptores in United States law= The legacy of Quia Emptores exists in modern United States land law. Although it is a matter of debate whether Quia Emptores was the effective law within the colonies, the effect of the Statute is still present in United States land laws. Without a doubt, the U.S. Constitution, and various state constitutions and legislative acts have made Quia Emptores moribund in fact. But the language of land law still sounds medieval, and takes its concepts from the time of Edward I and before. The following list of words common in U.S. land law are from Norman England (with their modern meaning in the United States): * Alienation ‚Äì \\"a sale\\" * Appurtenant ‚Äì \\"belonging to\\" * Damnum absque injuria ‚Äì \\"injury without wrong\\" * Demise ‚Äì \\"to lease\\" or \\"let\\" premises * Enfeoff ‚Äì \\"to give land to another\\" * Estate ‚Äì \\"an interest in land\\" * Feoffee ‚Äì \\"a party to whom a fee is conveyed\\" * Feoffment ‚Äì \\"physical delivery of possession of land by feoffeor to the feofee\\" * Leasehold ‚Äì \\"an estate in land held under a lease\\" * Livery of seisin ‚Äì \\"delivery of possession\\" * Mesne ‚Äì \\"intervening\\"; related to the term \\"mesne conveyance\\" meaning an intervening conveyance * Purchase ‚Äì \\"voluntary transfer of property\\" * Seisin ‚Äì \\"possession of a freehold estate\\" * Tenant ‚Äì \\"one who holds or occupies the land under some kind of right or title\\" * Writ of Fieri Facias ‚Äì \\"writ of execution on the property of a judgment debtor\\" The terms \\"fee\\", \\"fee tail\\", \\"fee tail estate\\", \\"fee tail tenant\\", \\"fee simple\\" and the like are essentially the same as they were defined in De Donis Conditionalibus in 1285. There are four kinds of deeds in common usage: * warranty deed, which contains covenants for title. * special warranty deed in which the grantor only covenants to warrant and defend the title. * deed without covenants in which the grantor purports to convey in fee simple. * quitclaim deed in which the grantor makes no covenants for title but grants all rights, title and interest. The last two are directly related to Quia Emptores. Other changes came after the Statute of Uses, 1535 and the Statute of Frauds.

The Sydney Tar Ponds were a hazardous waste site on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. Located on the eastern shore of Sydney Harbour in the former city of Sydney (now amalgamated into the Cape Breton Regional Municipality), the Tar Ponds formed in a tidal estuary at the mouth of Muggah Creek, a freshwater stream that empties into the harbour. Throughout the 19th century, runoff from coke ovens associated with Sydney Steel Corporation's (SYSCO) now-decommissioned steel mill filled the estuary with the typical variety of coal-based contaminants and sludge. Efforts to clean up the waterway were dogged by false starts, delays, and political controversy. The coke ovens closed down but 12 years later, the toxic mess remained. After extensive public consultation and technical studies, a C$400 million cleanup plan, jointly funded by the Government of Canada and Government of Nova Scotia, was announced in January 2007. The cleanup was completed in 2013 with the opening of Open Hearth Park which is situated on the site of the former steel plant.  Geography  The North Pond and the South Pond extended over a combined area of 34 hectares (84 acres), and contained 500,000 metric tonnes of contaminated sediments. The nearby coke ovens site spanned 68 hectares (168 acres) on a sloping field overlooking the estuary. It contained an estimated 560,000 tonnes of contaminated soil. A small stream, the Coke Ovens Brook Connector, connected the coke ovens with the Tar Ponds. It served as the main pathway for contaminants migrating from the coke ovens to the Tar Ponds. To the east of the coke ovens, and uphill from them, an abandoned municipal dump served as an additional source of contaminated groundwater, or leachate. The polluted sites lay in the middle of the former city of Sydney (estimated population 25,000), now part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM) (2001 population 105,968). Almost all contaminants resulted from coke production, one of the most common industrial processes of the 19th and 20th centuries. While almost all of the contaminants derived from coal, the Tar Ponds include two pockets containing an estimated total of 3.8 metric tonnes of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). PCBs are known to cause cancer, and Sydney area residents experienced a local cancer rate 45% higher than the Nova Scotia average, and \\"by far the highest rate in Canada.\\" Government officials \\"refused to acknowledge that environmental causes may play a significant role\\" and instead suggested \\"lifestyle factors\\" including heavy smoking, poor diet and genetic causes were responsible. Research revealed that Steel workers in Sydney were inhaling what could equal smoking 30 plus packs of cigarettes a day.  History  The Sydney Coke Ovens, c.1900. In 1899, investors from Boston formed the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Limited and construction began of a major steel works on the eastern shore of Wintering Cove in Sydney Harbour. Sydney had everything needed for steelmaking, including locally mined coal, nearby iron ore from Bell Island and limestone from Aguathuna (both in Newfoundland), a good harbour for shipping, and plenty of cooling water. The mill opened in 1901, and by 1912 was turning out more than 800,000 tonnes of pig iron and 900,000 tonnes of crude steel - nearly half of Canada‚Äôs steel production - and was the largest steel producer in North America. The steel mill, and the nearby coal mines that fuelled it, operated for nearly a century under a variety of owners including Dominion Steel Company (1912), British Empire Steel Corporation (1921), and Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO) after 1930. An economically failing DOSCO was purchased by A.V. Roe Canada in 1957, which was in turn dissolved, and its assets, including DOSCO, purchased by Hawker Siddeley Canada in 1962. By the mid-1960s, Hawker Siddeley began to close money-losing subsidiaries and identified DOSCO's coal mines and steel mill as candidates for closure. By 1967, DOSCO announced plans to close the mill and began phasing out the coal mines. In response to the threatened loss of thousands of jobs in a region with poor economic prospects, the government of Nova Scotia expropriated the steel mill, renaming it Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO). The government of Canada expropriated DOSCO's coal mines at the same time, as well as the coke ovens that produced the pollution flowing into the Tar Ponds, naming this operation Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO). SYSCO purchased the coke ovens from DEVCO in 1973. Dominion Tar and Chemical Company Ltd (Domtar) operated a coal tar refining plant and a coal tar storage facility in Sydney from 1903-1962. This facility was situated directly adjacent to and north of the coke oven operations. It diverted coal tar from the coke ovens, refined it, moved it through pipes, and stored it in tanks for shipping elsewhere. Domtar ceased operations in Sydney in 1962 abandoning its storage tanks, waste disposal lagoons, pipes, buildings and equipment. Domtar conducted little or no clean up of the site. A large tank, referred to as the \\"Domtar tank\\", remained in place adjacent to the coke ovens site into the 2000s, measuring in diameter and high. It contained materials abandoned by Domtar and other materials added in the years since the facility's abandonment. By the mid-1970s, the environmental movement was gaining headway in North America, and concern about pollution from the steel mill and coke ovens was rising. Environmental activists would subsequently uncover documents showing that the government was aware of environmental problems caused by the steel plant and coke ovens as early as 1972. In 1980, scientists from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a family of chemicals produced by incomplete combustion of organic material, in lobster caught in Sydney Harbour near Muggah Creek. These same toxic chemicals were found in the homes of nearby residents. They ordered the South Arm of the harbour closed to lobster fishing, and figured the Tar Ponds as the likely source of contamination. The discovery increased pressure to close the decrepit coke ovens, which finally ceased production in 1988. Underneath the coke ovens site were approximately one hundred and sixty one kilometres of underground pipes. These pipes were used to move chemicals throughout the coke ovens and steel plant site. Despite the fact that these pipes contained a mixture of dangerous, toxic and potentially explosive substances, many were never purged of their contents when the coke ovens operations ceased. SYSCO converted to an electric arc manufacturing process in 1990, and stopped production altogether in 2000. The mill is now dismantled. In 1986, Canada and Nova Scotia signed a $34-million agreement to dredge the Tar Ponds and pump the sediments through a mile-long pipeline to a low- temperature incinerator and power plant. After many delays, the incinerator was completed, and passed required air emissions tests, in 1994. However, the pipeline system proved unable to handle the thick, lumpy Tar Ponds sludge, and the fluid-bed incinerator was hit by a series of technical problems. The sediments were also found to contain \\"at least 50,000 tonnes\\" of PCB contaminants which could only be disposed of by high-temperature incineration. The project was abandoned in 1995. In 1996, Gerry O'Malley, the Minister of Science and Technology, proposed a plan to bury the Tar Ponds under slag procured from the steel mill. By this time, the project had attracted local critics, who condemned the plan. Also in 1996, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments jointly funded a community organization, the Joint Action Group (JAG), with a mandate to \\"educate, involve and empower the community, through partnerships, to determine and implement acceptable solutions for Canada's worst hazardous waste site and to assess and address the impact on human health.\\" The three governments also embarked on detailed environmental site assessments, and a variety of preliminary cleanup projects. Although JAG held more than 950 public meetings, no clear consensus on cleanup technologies emerged. Bruno Marcocchio, founder of the Citizen Liaison Committee, complained that the JAG was only being used \\"to give credibility to back room, politically motivated manipulation.\\" Governments, meanwhile, generated more than 620 technical and scientific reports on the problem, and possible solutions. Carl Buchanan, JAG's chairman, said: \\"This is going to be the most complex environmental cleanup ever undertaken in this country, and maybe anywhere. It's never been done on this scale, and right in the middle of a city.\\"  Cleanup  On May 12, 2004, the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia announced a 10-year, $400 million CAD plan to clean up the Sydney Tar Ponds and Coke Ovens. The planProject Description--Remediation of the Sydney Tar Ponds and Coke Ovens Sites--executive summary. AMEC Earth and Environmental, 2004 called for PCB-contaminated sediments to be destroyed in an approved PCB incinerator to be set up temporarily at a decommissioned industrial facility five kilometres east of the coke ovens. Remaining materials would be treated in place and then contained within an engineered containment system. Byproducts from coke ovens that operated for 88 years on this site created run-off which contaminated the Muggah Creek estuary, creating the Sydney Tar Ponds. The coke ovens plant was demolished in the early 1990s, leaving this empty field which will be rehabilitated as part of the Tar Ponds project. At the Tar Ponds, treatment consisted of solidification/stabilization with cement, a process by which contaminated sediments are mixed with Portland cement powder or similar hardening agents. At the coke ovens, contaminated soils were treated with a form of bioremediation known as 'landfarming', in which hydrocarbon-eating bacteria and nutrients are tilled into the upper surface of the soils. The sites were then contained within a layered cap and impermeable sidewalls, and landscaped. A special operating agency of the Nova Scotia government, the Sydney Tar Ponds Agency, managed the cleanup on behalf of the two governments, in partnership with the Department of Public Works and Government Services which was the lead federal agency. Fifteen community groups in such fields as environment, health, business, labour, religion, recreation, municipal government, and higher education, contributed delegates to a Community Liaison Committee that served as a sounding board for project managers during the cleanup.  Controversy  Establishing a cleanup plan for the Tar Ponds and coke ovens site took more than 22 years. Hundreds of volunteers contributed more than 100,000 hours to the Joint Action Group's search for acceptable cleanup options. JAG and its government partners attracted vocal critics, most prominently Sierra Club Canada. Delays in getting the project started left many residents frustrated. Opinions divide on the best cleanup method. Some residents favoured digging up and destroying all of the contaminants. Others preferred not to disturb the contaminated material at all. Sierra Club Canada opposed plans to incinerate the PCB materials in favour of novel destruction technologies such as hydrogen reduction and soil washing. Project managers said the community asked that only proven technologies be used. In 2005 and 2006, the Sydney Tar Ponds Agency undertook four preliminary cleanup projects, including the re-routing of the Coke Ovens Brook Connector to a less contaminated area, and the construction of a rock barrier at the boundary between the Tar Ponds and Sydney Harbour. The preliminary projects were intended to prevent further environmental damage while the larger cleanup was assessed. In July 2006, the environmental engineering firm EarthTech, Ltd., completed a preliminary engineering design for the big cleanup. A contract for the final engineering design and construction oversight was expected to be set by September 2006.  Environmental impact assessment  In 2001, residents were demanding that the Government move them out of the community. Through the winter of 2005, controversy continued as to the type of environmental impact assessment the Government of Canada should require for the Tar Ponds cleanup. The choice boiled down to the two most rigorous forms of assessment allowed under the Canadian Environmental Assessment ActCanadian Environmental Assessment Act ( 1992, c. 37 ) a comprehensive study, conducted by remediation experts within Public Works and Government Services Canada, and a panel review, conducted by a group of experts from outside government, who would hold formal public hearings. The Government of Nova Scotia, the Cape Breton Regional Municipality, and a broad coalition of local business, labor, and health organizations favored a comprehensive study, which has half as many steps as a panel review. They argued that after 950 public meetings and 620 technical reports, the issue had been studied and debated enough, and it was time to get on with the cleanup. The Sierra Club of Canada favored a panel review as the only way to ensure necessary scrutiny of plans to incinerate PCB contaminated material, and to guarantee consideration of alternative technologies. On May 2, 2005, federal Environment Minister St√©phane Dion and Public Works Minister Scott Brison sided with the Sierra Club, ordering a panel review. In the face of predictions that the decision would delay the cleanup and add to its cost, Dion directed the panel to complete its work by June 30, 2006, and not to make recommendations that would drive cleanup costs beyond the $400 million Ottawa and Nova Scotia had already committed. The province reluctantly agreed to participate, and the joint panel review held three weeks of sparsely attended hearings in April and May 2006.  Solution  After decades of study, the federal and Nova Scotia governments concluded that the best way to deal with the Sydney Tar Ponds was to stabilize, solidify, and contain the contaminated material. In January 2007, officials from Ottawa and the province announced a $400-million plan to solidify the toxic sludge using the solidification/stabilization with cement (S/S) method. This technology was preferred over a controversial proposal to incinerate some of the 700,000 tonnes of sludge. Nordlys Environmental LP and ECC were awarded a $52-million contract in October 2009 to begin S/S operations. A public park at the former site of the tar ponds, called Open Hearth Park, in 2017 Environmentalists and local residents continued to worry officials would incinerate some of the material, though Federal and provincial officials claimed the S/S method they had chosen would stabilize the 100-hectare site without producing any adverse health or environmental effects. One way of verifying the potential for adverse health or environmental effects during remediation and clean up of the Sydney Tar Ponds and Coke Ovens site was via environmental effects monitoring prior to and during remediation activities. Dillon Consulting Limited was awarded the contract to monitor changes in chemical contaminants in groundwater, surface water and in the marine environment in Sydney Harbour during baseline (pre-construction / remediation) and during construction / remediation.Dillon Consulting Limited. (2010). Environmental Effects Monitoring and Surface Water Compliance Monitoring Program: pre-construction/baseline report (final). Volume I of II. Nova Scotia: Sydney Tar Ponds Agency. http://www.tarpondscleanup.ca/~stpa/upload/reports. The marine environment in Sydney Harbour was monitored as contaminants released via Muggah Creek have historically impacted harbour sediments and marine biota.Lee, K., Yeats, P., Smith, J., Pertie, B., & Milligan, T. G. (2002). Environmental effects and remediation of contaminants in Sydney Harbour, NS. TSRI Project Number 93. Nova Scotia Science, 2425, vii. 108 pp. Monitoring of Sydney Harbour sediments prior to and during remediation did not reveal evidence of adverse health or environmental effects due to remediation activities, and sediment quality improved due to natural recovery processes (i.e., burial of historically contaminated sediments by uncontaminated material). The cleanup was completed in 2013 with the opening of Open Hearth Park which is situated on the site of the former steel plant and has hosted events such as an Aerosmith concert in September 2014.

Plot In 1971, at a fraternity house on the University of Texas campus in Austin, Texas, Gardner Barnes (Kevin Costner) is throwing darts at a picture of himself and his ex- girlfriend Debbie (Suzy Amis). He rejoins the graduation party going on downstairs, but not before tearing the picture in half. Gardner is a member of a clique called the Groovers, whose other members include Kenneth Waggener (Sam Robards), engaged to be married, and ROTC geek Phil Hicks (Judd Nelson). Phil's parents arrive at the fraternity house just in time to see another Groover named Lester (Brian Cesak) pass out (and remain unconscious for most of the film). They also meet the strong, quiet seminary student Dorman (Chuck Bush). Kenneth interrupts the festivities by announcing his student deferment has expired and he is now to be drafted into the Vietnam War. Gardner is not surprised: his own notice came weeks before. Kenneth also reveals he has decided to call off his engagement to Debbie on account of being drafted. Gardner reacts with some joy and relief. The Groovers decide to celebrate their last days before the draft by going on a road trip, intending to visit a notorious roadhouse, then \\"dig up\\" someone - or something - named Dom near the Rio Grande. They drive all night before making a rest stop. Some, including Phil, resist continuing, but Gardner presses them on. Phil's car runs out of gas and the Groovers must decide whether to walk to the nearest town or hitch. Phil is adamant about not leaving his car behind, when someone gets the idea to lasso a train passing on the railroad track parallel to the road. Dorman successfully attaches the front bumper with some fence cable to the back of the train, but the car's front end is pulled off, leaving the car in place. The Groovers push the car to a garage in the nearest town and eat at a Sonic Drive-In. They meet up with some townie girls (one of whom is played by Elizabeth Daily) and eventually end up playing in a cemetery operated by one of the girls' undertaker father, where they come upon a fallen Vietnam War soldier's tombstone. They sleep at the former movie set of Giant. The next morning, with the car repaired with a front end from a different make and model, the Groovers continue. Phil wants to go back, prompting Kenneth to shout angrily at him. Gardner confesses they only let Phil hang with them because they felt sorry for him. Humiliated, Phil retorts that he will take on any challenge. The group sees a sign for a parachute school giving jumping lessons. Gardner cons the hippie-ish instructor Truman Sparks (Marvin J. McIntyre) into giving Phil a free lesson. Phil is terrified but goes up into Truman's aircraft. However, he is carrying Truman's dirty laundry instead of a parachute. The boys try desperately to warn him from the ground without success. Fortunately, Phil is able to open the emergency chute on his stomach with much prompting from Truman by walkie-talkie. The Groovers get a picture for their efforts; Phil gets some of his wounded pride back. After discovering the charred, abandoned remains of the roadhouse, the Groovers press onward. At last they reach a bluff overlooking the Rio Grande and dig up Dom ‚Äì which turns out to be a magnum of Dom P√©rignon champagne. Each takes a drink before Gardner toasts to \\"freedom and youth.\\" Kenneth is disheartened, having second thoughts about calling off the engagement. Pondering on the nature of love, Gardner decides to make things right. He calls Debbie, gets her to re-accept the engagement, and arranges for Truman Sparks to fly her from Dallas to the border town and back. Through some trickery, reminiscent of stone soup, he sets up a beautiful wedding for Kenneth and Debbie. Debbie and Gardner share one last dance before the wedding. After the ceremony, Phil gives Kenneth and Debbie his car as a wedding present. Lester goes to hitch a ride \\"anywhere\\" and Phil and Dorman shake hands before leaving. Perched atop a cliff overlooking the town and watching the wedding reception, Gardner lifts a beer in salute to his friends.

In the United States, the book created popular interest in hashish, leading to hashish candy and private hashish clubs. The book was later popular in the counter-culture movement of the 1960s. The Hasheesh Eater is often compared to Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (1821), Thomas De Quincey's account of his own addiction to laudanum (opium and alcohol). Publication history First published in 1857, The Hasheesh Eater went through four editions in the late 1850s and early 1860s, each put out by Harper & Brothers. In 1903, another publishing house put a reprint of the original edition -- and the last complete edition until 1970. , two editions are in print, including an annotated version first published in 2003. Literary significance Ludlow said, \\"The entire truth of Nature cannot be copied,\\" so \\"the artist must select between the major and minor facts of the outer world; that, before he executes, he must pronounce whether he will embody the essential effect, that which steals on the soul and possesses it without painful analysis, or the separate details which belong to the geometrician and destroy the effect.\\"Ludlow, Fitz Hugh \\"Harriet Hosmer‚Äôs Zenobia\\", The Atlantic Monthly February 1865, p. 249, col. 1 Many of his passages, which may have seemed like fantastic myth-making to his contemporaries, ring true today with more modern knowledge of the psychedelic state.Kalant, O.J. ‚ÄúLudlow on Cannabis‚Äù The International Journal of the Addictions 6(2) June 1971, pp. 309-322 Ludlow writes of one hallucination: \\"And now, with time, space expanded also‚Ä¶ The whole atmosphere seemed ductile, and spun endlessly out into great spaces surrounding me on every side.\\"Ludlow, Fitz Hugh \\"The Night Entrance\\", The Hasheesh Eater 1857 Ludlow describes the marijuana user as one who is reaching for \\"the soul‚Äôs capacity for a broader being, deeper insight, grander views of Beauty, Truth and Good than she now gains through the chinks of her cell.\\"Ludlow, Fitz Hugh \\"The Visionary\\", The Hasheesh Eater 1857 Conversely, he says of hashish users: \\"Ho there! pass by; I have tried this way; it leads at last into poisonous wildernesses.\\" Cultural effect The popularity of The Hasheesh Eater led to interest in the drug it described. Not long after its publication, the Gunjah Wallah Co. in New York began advertising \\"Hasheesh Candy\\": > The Arabian \\"Gunjh\\" of Enchantment confectionized. ‚Äî A most pleasurable and > harmless stimulant. ‚Äî Cures Nervousness, Weakness, Melancholy, &c.; Inspires > all classes with new life and energy.

John Hay‚Äôs A Poet in Exile: The Early Letters of John Hay (ed. Caroline Ticknor, 1910, p.22-23) contains the complete letter to the poet Nora Perry dated 2 January 1859, in which he says ‚ÄúThe city of Wayland‚Ä¶ is shrined in my memory as a far-off mystical Eden where the women were lovely and spirituelle, and the men were jolly and brave; where I used to haunt the rooms of the Athen√¶um, made holy by the presence of the royal dead; where I used to pay furtive visits to Forbes‚Äô forbidden mysteries (peace to its ashes!), where I used to eat Hasheesh and dream dreams.‚Äù And a classmate recalls that after reading Ludlow‚Äôs book, Hay ‚Äúmust needs experiment with hasheesh a little, and see if it was such a marvelous stimulant to the imagination as Fitzhugh Ludlow affirmed. ‚ÄòThe night when Johnny Hay took hasheesh‚Äô marked an epoch for the dwellers in Hope College.‚ÄùThayer, William Roscoe The Life and Letters of John Hay v. 1, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1916, p. 47; see also Thayer, William RoscoeAmerican Statesman: John Hay Vol. 1 (1908) p. 47. The quote comes from Rev. J. H. Gilmore: ‚ÄúOn one occasion, at least, his enthusiasm for literature was carried to excess. ‚ÄòThe Hasheesh Eater‚Äô had recently appeared (1857) and Johnny must needs experiment with hasheesh a little, and see if it was such a marvelous stimulant to the imagination as Fitzhugh Ludlow affirmed. ‚ÄòThe night when Johnny Hay took hasheesh‚Äô marked an epoch for the dwellers in Hope College. It‚Äôs fifty-six years ago; but I remember it well.‚Äù Within twenty-five years of the publication of The Hasheesh Eater, many cities in the United States had private hashish parlors. And there was already controversy about the legality and morality of cannabis intoxication. In 1876, when tourists could buy hashish at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, the Illustrated Police News would write about ‚ÄúThe Secret Dissipation of New York Belles‚Ä¶ a Hasheesh Hell on Fifth Avenue.‚ÄùIllustrated Police News 2 December 1876 Rediscovery Ludlow‚Äôs writings crop up in a couple of places in pre-marijuana-prohibition 20th century America. The occultist Aleister Crowley found The Hasheesh Eater to be ‚Äútainted by admiration of de Quincey and the sentimentalists‚Äù but admired Ludlow‚Äôs ‚Äúwonderful introspection‚Äù and printed significant excerpts from the book in his journal The Equinox. Using the pseudonym Oliver Haddo, Crowley also wrote at length about his own cannabis experiences, comparing and contrasting them to those of Ludlow. He ‚Äúwas struck by the circumstance that [Ludlow], obviously ignorant of Vedantist and Yogic doctrines, yet approximately expressed them, though in a degraded and distorted form.‚ÄùHaddo, Oliver (pseud. for Crowley, Aleister) ‚ÄúThe Psychology of Hashish‚Äù The Equinox 2, Sept. 1910 After the prohibition of marijuana, the writings of Ludlow were interpreted by two camps. On the one hand, there were the prohibitionists, who pointed out Ludlow‚Äôs addiction to ‚Äúhasheesh‚Äù and his horrifying hallucinations; on the other, those who believed that cannabis deserved a second chance and saw Ludlow as a literate chronicler of the mystical heights that could be reached using the drug. In 1938, shortly after the federal government cracked down on marijuana, the prohibitionist warning was carried in the book Marihuana: America‚Äôs New Drug Problem. The book included several pages of excerpts from The Hasheesh Eater and noted that > It was Ludlow‚Ä¶ who contributed the most remarkable description of the > hashish effects. He not only described the acute hashish episode with great > intensity and fidelity but recorded the development of an addiction and the > subsequent struggle which resulted in his breaking the habit. As an > autobiography of a drug addict it is, in several respects, superior to De > Quincey's ‚ÄúConfessions‚ÄùWalton, Robert P. Marihuana: America‚Äôs New Drug > Problem Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott, 1976 (originally published in 1938) In 1953, Union College selected the alumnus Fitz Hugh Ludlow as a ‚ÄúUnion Worthy‚Äù and invited three academics to compose speeches for the occasion. Morris Bishop (who would later include his impressions in his book Eccentrics), criticized Ludlow‚Äôs later attempts at fiction, writing that his short stories ‚Äúare today stale and meaningless‚Ä¶ echoes of all the other magazine stories of his time, originating in literature, not in life, and conducted with no regard for truth and with little for verisimilitude.‚Äù In The Hasheesh Eater on the other hand: > is a sincerity, a reality, which he could not recapture when he tried to > construct stories solely from his imagination‚Ä¶ He finds lyric phrasing to > convey the unearthly beauty of his visions, and the unearthly horror of the > evil fantasia which succeeded his bliss.

DeRopp suspected that ‚Äúin many places scientific impartiality has been sacrificed in the interests of literary effect.‚ÄùDeRopp, Robert S. Drugs and the Mind New York: Dell 1976 (originally published in 1957) At this point we are at the dawn of the resurgence of marijuana in the United States and the emergence of psychedelics in the English-speaking world. Researchers, like pioneering mescaline researcher Heinrich Kl√ºver, looked to Ludlow‚Äôs seminal writings on the psychedelic experience for insight on the new drugs that were being discovered and synthesized. In 1960, The Hasty Papers: A One-Shot Review, a beat literature journal, devoted most of its pages to reprinting the first edition of The Hasheesh Eater in its entirety, and David Ebin‚Äôs book The Drug Experience included three chapters from The Hasheesh Eater. In 1966, excerpts were published in The Marijuana Papers edited by David Solomon. In 1970, a reprint of the 1857 edition was put out by Gregg Press, and the Berkeley Barb reprinted several chapters. By this time Ludlow had been rediscovered, both by mainstream researchers into drugs and addiction, and by the growing drug-savvy counterculture. Oriana J. Kalant, in 1971 in The International Journal of the Addictions found The Hasheesh Eater to be a remarkable description of the effects of cannabis: > ‚Ä¶it is evident that Ludlow recognized, with remarkable insight, most of the > characteristic subjective effects of cannabis. He also noted, and > interpreted essentially correctly, such pharmacological points as the > relation of dose to effect, inter- and intra-individual variations in > response, and the influence of set and setting. Most importantly, perhaps, > he recorded the development of his dependence on cannabis more > comprehensively and astutely than anyone to date. The initial motives ‚Äî > including features of his own personality and temperament ‚Äî the constant > rationalization, compulsive use despite obvious untoward effects, the > progression to a state of almost continuous intoxication, the inability to > reduce his dose gradually, and the intense craving and depression after > abrupt withdrawal, all are clearly described. Ludlow recognized also the > lack of physical symptoms during withdrawal, and the difference from opium > withdrawal in this respect. With the benefit of hindsight, we can also > identify in Ludlow‚Äôs account a number of other features consistent with > present knowledge, but which even scientists of his day could not possibly > have known. For example, the initial change in tolerance, the continuum > between euphoria and hallucinations, the differentiation between the > hallucinatory process and the affective reactions to it, the relation > between spontaneous and drug-induced perceptual changes, the similarity > between the effects of cannabis and those of other hallucinogens, the > attempts at drug substitution therapy (opium, tobacco), and the role of > psychotherapy and abreactive writing, are all in keeping with contemporary > thought. These points permit the modern reader to feel even greater > confidence in the extraordinary accuracy and perceptiveness of Ludlow‚Äôs > record.Kalant, O.J. ‚ÄúLudlow on Cannabis‚Äù The International Journal of the > Addictions 6(2) June 1971, pp. 309-322 The mid 1970s saw two new editions of The Hasheesh Eater in print, one by San Francisco‚Äôs City Lights Books, and a well-annotated and illustrated version edited by Michael Horowitz and released by Level Press. By the late 1970s, you could even find the face of Fitz Hugh Ludlow on a T-shirt, thanks to his alma mater Union College, which had thrown a ‚ÄúFitzhugh Ludlow Day‚Äù celebration in 1979. In the 2000s, Ludlow has been introduced to a new generation of psychedelics users through Terence McKenna, who read chapters from The Hasheesh Eater for a set of tapes (‚ÄúVictorian Tales of Cannabis‚Äù) put out by Sound Photosynthesis, and who regularly praised Ludlow in his books, saying Ludlow ‚Äúbegan a tradition of pharmo-picaresque literature that would find later practitioners in William Burroughs and Hunter S. Thompson.‚Ä¶ Part genius, part madman, Ludlow lies halfway between Captain Ahab and P.T. Barnum, a kind of Mark Twain on hashish. There is a wonderful charm to his free-spirited, pseudoscientific openness as he makes his way into the shifting dunescapes of the world of hashish.‚ÄùMcKenna, Terence Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge New York: Bantam, 1992, pp. 163-164: ‚ÄúAfter Bayard Taylor the next great commentator on the phenomenon of hashish was the irrepressible Fitz Hugh Ludlow. This little-known bon vivant of nineteenth- century literature began a tradition of pharmo-picaresque literature that would find later practitioners in William Burroughs and Hunter S. Thompson‚Ä¶ There is in Ludlow‚Äôs cannabis reportage a wonderful distillation of all that was zany in the Yankee transcendentalist approach. Ludlow creates a literary persona not unlike the poet John Shade in Nabokov‚Äôs Pale Fire, a character who allows us to see deeper into his predicament than he can see himself. Part genius, part madman, Ludlow lies halfway between Captain Ahab and P.T. Barnum, a kind of Mark Twain on hashish. There is a wonderful charm to his free- spirited, pseudoscientific openness as he makes his way into the shifting dunescapes of the world of hashish.‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater remains Ludlow's most remembered work.

This film, which takes its name from the Segway's average speed, documents Caldwell's 100-day, coast to coast journey across the United States riding the \\"Human Transporter\\". The trip started in Seattle, Washington on August 8, 2004 and ended in Boston, Massachusetts on November 18, 2004. 10 MPH has had a favorable reaction at screenings and film festivals and has won several awards. Plot 10 MPH follows the progress of Caldwell as he rides a Segway scooter across the United States from Seattle to Boston, stopping at many places along the way to interact with people. The film focuses on showing the dynamic nature of the US countryside as well as documenting the stories of people Caldwell and Weeks encounter along the way. 10 MPH shows Caldwell, Weeks, and other members of the crew but also provides footage of the people they meet, both helpful and rude. For example, Caldwell and the crew are stopped by an Illinois police officer who admonishes them for traveling at on a road with a speed limit. The filmmakers also document their struggles, from the technical challenges of maintaining the Segway's batteries to the production challenge of losing a producer part way through the filming process. Development Dissatisfied with their average corporate jobs, filmmakers Weeks and Caldwell formed a production company, Spinning Blue, in Denver, Colorado prior to beginning production of 10 MPH. They have discussed their lack of training and experience in the film industry, lack of investment capital to make the film, and lack of film industry contacts as challenges at the beginning of the process. Rather than pursuing traditional channels of film making, Weeks and Caldwell used the Web to raise funds and promote 10 MPH. They conceived the idea of making a film before knowing what it would be about. Shortly thereafter, a friend gave them the idea of making a film involving a Segway. In 2004, Weeks and Caldwell purchased a Segway and decided to film a documentary about traveling across the United States at . Caldwell actually rode the scooter while Weeks directed and managed the film footage. Weeks and other members of the production crew followed Caldwell in a car with the film equipment. They used a Sony PD-150 to capture 180 hours of footage. Post-production occurred back in Denver after the Segway journey with involvement from other members of the Denver film community. Distribution 10 MPH is available in several ways including on DVD, which premiered on May 29, 2007 in the United States and is available through Netflix and other outlets, and by direct download from the film Web site and from iTunes. Additionally, Weeks and Caldwell spent months in 2007 traveling back over their path to show the finished documentary in theaters along the way. Critical response The documentary received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 80 percent based on reviews from five critics, with a rating average of 7.4 out of 10. In Wired Magazine, Dylan Tweney wrote that 10 MPH ‚Äú...is about more than just a couple of geeks with their high-tech toy: It's lighthearted and entertaining, with an overarching message about accomplishing your dreams and doing your ‚Äòthing.‚Äô‚Äù Jeff Inglis of the Boston Phoenix compared it with other accounts of American road trips, writing; ‚ÄúWhat Caldwell and Weeks have made is a road movie, in the tradition, perhaps, of Charles Kuralt‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn the Road‚Äù reports for CBS News, or maybe more like William Least Heat-Moon's backroads peregrinations in Blue Highways.‚Äù The documentary also received praise in the West Seattle Herald, where Bruce Bulloch called Caldwell and Weeks ‚Äúsavvy storytellers‚Äù and applauded 10 MPH for being a ‚Äúwitty counterpoint to the hyped-up rhythms of American life.‚Äù Bulloch further commented of 10 MPH, that despite its slow tempo ‚Äú[it] has a seductive vitality about it ‚Äì the last fit of reckless abandon of a disappearing youth.‚Äù Noting that while the popularity of documentaries has risen in recent years; ‚ÄúThey're generally politically charged forays into the troubling issues of our times. ‚Äò10 MPH‚Äô heads off in another direction, taking us, regardless of age, on a sentimental journey to the cusp of adulthood when a sense of adventure was still an important virtue.‚Äù Of a more critical opinion, where The Christian Science Monitor, which commented, ‚ÄúThe duo's hook for a movie is to document their gimmicky journey from Seattle to Boston on a Segway scooter. We never truly get inside the heads of these unlikely pioneers but scenic photography and lively side characters make for a diverting trip.‚Äù On a similar note, Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post, reflected that ‚ÄúThe narration can be a tad earnest. The aesthetic is decidedly DIY. Still, \\"10 mph,\\" with its wit, beckoning shots of splendid landscapes, and impromptu interviews, might have you humming Woody Guthrie, This land is your land, this land is my land.‚Äù In a favorable review in the Boise Weekly, Travis Estvold wrote ‚ÄúThough piloting a Segway seems a bit gimmicky, it does what the filmmakers probably intended: It attracts plenty of attention. But it also does something that may not have been intentional: The voyage of the battery-powered machine takes a backseat to the personalities of the filmmakers and the characters they meet along the way.‚Äù In the review Estvold complemented the documentary makers for somehow capturing ‚Äúevery cross section of Americana as they ever-so-slowly wound their way from the home of the Space Needle to the city of Fenway Park.‚Äù In an article on upcoming releases in 2007, the Boston Globe mentioned 10 MPH, calling it an ‚Äú..amusingly offbeat documentary.‚Äù In the Idaho Statesman, Chad Dryden remarked; ‚Äú10 MPH succeeds on many levels. For one, it‚Äôs a terrific American travelogue, taking the viewer through small-town charm, purple mountain majesty and the big city‚Äôs vibrating pulse. More importantly, it‚Äôs an inspiring story about cutting through the stagnancy of 21st-century life to follow your dreams.‚Äù Calling the documentary ‚ÄúCharming and maddening‚Äù, Jordan Harper raised concerns with the main concepts of 10 MPH, writing in the Dallas Observer, ‚Äú...for good and ill: The American dream has been determined, and that dream is to become famous not for talent or beauty, but simply for doing something peculiar; if you can't be the American Idol, be one of those jackasses from the auditions. The guys seem nice enough, and there are plenty of sweet slices of Americana, so you might find yourself torn. It's hard not to be drawn in by the film's good-natured vibe, but there's no getting around the urge to smack these guys and tell them to make their next movie about anything except themselves.‚Äù Artwork and soundtrack 10 MPH features artwork by the director's sister, Gannon Weeks, who also appeared in the film and performed public relations, logistics, and other duties.

The move 1.f3 does not a piece, opens no for pieces, and actually hinders the development of White's by denying it its most natural square, f3. It also weakens White's pawn structure, opens the e1‚Äìh4 diagonal against White's uncastled king, and opens the g1‚Äìa7 diagonal against White's potential kingside castling position. Since 1.f3 is a poor move, it is not played often. Nonetheless, it is probably not the rarest opening move. After 1.f3 e5 some players even continue with the nonsensical 2.Kf2, which is sometimes called the Fried Fox Attack, Wandering King Opening, The Hammerschlag, Tumbleweed, the Pork Chop Opening, or the Half Bird as it is often called in the United Kingdom, due to its opening move f3 being half that of the f4 employed in Bird's Opening. One example of this is the game Simon Williams versus Martin Simons in the last round of the British Championship 1999, where Williams had nothing to play for.Opening Lanes Garry Lane, Chesscafe.com In 2020 Magnus Carlsen played 2.Kf2 against Wesley So in a blitz game, for the psychological effect. So commented, \\"It's hard to forget the game when someone plays f3 and Kf2 and just crushes you. That's so humiliating.\\" Also played is 2.e4, called the King's Head Opening. Despite its obvious deficiencies, 1.f3 does not lose the game for White. Black can secure a comfortable advantage by the normal means - advancing central pawns and rapidly developing pieces to assert control over the . If Black replies 1...e5, the game might proceed into a passive line known as the Blue Moon Defence. It usually occurs after the moves 1.f3 e5 2.Nh3 d5 3.Nf2 (avoiding 3...Bxh3 4.gxh3 weakening the kingside) 3...Nf6 4.e3 Nc6 5.Be2 Bc5 6.0-0 0-0. White has no stake in the centre, but hopes to make a to break into. If White plays poorly and leaves too many against his king after 2.Kf2, he might be quickly checkmated. One example: 1.f3 d5 2.Kf2 e5 (Black places two pawns in the centre to prepare for quick development) 3.e4 Bc5+ 4.Kg3 Qg5#.  Fool's mate  Barnes Opening can lead to Fool's mate, 1.f3 e5 2.g4 Qh4#. Of all of White's legal moves on his second move, only one allows mate in one, while another, 2.h3, allows mate in two.

It is the third film of a trilogy by Spheeris depicting life in Los Angeles at various points in time. The first film, The Decline of Western Civilization (1981), dealt with the punk rock scene during 1980‚Äì1981. The second film, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years (1988), covers the Los Angeles heavy metal movement of 1986‚Äì1988. Spheeris later credited the 1998 film with having a profound effect on her. She began a relationship with a man she met while filming the movie, signed up to be a foster parent, and eventually fostered five children. Synopsis The film involves gutter punks who take the anti-establishment message with extreme seriousness and tune out society completely. Spheeris talks to homeless teenagers living on the street or squatting in abandoned buildings in Los Angeles, an unstable mother, Los Angeles Police Department officer Gary Fredo, and a paralyzed youth living on disability benefits. Musicians interviewed include Keith Morris (Black Flag, Circle Jerks) and Flea (Fear, Red Hot Chili Peppers). Performances by four bands were filmed: Final Conflict, Litmus Green, Naked Aggression, and The Resistance. Reception and distribution The film premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival where it won the Freedom of Expression Award. It was screened at the Cannes Film Festival and the Chicago Underground Film Festival, where it received a jury award. However, it never went into general release and was not available on VHS or DVD until the release in 2015 of a box set containing all three films on DVD and blu-ray. This was partly due to Spheeris refusing to relinquish the rights to the first two parts of the trilogy in order to enable the third to be released. According to an article by Laura Snapes, \\"there was little demand to see such a depressing movie, and the few distribution offers that Spheeris got required her to hand over the rights to the first two movies, which she refused to do\\" Decline III was also released separately via streaming video.

Biography He began the study of law when he was 14 in the office of Samuel B. Ludlow of Albany. His parents soon afterward moved to Oneida County, where he entered the office of Henry R. Storrs. In 1827 he completed his studies and was admitted to the bar. While not yet 30 he was appointed district attorney of Oneida County and soon rose to the front rank of the profession there. Later he relocated to New York City. Though never a politician he took a deep interest in public affairs and was a man of extensive learning. His conversational powers were of the highest order. He cultivated an interest in beauty, art, and literature, and he possessed one of the finest law libraries in the U.S., which, upon his death, he gave to Hamilton College. Noyes became one of the most powerful advocates at the New York bar. In 1857 he was appointed by the legislature a commissioner with Alexander W. Bradford and David Dudley Field to codify the laws of the state, and he was engaged in this work up to the time of his death. In the autumn of that year he was nominated as a Republican for attorney general of the state but was defeated by Lyman Tremain. In 1861 the legislature appointed him a commissioner to the conference, where he steadily labored to preserve the integrity of the republic, and at the same time maintain the honor of the loyal states. When, in the winter of the same year, the legislature had to elect a United States senator, he was one of the chief candidates for the nomination. Mr. Noyes was retained in some of the most celebrated cases of his day. His masterly analysis of moral insanity on the trial of Huntington, his argument in the court of appeals in the New Haven railroad case, his elaborate speech in the suit of the Delaware and Hudson Canal company vs. The Pennsylvania Coal Co. and his numerous arguments in some of the most important will cases were marked by learning, eloquence and close logic. He was a firm advocate of temperance and devoted much time to addresses on this subject. His talents were always enlisted on the side of the people among whom he lived, and more than once fraudulent judgments against the city were vacated through his clear demonstration of their fallacy. As an equity lawyer he was without parallel, and in cross-examination he had no equal. Few witnesses that went on the stand before him with the determination to commit perjury ever left it without being exposed. In 1856 he delivered an address before the graduating class of the law department of Hamilton College, and, although he had never received a college education, that institution conferred on him the degree of LL.D. True to his motto that it was \\"better that a man's brain should wear out than rust out,\\" he continued to the last in the practice of his profession. His death was the result of apoplexy.

He was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1995 who represented the west Toronto riding of Etobicoke. From 1990 to 1995 he was a cabinet minister in the government of Bob Rae. Background Philip was educated at St. Joseph's Teachers' College, the University of Ottawa, and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, earning a Master's Degree in Education. He worked as an adult educator and management consultant before entering politics, and was a coordinator of leadership training with the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. Philip was married to Audrey with whom he has two children (twins) Andrew Fergus and Sarah Meghan Philip. Previously, he was married to Suzanne. Politics He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1975, defeating incumbent Liberal Leonard Braithwaite by 1,256 votes in the Toronto riding of Etobicoke. He was re-elected by a greater margin in the election of 1977, and fended off a stronger challenge from Progressive Conservative Aileen Anderson in the 1981 election. In the elections of 1985, 1987 and 1990, he was elected without difficulty. Philip supported Bob Rae for the provincial NDP leadership in 1982. During his time in opposition he held various critic portfolios including transportation, housing, rent review and government services. He was also chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. During this session he presented a discussion paper entitled \\"Guidelines for Public Accounts Committees in Canada\\" which discussed the evolving role of this type of legislative committee. =Government= In the 1990 provincial election the NDP won and formed a majority government under the leadership of Bob Rae. Philip had been his party's Transport Critic for the previous three years, and was appointed as Ontario's Minister of Transport on October 1, 1990. He became Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology on July 31, 1991, and Minister of Municipal Affairs on February 3, 1993. He was also the interim Minister of Tourism and Recreation from November 13, 1992 to February 3, 1993. Philip was on the right wing of the NDP. He recommended greater privileges for multinational pharmaceutical companies while in government, and rejected a \\"global warming\\" strategy while in the Transportation portfolio. Notwithstanding this, he was generally supportive of progressive legislation and was regularly endorsed by left-leaning groups in Toronto. The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election, and Philip lost the riding of Etobicoke-Rexdale to Progressive Conservative John Hastings by fewer than 900 votes. This was considered a major upset, and Philip was regarded as a favoured candidate for re-election when he ran in the redistributed seat of Etobicoke North in the 1999 provincial election. The character of the riding had changed since the 1980s, however, and many in the riding's large community of recent immigrants had no history of supporting the NDP. Philip finished third, and Hastings was re-elected by what most considered to be a vote-split among the Liberals and NDP. =Cabinet positions=ReferencesNotesCitations=External links * Category:1940 births Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Ontario New Democratic Party MPPs Category:Politicians from Montreal ","title":"Ed Philip"},{"id":"1637654","text":"Mohammed Abdullah Sheikh (5 December 1905 ‚Äì 8 September 1982) was a Kashmiri politician who played a central role in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir, the northernmost Indian state. Referred as \\"Sher-e-Kashmir\\" (Lion of Kashmir), Abdullah was the founding leader of the All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference (later renamed Jammu and Kashmir National Conference) and the 1st elected Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir after its accession to India. He agitated against the rule of the Maharaja Hari Singh and urged self-rule for Kashmir.Guha, Ramachandra. \\"Opening a window in Kashmir.\\" Economic and Political Weekly (2004): 3905-3913. He served as the 1st elected Prime Minister of the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir and was later jailed and exiled. He was dismissed from the position of Prime Ministership on 8 August 1953 and Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad was appointed as the new Prime Minister. The expressions ‚ÄòSadar-i-Riyasat‚Äô and ‚ÄòPrime Minister‚Äô were replaced with the terms ‚ÄòGovernor‚Äô and ‚ÄòChief Minister‚Äô in 1965. Sheikh Abdullah again became the Chief Minister of the state following the 1974 Indira-Sheikh accord and remained in the top slot till his death on 8 September 1982.Rakesh Ankit, \\"Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah of Kashmir, 1965‚Äì1975: From Externment to Enthronement.\\" Studies in Indian Politics 6.1 (2018): 88-102 online. Early life Abdullah Sheikh was born in Soura, a village on the outskirts of Srinagar, eleven days after the death of his father Sheikh Mohammed Ibrahim. His father had been a middle class manufacturer and trader of Kashmiri shawls. According to Abdullah Sheikh, his step brother mistreated his mother and his early childhood was marked by utter poverty. His mother was keen that her children should receive proper education and, so, as a child, he was first admitted to a traditional school or Maktab where he learnt the recitation of the Quran and some basic Persian texts like Gulistan of Sa'di, Bostan, Padshanama, etc. Then in 1911 he was admitted to a primary school where he studied for about two years. However, their family barber Mohammed Ramzan prevailed upon his uncle to send him back to school. He had to walk the distance of ten miles to school and back on foot but in his own words the joy of being allowed to obtain a school education made it seem a light work. He passed his Matriculation examination from Punjab University in 1922. Higher studies After matriculation he obtained admission in Shri Pratap College, the leading college of Kashmir. He also went to the Prince of Wales College in Jammu. Then he took admission in Islamia College, Lahore and graduated from there. In 1930, he obtained an M.Sc. in Chemistry from Aligarh Muslim University. During his college days he was an eye witness of the protests of the workers of the Government Silk Factory during the Silk Factory Workers Agitation and the sight of workers agitating for their rights made a deep impression on him and was an important factor in motivating him to struggle for the rights of the people of the Jammu and Kashmir State. Political activism Kashmiri polymath and lawyer Molvi Abdullah. His lectures motivated Abdullah Sheikh and other educated Muslim youth to struggle for justice and fundamental rights As a student at Aligarh Muslim University, he came in contact with and was influenced by persons with liberal and progressive ideas. He became convinced that the feudal system was responsible for the miseries of the Kashmiris and like all progressive nations of the world Kashmir too should have a democratically elected government. =Muslim Conference= Abdullah Sheikh and his colleagues were greatly influenced by the lectures of a Kashmiri polymath and lawyer Molvi Abdullah. Molvi Abdullah's son Molvi Abdul Rahim, Abdullah Sheikh and Ghulam Nabi Gilkar were the first three educated Kashmiri youth to be arrested during the public agitation of 1931. left Kashmir's first political party the Kashmir Muslim Conference with Abdullah Sheikh as President, Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas as general secretary, and Molvi Abdul Rahim as Secretary was formed on 16 October 1932. In his presidential address Abdullah Sheikh categorically stated that the Muslim Conference had come into existence to struggle for the rights of all oppressed sections of the society and not Muslims alone. It was not a communal party and would struggle for the rights of the oppressed, whether Hindu, Muslim or Sikh, with the same fervor. He reasserted that the struggle of Kashmiris was not a communal struggle. In March 1933 the Muslim Conference constituted a committee which included Molvi Abdullah and nine other members for the purpose of establishing contacts with non-Muslim parties and exploring the possibility of forming a joint organisation. Those nine members were Khwaja Saad-ud-din Shawl, Khwaja Hassan Shah Naqshbandi, Mirwaiz Kashmir, Molvi Ahmad-Ullah, Mirwaiz Hamadani, Agha Syed Hussain Shah Jalali, Mufti Sharif-ud-din, Molvi Atiq-Ullah and Haji Jafar Khan. According to Abdullah Sheikh this effort was not successful because of the unfavourable reception of the idea by the non- Muslim parties. Abdullah Sheikh campaigned to change the name of the Muslim Conference to National Conference, under the influence of among others Jawaharlal Nehru. After a prolonged and vigorous campaign a special session of the Muslim Conference held in June 1939 voted to change the name of the party to National Conference. Of the 176 members attending the session, 172 members voted in favour of the resolution. According to Abdullah Sheikh the support of Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas of Jammu was very important in motivating the members to vote for this change. =Electoral politics= As a result of the 1931 agitation, the Maharajah appointed a Grievances Commission with an Englishman B.J. Glancy as President who submitted its report in March 1932.Justice A.S. Anand (2006), p28 Subsequently, a Constitutional Reforms Conference also presided over by B.J. Glancy recommended the setting up of an elected Legislative Assembly (Praja Sabha). Consequently, a Praja Sabha with 33 elected and 42 nominated members elected on the basis of separate electorates for Hindus and Muslims was established in 1934.Regulation No1. of Samvat1991 (22 April 1934) Women and illiterate men without sufficient property, or title, or annual income of less than Rupees four hundred did not have the right to vote. Roughly less than 10% (according to Justice Anand only 3%) of the population were enfranchised.Justice A.S. Anand (2006), p30 Even after the formation of Praja Sabha in 1934 as recommended by the Commission real power continued to remain in the hands of the Maharajah.Justice A.S. Anand (2006), p36 Seventeen years later in 1951, the government of Kashmir with Sheikh Abdullah as Prime Minister held elections to a Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Sheikh Abdullah's Government had been accused of rigging in these elections to the Constituent Assembly.APHC: White Paper on Elections In Kashmir Badshah Khan (centre) at Shalimar Garden in 1945right Sheikh Abdullah was introduced to Jawaharlal Nehru in 1937 and as he too was a leader of the Indian National Congress was demanding similar rights for people of British India and had formed The All India States Peoples Conference for supporting the people of Princely States in their struggle for a representative government the two became friends and political allies. =National Conference= He introduced a resolution in the working committee of the Muslim Conference for changing its name to National Conference on 24 June 1938 to allow people from all communities to join the struggle against the autocratic rule of the Maharaja. Meanwhile, he along with his liberal progressive friends, many of whom were not Muslim like Kashyap Bandhu, Jia Lal Kilam, Pandit Sudama Sidha, Prem Nath Bazaz and Sardar Budh Singh drafted the National DemandsRasheed Taseer (1973) vol2, p29 the forerunner of the famous Naya Kashmir (New Kashmir) Manifesto (which was a charter of demands for granting a democratic constitution committed to the welfare of the common people of Kashmir)Rasheed Taseer (1973) vol2, p314-383 He presented these demands to the Maharajah in a speech on 28 August 1938.Rasheed Taseer (1973) vol2, p25 The Maharajah was not willing to accept these demands and so he along with many of his companions was arrested for defying prohibitory orders and sentenced to six months imprisonment and a fine. His arrest provoked a public agitation in which volunteers called Dictators (so called because they had the authority to defy laws that was forbidden for normal law-abiding party members) courted arrest. This agitation was called off on the appeal of Mohandas K. Gandhi. He was released after serving his sentence on 24 February 1939 and accorded a grand reception by the people of Srinagar on his return. Speeches were made at the reception stressing the importance of unity among Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs.Rasheed Taseer (1973) vol2, p25-40 Subsequently the resolution for changing the name of Muslim Conference to National Conference was ratified with an overwhelming majority by the General Council of the Muslim Conference on 11 June 1939 and from that date Muslim Conference became National Conference. =Quit Kashmir agitation= In May 1946 Sheikh Abdullah launched the Quit Kashmir agitation against the Maharajah Hari Singh and was arrested and sentenced to three years imprisonment but was released only sixteen months later on 29 September 1947. According to prominent columnist and writer A. G. Noorani, Quit Kashmir was ill-timed and illogical.

Also in his letter to the Maharaja Lord Mountbatten wrote \\"My Government and I note with satisfaction that your Highness has decided to invite Sheikh Abdullah to form an Interim Government to work with your Prime Minister.\\" The support of Mahatma Gandhi and Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a key factor in getting Sheikh Abdullah appointed as Head of the emergency administration by the Maharaja. As a consequence, Sheikh Abdullah was appointed head of an emergency administration by an order issued by the Maharaja which was undated except for the mention October 1947 in place of the date. He took charge as Head of the Emergency Administration on 30 October 1947. He raised a force of local Kashmiri volunteers to patrol Srinagar and take control of administration after the flight of the Maharaja along with his family and Prime Minister Meher Chand Mahajan to Jammu even before the Indian troops had landed. This group of volunteers would serve as the nucleus for the subsequent formation of Jammu and Kashmir Militia. This, Sheikh Abdullah hoped, would take over the defence of Kashmir after the Indian army was withdrawn. This was articulated in his letter to Sardar Patel dated 7 October 1948 in which he wrote, \\"With the taking over of the State forces by the Indian Government, it was agreed that steps would be taken to reorganise and rebuild our army so that when the present emergency is over and the Indian forces are withdrawn the State will be left with a proper organised army of its own to fall back upon.\\"Sandeep Bamzai (2006), p73 (Sheikh Abdullah has alleged that most of the Muslim soldiers of the Militia were either discharged or imprisoned before his arrest in 1953. The Militia (dubbed as Dagan Brigade) was converted from a State Militia to a regular unit of the Indian Army on 2 December 1972 and redesignated the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry)PIB Press release Press Information Bureau Govt of India 16 September 2004 Sheikh Abdullah spoke at the UN Security Council on 5 February 1948 thus: \\"The (tribal) raiders came to our land, massacred thousands of people ‚Äî mostly Hindus and Sikhs, but Muslims, too ‚Äî abducted thousands of girls, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims alike, looted our property and almost reached the gates of our summer capital, Srinagar.\\" =Prime minister= Sheikh Abdullah receiving Nehru in Srinagar, 1947. Sheikh Abdullah took oath as Prime Minister of Kashmir on 17 March 1948.Sandeep Bamzai (2006), p252 Return to activismArrest and release= On 8 August 1953 he was dismissed as Prime Minister by the then Sadr-i-Riyasat (Constitutional Head of State) Dr. Karan Singh, son of the erstwhile Maharajah Hari Singh, on the charge that he had lost the confidence of his cabinet (not the house). He was denied the opportunity to prove his majority on the floor of the house and his dissident cabinet minister Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed was appointed as Prime Minister. Sheikh Abdullah was immediately arrested and later jailed for eleven years, accused of conspiracy against the State in the infamous \\"Kashmir Conspiracy Case\\". According to Sheikh Abdullah his dismissal and arrest were engineered by the central government headed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He has quoted B.N. Mullicks' statements in his book \\"My Years with Nehru\\"B.N. Mullick (1972) in support of his statement. A.G. Noorani writing in Frontline supports this view, as according to him Nehru himself ordered the arrest.A.G. Noorani (2006) On 8 April 1964 the State Government dropped all charges in the so-called \\"Kashmir Conspiracy Case\\". Sheikh Abdullah was released and returned to Srinagar where he was accorded an unprecedented welcome by the people of the valley\\". After his release he was reconciled with Nehru. Nehru requested Sheikh Abdullah to act as a bridge between India and Pakistan and make President Ayub to agree to come to New Delhi for talks for a final solution of the Kashmir problem. President Ayub Khan also sent telegrams to Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah with the message that as Pakistan too was a party to the Kashmir dispute any resolution of the conflict without its participation would not be acceptable to Pakistan. This paved the way for Sheikh Abdullah's visit to Pakistan to help broker a solution to the Kashmir problem. Sheikh Abdullah went to Pakistan in spring of 1964. President Ayub Khan of Pakistan held extensive talks with him to explore various avenues for solving the Kashmir problem and agreed to come to Delhi in mid June for talks with Nehru as suggested by him. Even the date of his proposed visit was fixed and communicated to New Delhi. However, before Ayub Khan could make his visit, Nehru died on 27 May 1964. The Sheikh was en route to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir when he received the news. He addressed a public rally at Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and returned to Delhi. On his suggestion, President Ayub Khan sent a high level Pakistani delegation led by his Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto along with him to take part in the last rites of Jawaharlal Nehru. After Nehru's death in 1964, Sheikh Abdullah was again interned from 1965 to 1968. The internment was ordered by Lal Bahadur Shastri and continued by Indira Gandhi. The Plebiscite Front was also banned. This was allegedly done to prevent him and the Plebiscite Front which was supported by him from taking part in elections in Kashmir. Again, he was exiled from Kashmir in 1971-72 for 18 months, during which period the Indo-Pak war of 1971 came to be waged. =After Indo-Pakistan war and creation of Bangladesh= rightthumbSheikh Abdullah addressing a mammoth gathering at Lal Chowk Srinagar in 1975 In 1971,Bangladesh Liberation War broke out in erstwhile East Pakistan between Pakistan and Bangladesh joined later by India, and subsequently war broke out on the western border of India between India and Pakistan, both of which culminated in the creation of Bangladesh. Sheikh Abdullah watching the alarming turn of events in the subcontinent realised that for the survival of this region there was an urgent need to stop pursuing confrontational politics and promoting solution of issues by a process of reconciliation and dialogue rather than confrontation. Critics of Sheikh hold the view that he gave up the cherished goal of plebiscite for gaining Chief Minister's chair. He started talks with the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for normalising the situation in the region and came to an accord called 1974 Indira-Sheikh accord with Indira Gandhi, then India's Prime Minister, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in lieu of the people being given the right to self-rule by a democratically elected Government (as envisaged under article 370 of the Constitution of India) rather than the puppet government which till then ruled the State. Return to power Sheikh Abdullah's funeral processionHe assumed the position of Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. The Central Government and the ruling Congress Party withdrew its support so that the State Assembly had to be dissolved and mid term elections called. The National Conference won an overwhelming majority in the subsequent elections and re-elected Sheikh Abdullah as Chief Minister. He remained as Chief Minister till his death in 1982. Abdullah, described as a C. Bilqees Taseer, The Kashmir of Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah, p. 330Russel Brines, The Indo- Pakistani conflict, p. 67 to tall man,Hugh Tinker, \\"Accursed Paradise\\" in New Society, Volume 6, p.25 was fluent in both Kashmiri and Urdu. His biography in Urdu entitled Atish-e-Chinar was written by the noted Kashmiri author M.Y. Taing and published after Sheikh Abdullah's death. It is often referred to as his autobiography as Taing claimed that he only acted as an amanuensis. It is based on extensive interviews that Taing had with Sheikh Abdullah and provides valuable information on Sheikh Abdullah's family background, early life, ringside glimpses of happenings in Kashmir at a crucial juncture in its history, and his viewpoint about the political events in Kashmir in which he himself played a central role. After his death his eldest son Dr. Farooq Abdullah was elected as the Chief Minister of the State. Personal life In 1933 he married Akbar Jahan, the daughter of Michael Harry Nedou, of Slovak and British descent, and his Kashmiri wife Mirjan. Michael Harry Nedou was himself the proprietor of a hotel at the tourist resort of Gulmarg (The writer Tariq Ali claims that Akbar Jehan was previously married in 1928 to an Arab Karam Shah who disappeared after a Calcutta newspaper Liberty reported that he was actually T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia)Mubashhir Hassan (2008) a British Intelligence officer. He claims that Akbar Jehan was divorced by her first husband in 1929.)Tariq Ali (2003), p 230 CommentariesPakistani view= The government of Pakistan in 1947 viewed Abdullah and his party as agents of Nehru and did not recognise his leadership of Kashmir.Sandeep Bamzai (2006), p242. He spoke against Pakistani government in United Nations by comparing it with Hitler's rule, and he also endorsed Indian stand on Jammu and Kashmir. However, there was a change in Pakistan's viewpoint with the passage of time. When he visited Pakistan in 1964 he was awarded a tumultuous welcome by the people of Pakistan. Among the persons who received him was Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas his once colleague and later political enemy who earlier in his book Kashmakash had denounced Sheikh Abdullah as a turncoat and traitor. Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas embraced him and in his speech described him as one of the greatest leaders of the subcontinent and a great benefactor of the Muslims of the subcontinent.The WEEKLY \\"AAINA\\" 15 July 1970, p19 President Ayub Khan and his then Foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto discussed the Kashmir problem with him. The government of Pakistan treated him as a state guest. Sheikh Abdullah had the rare distinction of having poems in his praise written by three major Pakistani Urdu poets namely Hafeez Jullundhri, Josh and Faiz Ahmed Faiz who admired his lifelong struggle against injustice and for democratic rights of the common man.

Development The X-18 showing its elaborate engine configuration Design work started in 1955 by Stanley Hiller Jr and Hiller Aircraft Corporation received a manufacturing contract and funding from the U.S. Air Force to build the only X-18 ever produced, serialled 57-3078. To speed up construction and conserve money, the plane was constructed from scavenged parts including a Chase YC-122C Avitruc fuselage, 49-2883, and turboprops from the Lockheed XFV-1 and Convair XFY-1 Pogo experimental fighter programs. The tri-bladed contra-rotating propellers were a giant 16 ft (4.8 m) across. The Westinghouse turbojet engine had its exhaust diverted upwards and downwards at the tail to give the plane pitch control at low speeds. Hiller nicknamed their X-18 the Propelloplane for public relations purposes.\\"Hiller's Tiltwing Transport if Largest VTOL Transport.\\"Popular Mechanics, March 1959, p. 107. Service history The X-18 with partially rotated tiltwings Preliminary testing occurred at Moffett Field Naval Air Station, CA. The first flight (hop) was on 11/20/1959 followed by the first real flight on 11/24/1959 with Hiller test pilots George Bright and Bruce Jones. Further test flights were held at Edwards AFB, ultimately recording 20 flights. A number of problems plagued the X-18 including being susceptible to wind gusts when the wing rotated, acting like a sail. In addition the turboprop engines were not cross-linked, so the failure of one engine meant the airplane would crash. Thrust control was through throttle changes, which were too slow for acceptable height and roll control. On the 20th and final flight in July 1961, the X-18 had a propeller pitch control problem when attempting to convert to a hover at 10,000 ft and went into a spin. The crew regained control and landed, but the X-18 never flew again. However ground testing of the tiltwing concepts continued. Eventually a VTOL Test Stand was built on which the X-18's vertical takeoff and landing and hover control was to be tested. One engine run was successfully conducted to the full 15-foot wheel height on the VTOL Test Stand. The program was cancelled on January 18, 1964 before further VTOL Test Stand testing could be conducted, and the X-18 was cut up for scrap. The program proved several things that contributed to further tilt-wing VSTOL technology programs: #cross-shafting between the engines was necessary in order to avoid loss of control in the event of an engine failure. #direct propeller pitch control was necessary for precise height and lateral control during VTOL and hover. This knowledge was employed in the successful development and flight tests of the Tri-Service XC-142A, tilt-wing VSTOL transport.

The Ware is considered an irregular opening; it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. Opening idea The Ware Opening attacks the b5-square and prepares to bring the a1-rook into the game. The b5-square is non-essential and if Black plays 1...e5, the f8-bishop prevents the development of the white rook for the moment. The reply 1...e5 also gains space for Black in the center, a typical objective of most openings but one completely ignored by the Ware Opening. Noting all this, the Ware Opening is normally seen played only by players completely new to chess. An experienced player using the Ware Opening will usually meet a response of 1...d5 or 1...e5 with 2.d4 or 2.e4, respectively, since a reversed Scandinavian or Englund Gambit would be unsound here. After 1...d5 2.Nf3, 2...Nf6 is recommended, since a reversed Fajarowicz can arise after 2...c5 3.e4!? dxe4 4.Ne5 where a4 has some utility.Benjamin (1987), pp. 100‚Äì01. At some point the move a5 will be played, followed by Ra4 (as Ra3?? invites ...Bxa3 leaving Black up the exchange). In the 2012 World Blitz Championship, 1.a4 was employed as a little joke by Magnus Carlsen against Teimour Radjabov, who during the blitz championship two years earlier had told him \\"Everyone is getting tired. You might as well start with 1.a4 and you can still beat them.\\" The game soon turned into a sort of Four Knights Game where Carlsen finally prevailed. Variations There are several named variations of the Ware Opening. The best known of these are: * 1...e5 2.a5 d5 3.e3 f5 4.a6 (Ware Gambit). Schiller (1998), p. 475. In this variation, White attempts to create an open a-file in exchange for a pawn. * 1...e5 2.h4 (Crab Variation).

Methods The production of biologically interesting molecules using cloning and culturing methods allows the study and manufacture of relevant molecules. Except for excreted molecules, cells producing molecules of interest must be disrupted. This page discusses various methods. Another method of disruption is called cell unroofing. Bead method A common laboratory-scale mechanical method for cell disruption uses glass, ceramic or steel beads, 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter, mixed with a sample suspended in aqueous media. First developed by Tim Hopkins in the late 1970s, the sample and bead mix is subjected to high level agitation by stirring or shaking. Beads collide with the cellular sample, cracking open the cell to release intercellular components. Unlike some other methods, mechanical shear is moderate during homogenization resulting in excellent membrane or subcellular preparations. The method, often called \\"beadbeating\\", works well for all types of cellular material - from spores to animal and plant tissues. It is the most widely used method of yeast lysis, and can yield breakage of well over 50% (up to 95%). It has the advantage over other mechanical cell disruption methods of being able to disrupt very small sample sizes, process many samples at a time with no cross-contamination concerns, and does not release potentially harmful aerosols in the process. In the simplest example of the method, an equal volume of beads are added to a cell or tissue suspension in a test tube and the sample is vigorously mixed on a common laboratory vortex mixer. While processing times are slow, taking 3-10 times longer than that in specialty shaking machines, it works well for easily disrupted cells and is inexpensive. Successful beadbeating is dependent not only design features of the shaking machine (which take into consideration shaking oscillations per minute, shaking throw or distance, shaking orientation and vial orientation), but also the selection of correct bead size (0.1‚Äì6 mm diameter), bead composition (glass, ceramic, steel) and bead load in the vial. In most laboratories, beadbeating is done in batch sizes of one to twenty-four sealed, plastic vials or centrifuge tubes. The sample and tiny beads are agitated at about 2000 oscillations per minute in specially designed reciprocating shakers driven by high power electric motors. Cell disruption is complete in 1‚Äì3 minutes of shaking. Significantly faster rates of cell disruption are achieved with a beadbeater variation called SoniBeast. Differing from conventional machines, it agitates the beads using a vortex motion at 20,000 oscl/min. Larger beadbeater machines that hold deep-well microtiter plates also shorten process times, as do Bead Dispensers designed to quickly load beads into multiple vials or microplates.https://www.biospec.com/category/bead-loaders Pre-loaded vials and microplates are also available. All high energy beadbeating machines warm the sample about 10 degrees/minute. This is due to frictional collisions of the beads during homogenization. Cooling of the sample during or after beadbeating may be necessary to prevent damage to heat-sensitive proteins such as enzymes. Sample warming can be controlled by beadbeating for short time intervals with cooling on ice between each interval, by processing vials in pre-chilled aluminum vial holders or by circulating gaseous coolant through the machine during beadbeating. A different beadbeater configuration, suitable for larger sample volumes, uses a rotating fluorocarbon rotor inside a 15, 50 or 200 ml chamber to agitate the beads. In this configuration, the chamber can be surrounded by a static cooling jacket. Using this same rotor/chamber configuration, large commercial machines are available to process many liters of cell suspension. Currently, these machines are limited to processing monocellular organisms such as yeast, algae and bacteria. Cryopulverization Samples with a tough extracellular matrix, such as animal connective tissue, some tumor biopsy samples, venous tissue, cartilage, seeds, etc., are reduced to a fine powder by impact pulverization at liquid nitrogen temperatures. This technique, known as cryopulverization, is based on the fact that biological samples containing a significant fraction of water become brittle at extremely cold temperatures. This technique was first described by Smucker and Pfister in 1975, who referred to the technique as cryo-impacting. The authors demonstrated cells are effectively broken by this method, confirming by phase and electron microscopy that breakage planes cross cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes.Liquid Nitrogen Cryo-Impacting: a New Concept for Cell Disruption. Richard A. Smucker, Robert M. Pfister. Appl Microbiol. 1975 September; 30(3): 445‚Äì449. The technique can be done by using a mortar and pestle cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures, but use of this classic apparatus is laborious and sample loss is often a concern. Specialised stainless steel pulverizers generically known as Tissue Pulverizers are also available for this purpose. They require less manual effort, give good sample recovery and are easy to clean between samples. Advantages of this technique are higher yields of proteins and nucleic acids from small, hard tissue samples - especially when used as a preliminary step to mechanical or chemical/solvent cell disruption methods mentioned above. High Pressure Cell Disruption Since the 1940s high pressure has been used as a method of cell disruption, most notably by the French Pressure Cell Press, or French Press for short. This method was developed by Charles Stacy French and utilises high pressure to force cells through a narrow orifice, causing the cells to lyse due to the shear forces experienced across the pressure differential.The photochemical activity of isolated chloroplasts. C. S. French, H. W. Milner, M. L. Koenig, and F. D. H. Macdowall. Carn. Inst. Wash. Yearb. 1948; 47:91-93The photochemical reduction process in photosynthesis. In Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology. C. S. French, H. W. Milner. V. Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Photosynthesis. 232-250. Cambridge University Press, New York. While French Presses have become a staple item in many microbiology laboratories, their production has been largely discontinued, leading to a resurgence in alternate applications of similar technology. Modern physical cell disruptors typically operate via either pneumatic or hydraulic pressure. Although pneumatic machines are typically lower cost, their performance can be unreliable due to variations in the processing pressure throughout the stroke of the air pump. It is generally considered that hydraulic machines offer superior lysing ability, especially when processing harder to break samples such as yeast or Gram-positive bacteria, due to their ability to maintain constant pressure throughout the piston stroke. As the French Press, which is operated by hydraulic pressure, is capable of over 90% lysis of most commonly used cell types it is often taken as the gold standard in lysis performance and modern machines are often compared against it not only in terms of lysis efficiency but also in terms of safety and ease of use. Some manufacturers are also trying to improve on the traditional design by altering properties within these machines other than the pressure driving the sample through the orifice. One such example is Constant Systems, who have recently shown that their Cell Disruptors not only match the performance of a traditional French Press, but also that they are striving towards attaining the same results at a much lower power.Under Pressure, M. Lougher, European Biopharmaceutical Review, July 2016; 12-16 Pressure Cycling Technology (\\"PCT\\"). PCT is a patented, enabling technology platform that uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels (up to 90,000 psi) to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules in biological samples, e.g., the rupture (lysis) of cells and tissues from human, animal, plant, and microbial sources, and the inactivation of pathogens. PCT-enhanced systems (instruments and consumables) address some challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation. PCT advantages include: (a) extraction and recovery of more membrane proteins, (b) enhanced protein digestion, (c) differential lysis in a mixed sample base, (d) pathogen inactivation, (e) increased DNA detection, and (f) exquisite sample preparation process control.http://www.pressurebiosciences.com/documents?task=document.viewdoc&id;=64 The Microfluidizer method used for cell disruption strongly influences the physicochemical properties of the lysed cell suspension, such as particle size, viscosity, protein yield and enzyme activity. In recent years the Microfluidizer method has gained popularity in cell disruption due to its ease of use and efficiency at disrupting many different kinds of cells. The Microfluidizer technology was licensed from a company called Arthur D. Little and was first developed and utilized in the 1980s, initially starting as a tool for liposome creation. It has since been used in other applications such as cell disruption nanoemulsions, and solid particle size reduction, among others. By using microchannels with fixed geometry, and an intensifier pump, high shear rates are generated that rupture the cells. This method of cell lysis can yield breakage of over 90% of E. coli cells.Evaluation of the Microfluidizer for Cell Disruption of Yeast and Chlorella by E. Uera-Santos, C.D. Copple, EA Davis and WG. Hagar. Many proteins are extremely temperature- sensitive, and in many cases can start to denature at temperatures of only 4 degrees celsius. Within the microchannels, temperatures exceed 4 degrees celsius, but the machine is designed to cool quickly so that the time the cells are exposed to elevated temperatures is extremely short (residence time 25 ms-40 ms). Because of this effective temperature control, the Microfluidizer yields higher levels of active proteins and enzymes than other mechanical methods when the proteins are temperature-sensitive.agerkvist, Irene, and Sven-Olof Enfors.‚ÄùCharacterization Of E. Coli Cell Disintegrates from a Bead Bill and High Pressure Homogenizer.‚ÄùBiotechnology and bioengineering Biotechnol.Bioeng.36.11 (1990):1083-089.Web. Viscosity changes are also often observed when disrupting cells. If the cell suspension viscosity is high, it can make downstream handling‚Äîsuch as filtration and accurate pipetting‚Äîquite difficult. The viscosity changes observed with a Microfluidizer are relatively low, and decreases with further additional passes through the machine.agerkvist, Irene, and Sven-Olof Enfors.‚ÄùCharacterization Of E. Coli Cell Disintegrates from a Bead Bill and High Pressure Homogenizer.‚ÄùBiotechnology and bioengineering Biotechnol.Bioeng.36.11 (1990):1083-089.Web. In contrast to other mechanical disruption methods the Microfluidizer breaks the cell membranes efficiently but gently, resulting in relatively large cell wall fragments (450 nm), and thus making it easier to separate the cell contents. This can lead to shorter filtration times and better centrifugation separation.Evaluation of the Microfluidizer for Cell Disruption of Yeast and Chlorella by E. Uera-Santos, C.D. Copple, EA Davis and WG. Hagar. Microfluidizer technology scales from one milliliter to thousands of liters. Nitrogen decompression For nitrogen decompression, large quantities of nitrogen are first dissolved in the cell under high pressure within a suitable pressure vessel. Then, when the gas pressure is suddenly released, the nitrogen comes out of the solution as expanding bubbles that stretch the membranes of each cell until they rupture and release the contents of the cell. Nitrogen decompression is more protective of enzymes and organelles than ultrasonic and mechanical homogenizing methods and compares favorably to the controlled disruptive action obtained in a PTFE and glass mortar and pestle homogenizer. While other disruptive methods depend upon friction or a mechanical shearing action that generate heat, the nitrogen decompression procedure is accompanied by an adiabatic expansion that cools the sample instead of heating it. The blanket of inert nitrogen gas that saturates the cell suspension and the homogenate offers protection against oxidation of cell components. Although other gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and compressed air have been used in this technique, nitrogen is preferred because of its non-reactive nature and because it does not alter the pH of the suspending medium. In addition, nitrogen is preferred because it is generally available at low cost and at pressures suitable for this procedure. Once released, subcellular substances are not exposed to continued attrition that might denature the sample or produce unwanted damage. There is no need to watch for a peak between enzyme activity and percent disruption. Since nitrogen bubbles are generated within each cell, the same disruptive force is applied uniformly throughout the sample, thus ensuring unusual uniformity in the product. Cell- free homogenates can be produced. The technique is used to homogenize cells and tissues, release intact organelles, prepare cell membranes, release labile biochemicals, and produce uniform and repeatable homogenates without subjecting the sample to extreme chemical or physical stress. The method is particularly well suited for treating mammalian and other membrane-bound cells. It has also been used successfully for treating plant cells, for releasing virus from fertilized eggs and for treating fragile bacteria. It is not recommended for untreated bacterial cells. Yeast, fungus, spores and other materials with tough cell walls do not respond well to this method.

While Anderssen was defeated decisively in the match, the games he opened with this novelty scored 1¬Ω/3 (one win, one loss, one draw). As Anderssen's Opening is not commonly played, it is considered an irregular opening. The move is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. Discussion This opening move does little in the way of development or control of the center. In some cases, White can transpose the game to an opening where 1.a3 might have been useful, but using a tempo on such a move already on move one seems premature. In fact, this opening is based on the idea that White is playing with the black pieces, but he has the move 1.a3 already played. If a game starts 1.a3 e5 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3, Black cannot proceed in Ruy Lopez-fashion, and if Black plays 3...Bc5, then 4.Nf3 puts Black into the Two Knights' Defence and White's a3 precludes many possibilities. Anderssen's Opening is not a very constructive move for White and is instead more of a waiting move. Some players may enjoy the psychological value of such a move, however, or believe it will help them against an opponent with a superior knowledge of opening theory. Among the more common Black responses to Anderssen's Opening are: * 1...d5, which makes a straightforward claim on the center; * 1...g6, which prepares to fianchetto the bishop to g7 (since developing the bishop to b4 is unlikely) where it puts pressure on the slightly weakened queenside squares; * 1...e5 is also possible, but White can then play 2.c4, leading to a kind of Sicilian Defence with colors reversed, where a pawn on a3 can be useful. Another approach is 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3, transposing to Mengarini's Opening. Use A modern proponent of the move is Croatian International Master Dr. Zvonko Kreƒçak.Dr. Zvonko Kreƒçak games at ChessGames.com In March 2010 the then world number one Magnus Carlsen played the opening in the blindfold game against Vassily Ivanchuk at the Amber chess tournament.

Beer in Canada was introduced by European settlers in the seventeenth century. The first commercial brewery was La Brasseries due Roy [ _sic_ ] started by New France Intendant Jean Talon, in Qu√©bec City in 1668. Many commercial brewers thrived until Prohibition in Canada. The provincial and federal governments' attempt to eliminate \\"intoxicating\\" beverages led to the closing of nearly three quarters of breweries between 1878 and 1928. It was only in the second half of the twentieth century that a significant number of new breweries opened up. The Canadian beer industry now plays an important role in Canadian identity, though globalization of the brewing industry has seen the major players in Canada acquired by, or merged with, foreign companies, notably its three largest beer producers, Labatt, Molson and Sleeman. The result is that Moosehead, with an estimated 3.8 percent share of the domestic market in 2016, has become the largest fully Canadian-owned brewer. Beer sales have been sluggish overall in volume and in growth in industry revenue as other beverages have increased in popularity. Growth in revenue for beer makers averaged 1.3 per cent per year during 2011-2016; the estimated annual growth over the subsequent five years is only 0.4 percent per annum. Nonetheless, the number of licensed breweries in Canada increased from 310 in 2010 to 640 in 2015. Many of these are small operations since there were only 30 large (making over 7.5 million litres per year) breweries in 2015. The production of beer by microbreweries, or \\"craft brewing\\", is a very fast-growing segment both in terms of the number of producers and the volume sold. Craft brewing appeals to a wider demographic than the traditional mass- market beers which primarily target young males. (Men consume an estimated 71.5% of beer in terms of volume.) According to one expert, \\"The craft industry is attracting new consumers from different segments who would normally drink different things ... In other words: non-jock men and young women, who traditionally haven't been courted by beer marketers.\\" Due to the segment's growth, the major Canadian brewers have been acquiring small, local breweries. Popularity According to writer Stephen Beaumont (in his book Stephen Beaumont's Great Canadian Beer Guide) beer is an important aspect of the stereotypical Canadian. \\"Along with back bacon, winter and hockey, beer practically defines Canada,\\" he wrote. Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in Canada, in terms of both volume and dollar value. Industry statistics indicated that in 2015, beer was the country's most popular alcoholic beverage and the products brewed in Canada held an 85 per cent share of the domestic market. The top selling style of beer in Canada, by far, is the pale lager. This type is also called North American Style Lager (by the Canadian Brewing Awards, for example.) In 2016, the best-selling brand was Budweiser with its products manufactured in Canada. However, while Canada's population is growing, sales of beer has increased only minimally, according to a Statistics Canada March 2015 report. The volume of beer sold increased by only 1.7 per cent per year in the previous decade. Of that, domestic beer accounted for 1.1 per cent while imports made up the balance. In terms of market share in dollar value, beer's share dropped from 47.9 per cent to 42 per cent in ten years, mostly due to the increasing popularity of wine. Imported beer sales, in volume, have grown significantly, increasing at an annual average rate of 6.0% between 2004 and 2014. The annual Canadian Brewing Awards recognizes the best beers in Canada using blind taste tests. Most of the winners are craft beers. However, some were made by larger brewers; these included Moosehead's Alpine Lager and Cracked Canoe, and Molson Coors' Rickard's Red Session Lager and Rickard's Radler, Labatt's Blue Light and IPA from Alexander Keith's Brewery. For the 2017 competition, new rules allow for entries only from fully Canadian-owned breweries for the 55 categories of beer. History Beer was first introduced to Canada by European settlers in the seventeenth century, as Canada had an ideal climate for making beer before refrigeration was introduced. However, the preferred drink of the citizens of New France was imported wine or brandy. Although the first commercial brewery was built by Louis Prud'homme in Montreal (then Fort Ville-Marie) in 1650, it failed. Jean Talon, the first appointed Intendant of New France put limits on the amount of wine and spirits that could be imported and established the La brasserie de Roi in Quebec City, in the year 1668. This brewery also failed after Talon returned to France in 1672 and import limits were increased. What instead sprung up was the development of spruce beer, both alcoholic and non- alcoholic. After the fall of New France, the numerous British soldiers in the Canadian British colonies in the eighteenth century was a benefit to breweries since the troops were each entitled to six pints of beer per day. Most preferred ales and other heavy beers, not lager. Another important base of customers was the British Loyalists that immigrated from the newly independent United States to Canada. During those centuries and into the nineteenth, a number of commercial brewers thrived, including some that became the staple of the Canadian industry: John Molson founded a brewery in Montreal in 1786, Alexander Keith in Halifax in 1820, Thomas Carling in London in 1840, John Kinder Labatt in 1847, also in London, Susannah Oland in Halifax in 1867, and Eugene O'Keefe in Toronto in 1891. The Upper Canada government issued a patent on July 6, 1842, to George Riley of Kingston, Upper Canada for \\"an improved method of brewing ale, beer, porter, and other malt liquors.\\" Molson's is the oldest surviving Canadian brewing enterprise. Prohibition in Canada did not last as long as in the U.S. and was largely over by the mid-1920s apart from Prince Edward Island, where it ran from 1901 to 1948. By comparison, the Temperance Act in Ontario ran from 1916 to 1927. Surprisingly, the relatively large and powerful beer manufacturing sector - and the huge working class that purchased their products - failed to convince any of the provincial governments to reverse their stance on prohibition. After the ending of prohibition, the sale of beverage alcohol products remained heavily controlled by government liquor boards and publicly owned stores in each of the provinces. Public drinking returned to jurisdictions often several years after the end of prohibition. The controls led to the growth of \\"beer parlours\\" also known as \\"taverns\\" which had no bar, did not serve meals and people sat and drank at cafe tables, where the beer was delivered by the glass, patrons could not move between tables, could not stand up with a drink and had other restrictions. Many beer parlours were segregated by sex, and had a men's only room, and a room for \\"ladies and escorts.\\" The beer parlours, where often the only thing you could do was to drink and was often the only place to drink in town is considered a factor in making beer a national drink of Canada. A period of consolidation occurred after the ending of prohibition and the brewing industry became extremely concentrated in Canada by the 1960s, dominated by just three companies ( Canadian Breweries, Molson and Labatt). Together, all three had bought or merged dozens of smaller breweries, sometimes moving their products to another brewery plant or closed outright. =Foreign ownership and consolidation= In 1969, Canadian Breweries was sold to the Rothmans International multinational and renamed Carling O'Keefe. After a brief ownership by Australian Elders XL, Carling O'Keefe merged with Molson in 1989, then merged with US company Coors in 2005 to create Molson Coors, now the world's fifth-largest brewing company. Labatt's was purchased in 1995 by the Belgian company Interbrew (now part of Brazilian-Belgian Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewing company). With the purchase of Sleeman Breweries, the largest remaining Canadian brewer, in 2006 by the Japanese owned Sapporo Brewery, Canada's beer production has been mainly under the control of multinational companies, mostly foreign-owned. By the end of 2006, nearly 90 per cent of beer sales was of product brewed domestically under license from non-domestic corporations. American beers brewed under license have become the top sellers in the market, and by 2008 Budweiser was the top- selling brand with 13 per cent of the market, followed by Coors Light with 12 per cent. Molson Canadian and Labatt Blue, for decades the top-selling brands, now hold third and fourth place. According to Agriculture Canada, the three major breweries accounted for approximately 90 per cent of retail sales in 2012. While annual exports, primarily to the U.S. are significant, industry analysts expect a decline at an annualized rate of 1.6 per cent starting in 2016, due to the increasing popularity of U.S. brewed products. As well, Canada was a net importer of beer in 2014, with imports totalling million (including 24 per cent from the U.S.) against exports of million. A merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller closed on October 10, 2016. The new company, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, is trading on the Brussels Stock Exchange as ABI.BR and as BUD on the New York stock exchange. SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of SABMiller, including the Miller brand portfolio. Molson Coors now owns all of MillerCoors; the latter is \\"the U.S. business unit of Molson Coors\\". As a result, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite in Canada. The largest fully Canadian-owned brewer, Moosehead Breweries, controlled about 3.8 per cent of the Canadian market in 2016. =Growth of microbreweries= The revival of craft brewing dates from the early 1980s, according to Ian Coutts, in his book Brew North: How Canadians Made Beer and Beer Made Canada as a result of disparate and random factors. The factors included an article in May/June 1978 issue of Harrowsmith magazine by a former O'Keefe employee decrying the state of the business, the creation of the Campaign for Real Ale in the United Kingdom, the revival of smaller brewers in the United States beginning with Anchor Brewing in 1965, the 1981 deregulation of beer prices in British Columbia by minister Peter Hyndman and the resulting price hikes by the \\"Big Three\\". In June 1982, the Horseshoe Bay Brewery in West Vancouver opened, creating one of Canada's first microbreweries. Despite the dominance of the foreign-controlled major brewers, the numbers of microbreweries has been increasing. There were 88 microbreweries in 2006. There was a 50 per cent increase in the number of independents between 2010 and 2015. By that year, there were 640 licensed breweries in Canada. That number may be as high as it will go. The trend is that as one microbrewery closes another opens to take its place. Craft beer sales are increasing. In Ontario (the province with the largest population) for example, there was a minimal increase in sales volume for the majors' products while craft beer sales increased by nearly 36 per cent in 2015. Beer produced by microbreweries (\\"craft beer\\") accounted for 10% of the Canadian beer market in 2015, and the microbrewery industry has been experiencing rapid growth. The growth, particularly in sales volume, is particularly noteworthy in Ontario, where craft brewers experienced a 36 per cent increase in sales in 2015. In mid-2016, there were 140 such breweries operating in Ontario. British Columbia's craft beer industry has also experienced major growth, from 54 in 2010 to 118 such operations in 2015. These small British Colubia breweries benefitted from a 35% increase in the volume of beer produced in 2016 vs. 2015. On a Canada-wide basis, demand for craft beer is steadily increasing and the maturity point (peak) for this industry is still a long way off, according to Taps magazine, published by the parent of the Canadian Brewing Awards. One way the foreign-owned \\"macrobreweries\\" have dealt with the threat of this slow but steady growth of Canadian craft brewers is by buying them outright. For example, Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario was bought by Molson Coors in 2005, and Creemore subsequently acquired Granville Island Brewing in 2010. Mill Street Brewery of Toronto, Ontario, was purchased by Labatt in late 2015; after the acquisition had been completed, Mill St purchased Brickworks Ciderhouse and brought it under the Labatt umbrella of companies as well. In October 2015, Labatt had also purchased Turning Point Brewery, a craft beer maker in Delta, BC that brews Stanley Park beers. Other craft beers owned by major companies include Hop City owned by Moosehead, Unibroue and Upper Canada Brewing Company owned by Sleeman (and hence Sapporo). Styles In most of Canada, the most popular types are pale lagers like Molson Canadian and Labatt Blue from the big breweries. In Quebec and the Maritimes, lager-like ales such as Molson Export and Alexander Keith's are also popular. =Indigenous and semi-indigenous Canadian styles=Cream ale Although cream ale (referring to a creamy head) was an offshoot of North American light lager, this type is brewed as an ale, in accordance with individual brewers' preferences. Despite its name, a cream ale does not include lactose. One definition from the US suggests that cream ale in North America is \\"somewhat of a hybrid ... fermented like an ale at warm temperatures, but then stored at cold temperatures for a period of time, much as a lager would be. The resultant brew has the unchallenging crisp characteristics of a light pale lager, but is endowed with a hint of the aromatic complexities that ales provide. Pale in color, they are generally more heavily carbonated and more heavily hopped than light lagers.\\" In the US, this type can also include Kentucky common beer or cream beer, although this version is rarely brewed commercially today. The cream ale from Kilkenny (beer) in Ireland bears no resemblance to North American made cream ales. It is similar to Guinness with a nitrogenated cream head, but with \\"50% less carbonation than regular beers\\". The most widely distributed brand in Canada is the Sleeman Cream Ale - first crafted in the late 1800s by George Sleeman and possibly the first genuine iteration of Canadian cream ale. Sleeman Breweries current product, \\"crafted from ... the original Sleeman family recipe book\\" is described by the maker as \\"an authentic North American style [that] combines the easy drinking nature of a lager and the rich fruity character of an ale\\". Muskoka Brewery (a large craft brewer with 130 employees) also markets a cream ale across Ontario (at LCBO and The Beer Store), as do some smaller brewers. Muskoka describes its product as \\"... with its rich amber colour and inviting floral tones, ... a Cascade hoppiness and fuller body of flavour, ...\\". Naturally, craft brewers' products, especially from other provinces‚Äîsuch as Montreal's McAuslan Cream Ale and Vancouver's R&B; Raven Cream Ale‚Äîare entirely different in most aspects. Ice beer Ice beer originated in Canada, although it is essentially based on the German Eisbock style of beer. The first ice beer marketed in the United States was \\"Molson Ice\\" which was introduced in April 1993, although the process was patented earlier by Labatt, instigating the so-called \\"Ice Beer Wars\\" of the 1990s. Common ice beer brands in Canada in 2017, with approximately 5.5 to 6 per cent alcohol content, include Carling Ice, Molson Keystone Ice, Busch Ice, Old Milwaukee Ice, Brick's Laker Ice and Labatt Ice. There is a Labatt Maximum Ice too, with 7.1 per cent alcohol content. One generic process of icing beer involves lowering the temperature of a batch of beer until ice crystals form. Since alcohol has a much lower freezing point (-114 ¬∞C; -173.2 ¬∞F) than water and doesn't form crystals when the ice is filtered off. This creates a concoction with a higher volume ratio of alcohol to water and therefore creating a beer with a higher alcohol content by volume. The process is known as \\"fractional freezing\\" or \\"freeze distillation\\". Labatt patented a specific method for making ice beer in 1997, 1998 and 2000 which is described as: \\"A process for chill-treating, which is exemplified by a process for preparing a fermented malt beverage wherein brewing materials are mashed with water and the resulting mash is heated and wort separated therefrom. The wort is boiled cooled and fermented and the beer is subjected to a finishing stage, which includes ageing, to produce the final beverage. The improvement comprises subjecting the beer to a cold stage comprising rapidly cooling the beer to a temperature of about its freezing point in such a manner that ice crystals are formed therein in only minimal amounts. The resulting cooled beer is then mixed for a short period of time with a beer slurry containing ice crystals, without any appreciable collateral increase in the number of ice crystals in the resulting mixture. Finally, the so-treated beer is extracted from the mixture.\\" The company provides the following explanation for the layman: \\"During this unique process, the temperature is reduced until fine ice crystals form in the beer. Then using an exclusive process, the crystals are removed. The result is a full-flavoured balanced beer.\\" Since 1994 a small craft brewery called Old Credit Brewing in Port Credit, Mississauga has been making an ice aged beer. This process involves fermenting the beer at a lower temperature than other products and then ageing it for eight weeks between -2 and -2.5 ¬∞C. This helps to remove the bitter aftertaste, give clarity of flavour, and increase the shelf life of the beer. Unlike other processes, ice crystals are not formed in order to keep the alcohol content at 5% ABV. The final product is a smooth, easy-drinking craft beer. There is a much older German process called Eisbock. \\"By cooling beer to just below freezing, you separate out a large portion of water from the alcohol, which has a lower freezing point. You then skim off the ice crystals from the brew leaving behind a beer that is twice as potent as the original.\\" That produces a beer with 12 to 15 per cent alcohol. In North America, water would be added to lower the alcohol level. Spruce beer Spruce beer originated in 16th- century New France, initially as a method for preventing scurvy. The Huron and other First Nations groups living along the St. Lawrence were likely the first people to brew it; their recipes were later combined with the settlers' fermenting and yeasting practices. The primary benefit of spruce beer or 'epinette' was to prevent scurvy; it was used for that purpose by Jacques Cartier and his explorers when they arrived in Stadacona in what is now Quebec in 1535. Within a few decades of settlement, it had evolved into a formal style of beer, more commonly consumed by Canadians than any ale or lager, or indeed any kind of wine or spirit in Canada. It was still commonplace until the 1960s in Quebec but is now largely restricted to a select few microbreweries and restaurants, such as Garrison Brewery in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic varieties exist, although the latter is now the most common by far. Ironically, despite the immense popularity of beer in Quebec and in Canada generally, the non-alcoholic \\"soda\\" version has maintained a more widespread appeal. The commercial versions are alcohol-free but spruce beer is often home-brewed in bathtubs and bottled on rooftops in order to allow the sunlight to aid with natural fermentation. Although commercial production of this non-alcoholic style has grown in recent years, the main provider is still famed casse-croute restaurant Paul Patates in Montreal - using a recipe dating from 1896. Notwithstanding its relative obscurity, spruce beer is an authentic Canadian style of beer, as well as one of the oldest forms of beer in North America. In addition to its unique main ingredient of spruce tips, epinette is also distinguished from other styles of beer from its use of a top-fermented yeast with no malt whatsoever, the addition of toasted bread as well as roasted grain in stages during the brewing process, for its short, in-barrel fermentation period of 24 hours, and for the use of maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses or birch syrup as flavouring agents. Epinette is also typically unhopped. =Light beer= In the US, light beer sales are close to 50% of the total, while in Canada such beer constitutes under 30% of consumption. In fact, Plato Logic, a beer marketing specialist, estimated in August 2015 that such beer totals only 20 per cent of total volume of sales but adds that this category has been growing at 2.1 per cent annually over the past five years. Although the alcohol level is also lower, usually 4 percent vs. 5 percent for regular beer, the primary appeal of light beer is the calorie count but also the light almost 'non-beer' taste [for some consumers] and the successful marketing campaigns\\".\\"BEER STYLES 101: LIGHT LAGER\\". http://www.tapsmagazine.com/beer-styles-101-light-lager/. Taps Magazine. Taps Media. September 1, 2016. Retrieved January 15, 2017.

(According to the organizers, \\"This competition is judged by approximately 40 Certified Beer Judges (BJCP) who consider five criteria: aroma, appearance, flavour, mouth-feel, and overall impression when judging the beer\\".) =Craft brewing= There is no consistent definition of a craft brewery or microbrewery across Canada. In fact, the various provincial governments only define categories such as small brewery, microbrewery, macro brewery and nano brewery, with each classification depending on the number of hectolitres produced and that number varies from province to province. Still, most of the craft brewers tend to be small and locally owned, often by families. Some such breweries have been sold to major corporations but they are still referred to as craft brewers by most news media; after such a change in ownership, however, they may no longer qualify as members of the Provincial craft brewers associations. Most microbrewers sell a small number of beer brands and often specialize in types or styles. Some of these also brew cider, a fermented fruit drink. Depending on the province, off-site retail sales may be limited to government-regulated retailers. Some operate solely as brewpubs, their entire output only for sale on-site. Bottle sales predominate among microbreweries, including the large Growler (jug). Increasingly, craft brewers are packaging at least some of their products in aluminum cans. For example, Ottawa's Beyond The Pale Brewing Co. once used only bottles, including one- and two-litre growlers, but the company added a canning system in 2015. \\"If you are trying to put out a premium product, it's better for the beer to be in cans. It's more convenient, it's better for the environment, it makes a lot of sense,\\" said co-owner Rob McIsaac. Most of their beer is now sold in cans. Cameron's Brewing Company in Mississauga, Ontario, also sell the majority of their beer in cans. Craft brewer Black Bridge in Saskatchewan is strongly in favour of cans, due to the lower weight (\\"we can transport more beer while reducing our carbon footprint\\") and much greater resistance to light and oxygen that can reduce shelf life in addition to lower packaging and shipping costs. Three provinces provided major support to small brewers in 2015. Ontario invested million to assist 20 craft breweries in expanding and in marketing. B.C. announced million in support to their breweries through a 25 per cent reduction in the provincial liquor distribution board's mark-up for local beers. Alberta's new grant program was expected to provide million in assistance to craft brewers. The first contemporary Canadian craft brewer was Horseshoe Bay Brewing, founded in Vancouver in 1982. This was followed by many others, including Spinnakers Brewpub in Victoria (1984), Vancouver Island Brewery in Victoria (1984), Granville Island Brewing of Vancouver (1984), Brick Brewery of Waterloo (1984), Connor's Brewery of Mississauga (1984), Granite Brewery of Halifax (1985), Wellington Brewery of Guelph (1985), Big Rock Brewery of Calgary (1985), Upper Canada Brewing Company of Toronto (1985), McAuslan Brewing of Montreal (1989), Old Credit Brewing of Mississauga (1994), Muskoka Springs Brewery (1995), Neustadt Springs Brewery (1997), La Barberie of Quebec City (1997) and Steam Whistle Brewing of Toronto (2000). Microbreweries and brewpubs have continued to expand since. Brewing in Canada's regions Jason Foster, a beer columnist for CBC Radio One's Radio Active and Vue Weekly and the creator of onbeer.org, argues that Canadian regional styles of craft brewing reflect the history and culture of those regions, often based on the origins of the people who settled there. He argues, for example, that Atlantic Canada is associated with the British styles and Quebec with Belgian styles due to their settlement history. Ontario has a more \\"mainstream\\", \\"conservative\\" style ‚Äî with German and eastern American influences. British Columbia has an \\"eccentric\\" style, influenced by the U.S. West Coast, with a noted presence of fruit beers and organic beers drawing from that region's culture of environmentalism. However, it makes little sense to say that Canadian beer is merely the sum of its parts, or takes all of its influence from other styles. Brands like Molson Export, Moosehead and Sleeman, for example, led the way in crafting a softer and more palatable style of ale and lager for North American audiences, while still retaining strength. For example, Canadian-style ales - pale or dark - tend to be maltier than their American equivalents and more bitter than their English cousins. While taste is subjective, an overview of beer enthusiasts' favourite Canadian beers is a good way to get a sense of the most highly regarded breweries in the country. According to Beer Advocate, a ratings website frequented by beer enthusiasts, as of 2012 46 of Canada's top 100 beers were brewed in Quebec, 25 in British Columbia, 13 in Ontario, 6 in Alberta, 4 in Manitoba, 4 in Nova Scotia, and 2 in Yukon. =Atlantic provinces= Moosehead Breweries Limited is Canada's oldest independent brewery, located in Saint John, New Brunswick. The brewery was founded in 1867 and is privately owned and operated by the Oland family. All four of the top 100 Beer Advocate Canadian beers brewed in Atlantic Canada are brewed in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Three of these are made by Propeller, and one by Garrison. By 2017, there were at least 41 microbreweries throughout Nova Scotia alone.Nova Scotia Liquour Commission, \\"Get to Know Beer \\", 2017, p. 16. Retrieved October 9, 2017. That year, there were also 25 hop growers in the Maritime Provinces (part of the Atlantic provinces), and they were producing some 25 varieties of hops.Maritime Hop Growers Co-Operative: About Us . Retrieved October 9, 2017. =Quebec= 46 of the top 100 beers in Canada are brewed in Quebec, according to Beer Advocate. The ratings are led by Dieu du Ciel of Montreal (with 17), and followed by Unibroue of Chambly (10), Microbrasserie Charlevoix of Baie- Saint-Paul (7), Les Trois Mousquetaires of Brossard (5), McAuslan Brewing of Montreal (3), and Le Trou Du Diable of Shawinigan, L'Am√®re √† Boire of Montreal, Brasseurs Illimit√©s of Saint-Eustache, and Hopfenstark of L'Assomption, with one each. The Mondial de la Bi√®re was founded in 1994 in Montreal and attracts around 80,000 people, while Quebec City held its first beer festival, the Festibi√®re,Festibi√®re de Qu√©bec/ in 2009. =Ontario= Including the major's production plants, there were roughly 188 breweries in this province in 2016. Of beers brewed in Canada, 13 of the 100 top-ranked beers were brewed in Ontario in 2011, according to user-submitted ratings on the website Beer Advocate. Barnstormer Brewing and Distilling brews three of these, BrewBlack Oak of Etobicoke brews three of these, followed by Denison's of Toronto, Muskoka Cottage Brewery of Bracebridge, and Wellington of Guelph with two apiece. Flying Monkeys of Barrie,\\"LCBO grounds Flying Monkeys beer\\". Barrie Examiner, April 4, 2011. Spearhead of Etobicoke, Creemore Springs of Creemore, and Great Lakes of Etobicoke (not to be confused with Great Lakes of Cleveland) brew one top beer apiece. About 80% of Ontario's consumer beer trade is handled by The Beer Store, a government-instituted, privately owned monopoly founded in 1927 as Brewer's Retail. The chain is owned by Anheuser- Busch InBev (of Belgium), Molson Coors (incorporated in the United StatesMolsonCoors 2008 SEC 1O-K filing), and Sapporo Brewery (of Japan). This unique situation has enabled these companies to earn an estimated one billion dollars in profit per year. The other 20% is handled by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), a Crown corporation. Smaller brewers, which tend to focus on German and English styles, are represented by the Ontario Craft Brewers trade association. The Beer Store's share will decrease over time. In December 2016, some 60 supermarkets were given a license to sell six packs and this is expected to increase to over 150 such locations during 2017. The Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest is a nine-day event in Kitchener-Waterloo, which started in 1969 influenced by the original German Oktoberfest. It is held every October, starting on the Friday before Canadian Thanksgiving and running until the Saturday after. The event has had an exclusive sponsorship agreement with Molson Coors for some years. Since craft brewers cannot participate, the Waterloo-Wellington Craft Collective started their own Kitchener-Waterloo event, Craftoberfest, in 2016 , serving beers from over 20 small, independent brewers. Toronto's Festival of Beer was first held in 1995 at Fort York in Toronto and has been held at Exhibition Place since 2009. In 2011, the Toronto Festival of Beer also launched the Queer Beer Festival, a separate one-day event marketed toward Toronto's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\\"Queer Beer Festival hits Toronto in August\\". fab, May 9, 2011. There is also the Lauder Beer Festival, which is a much smaller festival held in the north end of Toronto. A beer festival also took place in Ottawa in 2003. Beau's All Natural Brewing Company, located in Vankleek Hill, is the host company of Oktoberfest in the Ottawa area. The 2011 edition was a sellout, drawing an estimated 8,500-9,000 guests over the course of three days. The Golden Tap Awards is an annual beer awards event held in Toronto. The awards are sponsored and presented by The Bar Towel, a website and forum dedicated to the discussion and promotion of Toronto's craft and microbrew beer scene. In 2010, the Ontario Craft Brewers, the association of \\"small, local, independently-owned craft breweries\\" started Ontario Craft Beer Week, a week-long craft beer celebration across the province. This event gets funding from the Government of Ontario. New microbreweries established in the 2010s have included All or Nothing Brewhouse in Oshawa, Barnstormer Brewing Company in Barrie, Bellwoods Brewery in Toronto, Left Field Brewery in Toronto, Refined Fool Brewing Co. in Sarnia, Stack Brewing in Sudbury,\\"Success is sweet for Sudbury‚Äôs Stack Brewing\\".

Craft beer sales are increasing in Ontario. In 2015 for example, there was a minimal increase in sales volume for the majors' products while craft beer sales increased by nearly 36 per cent in that year. The provincial government is helping small breweries to expand. For example, in January 2017, it announced a $562,000 funding programme. The recipients included Beau's, Bellwoods, Hockley Valley, Haliburton Highlands, Oast House, Toboggan Brewing, StoneHammer, and Wellington. =Prairies= Of the Beer Advocate Top 100 Canadian beers, four brews each are made by Half Pints of Winnipeg and Alley Kat of Edmonton, and one by Wild Rose of Calgary. Great Western Brewing Company and Paddock Wood are based in Saskatoon. Alberta is the only jurisdiction in Canada which has no government involvement in the beer retail, import, and warehousing industries. Alberta has also opened, as of 2013, Olds College Brewery, which hosts the Olds College Brewmaster and Brewery Operations Management course, the second of its kind in Canada. Alberta has been host to several microbreweries, including Big Rock Brewery founded 1985, Alley Kat and Wild Rose Brewery both founded 1996, and a plethora (now over 20) of brewpubs, microbreweries and smaller craft breweries opened since. Calgary is home to a majority of the breweries in Alberta. It boasts large revenue-generating marketing powerhouses like Big Rock and Minhas Brewery, while also having several enthusiastic mid-sized craft breweries like Tool Shed, Village Brewery, and exciting new smaller brewers like Last Best (A member of the Bear Hill Brewing Companies) and Calgary's only nano-brewery: The Dandy Brewing Company. The opening of the Olds College Brewmaster program means that a large number of domestically trained brewers will be added to Canada's brewing industry. Beer styles commonly brewed in the Prairies include types/styles such as lagers, blondes, pale ales and ambers, IPAs, malt forward beers including porters and stouts as well as many filtered and unfiltered, fruited or standard wheat beers. =British Columbia= The British Columbia craft beer industry has seen major growth since 2010 when there were 54 small breweries; by 2015 there were 118 such operations. Victoria and Vancouver are the two most dense areas in which breweries can be found with additional breweries opening every year. The over 100 small BC breweries benefitted from a 35% increase in the volume of beer produced in 2016 vs. 2015. In 2013 the BC Beer Awards recognized the top craft beer to be produced in the province and adorned top breweries such as Central City, Steamworks, Phillips, Townsite, Fernie, Lighthouse, High Mountain, Yaletown, Coal Harbour and Vancouver Island with Gold Medals for their beers in a broad range of categories. The rapid growth of the BC Beer industry resembles that of Portland OR more than a decade ago and the rapid growth is helping to spur on local social-economies as well as grow the tourism opportunities around craft beer. 25 of the top 100 beers in Canada are brewed in British Columbia according to Beer Advocate. Driftwood Brewing of Victoria, followed by Central City Brewers & Distillers of Surrey and Phillips Brewing & Malting Co. of Victoria with four each, Howe Sound Brewing of Squamish, and Crann√≥g Ales of Sorrento, Old Yale Brewing Co. of Chilliwack, Russell Brewing Company of Surrey, Tree Brewing Co. of Kelowna, Lighthouse Brewing Company of Victoria, Spinnaker's Brewpub of Victoria and Parallel 49 Brewing of Vancouver with one apiece. The Great Canadian Beer Festival has, since 1993 (with help from the Victoria chapter of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)), focused on cask ales from the Pacific Northwest. Since 2003 the festival has been held at Royal Athletic Park on the first weekend after Labour Day. The festival attracts over 40 craft breweries from across Canada and the Pacific North-western USA and more than 8000 visitors. In 2010, a group of craft beer enthusiasts started Vancouver Craft Beer Week, the first \\"beer week\\"-type festival in Canada, a format that was begun in Philadelphia in 2008. The event has grown significantly since its inception. In 2016, over 100 breweries presented over 350 beers at VCBW, held at the PNE Fairgrounds. The ten-day 2017 event (May 26 to June 4) expects a similar number of breweries, plus four stages with live music and DJs, food trucks, market stalls, brewing demonstrations, a games area and other attractions. The event was the Winner of the 2016 Golden Owl Hospitality Awards Social Event of the Year, the Georgia Straight's 2015 & 2016 Golden Plate Award for Best Beer Festival/Event, and is a six time CAMRA YVR Event of the Year award winner. Regulations Government regulations require that all beer sold in Canada show the alcohol by volume on the label. A standard bottle of beer ( and five per cent alcohol by volume) which makes 21.6 mL of alcohol (17.05 g). The percentage of alcohol is expressed in mass per volume (g/100 ml) so it means grams of alcohol per 100 ml of solution (fluid in the bottle). It means that a 78.9% alcohol liquid would be pure, meaning only pure ethanol. In most nations, the labelled alcohol percentage is either the average or maximum percentage allowed. However, as of 1927, most Canadian provinces require the minimum alcohol percentage to be labelled rather than the average. This move was meant to eliminate inaccurate nonalcoholic labeling as well as fraudulent advertisement.Decisions: Alcohol - Canadian Food Inspection Agency The purchase and transport of beer between provinces is controlled by provincial liquor law. Exemptions under specified amounts are given for personal consumption, but most jurisdictions do not allow the direct importation of other provinces' beer products directly (a similar situation exists for wine and liquor). An agreement was reached in 2018 between the provinces to increase the personal exemption. Draft beer (or draught beer) in Canada, when advertised as a \\"pint\\", is legally required to be . With the allowed margin of error of 0.5 fluid ounces, a \\"pint\\" which is less than 554 ml of beer is an offence, though - to the detriment of consumers - this regulation is often violated and rarely enforced. In several provinces, draft beer can also be purchased by individuals in kegs. In Ontario, for example, The Beer Store offers 70 different brands in three keg sizes, 20 litres, 30 litres and 58.6 litres. Prior to 1961, Canadian beer was sold, and served, in two sizes, colloquially known as \\"quarts\\" and \\"pints\\", or \\"large\\" and \\"small\\". They were 22 and 12 imperial fluid ounces (625 and 341 mL), respectively, whereas a true imperial quart was 40 fluid ounces. Over the years, some provinces banned the sale of beer in the larger bottle. For example, in Ontario in the 1950s only the pint could be sold, but in Quebec, both sizes were about equally common. In 1961, both sizes were replaced, nationwide, by the standardized bottle, equal in volume to the \\"small\\" and affectionately known as the \\"stubby\\". Some years later, however, Ontario (like some other provinces) began to allow the sale of \\"tall boy\\" cans containing 740ml of beer. Over 50 per cent of beer in Canada is now sold in cans. Most Canadian craft brewers sell the majority of their beer in cans, often canned by third party mobile canning companies to reduce costs. Stubbies are a type of bottle which is shorter and with a slightly larger diameter than the now predominant longneck bottle. Starting in 1962 almost all beer in Canada was sold in stubbies (with 341ml of content) until the beer companies chose to switch to the American-style longneck bottle, between 1982 and 1986. The last major label to be available in the stubby was Labatt's Crystal which switched to the longneck in the summer of 1986. Brick Brewery of Waterloo began selling Red Cap Ale in stubbies as recently as the mid 2000s, although this may no longer be the case. At least a few craft breweries also use this bottle format.

It is part of Siuslaw National Forest and is administered by the United States Forest Service. The Oregon Dunes are a unique area of windswept sand. They are the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America and one of the largest expanses of temperate coastal sand dunes in the world, with some dunes reaching above sea level. They are the product of millions of years of erosion by wind and rain on the Oregon Coast. The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area provides numerous recreational activities, including off-highway vehicle (OHV) use, hiking, photography, fishing, canoeing, horseback riding, and camping. The Carter Dunes Trail and Oregon Dunes Day Use provide forest access for the disabled. Frank Herbert's science-fiction novel Dune was inspired (in part) by the author's research and fascination with the area.The Road to Dune (2005), p. 264, letter by Frank Herbert to his agent Lurton Blassingame outlining \\"They Stopped the Moving Sands.\\"  History  The Oregon Dunes are over 100,000 years old and stretch approximately . The youngest dunes, which are the closest to the ocean, began forming about 7,000 years ago. Studies of individual sand grains show that these sands were carried down from the mountains by the Umpqua, Siuslaw, and other smaller rivers. In 1963, Congressman Robert B. Duncan introduced a bill to establish a national seashore at the Oregon Dunes; it unanimously passed the Senate Interior Committee. Senator Wayne Morse opposed provisions of the bill that increased environmental protections by restricting property uses. In 1972 Congress set aside of the total dune area as the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The actual dunes are managed by the U.S. Forest Service, while the remaining area is private or county land.  Geology  The sand dunes were formed by wind and water over time. The dune formation is mainly dependent on the wind. In the summer the wind blows from the north and northwest at . Mountain barriers near the coast deflect the wind currents, forming the sand into many different shapes. In the winter the winds are much slower (except during storms when the winds can reach up to ), coming from the south and southwest. These winds move large amounts of sand, reshaping the dunes' structure. Water also plays a role in dune formation. Waves and tides dredge sand from the ocean floor and deposit it onto the beaches, where the wind takes over. The water currents also create marshy areas where standing water is several feet deep. Upward pressure causes the sand grains to become saturated and float. This process results in quicksand. Quicksand is found in the low, unvegetated areas between the dunes. The barrage lakes are the largest lakes in Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. They were formed when streams flowing west from the Coast Range foothills were dammed up by the rapidly developing dunes.  Plants and animals  Plants = Stable native plant species are vital to the success of the dunes ecosystem. Several native plants and plant groups have been identified as crucial and are part of active management and conservation efforts. These plants include red fescue, Port Orford cedar, evergreen huckleberry, seashore bluegrass, shore pine, hairy manzanita, bearberry, bog blueberry, tufted hairgrass, slough sedge, Sitka spruce, and skunk cabbage.Christy, John A., \\"Rare Plant Associations, Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, Sutton Recreation Area, and Heceta Sand Dunes ACEC/ONA\\" (2013). Institute for Natural Resources Publications. 7. Original native plant species were drastically reduced over the years due to the planting of European beachgrass, Scotch broom and shore pine for sand stabilization that occurred from 1910 through 1979. = Birds = Least sandpiper Many species of birds live in the varied habitats of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The South Jetty area includes beach, marsh, and coastal wetlands where the tundra swan, marsh wren, Canada goose, yellow-rumped warbler, red-tailed hawk, sanderling, long-billed curlew, dunlin, and least sandpiper make their home. The great blue heron, American bittern, green heron, Virginia rail, cinnamon teal, common yellowthroat, common merganser, belted kingfisher, snowy plover, bald eagle, and osprey live along the Siticoos area by the Waxmyrtle Trail. The Eel Creek area includes many shore pines and provides shelter to the pine siskin, chestnut-backed chickadee, Swainson's thrush, wrentit, northern flicker, red crossbill, olive-sided flycatcher, and Anna's hummingbird. The white-tailed kite, northern harrier, violet-green swallow, downy woodpecker, orange-crowned warbler, yellow warbler, black-throated gray warbler, Townsend‚Äôs warbler, hermit warbler, great horned owl, and great egret have been sighted in the Horsefalls area. Western snowy plover Western snowy plover chicks The western snowy plover uses the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area as a nesting site. In 1993, it was identified as a \\"threatened\\" species by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, with only 68 birds remaining in Oregon. Multiple agencies used a multi-pronged approach to protect the plovers and increase their numbers. Techniques included restoring the plover habitat along the sand dunes by removing invasive beach grasses and maintaining the appropriate structures optimal for nest building. Protection of nesting sites is achieved by education, signage, and beach restrictions during the nesting season from March 15 through September 15. When necessary, these restrictions are enforced by police officers. Other techniques include removal of predators and accurate population monitoring. As of 2012, the number of plovers had increased to 403 birds. Oregon Dunes Restoration Collaborative The Oregon Dunes Restoration Collaborative is an organization that works with numerous government entities to preserve and restore the dunes. The group, formed in 2014, is engaged in efforts to combat the spread of invasive plant species that consume a large portion of the dunes. The invasive species seen today are a result of a twentieth-century effort by land managers to stabilize the dunes by planting grasses. While these grasses were successful in stabilizing the dunes, they have flourished to the point where they interfere with the natural shaping of dunes. Today the group, along with the United States Forest Service, is creating prioritization plans, locating funding sources, and raising public awareness of the project. The group encourages individuals to volunteer in engagement and stewardship initiatives around the dunes, employ sustainable recreation practices while visiting the dunes, and engage others about the current issues involving the dunes. Off- highway vehicle use The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area is among the top United States Forest Service sites in the country for off-highway vehicle (OHV) use. Until the first management plan was adopted in 1979, 91% of the site was available for the use of OHVs. A revised 1994 Recreation Use Plan restricted the use of OHVs to only 31% of the total site, split between two large units or Management Areas. As of 2018, visitors can use the North, Middle, and South OHV riding areas.United States Forest Service. Off Highway Vehicle (OHV).

Located at the intersection of 207th Street and Broadway in the Manhattan neighborhood of Inwood, near Inwood Hill Park, it is served by the A train at all times. History This underground station opened as Washington Heights‚Äì207th Street. The station opened on September 10, 1932, as the northern terminal of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND)'s initial segment, the Eighth Avenue Line between Chambers Street and 207th Street. This station was renovated in the late 1990s, and the contract for the project's design was awarded in May 1994.  Station layout  Entrance There is a single island platform between the two tracks, which are designated as Tracks A3 and A4, and end at bumper blocks just north of the platform at Chaining Station 1541+00. To the immediate south is an interlocking made up of a diamond crossover that allows trains to get to the correct track, and then proceed to share the right of way with the 207th Street Yard leads to Dyckman Street, which is the next station south. This station terminal has been refurbished with two ADA-accessible elevators added. The mezzanine and street elevator shaft includes artwork titled At the Start...At Long Last by Sheila Levrant de Bretteville. The terminal is operated by a Dispatcher's Office at the south end, while the Interlocking Plant is controlled by the CTC located in the 207th Street Yard. There used to be a mezzanine connecting the north and south exits of the station that closed. =Exits= * The main exit is three street stairs and an elevator at Broadway and 207th Street. The elevator is at the northwest corner while one stair leads from the other three corners. *The north exit is two street stairs to either northern corner of Broadway, Isham Street, and 211th Street. There is also a closed exit that led to the northwest corner of 207th Street and Broadway. This stair was located inside a building and had been closed after it was severely damaged after a fire. Several turns were required to access the staircase, creating poor sight- lines. In June 1994, the MTA Board approved a plan to permanently close the entrance, allowing the passageway to be sealed with brick-and-mortar at either end. At this point, the entrance had been closed for several years. It was estimated that the entrance would have been used by 400 daily passengers. A public meeting was held on May 1994, along with proposed station access changes at other stations. * * The elevator entrance is located near this old staircase.

A number of the species of Escherichia are pathogenic.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Bacteria. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds. Sidney Draggan and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC The genus is named after Theodor Escherich, the discoverer of Escherichia coli. Escherichia are facultative aerobes, with both aerobic and anaerobic growth, and an optimum temperature of 37 ¬∞C. Escherichia are usually motile by flagella, produce gas from fermentable carbohydrates, and do not decarboxylate lysine or hydrolyze arginine . Species include E. albertii, E. fergusonii, E. hermannii, E. senegalensis, E. marmotae and most notably, the model organism and clinically relevant E. coli. Shimwellia blattae was formerly classified in this genus. Pathogenesis While many Escherichia are commensal members of the gut microbiota, certain strains of some species, most notably the serotypes of E. coli, are human pathogens, and are the most common cause of urinary tract infections, significant sources of gastrointestinal disease, ranging from simple diarrhea to dysentery-like conditions, as well as a wide range of other pathogenic states classifiable in general as colonic escherichiosis. While E. coli is responsible for the vast majority of Escherichia-related pathogenesis, other members of the genus have also been implicated in human disease. Escherichia are associated with the imbalance of microbiota of the lower reproductive tract of women. These species are associated with inflammation.

He is recognized as one of the founders of American modernism, developing a \\"quasi-photographic\\" style of painting known as Precisionism and becoming one of the master photographers of the 20th century. Early life and career Charles Rettew Sheeler Jr. was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art from 1900 to 1903, and then the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied under William Merritt Chase. He found early success as a painter and exhibited at the Macbeth Gallery in 1908.Borland, Jennifer. Finding Aid to the Charles Sheeler Papers, circa 1840s-1966, bulk 1923-1965. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Most of his education was in drawing and other applied arts. He went to Italy with other students, where he was intrigued by the Italian painters of the Middle Ages, such as Giotto and Piero della Francesca. Later, he was inspired by works of Cubist artists like Picasso and Braque after a trip to Paris in 1909, when the popularity of the style was skyrocketing. Returning to the United States, he realized that he would not be able to make a living with Modernist painting. Instead, he took up commercial photography, focusing particularly on architectural subjects. He was a self- taught photographer, learning his trade on a five dollar Brownie. Early in his career, he was dramatically impacted by the death of his close friend Morton Livingston Schamberg in the influenza epidemic of 1918.Grace Glueck review of Morton Schamberg, NY Times, 1982 Retrieved August 11, 2010 Schamberg's painting had focused heavily on machinery and technology, a theme which would come to feature prominently in Sheeler's own work. Sheeler owned a farmhouse in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, about 39 miles outside Philadelphia, which he shared with Schamberg until the latter's death. He was so fond of the home's 19th century stove that he called it his \\"companion\\" and made it a subject of his photographs. The farmhouse itself serves a prominent role in many of his photographs, which include shots of the bedroom, kitchen, and stairway. At one point he was quoted as calling it his \\"cloister.\\" His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. On April 2, 1939, Sheeler (1883 ‚Äì 1965) married Musya Metas Sokolova (1908‚Äì1981) his second wife, six years after the death in 1933 of first wife Katharine Baird Shaffer (married April 7, 1921). In 1942 Sheeler joined the Met museum as a senior research fellow in photography, worked on a project in Connecticut with the photographer Edward Weston, and moved with Musya to Irvington-on- Hudson, some twenty miles north of New York. Sheeler worked for the Metropolitan Museum's Department of Publications from 1942 to 1945, photographing artworks and historical objects. Sheeler painted using a technique that complemented his photography and has been described as \\"quasi- photographic\\".[Styles, schools and movements, published by Thames & Hudson 2002 Amy Dempsey] He was a self-proclaimed Precisionist, a term that emphasized the linear precision he employed in his depictions. As in his photographic works, his subjects were generally material things such as machinery and structures. He was hired by the Ford Motor Co. to photograph and make paintings of their factories.

He was a divinity student at Yale and then minister of the First Congregational Church in Oswego. From 1828-1837 he was the minister of the Spring Street Presbyterian Church in New York City. That church, and Ludlow's home, were partially demolished in July 1834 in one of several nights of anti-abolitionist rioting prompted in part by rumors that Ludlow had presided over a mixed-race marriage.

It was recorded with a 21-piece orchestra and released in 1996. It has a slower and quieter sound than Sunny Day Real Estate's often-bombastic albums. The album was recorded after Enigk converted to Christianity; this conversion had been originally thought to have brought on the disbanding of Sunny Day Real Estate, which was later cleared up as a smaller part of more internal struggles in the band. Sunny Day Real Estate reunited in 1997, when they released How It Feels to Be Something On. The sound of that record furthers the mellower sound developed on Return of the Frog Queen. According to the 1997 Sub Pop mail-order catalog, Lou Barlow, of fellow Sub Pop band Sebadoh, cited Frog Queen as his favorite album of 1996.

These two constitute the banks of the river. A man-made lake in Keukenhof with grass banks In geography, a bank is the land alongside a body of water. Different structures are referred to as banks in different fields of geography, as follows. In limnology (the study of inland waters), a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the bed of a river, creek, or stream. The bank consists of the sides of the channel, between which the flow is confined. Stream banks are of particular interest in fluvial geography, which studies the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. Bankfull discharge is a discharge great enough to fill the channel and overtop the banks. The descriptive terms left bank and right bank refer to the perspective of an observer looking downstream, a well-known example of this being the sections of Paris as defined by the river Seine. The shoreline of ponds, swamps, estuaries, reservoirs, or lakes are also of interest in limnology and are sometimes referred to as banks. The grade of all these banks or shorelines can vary from vertical to a shallow slope. In freshwater ecology, banks are of interest as the location of riparian habitats. Riparian zones occur along upland and lowland river and stream beds. The ecology around and depending on a marsh, swamp, slough, or estuary, sometimes called a bank, is likewise studied in freshwater ecology. Banks are also of interest in navigation, where the term can refer either to a barrier island or a submerged plateau, such as an ocean bank. A barrier island is a long narrow island composed of sand and forming a barrier between an island lagoon or sound and the ocean. A submerged plateau is a relatively flat topped elevation of the sea floor at shallow depth ‚Äîgenerally less than ‚Äî typically on the continental shelf or near an island.

History Gilmore Field opened on May 2, 1939 and was the home of the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League until September 5, 1957. The stadium had a seating capacity of 12,987 people. It was there on September 23, 1948, that Ronald Reagan introduced President Harry S. Truman at a campaign rally, the first time that Reagan personally met a U.S President. =Location= The ballpark was located on the south side of Beverly Boulevard between Genesee Avenue and The Grove Drive, just east of where CBS Television City is currently located. A couple hundred meters to the west was Gilmore Stadium, an oval-shaped venue built several years earlier, which was used for football games and midget auto racing. To the east was the famous Pan-Pacific Auditorium. Both facilities were built by Earl Gilmore, son of Arthur F. Gilmore and president of A. F. Gilmore Oil, a California-based petroleum company which was developed after Arthur struck oil on the family property. The area was rich in petroleum, which was the source of the \\"tar\\" in the nearby La Brea Tar Pits. Later, the Gilmore Drive-In Theater was built, just south of the ballpark and east of the Farmers Market. =Field= The field had intimate quarters from the spectator standpoint ‚Äì first and third bases were 7.2 meters (24 feet) from the first row of seats. Home plate was 10.2 meters (34 feet) from the stands.The Sporting Life (Farmer's Market), Retrieved June 22, 2007 The outfield gave the pitchers more of a break with foul lines 101 meters (335 feet) long, power alleys about 116 meters (385 feet), and 123 meters (407 feet) to center field. (Ritter, p. 75) The power alleys were thus 12 meters (40 feet) deeper than in the cross-town counterpart, Wrigley Field. The diamond was situated in the northwest corner of the field. BaseballHollywood Stars= Hollywood Stars memorabilia In 1938 Herbert Fleishaker, owner of the Mission Reds moved his team to Los Angeles, and took the name of the Hollywood Stars after the city's previous PCL franchise. After but one season, the team was sold to new owners, among them Bob Cobb of Brown Derby Restaurant fame and the inventor of the California Cobb Salad. In their salad days, as it were, the Stars attracted glamorous actors and other celebrities or anyone else who wanted to be \\"seen\\", much as Dodger Stadium would later. One of the L.A. Angels players, Chuck Connors, made a successful move from one side of the box seat railing to the other, becoming the star in The Rifleman, a popular 1950's TV show. The Stars would play at Gilmore Field through the 1957 season. =Pittsburgh Pirates= In 1948, Gilmore Field became the spring training location for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Football The Hollywood Bears football team of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League played at the stadium in 1940‚Äì1942 and 1945. Movies Although L.A.'s Wrigley Field seemed to get the lion's share of Hollywood screen time, Gilmore Field also had its moments on celluloid. It was featured in a 1949 movie called The Stratton Story, starring James Stewart and June Allyson, the true story of a promising pitcher (Monty Stratton) whose career was curtailed due to a hunting accident that left him with an artificial leg. Stratton's major league baseball career was over, but he made a comeback at the minor league level. The scenes at the end of the movie were set elsewhere but were filmed at Gilmore Field. The layout of the outfield, and especially the exceptionally high left and right field corners, help to identify it. In The Atomic City (1952), Gilmore Field plays the site of a \\"Communist spy drop\\" during a game, with the still-new televising of the game providing the FBI agents with close-ups. Gilmore Field was also seen in the movie 711 Ocean Drive (1950). Half of the neon art deco \\"Hollywood Stars\\" sign, above the stadium entrance, is clearly visible. Demolished The ballpark site was abandoned after 1957. Gilmore Field was razed in 1958, beginning soon after an announcement in the Los Angeles Times of January 17. Much of the site is now occupied by a parking lot at CBS Television City, near the Farmers Market. In September 1997, the Pacific Coast League Historical Society, CBS, and the A.F. Gilmore Company dedicated a bronze plaque in commemoration of Gilmore Field on a wall outside CBS Studio 46. \\"The Ferris Wheel\\", one of the episodes of \\"Rescue 8\\", a syndicated United States television series broadcast in September 1958, was filmed at the demolition of Gilmore Field and includes many views of the stadium as it was being razed.

As a member and three term head of the council's Health and Welfare Committee, she worked to improve the health and education of the Navajo. Wauneka is widely known for her countless efforts to improve health in the Navajo Nation, focusing mostly on the eradication of tuberculosis within her nation. She also authored a dictionary, in which translated English medical terms into the Navajo language. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 by Lyndon B. Johnson as well as the Indian Council Fire Achievement Award and the Navajo Medal of Honor.Carolyn Niethammer, Keeping the Rope Straight, 2006, Salina Bookshelf, Inc., pages 82, 104 She also received an honorary doctorate in Humanities (public health) from the University of New Mexico.Neithammer, Page 98 In 2000, Wauneka was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.National Women's Hall of Fame, Annie Dodge Wauneka  Early life  Annie Dodge Wauneka was the daughter of the Navajo leader Henry Chee Dodge and his third partner Keehanabah or Mary Shirley Begaye of Deer Spring, Arizona. Keehanabah was forced to associate with Chee and unwillingly lived with him, often returning to her family in the Deer Spring area. It was during this time Annie was born, approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) south of current-day Sawmill, Arizona. Chee's first wife, Nanabah, raised Annie along with three other of Chee's children.Niethammer, p. 33. Having been raised by her father, a successful rancher, Annie lived a privileged life for a Navajo girl of her time. Annie visited with her mother Keehanabah, also a successful rancher, in later years until her mother's death in 1977. Annie also had a half-sister and five half brothers in Deer Spring, where their decedents still live today. Annie maintained her relationship with her mother and her half-sister and brothers throughout her life, often returning to the Deer Spring area. In 1918 at the age of 8, she was sent to a boarding school in Fort Defiance, Arizona where she spoke and read English. During that first year at school, the 1918 Spanish influenza epidemic struck the students and faculty. Annie recovered from a mild case of the flu and stayed at the school to help the school nurse care for the other student flu victims. This experience led to her later interest in public health. After that she was sent to an Indian school in Albuquerque, New Mexico where she completed grade eleven at the age of 19. She left school to marry George Wauneka, whom she had met in school.  Career  In 1951 she became the second woman to be elected to the Tribal Council, after Lilly Neil.Peter Iverson, Dine: A History of the Navajos, 2002, University of New Mexico Press, page 192Neithammer,Page 38Several references, including Harrison Lapahie Annie Dodge Wauneka , 1999, have made the mistaken claim that Annie was the first women to be elected to the Council She was immediately appointed head of the council's Health and Welfare Committee. She served in that committee for her 27 years in the council and served as its head for three terms. In 1953 her husband was running for the position that Wauneka had been holding, but she felt he was not a good candidate, so she ran against him and defeated him. In 1960 Wauneka began hosting a biweekly radio show on KGAK in Gallup, New Mexico. The program, completely in Navajo, covered topics of interest to the Navajo Nation, as well as health information.  Death  Wauneka died in a nursing home in Toyei, Arizona on November 10, 1997.

It was first published in the magazine Sur in February 1943. Plot The main character of the story is a playwright named Jaromir Hlad√≠k,The character's name (Jarom√≠r Hlad√≠k with Czech diacritics) was possibly inspired by the now forgotten Czech writer V√°clav Hlad√≠k (1868‚Äì1913). Balderston, Daniel: Out of Context. Historical References and the Representation of Reality in Borges, Durham ‚Äì London, Duke University Press, 1993, . (Spanish edition: Beatrix Viterbo Editora, 1996.) See also essay Borges y Praga (2000, in Spanish) by Franti≈°ek Vrhel (1943). who is living in Prague when it is occupied by the Nazis during World War II. Hlad√≠k is arrested and charged with being Jewish as well as opposing the Anschluss, and sentenced to die by firing squad. Although he at first experiences simple terror at the prospect of death, Hlad√≠k's main concern soon turns to his unfinished play, titled The Enemies. His previous works he feels to be unsatisfactory, and wants to complete this play, which he feels to be the one by which history will judge and vindicate him. With two acts left to write and his death sentence to be carried out in a matter of days, however, it seems impossible that he could complete it in time. On the last night before his death, Hlad√≠k prays to God, requesting that he be granted one year in which to finish the play. That night, he dreams of going to the Clementinum library, where one of the books contains God within a single letter on one of the pages, which the old, bitter librarian has been unable to find despite looking for most of his life. Someone returns an atlas to the library; Hlad√≠k touches a letter on a map of India and hears a voice that says to him, \\"The time for your labor has been granted\\". The next day at the appointed time, two soldiers come for Hlad√≠k, and he is taken outside and the firing squad is lined up before him. The sergeant calls out the order to fire, and time stops. The entire world freezes motionless, including Hlad√≠k himself, standing in place before the firing squad; however, although he is completely paralyzed, he remains conscious. After a time, he understands: God has granted him the time he requested. For him, a year of subjective time will pass between the sergeant's order and the soldiers firing their rifles, though no one else will realize that anything unusual has happened ‚Äì hence, the \\"secret miracle\\" of the story's title. Working from memory, Hlad√≠k mentally writes, expands and edits his play, shaping every detail and nuance to his satisfaction. Finally, after a year of labor, he completes it; only a single epithet is left to be written, which he chooses, and time begins again and the volley from the soldiers' rifles kills him.

It was founded in 1905 as the Nebraska State Normal School at Kearney. History In March 1903 the Nebraska State Legislature appropriated $50,000 to build a normal school in western Nebraska. In September of that same year, after 111 ballots, the State Board of Education accepted the city of Kearney's offer of and Green Terrace Hall at the western edge of the city to become its site. On October 18, 1904, the cornerstone of the first building was laid, while in the summer of 1905 the school offered its first classes in Kearney public facilities. The first classes on campus were held in the fall of 1905 as building was being completed. The first-year class consisted exclusively of women; Men's Hall was later established as the first hall for male students. The major sidewalks on campus were once roads, and the stoplight was located where the water fountain is now.UNK History In 1921 the institution's name changed to Nebraska State Teachers College. In 1963, it became Kearney State College. Both name changes were a part of system-wide changes for the state colleges. In 1989, a legislative act transferred the institution from the Nebraska State College System to the University of Nebraska system. After a Nebraska Supreme Court review, Kearney State College became the University of Nebraska at Kearney on July 1, 1991. Before its affiliation with the University of Nebraska, Kearney State had often been called \\"K State\\", an expression also often used for Kansas State University. State Representative Charles J. Warner of Waverly introduced the 1903 bill creating the institution; his son, State Senator Jerome Warner, introduced the bill making UNK a part of the University. Campus The UNK campus comprises 49 buildings on . Not all buildings are part of the contiguous campus, and many are used for non-academic purposes. =Residence halls= Antelope Hall Several nominators and the committee suggested that this name honors the Great Plains heritage, which has distinctively shaped the institution. It also aligns with the positive campus identity and tradition. Antelope Hall houses 160 students, in a mix of two- and four-person suites. Within the complex are computer labs, study rooms, TV lounges, full kitchens and centralized front desks. Nester Hall is named in honor of former UNK Chancellor William R. Nester who, as President of Kearney State College, led its transition into the University of Nebraska. The William R. Nester and Antelope Halls Complex consists of two housing units along 9th Avenue that are joined by a walk-through bridge way, that is also a lounge, study area and meeting room. Dr. Nester's name was suggested by many nominators and won wide support from those who commented and from the committee. Nester Hall opened in the fall of 2008. Centennial Towers West (CTW) and Centennial Towers East (CTE) were named in honor of the centennial of Nebraska statehood. Each building is seven stories tall, tying them for the tallest buildings in Kearney, and between them they house approximately 750 students. CTW underwent renovation during the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year and CTW was updated in 2013‚Äì2014. Jennie M. Conrad Hall no longer functions as a residence hall for students. The building is now home to the Office of Residence Life, the administrative office of campus housing and the Honors Program offices. Third floor of Conrad is supposedly haunted by a ghost. Lyle E. Mantor Hall houses approximately 320 students with a number of lounge areas, each equipped with pool tables, televisions, and computer facilities. Mantor Hall is home to the Thompson Learning Community. George E. Martin Hall no longer functions as a residence hall for students. Men's Hall was built as a WPA project in the late Depression, and its distinctive Art-Deco design has netted it a place on the National Register of Historic Places. At various times it has contained faculty offices, the campus library, and a cafeteria, but it has been returned to its original use as a residence hall. Despite the name, residence is co-educational. After renovations in 2010, the hall now houses only students in the Honors Program. Everett L. Randall Hall is adjacent to Mantor Hall and is conveniently located near the center of campus. Renovated in 2011, Randall has a ground level lounge with a game room, laundry facilities and computer lab H.G. Stout Hall was demolished in early 2011. University Heights is an off-campus apartment complex of one-bedroom and studio apartments. Often referred to as \\"U-Heights,\\" this facility comprises three buildings about a mile from campus. Space in University Heights is reserved for upperclass students, married students, non-traditional-aged students, and students with children. University Heights was closed in May 2017 and sold to Henning Brothers LLC for $800,004. The facility has been renovated and is currently a privately owned apartment complex. University Residence North and University Residence South, known respectively as \\"URN\\" and \\"URS,\\" are homes to the university fraternity and sorority chapters. These buildings house about 400 students between them and have on-site dining facilities. University Village Flats, apartment complex of one-bedroom and two bedroom apartments.

McElvaine (born January 24, 1947) is Elizabeth Chisholm Professor of Arts and Letters and Chair of the Department of History at Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi, where he has taught for thirty-five years. He is the author of seven books and the editor of three. He is considered one of the world's leading historians of the Great Depression. His first two books on the Depression era have become standards in the field. The Great Depression: America, 1929‚Äì1941, which came out in a new edition in 1993 and again in 2009, has been called \\"the best one-volume overview of the Great Depression.\\" Two of his books have been named among the \\"Notable Books of the Year\\" by the New York Times Book Review, and three have been listed among the Editor's Choice \\"Bear in Mind\\" books in that publication. McElvaine's articles and opinion pieces appear frequently in such publications as the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Times Book Review, Newsweek and The Nation. More than 100 of his articles have been published, some 60 of them in major national publications. He has been a guest on approximately 75 television and radio programs, including NBC's Today, ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, NBC Nightly News, National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning Edition, PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, BBC television and radio, and the Studs Terkel Show. McElvaine is a contributing blogger at The Huffington Post. Professor McElvaine has served as historical consultant for several television programs, including the seven- episode PBS series The Great Depression. He has received many awards for his teaching, including a silver medal in the national Professor of the Year program of the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education and being named Millsaps College's Distinguished Professor in 2001 and won the Carnegie Endowment Professor of the Year Award in Mississippi in 2002. McElvaine has read widely in fields including anthropology, human evolution, ancient history, and women's history, in order to offer a reinterpretation of the significance of sex in the unfolding of human history. For the past decade he has taught a course at Millsaps College titled \\"Sex, Religion, and Prehistory\\". He has lectured in the United States, Europe, Africa, and Australia on his ideas about the central influence on human history of various misconceptions and metaphors about sex that form the basis of Eve's Seed. That book has been favorably received by both general readers and academics.See editorial reviews on Amazon.com. His ideas were also featured in a feature article in the Arts & Ideas section of The New York Times. McElvaine's latest book, Grand Theft Jesus: The Hijacking of Religion in America (Crown, 2008) accuses the religious right of having \\"kidnapped Jesus\\". With reference to the presidency of George W. Bush, the Iraq War and the \\"prosperity gospel\\", and figures including Jerry Falwell, Ted Haggard, James Dobson and D. James Kennedy, McElvaine argues that the right has espoused a message that contradicts Jesus' teachings. In 2007, he wrote an extensive analysis of the economic conditions in comparison with those of the 1920s, \\"If (Economic) History Doesn't Repeat Itself, Does It Rhyme?\\" in which he predicted a coming collapse similar to what had happened in 1929.If (Economic) History Doesn't Repeat Itself, Does It Rhyme?. In 2009, Three Rivers (Crown) published a 25th anniversary edition of The Great Depression: America, 1929‚Äì1941 with a comprehensive new introduction comparing the economic collapse of 2008 with that of 1929.

The section can hold approximately 1,200 occupants. The section, also deemed \\"The Zoo\\" by Al McGuire for their humorous pranks, and \\"The Sixth-Man\\" by Duke men's basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski, is known for being \\"rude, crude and lewd ‚Äì as well as cleverly funny,\\" stated Frank Vehorn of the Virginian-Pilot. The Crazies are famous for painting their bodies blue and white or wearing outrageous outfits. They start their cheering as soon as warm-ups begin. Throughout the game, the Crazies jump up and down when the opposing team has possession of the ball and yell cheers in unison at focal points of the game. History The Cameron Crazies were named after Cameron Indoor Stadium, where the home basketball games are held, sometime in the mid-1980s. The name became widely known as Mike Krzyzewski's program. It became one of the best in the country. In an article about the Crazies published in 2007, Al Featherston stated, \\"Duke's crowd may or may not be the best student section‚Ä¶ but it is the standard by which all others are measured\\". Some other colleges and universities have used the Crazies as a model for their own cheering sections at basketball games, such as Harvard University and Indiana University, both of which recently printed a run of Crimson Crazies T-shirts. Over the years, some have noted that the Crazies have calmed down due to restrictions, such as not being able to throw things onto the court. Krzyzewskiville K-ville before the 2000 UNC‚ÄìDuke game Krzyzewskiville is a makeshift city in which the Cameron Crazies camp out before games in order to get seats. It was believed to be created in 1986 when around 15 drunk students rented a tent Thursday night and camped out for a game held on the following Saturday. Students followed the trend and eventually Krzyzewskiville became almost like an official town with its own metal placard. Before big games, like those against rival the University of North Carolina, more than 1,200 students pack the lawn. Living in tents in front of the stadium almost three months prior to the game, students have to use the restrooms in the gym, order pizzas and have them delivered to 'K-ville,' and follow strict rules enforced by the university. Strategies Since the 1980s, the Cameron Crazies have sent home humiliated opponents. The Crazies are organized and prepared for every game, handing out \\"dirt sheets\\" containing embarrassing information about opposing players, often focused around academic irresponsibility or run-ins with the law, as well as cheer ideas suggested by Duke's student team of line monitors. Once during a game, a television network had to turn off the sound because the Crazies were chanting about one of the sponsors. Other pranks including tossing bags of uncooked noodles during warmups at Georgia Tech's Craig Neal, who was 6'5\\" and weighed 160 pounds, throwing Twinkies at Georgia Tech's Dennis Scott because he was overweight, tossing pizza boxes as North Carolina State University's Lorenzo Charles walked on court after being caught stealing pizzas a few weeks prior to the game, and Chris Washburn had records thrown at him after being charged with stealing a stereo. After being criticized by The Washington Post, the Crazies changed the normal placard that read, \\"If you can't go to college, go to State,\\" and added \\"If you can't go to State, write for The Washington Post\\". Once, while losing to NC State, the Duke crowd started chanting, \\"That's alright, that's okay! You will work for us one day!\\". Cameron Crazies popularized many now-famous cheers and taunts, the most widely known of which is the \\"air ball\\" cheer in 1979 after North Carolina player Nick Yonakor's shot missed the rim and backboard entirely. Another famous instance of the Crazies' antics occurred in a Duke/UNC matchup on February 9, 2005. It was Roy Williams' first visit to Cameron Indoor as UNC head coach after formerly leaving his head coaching position at the University of Kansas. The Cameron Crazies used this knowledge and greeted the visiting Tar Heels in creative fashion. Some Duke fans dressed up as characters from The Wizard of Oz and prepared a yellow brick road for the Tar Heels to communicate that Williams was \\"not in Kansas anymore\\". One of their most famous chants occurs whenever an opposing player fouls out. As the player goes back to his bench, the Crazies mockingly wave at him and chant \\"Aaaaaah ...\\" When he sits down, they yell, \\"See ya!\\" Several players have been known to keep standing for long periods‚Äîas long as the remainder of the game‚Äîto keep from hearing \\"See ya!\\" Criticism In the past, the cheers and chanting have offended some coaches and fans, including Coach Krzyzewski, who in 1994 publicly asked the students to cheer for their team, not against the opposing team. Duke University President Terry Sanford agreed, sending the students an avuncular letter back in the 1980s asking them to change the obscene cheers into cheers that were \\"wholesome, witty, and forceful.\\" Television networks also took notice at one point; in 1979, NBC insisted on a time-delay so that the crowd could be censored if necessary. However, much of this criticism has cooled since the late 1990s, especially as commentators have noted that modern Duke teams frequently face far more vulgar abuse on the road than teams that visit Cameron due to their status as one of the few private schools with a consistently successful basketball program.

After graduating from UNL, he spent a year working in Washington, D.C. as legislative assistant to Congresswoman Virginia D. Smith, R-Neb, who represented Nebraska's 3rd congressional district from 1975 to 1991. Milliken earned a law degree in 1983 from New York University School of Law; he was a Root-Tilden Scholar and research assistant to Professor Norman Dorsen, then-president of the American Civil Liberties Union. After graduating from NYU Law, Milliken worked for the Legal Aid Society's Civil Division in New York City, then as an attorney at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. Career Milliken returned to Nebraska in 1988 where he accepted the position of executive assistant to the president of the University of Nebraska, and he was subsequently appointed Secretary to the Board of Regents and Vice President for External Affairs. In 1998, Milliken was appointed by then-president of the University of North Carolina, Molly Corbett Broad to lead university-wide strategy, institutional research, state and federal relations, public affairs, and economic development. In 2000, Milliken helped pass a statewide referendum for a $3.1 billion bond issue for university and community college facilities. Milliken was appointed president of the University of Nebraska in 2004. He worked to expand access and launched CollegeBound Nebraska, which provided free tuition to Nebraska Pell Grant recipients, University of Nebraska Online Worldwide, and Nebraska Innovation Campus, a public-private research and development park located on the former state fair grounds next to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus. He subsequently led a $1.8 billion capital campaign, funding new institutes for early childhood (Buffett Early Childhood Institute), global food and water sustainability (Daugherty Water for Food Institute) and rural sustainability (Rural Futures Institute). Milliken also helped lead the Nebraska P-16 Initiative to improve primary education and increase college preparation. He expanded the University's global reach, establishing new programs, with universities, the private sector and government, in China, India, Brazil and Turkey. Milliken became Chancellor of the City University of New York in 2014, and held the position through 2018. During his time as Chancellor, there has been federal and state investigations of institutional corruption at the university. In November 2016, an interim report of an investigation conducted by the office of New York State Inspector General found \\"financial waste and abuse\\", citing shoddy oversight and mismanagement that created a system ripe for financial waste and abuse, and criticized Milliken and CUNY General Counsel Frederick Schaffer, among others, for failing to \\"effectively operate\\" the university system. During the year preceding Milliken's resignation, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo replaced CUNY Board of Trustees chairmen Benno C. Schmidt Jr. with a new chairmen Bill Thompson, and nearly all of the members of CUNY's board of trustees with a new politically prominent bloc, about whom Milliken said, \\"will have their own ideas about CUNY, and they should have the opportunity to help shape the leadership and agenda for the future.\\" After state and federal investigation into financial irregularities in the CUNY system went public, top CUNY officials left their posts, beginning with the former president of the City College of New York Lisa Staiano-Coico; CUNY Vice Chancellor of Legal Affairs and General Counsel Frederick P. Frederick P. (\\"Rick\\") Schaffer; CUNY Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Operating Officer Allan H. Dobrin; CUNY Vice Chancellor for Research Gillian Small; and CUNY Senior Vice Chancellor of University Relations Jay Hershenson.http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20161204/POLITICS/161209957/cuny- shakeup-can-be-seen-as-an-effort-by-cuny-chancellor-james-milliken-to-keep- his-own-job Milliken is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Business Higher Education Forum, and on the executive committee of the Council on Competitiveness. He formerly served as a director on the board of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), and led the Commission on Innovation, Competition and Economic Prosperity. Personal life Since 1989, Milliken has been married to Nana Graves Hilliard Smith, a graduate of Yale University, and New York University School of Law. They have three children.

It was first introduced in 1995. An XRCD is priced about twice as high as a regular full-priced CD. JVC attributes this to the higher cost of quality mastering and manufacturing.  Technical overview  The XRCD definition refers to the mastering and manufacture process; the resulting CD and the contained data conform to the redbook standard and are encoded at 16 bits, 44.1 kHz. Hence, XRCDs are playable on any compact disc player. JVC uses advanced dither algorithms (though without noise shaping) in their K2 technology to transfer the analog or digital source to physical disc. The company claims to have studied how inferior CD-remastering techniques degrade the master tape sound and strives to minimize this loss.  Mastering process  If analog, the source material is first converted to digital via JVC's K2 20-bit or 24-bit analog-to-digital converter. The musical information is next encoded on a magneto-optical disk for transport to JVC's Yokohama manufacturing plant, where jitter reduction is applied. The musical signal on the disk is down-converted to 16-bit through a K2 \\"super-coding\\" process. This 16-bit signal is eight-to-fourteen modulation-encoded (EFM-encoded) before going through a proprietary \\"Extended Pit Cut\\" DVD K2 laser technology to produce a glass master. This optimizes the linear velocity of the glass master, giving precise pit lengths to eliminate time jitters, controlled by an extremely precise rubidium clock. All CDs are finally stamped directly from this glass master. XRCD2 and XRCD24 are improved versions of the original XRCD process. XRCD2 is the first to record to a magneto-optical disk via the digital K2 regenerator, while XRCD24 upgrades the original music signal's bit depth signal from 20 to 24 bits.

Currently, the region comprises five countries, from west to east: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.According to UN country classification. Western Sahara (formerly Spanish Sahara) is disputed mostly administered by Morocco. The Polisario Front claims the territory in militating for the establishment of an independent republic, and exercises limited control over rump border territories. The region has been influenced by many diverse cultures. The development of sea travel firmly brought the region into the Mediterranean world, especially during the classical period. In the 1st millennium AD, the Sahara became an equally important area for trade as camel caravans brought goods and people from the south. The region also has a small but crucial land link to the Middle East, and that area has also played a key role in the history of North Africa.  Prehistory The earliest known humans lived in North Africa around 260,000 BC. Through most of the Stone Age the climate in the region was very different from today, the Sahara being far more moist and savanna like. Home to herds of large mammals, this area could support a large hunter-gatherer population and the Aterian culture that developed was one of the most advanced paleolithic societies. In the Mesolithic period, Capsian culture dominated the eastern part of North Africa with Neolithic farmers becoming predominant by 6000 BC. Over this period, the Sahara region was steadily drying, creating a barrier between North Africa and the rest of Africa. Various populations of pastoralists have left paintings of abundant wildlife, domesticated animals, chariots, and a complex culture that dates back to at least 10,000 BCE in northern Niger and neighboring parts of Algeria and Libya. Several former northern Nigerian villages and archaeological sites date from the Green Sahara period of 7,500-7,000 to 3,500-3,000 BCE The Nile Valley on the eastern edge of North Africa is one of the richest agricultural areas in the world. The desiccation of the Sahara is believed to have increased the population density in the Nile Valley and large cities developed. Eventually Ancient Egypt unified in one of the world's first civilizations.  Classical period  The expanse of the Libyan Desert cut Egypt off from the rest of North Africa. Egyptian boats, while well suited to the Nile, were not usable in the open Mediterranean. Moreover, the Egyptian merchant had far more prosperous destinations on Crete, Cyprus and the Levant. Greeks from Europe and the Phoenicians from Asia also settled along the coast of Northern Africa. Both societies drew their prosperity from the sea and from ocean-born trade. They found only limited trading opportunities with the native inhabitants, and instead turned to colonization. The Greek trade was based mainly in the Aegean, Adriatic, Black, and Red Seas and they only established major cities in Cyrenaica, directly to the south of Greece. In 332 BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt and for the next three centuries it was ruled by the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty. The Phoenicians developed an even larger presence in North Africa with colonies from Tripoli to the Atlantic. One of the most important Phoenician cities was Carthage, which grew into one of the greatest powers in the region. At the height of its power, Carthage controlled the Western Mediterranean and most of North Africa outside of Egypt. However, Rome, Carthage's major rival to the north, defeated it in a series of wars known as the Punic Wars, resulting in Carthage's destruction in 146 BC and the annexation of its empire by the Romans. In 30 BC, Roman Emperor Octavian conquered Egypt, officially annexing it to the Empire and, for the first time, unifying the North African coast under a single ruler. The Carthaginian power had penetrated deep into the Sahara ensuring the quiescence of the nomadic tribes in the region. The Roman Empire was more confined to the coast, yet routinely expropriated Berber land for Roman farmers. They thus faced a constant threat from the south. A network of forts and walls were established on the southern frontier, eventually securing the region well enough for local garrisons to control it without broader Imperial support. When the Roman Empire began to collapse, North Africa was spared much of the disruption until the Vandal invasion of 429 AD. The Vandals ruled in North Africa until the territories were regained by Justinian of the Eastern Empire in the 6th century. Egypt was never invaded by the Vandals because there was a thousand- mile buffer of desert and because the Eastern Roman Empire was better defended.  Arrival of Islam  The Arab Conquest = The Mosque of Uqba also known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan was founded by the Arab conqueror Uqba Ibn Nafi al-Fihiri in 670 AD; it is the oldest and most important mosque in North Africa,Hans Kung, Tracing the Way : Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, page 248 city of Kairouan, Tunisia. The Arab invasion of the Maghrib began in 642 CE when Amr ibn al-As, the governor of Egypt, invaded Cyrenaica, advancing as far as Tripoli by 645 CE. Further expansion into North Africa waited another twenty years, due to the First Fitna. In 670 CE, Uqba ibn Nafi al-Fihiri invaded what is now Tunisia in an attempt to take the region from the Byzantine Empire, but was only partially successful. He founded the town of Kairouan but was replaced by Abul-Muhajir Dinar in 674 CE. Abul-Muhajir successfully advanced into what is now eastern Algeria incorporating the Berber confederation ruled by Kusaila into the Islamic sphere of influence.A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period, Cambridge University Press, 1987. In 681 CE Uqba was given command of the Arab forces again and advanced westward again in 682 CE, holding Kusaya as a hostage. He advanced to the Atlantic Ocean in the west and penetrated the Draa River Valley and the Sus region in what is now Morocco. However, Kusaila escaped during the campaign and attacked Uqba on his return and killed him near Biskra in what is now Algeria. After Uqba's death, the Arab armies retreated from Kairouan, which Kusaila took as his capital. He ruled there until he was defeated by an Arab army under Zuhair ibn Kays. Zuhair himself was killed in 688 CE while fighting against the Byzantine Empire which had reoccupied Cyrenaica while he was busy in Tunisia. In 693 CE, Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan sent an army of 40,000 men, commanded by Hasan ibn al-Nu'man, into Cyrenaica and Tripolitania to remove the Byzantine threat to the Umayyads advance in North Africa. They met no resistance until they reached Tunisia where they captured Carthage and defeated the Byzantines and Berbers around Bizerte. Soon afterwards, al-Nu'man's forces came into conflict with the indigenous Berbers of the JrƒÅwa tribe under the leadership of their queen, Al-Kahina. The Berbers defeated al-Nu'man in two engagements, the first on the river Nini and the second near Gabis, upon which al-Nu'man's forces retreated to Cyrenaica to wait for reinforcements. Reinforcements arrived in 697 CE and al-Nu'man advanced into what is now Tunisia, again meeting Al- Kahina near Gabis. This time he was successful and Al-Kahina retreated to Tubna where her forces were defeated and she was killed. al-Nu'man next recaptured Carthage from the Byzantines, who had retaken it when he retreated from Tunisia. He founded the city of Tunis nearby and used it as the base for the Ummayad navy in the Mediterranean Sea. The Byzantines were forced to abandon the Maghreb and retreat to the islands of the Mediterranean Sea. However, in 705 CE he was replaced by Musa bin Nusair, a prot√©g√© of then governor of Egypt, Abdul-Aziz ibn Marwan. Nusair attacked what is now Morocco, captured Tangier, and advanced to the Sus river and the Tafilalt oasis in a three-year campaign. = Kharijite Berber Rebellion  Rustamids  Banu Midrar  Aghlabids  Abbasids  Idrisids  Fatimids = The Muslim Berber dynasties  Zirids  Almoravids = In the 11th century, Berbers of the Sahara began a jihad to reform Islam in North Africa and remove any trace of cultural or religious pluralism. This movement created an empire encompassing parts of Spain and North Africa. At its greatest extent, it appears to have included southern and eastern Iberia and roughly all of present-day Morocco. This movement seems to have assisted the southern penetration of Africa, one that was continued by later groups. In addition, the Almoravids are traditionally believed to have attacked and brought about the destruction of the West African Ghana Empire.Lange, Dierk (1996). \\"The Almoravid expansion and the downfall of Ghana\\", Der Islam 73, pp. 122-159 Moorish Princes. However, this interpretation has been questioned. Conrad and Fisher (1982) argued that the notion of any Almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore, derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on Arabic sources while Dierke Lange agrees but argues that this doesn't preclude Almoravid political agitation, claiming that Ghana's demise owed much to the latter. = Almohads = The Almohads (or Almohadis) were similar to the Almoravids, in that they similarly attacked any alternative beliefs that they saw as corruptions of Islam. They managed to conquer southern Spain, and their North African empire extended further than that of the Almoravids, reaching to Egypt. = Marinids  Hafsids = The Hafsids were a Masmuda-Berber dynasty ruling Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia) from 1229 to 1574. Their territories were stretched from east of modern Algeria to west of modern Libya during their zenith. The dynasty was named after Muhammad bin Abu Hafs a Berber from the Masmuda tribe of Morocco. He was appointed governor of Ifriqiya (present day Tunisia) by Muhammad an- Nasir, Caliph of the Almohad empire between 1198‚Äì1213. The Banu Hafs, were a powerful group amongst the Almohads; their ancestor is Omar Abu Hafs al- Hentati, a member of the council of ten and a close companion of Ibn Tumart. His original name was \\"Fesga Oumzal\\", which later changed to \\"Abu Hafs Omar ibn Yahya al-Hentati\\" (also known as \\"Omar Inti\\") since it was a tradition of Ibn Tumart to rename his close companions once they had adhered to his religious teachings. The Hafsids as governors on behalf of the Almohads faced constant threats from Banu Ghaniya who were descendants of Almoravid princes which the Almohads had defeated and replaced as a ruling dynasty. Hafsids were Ifriqiya governors of Almohads until 1229, when they declared independence. After the split of the Hafsids from the Almohads under Abu Zakariya (1229‚Äì1249), Abu Zakariya organised the administration in Ifriqiya (the Roman province of Africa in modern Maghreb; today's Tunisia, eastern Algeria and western Libya) and built Tunis up as the economic and cultural centre of the empire. At the same time, many Muslims from Al-Andalus fleeing the Spanish Reconquista of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal were absorbed. He also conquered Tlemcen in 1242 and took Abdalwadids as his vassal. His successor Muhammad I al-Mustansir (1249‚Äì1277) took the title of Caliph. In the 14th century the empire underwent a temporary decline. Although the Hafsids succeeded for a time in subjugating the Kingdom of Tlemcen of the Abdalwadids, between 1347 and 1357 they were twice conquered by the Merinids of Morocco. The Abdalwadids however could not defeat the Bedouin; ultimately, the Hafsids were able to regain their empire. During the same period plague epidemics caused a considerable fall in population, further weakening the empire. Under the Hafsids, commerce with Christian Europe grew significantly, however piracy against Christian shipping grew as well, particularly during the rule of Abd al-Aziz II (1394‚Äì1434). The profits were used for a great building programme and to support art and culture. However, piracy also provoked retaliation from Aragon and Venice, which several times attacked Tunisian coastal cities. Under Utman (1435‚Äì1488) the Hafsids reached their zenith, as the caravan trade through the Sahara and with Egypt was developed, as well as sea trade with Venice and Aragon. The Bedouins and the cities of the empire became largely independent, leaving the Hafsids in control of only Tunis and Constantine. In the 16th century the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the Ottoman Empire-supported Corsairs. Ottomans conquered Tunis in 1534 and held one year. Due to Ottoman threat, Hafsids were vassal of Spain after 1535. Ottomans again conquered Tunis in 1569 and held it for 4 years. Don Juan of Austria recaptured it in 1573. The latter conquered Tunis in 1574 and the Hafsids accepted becoming a Spanish vassal state to offset the Ottoman threat. Muhammad IV, the last Caliph of the Hafsids was brought to Constantinople and was subsequently executed due to his collaboration with Spain and the desire of the Ottoman Sultan to take the title of Caliph as he now controlled Mecca and Medina. The Hafsid lineage survived the Ottoman massacre by a branch of the family being taken to the Canary Island of Tenerife by the Spanish. = Zayyanids  Wattasids = Ottoman rule  After the Middle Ages, Northern Africa was loosely under the control of the Ottoman Empire, except for the region of Morocco. Ottoman rule was centered on the cities of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.  European colonization  During the 18th and 19th century, North Africa was colonized by France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy. During the 1950s and 1960s, and into the 1970s, all of the North African states gained independence from their colonial European rulers, except for a few small Spanish colonies on the far northern tip of Morocco, and parts of the Sahara region, which went from Spanish to Moroccan rule. In modern times the Suez canal in Egypt (constructed in 1869) has caused a great deal of controversy. The Convention of Constantinople in 1888 declared the canal a neutral zone under the protection of the British, after British troops had moved in to protect it in 1882. Under the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, the United Kingdom insisted on retaining control over the canal. In 1951 Egypt repudiated the treaty, and by 1954 Great Britain had agreed to pull out. After the United Kingdom and the United States withdrew their pledge to support the construction of the Aswan Dam, President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal, which led Britain, France and Israel to invade in the week-long Suez War. As a result of damage and sunken ships, the canal was closed until April 1957, after it had been cleaned up with UN assistance. A United Nations force (UNEF) was established to maintain the neutrality of the canal and the Sinai Peninsula.

While most traditions discourage celibacy, all encourage strict chastity, modesty and privacy with regard to any relationships between genders, holding forth that their intimacy as perceived within Islamencompassing a swath of life broader than sexual activityis largely reserved for marriage. This sensitivity to gender difference, gender seclution and modesty outside of marriage can be seen in current prominent aspects of Islam, such as interpretations of Islamic dress and degrees of gender segregation. In Islam, prohibitions against extramarital sex are strong and permissible marital sexual activities are familiar subjects. Marriage and concubinage are permitted sexual relationships and they are described in Quran and Hadith as great wells of love and closeness. In these permitted relationships, there are also some limitations as well as permissions: a man should not have intercourse during his wife's menstruation and afterbirth periods. He is also considered to be sinning when penetrating anally. Contraceptive use like 'Azl is permitted for birth control. Actions and behaviours such as abortion after 4 months post conception (other than for medical risk to the pregnant woman) and homosexuality are strictly forbidden. Sex educationChildren= In Islam, parents are responsible for the upbringing of their children,Al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829) and that responsibility includes protecting them from anything that may corrupt their morals. Early sex education for children is not recommended by Islamic scholars, as the knowledge contained in such curriculum may be a negative influence on a young child's mind. According to Muhammad Al-Munajjid, young children should instead be taught Islamic rules involving covering the ‚Äòawrah, controlling one's gaze, and asking permission before entering private spaces. Munajjid also suggested to separate the bed of children at the age of ten according to hadith: Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-‚ÄòAzeemabaadi said: Munajjid stated, this advice and guidance from this verse has to do with protecting and concealing the ‚Äòawrah and avoiding provocation of desire which begins, as we have seen, in the tenth year, which is the age at which most children reach discernment. When puberty approaches, children should be taught the signs of puberty and the characteristics which distinguish men from women, and the types of discharge that may be emitted from the front passage of both sexes. They should also be taught the rulings on wudoo‚Äô and ghusl, paying attention to the phrases used in teaching and ensuring that it is taught according to what the child needs to know. Munajjid has maintained two as important matters which should begin at a very early age (contradiction of earlier saying about sex education) that have a basic connection to the issue of sex education. They are: # The necessity for the boy or girl to be able to distinguish between male and female. Confusion between them at that early age could lead to troubles and confusion in concepts, characteristics and actions, in both sexes. Hence it is essential to make a boy understand that he cannot wear his sister's clothes, or wear earrings or bracelets, because these are for females, not for males. By the same token, a girl should be told similar things about her brother's actions and characteristics. # Teaching children that the ‚Äòawrah is private, and that it should not be uncovered for anyone. Teaching them this, and bringing them up with it, is a way of instilling in them the characteristics of chastity and modesty, and will help prevent perverts from transgressing against them. Finally he stated, ‚ÄúWith regard to the issue of sex education having to do with intercourse, or what happens between spouses in general, this should come when there is a need for it, such as when marriage is approaching, or when he is mature enough to understand some issues of fiqh, such as the rulings on zina (fornication or adultery) and the like, which have to do with intercourse and ‚Äòawrahs. What is needed of that knowledge is basically something that is natural and instinctive in the first place, and what you need to point out must be taught to children gradually, in accordance with the stages of their development, by means of lessons of fiqh, study circles and classes in school. We should be conservative in the words and phrases we use, and attention must be paid to the appropriate ages and stages to discuss this topic. We must also warn against the promiscuous practices of the disbelievers and contrast them with the beauty of Islam, with regard to urging Muslims to cover up and be modest, and to guard their chastity and avoid that which is haraam.\\" =Adult= A mufti gives sexual advice in response to a woman's complaint about her son-in- law's inability to consummate his marriage to her daughter. Ottoman manuscript, 1721. Muslim men and women asked Islamic prophet Muhammad about issues concerning sexual behaviour, so as to know the teachings and rulings of their religion. Muslims could pose their questions either to Muhammad directly or to his wives. A hadith attributed to Muhammad's wife Aisha states that the Ansar women in particular were not shy about asking questions regarding sexual matters.Bukhari, Book 3, Number 0649 Circumcision Khitan or Khatna (, ) is the term for male circumcision carried out as a cultural rite by Muslims and is considered a sign of belonging to the wider Islamic community. Whether or not it should be carried out after converting to Islam is debated among Islamic scholars. The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as fitra (acts considered to be of a refined person). Abu Hurayra, a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a religious custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other hadiths which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of fitra and yet another hadith which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted, Hence, the different hadiths do not correspond on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not. According to some traditions Muhammad was born without a foreskin (aposthetic), while others maintain that his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib circumcised him when he was seven days old.Al-Halabi, Ali Ibn-Burhan-al-Din. Alsirah al-halabiyyah. Vol.1 Beirut: Al-maktabah al-islamiyyah. (n.d.): 54-5 Many of his early disciples were circumcised to symbolize their inclusion within the emerging Islamic community.source? Amongst Ulema (Muslim legal scholars), there are differing opinions about the compulsion of circumcision in Sharia (Islamic law). Imams Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa, founder of the Hanafi school of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and Malik ibn Anas, maintain that circumcision is a Sunnah Mu'akkadah‚Äînot obligatory but highly recommended. The Shafi\`i and Hanbali schools see it as binding on all Muslims. Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. It depends on family, region and country. A majority of Ulema however take the view that parents should get their child circumcised before the age of ten. The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of puberty.  Puberty  BƒÅligh or bul≈´gh () refers to a person who has reached maturity or puberty, and has full responsibility under Islamic law. For example, in issues pertaining to marriage, baligh is related to the Arabic legal expression, hatta tutiqa'l-rijal, which means that a wedding may not take place until the girl is physically fit to engage in sexual intercourse. In comparison, baligh or balaghat concerns the reaching of sexual maturity which becomes manifest by the menses. The age related to these two concepts can, but need not necessarily, coincide. Only after a separate condition called rushd, or intellectual maturity to handle one's own property, is reached can a girl receive her bridewealth.Masud, Islamic Legal Interpretation, Muftis and Their Fatwas, Harvard University Press, 1996 =Nocturnal emission= Nocturnal emission is not a sin in Islam. Moreover, whereas a person fasting (in Ramadan or otherwise) would normally be considered to have broken their fast by ejaculating on purpose (during either masturbation or intercourse), nocturnal emission is not such a cause. They are still required to bathe prior to undergoing some rituals in the religion. Muslim scholars consider ejaculation something that makes one temporarily ritually impure, a condition known as junub; meaning that a Muslim who has had an orgasm or ejaculated must have a ghusl, before they can read the Qur'an or perform the formal prayer known as salat. = Menstruation = Verse 2:222 in the Qur'an implies that sexual relations during menstruation are prohibited. However, unlike Jewish tradition, Islam does not forbid men from interacting with menstruating women entirely. Ibn Kathƒ´r, a muhaddith, narrated a hadith that describes Muhammad's habits with his menstruating wives. This hadith demonstrates that Muhammad gave licence to all forms of spousal intimacy during the period of menstruation with the exception of vaginal intercourse. Women are required to perform ritual cleansing (ghusl) before resuming religious duties or sexual relations upon completion of her menstruation. Conservatism Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of conservatism, decency and modesty; besides the lawful sexuality, priority is given to modesty and chastity both inside and outside the marital relationships. In the hadith literature, modesty has been described as \\"a part of faith.\\". Quran warns against fahisha or immoral lust. Some hadith warn against Fahisha (immodesty) including as follows, Modesty is maintained by gender segregation and seclution and it is verily required in the interaction between members of the marrigiable opposite sex called ghair-i mahram and in some case between the members of same sex and regardless of gender also. Dress-code is part of that overall teaching. In Quran, the subjects deal with modesty and privacy of men and women has been mostly described in An-Nur. For example, it has been mentioned, Hadith also describes the laws of modesty. Along with Quran it has also emphasized marriage as a requirement for modesty and chastity. For example, Islam has strictly descouraged nudity and public nakedness.It has been mentioned in Hadith ranging about men's and women's private parts that, Regarding men follows: Regarding women follows: > \\"Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Apostle of Allah > (peace_be_upon_him) wearing thin clothes. The Apostle of Allah > (peace_be_upon_him) turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma‚Äô, when a > woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she > displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face > and hands.\\" Abu Dawud > \\"After Muhammad issued the command (Quran 24:31) for women to cover > themselves, the women responded by tearing up sheets [or outer garments] to > cover their faces.\\" Sahih Bukhari (60:282) It is forbidden for both spouses to spread the secrets of what happens between them in their private marital life; indeed, this is one of the most evil things. Quran says, And also the Muhammad said: Privacy between unmarried man and woman is not allowed following: The following hadiths also commands maintaining basic privacy in societal gathering: In another hadith it has been mentioned, There is also prescription of modesty and privacy in case of unlawful sexual acts. It is mentioned in the hadith below from Muwatta Imam Malik: Legal sexualitiesSexual relationships= In Islam, there are two types of permitted sexual relationship: marriage and concubinage. They are also extended rulings regarding on the affairs. Marriage Marriage (Nikah) is a contract between Muslim men and his wife. Marriage has been described in tradition (hadith) as half of the religion with the regards of preserving chastity. In Islamic law, marriage legalizes sexual intercourse between the husband and wife. Marriage is not restricted to a platonic relationship nor is it only for procreation. Marriage is greatly encouraged in Islam, partially because it provides a lawful institution in which to fulfill one's sexual urges. Islam does provide extensive rules regarding sex; however, within the conditional institution of marriage, there are sources in both the Qur'an and hadith, which promote the well being of humans and their natural sexual instincts. In the Surah Baqarah, sex in married life is openly recommended: It has been also said: Additionally, sources of hadith illustrate similar promotion of fulfilling sexual urges in lawful ways within a marriage. The Wasaelush Shia quotes Muhammad as encouraging his followers to marry, saying: Muhammad also declared marital sex as charity: =Limitations= Marriage with an idolatress or idolater is forbidden (2:221). Muslim men can marry Muslim, Judaist, and Christian women, but can not marry any other religious or irreligious women, where Muslim women can marry only Muslim men. A Muslim man can maintain at-a-time four marital relationship, but Muslim women can at-a-time maintain only one marital relationship. Islam has forbidden marriage to one's father's wives (4:22), one's mother, daughters, sisters, father's sisters, mother's sisters, brother's daughters, sister's daughters, foster-mothers, foster-sisters, mother-in-law, stepdaughters born of women with whom one has had conjugal relations, the wives of blood-sons, and two sisters from the same family (unless it was unknown at the time that the two were related) (4:23), as well as all married women except who have become slaves as their previous marriage ends on becoming slave (3:24).  Concubinage  Islamic law does require a man to take consent from his slave girl in order to have sexual intercourse with her. In a hadith the prophet said if a man forces a slave girl then he has to set her free.https://sunnah.com/nasai/26/168 Concubinage is the only legal practice outside marriage in Islam, which is a sexual relation between a Muslim man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns. The term refers to the status of the female; Malik ibn Anas cites a report in which \\"Umar b. al- Khattab says that when a female slave gives birth to a child by her master, then the slave becomes an umm walad (mother of a child, concubine).\\" The Hanbali jurist Ibn Qudama explains that the father is not allowed to sell or transfer ownership of his concubine, though he is entitled to have sexual relations with her, to employ her service, to hire her out and to marry her. Ibn al-Humam adds that the slave-owner must acknowledge the kinship of the child. \\"Concubine\\" (surriyya) refers to the female slave (jƒÅriya), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse. The word \\"surriyya\\" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression \\"Ma malakat aymanukum\\" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines. Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practised under Islam through some reform with Jews and non- Muslim people. Muhammad also inspired to free \\"converted pious\\" concubines and marry them. Islamic jurisprudence sets limits on the master's right to sexual intercourse with his female slave. A man's ownership of his unmarried slave- girl gave him an exclusive right to have sex with her under the condition that he could not sell her to others (in order to prevent prostitution of slaves). A man could own a limitless number of concubines, but could not have access to the slave-girls owned by his wife. Marriage between the master and his concubine was only possible if she was granted free status first. To avoid pregnancies, the master had the right to practice coitus interruptus. The birth of progeny would change the legal status of the concubine to that of umm al-walad (\\"mother of the child\\"); as such, the concubine could not then be sold. On the (lawful) death of her master, she would automatically acquire free status and her children would be considered free and legitimate. Surah Al-Muminun (23:6) and Surah Al-Maarij (70:30) both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and \\"those whom one's right hands possess\\" (female slaves), saying \\" ÿ£Ÿéÿ≤ŸíŸàŸéÿßÿ¨ŸêŸáŸêŸÖŸí ÿ£ŸéŸàŸí ŸÖŸéÿß ŸÖŸéŸÑŸéŸÉŸéÿ™Ÿí ÿ£ŸéŸäŸíŸÖŸéÿßŸÜŸèŸáŸèŸÖŸí\\" (literally, \\"their spouses or what their right hands possess\\"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill, page 13. One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that \\"it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the Muslim community.\\" p.22 Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master p.48 (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, \\"in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests.\\" It is also considered a cultural taboo as a result according to which it was banned in numerous Islamic Empires and is out of favour in modern day Muslim countries. The practice has recently seen a revival among terrorist circles like the ISIS and Daesh. The history of slavery in Islamic states and of sexual relations with slaves, was the \\"responsibility of Muslims, and not of the Quran\\", according to Parwez, as quoted by Clarence-Smith. Amir Ali blamed the history of Islamic slavery in racist terms, states Clarence-Smith, stating that slave servitude and sexual abuse of captive slaves may have been because of degeneration of the Arabs from their admixing over time with \\"lower races such as Ethiopians\\". = Sexual techniques = One of the areas of Islamic sexual jurisprudence in which there are not many restrictions is the discussion of sexual techniques. Almost all of what is practised under Islamic law concerning sexual techniques and the act of sexual intercourse come from hadith, which are not restrictive in nature, but followed by a mutual etiquette known as foreplay, as the hadiths follow: The main tendency within these hadith are saying for Muslims to follow in the bedroom, saying which \\"clearly show that the husband and the wife should feel completely free when they are engaged in mutual stimulation which is known as foreplay. These sayings recommend foreplay, and only except anal intercourse, these hadiths put no direct restrictions on the type of techniques used during foreplay or during intercourse. Allah says in the Qur'an: In the foregoing verse the word harth (tilth) indicates that any kind of vaginal sex is permissible in Islam, but not anal sex, because vagina is the place from where children are produced; and it is also regardless any of sexual positions, because, the semen lodged in the womb from which offspring comes is likened to the seeds that are planted in the ground, bringing vegetation, and anyhow the seed is sown, it will bring out seedling; similarly vaginal intercourse regardless any position results in offspring generation. Although some claims that, top to bottom position has been encouraged most, but none of the vaginal sexual positions has been mentioned as prohibited in scripture and tradition.  Obligations  In Islam, the husband should have intercourse with his wife according to what satisfies her, so long as that does not harm him physically or keep him from earning a living. The husband is obliged to treat his wife in a kind and reasonable manner. Part of that kind and reasonable treatment is intercourse, which he has to do. The majority of scholars set the time limit beyond which it is not permissible for the husband to forego intercourse at four months, mentioning this tradition: But according to some scholars, the view is that there is no time limit.Ibn Qudaamah, Malik, Al-Mughni, 7/30, Al-Jassaas, Ahkaam al-Qur‚Äôaan, 1/374, Shaykh al-Islam, Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 246. Most of the scholars have said that, It is obligatory on women alike not to refuse their husbands if they call them, so long as the woman who is called is not menstruating or sick in such a way that intercourse will be harmful to her, or observing an obligatory fast. If she refuses with no excuse, then she is cursed.al-Fataawa al- Islamiyyah, 3/145, 146, Kashf al-Qinaa‚Äô, 5/189, Al-Muhalla, 10/40, Kashf al- Qinaa‚Äô, 5/189 But it is not permissible for a husband to force his wife to do more than she is able to bear of intercourse. If she has an excuse such as being sick or unable to bear it, then she is not sinning if she refuses to have intercourse.  Restrictions  All Muslim jurists agree that anal sex is haram (prohibited), based on the hadith of Muhammad: Further, it is reported that Muhammad referred to such an act as \\"minor sodomy\\". (Reported by Ahmad and An-Nasa'i) Sexual intercourse is prohibited: * during menstruation; verse 2:222 prohibits sexual relations with women during menstruation. Muhammad specifically restricts the injunction \\"to segregate the women\\" and \\"not go near them\\" in 2:222 to a prohibition against sexual relations with menstruating women. * for forty days after childbirth (puerperium); * during the daylight hours of the month of Ramadan (i.e. while fasting); * on pilgrimage; while in the sanctuary (in Ahram) at Mecca, pilgrims are not allowed to have intercourse. Marriages performed during the pilgrimage are invalid. =Procreation= In Islamic jurisprudence, the primary purpose of sex between marriage and concubinage is procreation. Islam recognizes the strong sexual urge and desire for reproduction. Dr. M.A. Rauf from his book 'Marriage in Islam'. In this excerpt, he discusses in great detail the advantages and possible disadvantages of marriage. Among the advantages that he discusses are procreation, fulfilment of the natural urge, companionship, comfort and relief to the soul, and so on. He also discusses the disadvantages and the types of burdens and risks involved with marriage. All of the advantages or benefits are in effect meant to be regarded as the secondary purpose of marriage which supplement its major aim or purpose, namely procreation. To beget children. This is the main purpose for marriage. The aim is to engender and preserve the human race. Four objectives are accomplished through procreation: - (i) to increase mankind (ii) Islam is propagated by increasing the number of followers of Muhammad (iii) parents will hope to leave behind children who will pray for them (iv) and According to Islamic belief, if a child dies before the parents, the prayers of the child in paradise will be very beneficial for the parents. The children born of the matrimonial union become legitimate and mutual rights of inheritance are established. Islam always supports a pro-natalist view of procreation, through many hadith. This hadeeth indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so Muhammad will feel proud of his followers before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children. In vitro fertilization Regarding the response to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) of Islam, the conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa include that: *IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilized egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician. *Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to zina, or adultery. = Purification and hygiene = Sexual hygiene in Islam is a prominent topic in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) due to its everyday nature. explains:Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Dur al-Mukhtar > When there is discharge of thick, cloudy white fluid (wady) (that exits > before or after urinating) or unlustful discharge of thin, sticky, white > fluid (madhy) caused by play or kissing, it requires ghusl. And wudu. Regarding things that necessitates ghusl: #sperm or female ejaculate that leaves its place of origin with desire [f: whether actual or effective], even if it exits the body without desire, even if without sexual intercourse; #the head of the penis entering either private part of a living human being who is fit for sexual intercourse, even without any release of sexual fluids...‚Äù [al- Hadiyya al-\`Ala‚Äôiyya (Gifts of Guidance, unpublished translation)] After partaking in sexual activity where penetration or ejaculation occurs, both men and women are required to complete a full-body ritual ablution known as ghusl in order to re-establish ritual purity before prayer. Ghusl requires clean, odourless water that has not been used for a previous ritual and begins with the declaration of the intention of purity and worship. A Muslim performing complete ablution then washes every part of his or her body. There are reports in the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad which indicate that the pubic hairs should be removed, he had set a time limit of 40 days, and the hair should not be left any longer than that and he set a time limit of no more than forty days for trimming the moustache, clipping the nails, plucking the armpit hairs and shaving the pubic hair. = Fasting and Ramadan = According to Qura'nic verse 2:187, one may have sex during the month of Ramadan but not during the time of fasting. As such, sex during Ramadan is only permitted at night. Although this passage is explicitly addressed to men, the regulations on sex in regard to fasting are universally taken to apply equally to both male and female Muslims.  Illegal sexualities  Islamic law establishes two categories of legal, sexual relationships: between husband and wife and between a man and his concubine. All other sexual relationships, according to Islamic laws made by exegesis of the Qur'an and the hadiths, are considered zinƒÅ (fornication). =Pornography= Pornography is considered haram and a clear sin. The Quran states: = Masturbation = According to majority jurists, masturbation is generally considered Haram or prohibited in Islam.The Lawful And The Prohibited In Islam, Yusuf Al-Qardawi - 1997The New Arab Man: Emergent Masculinities, Technologies, and Islam in the Middle East, p 168, Marcia C. Inhorn - 2012 But there are varying opinions among few jurists on the permissibility of masturbation. The Qur'an has been cited as being ambiguous on the issue of masturbation. The hadith regarding masturbation are, too, not considered to take a definitive stance on the subject. As such, positions on masturbation vary widely. According to alDin Tarbiyyah, it is permissible if done out of necessity.Islam, Gender, and Social Change - Page 28, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad, John L. Esposito - 1998 He also permitted masturbation as a means whereby soldiers, far away from their wives on a tour of duty may remain chaste. The four Sunni schools of jurisprudence (known as Madhaahib - the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali schools of Fiqh) have differing stances on the issue. Some see it forbidden in certain cases (i.e. if it leads a man/woman to ignore their spouse sexually) but recommended it when they see it as a lesser evil to illicit sex. It is generally prohibited according to the Hanafi and Hanbali Mazhabs, unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. According to Ahmed ibn Hanbal, it is permissible for prisoners, travellers and for men and women who have difficulty in finding a lawful spouse. It is prohibited all the time according to the Maliki and Shafi\`i Mazhabs.Marriage in Islam - Part 1 by Hussein Khalid Al-Hussein, Ph.D. Refer to: Section Al-\`Alaqat Al-Mubahah (Allowed Relationships) It is haram in Shi'ite jurisprudence. There has always been a view to permit masturbation as the lesser of two evils (so as to ward of falling into fornication). Thus it is categorically incorrect to state that all Islamic scholars of the early Islamic age have unanimously agreed upon its complete prohibition. Those few jurists who permits masturbation in different cases, they distinguish between those who masturbate out of necessity and those who have these means yet still masturbate to gratify their lust. =Oral sex= In Islam, oral sex between a husband and wife is considered \\"Makruh Tahrimi\\" or highly undesirable by some Islamic jurists when the act is defined as mouth and tongue coming in contact with the genitals. The reason behind considering this act as not recommended is manifold, the foremost being the issue of modesty, purification (Taharat) and cleanliness. The most common argument states that the mouth and tongue are used for recitation of the Qur'an and for the remembrance of Allah (Dhikr). Firstly, scholars considers touching genital by mouth as discouraged mentioning the reason that, touching genitals with the right hand rather than the left hand has been prohibited by Muhammad; as in their opinion, mouth is comparatively more honourable than the right hand, for that touching genitals with the mouth is more abhorrent and vacatably excluded. Secondly, the status of genital secretions is debated among the four Sunni schools, some scholars viewing them as impure and others not. = Fornication and adultery = Just as Islamic law fosters sexual actions within a marriage or lawful concubinage with wholly owned female slaves, there is also judicial opinion concerning sexual relations outside of these institutions. These laws, however, observe much stricter restrictions. Additionally, these laws have textual confirmation from the Qur'an. Verse 24:2-3 states that outside marriage and concubinage, Islamic law prohibits sexual relations as zina [fornication]. Verse 24:2-3 establishes that male and female fornicators are to be flogged one-hundred times. According to Hadith, married male and female fornicators are to be stoned to death. =Prostitution= Prostitution is banned in Islam. Quran states, Prostitution (trading sex for money) is haraam. If any does this then he shall be stoned to death. It was practised by some Arabs during the 6th century. In the 7th century, Muhammad declared that prostitution is forbidden on all grounds. Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: In Islam, prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with the saying: Narrated 'Urwa bin Az- Zubair: According to Shia Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned fixed-term marriage ‚Äì Nikah mut‚Äòah or sigheh, which is used as a legal alternative of prostitution in West Asian Shia population, where prostitution is forbidden. By contrast, in the Sahih al-Bukhari, Mut'ah marriage is classed as forbidden because Ali bin Abu Talib said that he heard Muhammad say that it is forbidden. As narrated by 'Ali bin Abu Talib: Zaidi Shia texts also state that Ali said Mut'ah marriage was forbidden and for this reason the Zaidi Shia do not practise Mut'ah marriage. = Rape = Rape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam, and can be defined in Islamic law as: \\"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\\". Rape is forbidden under Islamic law. It is defined as having extramarital intercourse by force or fear, including any subsequent injury both to the victim's mental and physical health. According to Islamic law, it is classified as hirabah, i.e. a violent crime causing disorder in the land in the manner described in the Qur'an as fasad (destructive mischief). A similar crime, for example, would be highway robbery, as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence. Some other branches of Islamic law consider it to be part of zina, as a crime called \\"forced fornication\\" (zina-bil-jabr). In Sharia, rape is punishable by stoning to death. Jami\` at-Tirmidhi, tirmidhi/17 17:37 , Under Islam, sexual intercourse is regarded as a loving act within marriage and should only be by mutual consent. There is, however, no explicit concept of rape within marriage in Sharia; a wife is deemed to have accepted conjugal relations as part of the marriage contract. She can only refuse on grounds which are specified as prohibited for sexual intercourse such as when she is fasting, menstruating, undergoing post-natal puerperal discharge, or whilst on Hajj or Umrah. Classical Islamic law defined what today is commonly called \\"rape\\" as a coercive form of fornication or adultery (zinƒÅ æ). This basic definition of rape as \\"coercive zinƒÅ æ\\" meant that all the normal legal principles that pertained to zinƒÅ æits definition, punishment and establishment through evidencewere also applicable to rape; the prototypical act of zinƒÅ æ was defined as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman over whom the man has neither a conjugal nor an ownership right. Sane adult male and female convicted of zinƒÅ æ were to receive a fixed corporal punishment (·∏•add): * One hundred lashes and exile for one year for unmarried free persons; * Stoning to death for married or previously married free persons; ZinƒÅ æ was established, according to classical law, through confession by one or both parties as well as proof. A second type of evidencepregnancy in an unmarried/unowned woman was contested between the schools. The stringent evidentiary and procedural standards for implementing the zinƒÅ æ punishment may have functioned to offset the severity of the punishment itself, an effect that seems to have been intended by legal authorities, who in the early period developed legal maxims encouraging averting the ·∏•add punishments as much as possible, whether through claiming ambiguity (shubhah) or a lack of legal capacity (ahliyya). What distinguished a prototypical act of zinƒÅ æ from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being \\"coercive\\" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of \\"coercion\\" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive zinƒÅ æ should receive the ·∏•add punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the ·∏•add punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual zinƒÅ æ due to their reduced capacity. According to the MƒÅlikƒ´, ·∏§anbalƒ´, and ShƒÅfi æƒ´ schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a \\"right of God\\" (·∏•aqq AllƒÅh), provoking the ·∏•add punishment; and a violation against a \\"human\\" (interpersonal) right (·∏•aqq ƒÅdamƒ´), requiring a monetary compensation. These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (bu·∏ç æ), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave. For them, in the same way that the slave owner was entitled to compensation for sexual misappropriation, the free woman was also entitled to compensation. The amount of this compensation, they reasoned, should be the amount that any man would normally pay for sexual access to the woman in question that is, the amount of her dower (·π£adƒÅq or mahr). As far as abortion in the context of rape, most jurist do not consider rape to be a valid reason: the sanctity of the new life takes precedence over the autonomy of the pregnant women. However, some womenin the middle east were arrested after they went to the police to report rapes. = Sodomy = Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a contemporary Sunni Muslim scholar, states that sodomy is prohibited.As the act is forbidden in the Islamic marriage contract, a wife must abstain from it should her husband demand it and may seek divorce if her husband persists or tries to force it on her. The act in itself, however, does not nullify the marriage and the wife must seek divorce if she is to leave her husband. Muslim scholars justify the prohibition on the basis of the Qur'anic verse 2:223, saying that it commands intercourse only in the vagina (i.e. potentially procreational intercourse). The vaginal intercourse may be in any manner the couple wishes, that is, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side. There are also several hadith which prohibit sodomy. From the story of Lot it is clear that the Qur'an regards sodomy as an egregious sin. The death by stoning for people of Sodom and Gomorrah is similar to the stoning punishment stipulated for illegal heterosexual sex. There is no punishment for a man who sodomizes a woman because it is not tied to procreation. However, other jurists insist that any act of lust in which the result is the injecting of semen into another person constitutes sexual intercourse. Sodomy often falls under that same category as sex between and unmarried man and women engaging in sexual acts. Male-male intercourse is referred to as liwat (literally, \\"joining\\") while female-female intercourse is referred to as sihaq (literally, \\"rubbing\\"). Both are considered reprehensible acts but there is no consensus on punishment for either. Some jurists define zinƒÅ æ exclusively as the act of unlawful vaginal penetration, hence categorizing and punishing anal penetration in different ways. Other jurists included both vaginal and anal penetration within the definition of zinƒÅ æ and hence extended the punishment of the one to the other. Religious discourse has mostly focused on sexual acts, which are unambiguously condemned. The Qur'an refers explicitly to male-male sexual relations only in the context of the story of Lot, but labels the Sodomites's actions (universally understood in the later tradition as anal intercourse) an \\"abomination\\" (female-female relations are not addressed). Reported pronouncements by Muhammad (hadith) reinforce the interdiction on male-male sodomy, although there are no reports of his ever adjudicating an actual case of such an offence; he is also quoted as condemning cross-gender behaviour for both sexes and banishing them from local places, but it is unclear to what extent this is to be understood as involving sexual relations. Several early caliphs, confronted with cases of sodomy between males, are said to have had both partners executed, by a variety of means. While taking such precedents into account, medieval jurists were unable to achieve a consensus on this issue; some legal schools prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment. There was general agreement, however, that other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offences, subject only to discretionary punishment. = Homosexuality = The Qur'an strictly prohibits homosexuality through the story of Lot (see verses 7:80-84, 26:165-166, 11:69-83, 29:28-35 of the Qur'an; which is also rendered in the Biblical Book of Genesis), in Al-Nisa, Al-Araf and possibly verses in other surahs.Camilla Adang (2003), Ibn Hazam on Homosexuality, Al Qantara, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 5-31Stephen O. Murray and Will Roscoe (1997), Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature, , New York University Press, pp. 88-94 For example, this was the verse addressed directly to Muhammad and his followers: In another verse, it has been also pointed out, The Hadiths consider homosexuality as zina, and male homosexuals to be punished with death. For example, Abu Dawud states,Mohamed S. El-Awa (1993), Punishment In Islamic Law, American Trust Publications, Al-Nuwayri (1272‚Äì1332) in his Nihaya reports that Muhammad is \\"alleged to have said what he feared most for his community were the practices of the people of Lot (he seems to have expressed the same idea in regard to wine and female seduction).\\" All major Islamic schools disapprove of homosexuality, See, for example, this website Islam views same-sex desires as an unnatural temptation; and, sexual relations are seen as a transgression of the natural role and aim of sexual activity.\\"Homosexuality in the Light of Islam\\" , 20 September 2003 Islamic teachings (in the hadith tradition) presume same-sex attraction, extol abstention and (in the Qur'an) condemn consummation. Most of the jurists believe there should be severe punishments according to the above Quranic and prophetic orders, such as death or floggings, while some others disagree. Early caliphs were known to have had both of the male partners executed in various ways. Some other jurists believe that there is no punishment that will serve as an effective purgative for this act, and therefore its immorality precludes an earthly punishment. Some jurists are so morally offended by homosexuality that just the discussion around it is cause for excommunication and anathematizing. The discourse on homosexuality in Islam is primarily concerned with activities between men. There are, however, a few hadith mentioning homosexual behaviour in women; the jurists are agreed that \\"there is no hadd punishment for lesbianism, because it is not zina. Rather a ta‚Äôzeer punishment must be imposed, because it is a sin..'\\". Although punishment for lesbianism is rarely mentioned in the histories, al-Tabari records an example of the casual execution of a pair of lesbian slavegirls in the harem of al-Hadi, in a collection of highly critical anecdotes pertaining to that Caliph's actions as ruler. Some jurists viewed sexual intercourse as possible only for an individual who possesses a phallus; hence those definitions of sexual intercourse that rely on the entry of as little of the corona of the phallus into a partner's orifice. Since women do not possess a phallus and cannot have intercourse with one another, they are, in this interpretation, physically incapable of committing zinƒÅ. =Incest= Hadith forbids incestous relationship (zinƒÅ bi'l-mahƒÅrim), marriage and therefore sexual intercourse between someone who is mahram (with whom marriage is forbidden), the Qur'an stipulates categories of women with whom men are prohibited from getting married and thus engaging in sexual intercourse. Verse 4:22-4 lists mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, wet nurses, wet nurses' daughters, wives' mothers, daughters of wives from different fathers, wives of sons, and women already married. Islam prescribes execution as punishment for such act. =Bestiality= According to hadith, bestiality is defined under zina and its punishment is execution of the accused man or woman along with the animal. Gender non-conforming people Mukhannathun (ŸÖÿÆŸÜÿ´ŸàŸÜ \\"effeminate ones\\", \\"men who resemble women\\", singular mukhannath) were men who acted in ways interpreted as feminine. As time went on, the mukhannathun were forced to be castrated. There has been significant mention of \\"mukhannathun\\" in ahadith and by scholars of Islam. The word refers to a person who behaves like a woman in gentleness, speech, appearance, movements and so on. The mukhannath or effeminate man is one who is male presenting, which may be unlike the khuntha (intersex). Effeminate people, in Islam, are considered of two types. (i)Those who are created that way (intersex); there is no sin on them. (ii)Those who were not created that way; rather they are believed to choose to imitate women in their movements and speech. This is the type which is cursed in the hadiths. The following tradition speaks to their behaviour: A sex change operation is prohibited by Islamic Law because it is considered to be altering God‚Äôs creation needlessly and in vanity, and some scholars claim it to be considered worse than homosexuality. God relates that Satan says: Muhammad also said regarding people \\"imitating\\" the opposite sex (which some believe references transgender people): Intersex An intersex person may have sex characteristics or organs that are not typically male or female. This person is called a Khunthaa in the books of Fiqh. There are three types of Khunthaa: 1\\\\. A person has aspects of both organs, and urinates from the male organ. This person will be included among the males and the laws regarding males will fall on him. 2\\\\. The person urinates from the female organ so will be included among the females. The laws related to females will fall on this person. This applies before the person reaches maturity. After maturity, the person will be rechecked. If he experiences wet dreams like a male then he will be counted as a male. On the other hand, if the person develops breasts and other signs of being feminine the she will be included among the females. 3\\\\. When both masculine and feminine signs are equal and it cannot be determined whether the person is more male or more female then such a person is termed Khunthaa Mushkil. There are different laws regarding such a person, a few examples: It is not permissible for a Khunthaa Mushkil to wear silk and jewellery. Both these are permissible for females. But because this person's condition cannot be ascertained, so precaution demands that such a person not wear silk and jewellery, because of the possibility that the person may be more male. Such a person cannot travel without a Mahram because of the possibility of being more female. When this person dies, Ghusl will not be given because the question arises that who will render the Ghusl, male or female. The law is that this person will be given Tayammum. If a Ghayr Mahram is rendering the Tayammum then the person has to wear a cloth over the hands. A Mahram does not have to wear a cloth over the hands. With regard to marriage of one who is intersex, if it is an unambiguous case, then according to how he or she is classified, he or she may marry someone of the opposite gender. If it is an ambiguous case, then the marriage of such a person cannot be valid, the reason being that he may be male, in which case how can he marry another male, or may be female, in which case she can't marry another female like her. If this individual is sexually attracted to females and claims to be a man, this is a sign that he is most likely male, and vice versa. Intersex medical interventions are considered permissible to achieve agreement between a person's exterior, chromosomal make-up or sex organs. They are regarded as treatment and not the altering of Allah's creation or imitation of the opposite sex.  Contraception  The Qur'an does not contain explicit text regarding contraception. Muslims refer to the hadith on the question of contraception. According to Muslim scholars, birth control is permitted, when it is temporary and for a valid reason. The companions of Muhammad are cited when addressing this issue. For example, Jabir, one of Muhammad's companions, relates a hadith in which a man came to Muhammad and said As such, the withdrawal method of contraception is allowed according to the hadith. Muslim jurists concur with its permissibility and use analogical deduction to approve other forms of contraception (e.g. condom usage). Supporting Sunnah include: =Sterilization= It is not permitted to carry out operations on men or women that will lead to complete sterility, such as cutting the vas deferens (vasectomy) in men, or removing the ovaries or womb (hysterectomy or ligation) in women. Irreversible methods of contraception and birth control called sterilization are not allowed for both male and female, except in the case of the wife who becomes terminally ill and perpetually incapable of having babies. Therefore, if the sterilization is irreversible and cannot be undone, it will not be permissible unless the woman is terminally ill. Under normal circumstances, sterilization is considered to be absolutely and decidedly prohibited in Shari‚Äôah. The irreversible nature associated with both the male and female sterilizations clearly contradicts one of the primary purposes of marriage which is to have children, as mentioned by Abu Hamid al-Ghazali in his Ihya‚Äô Ulum al-Din. Furthermore, sterilization is a form of mutilation of one's body (muthla), which has been clearly forbidden in the Shari‚Äôah. Allah Most High mentions in An-Nisa the words of Satan, when he said: However, in cases of absolute necessity, sterilization does become permitted. The well- known principle of Islamic jurisprudence based on the guidelines of the Qur‚Äôan and Hadith states: Being sterilized permanently may mean one of two things: # ‚Äì It may be done out of necessity, such as if it is determined by trustworthy medicinal evidence that pregnancy will pose a danger to the mother's life, and there is no hope of a cure, so permanent sterilization will ward off that danger. In this case it is permissible to be sterilized. # ‚Äì When there is no need for it. Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allaah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allaah bestows upon His creation. And it is not permissible to do anything that will put a stop to pregnancy.It says in al- Insaaf: It says in al-Faa‚Äôiq (1/383). The Islamic Fiqh Council stated the following: Based on this, if preventing pregnancy is for a legitimate reason as outlined above, then there is nothing to do anything. But if it was not for a necessary reason, then sterilizing is prohibited. =Castration= Castration is removal of the testicles. The Arabic word translated here as castration may also refer to removal of the testicles and penis. Some scholars differentiated between the two and said: If his testicles only are cut off, then he is a eunuch; if his penis is cut off, then he is emasculated. It is prohibited for a person to do that deliberately to himself or to someone else. Castration of the human is prohibited in Islam, whether he is a child or an adult, because of the prohibition on hadith on that. Ibn Hajar said: Among the reports that confirm this prohibition is the following prophet Muhammad's era, when some followers wanted to be castrated in abstance of their wives, but the prophet forbade it and permitted three days temporary marriage for them for a certain period, but after the period he declared it permanently forbidden: Ibn Hajar said, commenting on these hadiths: The reason behind the prohibition on castration is that it is contrary to what the Lawgiver wants of increasing reproduction to ensure continuation of struggle against the disbelievers. Otherwise, if permission had been given for that, then many people would have done that, and reproduction would have ceased, and the numbers of Muslims would have become less as a result, and the numbers of non-Muslims would have increased, and that is contrary to the religious purpose.  Abortion  Islamic schools of law have differing opinions on abortion, though it is prohibited or discouraged by most. However, abortion is allowed under certain circumstances, such as if the mother's health is [seriously] threatened. If the abortion is necessary to save the woman's life, Muslims universally agree that her life takes precedence over the life of the fetus. Muslim jurists allow abortion in this context based on the principle that what is considered the greater evilthe woman's deathshould be warded off by accepting the lesser evil of abortion. In these cases, the physician is considered a better judge than the scholar. Abortions of pregnancies that are merely unplanned or unwanted are generally haram (forbidden). The Qur'an forbids the abortion of a fetus for fear of poverty: Muslim views on abortion are also shaped by the Hadith as well as by the opinions of legal and religious scholars and commentators. In Islam, the fetus is believed to become a living soul after four months of gestation,\\"(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to write four things...then the soul is breathed into him\\" and abortion after that point is generally viewed as impermissible. Many Islamic thinkers recognize exceptions to this rule for certain circumstances; indeed, Azizah Y. al-Hibri notes that \\"the majority of Muslim scholars permit abortion, although they differ on the stage of fetal development beyond which it becomes prohibited.\\" Most Muslim scholars hold that the child of rape is a legitimate human being and therefore subject to the same laws of abortion (i.e. its abortion is permitted only if the fetus is less than four months old, or if it endangers the life of its mother). Some scholars disagree with this position. Some Muslim scholars also argue that abortion is permitted if the newborn might be sick in some way that would make its care exceptionally difficult for the parents (e.g. deformities, mental retardation, etc.).

Campaigns In recent years, the association has focused on a number of campaigns, most relating to employment rights of serving officers. =Tasers= Since 2010, the association has campaigned for the roll-out of non-lethal electroshock weapons (specifically Tasers) to NSW Police officers.

The association responded by saying the number of assaults against officers had \\"plummeted\\" since the introduction of Tasers.NSW Ombudsman calls for Taser overhaul by Vincent Morello (Sydney Morning Herald, 23 October 2012) =Death and disability payments= In 2011, the NSW Government made reforms to the NSW Police Death and Disability scheme to \\"[remove] the giant lump sum payments and [encourage] more officers to return to work\\". The association organised a number of protests against the changes but eventually ceded to the governments demands. In early 2012, the Government negotiated further changes to the scheme to allow for payments of up to AUD$900,000 to a short list of unresolved cases that had not been finalised. These were the last Police Officers to receive lump sum payments as a result of being medically unfit for duty. The NSW Opposition (specifically former Premier Nathan Rees) claimed the outcome was a, \\"backdoor deal done with the association which undermines the whole arrangement\\".NSW police officers paid almost $1 million each to quit force under deal struck with O'Farrell government by Barclay Crawford (The Sunday Telegraph, 12 February 2012) As a result of these reforms medically unfit Officers are now discharged from service and receive five years of recurring payments at 75% of their salary. Once the five years elapses, if the officer is still unable to obtain alternate employment, they are required to apply to centrelink for disability payments if they still wish to receive an income.

He is known for his large format architecture and landscape colour photographs, often using a high point of view in most of his photos. His works reach some of the highest prices in the art market among living photographers. His photograph Rhein II was sold for $4,338,500 on 8 November 2011. Gursky shares a studio with Laurenz Berges, Thomas Ruff and Axel H√ºtte on the Hansaallee, in D√ºsseldorf. The building, a former electricity station, was transformed into an artists studio and living quarters, in 2001, by architects Herzog & de Meuron, of Tate Modern fame. In 2010‚Äì11, the architects worked again on the building, designing a gallery in the basement.  Education  Gursky was born in Leipzig, East Germany in 1955. His family relocated to West Germany, moving to Essen and then D√ºsseldorf by the end of 1957. From 1978 to 1981, he attended the Universit√§t Gesamthochschule Essen, where he studied visual communication, led by photographers Otto Steinert and Michael Schmidt. Gursky is said to have attended the university to hear Otto Steinert, however Steinert died in 1978 and Gursky only got to attend a few of his lectures. Between 1981 and 1987 at the D√ºsseldorf Art Academy, Gursky received critical training and influence from his teachers Hilla and Bernd Becher,Tomkins, Calvin. The New Yorker. \\"The Big Picture.\\" 22 January 2001. a photographic team known for their distinctive, dispassionate method of systematically cataloging industrial machinery and architecture.Marien, Mary Warner. Photography. 2006, pp. 371-72 Gursky demonstrates a similarly methodical approach in his own larger-scale photography. Other notable influences are the British landscape photographer John Davies, whose highly detailed high vantage point images had a strong effect on the street level photographs Gursky was then making, and to a lesser degree the American photographer Joel Sternfeld.  Career and style  Before the 1990s, Gursky did not digitally manipulate his images.Warren, Lynne. Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography. 2006, page 644 In the years since, Gursky has been frank about his reliance on computers to edit and enhance his pictures, creating an art of spaces larger than the subjects photographed. Writing in The New Yorker magazine, the critic Peter Schjeldahl called these pictures \\"vast,\\" \\"splashy,\\" \\"entertaining,\\" and \\"literally unbelievable.\\"Schjeldahl, Peter. The New Yorker. \\"Reality Clicks.\\" 27 May 2002. In the same publication, critic Calvin Tomkins described Gursky as one of the \\"two masters\\" of the \\"D√ºsseldorf\\" school. In 2001, Tomkins described the experience of confronting one of Gursky's large works: The perspective in many of Gursky's photographs is drawn from an elevated vantage point. This position enables the viewer to encounter scenes, encompassing both centre and periphery, which are ordinarily beyond reach.Andreas Gursky: New work, 23 March‚Äî5 May 2007 White Cube, London, UK. This sweeping perspective has been linked to an engagement with globalization. Visually, Gursky is drawn to large, anonymous, man-made spaces‚Äîhigh-rise facades at night, office lobbies, stock exchanges, the interiors of big box retailers (See his print 99 Cent II Diptychon). In a 2001 retrospective, New York's Museum of Modern Art described the artist's work, \\"a sophisticated art of unembellished observation. It is thanks to the artfulness of Gursky's fictions that we recognize his world as our own.\\"Museum of Modern Art. \\"Andreas Gursky.\\" Exhibition Catalog, 2001 Gursky's style is enigmatic and deadpan. There is little to no explanation or manipulation on the works. His photography is straightforward. Gursky's Dance Valley festival photograph, taken near Amsterdam in 1995, depicts attendees facing a DJ stand in a large arena, beneath strobe lighting effects. The pouring smoke resembles a human hand, holding the crowd in stasis. After completing the print, Gursky explained the only music he now listens to is the anonymous, beat-heavy style known as Trance, as its symmetry and simplicity echoes his own work‚Äîwhile playing towards a deeper, more visceral emotion. The photograph 99 Cent (1999) was taken at a 99 Cents Only store on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and depicts its interior as a stretched horizontal composition of parallel shelves, intersected by vertical white columns, in which the abundance of \\"neatly labeled packets are transformed into fields of colour, generated by endless arrays of identical products, reflecting off the shiny ceiling\\" (Wyatt Mason).Andreas Gursky, 99 Cent, 2001 UBS Art Collection, Z√ºrich. Retrieved 15 March 2016. Rhein II (1999), depicts a stretch of the river Rhine outside D√ºsseldorf, immediately legible as a view of a straight stretch of water, but also as an abstract configuration of horizontal bands of colour of varying widths.The Andreas Gursky: Rhine II (1999) Tate Collection. In his six-part series Ocean I-VI (2009‚Äì2010), Gursky used high-definition satellite photographs which he augmented from various picture sources on the Internet.Andreas Gursky, 1 May-21 June 2010, Spr√ºth Magers, Berlin.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . More than 150 different syndromes have been identified. Despite some of the syndromes having different genetic causes, the symptoms are sometimes very similar. Diagnosis is usually by clinical observation, often with the assistance of family medical histories so that it can be determined whether transmission is autosomal dominant or recessive. Worldwide, around 7,000 people have been diagnosed with an ectodermal dysplasia condition. Some ED conditions are only present in single family units and derive from very recent mutations. Ectodermal dysplasias can occur in any race but are much more prevalent in Caucasians than any other group and especially in fair Caucasians. Ectodermal dysplasias are described as \\"heritable conditions in which there are abnormalities of two or more ectodermal structures such as the hair, teeth, nails, sweat glands, salivary glands, cranial-facial structure, digits and other parts of the body.\\"  Presentation  Hair = Individuals affected by an ED syndrome frequently have abnormalities of the hair follicles. Scalp and body hair may be thin, sparse, and very light in color, even though beard growth in affected males may be normal. The hair may grow very slowly or sporadically and it may be excessively fragile, curly, or even twisted. Kinky hair is also a possibility. = Nails = Fingernails and toenails may be thick, abnormally shaped, discolored, ridged, slow-growing, or brittle. The cuticles may be prone to infections. = Skin = The skin may be lightly pigmented. Skin sustaining injury may grow back permanently hypo-pigmented. In some cases, red or brown pigmentation may be present. Skin can be prone to rashes or infections and can be thick over the palms and soles. Care must be taken to prevent cracking, bleeding, and infection. = Sweat glands = Individuals affected by certain ED syndromes cannot perspire. Their sweat glands may function abnormally or may not have developed at all because of inactive proteins in the sweat glands. Without normal sweat production, the body cannot regulate temperature properly. Therefore, overheating is a common problem, especially during hot weather. Access to cool environments is important. thumbright350pxDental abnormalities in a 5-year-old girl from north Sweden family who suffered from various symptoms of autosomal dominant hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED): a) Intraoral view. Note that the upper incisors have been restored with composite material to disguise their original conical shape. b) Orthopantomogram showing absence of ten primary and eleven permanent teeth in the jaws of the same individual. =Salivary glands= Several studies have examined salivary flow rate in individuals and found parotid and submandibular salivary flow ranging from 5 to 15 times lower than average. This is consistent with the salivary glands being of ectodermal origin, although some findings have suggested that there is also mesodermal input.Singh, P.; Warnakulasuriya, S. Aplasia of submandibular salivary glands associated with ectodermal dysplasia. J Oral Pathol Med. 2004 Nov;33(10):634-6.Nordgarden, H.; Storhaug, K.; Lyngstadaas, S. P.; Jensen, J. L. Salivary gland function in persons with ectodermal dysplasias. Eur J Oral Sci. 2003 Oct;111(5):371-6. = Teeth = The development of tooth buds frequently results in congenitally absent teeth (in many cases a lack of a permanent set) and/or in the growth of teeth that are peg-shaped or pointed. The enamel may also be defective. Cosmetic dental treatment is almost always necessary and children may need dentures as early as two years of age. Multiple denture replacements are often needed as the child grows, and dental implants may be an option in adolescence, once the jaw is fully grown. Nowadays the option of extracting the teeth and substituting them with dental implants is quite common. In other cases, teeth can be crowned. Orthodontic treatment also may be necessary. Because dental treatment is complex, a multi-disciplinary approach is best. = Other features = People with ED often have certain cranial-facial features which can be distinctive: frontal bossing is common, longer or more pronounced chins are frequent, broader noses are also very common. In some types of ED, abnormal development of parts of the eye can result in dryness of the eye, cataracts, and vision defects. Professional eye care can help minimize the effects of ED on vision. Similarly, abnormalities in the development of the ear may cause hearing problems. Respiratory infections can be more common because the normal protective secretions of the mouth and nose are not present. Precautions must be taken to limit infections.FAQs / General Description  Genetics  ED can be classified by inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked) or by which structures are involved (hair, teeth, nails and/or sweat glands). There are several different types with distinct genetic causes: * Hay‚ÄìWells syndrome (Rapp‚ÄìHodgkin syndrome) and EEC syndrome are all associated with TP63. * Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia can be associated with EDA, EDAR and EDARADD. * Margarita Island ectodermal dysplasia is associated with PVRL1. * Ectodermal dysplasia with skin fragility is associated with PKP1. * Clouston's hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is associated with GJB6. * Naegeli syndrome/Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticulariss is associated with KRT14. * Pachyonychia congenita is caused by multiple keratins. * Focal dermal hypoplasia is associated with PORCN. * Ellis‚Äìvan Creveld syndrome is associated with EVC. * Palmoplantar ectodermal dysplasia refers to several different conditions selectively affecting the hands and feet.  Notable cases  * Michael Berryman, American actor with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia * Levi Hawken, New Zealand skateboarder and artist who became well known in 2011 in New Zealand for the \\"Nek minnit\\" viral video on YouTube *Melanie Gaydos, American fashion model *Jovante Carter, a.k.a HolyGxd, a viral social media content creator.

PhD thesis, University of Wisconsin‚ÄîMadison:1987 pg 105 n.97 Biography Naropa was a contemporary of Ati≈õa. Naropa was born in a high status Brahmin family of Bengal. From an early age showed an independent streak, hoping to follow a career of study and meditation. Succumbing to his parents' wishes, he agreed to an arranged marriage with a young Brahmin girl. After 8 years they both agreed to dissolve their marriage and become ordained. At the age of 28 Naropa entered the famous Buddhist University at Nalanda where he studied both Sutra and Tantra. He gained the reputation of a great scholar and faultless debater, essential at that time as the tradition of debate was such that the loser automatically became a student of the winner. He eventually gained the title \\"Guardian of the Northern gate\\", engaged in many debates and taught and won many students. According to his Tibetan namtar, or spiritual biography, one day, while he was studying, a dakini appeared to Naropa and asked if he understood the words of the Dharma, Buddha's teachings. He replied that he did and when she seemed happy with his response, he added that he also understood their meaning. At this point the dakini burst into tears, stating that he was a great scholar, but also a liar, as the only one who understood the teachings was her brother, Tilopa. On hearing the name \\"Tilopa\\", he experienced an intense feeling of devotion, and Naropa realised he needed to find the teacher to achieve full realisation. He abandoned his studies and position at the university and set out to find Tilopa. Naropa then underwent what is known as the twelve minor hardships in his quest to find his teacher, all the hardships being hidden teachings on his path to enlightenment. When he finally met Tilopa, he was given the four complete transmission lineages which he then began to practice. While studying and meditating with Tilopa, Naropa had to undergo a further twelve major hardships, trainings to overcome all the obstacles on his path, culminating in his full realisation of mahƒÅmudrƒÅ. Naropa spent a total of twelve years with Tilopa. At the bank of river bagmati, in the premise of Hindu shrine Pashupatinath Temple , there is the cave where he was initiated by Tilopa and attained Siddhi. Later in his life Naropa stayed in Phullahari, where he died aged 85. Phullahari or Pullahari was located most likely in eastern Bihar or Bengal.Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism. Columbia University Press, 2003. . One of the few reliable historical accounts of him comes from a Tibetan translator named Ngatso Lotsawa, who made an effort to visit Naropa at the monastery of Phullahari while waiting to visit with Ati≈õa at Vikramashila. Thangka of Mahasiddha Naropa, 19th century Legacy Naropa is remembered for his trust and devotion to his teacher, which, according to his biography, enabled him to attain enlightenment in one lifetime. He is also remembered as part of the \\"Golden Garland\\", meaning he is a lineage holder of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism and was considered an accomplished scholar. A great practitioner, Naropa is best known for having collated the Six Dharmas. These practices help achieve Buddhahood more rapidly. Many subsequent Karmapas have been particularly adept at one or more of these practices, which in Vajrayana tradition are held to have been given by the Buddha and were passed on through an unbroken lineage via Tilopa to Naropa, Marpa and Milarepa and on to the present day. Naropa is considered one of the eighty-four mahasiddhas, the 'saints' of Vajrayana. Naropa University in Colorado, USA was named in his honour.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of 'myna', and is shared with other members of the genus Manorina.For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna Retrieved 12 September 2013 The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain psyllid bugs that feed on eucalyptus sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment. Bell miners live in large, complex, social groups. Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding. The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them. The birds defend their colony area communally and aggressively, excluding most other passerine species. They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed. Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom. The heritage listed mountain village of Bellbrook NSW was named after the distinctive sound of local bellbirds in 1882. Taxonomy The bell miner (Manorina melanophrys) belongs to the family of honeyeaters and Australian chats (Meliphagidae), which is part of the superfamily Meliphagoidea that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills (Acanthizidae); bristlebirds (Dasyornithidae); fairy-wrens (Maluridae); and pardalotes (Pardalotidae). Bell miners share the genus Manorina with three other endemic Australian miners: the noisy miner (M. melanocephala), the yellow-throated miner (M. flavigula), and the endangered black-eared miner (M. melanotis). The generic name Manorina is derived from the Ancient Greek manos 'thin' and rhinos 'nostrils'. The three other miners were previously classified in the genus Myzantha, which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to Manorina has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain Melidectes honeyeaters. The bell miner's tinkling bell-like call was noted by early European explorers, and the name bellbird was considered established 30 years later, when David Collins mentioned \\"the melancholy cry of the bellbird.\\" In 1802, John Latham named the bird Turdus melanophrys meaning 'black-browed thrush'. While Latham's scientific name became accepted, John Gould continued to use Australian bellbird as the name for the species in 1848. The common name of bellbird may lead to some confusion with the Australian inland endemic crested bellbird, which is a member of the family Oreoicidae. The two species exhibit very different calls, behaviour, and do not overlap in range. Description Bell miners are the smallest of their genus, and differ from the other three predominantly grey miner species in having olive-green plumage, darker on the wings and yellower on the belly. They are a medium bodied honeyeater, slightly smaller and stockier than a Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii), weighing between 25g and 35g (average 29g). Bell miners are 17.5‚Äì20 cm in length (average 18.5 cm) with a 22‚Äì30 cm wingspan (average 26.5 cm). They have the characteristic yellow bill of the miners, which is slightly downturned. The legs are bright orange, and the bare patch behind the eye is red-orange. The crown and lores are black, while the feathers in front of the eye are yellow. A dark streak runs from the corner of the bill downward giving a slight frowning appearance. Eyes are brown and mouth is yellow. Both sexes look alike, though the males tend to be slightly larger. It is possible to determine the sex of the birds by analyzing wing length, tail length, and culmen depth, or by observing calls that are unique to females, but there is no easy way to reliably determine the sex in the field without careful observation of behaviour and calls. Juveniles are more brown-colored than the adults and overall less bright in color. Young birds do not have the bare skin patch behind the eye. The patch initially develops as pale grey, then transforms to pale yellow, and darkens to pale orange before taking on the adult bright red-orange color as the bird matures. Nestlings are born naked and develop light brown down about two days post hatching. The birds are heard more than they are seen, as bell miners tend to forage high in the canopy, and their olive-green plumage blends into the surrounding leaves. However, they keep up their \\"ping\\" contact call as they forage throughout the day. In the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, bell miners come low enough to be easily seen and photographed. Distribution and habitat Bell miners are distributed from around Gympie in Queensland, south along the coastal plain and ranges, to Victoria, around Melbourne. They prefer the margins of wet or dry sclerophyll forest and thick woodlands, often with a stream or other permanent water source nearby. This limits their range to higher rainfall areas near the coast, often bordering, but not inside, rainforest. Compared to the closely related noisy miner, bell miners prefer a denser habitat with a thick understory (<5 m), but a sparse midstory (5‚Äì15 m) and canopy (>15m). In an undisturbed setting, bell miners choose habitat with an understory of shrubs, ferns, sedges, and rainforest vines. They have been observed to expand their range in disturbed habitats that have a thick undergrowth of the invasive weed lantana. Bell miner population densities have been measured at 14-38 birds per hectare. They are particular about their preferred habitat and reasonably small disturbances to undergrowth, such as fire or lantana removal, can cause a colony to move to a new territory. BehaviourSocial organization= The complex social organization of bell miners was observed as early as the 1960s in New South Wales, and has been studied by several research groups in Victoria. Bell miners live in large colonies of 8-200+ birds, which consist of coteries or clans of generally related male birds and their offspring. Each coterie is made up of several monogamous breeding pairs with their nest helpers. As a colony, bell miners are aggressive and set up a permanent territory that they will defend together against all other honeyeaters and any other species, which they perceive are a threat to their preferred food source or themselves. Within the colonial territory, each breeding pair has its own foraging range. Helpers assist multiple breeding pairs, and move between the foraging range of several pairs. Coteries are groups that are interconnected and interact daily within the larger colony, due to a close genetic relationship. Due to their aggressive nature, bell miners are known for excluding other birds from their territory, and larger avian species, like kookaburras, currawongs, and crows are mobbed by up to twelve miners from different coteries within the colony. Predators are repeatedly attacked, if they settle in another part of the colony's territory. Small birds that keep to the understory, like fairy-wrens, scrubwrens and blackbirds are often not driven out, but small birds that typically forage in the midstory or canopy or share similar foods, like pardalotes, are not allowed access within the territory. One of the few species that can sometimes displace bell miners is the similarly aggressive noisy miner, but in general noisy miners prefer areas with little understory. Bell miners are able to suppress the numbers of competing species in territory that they hold for years. However, bell miner colonies have clearly defined territorial boundaries, and beyond those boundaries the local bird assemblage resumes its normal diversity. =Feeding= Bell miners specialize in consuming insects known as psyllids and their associated young nymphs, sweet lerps, and other psyllid secretions. Psyllid products may consist of up to 90% of the bell miner's diet. Bell miners forage primarily among leaves, branches, and loose bark in the canopy, generally at least 8 m in height, but they do descend to the dense understory. There is a theory that bell miners 'farm' psyllids by excluding other psyllid-eating bird species from a large enough territory, that the miners themselves do not require all the psyllids from in order to sustain the colony. One hypothesis under the farming theory is that the bell miners may selectively eat only older nymphs, or may often eat the lerps and leave the nymph unharmed. Evidence for this theory has been mixed. An early study of stomach contents did not find supporting evidence for this theory, as bell miner stomachs did not contain the higher lerp/nymph ratio that would have been expected. However, a later behavioral comparison between bell miners and noisy miners did observe that bell miners carefully used their tongue to remove lerps, which left the nymph intact. In contrast, noisy miners pried the lerp and nymph off with their beak and consumed both. When bell miners are removed, psyllid colonies are generally quickly decimated by the other forest bird species that move into the miners' former territory. Although psyllids are the primary food source, like most honeyeaters, bell miners have also been recorded drinking nectar from eucalyptus, banksia, and mistletoe flowers, as well as eating various other insects, including spiders, beetles, weevils, moths, and wasps. Bell Miner Associated Dieback Bell miners are so closely associated with eucalyptus dieback that the phenomenon has been named Bell Miner Associated Dieback (BMAD). Concern about BMAD has led to the formation of the BMAD Working Group, the 2004 BMAD Strategy, the 2005 BMAD National Forum, the 2006 BMAD Literature Review, and continues to be an area of active research. Eucalyptus dieback involved complicated ecosystems with numerous variables and occurs in some habitats without the presence of bell miners, but there is a high correlation with bell miner presence and eucalyptus dieback that was noted as early as 1982. One theory is that the monopolising and/or farming of psyllids by bell miners allows psyllid numbers to build up, eventually leading to tree sickness and possibly death. In some cases where bell miners have been removed, the avian diversity has been restored and the psyllid infestation reduced to the point of trees returning to health. However, in other studies, the trees did not recover even after bell miner removal, so more research is needed to better understand the relationship between bell miners and eucalyptus dieback. =Breeding= immature birds Bell miners are generally sedentary, and thus have a permanent all-purpose territory, which includes breeding. The primary breeding season is April/May to August/September in the northern part of their range and June/July to November/December in the southern range, but breeding has been observed in all months of the year, as females will often nest again after a failed nest or once the young have fledged. One female was recorded nesting five times in one season, though that many nest attempts is unusual. Bell miner pairs are monogamous, but the breeding tasks are divided between the sexes. Female bell miners build the nest over 8 days, incubate the 1-3 (but typically 2) eggs for 14.5 days, and brood the young for up to 12 days, depending on the weather. The nests are small, cup-shaped, and built with dry twigs, grasses, and bark woven together with spider web. Nests are generally hidden in the foliage of dense understory plants, 3-5m above the ground. The eggs are typically 24mm x 16mm, oval shaped, and pink in color. They have darker reddish-brown spots and blotches, primarily over the larger end. Pallid cuckoos have been recorded as nest parasites for bell miners. While nests are all within the territory of the colony, they are not tightly packed as traditional colony breeders. Instead, nests are located within the breeding pairs' normal foraging range. They are generally within calling range of neighbour nests, but not too close. Female bell miners move nest locations after a nest failure, and were observed to move nests lower into the thick understory, likely reducing the risk of avian predators. However, they did not move nests far from the original location horizontally, possibly to stay within their home foraging range, and to retain their established set of helpers. Females will also alter brood sex ratios to meet conditions. When a colony is in a new location with an inferior food source, the ratio will be biased towards more females, which will disperse from the colony at sexual maturity. Once the food supply has been increased, the brood sex ratio is shifted towards future helping males. Nest helpers Both parents and helpers provision and care for the nestlings. Nests may be attended by up to 20 helpers, and nest success has been observed to be higher when there are at least 6 additional helpers attending the nest, in addition to the breeding pair. Helpers feed the young, defend the nest against predators, remove droppings, and remove parasites. Nest helpers include both sexes, but are predominately young and breeding age males. Juvenile birds start helping as early as 1.3 months old. Older non-breeding males contribute the most food to nestlings and assist with multiple nests. The amount of help offered by a nest helper is correlated with its genetic relationship with the nestlings it is feeding. Bell miners use a provisioning call when they arrive at the nest to stimulate the young to beg. Provisioning calls are similar among closely related miners, so helpers preferentially help young with fathers that have provisioning calls similar to their own. However, it is important to note that even non-related helpers have been shown to contribute a significant amount to raising young, and no difference was seen in the amount of help offered by helpers, depending on the brood sex, even though male chicks tend to stay with the colony and become helpers, while females disperse. Helpers will delay bringing food to the nestlings when the female is brooding them, but will eventually bring food, even if the female continues to brood. The brooding female is more likely to allow the young to be fed if the attendant is her mate. Fledgling to adulthood Young bell miners leave the nest about 12 days post hatching, but continue to be fed by parents and helpers for a further 10 weeks. Bell miners will start helping at nests when less than 2 months old, but the transition is gradual, such that recently fledged birds will continue to beg from other helpers, and then either consume the offered food or give it to younger birds. Females tend to disperse from the colony at 8 months, and they reach breeding age at 8.3 months. It is likely that the mothers become intolerant of their daughters, as they reach maturity, prompting their dispersal. The mortality of bell miners prior to breeding age is very high at 93%. The greatest risk is soon after young bell miners leave the nest, when many are preyed upon. Known predators include grey currawong, Australian raven, laughing kookaburra, brown goshawk, copperhead snake, and eastern brown snake. By the time they reach breeding age, the sex ratio is skewed with more surviving males, probably due to higher mortality of the dispersing females.

The webcomic started April 1, 1997. On April 3, 2006, after nine years drawing the strip, Rosenberg became a full-time cartoonist making his living drawing Goats. In 2010, because of work on Scenes from a Multiverse, Goats was put on hiatus. In 2012 Rosenberg raised more than $55.000 via Kickstarter to print Goats Book IV, relaunch the website and finish the story with Goats Book V. In August 19, 2014, 71 comics and all e-books were republished, while Kickstarter backers have yet to receive any merchandise. Goats follows a (loose) plot surrounding the adventures of Rosenberg's cartoon alter ego, along with his friend/drinking buddy Phillip, and many characters including animals, celebrities, aliens and villains. Most of the strips are separated into story arcs, which have very different, though still coherent, plots. Except for the time that the world was destroyed, all of the strips fit into one continuous timeline. The strip originally took place entirely in Manhattan, New York, and mostly within either Jon and Phillip's apartment or their favorite bar (the Peculier Pub, mirroring a genuine Manhattan pub). After several years, the strip has expanded significantly in plot expansion, character development and scene location. Diversification began after what Rosenberg has referred to as \\"the soft reset\\" of the Goats multiverse when the Earth was destroyed. Goats and Rosenberg are part of the Dumbrella collective. Goats was hosted by Phillip Karlsson's Dumbrella Hosting service. LocationsManhattan 3= Manhattan 3 is very similar to our universe in many regards (save for the existence of Satanic chickens, extraterrestrials and talking animals). The Earth was destroyed once, but no-one batted an eyelid. It is unclear as to whether that happened in Manhattan 3 or a very similar and much less complicated universe. Currently, due to the disappearance of Gus and Steve (the editor monkeys for Manhattan 3), the level has gone stagnant, causing the inhabitants to lapse into a sleepy state indistinguishable from death. The Peculier Pub Bleecker Street The inspiration for the Peculier Pub is a pub with the same name that is located in Manhattan on Bleecker St. between LaGuardia Pl. and Thompson St. It is a museum of the brewing arts that simultaneously explains the evolution of the aluminum can and serves host to numerous students during busy weekend hours. The Peculier Pub of Manhattan 3 has been host to zombie invasions, alien sexual maturing, amorous goats, fish who live in beer, plane crashes, philosophical drunken debates and numerous other events. New Jersey New Jersey of the Goats multiverse is usually an ancillary location only seen in b-stories and recollection. It is generally south of Manhattan 3 but reference to Jersey 17 have shown that there are alternate New Jerseys that may or may not have any similarities to what we know. Many characters have links to New Jersey in Goats. Diablo's mother was impregnated by the demonic soul of Ray Cohn in 1986 outside of Plainsboro. According to one of Diablo's Twix sagas, he later married Shazam Twix and they settled in a cottage in New Jersey and had five children. It also stands as the home of Stan, Diablo's poker partner, the Demon Fire of Xibalba and the location of the cave-home of Shazam Twix as he is looking for love while in a sanitarium. The initial target in Gregor Mendel's world takeover plan, New Jersey is often the butt of jokes for its questionable quality of life and has been even been equated to Brussels, the \\"New Jersey of Europe.\\" Allegedly, the New Jersey Turnpike connects the lower consulting levels of Xibalba to Manhattan 3's New Jersey without the need for teleportation or knacking. Later plans for New Jersey have been touched on during Toothgnip's psychic ramblings where he states that in 2032, the ruins of New Jersey are ruled over by Jerrell. Doodletown Though an actual tourist location in New York, in the mind of Diablo, the site is an \\"Auschwitz for chickens\\" and home to anti- chickeners. It is also the site of the Chicken-Bear Massacre of 1869. =Pub Stub= Levels of existence exist along dimensional axis in the Goats multiverse. Along the axis in each dimension of existence is a pub that acts as the hub of the dimension. At least one dimension is somewhat different; this dimension is one that \\"died in the womb\\" and whose only locale is the pub on the axis. The only permanent resident in this \\"pub stub\\" is Alfred, a self- proclaimed \\"bartender to God\\" who has remained in the Pub after having been inexplicably transported there 19,000 subjective years (some twenty years in Earth Dimension time; time within the pub stub is not synced with other levels) from his homeland in Switzerland. No objects within the pub have any color and visitors become grey if in the Pub Stub for a suitable amount of time. =Topeka Prime= A farm universe, with a communist like culture and fear based leadership. They were among the first levels to discover the nature of the universe and attempt to reverse engineer the universal source code, which was compiled in their holy text, the Great Farmer's Almanac. The Topekans are a determinist society who live according to the Almanac's prediction. They have taken it upon themselves to find the Programmer, who is described in the Almanac as the one who can pierce the skin between worlds, in order to reach the Infinite Monkey Dimension, repair the multiverse's calendar function, and ensure their place in the Reboot. They are also heavily imperialistic, subjugating other levels with value-priced food. They are opposed by the Middle Pangaeans. =Infinite Monkey Dimension= As its name implies, the Infinite Monkey Dimension (also known as \\"Alternate Dimension\\") houses an infinite number of monkeys. They were employed by God (before his death), and work as editors of other dimensions. They work partially because they wish to make the other dimensions better places, and partially for the weekly pudding parties on the dimension. Important Infinite Monkeys in this realm include Steve and Gus, who may or may not have created Oliver as an attempt to make the \\"story\\" of the dimension more interesting. Also residing in the Dimension is Woody Allen, the Editor-In-Chief. The dimension is geographically similar to Arkansas (as seen in numerous strip backgrounds). It has rolling hills and mountains in the distance and a very heavy wooded aspect interlaced with streams and waterfalls. At least four planetary bodies are visible in the skies. The Infinite Monkey Dimension differs from the other levels in that there is no axis pub, eliminating the prospect of travel to and from the dimension via Knack. =Middle Pangaea= Angry and Downer loners inhabit this realm only to unite in need of reproduction or of tasks that take more than one Middle Pangean. They used to be a happy bunch until a universe was destroyed by Topeka Prime and the worms that fed on happiness invaded their realm. Only the depressed and loneliest survived leading to today's angry militant culture. =Xibalba= Xibalba is the source of the Demon Fire used to complete Oliver's dimension-jumping spider robot, Tarfon. It was first referenced by Stan, who gave the direction as being \\"one exit south of here on the New Jersey Turnpike.\\" The route is separated by three trials until the traveller must vanquish the gods of death. Skullburger is also located here and is frequented by familiar characters Ernesto's clone and One Death. =Crab City= Crab City is a City made by Crabs, for Crabs and from Crabs. The Crabs are very proud of this. CharactersMain characters= ; Jon : Technically the level-headed one, Jon is possessed of a wry sense of humor and seemingly limitless patience. In the beginning, many of the strips relied on mocking his pathetic life, but eventually he got the girl and became a respectable character. He always wears a thin black tie and drinks IPAs. You could sort of call him the main character, but the strip has effortlessly managed to ignore him for months at a time. Recently, he has usurped control of Xibalba Consulting. ; Phillip : Jon's drinking buddy, a programmer, Swedish, and very fond of Hefeweizen. Phillip views the world through the bottom of a glass that is permanently full of beer, and seems to be completely incapable of pursuing a logical train of thought, or even a coherent one. Nevertheless, this approach seems to pay off, as Phillip is a multi- millionaire, having invented \\"Sporkle\\" brand pork and apple drink, and the colour Blern. He has also successfully overclocked a lemon, enjoys the life of a petty supervillain in the guise of the Chaos Pope, and is a member of the International League of Pedants. Phillip is known as \\"The Programmer\\" in many prophecies, and he is to save the universe from ending on December 12, 2012. ; Toothgnip : The Goat of the title, although actually something of a minor player of late. Was one of Thor's chariot-pulling goats, and his name was created during a drunken conversation about Norse mythology. Until recently, he possessed the Panties of Potency, which gave him the power to pick up women in bars. He currently appears to have some other powers, granted by the Demon Fire of Xibalba, but the extent of these is still unclear, suffice to say they include advanced telepathic powers. ; Diablo : Originally, a satanic chicken, introduced long ago to spice up the comic. Generally causes outrageous violence and mischief, but is still cute. Has been decapitated and dismembered a number of times (and, on one occasion, actually buried). Longtime poker buddies with Stan, whom he mistakenly calls Satan, who makes convincingly good hummus dip. ; Fish/Fineas : Once a simple goldfish who lived in a mug of beer, \\"Fish\\" has evolved dramatically during the series. His other personality, Fineas, is a hyperintelligent immortal cyborg assassin created when Gregor Mendel kidnapped Fish and implanted a USB 1.1 port on the back of his neck, connecting directly to his brain. The Fineas personality emerged on and off, eventually being subjugated into Fish's Twin Peaks-style inner mind. Recently, the internal personification of Fineas was able to use the GNUniverse 1.3 to export himself to the same level as the other characters. ; Neil and Bob : Two immature, irresponsible, violent, lovable, and self-described omnisexual aliens. They have a spaceship which is powered by an engine which when you put kittens in pop-tarts come out. For some time, the kittens were thought to become poptarts, but in fact are placed in good homes. The poptarts are just a delicious byproduct. ; Oliver : Diablo's son. Evil genius. Possibly created by Gus and Steve. Wants to take over the world. Currently \\"driving\\" the corpse of Khan, Jr. Plot/StorylineEarly Goats= In the beginning, Jon and Phillip were geeks and they watched TV a lot. That is, when they weren't at the Peculier Pub, consuming great quantities of beer. Jon was particularly unsuccessful with women, suffered from amazingly low self-esteem and had little in the way of spine, job or coolness. He had a huge crush on a somewhat sadistic bartender at the Peculier known as Lori. Phillip was tall, Swedish and drunk. They hung out a lot with a talking goat named Toothgnip who had a way with the Ladies (later revealed to be due to his Panties of Potency). Not long into these adventures, along came a talking Satanic chicken named Diablo. Diablo and Toothgnip most certainly did not get along. For one reason or another Diablo's head kept getting blown off, severed, and variously removed from his edifice (only to be replaced later). At some stage Phillip managed to corrupt two members of an extraterrestrial species. And so Neil and Bob (pun intended) became new and omnisexual members of the cast. Shazam Twix The Shazam Twix storyline is told by Diablo in a series of flashbacks. Many parts of the story are clearly meant to be fiction within the goats continuity, although Gregor Mendel, who is introduced in these storylines, has made appearances in the primary storyline. =Post \\"Soft Reset\\" Goats= There were 26 series (plus 2 guest artist series) after the destruction of Earth that gradually prepared the characters and readers for large changes that were happening in the comic. Character development Diablo has grown away from his overtly evil ways and has become a softer, often more gullible father-figure. Oliver, however, absorbed that lost maliciousness and has shown with a fiery brilliance, a well of evil within himself that dwarfs many of the \\"bad\\" things that Diablo had ever done. Phillip and Jon remained generally the same with small tweaks in their personalities but nothing changing drastically. Fish, though, has very much been the largest change in the new strips leading into more current storylines. His alter-ego, Fineas, has taken more controls over Fish and the lovable character has become harder and more dangerous as a counter to Toothgnip and Oliver's mistreatment of the naive beer-dweller. Toothgnip has, like the majority of the comic, been often off camera. His few appearances set up the basis for much of the infinite typewriter series and beyond, showing his character in a more bitter and antagonistic vein than he had appeared before. Minor characters remained as they often had been before: supportive of major character's whims and fleetingly expendable in many cases. Plot summary The plot after the destruction of Earth became more storyline based. Instead of many, disjointed topics that left very little permanent change to the Goats multiverse, the topics began to build off each other. The problems between Fish/Fineas and Toothgnip escalated during the Space Wizard series. Diablo and Toothgnip's relationship remained strained but also grew to include Oliver. Oliver and Fineas had a limited respect for each other and began to cooperate against their common enemy. This transitional phase was primarily a way for Rosenberg to move the Goats strip away from brief one-liners into a more mature, storyline based strip. He has stated on several occasions that he is finally moving the comic in the direction that had always been at least a primary idea for his creation. Business model Goats has thrived mostly on revenue from advertising and merchandise, especially t-shirts. As a pioneer in the web- comics industry, Rosenberg once experimented with micropayments, and the experience convinced him that a business model based on them as a primary source of income would not work for Goats. Previously, \\"Premium\\" and \\"Super- Premium\\" services could be purchased which allowed access to extra content (including another Rosenberg comic, \\"Patent Pending\\", and a collection of bonus strips) for one year. These services have been discontinued indefinitely, although all the content is still on the site for previous customers. Those who would very much like to catch up on that content now seem to be out of luck. Reception Whitney Reynolds, producer of PC Magazine, pointed out that, though Goats started out as a \\"poorly drawn\\" strip, the comic has morphed into a \\"sci-fi epic spanning dimensions.\\" Books Early comics were collected in paperbacks.

A relative pronoun serves the purpose of conjoining modifying information about an antecedent referent in the main clause of a sentence. An example is the word that in the sentence \\"This is the house that Jack built.\\" Here the relative pronoun that conjoins the relative clause \\"Jack built,\\" which modifies the noun house in the main sentence. That has an anaphoric relationship to its antecedent \\"house\\" in the main clause. In the English language, the following are the most common relative pronouns: which, that, whose, whoever, whomever, who and whom. According to some dependency grammar theories, a relative pronoun does not simply mark the subordinate (relative) clause but also may be considered to play the role of a noun within that clause. For example, in the relative clause \\"that Jack built\\" given above, the pronoun \\"that\\" may be construed to syntactically function as the object of the verb \\"built.\\" Compare this with \\"Jack built the house after he married,\\" where the conjunction after marks the subordinate clause after he married, but does not play the role of any noun within that clause. In a relative clause, a relative pronoun takes the number (singular or plural) and the person (first, second or third) of its antecedent. For more information on the formation and uses of relative clauses‚Äîwith and without relative pronouns‚Äîsee Relative clause. For detailed information about relative clauses and relative pronouns in English, see English relative clause. Antecedents The element in the main clause that the relative pronoun in the relative clause stands for (house in the above example) is the antecedent of that pronoun. In most cases the antecedent is a nominal (noun or noun phrase), though the pronoun can also refer to a whole proposition, as in \\"The train was late, which annoyed me greatly\\", where the antecedent of the relative pronoun which is the clause \\"The train was late\\" (the thing that annoyed me was the fact of the train's being late). In a free relative clause, a relative pronoun has no antecedent: the relative clause itself plays the role of the co-referring element in the main clause. For example, in \\"I like what you did\\", what is a relative pronoun, but without an antecedent. The clause what you did itself plays the role of a nominal (the object of like) in the main clause. A relative pronoun used this way is sometimes called a fused relative pronoun, since the antecedent appears fused into the pronoun (what in this example can be regarded as a fusion of that which). Absence Not all relative clauses contain relative pronouns. Some languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, do not have relative pronouns at all, and form relative clauses (or their equivalents) by different methods. English can also make relative clauses without relative pronouns in some cases. For example, in \\"The man you saw yesterday was my uncle\\", the relative clause you saw yesterday contains no relative pronoun. It can be said to have a gap, or zero, in the position of the object of the verb saw. Role Other arguments can be relativised using relative pronouns: ;Subject: Hunter is the boy who helped Jessica. ;Indirect object: Hunter is the boy to whom Jessica gave a gift./Hunter is the boy whom Jessica gave a gift to. ;Prepositional complement: Jack built the house in which I now live. (Similarly with prepositions and prepositional phrases in general, for example, These are the walls between which Jack ran.) ;Possessor: Jack is the boy whose friend built my house. Variant forms In some languages with gender, number, and noun declensions‚Äîsuch as German, Serbo-Croatian, and Latin‚Äîthe relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and number, while its case indicates its relationship with the verb in the relative or main clause. In some other languages, the relative pronoun is an invariable word. Words used as relative pronouns often originally had other functions. For example, the English which is also an interrogative word. This suggests that relative pronouns might be a fairly late development in many languages. Some languages, such as Welsh, have no relative pronouns. In English, different pronouns are sometimes used if the antecedent is a human being, as opposed to a non-human or an inanimate object (as in who vs. that). :(1) This is a bank. This bank accepted my identification. :(2) She is a bank teller. She helped us open an account. With the relative pronouns, sentences (1) and (2) would read like this: :(3) This is the bank that accepted my identification. :(4) She is the bank teller who helped us open an account. In sentences (3) and (4), the words that and who are the relative pronouns. The word that is used because the bank is a thing; the word who is used because the teller is a person. Alternatively, which is often used in defining (or restrictive) relative clauses in either case. For details see English relative clauses.

The name is a contraction of the French elasticit√© invariable (elastically invariable). It was invented by Charles √âdouard Guillaume, a Swiss physicist who also invented Invar, another alloy of nickel and iron with very low thermal expansion. Guillaume won the 1920 Nobel Prize in Physics for these discoveries, which shows how important these alloys were for scientific instruments. Elinvar originally consisted of 52% iron, 36% nickel, and 12% chromium. It is almost non-magnetic, and corrosion resistant. Other variations of the elinvar alloy are * Iron- and cobalt-based ferromagnetic elinvar alloy * Manganese- and chromium-based anti-ferromagnetic elinvar alloy * Palladium-based non-magnetic elinvar alloy The largest use of elinvar was in balance springs for mechanical watches and chronometers. A major cause of inaccuracy in watches and clocks was that ordinary steels used in springs lost elasticity slightly as the temperature increased, so the balance wheel would oscillate more slowly back and forth, and the clock would lose time. Chronometers and precision watches required complex temperature-compensated balance wheels for accurate timekeeping. Springs made of elinvar, and other low temperature coefficient alloys such as Nivarox that followed, were not affected by temperature, so they made the temperature-compensated balance wheel obsolete.

A popular joke of the period was that, like the British economy of 1951, \\"It had no visible means of support\\".  Construction  The Skylon at the Festival of Britain, 1951 BW Lee (1) The Skylon was the ‚ÄúVertical Feature‚Äù that was an abiding symbol of the Festival of Britain. It was designed by Hidalgo Moya, Philip Powell and Felix Samuely, and fabricated by Painter Brothers of Hereford, England, on London's South Bank between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. The Skylon consisted of a steel latticework frame, pointed at both ends and supported on cables slung between three steel beams. The partially constructed Skylon was rigged vertically, then grew taller in situ. The architects' design was made structurally feasible by the engineer Felix Samuely who, at the time, was a lecturer at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in Bedford Square, Bloomsbury. The base was nearly 15 metres (50 feet) from the ground, with the top nearly 90 metres (300 feet) high. The frame was clad in aluminium louvres lit from within at night. Night time view of the Skylon Questions were asked in Parliament regarding the danger to visitors from lightning-strikes to the Skylon, and the papers reported that it was duly roped off at one point, in anticipation of a forecast thunderstorm. =Name= The name was suggested by Mrs A G S Fidler, wife of the chief architect of the Crawley Development Corporation.The Times, Saturday, Nov 11, 1950 Moya wrote, \\"We were unimpressed at first but soon came to accept that, by combining the suggestions of Pylon, Sky and Nylon (a fascinating new material in 1951), it was wonderfully descriptive name which has lasted forty years, considerably longer than the structure itself.\\"Hidalgo Moya, \\"Rebuild the Skylon!\\" =Incidents= A few days before the King and Queen visited the exhibition in May 1951, Skylon was climbed at midnight by student Philip Gurdon from Birkbeck College who attached a University of London Air Squadron scarf near the top.

An investigation was carried out by the Front Row programme on BBC Radio 4 and the result was broadcast on 8 March 2011. It was revealed that the Skylon and the roof of the Dome of Discovery had been sold to George Cohen and Sons, scrap metal dealers of Wood Lane, Hammersmith, and dismantled at their works in Bidder Street, Canning Town, on the banks of the River Lea.

This term is often used in an employment or human resources context where rather than terminating employees for first or minor infractions, there is a system of escalating responses intended to correct the negative behavior rather than to punish the employee. In an employment context, the concept of just cause is usually at the root of progressive discipline practices. Just cause is a principle in collective bargaining contracts that forces employers to prove their grievances against employees. History Progressive discipline evolved out of labor disputes and collective bargaining practices. Sonnenstuhl, William J., et al. \\"Employee assistance and drug testing: Fairness and injustice in the workplace.\\" Nova L. Rev. 11 (1986): 709. Prior to the widespread implementation of 'Just Cause' clauses in union contracts, it was not uncommon to see onerous hidden requirements of employment for workers. Among the most famous is Ford's insistence on investigating the personal lives of his employees and issuing terminations for those whose personal life he deemed unseemly. Process The typical stages of progressive discipline in a workplace are: # Counseling or a verbal warning; # A written warning; # Suspension or demotion; and # Termination. The stage chosen for a particular infraction will depend on a variety of factors that include the severity of the infraction, the previous work history of the employee and how the choice will affect others in the organization. Also inherent in progressive discipline is regression to previous stages once enough time passes.

Voluntary male circumcision reduces the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from HIV+ women to men. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) stated that male circumcision is an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention if carried out by medical professionals under safe conditions. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that circumcision reduces the risk that a man will acquire HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from an infected female partner. Efficacy Heterosexual couples = A 2009 systematic review from the Cochrane Collaboration reported strong evidence that medical male circumcision reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by about 60%, while adverse events are rare, and recommended inclusion of male circumcision in HIV prevention guidelines. The number needed to treat, to prevent one HIV infection during ten years, is between five and fifteen men. The UNAIDS/WHO/SACEMA Expert Group on Modelling the Impact and Cost of Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention found \\"large benefits\\" of circumcision in settings with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision prevalence. The Group estimated \\"one HIV infection being averted for every five to fifteen male circumcisions performed, and costs to avert one HIV infection ranging from US$150 to US$900 using a 10-y time horizon\\". The World Health Organisation states that circumcision is \\"highly cost-effective\\" in comparison to other HIV interventions when data from the South African trial are used, but less cost- effective when data from the Ugandan trial are used. = Men who have sex with men = A 2008 meta-analysis of gay and bisexual men (52% circumcised) found that the rate of HIV infection was not lower among men who were circumcised. For men who engaged primarily in insertive anal sex, no effect was observed. Observational studies included in the meta-analysis that were conducted prior to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 demonstrated a protective effect for circumcised men who have sex with men (MSM) against HIV infection. Reviews in 2011 and 2018 found some evidence that circumcision was protective in MSM. A 2019 meta-analysis of MSM found circumcision was associated with a 42% reduction in the odds of HIV in low and middle income countries, but not in high income countries. The CDC stated in 2013: \\"There are as yet no convincing data to help determine whether male circumcision will have any effect on HIV risk for men who engage in anal sex with either a female or male partner, as either the insertive or receptive partner.\\" Recommendations In 2007, the WHO reviewed the totality of evidence concerning male circumcision and HIV, and issued joint recommendations with UNAIDS. The recommendations included that male circumcision is an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention and that the promotion of male circumcision is an additional strategy for the prevention of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men. Kim Dickson, coordinator of the working group that authored the report, commented in part that circumcision \\"would have greatest impact\\" in countries with relatively high heterosexual HIV transmission rates (greater than 15%) and low circumcision rates (less than 20%). She further commented that circumcision is not full protection and that other methods of HIV prevention are still important in circumcised males. Because the evidence that circumcision prevents HIV mainly comes from studies conducted in Africa, the Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) has questioned the applicability of those studies to developed countries. Circumcision has not been included in their HIV prevention recommendations. The KNMG policy statement says that the relationship between HIV transmission and circumcision is unclear, and that behavioral factors seem to have more of an effect on HIV prevention than circumcision. The KNMG also recommends that the choice of circumcision should be put off until an age when a possible HIV risk reduction would be relevant, so that boys can decide for themselves whether to undergo the procedure or choose other prevention alternatives. This KNMG circumcision policy statement was endorsed by several Dutch medical associations. In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) led a 2012 task force which included the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The task force policy statement, found that circumcision may be helpful for the prevention of HIV in the United States. The AAP task force policy was endorsed by the ACOG. The CDC expressed uncertainty if circumcision would help in the United States, stating the transmission patterns in the U.S. vary from those studied in the primary studies examined, namely the U.S. has a higher prevalence of MSM transmission. In line with the AAP task force, the CDC 2018 position on circumcision and HIV recommended that circumcision should continue to be offered to parents who are informed of the benefits and risks, including a potential reduction in risk of HIV transmission. The CDC says that circumcision can be done in adulthood, when the man can make a decision for himself. However, they note that circumcision conducted after sexual debut, can result in missed opportunities for HIV prevention.  Process  The WHO recommends voluntary medical male circumcision, as opposed to circumcision by traditional healers or untrained individuals. Newly circumcised men must refrain from sexual activity until the wounds are fully healed. Some circumcised men might have a false sense of security that could lead to increased risky sexual behavior. Mechanism of action Experimental evidence supports the theory that Langerhans cells (part of the human immune system) in foreskin may be a source of entry for the HIV virus. Excising the foreskin removes what is thought to be a main entry point for the HIV virus. History Map showing prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa based on 1999‚Äì2001 figures Valiere Alcena, in a 1986 letter to the New York State Journal of Medicine, noted that low rates of circumcision in parts of Africa had been linked to the high rate of HIV infection. Aaron J. Fink several months later also proposed that circumcision could have a preventive role when the New England Journal of Medicine published his letter, \\"A possible explanation for heterosexual male infection with AIDS,\\" in October, 1986. By 2000, over 40 epidemiological studies had been conducted to investigate the relationship between circumcision and HIV infection. A meta-analysis conducted by researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine examined 27 studies of circumcision and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and concluded that these showed circumcision to be \\"associated with a significantly reduced risk of HIV infection\\" that could form part of a useful public health strategy. A 2005 review of 37 observational studies expressed reservations about the conclusion because of possible confounding factors, since all studies to date had been observational as opposed to randomized controlled trials. The authors stated that three randomized controlled trials then underway in Africa would provide \\"essential evidence\\" about the effects of circumcision on preventing HIV. In 2009, a Cochrane review which included the results of the three 2000s trials found \\"strong\\" evidence that the acquisition of HIV by a man during sex with a woman was decreased by 38% and 66% over 24 months if the man was circumcised. The review also found a low incidence of adverse effects from circumcision in the trials reviewed. In 2020, a review including post-study follow up from the three randomized controlled trials, as well as newer observational studies, found a 59% reduction in HIV incidence across the three randomized controlled trials, as well as continued protection for up to 6 years after the studies began. In 2011, a Cochrane review of observational studies found that circumcision may provide some protection for men during insertive anal sex with men, but noted that there have been no randomized controlled trials examining men who have sex with men and circumcision and that the evidence is not as strong as for heterosexual intercourse.  Society and culture  The prevalence of circumcision varies across Africa. Studies were conducted to assess the acceptability of promoting circumcision; in 2007, country consultations and planning to scale up male circumcision programmes took place in Botswana, Eswatini, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. =Programs= In 2011, UNAIDS prioritized 14 high HIV prevalence countries in eastern and southern Africa, with a goal of circumcising 80% of men (20.8 million) by the end of 2016.Joint strategic action framework to accelerate the scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV prevention in Eastern and Southern Africa, 2012-2016. WHO. 2014. In parallel, WHO developed a Framework for evaluating new, simpler circumcision techniques, which gave impetus to the development of two new devices (Prepex and Shang Ring) that are currently being scaled-up in the 14 high HIV prevalence countries. Overall, 14.5 million males were circumcised as of the end of 2016. UNAIDS' Fast-Track Plan for ending the AIDS Epidemic by 2030 calls for an additional 25 million circumcisions in these high-priority countries by 2020, which will require to 5 million procedures per year, nearly double the current rate. To reach this goal, UNAIDS is counting on advances in circumcision techniques.

His renowned input method, created in 1976 and given to the public domain in 1982, has sped up the computerization of Chinese society. Chu spent his childhood in Taiwan, and has worked in Brazil, United States, Taiwan, Shenzhen and Macau. History Chu was born in 1937 in Huanggang, Hubei to father Chu Wan-in, also called Chu Huai-ping(). His family led a wandering life during the turbulent days of mainland China, and they finally settled down in Taiwan. There he studied at a local high school. He was an imaginative teenager who spent so much time reading fiction that it negatively affected his studies. Later he also became interested in cinema. After graduating from Taiwan Provincial Agriculture Institute and his military service, he taught briefly at an elementary school in Hualien. In this period he witnessed the poverty of countryside, and developed a sense of mission for rural development and cultural improvement. Finding teaching not to his taste, he went to Brazil instead to develop his career, only to find life more difficult. Over that period of time, he took up several jobs. It was also during these turbulent times that Chu flirted with the hippie lifestyle and studied at a local conservatory.Chu Bong-Foo. Êô∫ÊÖß‰πãÊóÖ [His autobiography]. Volume 1. 1999. Hong Kong:Culturecom. Online resource. Retrieved 2007-01-20. Tsang-chieh However, his work on Tsang-chieh did not begin until he worked at \\"Cultural Abril\\", a publishing house in Brazil, in 1972. From then on, he would dedicate his life to modernizing Chinese information technology. He saw for himself how the Brazilians could, in just one day, translate and publish foreign literature, while the Chinese took at least a year. The technology then, coupled with the complexities of the Chinese script, required a painstaking process of picking up type pieces from an enormous Chinese character set. Besides, publishers often encountered characters not included in their set. This meant that the printing of any information in Chinese was much slower than in other languages. In 1973, he returned to Taiwan. He gathered a team to study an efficient method of looking up a character with 26 keys on the common keyboard. Existing methods of looking up a Chinese character such as looking for its radicals, zhuyin, or romanization give only ambiguous results. On the other hand, while Chinese script has no alphabet, most characters are compounds of a common set of components. Chu assumed that it was possible to encode Chinese characters with a group of 'Chinese alphabets' which can be mapped on a common keyboard. After studying dictionary cut-outs and conducting many tests, the team released a table of 8,000 encoded characters in 1976. This result was unsatisfactory for general use but did however prove the possibility of encoding Chinese in this way. Chu then enlisted more help, including that of Shen Hung-lian () from the Department of Chinese Literature, National Taiwan University. At the same time, Chu also learned about An Wang's encoding scheme. On one hand, Wang's scheme further confirmed the feasibility of the encoding approach. On the other hand, it inspired Chu to think that his encoding scheme should not only be convenient for looking up a character, it should also take the form of the characters into account to make it possible to compose (draw) the character from a code. Chu assumed this could be achieved with the following three steps: # choosing adequate rules of decomposition of characters # choosing an adequate set of forms as the common components # encoding the common components (with \\"Chinese alphabets\\") To achieve these steps, the team employed a principle similar to the \\"pictophonetic compounds\\" principle of Chinese. In 1977 the team released the first generation of the method that would later be named \\"Tsang-chieh\\". The team selected a set of less than 2,000 components to compose about 12,000 common characters. Each component is represented by a permutation of 1 to 3 of 26 \\"Chinese alphabets\\" (also called \\"radicals\\"). Each \\"alphabet\\" maps to a particular letter key on a standard QWERTY keyboard. In 1978, he implemented the method with computer technology, making it a Chinese input method for computers. The ROC Defense Minister Chiang Wei-kuo gave the input method the name \\"Tsang-chieh\\". Chu put Tsang-chieh method in the public domain in a bold effort to promote Chinese computing, essentially giving up his rights to any royalty. His contribution led many future Chinese systems to come bundled with a free copy of the Tsang-chieh input method, removing the greatest barrier to effective Chinese input systems. Since then, many adaptations of Chu's methods have also appeared. Over generations of upgrades, Chu's Tsang-chieh has included more and more characters. The fifth generation, released in 1985, included 60,000 characters. \\"Chinese computer\\" During the development of Tsang-chieh method, Chu found that his invention is not only an input method, but also a character encoding method for computing systems. Unlike An Wang's encoding method of the time, or later methods such as Big5 and Unicode, Tsang- chieh method does not sort characters by their usage frequency, stroke count, or radical, but is based on their composition aspect and inspired by the \\"pictophonetic compounds\\" principle of Chinese. Chu therefore began to develop a theory (which he would later call \\"Chinese DNA\\", \\"Alphabets of Chinese Language\\", or \\"Chinese character gene\\" theory). The theory states that the forms selected by Chu are the \\"genes\\" of Chinese. Proper arrangement of these \\"genes\\" can provide all functions of the characters. Therefore, Tsang-chieh method as a character encoding is very useful, since it contains not only an ordered set of characters, but also precise references of shapes, pronunciations and semantics of the characters. Therefore, the system is an efficient base for a variety of Chinese information technology: smart dictionary; operating system and application software; programming language; hardware architecture of PC and embedded systems; and even strong artificial intelligence.Culturecom. Chu Bong-Foo. Êº¢Â≠óÂü∫Âõ† . 2000. Retrieved 2007-01-20. In 1979, he invented a character generator program, which takes Tsang-chieh encoded data and dynamically generates Chinese characters for screen display. In the same year, Chu's team collaborated with the Acer company, and the program became incorporated in the firmware of a \\"Chinese computer\\". Later the generator was also used in the \\"Tsang-chieh controller board\\", which would enable an Apple II computer to display Chinese characters in its hi-res graphics mode. A particular interesting \\"feature\\" of this early system was that it would also take and generate characters not explicitly included in the codepage, but implied by the rules of Tsang-chieh.Taipei: Chwa!

Publication number 023479. - This is the user manual of an early Tsang-chieh system with a Tsang-chieh controller card. Since then, Chu has held unique views on Chinese information technology. He considered input using ordinary keyboards more feasible and compatible than speech and handwriting recognition or specialized keyboard. However, many of his other opinions have been at odds with consensus: * He uses a nationalist rhetoric on the subject. * He values written Classical Chinese over various forms of vernacular Chinese. He also values it over many synthetic languages and their writing systems in the world. * On the encoding issue, he said that the proposed Big5 13,053 characters codepage too small and too fixed. * On the display of Chinese, he believes that the job should be done by the \\"calculation\\" of a computer's central processing unit, while the use of lookup tables and storage units should be kept to a minimum. * He believes that Chinese information technology should take second-mover advantage and choose an alternative path from then- established Western theories. * He also believes that the technology should be rooted in levels as basic and economical as possible. Instead of providing Chinese access at the operating system and application level on standard PC platforms, he believes it should be available at much lower levels using specialized firmware and hardware, which can be used in a wide variety of products. He also believes some programming languages containing syntax and tokens based on (Classical) Chinese language are necessary. Demonstration of character generator Mingzhu's capability of generating the characters according to the codes. None of the examples are included in Unicode. The first character is which is for a kind of soup in Xuzhou. Other characters are never recorded. Mingzhu was modified from Juzhen. In early 1990s, when the Chinese version of Microsoft Windows 3.0 attempted to enter Taiwanese market, Chu and some partners competed with it and advocated for more independence of Chinese information technology. Chu worked in Shenzhen with a group of developers and produced a software application for Chinese integration, called \\"Juzhen\\" (), stood up against this strong force. It was released to the public domain, and distributed through the Rexun magazine. Between Chu and the financially strong Microsoft, the odds were against the former. However, Chu's engine had the benefit of space: in Chu's engine, a font containing 13095 characters took up at most a megabyte each and fit snugly on a floppy disk as compared to the 3‚Äì5 megabytes required by competitors' products. This strong advantage of Chu's technology led a sizeable number of technology companies to initiate discussions with Chu for a transfer of technology rights. Soon after, Jinmei (), Zangzhu () and other budget font makers swamped the market, forcing prices down and ensuring that every user could afford original copies of Chinese typefaces. After \\"Juzhen\\" system, Chu left Taiwan for Macau. In 1999, he was appointed vice chairman of Culturecom Corporation. Seven years with Culturecom Since 1999, Chu became a vice chairman of Hong Kong- and Macau- based Culturecom Corporation, Chu's team has been cooperating with Culturalcom until 2006 when Culturecom terminated this partnership. Several products and technology were developed respectively, and resulted a series of E-book device with several names such as ÊñáÊòå, ËíºÈ†°. The core of the device is \\"Culturecom 1610\\", a RISC, System-on-a-chip \\"Chinese CPU\\" that includes a character generator. The device also features a \\"Cholesterol\\" LCD, which saves electricity. The device, similar to India's Simputer, features simple architecture and low cost. Chu's team designed it as an affordable electronic textbook for poor rural population. They also wished it to be the platform of a rural wireless network project named \\"eTown\\". However, up to 2006, these ideals were not realized. . In 2002, some details of the product were released to LGPL by the two parties. Although the device did not take-off as expected, its technologies were employed by some other companies in their products, such as Kolin's i-library. During this period, Chu's team was also interested in Virtual cinematography. They have released several feature length animation films. Chu also gave more elaboration on his \\"Chinese DNA\\" theory.

Shot welding is a type of spot welding used to join two pieces of metal together. This is accomplished by clamping the two pieces together and then passing a large electric current through them for a short period of time. Shot welding was invented by Earl J. Ragsdale, a mechanical engineer at the Budd Company, in 1932 to weld stainless steel. This welding method was used to construct the Pioneer Zephyr. The method The E. G. Budd Company of Philadelphia recognized the important metallurgical characteristics of 18/8 stainless steel (known today as SAE 304 austenitic stainless steel) and developed a spot welding process to take advantage of the oxidized layer on the surface of stainless steel. Heat treating the 18-8 stainless steel leaves the metal with non-magnetic and ductile properties. Repeatedly reheating the metal to 1000‚Äì1100 ¬∞C impairs the mechanical and chemical properties of the metal. The metal becomes susceptible to corrosion due to carbide precipitation, and loses fatigue resistance. The important factor in controlling the metal's properties is the dwell time at those temperatures. Using a controlled time element and recorder, a power supply with smooth current, and very brief high currents, a satisfactory spot weld may be produced. The corona of the shot weld should not exist on the metal, and the equipment used produces satisfactory welds with a smaller than normal diameter. Sufficient electrode force is applied to hold the two sheets of metal together and the peak current rapidly creates a forge weld at the interface between the two sheets, producing a small nugget of weld metal, which when cooled results in a shear-resistant metal interface. Good shotwelds have twice the shear strength of a rivet of similar diameter and can be placed 50% closer together. Distortion is eliminated, as this is an issue in fusion welding processes.

The studio along with Culver Studios is owned by Hackman Capital Partners and exclusively leased to ViacomCBS. Designed by architect William Pereira, it is one of two CBS television studios in southern California ‚Äì the other is CBS Studio Center, located in the Studio City section of the San Fernando Valley, which houses additional production facilities and the network's Los Angeles local television operations (KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV). Since 1961, it has served as the master control facility for CBS's west coast television network operations which were previously based at Columbia Square. Since its inauguration in 1952, numerous TV shows have been broadcast live or taped at Television City, including many shows not aired on CBS. It has also been the production site of several films such as the 1996 feature That Thing You Do!, starring Tom Hanks and Liv Tyler. During the opening credits of many of the shows taped here, a voice-over announced the phrase \\"from Television City in Hollywood\\". The complex currently houses a total of eight separate studios. The facility infrequently conducts backstage tours led by a CBS page.  History  CBS planned to move most of its entertainment operations to the Los Angeles area in 1950. As they needed additional space beyond its Columbia Square complex on Sunset Boulevard, CBS purchased the property at Fairfax Avenue and Beverly Boulevard that year. Hiring architect William Pereira, the company reportedly spent $7 million on the studio. Television City opened on November 16, 1952. It was built on the site of a former football field and race track, Gilmore Stadium. Before the stadium, it was an oil field. Studio 43 was equipped with RCA TK-40A color cameras in 1954, with cables allowing any of the original four studios to use those cameras. In 1956, Studio 41 was equipped with RCA TK-41s. However, CBS color broadcasts decreased in frequency until the following decade, when the 1964 production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella was recorded. CBS programs were, in general, in black-and-white until Norelco PC-60s were installed starting in 1964. Studio 33 is the current home of the long-running CBS game show The Price Is Right and the HBO late- night series Real Time with Bill Maher. This soundstage was also the home of The Carol Burnett Show for its entire 1967‚Äì1978 run, and The Red Skelton Show prior to that (1953‚Äì1970), as well as the notable game shows Match Game (the 1973‚Äì82 Gene Rayburn-hosted version, and the 1998 version), The $25,000/$100,000 Pyramid (the 1980s run), Hollywood Squares (hosted by Tom Bergeron), Wheel of Fortune, the 1986‚Äì1989 revival of Card Sharks, the 1983‚Äì86 version of Press Your Luck, and the 1988‚Äì1995 run of Family Feud. On April 9, 1998, on the 5,000th episode of The Price Is Right (actually number 5,133), CBS named Studio 33 as the Bob Barker Studio in honor of the show's longtime host and executive producer. When it became standard for sitcoms to tape in front of a studio audience in the 1970s, many shows were recorded on soundstages at Television City, such as All in the Family, Maude, and Good Times. The ABC sitcoms Three's Company and Welcome Back, Kotter were also taped at Television City. CBS Television City is also home to CBS's visual effects studio, CBS Digital, and the CBS Records music label. \\"Television City\\" is a registered trademark of CBS for its TV production facilities. In September 2017, CBS investigated selling the property due to a development boom in the Fairfax District. As a result of this possibility, the city of Los Angeles is taking steps (as of May 2018) to officially declare the facility a historic and cultural monument. CBS Corp. sold Television City to Los Angeles real estate investment company Hackman Capital Partners for $750 million in a deal finalized in mid-December 2018. The deal gives the buyer the right to use the Television City name. Programs produced at Television City, including The Price Is Right, The Young and the Restless and The Late Late Show with James Corden, will continue to be based at Television City, as will the headquarters of the CBS international unit.  Architecture  The stark modern architecture at Television City consists of black and white planes meeting at razor-sharp corners, with accents of dazzling red, the work of Pereira & Luckman of Los Angeles. The studio facility was built to handle the larger production needs for the network, most of which took place at the rather cramped Columbia Square. The building's black and white color scheme was also used to identify areas where it was designed to be expanded. Black walls and glass walls indicated \\"temporary\\" structure that could be removed during expansion, while white areas were \\"permanent\\". The building initially held four soundstages (Studios 31, 33, 41, and 43), but a renovation in the late 1980s added two new soundstages to the east of the original building (Studios 36 and 46), plus additional office/storage space and technical facilities. Later, another renovation further added two more studios (Studios 56 and 58) in what had been rehearsal halls in the original building. The original plans for Television City called for 24 soundstages, before CBS executives deciding to settle with just the initial four.

The first Anglo-Europeans to visit the area was explorer Edward Eyre in 1840 and the surveyor George Goyder in 1857. There was a small failed settlement nearby, at the Yudnamutana copper mine, from 1860 to 1863. The drought of 1863 drove the miners away. Settlement didn't occur again until 1903, when rubies and sapphires were discovered. By 1910 a copper smelter was built at Yudnamutana and uranium was also discovered nearby by Douglas Mawson, famous Antarctic explorer. The land was always marginal and projects failed quickly. Uranium exploration persisted sporadically and led to the development of good roads by optimistic companies. The Arkaroola property was fenced by 1935 and a process of eradication of pests started. The land was covered with donkeys and camels. There was a failed health project in 1948. The Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary was established by geologist Reg Sprigg in 1968 after he purchased the pastoral lease. He had been involved in surveys in the area before that. He purchased the pastoral lease (part of which is now held as freehold) and began the conversion to a wildlife sanctuary.traveller.com. Arkaroola. Accessed 6 February 2018. In 1979 he was a trustee of the World Wildlife Fund due to his work in the protection of the yellow-footed rock-wallaby. In July 2011 South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced a ban on mining in Arkaroola. This was followed in October 2011 by special purpose legislation prohibiting mining, mining exploration and grazing in the ranges. The South Australian government has moved to nominate the Arkaroola area for listing on the National Heritage list, and to secure its nomination for World Heritage listing.Daily Telegraph, 22 July 2011Arkaroola's savior Premier Mike Rann to visit area, Sunday Mail, 15 October 2011 Arkaroola was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 27 July 2012. Mining Until mid-2011, Arkaroola was under threat from uranium mining; the Adelaide-based mining company Marathon Resources had been prospecting the area around Mount Gee. In 2008, Marathon was found guilty of illegally dumping radioactive waste in a variety of locations throughout the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary, and were ordered to suspend drilling operations. In late 2010, the government renewed the company's mineral exploration license, allowing it to resume exploratory drilling within the protected area, a decision which resulted in public outcry. A poll taken in February 2011 showed that 72 per cent of South Australians, and 79 per cent of Labor voters, were opposed to mining in Arkaroola. Following unprecedented public pressure, the South Australian government announced on 22 July 2011 that mining would be banned forever in Arkaroola, with the aim of national and World Heritage listing. Mining companies have since threatened legal action against the government. Protection of Arkaroola from mining, including Mount Gee and the Mount Painter inlier, is provided by the Arkaroola Protection Act 2012, which created the Arkaroola Protection Area. Birds Arkaroola is part of the Gammon Ranges and Arkaroola Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports a population of the restricted- range short-tailed grasswren as well as populations of the pied honeyeater, chirruping wedgebill and cinnamon quail-thrush. Tourist activities 4WD Touring on the Echo Camp Backtrack- Arkaroola Typical lodgings =Road loops and 4WD tracks= There are self-drive and organised tour tracks for 2-wheel drives and 4-wheel drives, ranging from beginner to advanced in difficulty. The Echo Camp Backtrack self-drive track leads through some wonderful country and then over the hills (rough) and down onto the plains east of the Flinders Ranges. This joins another track back to Arkaroola via Claude‚Äôs Pass, Stubb‚Äôs Waterhole, Bararranna Gorge (an area where yellow-footed rock wallabies are commonly found), Welcome Pound and back to the main road to the Arkaroola Village. Organised tours provide trips along the ridge top track with three lookouts that end at Siller's Lookout, providing a view across the plains towards Lake Frome and the Beverley Uranium Mine. Siller's Lookout is named after Bill Siller MBE, whose uranium exploration companies constructed the Ridge Top Tour track in the late 1960s. Beverley Uranium Mine, also discovered by Bill Siller's companies, is named after his wife, Beverley. The track was put in by Mr Jim Hodgekinson, an expatriate Canadian. =Bushwalking= There are a number of walking trails available, guided and self-guided, some are marked and described by the Royal Geographical Society of Australia (SA). * Spriggina Trail (1 to 1.5 hrs) * Bararranna Gorge Walk (6.8 km - 3.5 hrs) * Acacia Ridge (4 to 5 hrs) *Surveyor's Cairn (40 mins) *Griselda Hill (1.5 hrs) *Mawson Valley Trail (2.5 to 3 hrs) *Arkaroola Waterhole (4 hrs) *Oppaminda Trail (length depends on starting point) Coloured leaflets about some of these trails at Arkaroola and throughout the Flinders Ranges are available for download from the Walking Trails Support Group. =Astronomy= Arkaroola has two 14-inch telescopes. Weather in the area is usually fine providing clear skies. There is little light pollution, due to the remote location and active control of the local lighting. =Paralana radioactive springs= Paralana geothermal springs are located on Wooltana, north of Arkaroola. Local granite rocks contain elevated levels of uranium that gives off heat during radioactive decay. Water percolating through fractures in the rock is heated and bubbles out at the surface as a hot spring, with gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, radon and helium. Due to the presence of radon gas, which is heavier than air, staying near the springs for a prolonged period may constitute a health hazard. Living on the floor of the springs is an extremophile algal mat that survives the warm temperatures of 62 ¬∞C and high radioactivity. =The Pinnacle= The mountain summit in the area under this name is of volcanic origin (basalt) and is popular for rock climbing. The Village Accommodation ranges from motel rooms to caravan and camp sites. Facilities include a licensed restaurant and bar, swimming pool, small shop, service station (petrol and diesel), and a vehicle workshop. Climate The climate of the area is arid, summers are hot with occasional storms, while winters are cold and dry. Arkaroola holds the record for the highest minimum temperature ever recorded in Australia, an overnight low of occurred on the 24 January 1982. ReferencesFurther reading * Reg C. Sprigg (1984).

He was a famous translator into Hebrew. He was noted for his loyalty to the original text, while preserving the spirit of the Hebrew language, which he characterized as a biblical and liturgical language. Salkinsohn was born as a Jew in the town of Shklo≈≠, in Belarus, in 1820. His father was a scholar, well known throughout the area, even though he was not a rabbi. When Salkinsohn was still a small child, his mother died and his father remarried. Salkinsohn, who was the youngest of his mother‚Äôs children, suffered greatly under his new stepmother, but was very close with his father. At the age of 17, he left his father and decided to run away to Mahilyow. After news of an impending army conscription he moved to a nearby village, in the house of the barkeeper. In the village he became friendly with the hazzan and helped him deal with religious issues. While there, an interest in secular studies and general enlightenment was kindled in Salkinsohn. Meanwhile, the barkeeper planned to marry his granddaughter to Salkinsohn. When Salkinsohn learned of this, he revealed it to the hazzan, who helped him sneak away and get to Vilnius, then called Vilna. In Vilna Salkinsohn met the Eliashevitz family, and with the father‚Äôs influence studied Hebrew grammar and German, and became a great scholar. While studying in Vilna, he caught the eye of the Eliashevitz daughter, and translated his first translation. Already in this translation, the first act of Schiller‚Äôs Kabale und Liebe (translated into Hebrew as ‚Äò‚ÄôNechelim veAhavim‚Äô‚Äô), his talent was apparent. However, as the Eliashevitz daughter did not return his courtship, he left her house and began wandering. He was planning to arrive in Germany and resume his studies, but for unclear reasons changed his course and decided to go to London. In London Salkinsohn met Christian missionaries and converted in 1849. He was appointed a Presbyterian pastor in 1856 (some say 1859) and began working as a missionary in 1864. In 1876 he was sent as a missionary to Vienna and preached in the Anglican church there. He also began working in earnest on his translations, and frequented the salons popular at the time. There he met Peretz Smolenskin, the well known intellectual and editor of the Hebrew periodical ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Dawn‚Äô‚Äô. Smolenskin, after he realized Salkinsohn‚Äôs considerable talent for translation, encouraged him to translate the world‚Äôs great literature into Hebrew. Salkinsohn represented two opposite sides for educated Jewry of the period. On one hand, he was making the great Western novels accessible to most Jews, and was a beautiful translator, but on the other hand, he had converted and was encouraging them to do the same. He had his share of enemies: not only did people warn against him and released slander against him, but there also were many who egged others on against his friend, Peretz Smolenskin. For many Jews of the period, even though they enjoyed his translations, it was hard to praise a Jew who had converted to Christianity, and one who translated not only literary works, but undoubtedly Christian works. Six years after he reached Vienna, on June 5, 1883, Isaac Salkinsohn died, aged 63. His most famous translations: *1871 - John Milton's Paradise Lost as Vaygaresh et ha- adam (\\"And He drove the man out\\", a phrase from Genesis 3:24). * The New Testament, published posthumously in 1886, although his translation is now difficult to find, as the one by Franz Delitzsch is more prevalent. * Two works by William Shakespeare: 1874 - Othello as Ithi'el ha-Kushi, and in 1878 - Romeo and Juliet as Ram ve-Ya'el.

The company has 85 websites in 34 languages, and lists over 325,000 hotels in approximately 19,000 locations. Its inventory includes hotels and B&Bs;, and some condos and other types of commercial lodging. Hotels.com was established in 1991 as the Hotel Reservations Network (HRN). In 2001, it became part of Expedia, Inc. and in 2002, changed its name to Hotels.com. The company is operated by Hotels.com LP, a limited partnership located in Dallas, Texas, in the United States. History Hotels.com was established in 1991 by David Litman and Robert Diener as the Hotel Reservations Network (HRN), providing hotel booking via a toll-free phone number in the United States. In 2001, the company was acquired by USA Networks Inc (USAI) which also acquired a controlling interest in Expedia, the online travel booking company. After buying the domain name for approximately US$11m, HRN changed its name in 2002 to Hotels.com and launched the offline brand 1-800-2-Hotels as well as allowing hotel bookings on line. There followed a period of rapid international expansion with 29 sites added over the next two years. In 2003, USAI was renamed InterActiveCorp (IAC). In 2005 IAC separated its travel business under the name Expedia Inc. Hotels.com then became an operating company of Expedia Inc. International growth since 2002 has included web sites for North, Central and South America, Europe, Australia, Japan, China and the Pacific Rim, the Middle East and South Africa. Web sites for Indonesia and Vietnam launched in 2011. Customers in all countries can book online or by phoning one of the multilingual call centres. Calls are both toll-free and paid, depending on the country of booking. In 2011, Hotels.com launched an iPad application and updated its mobile phone product on iPhone and Android. On December 1, 2016, Hotels.com took over Venere.com (another Expedia owned company). =U.S. disability rights infringement= In May 2007, Hotels.com was subject to a class action complaint (Smith v.

The company denied the accusation and opposed the action, but was found guilty on one count of infringing California‚Äôs Unruh Civil Rights Act, and on one count in violation of Unfair Competition Law. Hotels.com then agreed to provide suitable accessibility information about hotels sold on its website. Loyalty program Like its competitors (such as Agoda), Hotels.com has a loyalty program. This allows customers to claim discounts on most, but not all, hotels, regardless of hotel chain or type. For every 10 nights stayed at hotels booked with hotels.com, customers can claim a price reduction on a subsequent booking. This reduction is equivalent to the average amount paid for those nights. The reduction does not reduce taxes and fees payments and the accumulated nights are limited to 12 months only if there is no activity in the account, and some other restrictions apply. The program is called \\"Hotels.com Rewards\\" (formerly \\"Welcome Rewards\\") and launched in the US, Canada and much of Latin America in 2008. It then extended to the UK and Australia in 2010, and to more than 40 additional countries in 2011. Hotel Price Index Starting 2004, Hotels.com has published a twice- yearly review of international hotel room price trends called the Hotels.com Hotel Price Index based on the prices paid per room by its customers using a weighted average based on the number of rooms sold in each of the markets in which it operates. Information includes notable price changes and comparisons between destinations, hotel types, and other price-related analyses for the previous six months. The Hotel Price Index is published both digitally and in print, and is aimed at journalists, the media, and hoteliers as part of its public relations.

Roosevelt State Park is a state park in Westchester County, New York. Formerly known as Mohansic Park and Mohansic State Park, it is situated in Yorktown, approximately from New York City. The park was created in 1922 on the former site of the Mohansic State Hospital. The park includes two water bodies, Mohansic Lake and Crom Pond. History The state first acquired the park land between 1909 and 1922. The land south of Crom Pond and Mohansic Lake was acquired in 1908 for the New York State Training School for Boys. North of Crom Pond and Mohansic Lake was acquired in 1909 by the State Hospital Commission. There was concern that having a hospital so close to the New Croton Reservoir would pollute the watershed. This helped Westchester County acquire the entire park in 1922. In 1923, Westchester County grew over 20,000 specimens of pine, spruce and evergreen trees on the park grounds for transplantation to other Westchester parks. During the Great Depression, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was placed in the park, several buildings from which remain today. New York State acquired the property in 1957. It was renamed Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park in 1982. Park facilities Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park prominently features a large swimming pool with the capacity to hold 3,500 bathers at one time.

It is typically used for headers, beams, rimboard, and edge-forming material. LVL offers several advantages over typical milled lumber: Made in a factory under controlled specifications, it is stronger, straighter, and more uniform. Due to its composite nature, it is much less likely than conventional lumber to warp, twist, bow, or shrink. LVL is a type of structural composite lumber, comparable to Glued laminated timber (Glulam) but with a higher allowable stress.  History  Structural composite lumber, including LVL, are a relatively recent innovation. They are the result of new technology and economic pressure to make use of new species and smaller trees that cannot be used to make solid sawn lumber. While plywood became widespread by the early 20th century, the invention of LVL was not until the 1980s after the invention of oriented strand board. The American Wood Council's National Design Specification for Wood Construction is generally updated on a 3- to 5-year cycle. The 1991 release is the first release which mentions LVL. LVL is mentioned as a subcategory of structural glued laminated timber. The first explorations into engineered lumber happened during World War II in the United States. In 1942, an increased demand for wood caused a sudden timber shortage. The war industry utilized a panel material developed by the Homasote Company of Trenton, New Jersey, made of wood pulp and ground newspaper, to be used in place of siding and sheathing for buildings. The invention of laminated veneer lumber as known today can be attributed to Arthur Troutner. While glue laminated wood veneers were in use since the middle of the 19th century on a small scale for furniture and pianos, Troutner was the first to develop a laminated veneer lumber of a scale large enough to be used in construction. In 1971 \\"Micro=Lam LVL\\" was introduced. \\"Micro=Lam LVL\\" consisted of laminated veneer lumber billets wide, thick, and long. Troutner proved the structural capabilities of his Micro=Lam product by building a house in Hagerman, Idaho, using beams made of Micro=Lam. Most corporations considered Troutner's invention to be a niche product and it was not until the mid 1980s when logging became an environmental concern and corporations moved toward engineered lumber that LVL became widespread in use.  Qualities  Laminated veneer lumber is similar in appearance to plywood, although in plywood the veneers switch direction while stacking and in LVL the veneers all stack in the same direction. In LVL, the direction of the wood grain is always parallel to the length of the billet. Allen, Edward and Joseph Iano. Fundamentals of Building Construction: Fourth Edition. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, 2004. pg. 91 The stacking of these veneers into a complete board, called a billet, creates a single piece of LVL sharing a common direction of wood grain. LVL is typically rated by the manufacturer for elastic modulus and allowable bending stress. Common elastic moduli are ; ; and ; and common allowable bending stress values are ; and . Although the creation of LVL is often proprietary and thus its make-up is largely dependent on individual manufacturers, in general one cubic meter of North American lumber is composed of 97.54% wood, 2.41% of phenol formaldehyde resin, 0.02% of phenol- resorcinol-formaldehyde resin, and 0.03% fillers. http://www.icc.es.org/Reports/pdf_files/load_file.cfm?file_type=pdf&file;_name=ESR-1387.pdf  Manufacturing  LVL is commonly manufactured in North America by companies that also manufacture I-joists. LVL is manufactured to sizes compatible with the depth of I-joist framing members for use as beams and headers. Additionally, some manufacturers further cut LVL into sizes for use as chord- members on I-joists. In 2012, North American LVL manufacturers produced more than 1.2 million cubic metres (43.4 million cubic feet) of LVL in 18 different facilities, and in 2013 the production increased with more than 14%. It is not coincidental that LVL mills are often co-located with I-joist manufacturing facilities as many builders use a combination of I-joists and LVL in floor and roof assemblies.http://www.icc.es.org/Reports/pdf_files/load_file.cfm?file_type=pdf&file;_name=ESR-1387.pdf  Use  Because it is specifically sized to be compatible with I-joist floor framing, residential builders and building designers like the combination of I-joist and LVL floor and roof assemblies. LVL is considered to be a highly reliable building material that provides many of the same attributes associated with large sized timbers. LVL can also be used in combination with gluelam as an outer gluelam tension lam to increase the strength of the gluelam beam. However, due to the fact that the assembly adhesives limit the penetration of chemicals typically used to treat outdoor-rated lumber, LVL may not be suitable for outdoor load-bearing use. A deck built using pressure- treated LVL collapsed due to internal rotting of the twelve-year-old LVL components, although the LVL beams had passed regular visual inspections. The breakdown of LVL end uses in North America is 33% new single family residential construction, 25% residential renovations and upkeep, 8% new non- residential construction and 34% manufacturing furniture and other products.  Structural composite lumber  LVL belongs to the category of engineered wood called structural composite lumber. Other members of this category are parallel strand lumber (PSL) and laminated strand lumber (LSL). All members of this category are strong and predictable, and are thus interchangeable for some applications. PSL is made from veneers that are cut up into long strands and oriented parallel to its length before being compressed into its final shape. LSL is also made from strands rather than veneer, although the strands are shorter and aligned with less precision than PSL and is created as billets that are like a thick version of oriented strand board. Billets of PSL and LVL are very similar although their sizes are different. Billets of PSL can be as large as wide and long while LVL can range up to wide and long.

In the French prose cycles, and consequently in Le Morte d'Arthur, the hunt for the Beast is the subject of quests undertaken by Pellinore and his family and achieved by Palamedes and his companions.  Description and name  The strange creature has the head and neck of a snake, the body of a leopard, the haunches of a lion, and the feet of a hart. Its name comes from the great noise that it emits from its belly, a barking like \\"thirty couple hounds questing\\". Glatisant is related to the French word glapissant, 'yelping' or 'barking', especially of small dogs or foxes. The questing beast is a variant of the medieval mythological view on giraffes, whose generic name of Camelopardalis originated from their description of being half-camel and half-leopard. In medieval literature The Questing Beast in alt= The first accounts of the beast are found in the Perlesvaus and the Post-Vulgate Suite du Merlin. The Post-Vulgate's account, which was taken up by Thomas Malory for his seminal Le Morte d'Arthur, has the Questing Beast appear to the young King Arthur after he has had an affair with his half-sister Morgause and begotten Mordred (they did not know that they were related when the incestuous act occurred). Arthur sees the beast drinking from a pool just after he wakes from a disturbing dream that foretells Mordred's destruction of the realm. He is then approached by King Pellinore, who confides that it is his family quest to hunt the beast. Merlin reveals that the Questing Beast had been born of a human woman, a princess who lusted after her own brother. She slept with a devil who had promised to make the boy love her, but the devil manipulated her into accusing her brother of rape. Their father had the brother torn apart by dogs as punishment. Before he died, however, he prophesied that his sister would give birth to an abomination that would make the same sounds as the pack of dogs that were about to kill him. Later in the Post-Vulgate, the Prose Tristan, and the sections of Malory based on those works, Saracen knight Palamedes hunts the Questing Beast. It is a futile venture, much like his love for Tristan's paramour Iseult, offering him nothing but hardship. In the Post-Vulgate, his conversion to Christianity allows him relief from his endless worldly pursuits, and he finally slays the creature during the Grail Quest after he, Percival, and Galahad have chased it into a lake. The Perlesvaus offers an entirely different depiction of the Questing Beast than the best known one, given above. There, it is described as pure white, smaller than a fox, and beautiful to look at. The noise from its belly is the sound of its offspring who tear the creature apart from the inside; the author takes the beast as a symbol of Christ, destroyed by the followers of the Old Law, the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Gerbert de Montreuil provides a similar vision of the Questing Beast in his Continuation of Perceval, the Story of the Grail, though he says that it is \\"wondrously large\\" and interprets the noise and subsequent gruesome death by its own offspring as a symbol of impious churchgoers who disturb the sanctity of Mass by talking. The Questing Beast appears in many later works as well, including stories written in French, Galician, Spanish, and Italian. Modern versions * T. H. White re-envisions the Questing Beast's role in his novel The Once and Future King. As King Pellinore describes it, the hunt of the beast has always been the burden of the Pellinores, and all Pellinores are in fact trained for the hunt from birth‚Äîa training which does not seem to extend much beyond finding the beast's fewmets. (Pellinore is more of a comic character as described by White than a great hunter or knight.) Having searched fruitlessly all his life for the beast, Pellinore is convinced by his friend Sir Grummore Grummursum to drop his quest. However, it turns out later that the beast is pining away for lack of attention, so King Pellinore nurses it back to health and resumes his Sisyphean hunt. This account also appears in slightly different form in the original version of The Sword in the Stone. There, King Pellinore is imprisoned by Galapas the giant, but he is saved by the Beast who turns up to rescue him--as well as Merlin and Arthur, who happen to be there at the time. Galapas ends up barricaded in his topmost tower, shrieking \\"let go of me you awful animal\\", and shouting to be rescued by the Fire Brigade. Later, the Beast falls in love with Sir Palomides, who briefly disguised himself and Sir Grummore as the beast herself in order to raise Pellinore's spirits when he is pining for his lover. White explains that this is why it is Palomides who is seen pursuing the beast later in Malory's work. * A 1967 television episode of Lost in Space features the Questing Beast pursued by Sir Sagramonte. * The Questing Beast appears in \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", the season finale of Season 1 of the BBC's series Merlin. * The Questing Beast also appears in the Thursday Next novel series by Jasper Fforde, although it is not described. Here it is also hunted by King Pellinore as part of his family's tradition and burden. * A Questing Beast appears in the novel and subsequent TV series The Magicians, but this beast is instead a reference to the White Stag from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. * The Arthurian-inspired Magic: The Gathering set Throne of Eldraine features a card named Questing Beast, based on the legend of the same name.

A fragmented part of the 'window' spectrum (one might say a louvred part of the 'window') can also be seen in the visible to mid-wavelength infrared between 0.2 and 5.5 Œºm. The infrared atmospheric window refers to a region of the Infrared spectrum where there is relatively little absorption of terrestrial thermal radiation by atmospheric gases. The window plays an important role in the atmospheric greenhouse effect by maintaining the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing IR to space. In the earth's atmosphere this window is roughly the region between 8 and 14 Œºm although it can be narrowed or closed at times and places of high humidity because of the strong absorption in the water vapor continuum or because of blocking by clouds. It covers a substantial part of the spectrum from surface thermal emission which starts at roughly 5 Œºm. Principally it is a large gap in the absorption spectrum of water vapor. Carbon dioxide plays an important role in setting the boundary at the long wavelength end. Ozone partly blocks transmission in the middle of the window. The importance of the infrared atmospheric window in the atmospheric energy balance was discovered by George Simpson in 1928, based on G. Hettner's 1918 laboratory studies of the gap in the absorption spectrum of water vapor. In those days, computers were not available, and Simpson notes that he used approximations; he writes about the need for this in order to calculate outgoing IR radiation: \\"There is no hope of getting an exact solution; but by making suitable simplifying assumptions . . . .\\" Nowadays, accurate line-by- line computations are possible, and careful studies of the spectroscopy of infrared atmospheric gases have been published.  Mechanisms in the infrared atmospheric window  The principal natural greenhouse gases in order of their importance are water vapor , carbon dioxide , ozone , methane and nitrous oxide . The concentration of the least common of these, , is about 400 ppbV. Other gases which contribute to the greenhouse effect are present at pptV levels. These include the chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluororcarbons (HFC and HCFCs). As discussed below, a major reason that they are so effective as greenhouse gases is that they have strong vibrational bands that fall in the infrared atmospheric window. IR absorption by at 14.7 Œºm sets the long wavelength limit of the infrared atmospheric window together with absorption by rotational transitions of at slightly longer wavelengths. The short wavelength boundary of the atmospheric IR window is set by absorption in the lowest frequency vibrational bands of water vapor. There is a strong band of ozone at 9.6 Œºm in the middle of the window which is why it acts as such a strong greenhouse gas. Water vapor has a continuum absorption due to collisional broadening of absorption lines which extends through the window. Local very high humidity can completely block the infrared vibrational window. Over the Atlas Mountains, interferometrically recorded spectra of outgoing longwave radiation show emission that has arisen from the land surface at a temperature of about 320 K and passed through the atmospheric window, and non- window emission that has arisen mainly from the troposphere at temperatures about 260 K. Over C√¥te d'Ivoire, interferometrically recorded spectra of outgoing longwave radiation show emission that has arisen from the cloud tops at a temperature of about 265 K and passed through the atmospheric window, and non-window emission that has arisen mainly from the troposphere at temperatures about 240 K. This means that, at the scarcely absorbed continuum of wavelengths (8 to 14 Œºm), the radiation emitted, by the earth's surface into a dry atmosphere, and by the cloud tops, mostly passes unabsorbed through the atmosphere, and is emitted directly to space; there is also partial window transmission in far infrared spectral lines between about 16 and 28 Œºm. Clouds are excellent emitters of infrared radiation. Window radiation from cloud tops arises at altitudes where the air temperature is low, but as seen from those altitudes, the water vapor content of the air above is much lower than that of the air at the land-sea surface. Moreover, the water vapour continuum absorptivity, molecule for molecule, decreases with pressure decrease. Thus water vapour above the clouds, besides being less concentrated, is also less absorptive than water vapour at lower altitudes. Consequently, the effective window as seen from the cloud-top altitudes is more open, with the result that the cloud tops are effectively strong sources of window radiation; that is to say, in effect the clouds obstruct the window only to a small degree (see another opinion about this, proposed by Ahrens (2009) on page 43). Importance for life Without the infrared atmospheric window, the Earth would become much too warm to support life, and possibly so warm that it would lose its water, as Venus did early in solar system history. Thus, the existence of an atmospheric window is critical to Earth remaining a habitable planet. Threats In recent decades, the existence of the infrared atmospheric window has become threatened by the development of highly unreactive gases containing bonds between fluorine and carbon, sulfur or nitrogen. The impact of these compounds was first discovered by Indian‚ÄìAmerican atmospheric scientist Veerabhadran Ramanathan in 1975,Ramanathan, Veerabhadran; 'Greenhouse Effect Due to Chlorofluorocarbons: Climatic Implications'; Science, vol. 190, no. 4209 (October 3, 1975), pp. 50‚Äì52 one year after Roland and Molina's much-more-celebrated paper on the ability of chlorofluorocarbons to destroy stratospheric ozone. The \\"stretching frequencies\\" of bonds between fluorine and other light nonmetals are such that strong absorption in the atmospheric window will always be characteristic of compounds containing such bonds,Bera, Partha P.; Francisco, Joseph S. and Lee, Timothy J.; 'Identifying the Molecular Origin of Global Warming'; Journal of Physical Chemistry; 113 (2009), pp. 12694-12699 although fluorides of nonmetals other than carbon, nitrogen or sulfur are short-lived due to hydrolysis. This absorption is strengthened because these bonds are highly polar due to the extreme electronegativity of the fluorine atom. Bonds to other halogens also absorb in the atmospheric window, though much less strongly. Moreover, the unreactive nature of such compounds that makes them so valuable for many industrial purposes means that they are not removable in the natural circulation of the Earth's lower atmosphere. Extremely small natural sources created by means of radioactive oxidation of fluorite and subsequent reaction with sulfate or carbonate minerals produce via degassing atmospheric concentrations of about 40 ppt for all perfluorocarbons and 0.01 ppt for sulfur hexafluoride,Harnisch, J. and Eisenhauer, A.: 'Natural CF4 and SF6 on Earth', Geophysical Research Letters, vol. 25 (1998), pp. 2401‚Äì2404 but the only natural ceiling is via photolysis in the mesosphere and upper stratosphere.Kov√°cs, Tam√°s; Wuhu Feng; Totterdill, Anna; Plane, John M.C.; Dhomse, Sandip; G√≥mez-Mart√≠n, Juan Carlos; Stiller, Gabriele P.; Haenel, Florian J.; Smith, Christopher; Forster, Piers M.; Garc√≠a, Rolando R.; Marsh, Daniel R. and Chipperfield, Martyn P.; 'Determination of the atmospheric lifetime and global warming potential of sulfur hexafluoride using a three- dimensional model' It is estimated, for instance, that perfluorocarbons (, , ) can stay in the atmosphere for between two thousand six hundred and fifty thousand years.Midgeley, P.M. and McCulloch, A.; Properties and Applications of Industrial Halocarbons, in Fabian, Peter and Singh, Onkar N. (editors); Reactive Halogen Compounds in the Atmosphere, Volume 4, p. 134 This means that such compounds have an enormous global warming potential. One kilogram of sulfur hexafluoride will, for example, cause as much warming as 23 tonnes of carbon dioxide over 100 years. Perfluorocarbons are similar in this respect, and even carbon tetrachloride () has a global warming potential of 1800 compared to carbon dioxide. Efforts to find substitutes for these compounds are still going on and they remain highly problematic.

Notable appearances and recordings  A version of the song was used as the closing theme of Lamb Chop's Play-Along, a 1992 televised puppet show on PBS. At the end of each episode, the puppets sang the verses of the song while hostess Shari Lewis would try in vain to stop them. They would eventually leave (on her urging), even while beginning a sixth verse (which eventually fades away). Then the puppet character Charlie Horse would return and try to get to sing the song again. But Shari, however, stops him successfully by covering his mouth (keeping him from singing it again, before he tries to get to sing it) and orders him to \\"go away\\". Charlie Horse does leave but slams the door before Shari could tell him not to slam the door. After the door is slammed, she faces the audience with an exasperated expression and says \\"door\\". But it at least is now in peace and quiet with Charlie, Lamb Chop, and the group gone. A short rendition of the song appeared in a skit on the animated TV show Cartoon Planet (the skit is also featured on the companion album, Space Ghost's Musical Bar-B-Que). Brak sings the song until he is asked to stop by Zorak, who finds it annoying. Brak explains that he is unable to because it's the \\"song that doesn't end.\\" He attempts to continue until Zorak loses his temper, causing Brak to cease, remarking, \\"I guess it just ended.\\" The song has been adopted as an unofficial anthem by disparate groups. The Discordian organization (or disorganization) known as POEE has listed the song in their material with claims that it was written by a member, while fans of the rock band Styx adopted a variation, \\"The Tour That Never Ends\\", to describe Styx's 400-plus date tour in the late 1990s in support of their album Brave New World.

Players/teams are \\"planted\\" into the bracket in a manner that is typically intended so that the best do not meet until later in the competition. The term was first used in tennis,Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (2002), Fifth Edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, Page 2737, and is based on the idea of laying out a tournament ladder by arranging slips of paper with the names of players on them the way seeds or seedlings are arranged in a garden: smaller plants up front, larger ones behind. Sometimes the remaining competitors in a single- elimination tournament will be \\"re-seeded\\" so that the highest surviving seed is made to play the lowest surviving seed in the next round, the second- highest plays the second-lowest, etc. This may be done after each round, or only at selected intervals. Tennis Professional tennis tournaments seed players based on their rankings. The number of seeds varies from tournament to tournament. Generally the bigger the event the more seeds there tend to be relative to lesser events. The 4 major (Grand Slam) tournaments progressively expanded from 8-seed format to 16-seed, then to the current 32-seed format, which was adopted in the middle of the 2001 season, after French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten had complained that clay-court specialists were at a disadvantage with just 16 seeds. In a tennis event, one version of seeding is where brackets are set up so that the quarterfinal pairings (barring any upsets) would be the 1 seed vs. the 8 seed, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 6 and 4 vs. 5; however, this is not the procedure that is followed in most tennis tournaments, where the 1 and 2 seeds are placed in separate brackets, but then the 3 and 4 seeds are assigned to their brackets randomly, and so too are seeds 5 through 8, and so on. This may result in some brackets consisting of stronger players than other brackets, and since only the top 32 players are seeded in Tennis Grand Slam tournaments, it is conceivable that the 33rd best player in a 128-player field could end up playing the top seed in the first round. A good example of this occurring was when World No. 33 Florian Mayer was drawn against (and eventually defeated by) then-World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first round of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships,Wimbledon: Novak vs Mayer in R1; Andy, Roger, Rafa all in bottom half, Novak Djokovic official website, 21 June 2013 in what was also a rematch of a quarter-final from the previous year.Wimbledon 2013: Men's matches to watch out for, The Roar, 22 June 2013 Rankings of tennis players, based on a history of performance, tend to change positions gradually, and so a more \\"equitable\\" method of determining the pairings might result in many of the same head-to-head match-ups being repeated in successive tournaments. An example of a seeded 16-team bracket (note that in each round in this example, adding the \\"seed\\" numbers in each match results in the same number for each match): Other sports In American team sports, the NFL playoffs and WNBA playoffs employ re-seeding, the NBA playoffs and the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament do not, the Stanley Cup Playoffs used re-seeding between 1994 and 2013, the MLS Cup Playoffs used reseeding until 2018, and the MLB postseason does not have enough teams where re-seeding would make a difference in the matchups. In some situations, a seeding restriction will be implemented; from 1975 until 1989 in the NFL and from 1998 until 2011 in MLB there was a rule where in the first round should the top seed and wild card be from the same division, they would not play each other; in those cases, the top seed played the third seed and the second seed played the wild card team. = Association Football = Seeding in major tournaments is commonplace. The FIFA World Cup has employed seeding since it was first established in 1930. The seedings for the World Cup are based on the World Football Elo Ratings produced by FIFA. The seeding for the UEFA European Championship (for nations) and the UEFA Champions League (for clubs) is based on the UEFA coefficient, a ranking system based on the performance of both national teams and individual clubs in European tournaments over a five year period.

Equinox, 2011 803-805 An aniconic culture, the Nabataean representation of deities lacked figural imagery. Related to betyls, nepheshes served as aniconic memorial markers for the dead. Unlike the Israelite prohibition of the graven image, Nabataean aniconism allows anthropomorphic representation of deities but demonstrates a preference for non- figural imagery. Betyls are one form of Nabataean aniconic sculpture. Often explained as representations of Dushara, the central Nabataean deity, betyls occur in a wide variety of shapes, groupings, and niches. This variety suggests that betyls may be representative of other deities as well.Robert Wenning, ‚ÄúThe Betyls of Petra,‚ÄùBulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No.324.

Roughly carved or engraved in bas-relief, these structures are often set upon a base that bears the name of the deceased.

The film co-stars Jan Sterling and features Robert Arthur and Porter Hall. It marked a series of firsts for auteur Billy Wilder: it was the first time he was involved in a project as a writer, producer, and director; his first film following his breakup with long-time writing partner Charles Brackett, with whom he had collaborated on The Lost Weekend and Sunset Boulevard, among others; and his first film to be a critical and commercial failure. The story is a biting examination of the seedy relationship between the press, the news it reports and the manner in which it reports it. The film also shows how a gullible public can be manipulated by the press. Without consulting Wilder, Paramount Pictures executive Y. Frank Freeman changed the title to The Big Carnival just prior to its release.\\"Notes\\" TCM.com Early television broadcasts retained that title, but when aired by Turner Classic Movies - and when released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in July 2007 - it reverted to Ace in the Hole. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a fiercely ambitious, self-centered, newly sober reporter whose career has fallen into notoriety and decline. He has come west to New Mexico from New York City in a broken-down car, out of money and options. The charismatic Tatum talks his way into a reporting job with Boot (Porter Hall), the publisher for the tiny Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin. Tatum asks if Mr. Boot would like to make $200 a week, saying \\"Mr. Boot, I'm a 250 dollar a week newspaperman. I can be had for $50.\\" Boot says, \\"In this shop we pay $60 a week\\" and brings Tatum on. However, he remains skeptical of his new hire. Tatum stays sober and works there uneventfully for a year. Then while unhappily on assignment to cover a rattlesnake hunt, he learns about Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict), a local man who has become trapped in a cave collapse while gathering ancient Indian artifacts. Sensing a golden opportunity, Tatum manipulates the rescue effort, forming an alliance with Kretzer, an unscrupulous sheriff, by depicting him favorably in the newspaper to ensure Kretzer's re-election. The pair coerce the construction contractor charged with the rescue into drilling from above, rather than the quicker method of shoring up the existing passages, so that Tatum can prolong his own stay on the front pages of newspapers nationwide. Tatum also directs Kretzer to prevent any other reporters from encroaching on the story, keeping it as his exclusive. Lorraine (Jan Sterling), the victim's wife, goes along with the reporter's scheme. She is eager to leave Leo and their struggling business, a combination trading post and restaurant in the middle of nowhere. Thanks to the publicity Tatum generates, she experiences a financial windfall, particularly from thousands of tourists who come to witness the rescue. Herbie Cook (Robert Arthur), the newspaper's young photographer initially on assignment with Leo, slowly loses his idealism as he follows Tatum's lead and envisions himself selling pictures to Look or Life. Boot makes a surprise visit to Tatum and tries to talk some sense into him and Herbie but is rebuffed by Tatum, who quits on the spot, having sold the exclusive rights to his copy to a New York editor for $1000 per day and, more importantly, his old job back. Thousands flock to the town. The rescue site literally becomes an all-day carnival with rides, entertainment, games and songs about Leo. Tatum sets up shop at the trading post and begins drinking again. He takes up with Lorraine and is greeted heroically by the crowd each time he returns from visiting Leo in the cave. After five days of drilling, things get worse. A visiting doctor diagnoses Leo with a grim bout of pneumonia. His only chance for survival is by being rescued in 12 hours. Remorseful, Tatum sends a news flash, saying that Leo will now be rescued by shoring up the cave walls during the 12-hour period. But when he speaks to the contractor, he learns that the vibration from drilling has made this impossible. Tatum's mistreatment of Lorraine reaches its boiling point with his physical and mental abuse, leading her to stab him in self-defense with a pair of scissors, mortally wounding him. Tatum gets the local priest, and takes him into the cave to administer the Last Rites. Leo subsequently dies and Tatum, guilt ridden over what's transpired, orders the crew to stop drilling. Tatum announces to the crowd that Leo has died, telling them to pack up and leave. Subsequently, many of the reporters that have come to the town, former colleagues with contempt for Tatum already, immediately get on their newswires and report Leo's death. As the carnival breaks down, the public packs up and moves out en masse, Lorraine is amongst the departing as she misses her bus and tries hitching a ride with one of the passing cars. Tatum has neglected to send copy to the New York editor, who is furious that other newspapers have hit the streets with the news about Leo's death. Tatum is fired and the rival reporters come to Tatum's room to gloat before he kicks them out. Drunk and dying, Tatum calls the editor and tries to confess to killing Leo by delaying the rescue, but the editor hangs up on him. Tatum corrals Herbie into leaving immediately in their car and they barely reach the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin. Tatum makes a dramatic entrance into the paper's offices, calling for Boot. Tatum asks him \\"How'd you like to make yourself a thousand dollars a day, Mr. Boot? I'm a thousand dollar a day newspaperman. You can have me for nothin'.\\" Tatum then falls dead to the floor.

The first involved W. Floyd Collins, who in 1925 was trapped inside Sand Cave, Kentucky, following a landslide. A Louisville newspaper, the Courier-Journal, jumped on the story by dispatching reporter William Burke Miller to the scene. Miller's enterprising coverage turned the tragic episode into a national event and earned the writer a Pulitzer Prize. Collins's name is cited in the film as an example of a cave-in victim who becomes a media sensation. The second event took place in April 1949. Three-year-old Kathy Fiscus of San Marino, California, fell into an abandoned well and, during a rescue operation that lasted several days, thousands of people arrived to watch the action unfold. In both cases, the victims died before they were rescued. After the film's release screenwriter Victor Desny sued Wilder for plagiarism because he had contacted Wilder's secretary Rosella Stewart to propose a film based on the story of Floyd Collins in November 1949. Wilder's attorneys responded that not only did an oral plot summary not constitute a formal story submission but the Collins case was historical in nature and as such was not protected by copyright laws. In December 1953, Judge Stanley Mosk ruled in favor of Wilder and Paramount. Desny appealed and in August 1956 the California Supreme Court ruled his oral submission had been legitimate. Wilder's attorneys settled that same month, paying Desny $14,350 (). =Writing= In the original script, Tatum colluded with the local sheriff. Joseph Breen of the Hays Code office strongly objected to the on-screen depiction of a corrupt law enforcement officer and insisted Wilder add dialogue making it clear the man eventually would be made to answer for his actions. =Filming= The final cost of the film was $1,821,052, of which $250,000 was paid to Wilder as writer, producer, and director. Its exterior set, (), which was constructed 19 miles west of Gallup, was the largest non-combat set ever constructed at the time. It measured high, wide, and deep and included an ancient cliff dwelling, collapsed cave, roadside stands, parking lots, and a carnival site. Underground scenes were filmed in a mock-up at the Paramount Studios on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. More than 1,000 extras and 400 cars were utilized in the crowd scenes. After the film was completed, Paramount charged admission to the set. Frank Cady's character identifies himself as a salesman for Pacific All-Risk Insurance, a fictitious company featured in Wilder's 1944 film Double Indemnity. =Soundtrack= Jay Livingston and Ray Evans wrote the song \\"We're Coming, Leo,\\" performed by a vocalist and band at the carnival. Reception Alternate poster with the title The Big Carnival =Critical response= At the time of its release, critics found little to admire. In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called it \\"a masterly film\\" but added, \\"Mr. Wilder has let imagination so fully take command of his yarn that it presents not only a distortion of journalistic practice but something of a dramatic grotesque . . . [it] is badly weakened by a poorly constructed plot, which depends for its strength upon assumptions that are not only na√Øve but absurd. There isn't any denying that there are vicious newspaper men and that one might conceivably take advantage of a disaster for his own private gain. But to reckon that one could so tie up and maneuver a story of any size, while other reporters chew their fingers, is simply incredible.\\" The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"ruthless and cynical...a distorted study of corruption and mob psychology that...is nothing more than a brazen, uncalled-for slap in the face of two respected and frequently effective American institutions - democratic government and the free press.\\" Variety was more positive, noting \\"the performances are fine. Douglas enacts the heel reporter ably, giving it color to balance its unsympathetic character. Jan Sterling also is good in a role that has no softening touches, and Benedict's victim portrayal is first- rate. Billy Wilder's direction captures the feel of morbid expectancy that always comes out in the curious that flock to scenes of tragedy.\\" The film has found new respect among critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote in 2007, \\"Although the film is 56 years old, I found while watching it again that it still has all its power. It hasn't aged because Wilder and his co-writers, Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels, were so lean and mean [with their dialogue] . . . [Kirk Douglas'] focus and energy . . . is almost scary. There is nothing dated about [his] performance. It's as right-now as a sharpened knife.\\" Dave Kehr in the Chicago Reader called it \\"cold, lurid, and fascinating\\" and Nathan Lee of The Village Voice wrote, \\"Here is, half a century out of the past, a movie so acidly au courant it stings.\\" Time Out London wrote, \\"As a diatribe against all that is worst in human nature, it has moments dipped in pure vitriol.\\" TV Guide called it \\"a searing example of writer-director Billy Wilder at his most brilliantly misanthropic\\" and adds, \\"An uncompromising portrait of human nature at its worst, the film . . . stands as one of the great American films of the 1950s.\\" Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wrote that the film \\"... allowed Wilder to question the very nature of human interest stories and the twisted relationship between the American media and its public. More than 50 years after the film's release, when magazines compete to come up with the cattiest buzz terms and giddily celebrate the demise of celebrity relationships for buffo bucks, Ace in the Hole feels more relevant than ever.\\" In his Slate review, Jack Shafer wrote in 2007, \\"If film noir illustrates the crackup of the American dream . . . Ace in the Hole is an exemplar of the form.\\" In September 2008, Empire Magazine published its list of the Top 500 greatest movies of all time. With votes from 10,000 readers of the magazine along with 500 key film critics and 150 film industry figures, this film is ranked number 385.Staff \\"Empire Magazine's The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\\" Empire Retrieved March 21, 2013.

The company was founded in Braintree, Massachusetts by Dr. Jack Latham in the 1970s. Today, the company has expanded and has offices located in 16 countries. The company employs more than 1,800 people and markets its products in over 50 countries. Revenue is derived nearly equally from its three major markets -- Asia, Europe, and the Americas. History The company was founded in 1971. Haemonetics started out producing the containers and bags required for blood collection. The Latham Bowl was a disposable container that could automate the separation of blood by centrifugation. Through the 90's, the company added additional product lines and technologies. The company opened a manufacturing facility in Holbrook, Massachusetts in 1988. In 1995 the company purchased the Intravenous Solutions manufacturing facility in Union, South Carolina. Addition acquisitions grew the company and expanded its services. In the following years the company branched off to making the whole plasma collection station including the machine, supplies and software for plasma collection. These acquisitions included Edmonton-based Fifth Dimension (5D) Information Systems to gain entry into the blood and plasma software industry. Further acquisitions include Chicago-based Arryx in July 2006, Information Data Management, Inc. in January 2007, the acquisition of a division of Haemoscope in 2007, the acquisition of Infonale in July 2007, and, in 2009, Chico, California-based Altivation and Tucson, Arizona-based Sebra. On August 21, 2007, 5D and IDM were officially merged into a new subsidiary called Haemonetics Software Solutions. The employees at both Edmonton (5D) and Rosemont (IDM) continue to work from their respective offices. Further acquisitions included the April 2009 acquisition of Neoteric Technology Ltd and the April 2010 acquisition of California-based Global Med Technologies, Inc.

In 1864, he led an unsuccessful raid on the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia and was killed. The failed raid resulted in the Dahlgren Affair after incriminating documents were discovered on Dahlgren's corpse. Early life Ulric Dahlgren was born April 3, 1842, to Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren and Mary Clement Bunker.Dahlgren p. 11 Ulric Dahlgren A second son to his parents, Dahlgren was born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Incidentally, his uncle, Charles G. Dahlgren, settled in Mississippi and would eventually join the Confederate Army as a general when the Civil War broke out. After completing school in 1858, Dahlgren's father supplied him with instruction in the field of civil engineering and by 1859, he was busy surveying land in Mississippi. In September 1860, with the support of his father, he ventured to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he found work at a law office. American Civil War Following the inauguration of the 16th U.S. President, Abraham Lincoln, in March 1861, Dahlgren entered military service and thus before July 24, 1861, he joined the U.S. Navy since on that date he was on a U.S. Navy expedition from the Washington Ship Yard to help in the defense of Alexandria, Virginia. On May 29, 1862, Dahlgren was transferred from the U.S. Navy to the U.S. Army and promoted to captain by the U.S. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton who quickly recognized his gunnery talent while at Harpers Ferry. He was active on behalf of the U.S. Army at the Second Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Fredericksburg both in 1862 and at the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Brandy Station, as well as the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Wounded on July 6, 1863, while trying to reach Hagerstown, Maryland, he had to have his foot amputated. For these efforts, the Dahlgren received a Commission as a colonel on July 24, 1863. With his wound sufficiently healed, he returned to the battlefield on February 18, 1864, under the command of Brig. Gen. Hugh Judson Kilpatrick in time for a so- called \\"Kilpatrick Raid\\" upon the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia where he was killed in action. He was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. Papers found on Dahlgren's corpse shortly after his death contained orders for an assassination plot against Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The discovery and publication of the Dahlgren Papers sparked controversy in the South. The disrespectful display of Dahlgren's corpse in Richmond inflamed Northern public opinion, until the intervention of Elizabeth Van Lew enabled his burial, at considerable risk to the Union spy network she ran in the Confederate capital. The papers may have contributed to John Wilkes Booth's decision to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln a year later. See also *Dahlgren Affair *John A.

As far back as 1628 and 1633 respectively, both William Harvey and Ren√© Descartes speculated that somewhere within the body, in a special locality, there was a ‚Äòvital spirit‚Äô or 'vital force', which animated the whole bodily frame, such as the engine in a factory moves the machinery in it. Spirit has frequently been conceived of as a supernatural being, or non- physical entity; for example, a demon, ghost, fairy, or angel. In ancient Islamic terminology however, a spirit (r≈´·∏•), applies only to pure spirits, but not to other invisible creatures, such as jinn, demons and angels.Chodkiewicz, M., ‚ÄúR≈´·∏•ƒÅniyya‚Äù, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P.

In English Bibles, \\"the Spirit\\" (with a capital \\"S\\"), specifically denotes the Holy Spirit.

(Note, however, that in Semitic just as in Indo-European, this dichotomy has not always been as neat historically as it has come to be taken over a long period of development: Both (root ) and (root ), as well as cognate words in various Semitic languages, including Arabic, also preserve meanings involving miscellaneous air phenomena: \\"breath\\", \\"wind\\", and even \\"odour\\".Koehler, L., Baumgartner, W., Richardson, M.

Usage  \\"Spirit\\" has acquired a number of meanings: * Christian theology can use the term \\"Spirit\\" to describe the Holy Spirit. ** Christian Science uses \\"Spirit\\" as one of seven synonyms for God, as in: \\"Principle; Mind; Soul; Spirit; Life; Truth; Love\\" ** Latter Day Saint prophet Joseph Smith Jr. taught that the concept of spirit as incorporeal or without substance was incorrect: \\"There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 131:7 Regarding the soul, Joseph Smith wrote \\"And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his spirit (that is, the man‚Äôs spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\\" Thus, the soul is the combination of a spirit with a body (although most members use \\"soul\\" and \\"spirit\\" interchangeably). In Mormon scripture, spirits are sometimes referred to as \\"intelligences\\". But other Mormon scriptures teach that God organized the spirits out of a pre-existing substance called \\"intelligence\\" or \\"the light of truth\\". While this may seem confusing, it can be compared to how a programmer writes an algorithm by organizing lines of logical code. The logic always existed, independent of the programmer, but it is the creator who organizes it into a living spirit / intelligence / soul. * Various forms of animism, such as Japan's Shinto and African traditional religion, focus on invisible beings that represent or connect with plants, animals, or landforms (kami): translators usually employ the English word \\"spirit\\" when trying to express the idea of such entities. * According to C. G. Jung (in a lecture delivered to the literary Society of Augsburg, 20 October 1926, on the theme of ‚ÄúNature and Spirit‚Äù): * Psychical research, \\"In all the publications of the Society for Psychical Research the term ‚Äòspirit‚Äô stands for the personal stream of consciousness whatever else it may ultimately be proved to imply or require\\" (James H. Hyslop, 1919). Related concepts Similar concepts in other languages include Greek pneuma, Chinese Ling and hun (ÈùàÈ≠Ç) and Sanskrit akasha / atman (see also prana). Some languages use a word for spirit often closely related (if not synonymous) to mind. Examples include the German Geist (related to the English word ghost) or the French l'esprit. English versions of the Bible most commonly translate the Hebrew word ruach (◊®◊ï◊ó; wind) as \\"the spirit\\", whose essence is divine. Alternatively, Hebrew texts commonly use the word nephesh. Kabbalists regard nephesh as one of the five parts of the Jewish soul, where nephesh (animal) refers to the physical being and its animal instincts. Similarly, Scandinavian, Baltic, and Slavic languages, as well as Chinese (Ê∞î qi), use the words for breath to express concepts similar to \\"the spirit\\".

The title is Latin for \\"Our Passover,\\" and the text consists of the words of several verses of Scripture: 1 Corinthians 5:7‚Äì8, Romans 6:9‚Äì11, and 1 Corinthians 15:20‚Äì22. The Latin text is: Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus, alleluia: itaque epulemur in azymis sinceritatis et veritatis, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. After the Reformation it was preserved (in an English translation) in the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer, appointed to be said in place of the Venite at Morning Prayer on Easter Day. In some churches it may be used in place of the Gloria in Excelsis during the Easter season, especially at the Easter Vigil. It has been put to many different musical settings. In some Anglican churches, the first verse of it is used as a Fraction Anthem. In the Catholic Church, in masses celebrated according to Divine Worship: The Missal, the first verse is said or sung responsively by the priest and congregation after the sign of peace as the priest breaks the host. It is followed by the comixture and the singing of the Agnus Dei. The words in English, as printed in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church, are as follows:Book of Common Prayer, p. 83 > Alleluia. > Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; > therefore let us keep the feast, Not with the old leaven, the leaven of > malice and evil, > but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

It was used as the emblem and coat of arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from the 1280s. There are variants to the design, also known as \\"Jerusalem cross\\", with either the four crosslets also in the form of Crosses potent, or conversely with the central cross, also in the form of a plain Greek cross.The design with the crosslets as crosses potent is medieval, e.g. found in 13th-century stonework in the Nor Varagavank monastery, Armenia (image); another example is found in the Norman church at Bozeat, Northamptonshire, England (image).

Godfrey of Bouillon as depicted in a late medieval fresco (Castello della Manta, Piedmont, Italy, c. 1420.) While the symbol of the five-fold cross appears to originate in the 11th century, its association with the Kingdom of Jerusalem dates to the second half of the 13th century. The symbolism of the five-fold cross is variously given as the Five Wounds of Christ, Christ and the four evangelists, or Christ and the four quarters of the world. The symbolism of five crosses representing the Five Wounds is first recorded in the context of the consecration of the St Brelade's Church under the patronage of Robert of Normandy (before 1035); the crosses are incised in the church's altar stone. The \\"cross-and-crosslets\\" or Tealby pennies minted under Henry II of England during 1158-1180 have the \\"Jerusalem cross\\" on the obverse, with the four crosslets depicted as decussate (diagonal).T.C.R.

It was not used, however, by the Christian rulers of Jerusalem during the 12th century. A simple blazon of or, a cross argent is documented by Matthew Paris as the arms of John de Brienne, who had been king of Jerusalem during 1210-1212, upon John's death in 1237. The emblem used on the seals of the rulers of Jerusalem during the 12th century was a simplified depiction of the city itself, showing the tower of David between the Dome of the Rock and the Holy Sepulchre, surrounded by the city walls. Coins minted under Henry I (r. 1192-1197) show a cross with four dots in the four quarters, but the Jerusalem cross proper appears only on a coin minted under John II (r. 1284/5).Hubert de Vries, Jerusalem (hubert-herald.nl). The design is also found on coins minted under his successor, the last king of Jerusalem, Henry II (forumancientcoins.com) At about the same time, the cross of Jerusalem in gold on a silver field appears as the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in early armorials such as the Camden Roll. The arms of the King of Jerusalem featured gold on silver (in the case of John de Brienne, silver on gold), a metal on a metal, and thus broke the heraldic Rule of Tincture; this was justified by the fact that Jerusalem was so holy, it was above ordinary rules. The gold and silver were also connected to Psalms 68:13, which mentions a \\"dove covered in silver, and her feathers with yellow gold\\". The Gelre Armorial (14th century) attributes to the \\"emperors of Constantinople\\" (the Latin Empire) a variant of the Jerusalem cross with the four crosslets inscribed in circles.No.1484.

Philip of Courtenay, who held the title of Latin Emperor of Constantinople from 1273-1283 (even though Constantinople had been reinstated to the Byzantine Empire in 1261) used an extended form of the Jerusalem cross, where each of the four crosslets was itself surrounded by four smaller crosslets (a \\"Jerusalem cross of Jerusalem crosses\\").Hubert de Vries, Byzantium: Arms and Emblems (hubert-herald.nl) (2011). Classical heraldry The Jerusalem cross on a 1556 Testoon of Mary, Queen of Scots. In late medieval heraldry the Crusader's cross was used for various Crusader states. The 14th-century Book of All Kingdoms uses it as the flag of Sebasteia. At about the same time, the Pizzigano chart uses it as the flag of Tbilisi (based on the latter example, the Crusader's cross was adopted as the flag of Georgia in 2004). Carlo Maggi, a Venetian nobleman who visited Jerusalem and was made a knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in the early 1570s, included the Jerusalem cross in his coat of arms. There is a historiographical tradition that Peter the Great flew a flag with a variant of the Jerusalem cross in his campaign in the White Sea in 1693.This is apparently reported in an 1829 vexillological publication (–°–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ —à—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–≤, —Ñ–ª–∞–≥–æ–≤ –∏ –≤—ã–º–ø–µ–ª–æ–≤, —É–ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–ª—è–µ–º—ã—Ö –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏ (\\"Collection of banners, flags and pennants, used in the Russian Empire\\", St. Petersburg, 1829, reprinted 1833 (facsimile); the historicity of this is doubtful, c.f.

Modern use A banner with a variation of the Jerusalem cross was used at the proclamation of the Revolution on Mount Pelion Anthimos Gazis in May 1821 in the Greek War of Independence. The papal Order of the Holy Sepulchre uses the Jerusalem cross as its emblem, in red, which is also used in the arms of the Custodian of the Holy Land, head of the Franciscan friars who serve at the holy Christian sites in Jerusalem, and whose work is supported by the Order.

German Emperor Wilhelm II visited Jerusalem in 1898 and awarded the Jerusalem-Erinnerungskreuz (Jerusalem Memorial Cross) order in the shape of a Jerusalem cross to those who accompanied him at the inauguration of the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer, Jerusalem. In the early 20th century, the Jerusalem cross also came to be used as a symbol of world evangelisation in Protestantism.

Upon completion of the most recent renovations, the Portland Art Museum became one of the 25 largest art museums in the US, at a total of 240,000 square feet (22,000 m¬≤), with more than 112,000 square feet (10,400 m¬≤) of gallery space. The permanent collection has more than 42,000 works of art, and at least one major traveling exhibition is usually on show. The Portland Art Museum features a center for Native American art, a center for Northwest art, a center for modern and contemporary art, permanent exhibitions of Asian art, and an outdoor public sculpture garden. The Northwest Film Center is also a component of Portland Art Museum. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, with accreditation through 2024.List of Accredited Museums. American Alliance of Museums. Retrieved December 13, 2007. Founding Originally incorporated as the Portland Art Association, the museum's roots date to 1892. Late that year seven prominent business and cultural leaders in the city created the association so as to start a high- quality art museum for a city approaching 50,000 residents. Henry Corbett donated $10,000 to the association that funded the museum's first collection (the Corbett Collection), which consisted of one hundred plaster casts of Greek and Roman sculptures. The individual pieces of the collection were selected by Winslow B. Ayer and his wife during a trip to Europe. They had been advised by curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston prior to the trip on what pieces to select. The collection was originally displayed at the Multnomah County Library located at Southwest Seventh and Stark streets in Downtown. Early history By the time of the Lewis & Clark Exposition held in Portland in 1905, the Portland Art Museum had outgrown its location in the public library and had moved into its own building at SW 5th and Taylor. The first exhibition in the new building featured watercolors and paintings that had come to Portland as part of the 1905 Exposition. Curator Henrietta H. Failing (the niece of founder Henry Failing) organized the exhibition with New England artist Frank Vincent DuMond. Three years later, in 1908, the museum acquired its first original piece of art, Afternoon Sky, Harney Desert by American impressionist painter Childe Hassam, who frequented Malheur and Harney counties in Eastern Oregon with his friend, C.E.S. Wood. Anna Belle Crocker succeeded Henrietta Failing as curator of the museum in 1909. She would remain at the museum until her retirement in 1936. Crocker became one of the Portland Art Museum's most important early figures. She was also the first head of the Museum Art School, which opened in 1909 and is now the Pacific Northwest College of Art. In late 1913, the museum hosted one of its most important early exhibitions. The exhibition featured artwork that had been on display earlier that year at the famous 1913 New York Armory Show, which introduced American audiences to modern art. The exhibition included works by C√©zanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Matisse, Manet, Renoir, and the controversial Nude Descending a Staircase by Marcel Duchamp. The museum continued to grow during the years following World War I. In the 1920s, the museum hosted two memorable exhibitions organized by Sally Lewis, the daughter of a prominent Portland family. Lewis had befriended many well-known artists on trips to New York and Europe. In 1923, Lewis organized an exhibition at the museum that included 44 paintings by Picasso, Matisse, Andr√© Derain and American modernists, such as Maurice Prendergast, Charles Burchfield, and Max Weber. She was also one of 22 patrons who purchased Derain's Tree for the museum's permanent collection. The success of her first exhibition led to her second, more daring endeavor a year later that juxtaposed paintings, drawings, and sculptures from Europe with African masks. Among the sculptures was Br√¢ncu»ôi's A Muse, which Lewis owned and donated to the museum in 1959. Main building A staircase inside the museum The museum's final location opened to the public on November 18, 1932, at the corner of SW Park Avenue and Jefferson Street. The building, designed by noted Portland architect Pietro Belluschi, is situated along downtown Portland's South Park Blocks and remains a landmark in the city's Cultural District. It was constructed with a lead gift of $100,000 from Winslow B. Ayer, the same patron who selected the museum's collection of plaster casts 40 years earlier. For this reason, the original portion of today's larger main building is referred to as the Ayer Wing. Barely six years later, construction began on a new wing to expand the main building. The Hirsch Wing, also designed by Pietro Belluschi, was funded largely through the bequest of Ella Hirsch in honor of her parents, Solomon and Josephine Hirsch. The new wing opened on September 15, 1939 and doubled the museum's gallery space. Post war In 1942, the Portland Art Museum celebrated a subdued 50th Anniversary due to World War II. But the following year in 1943, staff completed the museum's first full inventory, which counted a permanent collection of 3,300 objects and 750 works on long-term loan. The next decade was distinguished by a series of record- setting exhibitions. In 1956, nearly 55,000 visitors came to the museum during the six-week run of an exhibition featuring paintings from the collection of Walter Chrysler. The exhibition was organized by the Portland Art Museum and toured nine other cities. More than 80,000 people visited for a Vincent van Gogh exhibition in 1959, the proceeds from which were used to purchase Water Lilies by Claude Monet. The 1950s also witnessed the creation of the museum's Docent Council in 1955, which created a core group of volunteers who continue to serve the museum to this day. In the 1960s, the museum underwent another major renovation to build the Hoffman Memorial Wing, named for L. Hawley Hoffman (1884-1959; son of Portland based artist and arts patron Julia Christiansen Hoffman), who served as president of the museum twice. Funded by the museum's first capital campaign, the new wing began construction in November 1968 and was finished in September 1970. Pietro Belluschi served as the architect again, and the project allowed him to realize a complete vision for the museum that he had conceived nearly 40 years earlier. The expansion created classroom and studio space for the Museum Art School, a sculpture mall, a new vault for the collections, and an auditorium. Over the course of the next several decades, the collections and programs of the Portland Art Museum continued to grow and evolve. In 1978, Vivian and Gordon Gilkey began their association with the museum, bringing with them an extraordinary collection of thousands of works on paper that would eventually lead to the opening of the Vivian and Gordon Gilkey Center for Graphic Arts in 1993. Also in 1978, the Northwest Film Center was incorporated into the museum, offering a wide range of film festivals, classes, and outreach programs focused on the moving image arts. Modern era PAM's Mark Building The Portland Art Museum celebrated its centennial in 1992, which was marked by successful negotiations to purchase the Masonic Temple, now known as the Mark Building. The purchase was completed in 1994, the same year that a capital campaign to finance a refurbishment of the Main Building began. This ambitious project included improving the galleries, reinstalling the permanent collection, and equipping the building with a climate control system. The refurbishment allowed the museum to host the most successful exhibition in its history: Imperial Tombs of China, which brought 430,000 visitors to the museum the following year. A major renovation of the Hoffman Wing was completed in 2000 and added more than of new gallery space to the museum. The first gallery space addition since 1939, the new galleries included the Grand Ronde Center for Native American Art and the Arlene and Harold Schnitzer Center for Northwest Art. The renovation was funded by the largest capital campaign ever undertaken by a cultural organization in the State of Oregon, which raised $45 million. In 2001, the Portland Art Museum announced the largest single acquisition in its history when it purchased the private collection of renowned New York art critic Clement Greenberg. The 159 works by artists such as Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, and Anthony Caro substantially enhanced the museum's permanent collection of 20th century modern and contemporary art. The museum renovated the former Masonic temple which it purchased in 1990s and opened in 1995 as Mark Building. The renovated building holds the six-floor, Jubitz Center for Modern and Contemporary Art, the largest exhibition space for modern and contemporary art in the region. The Mark Building also houses the 33,000 volume Crumpacker Family Library, meeting spaces, ballrooms, and administrative offices. Now with a collection consisting of some 40,000 objects, the Portland Art Museum is one of the leading cultural institutions in the Pacific Northwest. The museum is currently under the leadership of Brian Ferriso, The Marilyn H. and Dr. Robert B. Pamplin, Jr. Director since 2006.

Background  The accused, Mr. Hundal, was driving an overloaded dump truck above the speed limit through downtown Vancouver. When Mr. Hundal entered an intersection on a red light he collided with a car that had also just entered the intersection on a green light, killing the driver. The accused claimed that he entered the intersection on a yellow and did not have time to stop. However the trial judge rejected this based on the evidence of several eyewitnesses. Mr. Hundal was convicted of dangerous driving causing death under s.249(1) of the Criminal Code. His appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal was dismissed.  Reasoning  Justice Cory, writing for the majority, recognised that mens rea could be proven subjectively or objectively depending on the offence. The offence at issue should be assessed objectively within the context of all the surrounding events. \\"The trier of fact must be satisfied that the conduct amounted to a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused's situation.\\" [emphasis added] On this modified objective standard it was found that Mr. Hundal was driving in a manner that was dangerous to public safety. Analysis A truck driver negligently drove through a red light killing the driver of another car. The facts of the case are not important, only in that they invoke the Supreme Court to assess whether the charge of dangerous driving, found under sec. 249(1) of the CC, should be assessed objectively or subjective. The Justices were unanimous in their agreement that it should be assessed objectively, but differed as to why they had reached that decision. The majority (six justices), headed by Justice Sopinka, were of this opinion: the nature of driving offences suggests that a modified objective test is appropriate. They listed the following reasons: 1 The licensing requirement ‚Äì each driver demonstrates that they are mentally and physical capable of driving before they are licensed. Moreover, it serves to confirm that those who drive are familiar with the standards of care required by all drivers. Additionally, drivers choose to engage in the activity of driving, and thus, place themselves in a position of responsibility. As a result, a consideration of the personal factors, so essential in determining the subjective intent, is not necessary in light of the fixed standards that must be met by licensed drivers. 2 Automatic and reflexive nature of driving ‚Äì the nature of driving itself is often so routine and automatic that it is almost impossible to determine a particular state of mind of a driver at any given moment. It would, thus, be a denial of common sense for a driver, whose conduct was objectively dangerous, to be acquitted on the ground that he was not thinking of his manner of driving at the time of the accident 3 Statistics ‚Äì the statistics which demonstrate that all too many tragic deaths and disabling injuries flow from the operation of motor vehicles indicate the need to control the conduct of drivers. There is, therefore, a compelling need for effective legislation which strives to regulate the manner of driving, and the objective test is essential for that. To mitigate the harshness of the objective test, the justices suggested its institution through, what they termed, the modified objective test ‚Äì which Justice McIntyre had suggested in Tutton. The test must not be applied in a vacuum, but rather, in the context of the events surrounding the incident. This enables the court to take into account the sudden and unexpected onset of disease and similar human frailties as well as the objective demonstration of dangerous driving. Thus, the trier of fact may convict if satisfied that, viewed objectively, the accused was, in the words of the section, driving in a manner that was ‚Äúdangerous to the public...\\" In making the assessment, the trier of fact should be satisfied that the conduct amounted to a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused‚Äôs situation. If an explanation is offered by the accused, such as a sudden and unexpected onset of illness, then in order to convict, the trier of fact must be satisfied that a reasonable person in similar circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in the conduct manifested by the accused. Justice McLachlin (Lamer concurring) agrees with the above justice‚Äôs approach to a modified objective test, but differs as to the process. She agrees that the all relevant circumstances, including those personal to the accused should be considered, such as any unexpected heart attacks or epileptic seizures. However, she believes that the better analysis of someone who is unable to control their motor vehicle because of the onset of some disease (or something beyond their control) should be that the Actus Reus element is not established. She argues that the onset of the disease and the subsequent erratic driving amounts to an involuntary act. The Actus Reus of the offence cannot be established unless the act is voluntary. Thus we need not reach the question of what a reasonable person would have been thinking or adverting to as the care goes off the road, much less what the accused was in fact thinking or not thinking.

The number of decuriones varied in different towns, but was usually 100. The qualifications for the office were fixed in each town by a special law for that community (lex municipalis). Cicero (in Verr. 2. 49, 120) alludes to an age limit (originally thirty years, until lowered by Augustus to twenty-five), to a property qualification (cf. Pliny, Ep. i. 19. 2), and to certain conditions of rank. The method of appointment varied in different towns and at different periods. In the early municipal constitution ex-magistrates passed automatically into the senate of their town; but at a later date this order was reversed, and membership of the senate became a qualification for the magistracy. Cicero (loc. cit.) speaks of the senate in the Sicilian towns as appointed by a vote of the township. But in most towns it was the duty of the chief magistrate to draw up a list (album) of the senators every five years. The decuriones held office for life. They were convened by the magistrate, who presided as in the Roman Senate. Their powers were extensive. In all matters the magistrates were obliged to act according to their direction, and in some towns they heard cases of appeal against judicial sentences passed by the magistrate. By the time of the municipal law of Julius Caesar (45BC) special privileges were conferred on the decuriones, including the right to appeal to Rome for trial in criminal cases. Under the principate their status underwent a marked decline. The office was no longer coveted, and documents of the 3rd and 4th centuries show that means were devised to compel members of the towns to undertake it. By the time of the jurists it had become hereditary and compulsory. This change was largely due to the heavy financial burdens which the Roman government laid on the municipal senates. * The leader of a decuria, a subdivision of the curia. * Decurion (Roman cavalry officer), an officer in the Roman cavalry, originally commanding a troop of ten men (decuria) during the early republican era. In the late republic and during the empire a decurio commanded a turma of 32 men in the auxiliary cavalry. It is the equivalent of the ancient Greek dekarchos, a cavalry officer. *Decurio was also a name given to certain priests intended, as it should seem, for some particular sacrifices, or other religious ceremonies; or for the sacrifices of private families and houses, as Burkhard Gotthelf Struve (1671-1738) conjectures, who from that source derives their name. Whatever the origin of the name, we have an inscription in Gruter's work, which confirms their function: ANCHIALVS. CVB. AED. Q. TER. IN. AEDE. DECVRIO. ADLECTVS. EX. CONSENSV. DECVRIONVM. FAMILIAE.

In the aquarium trade it is used to describe various kinds of freshwater snails whose shells are planispiral, meaning that the shell is a flat coil. Such shells resemble a coil of rope, or (as the name suggests) a ram's horn. In a more general natural history context, the term \\"ramshorn snails\\" is used more precisely to mean those aquatic pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Planorbidae that have planispiral coiled shells. Ramshorn snails have been bred for the aquarium trade and various color forms have been selected. The two species commonly found in aquariums are Planorbella duryi and Planorbarius corneus, both in the family Planorbidae. One species (Columbia ramshorn, Marisa cornuarietis) is from a totally different family, the Ampullariidae. Ramshorn snails can sometimes become a nuisance in an aquarium, because some of them breed so profusely. Description Red ramshorn snail Most of these snails are of the family Planorbidae, and they include the species Planorbarius corneus. There are two different coloured skin forms: black and red; the latter lack the dark skin pigment melanin and consequently have a bright reddish skin, which is the colour of their blood. Their blood contains red hemoglobin, unlike other snails' blood, which contains greenish hemocyanin. These ramshorn snails breathe air. Although most of them are extremely small, some may reach a size of two and a half centimeters (one inch). The shells range from translucent through various shades of brown to a dark, nearly black color. The dark color appears to originate from dietary materials not generally available in the home aquarium, although many varieties from ponds are this dark shade. There are two common skin colourations: black and red. The red colouration is the colour of their blood (containing hemoglobin), unlike other snails with green blood (due to hemocyanin). An absence of melanin reveals the red colour . Rare varieties have been selectively bred in pale pink and blue. These traits are recessive and if crossbred the resultant offspring are likely to be wild type (brown). Snails of this family are spiralled sinistrally, with the opening hole slanted downward toward the right. Large folds of skin may protrude out of the more open left side. Like all air-breathing water snails, the animal has no operculum, and has only one pair of tentacles with the eye spots at the base of the tentacles. Ramshorn snails have a lifespan on one year . = Breeding = Ramshorn snails are hermaphroditic;Ramshorn Snail ‚Äì The Care, Feeding and Breeding of Ramshorn Snails Red Ramshorn Snail Factoids two organisms of any sex have the ability to breed and produce offspring. Ramshorn snails lay eggs in globules, which tend to be brownish in color. The globules contain about a dozen or so eggs, though it can vary. The globules are translucent, so it is possible to visually see the new snails develop in size. The newborn snails are clearish white. Interaction with environment Ramshorn snail with calcium deficiency. Ramshorn snails generally will eat only the most delicate plants, preferring algae, uneaten fish food, and dead fish. Some varieties do particularly enjoy eating the leaves of stem plants such as cabomba and anacharis. Some aquarium species will eat ramshorn snails. More voracious eaters include puffers, loaches (such as the clown loach or any other member of the genus Botia), bettas, crayfish, and most gouramis-- though many other fish will also consume snail meat. Apple snails and assassin snails will also prey upon ramshorn snails. Good fish roommates for snails include, but are not limited to, danios, guppies, White Cloud Mountain minnows, neon tetras, and cory catfish. All of these are non-aggressive fish that cohabit easily with snails. One should also be aware that pond-reared red ramshorn snails are able to carry various parasitic flukes, which can be transmitted to fish, or humans. Most of these flukes require intermediate hosts, so that leaving the snails in a fish-free aquarium for a month or so will eliminate any parasites. If the population is kept to a manageable size, ramshorn snails can be good tank cleaners. They eat algae and dead or dying plants generally, so they can be useful. However, if they breed too prolifically they can become a nuisance. In warm climates (such as those in mainland Australia or the southern United States) they much prefer ponds, especially outdoor ponds. Algae, dead leaves that sink to the bottom, mulm and dead animals can be a problem, as they foul the water. Ramshorn snails eat all of these things. Role as aquarium pest Most ramshorn snails are considered minor aquarium pests. They may arrive in a tank as egg bundles hidden in newly acquired plants. Although their red color may make them somewhat interesting aquarium subjects, their hermaphroditic ability to breed prolifically from any two specimens can make them troublesome. Absolute eradication is difficult, but their numbers can usually be kept to a moderate level. Common methods to reduce population include treating plants to prevent introduction, various manual methods of control, introducing the snail-eating animals listed earlier, and poisoning the snails. Soaking the plants in various chemicals may kill off the snails and their eggs. A 10-minute bath in a solution of 20 parts water to 1 part chlorine bleach has been suggested for hardier plants, followed by soaking in water containing a dechlorinating agent. A more gentle treatment calls for 5-10 tablespoons of alum to 1 gallon of water for 2‚Äì3 days. A safer alternative may be placing the plants in a quarantine tank, and adding snail poisons to that tank rather than the main show tank. Manual methods include baiting the snails with lettuce (run it under hot water first and leave overnight), cucumber slices, or food pellets. These may be left out in the open, and removed with their snails, or kept in some container, such as a film canister weighed down with a pebble, and containing holes drilled in it. Crushing the snails by hand as they appear can also effectively limit their population; most ramshorn shells are fragile enough that this is quite easily done. Introducing animals to control a snail population can require some thought. Other aquarium fish may not be compatible, and some larger adult snails may be too big to be eaten by smaller snail eating species. It may occasionally be necessary to crush a few snails manually so that the fish realize the snail can be eaten. Snail eating species also do not usually discriminate between different types of snails, although this is usually not much of a concern. Snail poisons are generally considered to be a last resort, as most of them are copper-based and are potentially toxic to plants and fish and particularly dangerous to other invertebrates. Even new safer chemicals that do not harm the other aquarium inhabitants may cause damage if large numbers of dead snails are allowed to decompose. For this reason, it is best to reduce the snail population by other means as much as possible before resorting to poisons, and to do frequent water changes afterwards. Some also recommend adding ammonium protection to the tank. Zeolite chips, and various liquid products such as amquel may help in this area. \\"Giant ramshorn\\" snails Totally unrelated to these ramshorn snails is the species Marisa cornuarietis, which is often sold at pet stores under the name \\"Columbian ramshorn\\" or \\"giant ramshorn\\" snail. This species is actually a kind of apple snail, albeit one with a planispiral shell. They are distinguished by having an operculum by which they can close themselves into their shell, two pairs of tentacles, separate genders, and a siphon on the left side. Its shell is yellowish, with brown stripes running the length of the shell. These apple snails lay gelatinous masses of eggs on submerged portions of plants. They can grow to up to four centimeters in size. They generally will not become a pest, although they can consume large amounts of plant matter. They are very large compared to other Ramshorn snails.

An excerpt from A Home at the End of the World was published in The New Yorker, chosen for Best American Short Stories 1989, and featured on NPR's Selected Shorts. Plot summary Bobby had grown up in a home in suburban Cleveland, Ohio during the 1960s and 1970s where partying and drugs were a recurring theme. He has already witnessed the death of his mother and beloved older brother by the time he befriends Jonathan, who comes from a sheltered family. After Bobby finds his father is dead, Jonathan's family takes him in. Bobby and Jonathan become best friends, and also experiment sexually. The two eventually lose touch, but meet up again in their 20s in 1980s New York, where Bobby moves in with Jonathan and his eccentric roommate Clare. Clare had planned to have a baby with Jonathan (who is openly gay), but Bobby and Clare become lovers, while Jonathan still has feelings for Bobby. Clare and Bobby have a baby and move to a country home together with Jonathan. The trio form their own family, questioning traditional definitions of family and love, while dealing with the complications of their polyamourous relationship.

Alpha Omega Alpha currently has active Chapters in 132 LCME accredited medical schools in the United States and Lebanon. It annually elects over 4,000 new members based on an election process. The majority of new members are elected in their final year of medical school, but distinguished teachers, faculty members, residents, and alumni can also be inducted into the society. All elections are held at local Chapters. No elections are held nationally. History ŒëŒ©Œë was founded in 1902 by William Webster Root and five other medical students at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, which later became the University of Illinois College of Medicine. The impetus for its formation was the generally poor quality of American medical schools and students at the time; Root and his colleagues wished to promote excellence in these groups. They decided that membership in ŒëŒ©Œë was to be based on both scholarly achievement and professional conduct. Root pitched his idea to nearby schools, and soon the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine and Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine had set up chapters. By 1912, there were seventeen chapters. As more medical schools became interested, the national organization was able to become more selective in the standards a school had to meet to be eligible. Root stated in the original constitution of ŒëŒ©Œë: \\"The mission of ŒëŒ©Œë is to encourage high ideals of thought and action in schools of medicine and to promote that which is the highest in professional practice.\\" The ŒëŒ©Œë motto is, \\"Be Worthy to Serve the Suffering.\\" Root defined the duties of ŒëŒ©Œë members, \\"to foster the scientific and philosophical features of the medical profession, to look beyond self to the welfare of the profession and of the public, to cultivate social mindedness, as well as an individualistic attitude toward responsibilities, to show respect for colleagues, especially for elders and teachers, to foster research and in all ways to ennoble the profession of medicine and advance it in public opinion. It is equally a duty to avoid that which is unworthy, including the commercial spirit and all practices injurious to the welfare of patients, the public, or the profession.\\" http://alphaomegaalpha.org/history.html Collections of the society's papers were donated to the National Library of Medicine in 1973 by John Z. Bowers, and in 2000 by Gladys Brill Brampton. Purpose The current constitution states that, \\"Alpha Omega Alpha is organized for educational purposes exclusively and not for profit, and its aims shall be the promotion of scholarship and research in medical schools, the encouragement of a high standard of character and conduct among medical students and graduates, and the recognition of high attainment in medical science, practice, and related fields.\\" To this end, only those who are considered the top medical students are elected. After securing the students permission, a first cut is made and the top academic quartile is evaluated. Of that group, one-sixth of a medical school's graduating class can be elected members of ŒëŒ©Œë. Most are elected as fourth-year students (\\"senior ŒëŒ©Œë\\") although a smaller amount of third-year students (\\"junior ŒëŒ©Œë\\") are eligible for election. Membership  Faculty, alumni, and residents can be elected to ŒëŒ©Œë Chapters for what is considered scholarly achievement. ŒëŒ©Œë elections are held at the 130 ŒëŒ©Œë Chapters, and overseen by the ŒëŒ©Œë faculty Councilor. New members are expected to register with the national office and remain active by paying a modest dues annually. Controversy ŒëŒ©Œë elections at some institutions have been plagued by internal political and racial bias. A 2017 publication in JAMA Internal Medicine found that \\"Black and Asian medical students were less likely than their white counterparts to be members of ŒëŒ©Œë, which may reflect bias in selection. In turn, ŒëŒ©Œë membership selection may affect future opportunities for minority medical students.\\" This pattern persisted despite controlling for other co-variates such as extracurricular activities. Because \\"the Constitution of ŒëŒ©Œë gives many degrees of freedom to each chapter for the process of election of student members\\",http://alphaomegaalpha.org/how.html election to ŒëŒ©Œë remains incredibly variable between medical schools and may reflect the local chapter's internal politics rather than academic achievement. While many of the most elite American medical schools have completely done away with student chapters of ŒëŒ©Œë, the most high-profile is the decision of the Mt. Sinai Icahn School of Medicine to completely forgo medical student elections to ŒëŒ©Œë in September 2018. 12 National Programs and Awards Medical students, faculty, and active ŒëŒ©Œë members associated with ŒëŒ©Œë Chapters are eligible to participate in the 12 national programs and awards that ŒëŒ©Œë confers annually.

It also refers to the inscription of books or other artifacts when these are specifically addressed or presented to a particular person.Definition of \\"dedicating\\" from Merriam-Webster's dictionary. Retrieved 15 November 2008. This practice, which once was used to gain the patronage and support of the person so addressed, is now only a mark of affection or regard. In law, the word is used of the setting apart by a private owner of a road to public use.  Feast of Dedication  The Feast of Dedication, today Hanukkah, once also called \\"Feast of the Maccabees,\\" was a Jewish festival observed for eight days from the 25th of Kislev (usually in December, but occasionally late November, due to the lunisolar calendar). It was instituted in the year 165 B.C. by Judas Maccabeus, his brothers, and the elders of the congregation of Israel in commemoration of the reconsecration of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, and especially of the altar of burnt offerings, after they had been desecrated during the persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes (168 BC). The significant happenings of the festival were the illumination of houses and synagogues, a custom probably taken over from the Feast of Tabernacles, and the recitation of .The biblical references are 1 Maccabees 1:41-64, 4:36-39; 2 Maccabees 6:1-11; . See also 2 Maccabees 1:9, 18; 2:16; and Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XII. v. 4. According to the Second Book of Chronicles, the dedication of Solomon's Temple took place in the week before the Feast of Tabernacles.Barnes, A., Barnes' Notes on 2 Chronicles 7, accessed 19 April 2020 J. Wellhausen suggests that the feast was originally connected with the winter solstice, and only afterwards with the events narrated in Maccabees. The Feast of Dedication is also mentioned in , where the writer mentions Jesus being at the Jerusalem Temple during \\"the Feast of Dedication\\" and further notes \\"and it was winter\\". The Greek term used in John is \\"the renewals\\" (Greek œÑ·Ω∞ ·ºêŒ≥Œ∫Œ±ŒØŒΩŒπŒ±, ta enkainia).Andreas J. K√∂stenberger John 2004 \\"... incident occurred only about one month later (December 18‚Äì25).57 This is the first reference to the Feast of Dedication by this name (ta egkainia, ta enkainia [a typical ‚Äúfestive plural‚Äù]) in Jewish literature (Hengel 1999: 317). \\" Josephus refers to the festival in Greek simply as \\"lights.\\"Mercer Dictionary of the Bible ed. Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard, 1990. \\"Hence Hanukkah also is called the Feast of Lights, an alternate title Josephus confirms with this rationale: 'And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it \\"Lights\\".' I suppose the reason was, because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival.\\" (Per The works of Flavius Josephus translated by William Whiston.)  Dedication of churches  Churches under the authority of a bishop (e.g., Orthodox, Roman Catholic, or Anglican) are usually dedicated by the bishop in a ceremony that used to be called that of consecration, but is now called that of dedication. For the Catholic Church, the rite of dedication is described in the Caeremoniale Episcoporum, chapters IX-X, and in the Roman Missal's Ritual Masses for the Dedication of a Church and an Altar. In the Church of England, a consecrated church may only be closed for worship after a legal process (a \\"pastoral scheme\\"). =Early customs= The custom of solemnly dedicating or consecrating buildings as churches or chapels set apart for Christian worship must be almost as old as Christianity itself. When we come to the earlier part of the 4th century allusions to and descriptions of the consecration of churches become plentiful. This service is probably of Jewish origin: the hallowing of the tabernacle and of its furniture and ornaments (Exodus 40); the dedication of Solomon's Temple (I Kings 8) and of the Second Temple by Zerubbabel (Ezra 6); its rededication by Judas Maccabaeus (see above); the dedication of the temple of Herod the Great;Josephus, Antiqities of the Jews, XV. c. xi. 6. and Jesus' attendance at the Feast of Dedication (). All these point to the probability of the Christians deriving their custom from a Jewish origin. Eusebius of CaesareaEusebius, Ecclesiastical History X. 3. speaks of the dedication of churches rebuilt after the Diocletian persecution, including the church at Tyre in 314 AD. The consecrations of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem in 335, which had been built by Constantine I, and of other churches after his time, are described both by Eusebius and by other ecclesiastical historians. From them we gather that every consecration was accompanied by a celebration of the Holy Eucharist and a sermon, and special prayers of a dedicatory character, but there is no trace of the elaborate ritual of the medieval pontificals dating from the 8th century onwards. The separate consecration of altars is provided for by Canon 14 of the Council of Agde in 506, and by Canon 26 of the Council of Epaone in 517, the latter containing the first known reference to the usage of anointing the altar with chrism. The use of both holy water and of unction is attributed to St. Columbanus, who died in 615.Walafrid Strabo, Vita S. Galli, cap. 6. There was an annual commemoration of the original dedication of the church, a feast with its octave extending over eight days, during which Gregory the Great encouraged the erection of booths and general feasting on the part of the populace, to compensate them for, and in some way to take the place of, abolished pagan festivities.Sozomen, Ecclesiastical History II. cap. 26; Venerable Bede, Ecclesiastical History I. cap. 30. At an early date the right to consecrate churches was reserved to bishops, as by a canon of the First Council of Bracara in 563, and by the 23rd of the Irish collections of canons, once attributed to St Patrick, but hardly to be put earlier than the 8th century.Haddon and Stubbs, Councils, &c.;, vol. ii. pt. 2, p. 329. =Medieval Western customs= Latin dedicatory inscription of 1119 for the church of Pr√ºfening Abbey, Germany Mosaic showing the Greek and Latin alphabets in Notre-Dame de la Daurade, France The manuscripts and printed service-books of the medieval church contain a lengthy and elaborate service for the consecration of churches in the pontifical. The earliest known pontifical is that of Egbert, Archbishop of York (732‚Äì766), which, however, only survives in a 10th-century manuscript copy. Later pontificals are numerous and somewhat varied. A good idea of the general character of the service can be obtained from a skeleton of it as performed in England after the Reformation according to the use of Sarum. The service is taken from an early 15th-century pontifical in the Cambridge University Library as printed by W. Makell in Monumenta ritualia ecclesiae Anglicanae.W. Makell, and ed. Monumenta ritualia ecclesiae Anglicanae, Vol. I. pp. 195-239. There is a preliminary office for laying a foundation-stone. On the day of consecration the bishop is to vest in a tent outside the church, then proceed to the door of the church on the outside, a single deacon being inside the church. There he blesses holy water, twelve lighted candles being placed outside, and twelve inside the church. He then sprinkles the walls all round outside and knocks at the door. He then sprinkles the walls all round outside a second time, then a third time, knocking at the door each time. He may then enter, all laity being excluded. The bishop then fixes a cross in the centre of the church, after which the litany is said, including a special clause for the consecration of the church and altar. Next the bishop inscribes the alphabet in Greek letters on one of the limbs of St Andrews cross from the left east corner to the right west corner on the pavement cindered for the purpose, and the alphabet in Latin on the other limb from the right east corner to the left west corner. He then genuflects before the altar or cross, blesses water, mingled with salt, ashes and wine, and sprinkles it on all the walls of the church inside three times, beginning at the altar. He next sprinkles the centre of the church lengthwise and crosswise on the pavement and goes round the outside of the church sprinkling it three times. Next, reentering the church and taking up a central position, he sprinkles holy water to the four points of the compass, and up towards the roof. Next he anoints the twelve internal and twelve external wall-crosses with chrism before walking around the church three times inside and out and censing it. Then there follows the consecration of the altar. First, holy water is blessed and mixed with chrism. With the mixture the bishop makes a cross in the middle of the altar, then on the right and on the left, then on the four horns of the altar. The altar is then sprinkled seven times or three times with water not mixed with chrism and the altar table is washed, censed and wiped with a linen cloth. The centre of the altar is next anointed with the oil of the catechumens in the form of a cross. After the altar stone has been anointed with chrism, the whole altar is rubbed over with oil of the catechumens and with chrism. Incense is next blessed, and the altar censed, five grains of incense being placed crosswise in the centre and at the four corners. On the grains, five slender candle crosses are placed and lit. Afterwards the altar is scraped and cleansed. The altar cloths and ornaments are sprinkled with holy water and placed on the altar, which is then to be censed. All this is subsidiary to the celebration of Mass, with which the whole service is concluded. The transcription and description of the various collects, psalms, anthems and benedictions which make up the order of dedication have been omitted. The Sarum order of dedication described above is substantially identical with the Roman order. There is, however, one very important and significant piece of ritual, not found in the English church order, but always found in the Roman service, and not infrequently found in the earlier and later English uses, in connection with the presence and use of relics at the consecration of an altar. According to the Roman ritual, after the priest has sprinkled the walls of the church inside three times all round and then sprinkled the pavement from the altar to the porch, and sideways from wall to wall, and then to the four quarters of the compass, he prepares some cement at the altar. He then goes to the place where the relics are kept, and starts a solemn procession with the relics round the outside of the church. There a sermon is preached and two decrees of the council of Trent are read together with the founder's deed of gift or endowment. Then the bishop, anointing the door with chrism, enters the church with the relics and deposits them in the cavity or confession in the altar. Having been enclosed they are censed and covered in, and the cover is anointed. Then follows the censing and wiping of the altar as in the Sarum order. This use of relics is very ancient and can be traced back to the time of St Ambrose. There was also a custom, now obsolete, of enclosing a portion of the consecrated Eucharist if relics were not obtainable. This was ordered by cap. 2 of the council of Celchyth (Chelsea) in 816. But though ancient, the custom of enclosing relics was not universal, and where found in English church orders, as it frequently is found from the pontifical of Egbert onwards, it is called the Mos Romanus as distinguished from the Mos Anglicanus (Archaeologia, liv. 416). It is absent from the description of the early Irish form of consecration preserved in the Leabhar Breac, translated and annotated by Rev. T. Olden.Transactions of the St Pauls Ecclesiolog. Soc. vol. iv. pt. ii. p. 98. The curious ritual act, technically known as the abecedarium, i.e. the tracing of the alphabet, sometimes in Latin characters, sometimes in Latin and Greek, sometimes, according to M√©nard, in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, along the limbs of St Andrews cross on the floor of the church, can be traced back to the 8th century and may be even older. Its origin and meaning are unknown. One explanation was suggested by Rossi and adopted by the bishop of Salisbury. This interprets the St Andrew's cross as the initial Greek letter of Christus, and the whole act as significant of taking possession of the site to be consecrated in the name of Christ, who is the Alpha and Omega, the word of God, combining in himself all letters that lie between them, every element of human speech. The three languages may then have been suggested by the Latin, Greek and Hebrew, in which his title was written on the cross. The disentangling the Gallican from the Roman elements in the early Western forms of service was undertaken by Louis Duchesne, who shows how the former partook of a funerary and the latter of a baptismal character.Christian Worship (London, 1904), cap. xii. =Eastern Orthodox form= The dedication service of the Eastern Orthodox Church is likewise long and elaborate. At the beginning of construction, the bishop or his deputy blesses a cornerstone for the church. Relics may be placed inside the cornerstone, and it will be topped with a plate giving the name of the patron saint of the new church, the names of the saints whose relics were deposited in the cornerstone (if any), the name of the ruling bishop, and the date. After all construction on the building is finished, preparations are made for the solemn consecration of the church. The relics which will be placed in the Holy Table (altar) and the antimension are to be prepared and guarded on the previous day in some neighboring church (if there is no neighboring church, the relics are placed on a small table in front of the icon of Christ on the iconostasion). The night before the consecration, an all-night vigil is celebrated; however, no one will enter the altar (sanctuary) of the new church yet, and the Holy Doors remain closed. On the morning of the consecration, everything needed for the consecration, the sacred vessels, and all of the appurtenances of the sanctuary (altar cloths, candlesticks, etc.) are prepared on a table placed in front of the Holy Doors, together with a Gospel Book and blessing cross. The bishop (or his representative) and clergy vest and proceed to the church. The clergy carry the table into the sanctuary and literally construct the Holy Table: the mensa (table top) is placed on the four pillars and four nails are driven in with stones. A prayer of dedication is said, followed by an ektenia (litany). Warm water is poured thrice upon the Holy Table, and it is wiped down by the priests, and then washed with a mixture of rose water and red wine (signifying baptism). It is then anointed with chrism in the form of a cross (signifying chrismation). The altar, the Gospel Book, and the altar cloths are then censed, every pillar is crossed (anointed in the sign of the cross) with chrism, while various hymns and psalms are chanted. The sanctuary lamp is then filled with oil and lit, and placed on or above the altar, while clergy bring in other lamps and other ornaments of the church. Then, the bishop and clergy go to the neighboring church where the relics have been kept and guarded. A procession is formed and advances thence with the relics, which are borne by a priest in a diskos (paten) on his head; the church having been entered, the relics are placed by him with much ceremonial in the confession (the recess prepared in or under the altar for their reception) which is then anointed and sealed up. After this the Divine Liturgy is celebrated both on the day of dedication and on seven days afterwards. =Anglican forms= There is no authorized form for the dedication of a church in the reformed Church of England. A form was drawn up and approved by both houses of the convocation of Canterbury under Archbishop Tenison in 1712, and an almost identical form was submitted to convocation in 1715, but its consideration was not completed by the Lower House, and neither form ever received royal sanction. The consequence has been that Anglican bishops have fallen back on their undefined jus liturgicum, and have drawn up and promulgated forms for use in their various dioceses, some of them being content to borrow from other dioceses for this purpose. There is a general similarity, with a certain amount of difference in detail, in these various forms. In the Diocese of London the bishop, attended by clergy and churchwardens, receives outside the west door a petition for consecration; the procession then moves round the whole church outside, while certain psalms are chanted. On again reaching the west door the bishop knocks thrice with his crozier, and the door being opened the procession advances to the east end of the church, where prayers are said and the first Eucharist celebrated. =Methodist forms= The Methodist Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965) has the following Christian liturgies with respect to dedications: \\"An Office for the Dedication of a Church Building\\", \\"An Office for the Dedication of a School, College, or University Building\\", \\"An Office for the Dedication of a Hospital\\", \\"An Office for the Dedication of a Church Organ or Other Instruments for Sacred Music\\", and \\"An Office for the Dedication of a Memorial\\". In its ritual found in the Discipline, the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection includes a rite for the dedication of churches, as well as one for the dedication of parsonages. The Evangelical Wesleyan Church, in \\"The Ritual\\" part of its Discipline, contains a liturgy for the Dedication of Churches. Child dedication A child dedication ceremony takes place in some Christian churches that practice adult baptism. The child is presented to the congregation, and vows are made to raise him or her in the Christian tradition (similar to an infant baptism ceremony), but the child is not baptised, as some churches only accept adult or 'believers' baptism.  Dedication of a marriage or relationship  Some denominations offer a dedication for a marriage or relationship. A service of dedication is used in the Church of England to bless a couple after a civil marriage. The Church of England's Diocese of Hereford \\"voted to support a motion calling on the House of Bishops to 'commend an Order of Prayer and Dedication after the registration of a civil partnership or a same sex marriage'.\\" Individual Anglican congregations in England may already offer same-sex couples \\"a special service of prayer and dedication.\\" See also *Consecration *Cornerstone *Ex-voto *Dedication (publishing) NotesReferences * External links *Urbs Beata Jerusalem dicta pacis visio - Catholic Encyclopedia article ","title":"Dedication"},{"id":"1638197","text":"The mainly ice-covered Prehn Peninsula () is long and wide, between Hansen and Gardner Inlets, on the eastern coast and at the base of Antarctic Peninsula.

She was born in Australia and also held United States citizenship. Hazzard's 1970 novel, The Bay of Noon, was shortlisted for the Lost Man Booker Prize in 2010; her 2003 novel The Great Fire won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction, the Miles Franklin Award and the William Dean Howells Medal.\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 2003\\", National Book Foundation website; retrieved 27 March 2012. Hazzard also wrote non-fiction, including two books based on her experiences working at the United Nations Secretariat, which were highly critical of the organisation. Early life Hazzard was born in Sydney to a Welsh father (Reginald Hazzard) and a Scottish mother (Catherine Stein Hazzard), both of whom had immigrated to Australia in the 1920s. She attended Queenwood School for Girls in Mosman, New South Wales, but left in 1947 when her father became a diplomat and was posted to Hong Kong.Lawson, Valerie (2004) \\"Hazzard country\\", in The Sydney Morning Herald, 19‚Äì20 June 2004, p. 31. Her parents had intended for her to study at the university there, but it had been destroyed in the war. Instead, at the age of 16, Hazzard began working for the British Combined Intelligence Services, until she was \\"brutally removed by destiny\\" ‚Äì first to Australia, as her sister was ill, and then to New Zealand when her father became Australian Trade Commissioner there. She said of her experience of the East that \\"I began to feel that people could enjoy life, should enjoy life\\". At the age of 20, in 1951, Hazzard and her family moved to New York City and she worked at the United Nations Secretariat as a typist for about 10 years. In 1956, Hazzard was posted to Naples for a year and began to explore Italy; she visited annually for several years afterward. Writing Hazzard wrote her first short story, \\"Woollahra Road\\", in 1960 while in Siena, and it was accepted and published by The New Yorker magazine the following year. She resigned from her position at the United Nations and began writing full time. Her first book, Cliffs of Fall, published in 1963, was a collection of stories which had previously appeared in the magazine. Her first novel, The Evening of the Holiday, was published in 1966. Her second, The Bay of Noon, appeared in 1970, and follows British people in Italy shortly after the Second World War. The Transit of Venus, her third novel, is described by The Guardian as her \\"breakthrough\\". It follows a pair of sisters from Australia, who are living very different lives from each other in post-war Britain. American academic Michael Gorra writes: \\"Its social landscape will be familiar to any reader of Lessing or Murdoch or Drabble, and yet it is not an English novel. Hazzard lacks the concern with gentility ‚Äì for or against ‚Äì that marks almost all English writers of her generation. She has the keenest of eyes for the nuances of class ... and yet doesn't appear to have anything herself at stake in getting it all down.\\" Her final novel, The Great Fire, appeared more than 20 years later. Its protagonist is a British war hero in Asia a few years after the war. In addition to fiction, Hazzard wrote two non-fiction books critical of the United Nations: Defeat of an Ideal (1973) and Countenance of Truth (1990). In Defeat of an Ideal Hazzard presented evidence of the apparently widespread McCarthyism in the Secretariat from 1951 to 1955. In Countenance of Truth Hazzard alleged that senior international diplomats had been aware of the Nazi past of Kurt Waldheim yet had allowed him to rise through the Secretariat ranks to the position of Secretary-General, a claim she had first made in an article in The New Republic in 1980. Her collection of short stories, People in Glass Houses, is presented as a satire on \\"The Organisation\\", but this fiction is manifestly inspired by the United Nations. She wrote Greene on Capri, a memoir of her friendship with Graham Greene, whom she met in the 1960s and considered an influence. Her last work of nonfiction, The Ancient Shore: Dispatches from Naples (2008), is a collection of writings on Naples, Italy, co-authored with her husband, Francis Steegmuller. =Style and themes= Hazzard admired the writing of Henry James and Ivy Compton- Burnett, and critics have noted similarities with their work, particularly in the use of dialogue. Critics describe Hazzard's writing style as \\"austere\\" and concise. Critics have noted that Hazzard's characters and plots often mirrored events and people in her own life. According to one commentator, Hazzard's early life \\"was a carbon copy of Helen Driscoll's\\" (the heroine of The Great Fire). Helen and her brother, the dying Benedict, are described as \\"wonderfully well-read, a poetic pair who live in literature\\", and Hazzard once said that poetry had always been the centre of her life. In addition, the character of Helen Driscoll had to move to New Zealand, as Hazzard had done. Similarly, the character of Elizabeth in Hazzard's short story \\"Sir Cecil's Ride\\" is young, living in Hong Kong, and working for Combined Services Intelligence. Awards and honours In 1977, Hazzard's short story \\"A Long Story Short\\", originally published in The New Yorker on 26 July 1976, received an O. Henry Award. The Transit of Venus won the 1980 National Book Critics Circle Award. The Great Fire garnered the 2003 National Book Award, the 2004 Miles Franklin Award, and the 2005 William Dean Howells Medal; it was also shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction, longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize, and named a 2003 Book of the Year by The Economist. The Bay of Noon was nominated for the Lost Man Booker Prize in 2010. She was a fellow of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and the British Royal Society of Literature, and an Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. In 1984, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation invited Hazzard to give the Boyer Lectures, a series of radio talks delivered each year by a prominent Australian. The talks were published the following year under the title Coming of Age in Australia.Coming of Age in Australia: book details, nla.gov.au; accessed 14 December 2016. In 2012, a conference was held in her honor at the New York Society Library and Columbia University.Shirley Hazzard Symposium , unsw.edu.au; accessed 14 December 2016. Personal life In 1963, Hazzard married the writer Francis Steegmuller, and the couple moved to Europe. They initially lived in Paris, with visits to Italy, and in the early 1970s settled in Capri.

The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time of the meridian 52 degrees and 30 arcminutes west of the Greenwich Observatory.  Scope  The Newfoundland Time Zone consists only of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Officially, the entire province is in the Newfoundland Time Zone by legislation.http://www.assembly.nl.ca/legislation/sr/statutes/s23.htm In practice, however, Newfoundland Time is observed only on Newfoundland, its offshore islands, and southeastern Labrador communities south of Black Tickle. The rest of Labrador, from Cartwright north and west, observes the Atlantic Time Zone along with the rest of Atlantic Canada. Southeastern Labrador prefers Newfoundland Time in part to synchronize with the schedule of radio broadcasts from Newfoundland. This time zone exists because of the location of the island and the fact that it was a separate dominion when the time zones were established. Newfoundland lies squarely in the eastern half of the Atlantic Time Zone, exactly three and a half hours from Greenwich. Since the Dominion of Newfoundland was separate from Canada, it had the right to adopt its own time zone. While the entire province lies west of the standard meridian for a half-hour time zone, 52.5 degrees west longitude, this is also the near exact meridian of St. John's, the province's capital and largest city. In 1963, the Newfoundland government attempted to bring the province into conformity with the other Atlantic provinces, but withdrew in the face of stiff public opposition. Daylight saving time is observed throughout the province. In 1988, the provincial government experimented with double daylight saving time, moving clocks ahead two hours during daylight saving time instead of just one. However, this forced children to go to school in the dark in October. In 2006, the province enacted an extension to daylight saving time, starting in 2007, following the lead of the United States and other Canadian provinces. This unusual time zone puts the island of Newfoundland an hour and a half ahead of Central Canada, a half hour ahead of the rest of Atlantic Canada, and half an hour behind Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. Because of this, it will hit milestones of time before (almost) any other part of the continent, a quirk that draws attention to Newfoundland. For instance, the Newfoundland releases of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Halo 2 were publicized across Canada. Also, it is very common for the lone independently owned-and- operated TV station in the province, CJON (known on-air as \\"NTV\\"), to use a \\"World Television Premiere\\" bumper at the start of some programming that airs before most other North American stations air them. Likewise, in the case of Canada-wide broadcasts timed to air at the same local hour in the rest of the country through the use of a different feed for each time zone (most commonly the CBC's radio and TV networks), Newfoundland uses Atlantic-time broadcasts. References to programs airing at \\"6:00, 6:30 in Newfoundland\\" are commonly heard across Canada. However, whenever the province's two full-fledged stations, CJON and CBNT (both based in St. John's), originate local programming, they usually refer to it as \\"coming up at 6:00, 5:30 in most of Labrador.\\" Major metropolitan areas *St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador *Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador See also * Newfoundland's Daylight Saving Act of 1917 Sources * Official times across Canada * World time zone map * U.S. time zone map * History of U.S. time zones and UTC conversion (dead link) * Canada time zone map * Time zones for major world cities References Category:Time zones Category:Time in Canada Category:Culture of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Newfoundland Time Zone"},{"id":"1638215","text":"The Deister The Deister is a chain of hills in the German state of Lower Saxony, about 15 mi (25 km) southwest of the city of Hanover. It runs in a north-westerly direction from Springe in the south to Rodenberg in the north. The next in the chain of hills to the south is the Kleiner Deister (\\"Little Deister\\") from which it is separated by the flat pass of the Deister Gate. It is surrounded by Springe, Wennigsen, Barsinghausen, Bad Nenndorf, Rodenberg and Bad M√ºnder (counter-clockwise, starting in the south). It has a total length of 21 km (14 mi), and rises in the Hofeler to a height of 395 m (1,250 ft). The highest point is the Br√∂hn at 405 m (1,312 ft). The chain is well- wooded and abounds in game. From the 17th century on there were several coal mines; the last were abandoned in the 1950s. Sandstone from quarries in eastern Deister was used in several important buildings all over Europe, including the opera house in Hanover and the Reichstag in Berlin. Today the Deister is a popular target for people of the Hanover area for walking and cycling. The Deister is a border region since ancient times. Here one can find many places with memorial stones, tumuli and ruins of castles.  Flora and fauna  The ridge is covered by a mixed forest of beech and spruce and, in places, also beech and oak. On the Cecilienh√∂he near Bad Nenndorf, at the picnic area of Lauenau-Feggendorf and southwest of the old forester's lodge at K√∂llnischfeld are several examples of the rare, native dwarf beech (S√ºntelbuche). Image:Deister_Kammweg.jpgSpruce and beech wood along the Deister ridgeway Image:FeggendorfGrillplatz.jpgDwarf beeches at the Feggendorf picnic site Amongst the rarer plants on the Deister are species of holly, mezereon, orchids, sundews, globeflowers, hard shield fern, and great snowdrops. The Deister is home to the typical animals found in the German Central Uplands. Red deer, roe deer and wild boar are very common. Other wild animals occurring here are the pine marten and beech marten, stoat, polecat, dwarf weasel and red fox. Birds of prey include the buzzard, goshawk and red kite. Rarer small animals include the mouse-eared bat and lesser horseshoe bat. Hills Most of the hills in the Deister have a tower at the top, used for various purposes.

The beach faces Bass Strait and backs the Gippsland Lakes. The beach is just over in length, running north-eastward from a spit near Port Albert to the man-made channel at Lakes Entrance. Behind the beach are long sandy dunes that separate the Gippsland Lakes from Bass Strait. The beach is an uninterrupted stretch of untamed coastline; it does not have any rocky headlands or platforms, and offshore there are only a few ribbons of reef which are periodically covered by sand. In the northern section, the beach runs along a sandbar on what amounts to a series of tidal islands. Behind this are several large lakes and numerous shallow littoral lagoons. The three main lakes are Lake King, Lake Victoria and Lake Wellington, partially contained within The Lakes National Park. Location The Ninety Mile Beach is located about from Melbourne and can be reached from the South Gippsland Highway passing the coastal towns of McLoughlins Beach, Woodside, Seaspray, Golden Beach, and Loch Sport. The beach is located within the Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park, with the Ninety Mile Beach Marine National Park located off-shore.  Tourism  Ninety Mile Beach attracts a large number of visitors each year and offers a wide variety of activities such as camping, picnicking, whale watching, and beach and water- based activities. The beach has golden sand, with crashing waves and a natural bush environment. It is part of the Ninety Mile Beach Marine National Park, which covers 2,750 hectares and of coastline, south of Sale. There are basic camping facilities within the park at Emu Bight, as well as accommodation at Seaspray and Lakes Entrance. Rotamah Island, which is part of the Lakes National Park, has a large bird observatory, and can be visited by boat from Paynesville, about away. Coastal towns of Woodside, Lochsport, Seaspray, Golden Beach and Lakes Entrance are popular tourist towns, attracting large numbers of visitors during the warmer months. Woodside, Seaspray and Lakes Entrance have life saving beach patrols during the summer season. Surf fishing is a key drawcard for the area, with main varieties of fish including snapper, flathead and gummy sharks. Port Albert, McLoughlins Beach, Lochsport and Lakes Entrance have jetties and temporary berthing facilities. Ecology The beach's length ensures that the waves break too close to the beach for good surfing, and there are strong rip currents and cross-currents that make conditions rather hazardous. The local authorities recommend that anyone who wishes to swim should do so at Woodside, Seaspray and Lakes Entrance, which have life saving beach patrols during the summer season. The beach is believed to be the fourth longest uninterrupted beach in the world, behind Praia do Cassino on the Brazilian southern coast, Padre Island on the US Gulf Coast and Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia, which is actually long. Wild horses were introduced to the park after the islands were explored to help eat and trample down small areas of bush so it could be more easily explored but they were left unchecked and their numbers quickly increased. Their large numbers grew and over time started to cause concern as environmental damage became an issue, but once the park was established as a national heritage the horses were rounded up and transported back across to the mainland.

Organised by ITF, a British organiser, it grew to become the third largest airshow in the world, and was touted by its organisers as the \\"world‚Äôs second most influential airshow\\" . ITF was subsequently acquired by Reed Exhibitions in 1982. Held once every two years, it boasted 759 exhibiting companies from 37 countries, a total of 26,814 trade visitors from 81 countries recorded, and trade deals amounting to US$3.52 billion were concluded in the 2004 event. The largest edition of the show was held from 21 February to 24 February 2006, the 13th and final show in Singapore. Held jointly with several conferences including the Asia Pacific Security Conference (APSEC), the C4I Asia Conference (C4i Asia), the Asia Pacific Airline Training Symposium (APATS), the Asian Aerospace UAV Asia-Pacific Conference and the IATA/Asian Aerospace Aviation Summit, it featured a rebranded Asian Defense Technology military component.

The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas are the most common manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14‚Äì34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors. Any of these conditions that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, it appears to be a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German Shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD. Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome can manifest similarly to other diseases, which must be ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel‚ÄìLindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care. Signs and symptomsSkin= Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome affects the skin and increases the risk of tumors in the kidneys and lungs. The condition is characterized by multiple noncancerous dome-shaped tumors of the hair follicles (fibrofolliculomas), particularly on the face, neck, and‚Äîmore rarely‚Äîthe upper chest. The fibrofolliculomas are generally described as having an opaque white color or a yellowish tone and have a waxy, smooth texture. The tumors are always found on and around the nose and on and behind the outer ear. Typically, they first appear in a person's 20s or 30s, and are found in more than 80% of people with the syndrome above the age of 40. The tumors become larger and more numerous over time. Tumors differ between individuals: they may appear merged in plaques, look similar to a comedo with a plug of keratin, or include epidermoid cysts. A large number of tumors on the face can be associated with hyperseborrhea (abnormally elevated sebum production). The presence of fibrofolliculomas on a person's face can cause significant psychological distress. Other tumors can include trichodiscomas (tumors of the hair disc, which may be identical to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa- colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions that appear to be acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax. =Kidneys= A H&E; stain of tissue from a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, the second most common cancer associated with BHD People over 20 years of age with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome have an increased risk of developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and men are more likely to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20. In general, people with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome are at roughly seven times the risk of kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%‚Äì34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger. =Lungs= Along with fibrofolliculomas and kidney tumors, affected individuals frequently develop cysts (blebs or bullae) in the subpleural lung base or intraparenchymal space that may rupture and cause an abnormal collection of air in the chest cavity (pneumothorax), which could result in the collapse of a lung. The cysts do not cause other symptoms and lung function is usually normal. More than 83% of people with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© have cysts, however, the syndrome does not cause conditions like progressive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or generalized respiratory failure, though it does cause emphysema. Spontaneous, sometimes recurrent, pneumothorax occurs far more often and at a younger age with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© than in the unaffected population. Approximately 24% of people with the disease suffer at least one spontaneous pneumothorax, 30 times the occurrence in unaffected people. Though pneumothorax caused by Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© often occurs in middle age, at a median age of 38, 17% of affected people have a spontaneous pneumothorax before turning 40. Pneumothoraces have been seen in people as young as 7 and 16 years of age. Some families have a form of BHD that only affects the lungs. =Other organs= Thyroid nodules have been associated with the Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome. However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated. Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, medullary thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, colonic polyposis, connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face, trichoblastomas, cutaneous focal mucinosis, cutaneous leiomyoma, breast cancer, tonsillar cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. PathophysiologyGenetics= This diagram shows how autosomal dominant disorders like BHD are passed on. The unaffected parent produces all normal gametes (sperm and egg) and the affected parent produces half mutant gametes and half normal gametes. Because only one copy of the mutation is needed to have an autosomal dominant disease, each offspring has a 50% chance of having the mutation. An association with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© families. There is no significant difference in the symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered. =Function= FLCN creates a protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears to act as a tumor suppressor and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome. Most of the cancer-causing mutations cause the protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has shown to be the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates‚Äîit is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in some people with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome. The lysine at this position is found to be conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating that it is important to the protein's function. Folliculin is encoded by the FLCN gene, located on the p arm of human chromosome 17. People with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome are born with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency‚Äîonly having one functional copy of the FLCN gene‚Äîis enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, the result is that these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN has been found to be overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice. Diagnosis BHD can be suggested by clinical findings but is definitively diagnosed by molecular genetic testing to detect mutations in the FLCN gene. The classical clinical triad includes benign growths of the hair follicles; pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax; and bilateral, multifocal renal tumors. =Clinical triad= The cutaneous manifestations of Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often found on the face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered on the basis of cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations. =Genetic testing= FLCN mutations are detected by sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome. This means that some people with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not detectable by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of and to provide a means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms. =Differential diagnosis= The person in this image has tuberous sclerosis. The skin lesions caused by tuberous sclerosis (angiofibromas) must be distinguished from the characteristic fibrofolliculomas of BHD, which also occur primarily on the face. Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© can be difficult to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel‚ÄìLindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology. Hereditary recurrent pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts are associated with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary. Though fibrofolliculomas are unique to Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√©, they may present with an ambiguous appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Management The different manifestations of Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, this is not a permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway. Epidemiology The disorder has been reported in more than 100 families worldwide, though some sources cite up to 400 families, and it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is considered to be under-diagnosed because of the variability in its expression. The pattern of mutations and spectrum of symptoms are heterogeneous between individuals. Less severe skin phenotypes are seen in women and people of both sexes who have a late onset of skin symptoms.

This is a privacy protected site that provides up-to-date information for individuals interested in the latest scientific news, trials, and treatments related to rare lung diseases. History The syndrome was first well described in 1977, by three Canadian physicians, Arthur R. Birt, Georgina R. Hogg and William J. Dub√©. The earliest case of possible BHD in the medical literature was published by Burnier and Rejsek in 1927, who described a case of perifollicular fibromas on a 56-year- old woman's face. Trichodiscomas were first described in 1974 by H. S. Zackheim and H. Pinkus, but were not associated with BHD until Birt, Hogg, and Dub√©. The first case of BHD with the systemic symptoms was described by Hornstein and Knickenberg and found in two siblings and their father, all of whom exhibited colon polyps and the characteristic fibrofolliculomas. Though the siblings did not have renal or pulmonary symptoms, their father had cysts in his lungs and kidneys. Hornstein-Knickenberg syndrome is a now-deprecated name for the inherited fibrofolliculomas inherent to Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√©. Birt, Hogg, and Dub√© examined a family with a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered that many of the members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members. Other animals Genes related to FLCN and diseases similar to BHD have been found in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD‚Äîkidney cancers (in this case, multifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas. A homolog of FLCN called DBHD has been discovered in the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Decrease expression of the DBHD results in loss of male germline stem cells (GSC), which suggest that DBHD is required for male GSC maintenance in the fly testis.Singh SR, Zhen W, Zheng Z, Wang H, Oh SW, Liu W, Zbar B, Schmidt LS, Hou SX. The Drosophila homolog of the human tumor suppressor gene BHD interacts with the JAK-STAT and Dpp signaling pathways in regulating male germline stem cell maintenance. Oncogene. 2006 Sep 28;25(44):5933-41. Further, DBHD regulates GSC maintenance downstream or in parallel of the JAK/STAT and Dpp signal-transduction pathways, which suggest that BHD regulates tumorigenesis by controlling stem cells in human {Singh SR, Zhen W, Zheng Z, Wang H, Oh SW, Liu W, Zbar B, Schmidt LS, Hou SX. The Drosophila homolog of the human tumor suppressor gene BHD interacts with the JAK-STAT and Dpp signaling pathways in regulating male germline stem cell maintenance. Oncogene. 2006 Sep 28;25(44):5933-41 Singh et al. 2006} A line of rats with hereditary kidney cancer were developed by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear-cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued. Knockout mice have been created for a kidney-cancer causing mutation of BHD; heterozygotes develop kidney cysts and tumors that lead to renal failure within three weeks of birth. In these mice, the mTOR pathway was inappropriately activated, indicating that the mouse homolog of FLCN plays a regulatory role in this pathway. Rapamycin partially rescued the phenotype by regulating mTOR. Homozygotes die in utero.

Early life Mary Delany was born at Coulston, Wiltshire, the daughter of Colonel Bernard Granville by his marriage to Mary Westcombe, loyal Tory supporters of the Stuart Crown. She was a niece of George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne, her father's brother. Mary had one older brother, Bernard (1699), known as Bunny; a younger brother Bevil, born between 1702 and 1706; and a sister, Anne (1707).M. Peacock, 'Mrs Delany begins her life's work' in The Paper Garden (2010) beginning at p. 72; Dewes ( 1940) When Mary was young, her parents moved the family to London, and she attended a school taught by a French refugee, Mademoiselle Puelle. Mary came into close contact with the Court when she was sent to live with her aunt, Lady Stanley, who was childlessDewes 1940, p. 20. ‚Äì the intention being that she would eventually become a Maid of Honour.Hayden, 1980. While living with Lady Stanley, Mary became learned in \\"English, French, history, music, needlework and dancing...\\". She came into contact with Handel while at the household, listening to music he had composed; for the rest of her life she was a close personal friend and loyal supporter of the composer.Dewes 1940, p. 22. Mary's hopes to become a lady in waiting were dashed by Queen Anne's death in 1714, which led to a change in power, and a Hanoverian on the throne, supported by the Whigs. The Granvilles moved to a manor at Buckland in Gloucestershire, where they became isolated from English society. However, Mary was able to continue her education and her pursuit of paper cutting, which had developed at an early age. Near the end of 1717 Mary was invited to stay with her uncle, Lord Lansdowne, in Wiltshire. She was introduced to Alexander Pendarves during this stay, and it soon became clear that her family had an interest in a marriage between the two. Pendarves was Member of Parliament for Launceston and 60 years old, while Mary was 17. In February 1718 she was unhappily married to him, a marriage brought on by her parents' financial dependence on Lord Lansdowne, and Lord Lansdowne's hope to gain political influence. Married life The Pendarveses left for Roscrow Castle near Falmouth in west Cornwall in April; once settled, Mrs Pendarves was able to enjoy the views that Roscrow offered, and was able to spend time riding. Mr Pendarves's gout grew worse as the year progressed, and in the second year of their marriage, Mrs Pendarves was forced to nurse her ailing husband, and pass her time sewing and painting flowers. In 1721, the two took a house in London and there, though Mr Pendarves began to drink excessively, Mrs Pendarves was reunited with many of her old friends. In 1725, Mr Pendarves died suddenly in his sleep. He had not altered his will after his marriage, and so Mrs Pendarves did not inherit what remained of his estate. \\"Mr. Pendarves, concerned with the bottle that allowed him to forget the loss of part of his fortune, had had no time to consider settling the rest of it on his wife.\\"Dewes 1940, p. 79. Despite her lack of resources, widowhood provided new opportunities for Mrs Pendarves. Widows, unlike unmarried women, were able to move freely in society, and for the first time in her life, Mrs Pendarves was able to pursue her own interests without the oversight of any man. Perhaps because of her own unhappy marriage, she was not satisfied with the options available to women in the 18th century. She wrote, Mrs Pendarves was a very perceptive woman, \\"She judged everything and everybody for herself; and, while ridiculing all empty-headed or vain insipidity, whether fashionable or eccentric, was always ready to applaud the unusual, if sincere and worthy. She was eager in the acquisition of knowledge of all kinds to the end of her life...\\"Johnson, R. Brimley. Mrs. Delany (London: Stanley Paul & Co. Ltd. 1925) p. xxiv. Because she had no home of her own, after her first husband's death Mrs Pendarves spent time living with various relatives and friends. A wealthy friend, the Duchess of Portland, included Mary in her artistic and scientific \\"Hive\\" where she met Joseph Banks, the botanist, and she visited his home to see samples and drawings from his travels with Captain Cook. She bred plants, drew and painted with needlework these exotic flora. To begin with, she lived with her aunt and uncle Stanley, and after her aunt's death, she spent time in Ireland with the family of her friend Mrs Donellan. In Ireland, Mrs Pendarves made the acquaintance of Dr Patrick Delany, an Irish clergyman who was already married to a rich widow. It was not until 1743, two years after the death of his first wife, that on a trip to London Dr Delany proposed to Mrs Pendarves, much to the dismay of her family. They were married in June 1743. The Delanys passed a year in London before moving to Dublin, where Dr Delany had a home. They also rented Mount Panther in County Down and during their first year in the house Patrick was made Dean of Down. Both husband and wife were very interested in botany and gardening: After twenty- five years of marriage, most of it spent in Ireland, Dr Delany died in Bath, England, on 6 May 1768 at the age of eighty-four, and Mrs Delany, now sixty- eight, found herself again a widow.Paston, George. Mrs. Delany (Mary Granville): a memoir, 1700‚Äì1788 (Edinburgh: G. Richards, 1900) p. 191. Later life As a widow, Mary Delany spent even more of her time at Bulstrode, the home of her close friend, Margaret Bentinck, Dowager Duchess of Portland. The two shared an interest in botany, often going out to look for specific specimens. It was during her frequent stays at Bulstrode that Mary became acquainted with two well-known botanists of the time: Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander. This contact with the botanists encouraged Mary's interest in botany and also developed the knowledge on which many of her flower paper-cuttings are based. Mary Delaney died on 15 April 1788. There is a memorial to her in St James's Church, Piccadilly. A memorial to Mary Delaney in St James's Church, Piccadilly. Career as an artist Mary Delany had always been an artist, but during her marriage to Dr Delany she had the time to hone her skills. She was also a gardener, and did needlework, drawing, and painting; but was best known for her paper-cutting: > \\"For these 'mosaicks' are coloured paper representing not only conspicuous > details but also contrasting colours or shades of the same colour so that > every effect of light is caught\\".Hayden 1980, p. 13. She struck up a > friendship with Letitia Bushe, a watercolourist and miniaturist, with whom > she embarked on a number of artistic projects. In 1771, a widow in her early 70s, Mary began on decoupage, a fashion with ladies of the court. Her works were detailed and botanically accurate depictions of plants, using tissue paper and hand colouration. She created 985 of these works, calling them her \\"Paper Mosaiks \\",Laird 2009. from the age of 71 to 88, when her eyesight failed her.Laird 2009, p. 36. > \\"With the plant specimen set before her she cut minute particles of coloured > paper to represent the petals, stamens, calyx, leaves, veins, stalk and > other parts of the plant, and, using lighter and darker paper to form the > shading, she stuck them on a black background.

It is thought she first > dissected each plant so that she might examine it carefully for accurate > portrayal...\\"Hayden 1980, pp. 132‚Äì133. Mary became well known, and donors began to send her flowers to cut.Hayden 1980, p. 143. Her work can be seen in the Enlightenment Gallery at the British Museum. Upon her death, \\"The ten volumes of Mrs. Delany's Flora Delanica were inherited by Lady Llanover, the daughter of Georgina Mary Ann Port. Lady Llanover, who died in 1896 at the age of ninety-four, bequeathed these volumes to the British Museum...\\"Vulliamy 1935, p. 256. When her patroness, the Dowager Duchess, died, King George III and Queen Charlotte gave her a small house at Windsor and a pension of ¬£300 a year. Mrs. Delany had become familiar with Queen Charlotte while living in the house at Windsor, becoming an important part of the inner circle of the court, teaching the young children about plants and sewing skills. The King and Queen were great supporters; she was given a locket of the queen's hair and a portrait of Delany was arranged by the king, then hung in the queen's bedchamber; they said of her paper- cutting, to have \\"...always desired that any curious or beautiful plants should be transmitted to Mrs. Delany when in blossom.\\"Vulliamy 1935, p. 254. Frances Burney (Madame D'Arblay) was introduced to her in 1783, and frequently visited her at her London home and at Windsor, and owed to her friendship her court appointment. She had known many of the luminaries of her day, had corresponded with Jonathan Swift, Sir Joseph Banks, and Young, and left a detailed picture of polite English society of the 18th century in her six volumes of Autobiography and Letters (ed. Lady Llanover, 1861‚Äì1862). Burke calls her \\"a real fine lady, the model of an accomplished woman of former times\\". The Ulster Museum in Belfast holds an embroidered bedcover by Mrs Delaney, one of the few complete pieces of embroidery made by her. Other pieces are described in letters, including pieces sewn with violets, auriculas, geraniums , poppies, Madonna lilies. Her own clothes were embroidered richly, including a ballgown probably designed for the birthday of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1751 with pinks, lily of the valley, winter jasmine, scent peas, love-in-a-mist, anemones, tulips, bluebells and forget- me-nots in accurate anatomical detail. In 1980, a descendant of Delany's sister Anne, Ruth Hayden, published a book on Delany's work: Mrs. Delany and Her Flower Collages, which was reissued in 2000 as Mrs. Delany: Her Life and Her Flowers (British Museum Press). A biography of Delaney by Clarissa Campbell Orr was published in 2019.

Faraday first described them in an appendix to an article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1831.Faraday, M.

If a layer of liquid is placed on top of a vertically oscillating piston, a pattern of standing waves appears which oscillates at half the driving frequency, given certain criteria of instability. This relates to the problem of parametric resonance. The waves can take the form of stripes, close-packed hexagons, or even squares or quasiperiodic patterns. Faraday waves are commonly observed as fine stripes on the surface of wine in a wine glass that is ringing like a bell. Faraday waves also explain the 'fountain' phenomenon on a singing bowl.

The building was included on the America's Favorite Architecture list, created in 2007 by the American Institute of Architects. Structural system A massive concrete arch dominates this interior view The rink employs an innovative structural system employing a 90-meter reinforced concrete arch, a catenary arch form for which Saarinen's projects became known. From the arch a cable net is strung, supporting a timber roof. This causes a stable, double curvature form. Exterior cables linking the arch directly to the outer edges of the roof were added during structural design development. These cables address forces caused by asymmetrical wind loads. Fred N. Severud was the structural engineer for the project. Bombing On May 1, 1970, several rock bands were playing a concert in Ingalls Rink as part of the protests on New Haven Green against the Black Panther trials. Shortly before midnight and towards the end of the concert, two bombs exploded in the north end of the rink's basement. The explosions caused no injuries, but shattered the building's glass doors and caused cracks to form in its arch. No culprit was ever identified, and both Yale President Kingman Brewster and New Haven Police Chief James Ahern contended that either pro- or anti-Panther partisans could have planted the devices. Renovations Rink interior with timbered roof The building has been renovated by Kevin Roche and Roche-Dinkeloo, the firm which is a direct outgrowth of Eero Saarinen and Associates. In 1991, a new concrete refrigerant slab was added at a cost of $1.5 million. In 2007, it was announced that the rink would undergo a $23.5 million renovation which would include approximately of varsity operational space as well as a complete renovation of the facility, including new men's and women's varsity locker rooms, training and strength and conditioning rooms, an added press box, a lower level hockey heritage area, offices for coaches of both programs, a student-athlete study area, new lights, as well as a sound system and de-humidification unit. The lower level interior would also be decorated with photos displaying the history of Yale hockey. These renovations were completed in 2009.

Philosophy In metaphysics, Bindu is considered the point at which creation begins and may become unity. It is also described as \\"the sacred symbol of the cosmos in its unmanifested state\\".Khanna 1979: p.171 Bindu is the point around which the mandala is created, representing the universe.Shakya, p. 82-83 Bindu is often merged with [seed] (or sperm) and ova. In the Yoga Chudamani Upanishad Bindu is a duality, with a white Bindu representing shukla (pure) and a red Bindu representing maharaj (mastery). The white Bindu resides in the bindu visarga and is related to Shiva and the Moon, while the red Bindu resides in the muladhara chakra and is related to Shakti and the Sun.Saraswati, p. 144 In yoga, the union of these two parts results in the ascension of kundalini to the sahasrara.Kumar, p. 94 Chakra Purple Bindu chakra (may also be red) In Tantra, Bindu (or Bindu visarga‚Äî\\"falling of the drop\\") is a point at the back of the head where Brahmins grow their tuft of hair.Saraswati, p. 21Kumar, p. 8-9 This point is below the sahasrara chakra and above the ajna chakra, and is represented by a crescent moon with a white drop. It represents the manifestation of creations such as consciousness.Saraswati, p. 143 The Bindu visarga is said to be the source of Bindu fluid, which contains a nectar (amrita) and a poison.Saraswati, p.141-142 The fluid is released from the Bindu visarga, and can be stored in the lalana chakra and purified in the Vishuddha chakra. When the Vishuddha is inactive the fluid flows to the manipura chakra, where it is consumed (leading to physical decline). According to the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, a hatha yoga practitioner can prolong their life by controlling the flow of the fluid. Through practice of Khecari mudra, a practitioner can manipulate the flow of the fluid from the lalana to the Vishuddha (where it is purified to amrita). The picture of the chakra is a lotus with 23 petals. Its symbol is the moon, which supports the growth of vegetation. Krishna said in the Bhagavad Gita XV/13, \\"Becoming the nectarine moon I nourish all plants\\". Its divinity is Shiva, who is portrayed with the crescent moon in his hair. The Bindu chakra is a centre for health, giving us the power for physical and mental recuperation. It benefits eyesight, quietens the emotions and promotes inner harmony, clarity and balance. With the help of this chakra we are capable of controlling hunger and thirst, gaining the ability to overcome unhealthy eating habits. Concentration on Bindu relieves anxiety and depression, nervousness and feelings of oppression in the heart. Tibetan letter \\"A\\", with the iconographic representation of a rainbow circle In Tibetan Buddhism Bindu refers to the subtle body, which is composed of drops (Tibetan: ‡Ωê‡Ω≤‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ω£‡Ω∫ thig le) and winds (Tibetan: ‡Ω¢‡æ≥‡Ω¥‡ΩÑ rLung).http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/developing_balanced_sensitivity/pt5/sensitivity_17.html Grasping at Mind's Natural Functions for Security.

Audiences and artists come from across India and her diaspora to enjoy the season. History The Madras Music Season was first created in the 1927 by a group of individuals who later went on to establish the Madras Music Academy.Lakshmi (2004), p123 Concerts would be held at various venues at different places every year, before the Madras Music Academy settled on its present venue at T.T.K. Road. Although the season was initially held during March/April (the Tamil month of Panguni), the timing of the season was later changed to December (the Tamil month of Maargazhi) due to more favourable weather conditions and the likelihood of attracting more tourists during this period. The All India Music Conference was held in 1927 concurrently with the annual session of Indian National Congress in Madras. A resolution was passed at the conference to formally establish the Madras Music Academy. From 1928, the academy started organizing the Music Season every year during the month of December.Knight (2010), p78 Previously it was a traditional month-long Carnatic music festival solely consisting of Carnatic music concerts, harikathas, lecture demonstrations (otherwise known as lec-dems) and award/title ceremonies. However, over the years it has also diversified into dance and drama, as well as non-Carnatic art forms, and is now of a duration of at least six weeks. The festival The Music Season has grown over the years, and has been described as one of the world's largest cultural events.The Hindu : Opinion / Editorials : MUSIC MUSINGS Generally, the concerts take place in the afternoons and nights, and consists of all sorts of Carnatic music compositions and improvisations.Nettl (1995), p90 In 2004‚Äì2005, there were over 1200 performances by about 600 artists (about 700 vocal, 250 instrumental, 200 dance, 50 drama and others).Chennai Music Season 2004 - 2005 Sabhas and Halls The performances are typically organised by sabhƒÅs.

Biography  She was the daughter of Jean de Lou, sieur de l'Orme, president of the treasurers of France in Champagne, and of Marie Chastelain. She was born in a wealthy family at her father's ch√¢teau near Champaubert. Initiated into the philosophy of physical pleasures by the epicurean and atheist Jacques Vall√©e, Sieur Des Barreaux, she soon left him for Cinq Mars, at that time at the height of his popularity, and succeeded, it is said, in marrying him in secret. She began hosting a salon, and was introduced into the life of being a courtesan. From this time Marion Delorme's salon became one of the most brilliant centres of elegant Parisian society. After the execution of Cinq Mars she is said to have numbered among her lovers and benefactors Charles de Saint-√âvremond (1610-1703) the wit and litterateur, George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√© (called The Great Cond√©), and even Cardinal Richelieu. Under the Fronde her salon became a meeting place for the disaffected, and Mazarin is said to have sent officials to arrest her when she suddenly died. The cause of her death, and whether she actually did die then, or rather later, is still debated.  Legend  Her last years have been adorned with considerable legend (cf. Eug√®ne de Mirecourt, Confessions de Marie Delorme, Paris, 1856). It seems established that she died in 1650. But she was believed to have lived until 1706 or even 1741, after having had the most fantastic adventures, including marriage with an English lord, and an old age spent in poverty in Paris. Her name has been popularized by various authors, especially by Alfred de Vigny in his novel Cinq Mars, by Victor Hugo in the drama Marion Delorme, and by Amilcare Ponchielli and Giovanni Bottesini in two operas of the same title.

It is located next door to the old Colegio de Belen, presently, the Instituto T√©cnico Militar. History Tropicana Club The Tropicana evolved out of a nightclub called Ed√©n Concert, operated in the late 1930s by the late Cuban impresario Victor de Correa. The club was a combination casino and cabaret located on a rented property in Marianao from Guillermina P√©rez Chaumont, known as Mina. The tropical gardens of the Villa Mina provided a natural setting for an outdoor cabaret. In December 1939, de Correa moved his company of singers, dancers and musicians into a converted mansion located on the estate. De Correa provided the food and entertainment, while Rafael Mascaro and Luis Bular operated the casino located in the chandeliered dining room of the estate's mansion. Originally known as El Beau-Site, de Correa decided to rename it The Tropicana. With a fanfare from the Alfredo Brito Orchestra El Tropicana opened on December 30, 1939.Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of The Legendary Cuban Nightclub by Rosa Lowinger with Ofelia Fox (Harcourt Books, 2005) Mart√≠n Fox, a gambler rented table space in the casino.

Tall palm trees growing among the tables lend the proper tropical atmosphere and blend well with the ultra-modernistic architecture. Shows include 50-dancer chorus lines which often branch out into the trees. Rhythms and costumes are colorfully native (voodoo is a frequent theme.) Top names often star.

The Arcos de Cristal may be seen in the Tropicana scene of the movie Our Man In Havana. =Trafficante= Santo Trafficante at San Souci‚Äôs bar. Havana, Cuba, 1955.Santo Trafficante Jr. (November 15, 1914 ‚Äì March 17, 1987) was among the most powerful Mafia bosses in the United States. He headed the Trafficante crime family and controlled organized criminal operations in Florida and Cuba, which had previously been consolidated from several rival gangs by his father, Santo Trafficante Sr. Reputedly the most powerful crime boss in Batista-era Cuba, he never served a prison sentence in the US. Trafficante turned his father's criminal organization into a multi-billion dollar international organized crime empire. Trafficante was reportedly a multi-billionaire and wielded enormous power and influence all over the United States and Cuba by paying off police, judges, federal prosecutors, city officials, government officials, local and international politicians, mayors, governors, senators, congressmen, CIA agents and FBI agents. Trafficante maintained links to the Bonanno crime family, in New York City, but was more closely allied with Sam Giancana in Chicago. Consequently, while generally recognized as the most powerful organized crime figure in Florida throughout much of the 20th century, Trafficante was not believed to have total control over Miami, Miami Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, or Palm Beach. The east coast of Florida was a loosely knit conglomerate of New York family interests with links to Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Angelo Bruno, Carlos Marcello, and Frank Ragano. Trafficante admitted his anti-Castro activities to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978. Though he vehemently denied any association with a conspiracy against President John F. Kennedy, at least one witness before federal investigators testified that Trafficante predicted the assassination in spring of 1963. Federal investigators brought racketeering and conspiracy charges against him in summer of 1986. Santo Trafficante Jr. had been operating in Cuba since the late 1940s under his father, Santo Trafficante, Sr., a mobster in Tampa, Florida. After his father died in 1954, he became the head in Tampa and took over his father's interests in Cuba. Trafficante moved to Cuba in 1955, where he came into contact with Batista and Meyer Lansky. During the rule of Cuba's authoritarian dictator Fulgencio Batista, Trafficante openly operated the Sans Souci Cabaret and the Casino International gambling establishments in Havana. As a leading member of the syndicate, he also was suspected of having behind-the-scenes interests in other syndicate-owned Cuban casinos: the Hotel Habana Riviera, the Tropicana Club, the Hotel Sevilla-Biltmore, the Hotel Capri Casino, the Comodoro, the Hotel Deauville, and the Havana Hilton. Trafficante was apprehended in November 1957, along with over 60 other mobsters, at the Apalachin meeting in Apalachin, New York. All were fined, up to $10,000 each, and given prison sentences ranging from three to five years. All the convictions were overturned on appeal in 1960. Cuba was one of the Apalachin topics of discussion, particularly the gambling and narcotics smuggling interests of La Cosa Nostra on the island. The international narcotics trade was also an important topic on the Apalachin agenda.[6] In January 1958, Trafficante was questioned by the Cuban police regarding the Apalachin meeting. A full report was made by the Cuban police, dated January 23, 1958, includes transcripts of long-distance telephone calls made from the Sans Souci during the period August‚ÄìDecember 1957. The report was given to the District Attorney's office. In addition, \\"on January 23, 1958, the Cuban Department of Investigation, Havana, Cuba notified the Bureau of Narcotics that Santo Trafficante was registered in their Alien Office under No. 93461.\\" See also *Max Borges Jr. *Club N√°utico *Instituto T√©cnico Militar Notes References Gallery File:Max Borges Jr. Tropicana Club. 1953.jpg Image of Tropicana showing Eames chairs.

For 18th-century composers, cantabile is often synonymous with \\"cantando\\" (singing) and indicates a measured tempo and flexible, legato playing. For later composers, particularly in piano music, cantabile is the drawing out of one particular musical line against the accompaniment (compare counterpoint). Felix Mendelssohn's six books of Songs Without Words are short lyrical piano pieces with song-like melodies written between 1829 and 1845. A modern example is an instrumental by Harry James & His Orchestra, called \\"Trumpet Blues and Cantabile\\". A cantabile movement, or simply a \\"cantabile\\", is the first half of a double aria, followed by a cabaletta. The cantabile movement would be slower and more free-form to contrast with the structured and generally faster cabaletta.

The vast majority of mainline trains to and from Bucharest originate from Gara de Nord. History The station was built between 1868 and 1872, the foundation stone was set on 10 September 1868 in the presence of Carol I of Romania. The building is designed as a U-shaped structure. The first railways between Roman ‚Äì Gala»õi ‚Äì Bucharest ‚Äì Pite»ôti were put in service on 13 September 1872. Between 1895 and 1896 a new wing of the station was built, which included a \\"Royal hall\\" due to the visit of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. It was initially named Gara T√¢rgovi»ôtei, after the road nearby, Calea T√¢rgovi»ôtei (\\"T√¢rgovi»ôte Road\\", nowadays Calea Grivi»õei) and took its current name in 1888. The station and its surroundings were heavily bombed by the Allies in April 1944 during a campaign aimed at the Axis supply lines, since the station played an important part in the Romanian railway network and was the main departure point for troops headed to the Eastern Front. Under communist times, the station received a number of upgrades, such as a footbridge (1950s or 1960s), partial electrification on 16 February 1969, and then an expansion between 1978 and 1984 and complete electrification. It is still upgraded as of today, having received a platform overhaul (replacement of tiles with asphalt from 2006 to 2010), removal of the footbridge (replaced with Basarab Overpass in 2009) and, in 2018, replacement of the original split-flap displays with LED ones. Current status There are currently 14 tracks and 8 platforms. As of 2009, Gara de Nord served about 200 trains, including domestic trains operated by CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne, Regiotrans and Trans Feroviar calatori as well international trains to Hungary ‚Äì Budapest, Bulgaria ‚Äì Sofia, Varna and Burgas, Republic of Moldova ‚Äì Chi»ôinƒÉu, Ukraine ‚Äì Kiev, Dnipro and Chernivtsi, Austria ‚Äì Vienna, Turkey ‚Äì Istanbul, Russia ‚Äì Moscow and Saratov, Belarus ‚Äì Minsk. The station is served by several bus ( lines 105, 123,133,178,182,205,282 and express line 780 which links the railway station with the Henri CoandƒÉ Airport) trolleybus (65, 79 and 86 on Grivi»õa side and 62,85,93,96 on The Columnes side) and tram lines (42,45,46 on Grivi»õa side and 44 on Dinicu Golescu side), as well as the Gara de Nord metro station. Also, the station is connected by CFR train to Henri CoandƒÉ International Airport. Future developments In 2019 plans were announced by the Government of Romania's Ministry of Transport to convert Gara de Nord from a terminus station to an underground through station, linking with Bucharest Obor railway station, and a partial underground link between Gara de Nord and Progresul.

In an individual's context, artha includes wealth, career, activity to make a living, financial security and economic prosperity. The proper pursuit of artha is considered an important aim of human life in Hinduism.Bruce Sullivan (1997), Historical Dictionary of Hinduism, , pp 29‚Äì30 At government level, artha includes social, legal, economic and worldly affairs. Proper Arthashastra is considered an important and necessary objective of government.Constance Jones and James Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, , pp 45 In Hindu traditions, Artha is connected to the three other aspects and goals of human life: Dharma (virtuous, proper, moral life), Kama (pleasure, sensuality, emotional fulfillment) and Moksha (liberation, release, self-actualization).

Karl Potter explainsKarl H. Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 1‚Äì29 it as an attitude and capability that enables one to make a living, to remain alive, to thrive as a free person. It includes economic prosperity, security and health of oneself and those one feels responsible for.Scott Walsworth and Suresh Kalagnanam (2013), Applying the Hindu four stage life cycle model to human resource management, International Journal of Indian Culture and Business Management, Volume 6, Number 4, pp 507‚Äì519 Artha includes everything in one's environment that allows one to live. It is neither an end state nor an endless goal of aimlessly amassing money, claims Karl Potter, rather it is an attitude and necessary requirement of human life. John Koller takes a different viewpoint than Karl Potter's interpretation. John Koller suggests artha is not an attitude, rather it is one of the necessities of human life. A central premise of Hindu philosophy, claims Koller, is that every person should live a joyous and pleasurable life, that such fulfilling life requires every person's needs and desires be acknowledged and fulfilled, that needs can only be satisfied through activity and when sufficient means for those activities are available. Artha, then, is best described as pursuit of activities and means necessary for a joyous and pleasurable life. Daya Krishna arguesDaya Krishna, The myth of the purusarthas, in Theory of Value (Editor: Roy Perrett), Volume 5, Taylor & Francis, , pp. 11‚Äì24 that artha, as well as the concept of Puru·π£ƒÅrthas, is a myth. The various schools and ancient Sanskrit texts provide no consensus opinion, notes Krishna, rather they present a debate, a diversity of views on what artha and Puru·π£ƒÅrtha means. Inconsistencies and conflicting verses are even present within the same script, such as the Manusmriti. Some ancient Indian texts suggest artha are instruments that enable satisfaction of desires; some include wealth, some include power, and some such as the bhakti schools include instruments to love God. Some of this, suggests Krishna, reflects differences in human needs. Perhaps, conjectures Krishna, artha is just a subset of kama and karma. Vatsyayana in Kama Sutra defines artha as the acquisition of arts, land, cattle, wealth, equipages and friends. He explains, artha is also protection of what is already acquired, and the increase of what is protected.The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, University of Toronto Archives, pp. 8 Gavin Flood explainsGavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, , pp 11‚Äì13 artha as \\"worldly success\\" without violating dharma (moral responsibility), kama (love) and one's journey towards moksha (spiritual liberation). Flood clarifies that artha in ancient Hindu literature, as well as purushartha, is better understood as a goal of Man (not a man). In other words, it is one of the four purposes of human life. The survival and the thriving of humans requires artha ‚Äì that is, economic activity, wealth and its creation, worldly success, profit, political success and all that is necessary for human existence. History The word Artha appears in the oldest known scriptures of India. However, the term connotes 'purpose', goal or 'aim' of something, often as purpose of ritual sacrifices. Over time, artha evolves into a broader concept in the Upanishadic era. It is first included as part of Trivarga concept (three categories of human life - dharma, artha and kama),See: * Kautilya Arthashastra at 1.7.3‚Äì7; For English translation - Rangarajan (1987), Penguin Classics, ; * Ashok S. Chousalkar (2004), Methodology of Kautilya's Arthashastra, The Indian Journal of Political Science, Vol. 65, No. 1, pp. 55‚Äì76 which over time expanded into the concept Caturvarga (four categories, including moksha). Caturvarga is also referred to as Puru·π£ƒÅrtha.Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, , pp 13‚Äì16 The Mimamsa school of Hinduism explained artha, dharma and kama by contrasting Puru·π£ƒÅrtha and Kratvartha. Puru·π£ƒÅrtha is human purpose of a yajna, while Kratvartha is sacrificial purpose of a yajna. They recognized and explained all human actions have two effects: first, every act affects itself regardless of actors involved; second, every act has human meanings, hopes and desires and affects each actor in a personal way. Jaimini explained in 3rd century BC, that this human meaning cannot be separated from the human goal. The phala (fruit, result) of a sacrifice is implicit in the artha (meaning, purpose) of the sacrifice. Mimamsa school then argued that man is for the purpose of actions demanded by Vedic injunctions (apauruseya), and such subordination of man to rituals allows man to reach heaven. Other schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Vedanta schools, disagreed with Mimamsa school. They argued that rituals and sacrifice are means, not ends. Their emphasis shifted from rituals to effort and knowledge, from heaven to moksha, from freedom afterlife to freedom in this life, from human being as a cog in cosmic wheel to human being as an end in himself. For example, Aitareya Aranyaka recites: Thereafter came a flowering of the Shastraic literature on Artha and other aims of human beings: of dharma in Dharmashastras, of artha in Arthashastras, of kama in Kamashastras (Kamasutra being one part of the compendium). Different schools of Hinduism offer different perspectives on artha, just like dharma, karma and moksha. Most historical literature of ancient India from about 5th century BC and after, interlaces all four aims of humans. Many Upanishads as well as the two Indian Epics ‚Äì the Ramayana and the Mahabharata ‚Äì discuss and use the words dharma, artha, kama and moksha as part of their respective themes. Even subhasitas, gnomic and didactic Indian literature from 1st and 2nd millennium CE, incorporate artha and other three aims of human life.Ludwik Sternbach (1974), Subhasitas, Gnomic and Didactic Literature, in A History of Indian Literature Volume IV, , Otto Harrassowitz, Germany, pp. 1‚Äì76 Relative precedence between Artha, Kama and Dharma Ancient Indian literature emphasizes that dharma is foremost. If dharma is ignored, artha and kama ‚Äì profit and pleasure respectively ‚Äì lead to social chaos.Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, , pp. 16‚Äì21 The Gautama Dharmashastra, Apastamba Dharmasutra and YƒÅj√±avalkya Sm·πõti, as examples, all suggest that dharma comes first and is more important than artha and kama.See: * Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasutras - The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford University Press, , Note 24.23 at pp 364; * Gautama Dharmashastra at 1.9.46‚Äì47, Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasutras - The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford University Press, , paragraph overlapping pp 92‚Äì93; * Yajnavalkya Smrti at 1.115, Translation by Rai Vidyarnava (1918), The Sacred Books of Hindus Volume XXI, Verse CXV and commentary at pp 232; * Apastamba Dharmasutra 2.20.18‚Äì23; Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasutras - The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford University Press, , Miscellaneous Rules 18‚Äì23 at pp 64 Vatsyayana, the author of Kamasutra, recognizes relative value of three goals as follows: artha is more important and should precede kama, while dharma is more important and should precede both kama and artha. Kautiliya's Arthashastra, however, argues that artha is the foundation for the other two. Without prosperity and security in society or at an individual level, both moral life and sensuality become difficult. Poverty breeds vice and hate, while prosperity breeds virtues and love, suggested Kautiliya. Kautilya adds that all three are mutually connected, and one should not cease enjoying life, nor virtuous behavior, nor pursuit of wealth creation. Excessive pursuit of any one aspect of life with complete rejection of other two, harms all three including the one excessively pursued. SomeP.V. Kane (1941), History of Dharmashastra, Volume 2, Part 1, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp. 8‚Äì9 ancient Indian literature observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different for different people and different age groups. In a baby or child, education and kama takes precedence; in youth kama and artha take precedence; while in old age dharma takes precedence. The Epics such as the Mahabharata debate the relative precedence of dharma, artha, kama and moksha, through the different characters in Book 12, the Book of Peace.R.C. Zachner (1962), pp 115‚Äì117 Rishi Vidura says dharma must take the highest precedence. Arjuna claims without profit and prosperity (artha), people's ability for dharma and kama fall apart. Bhima claims pleasure and sex (kama) come first, because without these there is no dharma, artha or moksha. Yudhishthira asserts dharma should always lead one, including in matters of artha and kama, but then admits balancing dharma, artha and kama is often confusing and difficult. In another book, the Mahabharata suggests that morality, profit and pleasure ‚Äì dharma, artha and kama ‚Äì all three must go together for happiness: Contemporary relevance Gavin Flood suggests the concepts embedded in purushartha, which includes artha, reflect a deep understanding and insights into human nature, and of conflicts which are inevitably faced by all human beings. It is an attempt to acknowledge and encourage one to understand diversity yet seek coherence between people, rather than deny one or more aspects of human life or force a particular precept and code on people.Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, , pp 19‚Äì20W.

They are Indian perspective on the nature of human life, a perspective shared in Jain and Buddhist literature.Donald Davis Jr. (2004), Being Hindu or Being Human: A Reappraisal of the Puru·π£ƒÅrthas, International Journal of Hindu Studies, 8.1‚Äì3, pp 1‚Äì27 See also *Dharma *Kama *Moksha *Purushartha *Arthashastra *·πöta *Karma *Chaitanya Charitamrita ReferencesExternal links * Artha in various Hindu scriptures Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:Puru·π£ƒÅrthas Category:Hinduism and society ","title":"Artha"},{"id":"1638463","text":"Zalmon Libin Zalmon Libin, usually known as Z.

Miller remembered her childhood in Roxbury as being surrounded by artists. Sculptor Alexander Calder was a neighbor; so were choreographer Martha Clarke and members of the experimental dance troupe Pilobolus. Immersed in drawing, Miller was tutored by another neighbor, sculptor Philip Grausman. Miller attended Choate Rosemary Hall. In 1980, she entered Yale University to study painting and literature. Naomi Wolf was her roommate and later became a feminist author. Miller created wooden panel triptychs she described as hybrids of pictographic forms inspired, for example, by Paul Klee and a 15th-century altarpiece.Collins, Lauren (23 November 2009). \\"Metamorphosis\\", The New Yorker.

Branch target prediction is not the same as branch prediction which attempts to guess whether a conditional branch will be taken or not-taken (i.e., binary). In more parallel processor designs, as the instruction cache latency grows longer and the fetch width grows wider, branch target extraction becomes a bottleneck. The recurrence is: * Instruction cache fetches block of instructions * Instructions in block are scanned to identify branches * First predicted taken branch is identified * Target of that branch is computed * Instruction fetch restarts at branch target In machines where this recurrence takes two cycles, the machine loses one full cycle of fetch after every predicted taken branch. As predicted branches happen every 10 instructions or so, this can force a substantial drop in fetch bandwidth. Some machines with longer instruction cache latencies would have an even larger loss. To ameliorate the loss, some machines implement branch target prediction: given the address of a branch, they predict the target of that branch. A refinement of the idea predicts the start of a sequential run of instructions given the address of the start of the previous sequential run of instructions. This predictor reduces the recurrence above to: * Hash the address of the first instruction in a run * Fetch the prediction for the addresses of the targets of branches in that run of instructions * Select the address corresponding to the branch predicted taken As the predictor RAM can be 5‚Äì10% of the size of the instruction cache, the fetch happens much faster than the instruction cache fetch, and so this recurrence is much faster. If it were not fast enough, it could be parallelized, by predicting target addresses of target branches.

It involves \\"baby-training\\" children to self- soothe by allowing the child to cry for a predetermined amount of time before receiving external comfort. \\"Cry it out\\" The \\"Cry It Out\\" (CIO) approach can be traced back to the book \\"The Care and Feeding of Children\\" written by Emmett Holt in 1894.The Care and Feeding of Children: A Catechism for the Use of Mothers and Children's Nurses (1907 edition) by Dr. Holt, L. Emmett, MD CIO is any sleep-training method which allows a baby to cry for a specified period before the parent will offer comfort. \\"Ferberization\\" is one such approach. Ferber does not advocate simply leaving a baby to cry. More extreme methods, such as Marc Weissbluth's extinction method, are often mistakenly referred to as \\"Ferberization\\", though they fall outside of the guidelines Ferber recommended. Some pediatricians,Mistaken Approaches to Night Waking Excerpt from Sweet Dreams: A pediatrician's secrets for your child's good night sleep Lowell House, 22‚Äì28 By Paul M. Fleiss, MD, MPH, FAAP, 2000 however, feel that any form of CIO is unnecessary and damaging to a baby.Sears, William MD, et al., The Baby Sleep Book, Little, Brown and Company, 2005 Ferberization summarized Ferber discusses and outlines a wide range of practices to teach an infant to sleep. The term Ferberization is now popularly used to refer to the following techniques: * Take steps to prepare the baby to sleep. This includes night-time rituals and day-time activities. * At bedtime, leave the child in bed and leave the room. * Return at progressively increasing intervals to comfort the baby (without picking him or her up). For example, on the first night, some scenarios call for returning first after three minutes, then after five minutes, and thereafter each ten minutes, until the baby is asleep. * Each subsequent night, return at intervals longer than the night before. For example, the second night may call for returning first after five minutes, then after ten minutes, and thereafter each twelve minutes, until the baby is asleep. The technique is targeted at infants as young as four months of age. A few babies are capable of sleeping through the night at three months, and most are capable of sleeping through the night at six months. Before six months of age, the baby may still need to feed during the night and it is probable that the baby will require a night feeding before three months. Criticism Crying is associated with physiological stress in the baby in the short term, and some pediatricians do not recommend techniques like \\"controlled crying\\" and \\"camping out\\" as a result, based on possible long-term psychological and physical problems. A study that looked at long-term consequences in children older than seven months concluded that there were no beneficial nor negative effects. However, there are no data on children younger than seven months. National Health Service summary: * Co-sleeping is a common alternative that comes with its own risks and benefits.

History Mission house in Molepolole, 1870s Ntsweng was the capital of Bakwena before they moved to Molepolole. Ntsweng is a historic site located a few kilometers southeast of Molepolole. The area was first occupied by Bakwena, led by Sechele I (ruled 1829‚Äì92), in 1864. It was abandoned in 1937 when Bakwena were forced to move to Molepolole by Kgari II, assisted by the colonial administrators. Ntsweng today consists of a large area covered with traces of occupation. Most notable are the patterns of stones laid on their edges to form house foundations which are still visible on the surface. There are also the ruins of what used to be Sebele II's office which is at present referred to as Mmakgosi's house. The ruins of that building are situated next to an area which used to be the royal kraal at Ntsweng but is now the royal cemetery. Several clusters of ruins seem to represent different wards. Analyses of the settlement layout and soil samples suggest cattle were often kept in the center of each ward. This seems to follow the \\"central cattle pattern\\", a conceptual model for the organization of settlements among southern Bantu, where the central placement of the kraal reflects the central role of cattle in the culture and ideology of the people.

The school has an all-male enrollment of approximately 1,400 students. It is operated independently Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix. The school has three campuses: the main academic campus in north-central Phoenix at Central Avenue and Camelback Road, a retreat campus called Manresa near Sedona, and the new Brophy Sports Campus east of the academic campus in Phoenix and adjacent to the campus of the all-girls Xavier College Preparatory. Brophy has no diocesan or government financial assistance. Brophy College Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History The chapel at Brophy The school was founded in 1928 by Mrs. Henry Brophy in memory of her late husband, as a Jesuit high school that included first year college courses. The Regis Hall building (renamed Frank C. Brophy Jr. Hall in 2006), the Jesuit residence, and the chapel were completed in 1928, and the school began operating that same year as a college and high school. The Great Depression caused a major financial strain, forcing it to close in 1935. Most of the male students who previously attended Brophy transferred to another local Catholic high school, St. Mary's, which had become an all-girls school once Brophy opened. The boys brought their athletic gear from Brophy with them to St. Mary's, causing St. Mary's to change its school colors from red and white to green and white, the previous Brophy colors. In 1952, 17 years after its closing, Brophy College Preparatory reopened as a high school. It purchased used athletic equipment from Santa Clara University, whose colors were red and white, the old St. Mary's colors. This is also how they became the Brophy Broncos, adopting the Santa Clara mascot. Brophy expanded its downtown Phoenix campus by adding Loyola Hall (1959), Robson Gymnasium (1967), Keating Hall, and the Steele Library (1986). Brophy has raised capital through a major gifts campaign, which has funded the construction of the Information Commons (2001), the Eller Fine Arts Center (2003), the McCain Colonnade (2003), the Piper Center for Math and Science (2005), and the Harper Great Hall (2006). The Ethel and Kemper Marley Information Commons replaced the Steele Library as the information source on campus. In November 2002, Brophy acquired the former Phoenix Swim Club for $1.6 million to use as a sports campus. It was called the Dottie Boreyko/Brophy East Swim Campus. The facilities of this campus included two outdoor swimming pools (one of them Olympic-sized and equipped with two underwater viewing rooms), a 400-meter training track, a soccer field, a running track, and locker rooms. In 2013, Brophy sold the Brophy Swim Campus to Ryland Homes, and it was vacated in early 2014. The school built a pool at its main campus, with further financial assistance from the Class of 2016. In 2010, Brophy completed construction on its Brophy Sports Campus, which has a synthetic turf field and a natural turf practice field. The completion of this campus marks the first phase of upgrading all of the school's athletic facilities. In 2016, Brophy completed ‚Äúthe Dutch‚Äù, a multi-functional gymnasium complete with a basketball court, running track, and underground gym. Academics Brophy Prep is the only Jesuit high school in Arizona. Its curriculum relies on a combination of liberal arts principles and Roman Catholic theology. Honors and advanced placement sections exist in each of the curricular disciplines, including 33 advanced placement classes. Students may also take classes at Xavier College Preparatory, a Catholic girls' college preparatory school adjacent to Brophy. Admission is based on grades, an entrance exam, essays, and a required interview. For the 2013‚Äì14 academic year, Brophy's annual tuition was $13,500; financial assistance was available for those who qualified. Tablet program In the 2006‚Äì07 academic year, Brophy implemented the Tablet PC program for all incoming freshmen. Under the mandatory program, students must buy a Lenovo Tablet PC, a laptop on which the user can both type and write. Because the tablet allows students to keep their books in one place, the program has resolved complaints about having to carry books around. The policies of some publishing companies regarding digital textbooks have not allowed Brophy to become completely \\"bookless\\". As of the 2009‚Äì2010 academic year, the school completed its Tablet conversion, and all students now participate in the program. In 2012 the school announced that starting with the class of 2016 the Lenovos would be replaced by Apple iPads. Starting with the class of 2021, students would now have MacBook Air laptops over the Apple iPads that were previously used. To support the PCs, the entire campus has been retrofitted with wi-fi access points in most classrooms and in all buildings. The school administration plans to continue the program and work toward a paper-free campus. Athletics Brophy fields 26 teams in 12 sports, competing in Region 6 of Arizona's Class 6A Division. Sports Illustrated has ranked Brophy's athletic programs among the top 25 in the nation. As of 2019, the swim team has won 32 consecutive state titles in addition to producing several Olympic medalists. In 2005, the Brophy swim team won the national high school championship. Brophy football won the 2005 and 2007 5A-I Football State Championship. The 2005 football team finished ranked 3rd in the West and 21st in the nation by USA Today and ranked 23rd in the country by Sports Illustrated. The baseball and volleyball programs also took state championships in 2006. In the 2007‚Äì2008 season, the Brophy Bronco Soccer Team won the 5A-1 State Championship and finished the season ranked no. 2 on the west coast and no. 8 in the nation. During the 2010‚Äì2011 season, the Brophy soccer team won its second 5A-1 State Championship in four years, ending the season as national runners-up. Brophy Soccer won the state title in Division 1 in 2014 and 2015 and was runner-up in 2012. Brophy took home the 5A-1 state title in their 2019-2020 season and ended their season ranked 13 in the nation. The Brophy lacrosse team has won the Arizona Division I State Championship five times, in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. Brophy is one of three high schools in Arizona that has a rowing team. They have rowed at the Head of the Charles regatta. They compete in the South West Junior region. They won the 2011, 2012, and 2013 Arizona State Junior Rowing Championships. In the 2010‚Äì2011 year, Brophy added a rugby club team, the Brophy College Preparatory Rugby Football Club, becoming one of only a few schools in the state to sponsor its own rugby team. In 2012 Brophy won the 5A Varsity Hockey Championship for the first time. The Brophy tennis team won state championships this decade in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018. Student life Brophy's Student Council, as well as over 90 student-led clubs and organizations, regularly coordinate activities that involve the entire student body.Students feel economic pinch In 2008, 2009, and 2012 Brophy sent teams to the National Science Bowl competition. The basketball cheering section, known as the 6th Man, has been compared by Arizona sportswriters to the famous Cameron Crazies of Duke University.

Function during development As the scrotum and labia majora form in males and females respectively, the gubernaculum aids in the descent of the gonads (both testes and ovaries). The testes descend to a greater degree than the ovaries and ultimately pass through the inguinal canal. Adult structures The gubernaculum is present only during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs, being replaced by distinct vestiges in males and females. =Males= In males: * The upper part of the gubernaculum degenerates. * The lower part persists as the gubernaculum testis (\\"scrotal ligament\\"). This ligament secures the testis to the most inferior portion of the scrotum, tethering it in place and limiting the degree to which the testis can move within the scrotum. * Cryptorchidism (undescended testes) are observed in Insl3-null male mice. This implicates Insl3 as a key hormone in the growth and differentiation of the gubernaculum to allow transabdominal migration. Higher testicular temperatures associated with cryptorchidism is associated with reduced fertility.Nef and Parada, Nat Genet 1999, 22, 295-299 =Females= In females: * The gubernaculum has two vestigial remnants in females, the ovarian ligament and the round ligament of the uterus (ligamentum teres uteri) which respectively serve to support the ovaries and uterus in the pelvis. * Development of the gubernaculum in female mice overexpressing Insl3 causes descended ovaries and reduced fertility. This ovarian descent is more pronounced by the additional administration of dihydrotestosterone, which suppresses development of the cranial suspensory ligament. Therefore, maintenance of the cranial suspensory ligament prevents abdominal translocation of the ovaries.Adham et al., Mol Endocrinol 2002, 16, 244-252 See also * Canal of Nuck ReferencesExternal links * - \\"Inguinal Region, Scrotum and Testes: The Scrotal Ligament\\" Category:Abdomen Category:Embryology of urogenital system ","title":"Gubernaculum"},{"id":"1638532","text":"Brophy is an Irish surname of ancient origin, which is derived from the Irish \\"U√≠ Bhr√≥ithe\\" or \\"√ì Br√≥ithe\\" septs that were located mostly around Ballybrophy, Laois, and in counties Carlow and Kilkenny. The family has been prominent in the history of Ireland for nearly 1000 years and has included petty kings (R√≠), clerics, soldiers, and writers. The family was first mentioned in the late 11th century, but as a member of the D√°l Birn dynasty, its semi-legendary genealogy stretches back to AD 200 according to the Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B 502. As such, it remains one of Ireland's oldest extant pre-Norman Conquest noble families. The ancestral seat of the family chief became Ballybrophy (historically Ballybrohy, from Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records)A. D. Mills, 2003, A Dictionary of British Place-Names, Oxford University Press) after the Norman Invasion of Ireland in the 12th century. Giolla na Naomh √ì hUidhr√≠n wrote in the 14th century that the earliest ancestor of the Brophys was Sedna, the great- grandson of the semi-legendary pre-Christian founder of the Kingdom of Ossory, √ìengus Osrithe. In The Book of Rights, the Osraige are labelled as S√≠l mBresail Bric (\\"the seed of Bresail Bric\\") after Bressail Bricc, a remote ancestor of the Ossorians. Bressail Bricc had two sons; Lughaidh, ancestor of the Laigan, and Connla, from whom the Ossorians sprang, through √ìengus Osrithe.Genealogies from Rawlinson B 502Keating Thus, the people of Osraige were also sometimes collectively referred to as Clann Connla.The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (FA4) found online through UCC CELT \\"The Annals of the Four Masters\\" records the death of Gilla Molua O'Brophy (Ua Bruaidheada) of Rath Tamnaighe (Lisdowney, Kilkenny) in 1069. The \\"Annals of Ulster\\" mentions that Connor O'Brophy (Conchobar Ua Broighthe), King of Ceann Chaille, and Domhnall Mac Gilla Patraic, King of Upper Ossory, were slain by the O'Moores in 1165. Giolla na Naomh √ì hUidhr√≠n mentions the O'Brophys as residing in Magh Sedna (the Plain of Sedna) in the barony of Galmoy (barony), Kilkenny in his 14th century work, \\"Tuilleadh feasa ar √âirinn √≥igh.\\" The name of Galmoy (barony), in Irish Gabhalmhaigh, means \\"plain of the Branch, or Ghabhal\\" (River Goul). Magh Sedna is a fertile part of Ireland which the Danes invaded in the ninth century, and where the Normans came after they had conquered Britain in the eleventh century. Over the years the Norse, Norman and Gaelic bloods have mingled in the families of later centuries. It is the paradoxical story of Ireland that the conquered frequently absorbed their conquerors through intermarriage, language and customs. Hence the oppressors of one generation often produced the rebels of a later one. William O'Brothe was appointed Prior of the Augustinian Monastery of St. Tigernacius of Aghamacart by Pope Sixtus IV on 31 March 1481.Letters of simple and unlimited protection for the Prior and canons of Fertackerach and Ackidmacarth in Ireland William is likely to have been the illegitimate son of Philip O'Brothe, Abbot of Kilcooley Abbey, whom Pope Pius II legitimised and instructed to be taken on as a monk at the Abby after his father's death.\\"Vatican Regesta 496: 1463‚Äì1464\\", in Calendar of Papal Registers Relating To Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 11, 1455‚Äì1464, ed.

When Florence Fitzpatrick, 3rd Baron Upper Ossory, the son of the last person to have claim to the kingship of Osraige, was pardoned by Queen Elizabeth I in 1601, his kinsmen, the Brophys and other \\"old tribesman of Upper Ossory,\\" were also mentioned in the pardon. Ui Broithe was anglicised as O'Broghie in the Patent Rolls of James I in 1603 and 1607. The name appears as Brohy in census of 1659. Their territory comprised the level portion of the barony of Galmoy, in the county of Kilkenny. They were driven from the plain of Magh Sedna into Upper Ossory, after the Norman invasion of Ireland, and their chief settled at Ballybrophy, near Borris-in-Ossory, in Queen's County (now County Laois).

It is the only religious building of Raphael which has been preserved in its near original form. The chapel is a treasure trove of Italian Renaissance and Baroque art and is ranked among the most important monuments in the basilica. History Raphael's ground plan, c. 1512 In 1507 Julius II granted assent to the acquisition of a chapel in the church to his friend, the wealthy Sienese banker and financier of the Roman Curia, Agostino Chigi. Chigi had bought the second chapel in the north aisle, and its dedication was changed by a papal bull on 3 December 1507 from Saints Sebastian, Roch and Sigismund to the Madonna of Loreto, whose shrine Agostino was passionately devoted, and Saints Augustine and Sebastian. The bull also stated that the chapel was meant to be a mausoleum for Agostino and his heirs, \\"wishing to trade earthly things to heavenly and transitory to eternal by fortunate exchange.\\"Giuseppe Cugnoni: Note al Commentario di Alessandro VII sulla vita di Agostino Chigi, in Archivio della Societa Romana di Storia Patria Vol. 3, 1880, p. 441 The chapel was most probably rebuilt from scratch with Raphael as the architect. A ground plan attributed to the artist was preserved in the Uffizi in Florence, it was presumably drawn at the beginning of the work around 1512. An inscription on the dome marked the completion of the mosaics in 1516. In the following years Lorenzetto worked on the architectural decoration of the chapel and the statues under Raphael's patronage. The main iconographic theme of the chapel was the Resurrection; and visually it represented a marriage between Christianity and classical antiquity.Marcia B. Hall, cit., pag. 131-132. Agostino Chigi was buried in the half-finished chapel on 11 April 1520, and Raphael himself had died a few days before Agostino. Agostino Chigi's widow, Francesca Ordeasca commissioned the mosaicist, Luigi da Pace on 31 May 1520 to create another set of mosaics for the planned decoration of the tambour and the spandrels, but she died in the same year on 11 November. The simultaneous death of the artist, the patron and the patron's widow stymied work on the chapel. Agostino's younger brother, Sigismondo Chigi commissioned Lorenzetto to go on with Raphael's plan in 1521.Norbert Walther Nobis: Lorenzetto als Bildhauer, 1979, Bonn, pp. 72-73 But the work advanced slowly and the death of Sigismondo in 1526 left everything in limbo. Vasari records in his Lives, speaking about the statues of Jonah and Elijah: > \\"... the heirs of Agostino, with scant respect, allowed these figures to > remain in Lorenzetto's workshop where they stood for many years. [...] > Lorenzo, robbed for those reasons of all hope, found for the present that he > had thrown away his time and labor.\\" Drawing from the workshop of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, c. 1655The main altar- piece, a mural depicting the birth of the Virgin by Sebastiano del Piombo was begun in 1530 but it was left unfinished in 1534. Work on the chapel resumed in 1548 when Francesco Salviati was commissioned to create frescoes on the drum and the spandrels, although Raphael intended mosaics on these surfaces. He also completed the mural above the main altar. In 1552 Lorenzo Chigi paid his debt towards the heirs of Lorenzetto, and the two statues were finally placed in the chapel. After this the chapel was unveiled for the first time in 1554.John Shearman: The Chigi Chapel in S. Maria del Popolo, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 24, No. 3/4 (Jul. - Dec., 1961) After Lorenzo Chigi's death and his burial in the chapel in 1573 the family disappeared from Rome, and their chapel became abandoned. In 1624 the funeral monument of Cardinal Antoniotto Pallavicini was moved into the chapel from the crossing and placed in front of the left wall by the friars. Sigismondo Chigi's great-grandson, Fabio made his first visit to the neglected chapel in 1626. He found it in a state of serious disrepair and complained about the presence of the Pallavicini monument in a letter to his uncle. (Later he managed to transfer this tomb to the nearby baptistery but it was still in the chapel in 1629.) Fabio Chigi regained the ownership after a three year long litigation with the Augustinians. Although the debate was settled in 1629, due to Chigi's long absence from Rome as he pursued his ecclesiastical career, the chapel remained neglected in the next decades. More important changes were carried out by Gian Lorenzo Bernini between 1652 and 1655. The works began in earnest when Fabio Chigi became cardinal-priest of the basilica. Bernini finished the pyramids, laid the present floor, raised the altar, slightly enlarged the windows, renewed the lead roof, regilded and cleaned the dome. Painted wood panels by Raffaello Vanni were placed in the lunettes above the tombs. In 1656 and in 1661 Bernini filled the remaining niches with two new statues, depicting Daniel and the Lion and Habakuk and the Angel. Another restoration campaign was launched in 1682-88. Description Exterior view of the upper part of the chapel behind the city wall. Exterior The exterior of the chapel is very simple: an oblong cube of exposed brick, surmounted by a cylindric tambour pierced with large rectangular windows. The cube is finished with a stone cornice while the tambour is decorated with a brick modillion trim. The low conical roof is covered with tiles but originally it was leaded. The dome is crowned by a small stone lanternino which has niches instead of windows between Tuscan pilasters and its base is decorated with four scrolls. This miniature round temple is topped with the symbols of the Chigi family, the mountains and the star with a cross. The exterior is practically invisible due to the location of the chapel behind the city wall, the Porta del Popolo and the main body of the basilica. Its simplicity and severe appearance was based on the reception of ancient Roman central-plan buildings for example the Temple of Minerva Medica. Interior Raphael's centralized plan was inspired by the designs of Bramante for the new St. Peter's Basilica. Another source of inspiration was the Pantheon with its dome, marble revetments and Corinthian pilasters. The simple cube is surmounted by a hemispherical dome resting on a high drum which is penetrated by a row of windows that allow light into the chapel. The trapezoidal pendentives were the characteristics of Bramante but the whole conception of space, which requires the viewer to look at from several points of view to capture its splendor, is new and unique. The side walls are made up of round-headed arches, of which only the entrance arch is open, the others are blind; they are alternated with canted corners in which shell-headed niches are framed between Corinthian pilasters. The subtle use of coloured marbles emphasizes the individual elements of the classical architecture. The soffit of the portalThe portal of the chapel is a Renaissance reinterpretation of the entrance bay of the Pantheon. It has a monumental effect with double transverse arches resting on huge Corinthian pilasters. The marble pilasters have cable-fluted shafts and beautifully carved, vivacious capitals which were practically copied from the much admired classical model. Raphael had studied the ancient building and created a precise architectural drawing of the entrance which is now preserved in the Uffizi.Paul Joannides: The Drawings of Raphael, University of California Press, 1983, p. 181 The entablature and the cornice is decorated with egg-and- dart, bead-and-reel and flower-patterned enrichments. The pilasters are of polished white Carrara marble with faint grey veins while the capitals are of unpolished pure white Carrara marble. The surfaces between the pilasters are covered with a coloured marble revetment, their slabs divided by white marble panels. The giallo antico and portasanta marble balustradeThe surfaces of the arches are decorated with Renaissance ornaments; on the intrados of the outer arch there is a meander, the archivolt of the inner arch is decorated with rich garlands of fruit and a mask, while the intrados of the inner arch has a central band of alternating rosettes and rectangles with grotesques, framed by two interlacement bands with six-pointed stars in the middle. The stucco Chigi coat-of-arms (quartered with the oak and the six mountain with the star) above the portal was added by Bernini in 1652.Cecilia Magnusson: Lorenzetto's statue of Jonah, and the Chigi chapel in S. Maria del Popolo, Konsthistorisk Tidskrift, 56:1, 1987, p. 24 The inscription \\"Unum ex septem\\" on the cartouche hanging from the coat-of-arms indicates that this is one of the privileged altars which are devotionally equivalent to visiting the Seven Churches of Rome. The entrance of the chapel is marked by a marble railing. It is made of a yellow giallo antico marble frame with dark red portasanta balusters. The railing was enlarged and the turgid balusters were added in the 17th century. This balustrade was copied by Giovanni Battista Contini in the Elci Chapel in Santa Sabina using a different colour scheme. The step leading into the chapel is a large monolith of Egyptian granite. All the other chapels in the basilica have simple white stone steps.Lex Bosman: Spolia and Coloured Marble in Sepulchral Monuments in Rone, Florence and Bosco Marengo, in: Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz, 49. Bd., H. 3 (2005), pp. 353-354 and p. 373 Agostino Chigi paid 300 scudi for the large block of stone. The central panels of the wooden doors are decorated with a dense foliage of carved acanthus leaves. The panel with the male head.The friezes in the chapel are \\"dropped\\" in an odd position between the capitals. This was an uncommon device and Raphael gave it an entirely new significance with the exuberance and plasticity of the carvings. There are similar dropped friezes on the Santa Casa in Loreto designed by Bramante in 1509. Shearman supposed that the design for the Chigi Chapel preceded the Santa Casa; at any rate the two project were related because the Chigi Chapel was dedicated to the Virgin of Loreto by Agostino Chigi. Dropped friezes appear on the two monumental tombs by Andrea Sansovino in the apse of the basilica which were also created in the first decade of the 16th century. The antique precedents are rare but the same arrangement is visible on the Arcus Argentariorum in Rome. The friezes are embellished with festoons of fruit and ribbons. The decoration was modelled after the relief panels in the entrance bay of the Pantheon that Raphael recorded on a smaller drawing but he omitted the tripods on the sides because the available space was smaller. Raphael also added new symbols above the festoons: ascending eagles (at the sides of the altar), a bearded male head wearing a hat in the form of the Chigi symbols with two fantastic beasts (right to the entrance), a siren attended by winged sealions (left to the entrance) and the Chigi symbol of the mountain and the eight-pointed star (under the entrance arch). There are playful details: flowers and berries at the end of the ribbons, birds pecking the fruits of the festoons (both eagle panels) and a small scene of a bird attacking a lizard which is nibbling the fruits (left eagle panel). There is a circular crypt under the chapel with an unornamented, empty pyramidal tomb set in the wall right under the altar which was discovered in 1974.Christoph Luitpold Frommel: Das Hypog√§um Raffaels unter der Chigikapelle in S. Maria del Popolo zu Rom, In: Kunstchronik vol. 27 (1974) p. 344-348 At present this hypogeum is totally hidden from view but before Bernini's reconstruction there was an aperture in front of the altar creating a visual link between the two levels. Dome The dome with the mosaics of Raphael.The dome is decorated with mosaics executed by the Venetian Luigi da Pace after Raphael's cartoon (1516). The original cartoons were lost but some preparatory drawings, that confirm the originality of the work, survived in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford and Lille. The central roundel represents God, the Father, surrounded by putti, effectively foreshortened in an impetuous gesture, harking back to Michelangelo, which seems to give rise to the entire motion of the universe below. Eight mosaic panels show the Sun, the Moon, the starry sky and the six known planets as pagan deities depicted in half-length, each accompanied by an angel with colourful feathered wings. The figures are accompanied by the signs of the zodiac. Luna, engraving of a mosaic panel by Nicolas Dorigny.The sequence of the panels is as follows: the sky; Mercury, the god holding the caduceus (with Virgo and Gemini); Luna, the crescent moon jewelled goddess holding a bow (with Cancer); Saturn, the bearded god holding the scythe (with Aquarius and Capricorn); Jupiter, the king of the gods with his eagle holding a thunderbolt (with Sagittarius and Pisces); Mars, the god of war holding a sword and a shield (with Scorpio and Aries); Sol, the sun jewelled god holding a bow (with Leo); Venus, the goddess of love with Cupid holding a torch (with Taurus and Libra). A French engraver, Nicolas Dorigny created a series of plates depicting the mosaics in 1695 for Louis, Duke of Burgundy. The mosaic panels are surrounded by richly gilded stucco decoration. The blue background creates an optical illusion giving the impression of an architectural framework opening to the sky above the chapel. The panels look like illusionistic skylights between the gilt stucco ribs while God is standing on the edge of the central oculus. The traditional interpretation of the dome is that the composition shows the Creation of the World. Another interpretation, proposed by John Shearman, claims that it represents the cosmos as described by Plato in a Christianized Neoplatonist form. This idea had a widespread popularity in the Renaissance. In this case the dome is a depiction of the \\"Realm of the Soul after Death\\" with God, the Father recepting the soul (of Agostino Chigi) in his new home. The presence of the signs of the zodiac corroborates this interpretation because the signs were symbols of the passage of time in eternity, and they appeared in antique funeral art around the image of the departed. Tambour and spandrels The personification of WinterRaphael intended mosaics for the decoration of the tambour and the spandrels but these were never executed. In 1520 Francesca Ordeasca commissioned Luigi da Pace to carry out this task in no more than four years. In 1530 the executors of Agostino Chigi's will commissioned Sebastiano del Piombo to produce eight oil murals between the windows and four tondi on the spandrels. As Sebastiano was working leisurely on the large altar-piece, he made only preparatory drawings. Two studies in the Louvre show God the Father creating the Sun and the Moon and separating Light from Darkness. Another drawing in the Royal Library in Windsor shows God with arms outstretched, a gesture associated with creation. The drawings were obviously inspired by Michelangelo. Around 1548-50 the Chigis commissioned Francesco de' Rossi (or Il Salviati) with the same task. Supposedly de' Rossi was recommended by his patron, Cardinal Giovanni Salviati (whose surname he adopted) because the cardinal was linked to the Chigi family through the 1530 marriage of his relative, Giuliano with Camilla Chigi, the daughter of Agostino.Philippe Costamagna: Le m√©c√©nat et la politique culturelle du cardinal Giovanni Salviati, in: Francesco Salviati et la Bella Maniera. √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 2001, p. 247 The four tondi of the spandrels depict allegoric representations of the Seasons. In 1653 they were restored by Antonio della Cornia by order of Fabio Chigi. The murals were described as being seriously damaged in 1842.Ernst Platner et al.: Beschreibung der Stadt Rom, Stuttgart and T√ºbingen, J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung, 1842, III., p. 221 The iconography of the paintings is classical. Spring is represented as a young woman holding a bouquet of flowers with a floral wreath on her head; Summer is a woman holding ears of grain with a wreath of wheat on her head; Autumn is a young man under a grapevine with a cup; and Winter is an old man in a fur hat warming his hands by a brazier. A small ram by the shoulder of Spring is a symbol of Aries, the first sign of the zodiac and connected to the vernal equinox. The portrayal of Ver (Spring), Aestas (Summer) and Autumnus (Autumn) follows Ovid's description of the seasons in his Metamorphoses (Met 2.27-30) while the allegory of winter was inspired by the \\"February-by-the- fire\\" motif of medieval calendar tradition. The former three personifications can also be interpreted as ancient Roman deities: Flora/Proserpina, Ceres and Bacchus. The tondi were damaged in different degrees, the most seriously the allegory of Autumn. During a recent restoration the 17th-century bronze frames were removed. {style=\\"background:lightgray; border:1px solid dimgray;color:white\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"The Genesis-cycle -align=\\"center\\" none none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\" Separation of Light from Darkness width=\\"100\\"Creation of the Sun and the Moon width=\\"100\\"Creation of the Earth width=\\"100\\"Creation of Adam } The frescos between the windows of the drum (c. 1552-1554) depict scenes from the Book of Genesis in order: Separation of Light from Darkness, Creation of the Sun and the Moon, Creation of the Earth, Creation of Adam, Creation of Eve, Creation of the Animals, The Original Sin and Expulsion from Paradise. The paintings show the strong influence of the sculptural style of Michelangelo's famous Genesis-cycle on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.Catherine Dumont: Francesco Salviati au Palais Sacchetti de Rome et la d√©coration murale italienne, Institut suisse de Rome, 1973, p. 146 The scenes are not in strictly chronological order. The first five are the same as the parallel Genesis paintings in the Sistine Chapel but the sixth fresco adds a new subject, the creation of the fishes, birds and wild animals. The sixth scene of the Sistine ceiling is separated into two individual paintings on the drum of the Chigi Chapel. Salviati's cycle ends here, and the three scenes from the story of Noah, that make up the last section of Michelangelo's great sequence, are missing. Around 1602 Vincenzo I Gonzaga, the Duke of Mantua commissioned Pietro Facchetti to make copies of the Genesis frescos and the cosmological mosaics of the dome. The oil paintings were gifts to the Duke of Lerma, the most influential man in the court of Philip III of Spain, and they were brought to Valladolid in 1603 together with other copies of famous Italian artworks by Peter Paul Rubens, a young Flemish painter working for Duke Vincenzo at the time. The zodiac paintings later went to decorate the Planetary Hall of Philip IV of Spain in the Buen Retiro Palace. At present seven of the zodiac paintings and five surviving copies of the Genesis frescos are located in the Museo del Prado.Pilar Gonz√°lez Serrano: Mitolog√≠a e Iconograf√≠a en la Pintura del Museo del Prado, Ediciones Evoh√©, Madrid, 2009. pp. 294-296 Due to their location and bad visibility the Salviati frescos have always been somewhat overlooked but the copies sent for the Duke of Lerma prove that they were held in high esteem at the time. This fact is corroborated by the 1725 guide of Roma sacra e moderna. {style=\\"background:lightgray; border:1px solid dimgray;color:white\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"The Genesis-cycle -align=\\"center\\" none none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\" Creation of Eve width=\\"100\\"Creation of the Animals width=\\"100\\"The Original Sin width=\\"100\\"Expulsion from Paradise } \\"The architectural circularity of the tambour is evidently suitable for the narration of the story about the creation of the world in six days. The scenes require the viewer to move his gaze along the wall of the drum, and it is only at the end of this visual journey that he has reconstructed the story in its entirety\\", claims Florian M√©tral.Florian M√©tral: \\"Au commencement √©tait la fin : Retour sur la chapelle Chigi de Santa Maria del Popolo √† Rome\\", Studiolo, 12, 2015 (2016), p. 164 The windows also play their part in the overall effect because the sunlight breaks through each of the bays in turn, illuminating certain scenes and making others indiscernible, thus modulating the viewer's visual experience over time. The scene of the Creation of the Animals poses an interesting problem due to its placement after the creation of Adam and Eve which is not consistent with the Biblical narrative and has no iconographic precedent. (The aquatic and flying animals were created by God on the fifth day while the terrestrial species had been created on the sixth day but before the first man.) Salviati \\"postponed\\" this scene in order to place the Creation of Adam and the Creation of Eve on both sides of the entrance to the chapel and to have them face directly the Nativity of the Virgin on the altar because this arrangement was more meaningful theologically. A subtle reference that the scene belongs to the first group could be seen in the treatment of God's clothing (red and blue mantle in the first scenes but a different bluish-white robe in the Creation of Adam and Eve). Looking at the whole cycle the scenes are gradually getting darker as the narrative progresses, except the oddly positioned Creation of the Animals which belongs to the first group of paintings regarding its treatment of light. According to M√©tral the frescos of the tambour represent the creation of the terrestrial and visible world, subject to time (tempus), which is marked by mutability and corruptibility in contrast with the perfect and eternal world of heaven represented by the mosaics of the dome above. Sebastiano del Piombo: Birth of the Virgin The Birth of the Virgin by Sebastiano del PiomboJohn Shearman proposed that the main altar-piece was intended to be an Assumption of the Virgin but the theory remains heavily disputed. Soon after Raphael died, Sebastiano del Piombo was chosen to carry on the work on the altar-piece but he achieved less than expected. Vasari gives a scathing account in his Lives: > \\"He did little work there, although we find that he obtained from the > liberality of Agostino and his heirs much more than would have been due to > him even if he had finished it completely, which he did not do, either > because he was weary of the labors of art, or because he was too much > wrapped up in comforts and pleasures.\\" During this decade Sebastiano may have produced several drafts to the patrons. Two of them survived: an earlier preparatory study in the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin and a finely executed, definitive modello drawing in the Louvre. The main difference is that the group in the upper part of the painting (God and angels) is missing on the earlier Berlin drawing. The composition of the modello, which is identical to the executed mural, became more mature and harmonious. (Another study, a small drawing of a female head, was acquired by the Louvre in 2004.) On 1 August 1530 Filippo Sergardi, who was guardian to the heirs of Agostino Chigi, signed a new contract with Sebastiano accepting the final version. In this document the artist was entrusted to paint the altar-piece and the other murals in the next three years for a compensation of 1500 plus 1300 gold ducats.Constanza Barbieri: La Nativita della Vergine di Sebastiano del Piombo nel contesto della Cappella Chigi, in Santa Maria del Popolo. Storia e restauri, 2009, pp. 480-488 The Birth of the Virgin was eventually begun by Sebastiano del Piombo using an unusual technique, oil on peperino stone blocks. This was invented by him and greatly admired by his contemporaries. The mural was left unfinished by Sebastiano in 1534 and it was completed by Francesco Salviati by 1554. The upper part with the figure of the Holy Father and the angels is mainly Salviati's work.Antonio Mu√±oz, cit., pag. 384. The iconography of the painting is rather unusual. According to Costanza Barbieri the presence of God in the upper part combines the traditional subject of the nativity with the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception which was still not generally accepted but it was heavily promoted by Pope Sixtus IV, and by Agostini Chigi, who requested in his will the celebration of a solemn mass in his chapel on the day of the birth of the Virgin. The theological stance of sine culpa was also shared by the Augustinian friars of Santa Maria del Popolo. The idea that Mary, mother of Jesus can be stained by the original sin is abhorrent for God, the Father who averts this risk with his strong gesture even before Mary is conceived. The angels surrounding the Holy Father are angeli apteri, angels without wings, young men after the fashion of Michelangelo. They are intently browsing voluminous codices turning to the right and the left, an appropriate visualization of the sapiential books; the same motif appears on a modello drawing by Sebastiano for an altar- piece depicting the Assumption in the Rijksmuseum. In the lower part of the painting the newborn baby is prepared for her first bath by seven female servants. The woman holding the baby in the middle bears some deceptive - and probably intentional - resemblance to a Madonna. Saint Anne, who just gave birth to her daughter, is resting on the bed in the middle of the gloomy room which opens towards a courtyard. In the strongly lit rectangle of the doorway her husband, Joachim is greeted by a man. At the far end of the rather monumental courtyard a classical statue is visible, probably representing the Tiburtine Sibyl who prophesied the birth of Christ to Augustus. The ornate gilded bronze frame of the painting with acanthus leaves and acorns was made by Francuccio Francucci in 1655. Similar frames surround the lunette panels of Raffaello Vanni above the tombs. Christ and the Samaritan Woman Christ and the Samaritan Woman, bronze relief antependium by Lorenzetto The bronze bas-relief panel on the altar front is Christ and the Samaritan Woman, by Lorenzetto. The relief was made in the early 1520s and bought by Lorenzo Chigi from the heirs of the sculptor in 1552. According to Antonio Pinelli it was originally planned for the tomb of Francesca Ordeasca, the wife of Agostino Chigi. If true, then this offers an explanation for the unusual thematic choice that suits well to a female tomb but seems somewhat incongruous on the sepulchre of a man. Anyway it was placed on the only existing pyramid at the time, the tomb of Agostino Chigi, and later it was moved to the main altar by Bernini who set it into a luminous golden-yellow stone frame. The relief depicts the meeting of Jesus and the Samaritan woman at Jacob's Well. The relevant part of the passage in the Gospel of John (John 4:10‚Äì26) is called the Water of Life Discourse, and Jesus' words make it clear why the imagery was appropriate on a tomb: ‚Äò...those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.‚Äô Lorenzetto chose to represent the second part of the episode. Jesus is sitting at the well under a tree, and the disciples are offering him food that they bought in the town nearby. On the left the Samaritan woman is guiding the inhabitants of Sychar towards the well to see the Messiah. The figures, the Samaritan woman and the second woman on the left were copied from a famous antique marble relief called the \\"Borghese Dancers\\" that is now kept in the Louvre but originally it was in Rome, and was an important source of inspiration for the artistic circle around Raphael.Emanuele Loewy: Di alcune composizioni di Raffaello, Roma, Typografia dell'Unione cooperatura editrice, 1896, pp. 248-51 The four prophets Part of the statue of Daniel by Bernini The statues of the prophets standing in identical shell-headed niches in the four corners of the chapel belong to two distinct groups. The first two (Jonah and Elijah) were created by Lorenzetto following the designs of Raphael. These were left in the workshop of the sculptor until the Chigis bought them from Lorenzetto's heirs, and they were put up in the chapel in 1552. The latter two (Daniel and Habakkuk) were added by Bernini during the 17th century reconstruction. There are differing theories on the arrangement of the niche figures in the original plans. Shearman assumed that the statue of Jonah was planned for the niche to the right of the altar because this place offered the best angle to view the composition. He thought that the statue of Elijah was most likely intended for one of the two niches by the entrance. After 1552 the two statues were supposedly placed on the two sides of the entrance. The present arrangement was created by Bernini who placed the statues of Habakkuk and Daniel diagonally facing each other creating a coherent composition. The statue of Jonah and the whale, a prophet who prefigured the Resurrection, was carved by Lorenzetto (1520). The statue of Elijah, who lived by the grace of God in the desert, was created by Lorenzetto but it was finished by Raffaello da Montelupo around 1523/24. In two other niches are sculptures by Bernini: Habakkuk and the Angel (1656‚Äì61) that took him by the hair and transported him to Babylon to succour Daniel and the Lion, who is represented in the corresponding niche on the opposite wall, sculpted by Bernini in 1655-56. With these two statues Bernini created a spatial relationship that enlivened the entire chapel, turning its classical form to a new religious use. Pyramids Salviati's drawing depicting Agostino's pyramid in its original or planned form.On the side walls are the matching pyramidal wall tombs of Agostino Chigi (died 1520) and his brother Sigismondo (died 1526), each represented in a medallion, looking towards the altar. The monuments were probably designed by Raphael but their execution was left to Lorenzetto who nearly finished one tomb in 1522. As for the other pyramid, the evidences are inconclusive. The pentimenti at the marble cornices suggest that originally only one pyramid for the eastern side was envisaged. The first time when \\"sepulchres\\" are mentioned in plural form is in a contract between the Chigi family and Bernardino da Viterbo on 8 April 1522 when the sculptor was commissioned to add the final touches to Lorenzetto's work. Nonetheless the other pyramid was still recorded as mostly unbuilt in 1552 when the Chigis paid their long-standing debt towards Lorenzetto's family. (In the proceedings the base of the second pyramid and the slabs for the marble covering were also duly recorded.)Domenico Gnoli: La sepoltura d'Agostino Chigi nella Chiesa di S. Maria del Popolo in Roma, in Archivio Storico dell'Arte, II (1889), pp. 318-320 Most probably the second monument was only erected by Fabio Chigi for his great-grandfather, Sigismondo.Nicole Riegel: Die Chigi-Kapelle in Santa Maria del Popolo. Eine kritische Revision, Marburger Jahrbuch f√ºr Kunstwissenschaft, 30. Bd. (2003), pp. 100-101 In 1996 Antonio Pinelli discovered the original 1552 contract in the Getty Research Institute which had only been known through an inaccurate 19th-century transcription. He interpreted the text as a proof that the pyramid of Agostino was originally planned for his wife, Francesca Ordeasca together with the bronze relief of Christ and the Samaritan woman.Antonio Pinelli: La cappella delle tombe scambiate. Novit√† sulla Cappella Chigi in Santa Maria del Popolo, in: Francesco Salviati et la Bella Maniera. √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 2001, pp. 253-284 This theory remains disputed but the corrected text indeed speaks about a female tondo which had not been executed by Lorenzetto - a hint that the second pyramid was prepared for a woman, most probably Ordeasca. Pyramidal tombs were a new invention at the time but pyramids were the traditional symbols of eternity and immortality. The Chigi tombs were inspired by antique sources because they recalled the tombs of the pharaohs and two famous Roman funeral monuments, the pyramids of Cestius and Romulus, and due to their slender, elongated form (the ratio to height to width in Santa Maria del Popolo is 2:1), the ancient Egyptian obelisks embellishing the squares of the city. Obelisks were also associated with Roman imperial funerals because medieval tradition held that the bronze globe on top of the Vatican obelisk contained the ashes of Julius Caesar. The portrait of Sigismondo Chigi by BerniniDuring the Baroque reconstruction of the chapel, the tombs were finished and simplified by Bernini. Originally the medallions were probably made of bronze, the epitaphs were to be written on gilt copper plates, and three sides of the bases were to be decorated with bronze reliefs. A sketch attributed to Giovanni Antonio Dosio (c. 1570) in the Uffizi shows the original form of Agostino's pyramid with the plate and the medallion missing. Another drawing, an architectural phantasy with the figures of Pyramus and Thisbe by Jean Lemaire (c. 1650) shows a similar pyramid obviously inspired by the one in the Chigi Chapel before it was restored by Bernini.Anthony Blunt: Poussin Studies IX - Additions to the Work of Jean Lemaire, Burlington Magazine, Vol. 101, No. 681 (Dec., 1959), pp. 438-445 A modello drawing for a tapestry by Francesco Salviati (c. 1548) shows the same monument crowned with a cap and small bronze ball which were later removed (or never existed). The pyramids are resting on four small supports of africano marble imitating the original astragals of the Vatican obelisk. It is unsure whether the present pedestals are the originals or they were replaced by Bernini. The 1552 contract speaks about seven \\"termini\\" executed by Lorenzetto that could refer to pedestals although the term is ambiguous. Mourning Genius by Lorenzetto (lost).Bernini replaced the reliefs on the base with green verde antico marble panels framed by the original giallo antico mouldings. Only one relief survived, the above-mentioned Christ and the Samaritan Woman (now on the altar-front), which illustrated Christ's words on the water of eternal life. Fabio Chigi in his above-mentioned letter in 1626 mentioned another bronze relief on the short side of the base facing the entrance of the chapel. This was identified by Enzo Bentivoglio who discovered a photograph showing a panel with a Mourning Genius in the Chigi family collection. The artwork itself was apparently lost during the 20th century. The relief depicted a winged putto leaning on a turned-down torch with a sad expression. Obviously a similar relief was planned for the other short side facing the altar but this was never executed by Lorenzetto.Enzo Bentivoglio: La Cappella Chigi. L'immagine ritrovata, in Raffaello a Roma. Atti del Convegno organizzato dalla Bibliotheca Hertziana e dai Musei Vaticano, 1986, pp. 309-14 The new medallions were made of white marble by an assistant sculptor from Bernini's workshop, and instead of the planned copper plates the funerary inscriptions are composed of freestanding bronze letters. The outline of the two planned cartouches can be seen on both tombs, patched up by Bernini - this is a proof that the marble slabs covering the other pyramid were also cut in the 16th century. The epitaphs were composed with the help of Lucas Holstenius, an erudite humanist and senior custodian of the Vatican Library. The Chi Rho symbol was added to the top of the pyramids. The tombs were covered with portasanta marble slabs whose red and grey colours suggested the combustion and smoke of ancient Roman imperial funerals, while the pyramidal form evoked the multistory imperial rogus or funeral pyre.Fabio Barry: Painting in Stone: The Symbolism of Colored Marbles in the Visual Arts and Literature from Antiquity until the Enlightenment, Columbia University, 2011, pp. 490-491 These funerals were customarily held on the Campus Martius where the basilica was located, and an eagle was released from the pyre signifying the ascent of the soul to heaven. It is not coincidental that the frieze panels to the left and right of the altar are decorated with soaring eagles. Seen as a whole, this is another example where the erudite Classical symbolism of the chapel was integrated into a broader Christian resurrection imagery.Ingrid D. Rowland: Render Unto Caesar the Things Which are Caesar's: Humanism and the Arts in the Patronage of Agostino Chigi, Renaissance Quarterly Vol. 39, No. 4 (Winter, 1986), p. 706 The wall behind the tombs is covered with an unusual marble panelling of portasanta rectangles and africano borders. This revetment is already visible on Salviati's drawing, proving that it was part of the original scheme of the chapel, but on the modello drawing the lunette is also covered with the same encrustation. Regardless of whether this was ever really completed, the simple white marble cornices above the tombs should be 17th- century additions. The frieze between the cornices is made of smooth, dark red rosso antico marble, while the older frieze in the rest of the chapel had been made of portasanta. The antique source of this peculiar raised block revetment, if there was any, remains unknown although some lost part of the interior revetment of the Pantheon is sometimes proposed. Lunettes The sacerdotal ancestors of the Virgin by Raffaello VanniThe lunettes are filled with oil on wood panels of Raffaello Vanni, commissioned by Fabio Chigi in 1653. The theme of these often overlooked paintings is somewhat enigmatic, giving rise to different interpretations. In the guides they are often described as \\"David and Saul\\" and \\"Eli and Samuel\\" or simply - and wrongly - as \\"prophets\\". The clue to their real meaning was given by a well-informed contemporary description which remained unpublished: Benedetto Mellini's Saggio della Roma Descritta which was written around 1656. Mellini states that the panel above Sigismondo's tomb represents The royal ancestors of the Virgin, while the other panel above Agostino's tomb shows The sacerdotal ancestors of the Virgin.Christina Strunck: Bellori und Bernini rezipieren Raffael. Unbekannte Dokumente zur Cappella Chigi in Santa Maria del Popolo, Marburger Jahrbuch f√ºr Kunstwissenschaft 30. Bd. (2003), p. 149 The royal ancestors are King David with the harp and Goliath's head, and a younger king, undoubtedly Solomon, the Temple Builder, kneeling and looking up at heaven. A boy holding a sword places his foot on the severed head triumphantly on the right, on the other side a child kneels with a circlet on his head, perhaps Solomon's young heir, Rehoboam. The sacerdotal ancestors are represented through a Jewish High Priest in traditional garb and his helpers offering doves and incense to God. The lunette paintings thematically complement Sebastiano del Piombo's altar-piece creating a link between the nativity of the Virgin and the stories of the Old Testament depicted on the tambour. During a 20th-century restoration the wall under the panels was exposed but no previous decoration was discovered. The semicircular wooden panels are set in a similar gilded bronze frame as the main altar-piece. Pavement The geometric pavement by Bernini The present pavement was designed by Bernini who walled in a preexisting opening in front of the altar and raised the altar by two steps emphasizing its symbolic importance (the third step is a later addition which disrupts the decorative pattern). The elegantly molded original steps were made of monolith blocks of statuario marble. The white and grey bardiglio marble pavement has a geometric pattern corresponding with the decoration of the dome. There is an inlaid opus sectile roundel at the center, surrounded by a frame of stylized roses and oak leaves. Inside the figure of a winged skeleton is lifting the coat-of-arms of the Chigi family symbolizing the triumph of dynastic virtue over death. There is a scroll with a Latin inscription under the figure: Mors aD CaeLos (meaning \\"through death to heaven\\"). The capital letters add up the date of the beginning of the reconstruction in Roman numerals: MDCL = 1650. The roundel was executed by stonecutter Gabriele Renzi in 1653/54. (Contemporary sources prove that the inscription was originally \\"Mors aD CaeLos Iter\\", the letters adding up to 1651, the year when Fabio Chigi returned to Rome on the last day of November after his long absence abroad.)Gasparo Alveri: Roma in ogni stato, V. Mascardi, 1664, p. 10 Furniture The bronze lamp which forms a Marian crownAt present there is almost no furniture in the chapel except an attractive bronze eternal lamp which forms a gilded crown hanging on chains, decorated with the eight-pointed stars of the Chigi and supported by three flying cherubs. The design is a symbolic reference to the crown of the Virgin, the patron of the chapel and the Chigi family. The lamp was designed by Bernini himself. In his diary the Pope confirmed the great sculptor's authorship: \\"Yesterday, we saw the bronze lamp made for the chapel in the Popolo by Bernini\\", he wrote on 16 July 1657.Martina Droth (ed.): Taking Shape: Finding Sculpture in the Decorative Arts, 2009, pp. 24-25 The lamp was modelled by Peter Verpoorten, a Flemish assistant of Bernini, cast by Francuccio Francucci and gilded by Francesco Perone. Filippo Baldinucci says in his Vita that Bernini \\"was accustomed to putting in no less study and application in designing an oil lamp than in designing a very noble edifice\\".Filippo Baldinucci: The Life of Bernini, trans. Catherine Enggass, Penn State Press, 1965, p. 78 A similar lamp was created for the Cybo Chapel in the basilica, a copy was made in 1885 for the Palazzo Chigi in Ariccia,I Papi della Speranza: Arte e religiosit√† nella Roma del '600, Gangemi Editore, p. 103 and also other casts of the lamp are known. Design of the monumental bronze candlesticksThe two monumental 1.5 m high bronze candlesticks with the Chigi symbols are standing guard at the entrance; these were lit during the celebration of the holy mass. The candlesticks are placed on painted wood plinths. A drawing by a follower of Bernini in the Royal Collection, dated between 1655 and 1665, shows a design for a similar object, although the sketch might have been created for the altar candles of Saint Peter's Basilica. The altar is flanked by two white marble wall flower stands decorated with palm fronds. Originally Fabio Chigi provided other pieces of ecclesiastical furniture for the restored family chapel. Six gilded bronze candlesticks were placed upon the table of the altar, their shape and number evoking the six mountains of the Chigi emblem. They were variants of those conceived by the artist for the altar of the St. Peter's. They were supplemented by gilded wooden altar cards and a bronze crucifix-tabernacle, the chest of which was supported by four seraphim and the door decorated with a chalice and a radiant host. A similar set was created for the Church of Santa Maria Assunta in Ariccia by Bernini. These liturgical pieces were still recorded in an inventory in the 1720s. Fabio Chigi granted eight reliquaries to the chapel in 1654 and in 1656, containing the bones of different saints. The two set of small crystal pyramids are preserved in the treasury of the basilica. The pyramidal shape seems to be an homage to pyramidal tombs in the chapel.Maria Grazia D‚ÄôAmelio: Gli eroi della fede.I reliquiari di Alessandro VII per la cappella Chigi nella basilica romana di Santa Maria del Popolo, 2005 Materials The use of rare and expensive stones all over the chapel is an important characteristic invoking the interior of the Pantheon which was the main source of inspiration for Raphael. He was very much aware that the ancients used more precious materials than contemporary Renaissance architects and intended follow their example. In a letter to Pope Leo X (c. 1519) he wrote:The Letter to Leo X by Raphael and Baldassare Castiglione, in: Palladio's Rome, ed. Vaughan Hart and Peter Hicks, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2006, p. 182 > \\"...even though these days architecture may be very clever and very closely > based on the style of the ancients, [...] nevertheless the ornamentation is > not done using raw materials of similar expense to those used by the > ancients, who, it seems, realized what they envisaged with endless amounts > of money and whose will alone surmounted every difficulty.\\" The frieze and the capitals are white \\"bianco purissimo\\" marbleAs a painter Raphael was naturally attracted to the vivid colours of the different kinds of stones available in Rome since the antiquity, and his patron, Agostino Chigi was one of the few people rich enough to finance a project that aimed to recreate the largely lost chromatic exuberance of ancient architecture. At the time of Raphael the coloured revetment of the Chigi Chapel was a complete novelty in Rome, and it remained exceptional until the Cappella Gregoriana in St. Peter's Basilica was decorated in 1578-80, but during the Baroque era the use of coloured marbles became very common. White Carrara marble (with grey veins): fluted pilasters; white \\"bianco purissimo\\" Carrara marble: capitals and friezes; statuario marble: altar steps; white and grey bardiglio marble: pavement; Egyptian \\"rosso di Syene\\" granite: monolith entrance step; africano and rosso antico marble: frames of the niches; rosso di Numidia: shells of the niches; Portasanta marble: pyramids, balusters; verde antico: bases of the pyramids; giallo antico: mouldings of the bases of the pyramids, balustrade; rosso di Numidia and Portasanta rectangles, africano borders: revetment behind the pyramids; arches, entablement and moulding rings of the dome: white Carrara marble; rosso antico: frieze above the tombs.Cecilia Magnusson:The antique sources of the Chigi Chapel, Konsthistorisk Tidskrift, 56:4, p. 135 In popular culture Part of Dan Brown's book Angels & Demons takes place in the Chigi Chapel, where the sculpture of Habakkuk and the Angel is one of the four \\"markers\\" leading to the Illuminati's secret lair.

Conjunto La Perfecta In 1961, bandleader Eddie Palmieri heard Quintana sing in an audition and invited him to join his newly-organized conjunto (small band) La Perfecta. Quintana accepted and became the lead singer of the band between 1961 and 1971. During this time he co-wrote some of Palmieri's major hit songs. With Palmieri, Quintana was awarded the 1966 Trophy for the \\"Most Popular Latin Singer of the Year\\", awarded at the famed Palladium Ballroom in New York.Quintana Quintana left Palmieri for a solo career and signed with Vaya Records (subsidiary of Fania Records) .

The station serves York University but is located in an industrial area away from the York campus and connected by a shuttle bus service privately operated by the university. The station was only served on weekdays, southbound during the morning peak period and northbound during the afternoon peak period, while the nearby Downsview Park station provides a connection from midday, evening, and weekend/holiday GO trains to the university at all times via a 2-stop trip on the TTC Line 1 subway. The station has not been served since March 18th, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The station consists of a single platform on the west track with passenger shelters. History York University GO Station was funded by a provincial investment of C$850,000, and completed in 2002. The station officially opened on September 6, 2002, though it had been put into service earlier. Downsview Park station was originally planned to entirely replace York University GO station, given that it would be connected to York University by the TTC Line 1 subway extension. However, following objection from York University members and the local councillor, the station was not closed following the opening of Downsview Park GO station on December 30, 2017. As a compromise, service was retained at York University in one direction during the weekday peak periods, but off-peak services would no longer stop at York University GO station. Services As of January 2018, weekday service consists of 8 trains southbound to Union Station in the morning, 7 trains northbound to Barrie Allandale Station in the afternoon, and 1 train northbound to Bradford in the evening. There is no service at this station on weekends. As of March 18th, 2020, trains no longer serve this station due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting closure of York University. As of October 2020, the station is no longer listed on schedules or on GO Transit's website, though it has not been officially closed. Connections The only bus route directly serving the station is York University's privately operated shuttle bus, which is only available for York University students and employees. The nearest public transit connection is TTC Route 107 St. Regis, which stops on Petrolia Road.

Pressure is an expression of the force required to stop a fluid from expanding, and is usually stated in terms of force per unit area. A pressure sensor usually acts as a transducer; it generates a signal as a function of the pressure imposed. For the purposes of this article, such a signal is electrical. Pressure sensors are used for control and monitoring in thousands of everyday applications. Pressure sensors can also be used to indirectly measure other variables such as fluid/gas flow, speed, water level, and altitude. Pressure sensors can alternatively be called pressure transducers, pressure transmitters, pressure senders, pressure indicators, piezometers and manometers, among other names. Pressure sensors can vary drastically in technology, design, performance, application suitability and cost. A conservative estimate would be that there may be over 50 technologies and at least 300 companies making pressure sensors worldwide. There is also a category of pressure sensors that are designed to measure in a dynamic mode for capturing very high speed changes in pressure. Example applications for this type of sensor would be in the measuring of combustion pressure in an engine cylinder or in a gas turbine. These sensors are commonly manufactured out of piezoelectric materials such as quartz. Some pressure sensors are pressure switches, which turn on or off at a particular pressure. For example, a water pump can be controlled by a pressure switch so that it starts when water is released from the system, reducing the pressure in a reservoir. Types of pressure measurements silicon piezoresistive pressure sensors Pressure sensors can be classified in terms of pressure ranges they measure, temperature ranges of operation, and most importantly the type of pressure they measure. Pressure sensors are variously named according to their purpose, but the same technology may be used under different names. *Absolute pressure sensor This sensor measures the pressure relative to perfect vacuum. Absolute pressure sensors are used in applications where a constant reference is required, like for example, high-performance industrial applications such as monitoring vacuum pumps, liquid pressure measurement, industrial packaging, industrial process control and aviation inspection. *Gauge pressure sensor This sensor measures the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. A tire pressure gauge is an example of gauge pressure measurement; when it indicates zero, then the pressure it is measuring is the same as the ambient pressure. *Vacuum pressure sensor This term can cause confusion. It may be used to describe a sensor that measures pressures below atmospheric pressure, showing the difference between that low pressure and atmospheric pressure, but it may also be used to describe a sensor that measures absolute pressure relative to a vacuum. *Differential pressure sensor This sensor measures the difference between two pressures, one connected to each side of the sensor. Differential pressure sensors are used to measure many properties, such as pressure drops across oil filters or air filters, fluid levels (by comparing the pressure above and below the liquid) or flow rates (by measuring the change in pressure across a restriction). Technically speaking, most pressure sensors are really differential pressure sensors; for example a gauge pressure sensor is merely a differential pressure sensor in which one side is open to the ambient atmosphere. *Sealed pressure sensor This sensor is similar to a gauge pressure sensor except that it measures pressure relative to some fixed pressure rather than the ambient atmospheric pressure (which varies according to the location and the weather). Pressure-sensing technology Front and back of a silicon pressure sensor chip. Note the etched depression in the front; the sensitive area is extremely thin. The back side shows the circuitry, and rectangular contact pads at top and bottom. Size: 4x4 mm. There are two basic categories of analog pressure sensors, Force collector types These types of electronic pressure sensors generally use a force collector (such a diaphragm, piston, bourdon tube, or bellows) to measure strain (or deflection) due to applied force over an area (pressure). * Piezoresistive strain gauge Uses the piezoresistive effect of bonded or formed strain gauges to detect strain due to applied pressure, resistance increasing as pressure deforms the material. Common technology types are Silicon (Monocrystalline), Polysilicon Thin Film, Bonded Metal Foil, Thick Film, Silicon-on-Sapphire and Sputtered Thin Film. Generally, the strain gauges are connected to form a Wheatstone bridge circuit to maximize the output of the sensor and to reduce sensitivity to errors. This is the most commonly employed sensing technology for general purpose pressure measurement. *Capacitive Uses a diaphragm and pressure cavity to create a variable capacitor to detect strain due to applied pressure, capacitance decreasing as pressure deforms the diaphragm. Common technologies use metal, ceramic, and silicon diaphragms. *Electromagnetic Measures the displacement of a diaphragm by means of changes in inductance (reluctance), LVDT, Hall Effect, or by eddy current principle. *Piezoelectric Uses the piezoelectric effect in certain materials such as quartz to measure the strain upon the sensing mechanism due to pressure. This technology is commonly employed for the measurement of highly dynamic pressures. As the basic principle is dynamic no static pressures can be measured with piezoelectric sensors. *Strain-Gauge Strain gauge based pressure sensors also use a pressure sensitive element where metal strain gauges are glued on or thin film gauges are applied on by sputtering. This measuring element can either be a diaphragm or for metal foil gauges measuring bodies in can-type can also be used. The big advantages of this monolithic can-type design are an improved rigidity and the capability to measure highest pressures of up to 15,000 bar. The electrical connection is normally done via a Wheatstone bridge which allows for a good amplification of the signal and precise and constant measuring results. *Optical Techniques include the use of the physical change of an optical fiber to detect strain due to applied pressure. A common example of this type utilizes Fiber Bragg Gratings. This technology is employed in challenging applications where the measurement may be highly remote, under high temperature, or may benefit from technologies inherently immune to electromagnetic interference. Another analogous technique utilizes an elastic film constructed in layers that can change reflected wavelengths according to the applied pressure (strain).Elastic hologram' pages 113-117, Proc. of the IGC 2010, here: http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/225960 *Potentiometric Uses the motion of a wiper along a resistive mechanism to detect the strain caused by applied pressure. * Force balancing A force-balanced fused quartz bourdon tube pressure sensor, the mirror that should be mounted to the armature is absent. Force-balanced fused quartz bourdon tubes use a spiral bourdon tube to exert force on a pivoting armature containing a mirror, the reflection of a beam of light from the mirror senses the angular displacement and current is applied to electromagnets on the armature to balance the force from the tube and bring the angular displacement to zero, the current that is applied to the coils is used as the measurement. Due to the extremely stable and repeatable mechanical and thermal properties of fused quartz and the force balancing which eliminates most non-linear effects these sensors can be accurate to around 1PPM of full scale.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230966593_Characterization_of_quartz_Bourdon- type_high-pressure_transducers Due to the extremely fine fused quartz structures which are made by hand and require expert skill to construct these sensors are generally limited to scientific and calibration purposes. Non force-balancing sensors have lower accuracy and reading the angular displacement cannot be done with the same precision as a force-balancing measurement, although easier to construct due to the larger size these are no longer used. Other types These types of electronic pressure sensors use other properties (such as density) to infer pressure of a gas, or liquid. *Resonant Uses the changes in resonant frequency in a sensing mechanism to measure stress, or changes in gas density, caused by applied pressure. This technology may be used in conjunction with a force collector, such as those in the category above. Alternatively, resonant technology may be employed by exposing the resonating element itself to the media, whereby the resonant frequency is dependent upon the density of the media. Sensors have been made out of vibrating wire, vibrating cylinders, quartz, and silicon MEMS. Generally, this technology is considered to provide very stable readings over time. A pressure sensor, a resonant quartz crystal strain gauge with a bourdon tube force collector is the critical sensor of DART. DART detects tsunami waves from the bottom of the open ocean. It has a pressure resolution of approximately 1mm of water when measuring pressure at a depth of several kilometers. *Thermal Uses the changes in thermal conductivity of a gas due to density changes to measure pressure. A common example of this type is the Pirani gauge. *Ionization Measures the flow of charged gas particles (ions) which varies due to density changes to measure pressure. Common examples are the Hot and Cold Cathode gauges. Applications Industrial wireless pressure sensor There are many applications for pressure sensors: *Pressure sensing This is where the measurement of interest is pressure, expressed as a force per unit area. This is useful in weather instrumentation, aircraft, automobiles, and any other machinery that has pressure functionality implemented. *Altitude sensing This is useful in aircraft, rockets, satellites, weather balloons, and many other applications. All these applications make use of the relationship between changes in pressure relative to the altitude. This relationship is governed by the following equation:http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/slc/projects/wxcalc/formulas/pressureAltitude.pdf National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association ::: h = (1-(P/P_\\\\mathrm{ref})^{0.190284}) \\\\times 145366.45\\\\mathrm{ ft} This equation is calibrated for an altimeter, up to 36,090 feet (11,000 m). Outside that range, an error will be introduced which can be calculated differently for each different pressure sensor. These error calculations will factor in the error introduced by the change in temperature as we go up. Barometric pressure sensors can have an altitude resolution of less than 1 meter, which is significantly better than GPS systems (about 20 meters altitude resolution). In navigation applications altimeters are used to distinguish between stacked road levels for car navigation and floor levels in buildings for pedestrian navigation. *Flow sensing This is the use of pressure sensors in conjunction with the venturi effect to measure flow. Differential pressure is measured between two segments of a venturi tube that have a different aperture. The pressure difference between the two segments is directly proportional to the flow rate through the venturi tube. A low pressure sensor is almost always required as the pressure difference is relatively small. *Level / depth sensing A pressure sensor may also be used to calculate the level of a fluid. This technique is commonly employed to measure the depth of a submerged body (such as a diver or submarine), or level of contents in a tank (such as in a water tower). For most practical purposes, fluid level is directly proportional to pressure. In the case of fresh water where the contents are under atmospheric pressure, 1psi = 27.7 inH20 / 1Pa = 9.81 mmH20. The basic equation for such a measurement is :: P=\\\\rho gh where P = pressure, œÅ = density of the fluid, g = standard gravity, h = height of fluid column above pressure sensor *Leak testing A pressure sensor may be used to sense the decay of pressure due to a system leak. This is commonly done by either comparison to a known leak using differential pressure, or by means of utilizing the pressure sensor to measure pressure change over time. Ratiometric correction of transducer output Piezoresistive transducers configured as Wheatstone bridges often exhibit ratiometric behavior with respect not only to the measured pressure, but also the transducer supply voltage. ::: V_\\\\mathrm{out} ={ P \\\\times K \\\\times Vs_\\\\mathrm{actual} \\\\over Vs_\\\\mathrm{ideal} } where: V_\\\\mathrm{out} is the output voltage of the transducer. P is the actual measured pressure. K is the nominal transducer scale factor (given an ideal transducer supply voltage) in units of voltage per pressure. Vs_\\\\mathrm{actual} is the actual transducer supply voltage. Vs_\\\\mathrm{ideal} is the ideal transducer supply voltage. Correcting measurements from transducers exhibiting this behavior requires measuring the actual transducer supply voltage as well as the output voltage and applying the inverse transform of this behavior to the output signal: ::: P = {V_\\\\mathrm{out} \\\\times Vs_\\\\mathrm{ideal} \\\\over K \\\\times Vs_\\\\mathrm{actual} } Note: Common mode signals often present in transducers configured as Wheatstone bridges are not considered in this analysis.

This is the most simple example of Velocimetry. Velocimetry is the measurement of the velocity of fluids. This is a task often taken for granted, and involves far more complex processes than one might expect. It is often used to solve fluid dynamics problems, study fluid networks, in industrial and process control applications, as well as in the creation of new kinds of fluid flow sensors. Methods of velocimetry include particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry, Molecular tagging velocimetry, laser-based interferometry, ultrasonic Doppler methods, Doppler sensors, and new signal processing methodologies. In general, velocity measurements are made in the Lagrangian or Eulerian frames of reference (see Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates). Lagrangian methods assign a velocity to a volume of fluid at a given time, whereas Eulerian methods assign a velocity to a volume of the measurement domain at a given time. A classic example of the distinction is particle tracking velocimetry, where the idea is to find the velocity of individual flow tracer particles (Lagrangian) and particle image velocimetry, where the objective is to find the average velocity within a sub-region of the field of view (Eulerian).  History  Velocimetry can be traced back to the days of Leonardo da Vinci, who would float grass seeds on a flow and sketch the resulting trajectories of the seeds that he observed (a Lagrangian measurement). Eventually da Vinci's flow visualizations were used in his cardio vascular studies, attempting to learn more about blood flow throughout the human body. Smoke used as a visualizer similarly to the technique Marley popularized. Methods similar to da Vinci's were carried out for close to four hundred years due to technological limitations. One other notable study comes from Felix Savart in 1833. Using a stroboscopic instrument, he sketched water jet impacts. In the late 19th century a huge breakthrough was made in these technologies when it because possible to take photographs of flow patterns. One notable instance of this is Ludwig Mach using particles unresolvable by the naked eye to visualize streamlines. Another notable contribution occurred in the 20th century by Jules Marey who used photographic techniques to introduce the concept of the smoke box. This model allowed both for the directions of the flow to be tracked but also the speed, as streamlines closer together indicated faster flow. More recently, high speed cameras and digital technology has revolutionized the field. allowing for the possibility of many more techniques and rendering of flow fields in three dimensions. Methods Today the basic ideas established by da Vinci are the same; the flow must be seeded with particles that can be observed by the method of choice. The seeding particles depend on many factors including the fluid, the sensing method, the size of the measurement domain, and sometimes the expected accelerations in the flow. If the flow contains particles that can be measured naturally, seeding the flow is unnecessary. Spatial reconstruction of fluid streamtubes using long exposure imaging of tracer can be applied for streamlines imaging velocimetry, high resolution frame rate free velocimetry of stationary flows. Temporal integration of velocimetric information can be used to totalize fluid flow. For measuring velocity and length on moving surfaces, laser surface velocimeters are used. Vector field created by a PIV analysis of vortexes The fluid generally limits the particle selection according to its specific gravity; the particles should ideally be of the same density as the fluid. This is especially important in flows with a high acceleration (for example, high-speed flow through a 90-degree pipe elbow). Heavier fluids like water and oil are thus very attractive to velocimetry, whereas air ads a challenge in most techniques that it is rarely possible to find particles of the same density as air. Still, even large-field measurement techniques like PIV have been performed successfully in air. Particles used for seeding can be both liquid droplets or solid particles. Solid particles being preferred when high particle concentrations are necessary. For point measurements like laser Doppler velocimetry, particles in the nanometre diameter range, such as those in cigarette smoke, are sufficient to perform a measurement. In water and oil there are a variety of inexpensive industrial beads that can be used, such as silver-coated hollow glass spheres manufactured to be conductive powders (tens of micrometres diameter range) or other beads used as reflectors and texturing agents in paints and coatings. The particles need not be spherical; in many cases titanium dioxide particles can be used.  Relevant Applications  PIV has been used in research about controlling aircraft noise. This noise is created by the high speed mixing of hot jet exhaust with the ambient temperature of the environment. PIV has been used to model this behavior. Additionally, Doppler velocimetry enables noninvasive techniques of determining whether fetuses are the proper size at a given term of pregnancy.

Egg is not shown. Third, fourth, and fifth images depict different ages of pupae. Holometabolism, also called complete metamorphosis, is a form of insect development which includes four life stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago or adult. Holometabolism is a synapomorphic trait of all insects in the superorder Endopterygota. Immature stages of holometabolous insects are very different from the mature stage. In some species the holometabolous life cycle prevents larvae from competing with adults because they inhabit different ecological niches. The morphology and behavior of each stage are adapted for different activities. For example, larval traits maximize feeding, growth, and development, while adult traits enable dispersal, mating, and egg laying. Some species of holometabolous insects protect and feed their offspring. Other insect developmental strategies include ametabolism and hemimetabolism. Developmental stages There are four general developmental stages, each with its own morphology and function. Various insect eggs. =Egg= The first stage of the insect life cycle is the egg, or embryo, for all developmental strategies. The egg begins as a single cell which divides and develops into the larval form before hatching. Some insects reproduce by parthenogenesis or may be haplodiploid, and produce viable eggs without fertilization. The egg stage in most insects is very short, only a few days. However, insects may hibernate, or undergo diapause in the egg stage to avoid extreme conditions, in which case this stage can last several months. The eggs of some types of insects, such as tsetse flies, or aphids (which are hemimetabolous), hatch before they are laid. rhinoceros beetle. =Larva= The second stage of the holometabolous life cycle is the larva (plural: larvae). Many adult insects lay their eggs directly onto a food source so the larvae may begin eating as soon as they hatch. Larvae never possess wings or wing buds, and have simple rather than compound eyes. In most species, the larval stage is mobile and worm-like in form. Larvae can be classified by their body type: *Elateriform: wireworm- like, as in the beetle family Elateridae. *Eruciform: caterpillar-like, as in the Lepidoptera and Symphyta. Some that lack legs, such as the larvae of Nematoceran flies such as mosquitoes, are called apodous eruciform. *Scarabaeiform: grub-like, with a head-capsule, as in the beetle family Scarabaeidae. *Vermiform: maggot-like, as in most species of Brachyceran flies. *Campodeiform: similar to members of the genus Campodea, elongated, more or less straight, flattened, and active, with functional legs. The larval stage is variously adapted to gaining and accumulating the materials and energy necessary for growth and metamorphosis. Most holometabolous insects pass through several larval stages, or instars, as they grow and develop. The larva must moult to pass from each larval stage. These stages may look very similar and differ mostly in size, or may differ in many characteristics including, behavior, color, hairs, and spines, and even number of legs. Differences between larval stages are especially pronounced in insects with hypermetamorphosis. The final larval stage in some insects is called a prepupa. Prepupae do not feed, and become inactive. Rhopalomyia solidaginis, pupa and emerging adult. =Pupa= To enter the third stage of homometabolous development, the larva undergoes metamorphosis into a pupa. The pupa is a quiescent, non-feeding developmental stage. Most pupae move very little, however, the pupae of some species, such as mosquitoes, are mobile. In preparation for pupation, the larvae of many species seek protected sites or construct a protective cocoon of silk or other material, such as its own accumulated feces. Some insects undergo diapause as pupa. In this stage, the insect's physiology and functional structure, both internal and external, change drastically. Pupae can be classified into three types: obtect, exarate, and coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed, such as a butterfly chrysalis. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. =Imago= The final stage of holometabolous insect development is the adult, or imago. Most adult insects have wings (excepting where secondarily lost) and functioning reproductive organs. Most adult insects grow very little after eclosion from the pupa. Some adult insects do not feed at all, and focus entirely on mating and reproduction. Some adult insects are postmitotic at adult emergence, with dividing cells restricted to specific organs. Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni is one such species, that does feed in the adult stage but does not grow in size. Nutrition is utilized in adults for growth of the internal reproductive structures. Evolutionary context of holometabolan development Around 45% to 60% of all known living species are holometabolan insects. Juveniles and adult forms of holometabolan insects often occupy different ecological niches, exploiting different resources. This fact is considered a key driver in the unusual evolutionary diversification of form and physiology within this group. According to the latest phylogenetic reconstructions, holometabolan insects are monophyletic, which suggests that the evolutionary innovation of complete metamorphosis occurred only once. Paleontological evidence shows that the first winged insects appeared in the Paleozoic. Carboniferous fossil samples (approximately 350 Ma) already display a remarkable diversity of species with functional wings. These fossil remains show that the primitive Apterygota and the ancient winged insects were ametabolous (completely lacking metamorphosis). By the end of the Carboniferous, and into the Permian (approximately 300 Ma), most pterygotes had post-embryonic development which included separated nymphal and adult stages, which shows that hemimetaboly had already evolved. The earliest known fossil insects that can be considered holometabolan appear in the Permian strata (approximately 280 Ma). Phylogenetic studies also show that the sister group of Endopterygota is paraneoptera, which includes hemimetabolan species and a number of neometabolan groups. The most parsimonious evolutionary hypothesis is that holometabolans originated from hemimetabolan ancestors. Theories on the origin of holometabolan metamorphosis The origin of complete metamorphosis in insects has been the subject of a long lasting, and at times fierce, debate. One of the first theories proposed was one by William Harvey in 1651. Harvey suggested that the nutrients contained within the insect egg are so scarce that there was selection for the embryo to be forced to hatch before the completion of development. During the post-hatch larval life, the \\"desembryonized\\" animal would accumulate resources from the external environment and reach the pupal stage, which Harvey viewed as the perfect egg form. However, Jan Swammerdam conducted a dissection study and showed that pupal forms are not egg-like, but instead more of a transitional stage between larvae and adult. In 1883, John Lubbock revitalized Harvey's hypothesis and argued that the origin and evolution of holometabolan development can be explained by the precocious eclosion of the embryo. Hemimetabolan species, whose larvae look like the adult, have an embryo that completes all developmental stages (namely: \\"protopod\\", \\"polipod\\", and \\"oligopod\\" stages) inside the eggshell. Holometabolan species instead have vermiform larvae and a pupal stage after incomplete development and hatching. The debate continued through the twentieth century, with some authors (like Charles P√©rez in 1902) claiming the precocious eclosion theory outlandish, Antonio Berlese reestablishing it as the leading theory in 1913, and Augustus Daniel Imms disseminating it widely among Anglo-Saxon readers from 1925 (see Wigglesworth 1954 for review). One of the most contentious aspects of the precocious eclosion theory that fueled further debate in the field of evolution and development was the proposal that the hemimetabolan nymphal stages are equivalent to the holometabolan pupal stage. Critics of this theory (most notably H. E. Hinton) argue that post-embryonic development in hemimetabolans and holometabolans are equivalent, and rather the last nymphal instar stage of hemimetabolans would be homologous to the holometabolan pupae. More modern opinions still oscillate between these two conceptions of the hemi- to holometabolan evolutionary trend. J.W. Truman and L.M. Riddiford, in 1999, revitalized the precocious eclosion theory with a focus on endocrine control of metamorphosis. They postulated that hemimetabolan species hatch after three embryonic \\"moults\\" into a nymphal form similar to the adult, whereas holometabolan species hatch after only two embryonic 'moults' into vermiform larvae that are very different from the adult. In 2005, however, B. Konopov√° and J. Zrzav√Ω reported ultrastructural studies across a wide range of hemimetabolan and holometabolan species and showed that the embryo of all species in both groups produce three cuticular depositions. The only exception was the Diptera Cyclorrhapha (unranked taxon of \\"high\\" Dipterans, within the infraorder Muscomorpha, which includes the highly studied Drosophila melanogaster) which has two embryonic cuticles, most likely due to secondary loss of the third. Critics of the precocious eclosion theory also argue that the larval forms of holometabolans are very often more specialized than those of hemimetabolans. X. Belles illustrates that the maggot of a fruitfly \\"cannot be envisaged as a vermiform and apodous (legless) creature that hatched in an early embryonic stage.\\" It is in fact extremely specialized: for example, the cardiostipes and dististipes of the mouth are fused, as in some mosquitoes, and these parts are also fused to the mandibles and thus form the typical mouth hooks of fly larvae. Maggots are also secondarily, and not primitively, apodous. They are more derived and specialized than the cockroach nymph, a comparable and characteristic hemimetabolan example. More recently, an increased focus on the hormonal control of insect metamorphosis has helped resolve some of the evolutionary links between hemi- and holometabolan groups. In particular, the orchestration of the juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids in molting and metamorphosis processes has received much attention. The molecular pathway for metamorphosis is now well described: periodic pulses of ecdysteroids induce molting to another immature instar (nymphal in hemimetabolan and larval in holometabolan species) in the presence of JH, but the programmed cessation of JH synthesis in instars of a threshold size leads to ecdysteroid secretion inducing metamorphosis. Experimental studies show that, with the exception of higher Diptera, treatment of the final instar stage with JH causes an additional immature molt and repetition of that stage. The increased understanding of the hormonal pathway involved in metamorphosis enabled direct comparison between hemimetabolan and holometabolan development. Most notably, the transcription factor Kr√ºppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) which is another important antimetamorphic transducer of the JH pathway (initially demonstrated in D. melanogaster and in the beetle Tribolium castaneum) has been used to compare hemimetabolan and holometabolan metamorphosis. Namely, the Kr√ºppel homolog 1 discovered in the cockroach Blattella germanica (a representative hemimatabolan species), \\"BgKr-h1\\", was shown to be extremely similar to orthologues in other insects from holometabolan orders. Compared to many other sequences, the level of conservation is high, even between B. germanica and D. melanogaster, a highly derived holometabolan species. The conservation is especially high in the C2H2 Zn finger domain of the homologous transducer, which is the most complex binding site. This high degree of conservation of the C2H2 Zn finger domain in all studied species suggests that the Kr-h1 transducer function, an important part of the metamorphic process, might have been generally conserved across the entire class Insecta. In 2009, a retired British planktologist, Donald I. Williamson, published a controversial paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (via Academy member Lynn Margulis through a unique submission route in PNAS that allowed members to peer review manuscripts submitted by colleagues), wherein Williamson claimed that the caterpillar larval form originated from velvet worms through hybridogenesis with other organisms, giving rising to holometabolan species. This paper was met with severe criticism, and spurred a heated debate in the literature.

The analyst might conclude to buy, sell, hold, hedge or stay out of the particular security. Fixed income products are generally bonds issued by various government treasuries, companies or international organizations. Bond holders are usually entitled to coupon payments at periodic intervals until maturity. These coupon payments are generally fixed amounts (quoted as percentage of the bond's face value) or the coupons could float in relation to LIBOR or another reference rate. Valuation The cash flow of a fixed income product generally consists of several coupon payments over the period of the bond's life, and repayment of the principal at the time of maturity. Since these cash flows occur at several times in the future, the \\"Time Value of Money\\" approach is used to find the \\"Present Value\\" of each cash flow. The sum of all the present values of the bonds cash inflows of the bond is its theoretical value. Following are the typical questions an analyst finds answers for: * Does the real interest rate built into the yield make sense? * Is the real interest rate in line with the expected GDP growth rate (in case of treasury bonds) or earnings growth rate (in case of corporate bonds)? * What is the expectation of GDP growth ? Where do we stand in the economy cycle? * Where do we stand in the business cycle of the particular company, or economic cycle of the particular country? * Is there any change expected in the basic real interest rate in the near future? * Do the prevailing monetary and economic conditions force any monetary easing or tightening so that the base real rate will get changed? * Is the inflation condition worsening or improving? * Are the financial authorities in the country pro-acting or re-acting to the forces of inflation and economic conditions? * Is the risk premium built into the yield enough to compensate for the risks? * What are the likely risks the market has currently priced into the premium and what are the new or hidden risks the market has overlooked and to what extent? * What is the nature and volume of demand for a particular bond? The demand for fixed income products comes from banks, insurance companies, pension fund companies, endowment organisations, External Government Treasuries, individual investors like retirees who need regular fixed cash in-flow. The Fixed Income Analyst covers the term structure or yield curve analysis too. This is in simple terms, analysing all bonds issued by the same entity for different maturities (like US Govt 2yr bond, 10yr bond, 20 year bond). Such analysis enables one to understand the pricing differences between maturities comparable inter-market bonds (like Eur 2yr, 5yr and 10yr bunds) The approaches for analysing fixed income products are broadly as follows: Fundamental approach; Technical Approach; relative value Approach.

Following the outbreak of the American Civil War, Taylor joined the Confederate States Army, serving first as a brigade commander in Virginia, and later as an army commander in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. Taylor commanded the District of West Louisiana and was responsible for successfully opposing United States troops invading upper northwest Louisiana during the Red River Campaign of 1864. He was the only son of Zachary Taylor, the 12th president of the United States. Early years Richard Taylor was born at Springfield, the family's plantation near Louisville, Kentucky, to Zachary Taylor, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army at the time, and Margaret Mackall Smith Taylor. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Richard Lee Taylor, a Virginian who had served in the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783). Richard Taylor, nicknamed Dick, had five older sisters, two of whom died in childhood before Richard was born. Three lived to adulthood: Ann Mackall Taylor, Sarah Knox Taylor, and Mary Elizabeth Taylor. Much of his early life was spent on the American frontier, as his father was a career military officer and commanded frontier forts, and the family followed him. As a youth, Richard was sent to private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts. After starting college studies at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Boston, Taylor completed them at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, where he graduated in 1845. He was a member of Skull and Bones, Yale's social club. \\"This list is compiled from material from the Order of Skull and Bones membership books at Sterling Library, Yale University and other public records. The latest books available are the 1971 Living members and the 1973 Deceased Members books. The last year the members were published in the Yale Banner is 1969.\\" He received no scholastic honors, as he spent the majority of his time reading books on classical and military history. In the beginning of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), Taylor visited his father at the Mexican town of Matamoros in July 1846; there are reports that for some time he served as his voluntary aide-de-camp.Hughes, Nathaniel C. Yale's Confederates: A Biographical Dictionary. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2008, p. 205-206. Having to leave the war because of rheumatoid arthritis, Richard Taylor agreed to manage the family cotton plantation in Jefferson County, Mississippi. In 1850, he persuaded his father (then 12th President after being elected in 1848, inaugurated March 1849) to purchase Fashion, a large sugar cane plantation in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. After his father's sudden death in July 1850, Taylor inherited it. On February 10, 1851, Richard Taylor married Louise Marie Myrthe Bringier (d. 1875), a native of Louisiana and daughter of a wealthy French Creole matriarch Aglae Bringier. Steadily Taylor added acreage to the plantation and improved its sugar works at considerable expense and expanded its labor force to nearly 200 slaves. He became one of the wealthiest men in Louisiana for his holdings. Then the freeze of 1856 ruined his crop, forcing him into heavy debt with a large mortgage on the plantation. His mother-in- law, Aglae Bringier financially aided Taylor and his wife.T. Michael Parrish. Taylor, Richard, American National Biography Online, February 2000. Retrieved January 27, 2016. In 1855, Taylor entered local politics; he was elected to the Louisiana State Senate, in which he served until 1861. First affiliated with the Whig Party, he shifted to the American (Know Nothing) Party, and finally joined the Democratic Party. He was sent to the first Democratic Convention of 1860 in Charleston, South Carolina, as a state delegate and witnessed the splintering of the Democrats. While in Charleston, he tried to work out a compromise between the two Democratic factions, but his attempts failed. American Civil War When the American Civil War erupted, Taylor was asked by Confederate General Braxton Bragg to assist him, as a civilian aide- de-camp without pay, at Pensacola, Florida. Bragg had known Taylor from before the war, and thought his knowledge of military history could help him to organize and train the Confederate forces. Taylor had been opposed to secession, but accepted the appointment. Manassas Junction, looking towards Bull Run and Centreville, Civil War-era drawing by Edwin Forbes While training recruits, Taylor received news that he was commissioned as a colonel of the 9th Louisiana Infantry. The members of the 9th Louisiana voted for Taylor because they thought that with Taylor's connections to Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was widower of his late sister Sarah, the unit would be sent out sooner and see battle more quickly. On July 20, he arrived in Richmond with his regiment and received orders from LeRoy Pope Walker, Confederate States Secretary of War, to board the train and move to Manassas to take part in the First Battle of Manassas; the 9th Louisiana arrived at Manassas Junction only hours after the battle was won by the Confederacy. On October 21, 1861, Taylor was promoted to brigadier general, commanding a Louisiana brigade under Richard S. Ewell in the Shenandoah Valley campaign led by Stonewall Jackson. During the Valley Campaign, Jackson used Taylor's brigade as an elite strike force that set a rapid marching pace and dealt swift flanking attacks. At the Battle of Front Royal on May 23, the First Battle of Winchester on May 25, and finally at the climactic Battle of Port Republic on June 9, Taylor led the 9th Infantry in timely assaults against strong enemy positions. His brigade consisted of various Louisiana regiments, as well as Major Chatham Roberdeau Wheat's \\"Louisiana Tiger\\" battalion. The undisciplined lot was known for its hard fighting on the battlefield, but also for its hard living outside. Taylor instilled discipline into the Tigers and, although Major Wheat did not agree with his methods, Taylor won his respect. Taylor subsequently traveled with the rest of Jackson's command to take part in the Seven Days Battles around Richmond. Attacks of rheumatoid arthritis had left him crippled for days at a time and unable to command in battle. For instance, Taylor was unable to leave his camp and command his brigade around this time. He missed the Battle of Gaines Mill, and Col. Isaac Seymour, commanding the brigade in his absence, was killed in action. Taylor was promoted to the rank of major general on July 28, 1862. He was the youngest major general in the Confederacy. When Taylor was promoted over three more senior commanders, they complained of favoritism. President Davis wrote them a letter which noted Taylor's leadership capabilities and promise, and said that he had been recommended by General Jackson. He was ordered to Opelousas, Louisiana, to conscript and enroll troops in the District of Western Louisiana, part of the Trans-Mississippi Department, west of the river. The historian John D. Winters wrote that Taylor was: After his service as a recruit officer, Taylor was given command of the tiny District of West Louisiana. Governor Thomas Overton Moore had insistently requested a capable and dedicated officer to assemble the state's defenses and to help counter Federal forays into the state. Before Taylor returned to Louisiana, Federal forces in the area had raided throughout much of southern Louisiana. During the spring of 1862, Union forces came upon Taylor's Fashion plantation and plundered it. Taylor found the district almost completely devoid of troops and supplies. However, he did the best with these limited resources by securing two capable subordinates, veteran infantry commander Jean-Jacques \\"Alfred\\" Mouton, and veteran cavalry commander Thomas Green. These two commanders would prove crucial to Taylor's upcoming campaigns in the state. During 1863, Taylor directed an effective series of clashes with Union forces over control of lower Louisiana, most notably at Battle of Fort Bisland and the Battle of Irish Bend. These clashes were fought against Union Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks for control of the Bayou Teche region in southern Louisiana and his ultimate objective of Port Hudson. After Banks had successfully pushed Taylor's Army of Western Louisiana aside, Banks continued on his way to Alexandria, Louisiana, before returning south to besiege Port Hudson. After these battles, Taylor formulated a plan to recapture Bayou Teche, along with the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, and to halt the Siege of Port Hudson. =Operations to recapture New Orleans= Taylor's plan was to move down the Bayou Teche, overcoming the lightly defended outposts and supply depots, and then capturing New Orleans, which would cut off Nathaniel P. Banks's army from their supplies. Although his plan met with approval from Secretary of War James A. Seddon and President Jefferson Davis, Taylor's immediate superior, Edmund Kirby Smith, felt that operations on the Louisiana banks of the Mississippi across from Vicksburg would be the best strategy to halt the Siege of Vicksburg. From Alexandria, Louisiana, Taylor marched his army up to Richmond, Louisiana. There he was joined with Confederate Maj. Gen. John G. Walker's Texas Division, who called themselves \\"Walker's Greyhounds\\". Taylor ordered Walker's division to attack Federal troops at two locations on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi. The ensuing Battle of Milliken's Bend and Battle of Young's Point failed to accomplish the Confederate objectives. After initial success at Milliken's Bend, that engagement ended in failure after Federal gunboats began shelling the Confederate positions. Young's Point ended prematurely as well. In response to Confederates summarily executing black U.S. soldiers, U.S. Army general Ulysses S. Grant, wrote a letter to Taylor, urging the Confederates to treat captured black U.S. soldiers humanely and professionally and not murder them. Grant stated the official position of the U.S. government, that black U.S. soldiers were sworn military men and not insurrectionist slaves, as the Confederates asserted they were. After the battles, Taylor marched his army, minus Walker's division, down to the Bayou Teche region. From there Taylor captured Brashear City (Morgan City, Louisiana), which yielded tremendous amounts of supplies, materiel, and new weapons for his army. He moved within the outskirts of New Orleans, which was being held by a few green recruits under Brig. Gen. William H. Emory. While Taylor was encamped on the outskirts and preparing for his attack against the city, he learned that Port Hudson had fallen. He withdrew his forces all the way up Bayou Teche to avoid the risk of being captured. =Red River Campaign= In 1864, Taylor defeated Union General Nathaniel P. Banks in the Red River Campaign with a smaller force, commanding the Confederate forces in the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill on April 8‚Äì9. He pursued Banks back to the Mississippi River and, for his efforts, received the thanks of the Confederate Congress. At these two battles, the two commanders whom Taylor had come to rely on: Brigadier Generals Alfred Mouton and Thomas Green, were killed while leading their men into combat. On April 8, 1864, Taylor was promoted to lieutenant general, despite having asked to be relieved because of his distrust of his superior in the campaign, General Edmund Kirby Smith. The Congress of the Confederate States issued a joint resolution, which officially thanked Taylor and his soldiers for their military service during the Red River Campaign.Journal of the Congress of the Confederate States of America, 7 vols. Washington, D. C., 1904-1905, Volume IV, p. 49. =Last days of the war= Taylor was given command of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. After General John Bell Hood's disastrous campaign into Tennessee and near destruction of his army at the Battle of Franklin, Taylor was briefly given command of the Army of Tennessee, until most of its remnant was sent to contest Sherman's march further north through the Carolinas from Savannah.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001, p. 523. He surrendered his department at Citronelle, Alabama, the third and last major Confederate force remaining east of the Mississippi, to Union General Edward Canby on May 4, 1865, almost a month after Appomattox Courthouse and was paroled three days later. The rest of his command was paroled on May 12, 1865 in Gainesville, Alabama. Military prowess Taylor did not have any military experience until the Civil War broke out.Terry L. Jones. Gen. Taylor said a 'born soldier': Led Southern resistance in South Louisiana However, most of Taylor's contemporaries, subordinates, and superiors spoke many times of his military prowess as he proved himself capable both in the field and in departmental command. Nathan Bedford Forrest commented about Taylor, \\"He's the biggest man in the lot. If we'd had more like him, we would have licked the Yankees long ago.\\"Dufour, Charles L. Nine Men in Gray. Garden City, N.Y: Doubleday, 2015. Charles Erasmus Fenner, an officer in the Confederate Trans- Mississippi Department and post-war Louisiana Supreme Court justice, asserted that, \\"Dick Taylor was a born soldier. Probably no civilian of his time was more deeply versed in the annals of war, including the achievements and personal characteristics of all the great captains, the details and philosophies of their campaigns, and their strategic theories and practice.\\"Parrish, T. M. Richard Taylor, Soldier Prince of Dixie. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1992. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and Richard S. Ewell frequently commented on their conversations with Taylor about military history, strategy and tactics. In particular, Ewell stated that he came away from his conversations with Taylor more knowledgeable, impressed with the amount of information Taylor possessed. It was Stonewall Jackson who recommended promoting Taylor to major general and putting him in command of Confederate forces in western Louisiana.Arthur W. Bergeron, Jr. General Richard Taylor as a military Commander, Louisiana History, Volume XXIII, No. 1, Winter 1982, pp. 35-47. Taylor was one of only three lieutenant generals in the Confederacy who did not graduate from West Point (the others being Forrest and Wade Hampton III). As for Taylor himself, he modestly attributed his progress as commanding officer during the war to two habits: Postbellum life The war resulted in the destruction of Taylor's home and property including his much prized library. He moved his family to New Orleans at the end of the war and lived there until his wife died in 1875. He was president of The Boston Club 1868‚Äì1873. After that, he relocated with his three daughters to Winchester, Virginia, making travels to Washington, D.C. and New York City. He worked on his memoir, Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War, which is one of the most credited reports of the Civil War. The book was published in April 1879.General Richard Taylor, CSA, Historycentral.com The historian T. Michael Parrish wrote that in his book, \\"Taylor finally gave enhanced dignity to defeat and surrender.\\" He was active in Democratic Party politics, interceded on behalf of former President Jefferson Davis, then still held in Fortress Monroe, with President Andrew Johnson, and was a leading political opponent of Northern Reconstruction policies. He died in New York City in the house of his friend and political ally Samuel L. M. Barlow I of dropsy (edema related to congestive heart failure) on 12 April 1879 and was buried in Metairie Cemetery, New Orleans. Family Richard Taylor was the only son of Margaret Mackall Smith and President Zachary Taylor. His sister Sarah Knox Taylor was the first wife of Jefferson Davis for three months until her death in 1835. Another sister, Mary Elizabeth Bliss who had married William Wallace Smith Bliss in 1848, served as her father's White House hostess. Although Taylor chose to serve the Confederacy, his uncle, Joseph Pannell Taylor, served on the opposite side as a Brigadier-General in the Union Army. Richard and Marie (n√©e Bringier) Taylor had five children, two sons and three daughters: Louise, Elizabeth, Zachary, Richard, and Myrthe. Their two sons died of scarlet fever during the War, from which both parents suffered deeply. Remembrance The Lt.

The office of lieutenant governor was established when Mississippi became a state, abolished for a few decades in the first half of the 19th century, and restored later in the century. The Lieutenant Governor is President of the (state) Senate and presides over that body, only voting to break a tie. Compared to the lieutenant governors in other states, Mississippi's has a great deal of power concerning the state Senate. The Lieutenant Governor has the sole ability to appoint members, vice-chairmen, and chairmen to the various Senate committees, regardless of each party's strength in the chamber. For example, former Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, a Republican, appointed other Republicans to the chairmanships of some committees, even though the Democrats had a four-seat majority. Given that power, it is argued that the office is more powerful than the governorship. In the event of the death, resignation, or removal of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor assumes the higher office. Also, if the Governor is out of state, then the Lieutenant Governor can act in the Governor's place. There is a two-term limit, with each term being four years long. The majority of Mississippi Lieutenant Governors have been Democrats, although the post has been held continuously by Republicans since 2002. Since the end of Reconstruction, there have been only four Republicans: Eddie Briggs, who served from 1992 to 1996; Amy Tuck, who served from 2000 to 2008 (who was originally elected as a Democrat before switching to the Republican Party in December 2002 and being re-elected as a Republican in 2003). There's been three consecutive full-time Republicans since 2008, Phil Bryant, who served from 2008 to 2012; Tate Reeves, who served from 2012 to 2020; and Delbert Hosemann who assumed office on January 14, 2020.

Because his work focused more on mood than plot, he became known as \\"the Yiddish Maeterlinck\\". His work as a playwright and through his own short-lived but influential troupe, laid much of the groundwork for the second golden age of Yiddish theater that began shortly after the end of World War I. The dialogue of his plays is consistently vivid, terse, and naturalistic. Unusually for a Yiddish playwright, most of his works have pastoral settings: he had grown up the son of a miller, and made several attempts at farming. Biography He was born in Grodno Governorate (present-day Podlaskie Voivodeship, Poland) where he was educated initially by local tutors, before he eventually made his way to Grodno and then Vilna, where he joined a circle of yeshiva students who studied the Bible, Hebrew grammar, and Jewish history together. Hirshbein began giving Hebrew lessons to support himself while publishing Hebrew poetry and writing Yiddish stories. He also began to shift from writing lyrical poetry to naturalist drama, starting with Miryam (1905), which he first wrote in Hebrew, later translated into Yiddish, and later still revised in Yiddish under the title Barg arop (Downhill). During the early 1900s, Hirshbein continued writing naturalist dramas in Hebrew, including Nevelah (Carcass), which in Yiddish (Di neveyle) became one of Hirshbein's most successful works. Olamot bodedim (Lonely Worlds; 1906) marked a new symbolist phase in his career, as well as the end of his practice of writing originally in Hebrew. His symbolist Yiddish plays of this period include the one-act Kvorim-blumen (Grave Blossoms), Di erd (The Earth), In der finster (In the Dark), and Der tkies-kaf (The Handshake). He was instrumental in the revival of Yiddish theater in Russia shortly after the 1904 lifting of the 1883 ban on theatrical performances in that language. Prior to his involvement in Yiddish theater, he wrote several plays in Hebrew; these were published in the periodical Hazman, but there was no audience at that time for Hebrew-language theater. In 1908 Hirshbein moved to Odessa, where he wrote the drama Yoyel (Joel). Soon afterward, Af yener zayt taykh (On the Other Side of the River), his first Yiddish drama, was produced in Russian in Odessa. In autumn of the same year, Hirshbein, encouraged by Bialik and by students from an acting conservatory in Odessa, founded the theater company that became known as the Hirshbein Troupe. It was the first Yiddish company to devote itself exclusively to \\"better\\" Yiddish theater. The troupe toured through Imperial Russia for two years, staging his own plays, as well as works by Sholem Asch, David Pinski, Sholem Aleichem, and Jacob Gordin, as well as translations of plays by Semen Iushkevich and Herman Heijermans. The troupe's high literary standards and high standards of ensemble acting strongly influenced the later Vilna Troupe and Maurice Schwartz's New York-based Yiddish Art Theater. Peretz Hirschbein (second from left), with Mendl Elkin, Uri Zvi Greenberg, Peretz Markish, Melech Ravitch and I. J. Singer in 1922. The troupe disbanded in 1910 for financial reasons, at which point Hirschbein published what Jacob Glatshteyn (In tokh genumen [Sum and Substance], 1976, p. 77) has called \\"the four greatest plays in the Yiddish repertoire\\": A farvorfn vinkl (A Forsaken Corner; 1912), Di puste kretshme (The Empty [Deserted] Inn; 1913, written in America), Dem shmids tekhter (The Blacksmith's Daughters; 1918) and Grine felder (Green Fields; 1916). In these and other dramas, Hirshbein abandoned symbolism and returned to his rural roots, dramatizing the lives and loves of rural Jews. The understated quality of these works appealed to directors including Maurice Schwartz and Jacob Ben-Ami, and they became regular productions in the repertoire of artistically ambitious Yiddish theaters. His popularity extended to other cultures and genres, and his plays were performed in Russian, Hebrew, English, German, Spanish, and French. Indeed, the 1937 American film Grine felder (Green Fields), based on Hirshbein's play, is among the most beloved of all Yiddish films, and the play continues to be often anthologized and staged. Hirshbein traveled extensively; in 1911 alone, he visited Vienna, Paris, London, and New York City. For a while in 1912, he tried farming in New York's Catskills (later, home to the Borscht Belt); he then returned briefly to Russia, and went from there to Argentina for another attempt at farming, this time in a Jewish agricultural colony. At the start of World War I he was en route to New York on a British ship, which was sunk by a German cruiser. He was briefly taken captive, then let off in Brazil, from where he eventually reached New York. He spent the succeeding decades traveling, accompanied by his wife, Yiddish poet Esther Shumiatcher- Hirschbein, and publishing both fiction and nonfiction based on his trips. Hirschbein's son, Omus Hirschbein, a classical music administrator, was born in New York in 1934 just before the family moved to Los Angeles. Hirschbein suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease) for the last three years of his life. He died August 16, 1948 in Los Angeles.

The Giant's Ring is a henge monument at Ballynahatty, near Shaw's Bridge, Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was originally preserved by Viscount Dungannon. The inscribed stone tablet on the wall surrounding the site which details Viscount Dungannon's interest was carved by Belfast stonecarver Charles A Thompson about c.1919. The site is a State Care Historic Monument and has ASAI (Area of Significant Archaeological Interest) status. The site consists of a circular enclosure, in diameter and in area, surrounded by a circular earthwork bank high. At least three of the five irregularly spaced gaps in the bank are intentional and possibly original. East of the centre of the enclosure is a small passage tomb with a vestigial passage facing west. There were reports of other tombs outside the enclosure, but there is no trace of these. History The Giant's Ring dates from the Neolithic period and was built around 2700BC,Giants Ring meaning that it predates the Egyptian pyramids. The site has had some sort of public use throughout its history. It is near the Shaw's Bridge crossing of the River Lagan, a point which has been used as a crossing of the river since at least the Stone Age. The original purpose of the monument was most likely as a meeting place or as a memorial to the dead. Archaeologist Michael J. O'Kelly believed that the Giant's Ring, like hundreds of other passage tombs built in Ireland during the Neolithic period, such as Newgrange, showed evidence for a religion which venerated the dead as one of its core principles. He believed that this \\"cult of the dead\\" was just one particular form of European Neolithic religion, and that other megalithic monuments displayed evidence for different religious beliefs which were solar, rather than death-orientated.O'Kelly, Michael J. 1982.

He pitched from 2001 to 2007 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, and the Toronto Blue Jays. Early life Kennedy was born in La Mesa, California to John and Holly Kennedy. He had an older brother, John Kennedy Jr., and a younger sister, Bettianne Kennedy. Kennedy played Little League in El Cajon, California. He was a member of the 1991 El Cajon American Little League team that won the Southern California Little League championship. The team was eliminated after a first-round 3-1 loss to Kahulia East Maui in the West Region Tournament in San Bernardino. ‚ÄúWest Region Tournament.‚Äù 1991 Little League¬Æ Baseball West Region Tournament Historical Results, [www.unpage.org/west/wr-1991.htm]. He graduated from El Cajon Valley High School, where he played baseball as well as basketball, volleyball and football. He attended Grossmont College before entering the major league draft. Professional career Kennedy was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the eighth round (252nd overall) of the Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on June 6, with the Devil Rays. =Tampa Bay Devil Rays= Kennedy made his Major League debut on June 6, 2001, becoming the first lefthander to start a game for the Devil Rays in 219 games. He finished 7-8 in 20 starts for the Devil Rays. In his second season, he pitched in 30 starts going 8-11 while throwing 5 complete games for the Devil Rays. In 2003, he was named the Opening Day starter for the Devil Rays after having an abysmal spring training. He made 22 straight starts before being relegated to the bullpen after suffering an arm injury in . He had pitched in 72 consecutive starts for the Devil Rays before being moved to the bullpen. He recorded his first career save on September 10, 2003 against the Blue Jays, pitching three scoreless innings. =Colorado Rockies= Traded to the Colorado Rockies before the season, Kennedy became the first Rockies starter to have a sub 4.00 earned run average, setting a franchise record with a 3.66 ERA while going 9-7 for the Rockies. In 2005, Kennedy struggled as a starter for the Rockies, going 4-8 with a 7.04 ERA. =Oakland Athletics= On June 5, 2005, the A's showed interest in Kennedy. On July 13 of that year, Kennedy, along with pitcher Jay Witasick, was traded by the Rockies to the Oakland Athletics for outfielder Eric Byrnes and minor league infield prospect Omar Quintanilla. Kennedy pitched in the bullpen for Oakland before being pressed into the starter role in September when Rich Harden was injured. Kennedy went 1-5 as a starter for Oakland, and finished the year with a 4-5 record and a 4.70 ERA in the American League. Kennedy pitched well in a middle relief role in Oakland's bullpen in 2006, with a record of 4-1 and a 2.31 ERA. Unfortunately, his role was diminished as he missed three months with shoulder and biceps injuries. Despite struggling in spring training with an ERA above 11.00, Kennedy was named the fifth starter for the Athletics at the start of the season. Through June 2 he compiled a 1-4 record with a 3.3 ERA in 62 innings. He was ineffective afterwards and was placed on waivers. =Arizona Diamondbacks= Kennedy was claimed by the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 4 after being placed on waivers by the Athletics.http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070804&content;_id=2129206&vkey;=pr_oak&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=oak He was designated for assignment on August 15 after allowing 7 runs in 3 games and was released by the Diamondbacks. =Toronto Blue Jays= He signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on August 28 and was called up to the major league team on September 2. He pitched in nine games, all in relief, for the Blue Jays in the final month of the season and went 1-0 with a 5.14 ERA. He became a free agent after the season. Scouting Kennedy had a bevy of pitches at his disposal, featuring a low-90s four-seam fastball, an 88‚Äì90 MPH two-seam fastball, a slow curve, a diving slider and, possibly his second-best pitch after his fastball, a deceptive changeup. His powerful delivery was at the 3/4-sidearm slot, which made his pitches particularly hard for left-handed batters to pick up. He was also very effective against right- handed batters. After struggling a little as a spot-starter for the Athletics, he pitched well in the bullpen in 2006, holding his opponents to a .254 batting average and going 4-1 with a 2.31 ERA. Death On November 23, 2007, Kennedy was in Florida to be the best man at the wedding of a friend. He woke up in the middle of the night and collapsed at the home of his in- laws.Crasnick, Jerry \\"Major league left-hander Joe Kennedy dies\\", ESPN.com, November 23, 2007.

It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, dizziness, feeling tired, and cough. Serious side effects may include liver problems, low blood pressure, angioedema, kidney problems, and high blood potassium. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an ACE inhibitor and works by decreasing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity. Quinapril was patented in 1980 and came into medical use in 1989. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£4 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$3.50. In 2017, it was the 269th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses Quinapril is indicated for the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and as adjunctive therapy in the management of heart failure. It may be used for the treatment of hypertension by itself or in combination with thiazide diuretics, and with diuretics and digoxin for heart failure. Contraindications * Pregnancy * Impaired renal and liver function * Patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor * Hypersensitivity to quinapril Side effects Side effects of quinapril include dizziness, cough, vomiting, upset stomach, angioedema, and fatigue. Mechanism of action Quinapril inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme, an enzyme which catalyses the formation of angiotensin II from its precursor, angiotensin I. Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure through a variety of mechanisms. Due to reduced angiotensin production, plasma concentrations of aldosterone are also reduced, resulting in increased excretion of sodium in the urine and increased concentrations of potassium in the blood.

Nf3 Nc6 :3. Nc3 Nf6 This is the most common sequence, but the knights may in any order to reach the same position. The opening is fairly popular with beginners who strictly adhere to the opening principle: \\"Develop knights before bishops.\\" It was one of the workhorses in the family of the Open Game, at even the highest levels, until World War I. Thereafter it fell by the wayside, along with a number other Open Games. In this period ambitious players explored the Ruy Lopez, believing it a better attempt by White to exploit the advantage of the first move. In the 1990s, this opening saw a renaissance, and is now seen in the praxis of players from beginner to grandmaster. The Four Knights usually leads to quiet , though there are some variations. The ECO codes for the Four Knights Game are C49 (Symmetrical Variation, 4.Bb5 Bb4), C48 (4.Bb5 without 4...Bb4), and C47 (4.d4 and others). Variations4.Bb5= White's most common move is 4.Bb5, the Spanish Variation. This variation can also be reached from the Ruy Lopez, Berlin Defence. After 4.Bb5, Black has three major alternatives. The first of these is 4...Bb4, the Symmetrical Variation known as the Double Spanish Variation. Black can play more aggressively by 4...Nd4, the Rubinstein Variation. White cannot win a pawn with 5.Nxe5, since Black regains the pawn with the advantage of the after 5...Qe7 6.Nf3 (6.f4 Nxb5 7.Nxb5 d6) Nxb5 7.Nxb5 Qxe4+ 8.Qe2 Qxe2+ 9.Kxe2 Nd5 10.c4 a6! White most often plays 5.Ba4, when Black usually continues in gambit fashion with 5...Bc5 6.Nxe5 0-0 7.Nd3 Bb6 8.e5 Ne8 followed by ...d6. Another line, which discourages many ambitious Black players from playing the Rubinstein, is 5.Nxd4 exd4 6.e5 dxc3 7.exf6 Qxf6 (7...cxd2+ 8.Bxd2 Qxf6 9.0-0 is dangerous for Black) 8.dxc3 Qe5+. This often leads to a quick draw after 9.Qe2 Qxe2+. In recent years, Black has tried 4...Bd6!? with varying results.365chess.com That move takes the sting out of 5.Bxc6, which is met with 5...dxc6 with a good game. If White plays , Black will regroup with ...0-0, ...Re8, ...Bf8, and ...d6. =4.d4= If White plays 4.d4, the Scotch Four Knights Game arises. This leads to a more , which can also be reached from the Scotch Game, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3. This variation was played in the fifth game of the 1996 Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match. One reason White may choose the Four Knights (3.Nc3) move order over the Scotch (3.d4), besides fearing that after 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Black may choose 4...Bc5 or 4...Qh4, is that White may want to play the Belgrade Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.Nd5!?). It is not possible to reach the Belgrade from the Scotch. However, the Belgrade is a distant second in popularity to 5.Nxd4. =4.Bc4= A further possibility is 4.Bc4, the Italian Four Knights Game, or Prussian Four Knights Game, popular in the 1880s, though this line is regarded as inferior according to Pinski, and an outright mistake by IM Larry D. Evans.The Fork Trick, published in Chess Life April 2000 and May 2000 Facsimile online (chesscamp.net) Black can preserve the symmetry by 4...Bc5, leading to the quiet Giuoco Pianissimo. A better move order for White that leads to this position is via the Giuoco Piano by 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Nc3 Nf6. The line is a favourite among younger players due to its simple and easy development, but has also been used successfully by Nigel Short against Antoaneta Stefanova.Checkpoint no. 55, Carsten Hansen, ChessCafe.com, 2003, see review of The Four Knights. The problem with playing for this position via the Four Knights Game is that after 4.Bc4, the pseudo-sacrifice of a knight with 4...Nxe4!, the centre fork trick. Then 5.Bxf7+?, though superficially attractive, relinquishes the bishop pair and central control to Black. After 5...Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5 7.Neg5+ Kg8, Black is already threatening 8...e4, and after 8.d3 h6 9.Nh3 Bg4, Black has a very powerful position, with an unopposed light-squared bishop, a strong duo of pawns in the centre, and a safe king, while White needs to work out how to get the displaced knight on h3 into play; often it will need to be played back to g1. Rather than 5.Bxf7+?, a better chance for White to play for is 5.Nxe4, even though 5...d5 regains the piece with a good game, e.g., 6.Bd3 (6.Bxd5? Qxd5 7.Nc3 Qd8 Estrin; 6.Bb5 dxe4 7.Nxe5 Qg5! Collijn's L√§robok; 6.d4 dxc4 7.d5 Ne7 8.Nc3 c6 Cordel‚ÄìSchupli, 1905) 6...dxe4 (the recently discovered 6...Nb4 is also ) 7.Bxe4 Bd6 8.d4 Nxd4 9.Nxd4 exd4 10.Qxd4 0-0 11.Be3 (11.0-0 Bxh2+ wins) Qe7 (Tartakower‚ÄìAtkins, London 1922) and now the natural 12.0-0 Be5 would be awkward for White.Dr. S. Tartakower and J. du Mont, 500 Master Games of Chess, Dover Publications, 1975, p. 53. . In the above line, more ambitious is 8...exd4 9.Nxd4 0-0!?, as in a match game between Siegbert Tarrasch and Emanuel Lasker in 1916, which led to a Black win in 23 moves.This game is analysed by Jan Pinski in The Four Knights, and can be played through here. Another try is 5.0-0!? transposing to a variation of the Boden‚ÄìKieseritzky Gambit. =4.g3= Igor Glek has favoured 4.g3, preparing development of the bishop to g2. According to Pinski, Black's main responses are 4...Bc5 and 4...d5, both of which are reckoned to equalize for Black. A Halloween Gambit style 4...Nxe4 has also been tried at the grandmaster level as in two games between Ilya Smirin and Bart≈Çomiej Macieja. and =4.Be2= Though rarely seen, this move is playable. For example, if Black plays 4...Bb4, White has the responses 5.Nd5, 5.0-0, and 5.d3, which retain equality with accurate play. =4.a3= The quiet 4.a3, the Gunsberg Variation, is a specialty of Polish grandmaster Pawe≈Ç Blehm. =4.Nxe5= A dubious gambit is 4.Nxe5?!, the so-called Halloween Gambit. After 4...Nxe5 5.d4, White tries to seize the centre with his pawns and drive the black knights back to their home squares. Grandmaster Larry Kaufman says that this line is refuted by 5...Nc6 6.d5 Bb4! 7.dxc6 Nxe4 8.Qd4 Qe7, which he attributes to Jan Pinski. According to Max Euwe's opening series volume 11, Black has a decisive advantage after 5...Ng6 6.e5 Ng8 7.Bc4 d5 8.Bxd5 c6.A Breeze in the sleepy Four Knight's Game See also * Italian Game * Ruy Lopez * Scotch game * Three Knights Game * Two Knights Defense References Bibliography  Further reading * External links *Tim Krabb√©'s article on the Halloween Gambit *Unorthodox Openings Newsletter #13, Critical Lines in the Halloween Gambit by Paul Keiser Category:Chess openings ","title":"Four Knights Game"},{"id":"1638738","text":"Four Knights may refer to: *Four Knights Game, a chess opening *The Four Knights, an American doo wop group *Four Nights in Knaresborough, a play by Paul Corcoran (Paul Webb) *The working title for the 1971 song, \\"Early 1970\\" by Ringo Starr *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse *The current 4 autonomous okrugs of Russia: **Chukotka Autonomous Okrug **Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug **Nenets Autonomous Okrug **Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug *The countries of the United Kingdom: **England **Scotland **Wales **Northern Ireland *The provinces of Ireland: **Leinster **Connacht **Munster **Ulster *The Turkic- speaking states of Central Asia: **Kazakhstan **Kyrgyzstan **Turkmenistan **Uzbekistan ","title":"Four Knights"},{"id":"1638740","text":"H√† T√¢y () is a former province of Vietnam, in the Red River Delta, now part of Hanoi. On May 29, 2008 the decision was made to subsume the province into the city of Hanoi. The merger took place on August 1, 2008. The name of the province was a name blending of two former provinces, H√† ƒê√¥ng and S∆°n T√¢y.  Geography  H√† T√¢y province was located in the Red River Delta bordering Hanoi municipality, H∆∞ng Y√™n, H√† Nam, H√≤a B√¨nh, and Ph√∫ Th·ªç provinces. The Kinh account for 99% of the province's population; the remaining population is of the Muong and Dao ethnic groups. The tropical monsoon climate is divided into three geographic microclimates: the plains, with a hot and humid climate dominated by marine winds; the foothills, with a continental climate affected by western winds; and the montane centering on the peaks of Ba V√¨, with a cool climate and an average temperature of 18 ¬∞C. Famous sites include Ch√πa H∆∞∆°ng (Perfume Pagoda), Tay Phuong Pagoda, and hundreds of caves, which were used as homes. Most festivals and activities in H√† T√¢y take place during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months after T·∫øt. The most famous are the pilgrimage to H∆∞∆°ng Pagoda, along with the Th·∫ßy Pagoda and Tay Phuong Pagoda Festivals H√† T√¢y Province lies to the southwest of the entrance to the capital city of Hanoi. For this reason all the tourist attractions of province are around 50 km from the centre of Hanoi and easily accessible by land.  Administrative divisions  Before being merged into Hanoi City on August 1, 2008, H√† T√¢y was subdivided into 14 district-level sub-divisions: * 12 districts: ** Ba V√¨ ** Ch∆∞∆°ng M·ªπ ** ƒêan Ph∆∞·ª£ng ** Ho√†i ƒê·ª©c ** M·ªπ ƒê·ª©c ** Ph√∫ Xuy√™n ** Ph√∫c Th·ªç ** Qu·ªëc Oai ** Th·∫°ch Th·∫•t ** Thanh Oai ** Th∆∞·ªùng T√≠n ** ·ª®ng H√≤a * 2 provincial cities: ** H√† ƒê√¥ng (former capital, and currently an urban district within Hanoi) ** S∆°n T√¢y (currently a district-level town within Hanoi) At the time, those were further subdivided into 22 commune-level towns (or townlets), 405 communes, and 26 wards. Festivals In H√† T√¢y, it is worthy to mention festival tour first because it lasts all the year round. All the festivals bear typical characteristics of traditional festivals of North delta (Red River) which show the religious belief or respect of the inhabitants for different gods and heroes. Each festival can be considered as a living museum containing culture, traditions of the nation to be represented by different ceremonies such as statue-bathing, fish-catching, etc. or by folk games as wrestling, water puppet, Ch√®o Singing, Do Singing, cooking contests, etc. Some festivals in H√† T√¢y Province are well known in Vietnam and the world of which Perfume (H∆∞∆°ng) Pagoda is the most noteworthy because it is the longest and most interesting, attracting about half a million visitors every year. Next attention should be paid to Do Singing Festival in Qu·ªëc Oai district which is only organised once in the every 36 years; Chinese Ch√®o Singing Festival being performed once in every 30 years; Other famous festivals are Th·∫ßy Pagoda festival, Kite-flying festival in Ba Giang- ƒêan Ph∆∞·ª£ng, T√¢y Ph∆∞∆°ng Pagoda festival, D√¢u Pagoda festival, Va temple festival, Hatmon temple festival.  Culture, history and religion  H√† T√¢y Province is a very old land, having long history, which leads to the appearance of 2,388 cultural, historical, and religious relics of which 12 relics are famous and being classified by Ministry of Culture and Information as especially important. These are: * Th·∫ßy Pagoda being closely linked to a famous monk T·ª´ ƒê·∫°o H·∫°nh * B·ªëi Kh√™ Pagoda, Tr·∫°m Gian (100 room) Pagoda being belonging to a hero called Nguy·ªÖn B√¨nh An * T√¢y Ph∆∞∆°ng Pagoda ‚Äì cultural essence of T√¢y S∆°n regime time * Mia Pagoda, which has the most Buddhist statues in Vietnam (287) * D√¢u Pagoda is unique in the sense that it has two real (corpse) statues of two monks; several renowned communal houses such as Tay Dang, Chu Quyen, Dai Phu, Hoa Xa.

None of these are closely related to the evening primroses (genus Oenothera). Etymology The scientific name Primula is a diminutive of the Latin primus, \\"prime\\", alluding to the fact that this flower is among the first to appear in spring.Fran√ßois Couplan, Eva Styner, Guide to Wild Edible and Toxic Plants , Delachaux and Niestl√©, coll. \\"The guides of the naturalist\\" ( ) The vernacular name has the same meaning: primrose derives from a late Latin form prima rosa, consisting of prima, \\"first\\" (feminine), and rosa, \\"rose\\". The Latin specific epithet vulgaris means \\"common\\", in the sense of \\"widespread\\". Description Pin flower of primrose Primula vulgaris is a perennial growing tall, with a basal rosette of leaves which are more-or- less evergreen in favoured habitats. It flowers in early spring in the northern hemisphere (February‚ÄìApril) on slopes and meadows. The leaves are 5‚Äì25 cm long and 2‚Äì6 cm broad, often heavily wrinkled, with an irregularly crenate to dentate margin. The leaf blade is gradually attenuated towards the base and unevenly toothed. The single stem, extremely short, is hidden in the centre of the leaf rosette. The delicately scented flowers are 2‚Äì4 cm in diameter, borne singly on short slender stems.Manfred A. Fischer, Karl Oswald, Wolfgang Adler: Excursion flora for Austria, Liechtenstein and South Tyrol . 3rd, improved edition. Upper Austria, Biology Center of the Upper Austrian Provincial Museums, Linz 2008, , p. 685 . The flowers are typically pale yellow, though white or pink forms are often seen in nature. The flowers are actinomorphic with a superior ovary which later forms a capsule opening by valves to release the small black seeds. The flowers are hermaphrodite but heterostylous; individual plants bear either pin flowers (longuistylous flower: with the capita of the style prominent) or thrum flowers (brevistylous flower: with the stamens prominent). Fertilisation can only take place between pin and thrum flowers. Pin-to-pin and thrum-to-thrum pollination is ineffective.Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Huxley, A, ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Distribution The native range of P. vulgaris encompasses western and southern Europe. In the north, the distribution area extends from central Norway near the Faroe Islands via the British Isles, Denmark, northern Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France to southern Portugal in the south and the tip of North Africa in Algeria. To the east, the range extends through the southern European peninsulas to the Crimea, Balkans, Syria, Turkey and Armenia. Habitat In appropriate conditions, P. vulgaris can cover the ground in open woods and shaded hedgerows. It is found mainly by streams, under bushes, in orchards and clear, moist deciduous forests. Occasionally it also appears in meadows. In Central Europe plants thrive best on nutrient- rich, but lime-poor, humus-rich, loose and often stony loam soils in winter- mild situations. In more populated areas it has sometimes suffered from over- collection and theft so that few natural displays of primroses in abundance can now be found. However it is common on motorway verges and railway embankments where human intervention is restricted. To prevent excessive damage to the species, picking of primroses or the removal of primrose plants from the wild is illegal in many countries, e.g. the UK Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (Section 13, part 1b). Ecology Most (90%) individuals are heterostylous, the minority monostylous. The flowers of the species are visited by a variety of insects, such as butterflies (Lepidoptera), Hymenoptera, beetles (Coleoptera) and Diptera. Which visitors pollinate plants is not fully established. However, good pollinators are said to be bumblebees and hairy flies of the genus Bombylius. However, the most common visitors to the flowers are small beetles of the genus Meligethes ‚Äì often there are up to 12 or more pollen-covered individuals in a single flower. The beetles also fly from flower to flower and, at least theoretically, are well suited as pollinators.Dietmar Aichele, Heinz-Werner Schwegler: The flowering plants of Central Europe , Franckh-Kosmos-Verlag, 2nd revised edition 1994, 2000, Volume 3, The seeds have an elaiosome and are spread by ants (myrmecochory). Subspecies Primula vulgaris subsp. sibthorpii There are three subspecies: *Primula vulgaris subsp. vulgaris. Western and southern Europe. As described above; flowers pale yellow. *Primula vulgaris subsp. balearica (Willk.) W.W.Sm. & Forrest. Balearic Islands (endemic). Flowers white. Leaf stem longer than leaf blade. *Primula vulgaris subsp. sibthorpii (Hoffmanns.) W.W.Sm. & Forrest. Balkans, southwest Asia. Flowers pink to red or purple. The primrose is distinguished from other species of Primula by its pale yellow (in the nominate subspecies) flowers produced singly on long flower stalks which are covered in rather shaggy hairs. The flowers open flat rather than concave as in the case of Primula veris, the cowslip. A pink form is widely seen, growing amongst the much more common yellow forms; this may be a genetic variant rather than a garden escape.Mabey, Richard: Flora britannica (Chatto & Windus, 1996). Clapham, A., Tutin, T., & Warburg, E. (1962). Flora of the Brish Isles. Occasional red forms are more likely to be naturalised from garden varieties. Cultivation The wild primrose is a staple of cottage garden plantings, and is widely available as seeds or young plants. It grows best in moist but well- drained soil in light shade. It is increased by seed and division. The throat is usually coloured rich yellow. Primrose breeding of named coloured varieties became popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Numerous cultivars have been selected for garden planting, often derived from subsp. sibthorpii or hybrids between the subspecies; these and other garden hybrids are available in a wide range of colours, including white, yellow and red, or brown and red in all gradations as well as dark red, pink, purple, dark brown and dark blue, and with an extended flowering season. The term Polyanthus, or Primula polyantha, refers to various tall-stemmed and multi-coloured strains of P. vulgaris √ó P. veris hybrids. Though perennial, they may be short-lived and are typically grown from seed or from young plants as biennials. P. vulgaris and its subspecies sibthorpii have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Use Both flowers and leaves are edible, the flavour ranging between mild lettuce and more bitter salad greens. The leaves can be cooked in soup but preferably with other plants because they are sometimes a little strong. The leaves can also be used for tea, and the young flowers can be made into primrose wine. In the past the whole plant and especially the root were considered to have analgesic, anti-spasmodic, diuretic and expectorant properties. It contains small amounts of saponins, and was given for colds.SRJ Woodell: Natural Hybridization in Britain between Primula vulgaris Huds. (the primrose) and P. elatior (L.) Hill (the oxlip) . In: Watsonia . Volume 7 , No. 3 , 1969, pp. 115-127 Culture The primrose was Benjamin Disraeli's favourite flower; Primrose Day and the Primrose League were given their names in honour of this. It was voted the county flower of Devon in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.Plantlife website County Flowers page Primroses also appear as a charge in heraldry, for example the coat of arms of the Earl of Rosebery.

Population: Ivangorod is a major border crossing point and a railway station by the Tallinn‚ÄìSt. Petersburg line. It is located just opposite to the Estonian town of Narva. The town is the site of the Ivangorod Fortress, a prominent fortification monument of the 15th and the 16th centuries. History The fortress, established in 1492 during the reign of Ivan III of Moscow, took its name (literally: Ivan-town ‚Äî gorod in Russian means \\"town\\" or \\"city\\") from that of the Tsar. Between 1581 and 1590 and from 1612 to 1704, Sweden controlled the area. Ivangorod was granted town privileges and administered as a Russian township under the Crown of Sweden (who conquered it in 1612 from boyar Teuvo Aminev) until 1649, when its burghers were ordered to remove to a Narva suburb. In 1617 Russia and Sweden signed the Treaty of Stolbovo, which placed the area under Swedish sovereignty. Russia reconquered it during the Great Northern War in 1704. Despite other changes in territory and sovereignty, Ivangorod was considered an administrative part of the town of Narva from 1649 until 1945. In 1780, Ivangorod, together with Narva, was included into Narvsky Uyezd of St. Petersburg Governorate. In 1796, Narvsky Uyezd was abolished and merged into Yamburgsky Uyezd. The Ivangorod Fortress in 1616 During the Estonian War of Independence (1918-1920), the newly independent Republic of Estonia established control over the whole of Narva, including Ivangorod, in January 1919, a move which Soviet Russia recognized in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu. In January 1945 Soviet authorities defined the Narva River as the border between the Estonian SSR and Russian SFSR, and as a result the administration of Ivangorod transferred from Narva to the Kingiseppsky District of Leningrad Oblast. Having grown in population, Ivangorod gained town status on October 28, 1954. After the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, there have been some disputes about the Estonian-Russian border in the Narva area, as the new constitution of Estonia (adopted in 1992) recognizes the 1920 Treaty of Tartu border to be currently legal. The Russian Federation, however, regards Estonia as a successor of the Estonian SSR and recognizes the 1945 border between two former national republics. Officially, Estonia has no territorial claims in the area, which is also reflected in the new Estonian-Russian border treaty, according to which Ivangorod remains a part of Russia. Although the foreign ministers of Estonia and Russia signed the treaty in 2005, due to continuing political tensions it has not been ratified. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated within Kingiseppsky District as Ivangorodskoye Settlement Municipal Formation.Oblast Law #32-oz As a municipal division, Ivangorodskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Kingiseppsky Municipal District as Ivangorodskoye Urban Settlement.Law #81-oz Restricted access The town of Ivangorod is included into the border security zone, intended to protect the borders of Russia from unwanted activity.

It provides a method of escape in the event of a fire or other emergency that makes the stairwells inside a building inaccessible. Fire escapes are most often found on multiple-story residential buildings, such as apartment buildings. At one time, they were a very important aspect of fire safety for all new construction in urban areas; more recently, however, they have fallen out of common use. This is due to the improved building codes incorporating fire detectors, technologically advanced fire fighting equipment, which includes better communications and the reach of fire fighting ladder trucks, and more importantly fire sprinklers. The international building codes and other authoritative agencies have incorporated fire sprinklers into multi-story buildings below 15 storeys and not just skyscrapers. A fire escape consists of a number of horizontal platforms, one at each story of a building, with ladders or stairs connecting them. The platform and stairs are usually open steel gratings, to prevent the build-up of ice, snow, and leaves. Railings are usually provided on each of the levels, but as fire escapes are designed for emergency use only, these railings often do not need to meet the same standards as railings in other contexts. The ladder from the lowest level of the fire escape to the ground may be fixed, but more commonly it swings down on a hinge or slides down along a track. The moveable designs allow occupants to safely reach the ground in the event of a fire but prevent people from accessing the fire escape from the ground at other times (such as to perpetrate a burglary or vandalism). New York. Exit from the interior of a building to the fire escape may be provided by a fire exit door, but in most cases the only exit is through a window. When there is a door, it is often fitted with a fire alarm to prevent other uses of the fire escape, and to prevent unauthorized entry. As many fire escapes were built before the advent of electronic fire alarms, fire escapes in older buildings have often needed to be retrofitted with alarms for this purpose. An alternate form of rapid-exit fire escape developed in the early 1900s was a long canvas tube suspended below a large funnel outside the window of a tall building. A person escaping the fire would slide down the interior of the tube, and could control the speed of descent by pushing outward on the tube walls with their arms and legs. This escape tube could be rapidly deployed from a window and hung down to street level, though it was large and bulky to store inside the building.1918 News article about an elastic canvas fire escape chute -- Keep a Fire-Escape Under the Window-Sill, Popular Science monthly, December 1918, page 47, Scanned by Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA47 A modern type of evacuation slide is the vertical spiral escape chute, which is a common means of evacuation for buildings and other structures. History One of the first fire escapes of any type was invented in 18th-century England. In 1784, Daniel Maseres, of England, invented a machine called a fire escape, which, being fastened to the window, would enable a person to descend to the street without injury. Abraham Wivell created an improved design, including an escape chute, after becoming superintendent of the \\"Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire.\\"Biography for Abraham Wivell Henry Vieregg patented the first US fire escape in Grand Island, NE in November 8, 1898 , serial number 681,672, which was designed for traveling businessmen. Houghton's portable fire escape 1877As building codes became more common in countries around the turn of the 20th century, fire safety became an important concern for new construction. Building owners were increasingly required to provide adequate escape routes, and at the time, fire escapes seemed the best option available. Not only could they be included in new construction at a low cost, but they could be very easily added to existing construction. As building codes evolved and more safety concerns addressed over subsequent editions, all construction above a certain number of stories was required to have a second means of egress, and external fire escapes were allowed as a retrofit option for existing buildings prior to the post-World War II period. In the 1930s, the enclosed tubular chute type fire escape became widely accepted for schools, hospitals and other institution replaced the open iron ladder type. Its main advantage was people would have no reason to use it for anything other than a fire escape and patients could be slid down it in a fire on their bedding.\\"Fire Victims Slide Safely Down Tubular Chute\\" Popular Mechanics, February 1930 East 4th Street, Cleveland. However, with the rise of urban sprawl in the mid-20th century, particularly the increase in public housing in cities in the United States and Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, certain problems with fire escapes became clear. In the poorer areas of several major American cities, such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh, fire escapes were commonly used for everything but their intended purpose. In the hot summer months, residents of mid-rise apartment buildings would sleep outside on the platforms of their fire escapes. Such a situation triggered the plot premise of Cornell Woolrich's 1947 short story, \\"The Boy Cried Murder\\", about a boy on a fire escape who one night witnesses a murder in a neighboring apartment; this story was filmed as the suspense thriller The Window (1949). The practice of sleeping on fire escapes can also be seen in Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 movie Rear Window (also based on a Woolrich short story), as well as Weegee's photography of the Lower East Side). Diagonal shadows of fire escapes made them a constant motif in film noir, and the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet was transposed to a fire escape for the musical West Side Story. The installation of window air conditioners in individual apartment units with fire escape-facing windows, often installed against code or local ordinance by residents, which require the unit to be affixed to the window sash, also make a fire escape nearly useless in the summer months; the bulk and weight of an air conditioner unit shoved onto or over a fire escape in an emergency also creates additional danger for firefighters and evacuees. Boston Herald American photographer Stanley Forman won a 1976 Pulitzer Prize for the photograph Fire Escape Collapse capturing two girls plunging from a faulty fire escape during a 1975 Boston fire, and the controversial image resulted in tougher fire safety codes in some jurisdictions. High-rise fire escapes As buildings are built taller and taller, new fire escape ideas have been gaining popularity. Elevators, though traditionally not used as fire escapes, are now being thought of as a possible evacuation for high-rises and skyscrapers. Other alternate high-rise fire escape solutions include parachutes, external collapsible elevators, and slides. Residential The use of a fire escape is dictated by various local, state, and agreed upon international building codes, such as standards provided by the International Code Council (ICC), the International Building Code (IBC), or the International Energy Conservation Code. Both the 2012 IBC and 2012 IRC require emergency escape and rescue openings for residential buildings of 4 floors or less, in sleeping rooms and basements with habitable space, for means of emergency egress. A fire escape can be a window, and if above the first floor with an approved ladder, or door that leads to a porch with ground access or a fire escape ladder.Architectural Testing: Exit requirements- Retrieved 2017-08-30 Federal rules, such as those of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), have requirements that follow ICC codes.HUD ruling- Retrieved 2017-08-30 In literature The fire escape is often regarded as one of the important symbols in the drama The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams. Its name is said to be \\"a touch of accidental poetic truth, for all of these huge buildings are always burning with the slow and implacable fires of human desperation\\". At certain points in the drama, the fire-escape even accentuates the characteristics of the characters. Tom, the character most intertwined with the fire-escape, appears on it more often than others. In most of his appearances on the fire-escape, he is moving out of the apartment, a gesture showing his yearnings to venture into the outside world, escaping troubles at home.

While Stewart's records routinely got bad reviews in the press, a brief but particularly scathing review in Billboard\\"Popular Record Reviews\\", Billboard, March 14, 1953, p. 42 may have earned the record enough publicity to chart on the magazine's own charts and prompted radio stations to play it. One radio disc jockey disparaged the record on-air as \\"the worst record (he had) ever heard\\" when playing it, and the record's poor quality inspired those in the music industry to record intentionally bad songs under the logic that if Stewart's record could be a hit, so could theirs (one example being \\"There's a New Sound\\" which purports to popularize the sounds made by worms). ; \\"!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT\\", Napoleon XIV (1966) : This record consists solely of \\"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!,\\" a novelty hit for Jerry Samuels under the Napoleon XIV stage name, played in reverse.

Japanese-English Character Dictionary. page 246 was the lead ship of twenty-four s, built for the Imperial Japanese Navy following World War I. When introduced into service, these ships were the most powerful destroyers in the world. They served as first-line destroyers through the 1930s, and remained formidable weapons systems well into the Pacific War. Fubuki was a veteran of many of the major battles of the first year of the war, and was sunk in Ironbottom Sound during the Battle of Cape Esperance in World War II. History Construction of the advanced Fubuki-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal year 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare p.1040 The Fubuki class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated . The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun page 221-222. Fubuki, built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal was laid down on 19 June 1926, launched on 15 November 1927 and commissioned on 10 August 1928. Originally assigned hull designation \\"Destroyer No. 35\\", she was completed as Fubuki. =World War II service= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Fubuki was assigned to Destroyer Division 11 of Destroyer Squadron 3 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and had deployed from Kure Naval District to Hainan Island. From 4 December 1941 Fubuki along with , the heavy cruisers and formed the Support Force of Rear- Admiral Takeo Kurita for the Japanese invasion convoy from Camranh Bay, French Indochina to Miri (British Borneo) then to Kuching. Sagiri was sunk by Dutch submarine near Kuching on 24 December 1941. Fubuki was next involved in supporting the Malaya operations. On 10 January 1942, Fubuki assisted the destroyers and in rescuing survivors of the torpedoed transport Akita Maru, which had been sunk by the Dutch submarine . On 27 January, Fubuki and her convoy were attacked by the destroyers and about north of Singapore in the Battle off Endau, and her torpedoes are credited with helping sink Thanet.Brown. Warship Losses of World War Two On 13‚Äì18 February 1942, Fubuki was assigned to \\"Operation L\\", the invasion of Bangka and Palembang, on Sumatra in the Netherlands East Indies, and took part in attacks on Allied shipping fleeing from Singapore. Fubuki assisted in the sinking or capture of at least seven vessels during this operation. On 27 February 1942, Fubuki was assigned to \\"Operation J\\", covering forces landing on the western portion of Java. On 1 March, the Australian cruiser and American cruiser sailed at top speed to Sunda Strait and encountered Fubuki at about 22.30, which was guarding the Eastern approaches, she fired nine torpedoes at about and retreated. During the Battle of Sunda Strait Perth and Houston were both sunk. Fubuki has often been accused of launching the torpedo spread that accidentally sank four Japanese transports and a minesweeper during this battle, but recent research indicates the cruiser the more likely agent.Mark Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Heavy Cruisers 1941-45 On 12 March 1942, Fubuki was part of the escort Admiral Jizaburo Ozawa's cover force for \\"Operation T\\" (the invasion of northern Sumatra). On 23 March, she escorted Admiral Ozawa's cover force for the \\"Operation D\\", the invasion of the Andaman Islands; then she served patrol and escort duties out of Port Blair (Andaman Islands) during the Japanese raids into the Indian Ocean. On 13‚Äì22 April she returned from Singapore via Camranh Bay to Kure Naval Arsenal, then docked for maintenance. On 4‚Äì5 June 1942, Fubuki participated in the Battle of Midway as part of the escort for Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's Main Body. Fubuki provided antiaircraft protection during the American air attacks, which sank and badly damaged Mogami. On 30 June‚Äì2 July 1942, Fubuki escorted a troop convoy from Kure to Amami-≈åshima, then conducted antisubmarine patrols there. On 17‚Äì31 July, Fubuki sailed from Amami-≈åshima via Mako, Singapore and Sabang to Mergui (Burma) for Indian Ocean raiding operations, which were aborted due to the American invasion of Guadalcanal.

The ship was named after Mount Furutaka, located on Etajima, Hiroshima immediately behind the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy. It was commissioned in 1926 and was sunk 12 October 1942 by and at the Battle of Cape Esperance. Design Furutaka and her sister ship Kako were the first generation of high speed heavy cruisers in the Japanese navy, intended to counter the American and British scout cruisers. They developed the experimental design pioneered in the cruiser . Although there were attempts to minimise weight and protection was only designed to be proof against 6 inch shells, the displacement was seriously overweight. The two ships were \\"scout cruisers\\", designed with aircraft facilities. The lack of catapults, however, necessitated launches from water until a major refit in 1932/3. Service historyInter-war period= Furutaka in Nagasaki, 1926 Furutaka was initially assigned to Cruiser Division 5 where she remained until reduced to reserve in December 1931. Furutaka underwent a series of significant refits in the 1930s. She was reconstructed and modernized at Kure Naval Base in 1932-33, receiving anti-aircraft guns upgraded to 4.7 inch, aircraft catapult and an E4N2 floatplane. She was recommissioned into Cruiser Division 6. Further extensive work started in April 1937. The six single-mount 7.9 inch guns were replaced by three dual mount and re-bored 8 inch guns installed in improved mountings (allowing 55¬∞ elevation) with two turrets forward and one aft, fire control changed, light anti aircraft weapons augmented and eight new 24 inch Type 93 torpedo tubes were installed. Facilities were upgraded for two E7K2 floatplanes. New oil-fired boilers were installed and there was a general overhaul of machinery. In the light of the added top weight, an attempt was made to maintain stability by increasing the ship's beam - not entirely successfully. =World War II= In late 1941, Furutaka was assigned to Cruiser Division 6 Rear Admiral Aritomo Goto in the First Fleet with the cruisers , and . At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the division was engaged in support for the invasion of Guam. After the failed first invasion of Wake Cruiser Division 6 was assigned to the larger second invasion force, and after the fall of Wake, returned to its forward base in Truk, Caroline Islands. From 18 January 1942, Cruiser Division 6 was assigned to support Japanese troop landings at Rabaul, New Britain and Kavieng, New Ireland and in patrols around the Marshall Islands in unsuccessful pursuit of the American fleet. In March‚ÄìApril, Cruiser Division 6 provided support to Cruiser Division 18 in covering the landings of Japanese troops in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea at Buka, Shortland, Kieta, Manus Island, Admiralty Islands and Tulagi from a forward base at Rabaul. While at Shortland on 6 May 1942, Furutaka was attacked by four Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, but was not damaged. Battle of the Coral Sea At the Battle of the Coral Sea, Cruiser Division 6 departed Shortland and effected a rendezvous at sea with light aircraft carrier . At 11:00 on 7 May 1942, north of Tugali Island, Shoho was attacked and sunk by 93 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from and .

Furutaka and Kinugasa, undamaged in the battle, escorted Sh≈çkaku back to Truk. Furutaka returned to Kure on 5 June for repairs, and returned to Truk on 7 July. In a major reorganization of the Japanese navy on 14 July, Furutaka was assigned to the newly created Eighth Fleet under Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa and was assigned to patrols around the Solomon Islands, New Britain and New Ireland. Battle of Savo Island In the Battle of Savo Island on 9 August 1942, Cruiser Division 6, the heavy cruiser , light cruisers and and destroyer engaged the Allied forces in a night gun and torpedo action. At about 23:00, Ch≈çkai, Furutaka and Kako all launched their reconnaissance floatplanes. The circling floatplanes dropped flares illuminating the targets and all the Japanese ships opened fire. The heavy cruisers , and were sunk and was scuttled. Heavy cruiser was damaged as were the destroyers and . On the Japanese side, Ch≈çkai was hit three times, Kinugasa twice, Aoba once and Furutaka was not damaged and returned to Kavieng on 10 August. In late August, Cruiser Division 6 and Ch≈çkai departed Shortland to provide distant cover for the Guadalcanal reinforcement convoys. That same day, a Consolidated PBY Catalina of VP23's \\"Black Cats\\" unsuccessfully attacked Furutaka in daylight. Furutaka shuttled between Kieta and Rabaul as needed to refuel and resupply through mid-September. The submarine attacked Furutaka south of New Ireland on 12 September, but did no damage. Battle of Cape Esperance So alerted, the American heavy cruisers and , and light cruisers and ‚Äîall equipped with radar‚Äîand five destroyers steamed around the end of Guadalcanal to block the entrance to Savo Sound. At 22:35, Helenas radar spotted the Japanese fleet, and the Americans successfully crossed the Japanese \\"T\\". Both fleets opened fire, but Admiral Goto, thinking that he was under friendly fire, ordered a 180-degree turn that exposed each of his ships to the American broadsides. Aoba was damaged heavily, and Admiral Goto was mortally wounded on her bridge. With Aoba crippled, Captain Araki of Furutaka turned his ship out of the line of battle to engage Salt Lake City. Destroyer launched two torpedoes toward Furutaka that either missed or failed to detonate. Duncan continued firing at Furutaka until she was put out of action by numerous shell hits. At 23:54, Furutaka was hit by a torpedo that flooded her forward engine room. During the battle, about 90 shells hit Furutaka and some ignited her Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedoes, starting fires. At 02:28 on 12 October, Furutaka sank stern first at . Captain Araki and 514 survivors were rescued by the destroyers , and . Thirty-three crewmen were killed and 110 were later counted as missing. The Americans took 115 of Furutakas crew as prisoners of war, including her Operations Officer, LtCdr. Shotaro Matsui. Most of these surviving crew were imprisoned at the Featherston prisoner of war camp in New Zealand. Furutaka was removed from navy list on 10 November 1942. Wreck The wreck of Furutaka was discovered on 25 February 2019 by the research vessel, in of water. The ship rests in two pieces with the bow broken off and lying on its port side and the rest of the ship sitting upright.

Sudbury and its suburban municipalities were amalgamated into the city of Greater Sudbury in 2000. During the transition period Courtemanche was strongly critical of a plan for the new city councillors to be designated as part-time rather than full-time workers. He argued that the demands on councillors would be greater after amalgamation and that part-time status would result in bureaucrats controlling city hall.Denis St. Pierre, \\"City councillor blasts changes to new council\\", Sudbury Star, 12 June 2000, A3.

It is owned by the Pakistan Cricket Board. It was designed by architect and civil engineer Nasreddin Murat-Khan, and constructed by Mian Abdul Khaliq and Company in 1959. The stadium was renovated for the 1996 Cricket World Cup when it hosted the final. The headquarters of the Pakistan Cricket Board are situated at Gaddafi Stadium making it the home of the Pakistan national cricket team. The stadium has a capacity of 27,000 seats, making it one of the biggest in Pakistan.  Ground history  Originally Lahore Stadium, the ground was renamed in 1974 in honour of the former Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi following a speech he gave at the 2nd Organisation of the Islamic Conference meeting in Lahore in favour of Pakistan's right to pursue nuclear weapons. The stadium houses the headquarters of the Pakistan Cricket Board. In 1995‚Äì96, the Gaddafi Stadium was renovated by architect Nayyar Ali Dada - who is qualified from National College of Arts Lahore - for the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Dada's redesign was done in the Mughal style, with red, hand-laid brickwork and arches. Dada also had plastic seating installed in place of the existing concrete benches. The lower portion under the stands was enclosed and converted to shops for boutiques and offices. Gaddafi Stadium was the first in Pakistan to be equipped with modern floodlights having their own standby power generators. On 23 October 2011, Pakistan Cricket Board discussed renaming the stadium following the death of Gaddafi, to support the new government in Libya. The Punjab Olympic Association made a similar request in late October 2011 to the provincial chief minister, \\"I don't think his profile is inspirational enough to link with our cricket stadium's identity.\\" , however, it does not appear that the stadium's name will be changed after all. Gaddafi Stadium being the largest cricket stadium in Pakistan used to have capacity of 60,000 spectators, until the redesigning of its enclosures reduced the capacity to 27,000.  Cricket history  In 1968, a Test match, played against England, was affected due to riots.https://www.dawn.com/news/1319194 In 1977, another Test, also against England, was affected due to riots between police and spectators.https://www.dawn.com/news/1319194 Three hat-tricks have been taken at the stadium, by Peter Petherick of New Zealand against Pakistan, 9 October 1976, Wasim Akram of Pakistan against Sri Lanka, 6 March 1999 and Mohammad Sami of Pakistan against Sri Lanka. Pakistan has enjoyed some memorable moments on the ground, including a fifth-wicket stand of 281 between Javed Miandad and Asif Iqbal against New Zealand in 1976 and an innings and 324 run win against New Zealand in 2002. On 3 March 2009, the scheduled third day of second Test of 2008‚Äì09 Sri Lanka tour of Pakistan, the Sri Lankan team's convoy was attacked by armed militants at Liberty Roundabout, near Gaddafi stadium. Eight Sri Lankan players were injured, including Sri Lankan captain, Mahela Jayawardene. The Sri Lankan team was air-lifted from Gaddafi Stadium to a nearby airbase, from where they were evacuated back to Sri Lanka, this event marked the end of international cricket in Pakistan. However, on 19 May 2015, the Zimbabwe cricket team landed at the Allama Iqbal International Airport to become the first Full Member nation to tour Pakistan since March 2009. On 5 March 2017 the final of the 2017 Pakistan Super League was played in the stadium. Pakistan won both ODI and T20I series comfortably. On August 2017, PCB along with ICC started to improve international cricket in Pakistan. With that, under heavy security, PCB planned World XI tour to Pakistan for three T20Is. In August 2017, Thilanga Sumathipala, president of Sri Lanka Cricket, said that he would like to play at least one of the three T20I matches in Lahore, Pakistan during October. In March 2009, the Sri Lanka cricket team were attacked by terrorists while travelling to the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Since then, the only Test side to visit Pakistan has been Zimbabwe, when they toured during May 2015. Two of Sri Lanka's current team, Chamara Kapugedera and Suranga Lakmal were on the bus during the 2009 terrorist attack, and both could have been selected for the T20I squad for this series. In September 2017, the fixtures were confirmed, with the final T20I match of the series scheduled to be played in Lahore. Sri Lanka Cricket said that players have a \\"contractual obligation\\" to play the match in Lahore, but it was unlikely to issue penalties to any player who chose not to visit Pakistan. However, on 14 October 2017, the Sri Lankan team expressed their reluctance to travel to Pakistan, requesting that the fixture is moved to a neutral venue. On 16 October 2017, Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that the fixture in Lahore would go ahead as planned, but their limited-overs captain, Upul Tharanga, had pulled out of the match. Despite the concerns from the players, team manager Asanka Gurusinha felt that a competitive squad would be named. On 19 October 2017, Sri Lanka's chief selector, Graham Labrooy, said that players who do not travel to Lahore would be unlikely to be selected for the other two T20I fixtures. The squad for the T20I fixtures was named two days later, with Thisara Perera selected as captain. The Sri Lankan squad arrived in Lahore under \\"extraordinary\\" security and made their way to the team's hotel in a bomb-proof bus. Ahead of the T20I in Lahore, Cricket Sri Lanka's president Thilanga Sumathipala said that the team was privileged to be in Pakistan and that he would help support the country in hosting more tours. Najam Sethi, chairman of the PCB, said that this fixture would be the start of international cricket returning to the country, with him expecting every country to play in Pakistan by the end of 2020. Pakistan went on to win the T20I series 3‚Äì0. A T20I match scheduled to be played against Bangladesh on 27 January 2020 at the Gaddafi stadium was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to heavy rain. The venue is also hosted some of the main matches as a part of the 2018 Blind Cricket World Cup. In September 2019, the Pakistan Cricket Board named it as one of the venues to host matches in the 2019‚Äì20 Quaid-e- Azam Trophy.

The papal bull confirming the Order of Calatrava was given by Pope Alexander III on September 26, 1164. Most of the political and military power of the order dissipated by the end of the 15th century, but the last dissolution of the order's property did not occur until 1838. Origins and foundation It was founded at Calatrava la Vieja in Castile, in the twelfth century by St. Raymond of Fitero, as a military branch of the Cistercian family.Peter Linehan, 10. The etymology of the name of this military order, Calatrava, conveys the meaning: \\"fortress of Rabah\\". Rodrigo of Toledo describes the origins of the order: Castle of Calatrava la Nueva, former parent headquarters of the order > \\"Calatrava is the Arabic name of a castle recovered from the Moslems, in > 1147, by the King of Castile, Alfonso VII, called el Emperador. Located in > what was then the southernmost border of Castile, this conquest was more > difficult to keep than to make, especially at a time with neither standing > armies nor garrisons were known. In part to correct this deficiency, the > military orders such as Knights Templars were founded, where men could > fulfill a vow of perpetual war against the Muslim. The Templars, however, > were unable to hold Calatrava, and the king found further volunteer warriors > when Raymond, Abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Fitero offered himself. > This step is said to have been suggested to the abbot by Father Diego > Vel√°zquez, a simple monk, but one who had been a knight, and thus was well > acquainted with military matters. Diego was inspired with the idea of > employing the lay brothers of the abbey to defend Calatrava. These > Cistercian lay brothers--at that time a recent innovation in monastic life-- > not being in Holy orders, were variously employed in manual trades such as > those of tending herds, construction, farm labor, or husbandry. Diego > recommended that they become soldiers of the Cross. Thus a new order was > created in 1157. Motivated by the desire for religious and pecuniary > rewards, these brethren were eager to take the offensive against the Moors. > When the Abbot Raymond died (1163), a certain Don Garc√≠a started to lead > them in battle as their first grand master. At the same time, the choir > monks, not without protest, left Calatrava to live under an abbot whom they > had chosen, in the monastery of Cirvelos.

They had already been called into the neighbouring Kingdom of Aragon, and been rewarded by a new encomienda (landed estate), that of Alca√±iz (1179). But these successes were followed by a series of misfortunes, due in the first instance to the unfortunate partition which Alfonso had made of his possessions, and the consequent rivalry which ensued between the Castilian and Leonese branches of his dynasty. On the other hand, the first successes of the Reconquista, in the 12th century, soon met up with a new wave of Islamic warriors, the invasion of the Almohads from Morocco. The first encounter resulted in a defeat for Castile. =Battle of Alarcos= After the disastrous Battle of Alarcos, the knights abandoned their bulwark of Calatrava to the Almohads (1195). Velasquez lived long enough to witness the failure of his daring scheme. He died the next year in the monastery of Gumiel (1196). The order in Castile appeared to be finished, and the branch of Aragon sought primacy. The Knights of Alca√±iz actually proceeded to elect a new grand master, but the grand master still living in Castile claimed his right. Finally, by a compromise, the master of Alca√±iz was recognized as second in dignity, with the title of Grand Commander for Aragon. The scattered remains of Castilian knights sheltered in the Cistercian monastery of Cirvelos, and there began to regroup and expand. They soon erected a new bulwark, Salvatierra Castle, where they took the name, which they kept for fourteen years, of Knights of Salvatierra (1198). But Salvatierra itself fell to the Almohad Caliphate in 1209. Summoned by Pope Innocent III, foreign crusaders joined Iberian Christians. An early battle was the reconquest of Calatrava (1212), which was returned to its former masters. In the same year the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa turned the tide of Muslim domination in Spain. Having recovered its stronghold, and resumed the title of Calatrava (1216), the order nevertheless removed to more secure quarters of Calatrava la Nueva, eight miles from old Calatrava (1218). In 1221 the Order of Monfrag√ºe was merged into that of Calatrava. With the decline of Muslim power, new orders sprang up, including the Alc√°ntara in the Kingdom of Le√≥n and Avis in Portugal. Both began under Calatrava's protection and the visitation of its grand master. This age marks the climax of Iberian chivalry: it was then that King Ferdinand the Saint, after the definitive coalition of Castile and Le√≥n (1229), in (1235) captured the capital of the old caliphate, Cordova, soon afterwards Murcia, Ja√©n, and Seville. The European crusade seemed at an end. Encouraged by these victories, Ferdinand's successor, Alfonso X, the Wise, planned a crusade in the East and contemplated marching, with his Castilian knights, to restore the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (1272). A Knight of Calatrava killing his enemy A Calatrava castle in Alca√±iz Calatrava had developed abundant resources of men and wealth, with lands and castles scattered along the borders of Castile. It exercised feudal lordship over thousands of peasants and vassals. Thus, more than once, we see the order bringing to the field, as its individual contributions, 1200 to 2000 knights, a considerable force in the Middle Ages. Moreover, it enjoyed autonomy, being by its constitutions independent in temporal matters and acknowledging only spiritual superiors-- the Abbot of Morimond and, in appeal, the pope. These authorities interfered, in consequence of a schism which first broke out in 1296 through the simultaneous election of two grand masters, Garc√≠a Lopez and Gautier Perez. Lopez, dispossessed a first time by a delegate of Morimond, appealed to Pope Boniface VIII, who quashed the sentence and referred the case to the general chapter at C√Æteaux, where Lopez was re-established in his dignity (1302). Dispossessed a second time, in consequence of a quarrel with his lieutenant, Juan Nu√±ez, Lopez voluntarily resigned in favour of Nu√±ez, who had taken his place (1328), on condition that he should keep the commandery of Zurita; as this condition was violated, Lopez again, for the third time, took the title of Grand Master in Aragon, where he died in 1336. These facts sufficiently prove that after the fourteenth century the rigorous discipline and fervent observance of the order's earlier times had, under the relaxing influence of prosperity, given place to a spirit of intrigue and ambition. Peter of Castile entered into a conflict with the order. That prince had three grand masters in succession sentenced to death, as having incurred his suspicion: the first of these was beheaded (1355) on a charge of having entered into a league with the King of Aragon; the second, Esteva√±ez, having competed for the grand mastership with the king's candidate, Garc√≠a de Padilla, was murdered in the royal palace, by the king's own treacherous hand; lastly Garc√≠a de Padilla himself, a brother of the royal mistress, fell into disgrace, upon deserting the king's party for that of his half brother, Henry the Bastard, and died in prison (1369). At the same time began the encroachments of royal authority in the election of the grand master, whose power was a check upon that of the king. For instance, in 1404, Henry of Villena, Enrique de Villena, was elected twenty-fourth grand master merely through the favour of Henry III of Castile, although Villena was married, a stranger to the order, and by papal dispensation entered upon his high functions without even the preliminary of a novitiate. A schism in the order ensued and was healed only after the king's death, in 1414, when a general chapter, held at C√Æteaux, cancelled the election of Villena and acknowledged his competitor, Luis Gonz√°lez de Guzm√°n, as the only legitimate master. After the death of Guzman in 1442, a new encroachment of John II of Castile gave rise to a new schism. He had succeeded in forcing upon the electors his own candidate, Alfonso, a bastard, of the royal stock of Aragon (1443); but Alfonso having joined a party formed against him, the king sought to have him deposed by the chapter of the order. This time the electors divided, and a double election issued in not fewer than three grand masters: Pedro Giron, who took possession of Calatrava; Ramirez de Guzman, who occupied the castles of Andalusia; and the bastard Alfonso of Aragon, who continued to be recognized by the knights of the Aragonese branch. At last, through the withdrawal of his rivals one after the other, Pedro Giron remained the only grand master (1457). Giron belonged to an eminent Castilian family descending from Portugal; an ambitious intriguer, more anxious about his family interests than about those of his order, he played an important part as a leader in the factions which disturbed the wretched reigns of John II and Henry IV, the last two lamentably weak descendants of St. Ferdinand of Castile. The Italian left By turns, Giron sustained first Henry IV, in a war against his father, John II, then Alfonso, who pretended to the throne, against Henry IV. Such was Giron's importance that Henry IV, to attach him to his cause, offered him the hand of his own sister, Isabella I of Castile. Giron had already had his vow of celibacy annulled by the pope, and was on his way to the court, when he died, thus saving the future Queen of Castile from an unworthy consort (1466). The same pope, Pius II, granted to Pedro Giron the extravagant privilege of resigning his high dignity in favour of his bastard, Rodrigo Telles Giron, a child eight years old. Thus the grand mastership fell into the hands of guardians‚Äîan unheard of event. The Abbot of Morimond was called upon to devise a temporary administration, until Telles should reach his majority. The administration was entrusted to four knights elected by the chapter, and from this period date the definitive statutes of the order known as \\"Rules of Abbot William III\\" (1467). These statutes recognized in the order seven high dignitaries: the grand master; the clavero (guardian of the castle and lieutenant of the grand master); two grand comendadores, one for Castile and the other for Aragon; the grand prior, representing the Abbot of Morimond in the spiritual government; the sacristan (guardian of the relics); and the obrero (supervisor of buildings). The order, having reached its apogee of prosperity, now held sway over fifty-six commanderies and sixteen priories, or cures, distributed between the Diocese of Ja√©n and the Vicariate of Ciudad Real. Its lordships included sixty-four villages, with a population of 200,000 souls, and produced an annual income estimated at 50,000 ducats. The kings whose fortune the mismanagement of the late reigns had depleted could not but covet these riches, while such formidable military power filled with distrust the monarchs who were obliged to tolerate the autonomous existence of the order. During the struggle between Afonso V of Portugal and Ferdinand of Aragon for the right of succession to Henry IV of Castile, the last male of his house (1474), much depended upon the attitude of Calatrava. The knights were divided. While the grand master, Rodrigo Giron, supported Portugal, his lieutenant, Lopez de Padilla, stood by Aragon. The battle of Toro (1479), where the pretensions of Portugal were annihilated, ended this schism, the last in the history of the order. The grand master, reconciled with Ferdinand of Aragon, fell, during the war against the Moors, at the siege of Loja (1482). His lieutenant, Lopez de Padilla, succeeded him and, as the last of the twenty-seven independent grand masters of Calatrava, revived for a season the heroic virtues of his order's better days. A mortified monk in his cell, a fearless warrior on the battlefield, the glory of Padilla shed its last rays in the war of the conquest of Granada, which he did not live to see completed. After the fall of Granada At Padilla's death (1487), Ferdinand of Aragon exhibited to the chapter, assembled for the election of a new grand master, a Bull from Innocent VIII that invested him with authority to administer the order, and to this decree he compelled the electors to submit. Thus ended the political autonomy of the Order of Calatrava. The reason of its being--the struggle against the Moors‚Äîseemed, indeed, to end with the fall of Granada (1492). Diego Vel√°zquez (1631) Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth. The canonical bond between Calatrava and Morimond had been relaxing more and more. The King of Spain was too jealous of his authority to tolerate any foreign--especially French--intervention in the affairs of his kingdom. The canonical visits of the Abbot of Morimond ceased; difficulties were raised when the grand prior came from Morimond to take possession of his dignity. The last French prior was Nicholas of Avesnes, who died in 1552. After a long contest, a compromise was effected in 1630, leaving to Morimond its right of electing the grand prior, but limiting its choice to Spanish Cistercians. Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540). As members of the order were allowed to found families, and were authorized by Julius III (1551) to make free use of their personal property, the vow of poverty also passed into virtual desuetude. In 1652, under Philip IV, the three Spanish orders took a new vow: that of defending the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. This was the last manifestation of any religious spirit in the orders. The military spirit, too, had long since disappeared. The orders had, in fact, fallen into a state of utter inactivity. The commanderies were but so many pensions at the king's free disposal, and predictably granted by him to the high-born rather than to the deserving in character, whatever their social status. In 1628 the Order of Calatrava was declared to be inaccessible not only to tradesmen, but even to sons of tradesmen. The last attempt to employ the knights of the three orders for a military purpose was that of Philip IV, in quelling the rebellion of the Catalans (1640‚Äì50), but the orders restricted their efforts to the complete equipment of one regiment, which has since been known in the Spanish army as \\"The Regiment of the Orders\\". In 1750 the singer Farinelli was made a Knight of the Order of Calatrava. When the Bourbon dynasty occupied the throne, Charles III, having founded the personal order of his name, levied upon the old orders a contribution of a million reals to pension 200 knights of the new order (1775). Their revenues being the only remaining raison d'√™tre of the order, confiscation necessarily led to dissolution. Confiscated by King Joseph (1808), re-established by Ferdinand VII at the Restoration (1814), the possessions of Calatrava were finally dissipated in the general secularization of 1838.

The parish is located on the northern slopes of the Weald, south-west of Tonbridge. The old High Street has Grade II listed cottages and village houses, and there is an inn called The Fountain. At the 2011 Census the population of the village was 818. History The Romans built the London to Lewes Way across what is now the garden of Waystrode Manor. The first owners of the manor received it from King John in 1208. Crippenden Manor, built in about 1607, was once the home of ironmaster, Richard Tichborne (1568-1639), related to the Tichbornes of Tichborne, Hampshire. This branch of the Tichbornes descended from a younger son of John Tichborne and Margaret Martin, who inherited his mother's lands in and around Edenbridge, including Crippenden. Richard was the son of John Tichborne (c1549-1620) and Dorothy Chaloner, daughter of Thomas Chaloner of Lyndfield and his wife, Alice Shirley. Richard married Dorothy Saxbie, circa 1592, and had at least ten children, including Dorothy who married John Tillinghast (1604‚Äì55), son of the Rector of Streat, who was also involved in the iron industry. Richard formally leased Crippenden from 1612 and built the house there. It descended to Captain Edmund Tichborne who sold the manor after 1721. The village appears as Cudena in Textus Roffensis. In 1649 Robert Tichborne, a nephew of Richard Tichborne, petitioned the House of Commons in favour of the execution of Charles I. He was one of the Commissioners who, in 1651, prepared the way for the union with Scotland; he was knighted in 1655 by Cromwell, and was elevated to the peerage in 1657. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, he was arrested and sentenced to death, but was reprieved, imprisoned in Dover Castle and died, in 1682, in the Tower of London. The family, however, did not die out in Cowden until 1708, when the last member of the family, John Tichbourne, was buried there. This is old Wealden iron country, recalled by the cast iron memorial slab in the church, to John Bottinge, dated 1622. This was a time when the area was producing guns for the Army and Navy, as well as domestic and agricultural ware. Cowden had its own blast furnace from 1573 until sometime in the 18th century.

Parts of the parish straddle the Kent Water which forms the border with East Sussex and Surrey where the three counties meet. It is centred on a 13th-century church of St Mary Magdalene with its slender, wooden shingled spire, bomb-damaged during World War II and since re- shingled. The spire is barely perceptibly out of perpendicular, which gave rise to a rhyme: The church is built of sandstone, its tower and steeple timber-framed inside. The old bells were recast and rehung in 1911 to commemorate the reign of Edward VII and a sixth bell was added at the Coronation of George V. A stained glass window given to the church in 1947, celebrates 'the remarkable preservation of this village during the years 1939-45' and features figures of St Bridget (representing the women of the parish), St Nicholas (for the sailors), St George (the soldiers and airmen), and St Mary Magdalene, all the company of Sir Walstan (the farmer bishop of Worcester Wulfstan (1062‚Äì95) representing the local farmers).

He taught at universities in Dijon and Grenoble in the late 1930s. Jeanneney was his father's Chief of Staff during the provisional government (1944‚Äì1946). In 1958, the younger Jeanneney was appointed by Jacques Rueff to the Rueff- Pinay committee, a group of experts on economic reform whose ultimate product, the Rueff-Pinay plan, lowered French tariffs, returned the French franc to full convertibility after re-evaluating it, and reformed financial markets.

BPR aimed to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors.Business Process Re-engineering Assessment Guide, United States General Accounting Office, May 1997. BPR seeks to help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes. According to early BPR proponent Thomas H. Davenport (1990), a business process is a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome. Re-engineering emphasized a holistic focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full-scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes. Business process reengineering is also known as business process redesign, business transformation, or business process change management.  Overview  Reengineering guidance and relationship of mission and work processes to information technology. Business process reengineering (BPR) is the practice of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's mission and reduce costs. Organizations reengineer two key areas of their businesses. First, they use modern technology to enhance data dissemination and decision-making processes. Then, they alter functional organizations to form functional teams. Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and customer needs. Basic questions are asked, such as \\"Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?\\" An organization may find that it is operating on questionable assumptions, particularly in terms of the wants and needs of its customers. Only after the organization rethinks what it should be doing, it does go on to decide how best to do it. Within the framework of this basic assessment of mission and goals, re-engineering focuses on the organization's business processes‚Äîthe steps and procedures that govern how resources are used to create products and services that meet the needs of particular customers or markets. As a structured ordering of work steps across time and place, a business process can be decomposed into specific activities, measured, modeled, and improved. It can also be completely redesigned or eliminated altogether. Re-engineering identifies, analyzes, and re-designs an organization's core business processes with the aim of achieving improvements in critical performance measures, such as cost, quality, service, and speed. Re-engineering recognizes that an organization's business processes are usually fragmented into sub-processes and tasks that are carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one is responsible for the overall performance of the entire process. Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re- designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.  History  BPR began as a private sector technique to help organizations rethink how they do their work in order to improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world- class competitors. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of information systems and networks. Organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work. = Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate, 1990 = In 1990, Michael Hammer, a former professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published the article \\"Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate\\" in the Harvard Business Review, in which he claimed that the major challenge for managers is to obliterate forms of work that do not add value, rather than using technology for automating it.Michael Hammer, \\"Reengineering Work: Don‚Äôt Automate, Obliterate\\", Hardvard Business Review, July, 1990 This statement implicitly accused managers of having focused on the wrong issues, namely that technology in general, and more specifically information technology, has been used primarily for automating existing processes rather than using it as an enabler for making non-value adding work obsolete. Hammer's claim was simple: Most of the work being done does not add any value for customers, and this work should be removed, not accelerated through automation. Instead, companies should reconsider their inability to satisfy customer needs, and their insufficient cost structure. Even well-established management thinkers, such as Peter Drucker and Tom Peters, were accepting and advocating BPR as a new tool for (re-)achieving success in a dynamic world.Forbes: Reengineering, The Hot New Managing Tool, 23 August 1993 During the following years, a fast- growing number of publications, books as well as journal articles, were dedicated to BPR, and many consulting firms embarked on this trend and developed BPR methods. However, the critics were fast to claim that BPR was a way to dehumanize the work place, increase managerial control, and to justify downsizing, i.e. major reductions of the work force,(Greenbaum 1995, Industry Week 1994) and a rebirth of Taylorism under a different label. Despite this critique, reengineering was adopted at an accelerating pace and by 1993, as many as 60% of the Fortune 500 companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so.Hamscher, Walter: \\"AI in Business-Process Reengineering\\" , AI Magazine Volume 15 Number 4, 1994 This trend was fueled by the fast adoption of BPR by the consulting industry, but also by the study Made in America,Michael L. Dertouzos, Robert M. Solow and Richard K. Lester (1989) Made in America: Regaining the Productive Edge. MIT press. conducted by MIT, that showed how companies in many US industries had lagged behind their foreign counterparts in terms of competitiveness, time-to- market and productivity..... = Development after 1995 = With the publication of critiques in 1995 and 1996 by some of the early BPR proponents, coupled with abuses and misuses of the concept by others, the reengineering fervor in the U.S. began to wane. Since then, considering business processes as a starting point for business analysis and redesign has become a widely accepted approach and is a standard part of the change methodology portfolio, but is typically performed in a less radical way than originally proposed. More recently, the concept of Business Process Management (BPM) has gained major attention in the corporate world and can be considered a successor to the BPR wave of the 1990s, as it is evenly driven by a striving for process efficiency supported by information technology. Equivalently to the critique brought forward against BPR, BPM is now accused of focusing on technology and disregarding the people aspects of change......  Topics  The most notable definitions of reengineering are: * \\"... the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve ... improvements in critical contemporary modern measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.\\"Hammer and Champy (1993) * \\"encompasses the envisioning of new work strategies, the actual process design activity, and the implementation of the change in all its complex technological, human, and organizational dimensions.\\"Thomas H. Davenport (1993) BPR is different from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the continuous improvement or TQM movement, by virtue of its aim for fundamental and radical change rather than iterative improvement.Johansson et al. (1993): \\"Business Process Reengineering, although a close relative, seeks radical rather than merely continuous improvement. It escalates the efforts of JIT and TQM to make process orientation a strategic tool and a core competence of the organization. BPR concentrates on core business processes, and uses the specific techniques within the JIT and TQM ‚Äùtoolboxes\\" as enablers, while broadening the process vision.\\" In order to achieve the major improvements BPR is seeking for, the change of structural organizational variables, and other ways of managing and performing work is often considered insufficient. For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of information technology (IT) is conceived as a major contributing factor. While IT traditionally has been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as enabler of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations. BPR derives its existence from different disciplines, and four major areas can be identified as being subjected to change in BPR ‚Äì organization, technology, strategy, and people ‚Äì where a process view is used as common framework for considering these dimensions. Business strategy is the primary driver of BPR initiatives and the other dimensions are governed by strategy's encompassing role. The organization dimension reflects the structural elements of the company, such as hierarchical levels, the composition of organizational units, and the distribution of work between them. Technology is concerned with the use of computer systems and other forms of communication technology in the business. In BPR, information technology is generally considered to act as enabler of new forms of organizing and collaborating, rather than supporting existing business functions. The people / human resources dimension deals with aspects such as education, training, motivation and reward systems. The concept of business processes ‚Äì interrelated activities aiming at creating a value added output to a customer ‚Äì is the basic underlying idea of BPR. These processes are characterized by a number of attributes: Process ownership, customer focus, value adding, and cross-functionality. =The role of information technology= Information technology (IT) has historically played an important role in the reengineering concept.Business efficiency: IT can help paint a bigger picture, Financial Times, featuring Ian Manocha, Lynne Munns and Andy Cross It is regarded by some as a major enabler for new forms of working and collaborating within an organization and across organizational borders. BPR literaturee.g. Hammer & Champy (1993) identified several so called disruptive technologies that were supposed to challenge traditional wisdom about how work should be performed. * Shared databases, making information available at many places * Expert systems, allowing generalists to perform specialist tasks * Telecommunication networks, allowing organizations to be centralized and decentralized at the same time * Decision-support tools, allowing decision- making to be a part of everybody's job * Wireless data communication and portable computers, allowing field personnel to work office independent * Interactive videodisk, to get in immediate contact with potential buyers * Automatic identification and tracking, allowing things to tell where they are, instead of requiring to be found * High performance computing, allowing on- the-fly planning and revisioning In the mid-1990s especially, workflow management systems were considered a significant contributor to improved process efficiency. Also, ERP (enterprise resource planning) vendors, such as SAP, JD Edwards, Oracle, and PeopleSoft, positioned their solutions as vehicles for business process redesign and improvement. =Research and methodology = Model based on PRLC approach Although the labels and steps differ slightly, the early methodologies that were rooted in IT-centric BPR solutions share many of the same basic principles and elements. The following outline is one such model, based on the PRLC (Process Reengineering Life Cycle) approach developed by Guha.Guha et al. (1993) Simplified schematic outline of using a business process approach, exemplified for pharmaceutical R&D; # Structural organization with functional units # Introduction of New Product Development as cross-functional process # Re-structuring and streamlining activities, removal of non-value adding tasks Benefiting from lessons learned from the early adopters, some BPR practitioners advocated a change in emphasis to a customer-centric, as opposed to an IT-centric, methodology. One such methodology, that also incorporated a Risk and Impact Assessment to account for the effect that BPR can have on jobs and operations, was described by Lon Roberts (1994).Lon Roberts (1994) Process reengineering: the key to achieving breakthrough success. Roberts also stressed the use of change management tools to proactively address resistance to change‚Äîa factor linked to the demise of many reengineering initiatives that looked good on the drawing board. Some items to use on a process analysis checklist are: Reduce handoffs, Centralize data, Reduce delays, Free resources faster, Combine similar activities. Also within the management consulting industry, a significant number of methodological approaches have been developed.A set of short papers, outlining and comparing some of them can be found here, followed by some guidelines for companies considering to contract a consultancy for a BPR initiative: * Overview * Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) * Bain & Co. * Boston Consulting Group * McKinsey & Co. * Comparison * Guidelines for BPR consulting clients = Framework = An easy to follow seven step INSPIRE framework is developed by Bhudeb Chakravarti which can be followed by any Process Analyst to perform BPR. The seven steps of the framework are Initiate a new process reengineering project and prepare a business case for the same; Negotiate with senior management to get approval to start the process reengineering project; Select the key processes that need to be reengineered; Plan the process reengineering activities; Investigate the processes to analyze the problem areas; Redesign the selected processes to improve the performance and Ensure the successful implementation of redesigned processes through proper monitoring and evaluation.  Factors for success and failure  Factors that are important to BPR success include: # BPR team composition. # Business needs analysis. # Adequate IT infrastructure. # Effective change management. # Ongoing continuous improvement The aspects of a BPM effort that are modified include organizational structures, management systems, employee responsibilities, and performance measurements, incentive systems, skills development, and the use of IT. BPR can potentially affect every aspect of how business is conducted today. Wholesale changes can cause results ranging from enviable success to complete failure. If successful, a BPM initiative can result in improved quality, customer service, and competitiveness, as well as reductions in cost or cycle time. However, 50-70% of reengineering projects are either failures or do not achieve significant benefit.Asian Productivity Organization: Business Process re-engineering. http://www.apo- tokyo.org/productivity/pmtt_016.htm There are many reasons for sub-optimal business processes which include: # One department may be optimized at the expense of another # Lack of time to focus on improving business process # Lack of recognition of the extent of the problem # Lack of training # People involved use the best tool they have at their disposal which is usually Excel to fix problems # Inadequate infrastructure # Overly bureaucratic processes # Lack of motivation Many unsuccessful BPR attempts may have been due to the confusion surrounding BPR, and how it should be performed. Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made but did not know which areas to change or how to change them. As a result, process reengineering is a management concept that has been formed by trial and error or, in other words, practical experience. As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent.(Covert, 1997) To reap lasting benefits, companies must be willing to examine how strategy and reengineering complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organization's current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process. Otherwise, BPR is only a short-term efficiency exercise.(Berman, 1994) = Organization-wide commitment = Major changes to business processes have a direct effect on processes, technology, job roles, and workplace culture. Significant changes to even one of those areas require resources, money, and leadership. Changing them simultaneously is an extraordinary task. Like any large and complex undertaking, implementing re engineering requires the talents and energies of a broad spectrum of experts. Since BPR can involve multiple areas within the organization, it is important to get support from all affected departments. Through the involvement of selected department members, the organization can gain valuable input before a process is implemented; a step that promotes both the cooperation and the vital acceptance of the re engineered process by all segments of the organization. Getting enterprise-wide commitment involves the following: top management sponsorship, bottom-up buy-in from process users, dedicated BPR team, and budget allocation for the total solution with measures to demonstrate value. Before any BPR project can be implemented successfully, there must be a commitment to the project by the management of the organization, and strong leadership must be provided.(Campbell & Kleiner, 1997) Re engineering efforts can by no means be exercised without a company- wide commitment to the goals. However, top management commitment is imperative for success.(Dooley & Johnson, 2001)(Jackson, 1997) Top management must recognize the need for change, develop a complete understanding of what BPR is, and plan how to achieve it.(Motwani, et al., 1998) Leadership has to be effective, strong, visible, and creative in thinking and understanding in order to provide a clear vision.(Al-Mashari & Zairi, 1999) Convincing every affected group within the organization of the need for BPR is a key step in successfully implementing a process. By informing all affected groups at every stage, and emphasizing the positive end results of the re engineering process, it is possible to minimize resistance to change and increase the odds for success. The ultimate success of BPR depends on the strong, consistent, and continuous involvement of all departmental levels within the organization.(King, 1994) = Team composition = Once an organization-wide commitment has been secured from all departments involved in the re engineering effort and at different levels, the critical step of selecting a BPR team must be taken. This team will form the nucleus of the BPR effort, make key decisions and recommendations, and help communicate the details and benefits of the BPR program to the entire organization. The determinants of an effective BPR team may be summarized as follows: * competency of the members of the team, their motivation,(Rastogi, 1994) * their credibility within the organization and their creativity,(Barrett, 1994) * team empowerment, training of members in process mapping and brainstorming techniques,(Carr, 1993) * effective team leadership,(Berrington & Oblich, 1995) * proper organization of the team,(Guha, et al., 1993) * complementary skills among team members, adequate size, interchangeable accountability, clarity of work approach, and * specificity of goals.(Katzenbach & Smith, 1993) The most effective BPR teams include active representatives from the following work groups: top management, the business area responsible for the process being addressed, technology groups, finance, and members of all ultimate process users' groups. Team members who are selected from each work group within the organization will affect the outcome of the re engineered process according to their desired requirements. The BPR team should be mixed in-depth and knowledge. For example, it may include members with the following characteristics: * Members who do not know the process at all. * Members who know the process inside-out. * Customers, if possible. * Members representing affected departments. * One or two members of the best, brightest, passionate, and committed technology experts. * Members from outside of the organization Moreover, Covert (1997) recommends that in order to have an effective BPR team, it must be kept under ten players. If the organization fails to keep the team at a manageable size, the entire process will be much more difficult to execute efficiently and effectively. The efforts of the team must be focused on identifying breakthrough opportunities and designing new work steps or processes that will create quantum gains and competitive advantage. = Business needs analysis = Another important factor in the success of any BPR effort is performing a thorough business needs analysis. Too often, BPR teams jump directly into the technology without first assessing the current processes of the organization and determining what exactly needs re engineering. In this analysis phase, a series of sessions should be held with process owners and stakeholders, regarding the need and strategy for BPR. These sessions build a consensus as to the vision of the ideal business process. They help identify essential goals for BPR within each department and then collectively define objectives for how the project will affect each work group or department on an individual basis and the business organization as a whole. The idea of these sessions is to conceptualize the ideal business process for the organization and build a business process model. Those items that seem unnecessary or unrealistic may be eliminated or modified later on in the diagnosing stage of the BPR project. It is important to acknowledge and evaluate all ideas in order to make all participants feel that they are a part of this important and crucial process. The results of these meetings will help formulate the basic plan for the project. This plan includes the following: * identifying specific problem areas, * solidifying particular goals, and * defining business objectives. The business needs analysis contributes tremendously to the re-engineering effort by helping the BPR team to prioritize and determine where it should focus its improvements efforts. The business needs analysis also helps in relating the BPR project goals back to key business objectives and the overall strategic direction for the organization. This linkage should show the thread from the top to the bottom of the organization, so each person can easily connect the overall business direction with the re-engineering effort. This alignment must be demonstrated from the perspective of financial performance, customer service, associate value, and the vision for the organization. Developing a business vision and process objectives rely, on the one hand, on a clear understanding of organizational strengths, weaknesses, and market structure, and on the other, on awareness and knowledge about innovative activities undertaken by competitors and other organizations.(Vakola & Rezgui, 2000) BPR projects that are not in alignment with the organization's strategic direction can be counterproductive. There is always a possibility that an organization may make significant investments in an area that is not a core competency for the company and later outsource this capability. Such re engineering initiatives are wasteful and steal resources from other strategic projects. Moreover, without strategic alignment, the organization's key stakeholders and sponsors may find themselves unable to provide the level of support the organization needs in terms of resources, especially if there are other more critical projects to the future of the business, and are more aligned with the strategic direction. = Adequate IT infrastructure = Researchers consider adequate IT infrastructure reassessment and composition as a vital factor in successful BPR implementation. Hammer (1990) prescribes the use of IT to challenge the assumptions inherent in the work process that have existed since long before the advent of modern computer and communications technology.(Malhotra, 1998) Factors related to IT infrastructure have been increasingly considered by many researchers and practitioners as a vital component of successful BPR efforts.(Ross, 1998) * Effective alignment of IT infrastructure and BPR strategy, * Building an effective IT infrastructure, * adequate IT infrastructure investment decision, * adequate measurement of IT infrastructure effectiveness, * proper information systems (IS) integration, * effective re engineering of legacy IS, * increasing IT function competency, and * effective use of software tools is the most important factor that contributes to the success of BPR projects. These are vital factors that contribute to building an effective IT infrastructure for business processes. BPR must be accompanied by strategic planning which addresses leveraging IT as a competitive tool.(Weicher, et al., 1995) An IT infrastructure is made up of physical assets, intellectual assets, shared services,(Broadbent & Weill, 1997) and their linkages.(Kayworth, et al., 1997) The way in which the IT infrastructure components are composed and their linkages determine the extent to which information resources can be delivered. An effective IT infrastructure composition process follows a top-down approach, beginning with business strategy and IS strategy and passing through designs of data, systems, and computer architecture.(Malhotra, 1996) Linkages between the IT infrastructure components, as well as descriptions of their contexts of interaction, are important for ensuring integrity and consistency among the IT infrastructure components. Furthermore, IT standards have a major role in reconciling various infrastructure components to provide shared IT services that are of a certain degree of effectiveness to support business process applications, as well as to guide the process of acquiring, managing, and utilizing IT assets. The IT infrastructure shared services and the human IT infrastructure components, in terms of their responsibilities and their needed expertise, are both vital to the process of the IT infrastructure composition. IT strategic alignment is approached through the process of integration between business and IT strategies, as well as between IT and organizational infrastructures. Most analysts view BPR and IT as irrevocably linked. Walmart, for example, would not have been able to reengineer the processes used to procure and distribute mass-market retail goods without IT. Ford was able to decrease its headcount in the procurement department by 75 percent by using IT in conjunction with BPR, in another well-known example. The IT infrastructure and BPR are interdependent in the sense that deciding the information requirements for the new business processes determines the IT infrastructure constituents, and a recognition of IT capabilities provides alternatives for BPR. Building a responsive IT infrastructure is highly dependent on an appropriate determination of business process information needs. This, in turn, is determined by the types of activities embedded in a business process, and their sequencing and reliance on other organizational processes.(Sabherwal & King, 1991) = Effective change management = Al-Mashari and Zairi (2000) suggest that BPR involves changes in people's behavior and culture, processes, and technology. As a result, there are many factors that prevent the effective implementation of BPR and hence restrict innovation and continuous improvement. Change management, which involves all human and social related changes and cultural adjustment techniques needed by management to facilitate the insertion of newly designed processes and structures into working practice and to deal effectively with resistance, is considered by many researchers to be a crucial component of any BPR effort. One of the most overlooked obstacles to successful BPR project implementation is resistance from those whom implementer believe will benefit the most. Most projects underestimate the cultural effect of major process and structural change and as a result, do not achieve the full potential of their change effort. Many people fail to understand that change is not an event, but rather a management technique. Change management is the discipline of managing change as a process, with due consideration that employees are people, not programmable machines. Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change. An important step towards any successful reengineering effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change. It is a well-known fact that organizations do not change unless people change; the better the change is managed, the less painful the transition is. Organizational culture is a determining factor in successful BPR implementation.(Zairi & Sinclair, 1995) Organizational culture influences the organization's ability to adapt to change. Culture in an organization is a self-reinforcing set of beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. Culture is one of the most resistant elements of organizational behavior and is extremely difficult to change. BPR must consider current culture in order to change these beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors effectively. Messages conveyed from management in an organization continually enforce current culture. Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change. The first step towards any successful transformation effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change. Management rewards system, stories of company origin and early successes of founders, physical symbols, and company icons constantly enforce the message of the current culture. Implementing BPR successfully is dependent on how thoroughly management conveys the new cultural messages to the organization. These messages provide people in the organization with a guideline to predict the outcome of acceptable behavior patterns. People should be the focus of any successful business change. BPR is not a recipe for successful business transformation if it focuses on only computer technology and process redesign. In fact, many BPR projects have failed because they did not recognize the importance of the human element in implementing BPR. Understanding the people in organizations, the current company culture, motivation, leadership, and past performance is essential to recognize, understand, and integrate into the vision and implementation of BPR. If the human element is given equal or greater emphasis in BPR, the odds of successful business transformation increase substantially. = Ongoing continuous improvement = Many organizational change theorists hold a common view of organizations adjusting gradually and incrementally and responding locally to individual crises as they arise Common elements are: * BPR is a successive and ongoing process and should be regarded as an improvement strategy that enables an organization to make the move from a traditional functional orientation to one that aligns with strategic business processes. * Continuous improvement is defined as the propensity of the organization to pursue incremental and innovative improvements in its processes, products, and services. The incremental change is governed by the knowledge gained from each previous change cycle. * It is essential that the automation infrastructure of the BPR activity provides for performance measurements in order to support continuous improvements. It will need to efficiently capture appropriate data and allow access to appropriate individuals. * To ensure that the process generates the desired benefits, it must be tested before it is deployed to the end-users. If it does not perform satisfactorily, more time should be taken to modify the process until it does. * A fundamental concept for quality practitioners is the use of feedback loops at every step of the process and an environment that encourages constant evaluation of results and individual efforts to improve.(Gore, 1999) * At the end user's level, there must be a proactive feedback mechanism that provides for and facilitates resolutions of problems and issues. This will also contribute to a continuous risk assessment and evaluation which are needed throughout the implementation process to deal with any risks at their initial state and to ensure the success of the reengineering efforts. * Anticipating and planning for risk handling is important for dealing effectively with any risk when it first occurs and as early as possible in the BPR process.(Clemons, 1995) It is interesting that many of the successful applications of reengineering described by its proponents are in organizations practicing continuous improvement programs. * Hammer and Champy (1993) use the IBM Credit Corporation as well as Ford and Kodak, as examples of companies that carried out BPR successfully due to the fact that they had long-running continuous improvement programs. In conclusion, successful BPR can potentially create substantial improvements in the way organizations do business and can actually produce fundamental improvements for business operations. However, in order to achieve that, there are some key success factors that must be taken into consideration when performing BPR. BPR success factors are a collection of lessons learned from reengineering projects and from these lessons common themes have emerged. In addition, the ultimate success of BPR depends on the people who do it and on how well they can be committed and motivated to be creative and to apply their detailed knowledge to the reengineering initiative. Organizations planning to undertake BPR must take into consideration the success factors of BPR in order to ensure that their reengineering related change efforts are comprehensive, well-implemented, and have a minimum chance of failure. This has been very beneficial in all terms  Critique  Many companies used reengineering as a pretext to downsizing, though this was not the intent of reengineering's proponents; consequently, reengineering earned a reputation for being synonymous with downsizing and layoffs. In many circumstances, reengineering has not always lived up to its expectations. Some prominent reasons include: * Reengineering assumes that the factor that limits an organization's performance is the ineffectiveness of its processes (which may or may not be true) and offers no means of validating that assumption. * Reengineering assumes the need to start the process of performance improvement with a \\"clean slate,\\" i.e. totally disregard the status quo. * According to Eliyahu M. Goldratt (and his Theory of Constraints) reengineering does not provide an effective way to focus improvement efforts on the organization's constraint. Others have claimed that reengineering was a recycled buzzword for commonly- held ideas. Abrahamson (1996) argued that fashionable management terms tend to follow a lifecycle, which for Reengineering peaked between 1993 and 1996 (Ponzi and Koenig 2002). They argue that Reengineering was in fact nothing new (as e.g. when Henry Ford implemented the assembly line in 1908, he was in fact reengineering, radically changing the way of thinking in an organization). The most frequent critique against BPR concerns the strict focus on efficiency and technology and the disregard of people in the organization that is subjected to a reengineering initiative. Very often, the label BPR was used for major workforce reductions. Thomas Davenport, an early BPR proponent, stated that: > \\"When I wrote about \\"business process redesign\\" in 1990, I explicitly said > that using it for cost reduction alone was not a sensible goal. And > consultants Michael Hammer and James Champy, the two names most closely > associated with reengineering, have insisted all along that layoffs > shouldn't be the point. But the fact is, once out of the bottle, the > reengineering genie quickly turned ugly.\\"(Davenport, 1995) Hammer similarly admitted that: > \\"I wasn't smart enough about that. I was reflecting my engineering > background and was insufficiently appreciative of the human dimension. I've > learned that's critical.\\"(White, 1996)  See also  * Business process management * Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) * Kaizen * Learning agenda  References  Further reading  * Abrahamson, E.

The object of the game is to move all the cards into the foundations. It served as a partial inspiration for and is very similar to the popular solitaire game FreeCell.\\"Eight Off\\" (p.201) in Hoyle's Rules of Games (3rd edition) by Philip D. Morehead (ed.), 2001. Rules Initial Layout The cards are dealt, face up, into eight columns (or piles) of six cards each. (These eight columns make up the tableau.) The remaining four cards go into the first four cells. When dealt, the table should bear some resemblance to the picture on the right, although a layout with the cells on the left and the foundations at the top is another option. The eight slots along the top of the picture represent the cells. These cells can be used to temporarily store any available card from the table. Four of the cells are filled at the beginning of the game. The four slots along the left of the picture represent the four foundations. These, as in Klondike, are meant to be built up in suit from Ace to King. That is, each foundation begins with the Ace of one suit and is followed by the 2 of the same suit, which is followed by the 3 of the same suit, and so forth, until all the cards through the King have been placed on the foundation. The tableau piles which fill the majority of the figure are where most of the game play occurs. The cards are, again, all face up, and are built down, traditionally by suit. (Players can modify the difficulty of the game, if they like, by building down in a different manner. For example, one could play by alternating colours, the way Klondike is played). Technically, one may only move the cards between columns one at a time; however, the presence of a free cell essentially increases the number of cards that can be moved. (e.g., if there are three open cells, four cards can be moved at once‚Äîone for each cell, and the one that can always be moved.) If a column is emptied, most rules allow for one to only place Kings in the empty space, regardless of suit (as long as it follows the other restrictions on moving cards). Players, however, may prefer to simplify this rule to any card (as it is in FreeCell). Descendants Eight Off is similar to Baker's Game, which was named after the mathematician C.L. Baker. Both games were precursors to the more popular FreeCell. While not as popular as FreeCell, they are included in some collections of computer solitaire games.

Water or chicken broth is then added, along with tomatoes in the form of chopped tomatoes or tomato sauce. Despite its name, Spanish rice is not a popular dish in Spain or in Spanish cuisine; rice dishes in Spain are often yellow in color due to the inclusion of saffron. Mexican-style Spanish rice, however, is red, from being cooked with tomato sauce or tomato paste and is often referred to as \\"red rice\\" () in Mexico. In Iran and Persian cuisine, a similar dish is called Istanboli Polo (Persian: ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜÿ®ŸàŸÑ€å ŸæŸÑŸà). It dates back to Qajar Iran. It is known as Persian tomato rice in the Western world. Etymology left Although it is also called \\"Spanish rice\\", this dish is virtually unknown in Spain. The term \\"Spanish rice\\" is not used by Mexicans or Mexican food enthusiasts; the dish is usually simply referred to as (\\"rice\\") or (\\"red rice\\") in Mexico.

It is on the North London Line, and the station and all trains serving it are operated by London Overground. It is in Travelcard Zone 3. Until 1959 it was also served by the District line of the London Underground. History South Acton station was opened on 1 January 1880 by the North and South Junction Railway for North London Line trains on the London Broad Street - Richmond line. There was a connecting branch train at South Acton to Hammersmith, renamed Hammersmith and Chiswick from I July 1880 and closed from 1 January 1917. There was another branch in the opposite direction from 13 June 1905 to Acton Town, a District Railway service that was withdrawn from 2 March 1959. Branch line from Acton TownConstruction= A short spur of the District Railway (DR) from station, 1,232 yards (1,126 metres) long, was authorised by the Metropolitan Railway Act of 1874.\\"Railway Magazine\\", December 1958 When first opened, the spur was used for goods trains from 15 May 1899 onwards. Passenger services were introduced on 13 June 1905 to provide an interchange with the North London Railway which ran services from north London to the DR's branch. It thus provided an easier interchange for Richmond for eastbound passengers than changing trains at further east. =Operations= The South Acton station on the District line of the London Underground was located adjacent to South Acton station on the North London Line on the north-west side of the tracks. Initially, the line had through passenger services to Hounslow Barracks (now ). However, the line was relatively little used and in 1932 the line was reduced to a single track, operated by a one-car shuttle service between Acton Town and South Acton. In 1933 the railway became part of the London Passenger Transport Board, becoming a branch line of the District line. Just south of the station before the Bollo Lane level crossing was located a major creamery and milk bottling plant for Express Dairies, which was served by milk trains from both the Great Western Railway and the Southern Railway.\\"Abandoned Stations - South Acton\\" In later years, the shuttle train was normally worked by a single car of London Underground G Stock, specially modified for one person operation and fitted with additional brakes. Given the (then highly unusual) driver-only operation, the branch line was equipped with a two wire emergency telephone system at window level, a feature normally found only in tunnels on the London Underground. =Closure= The South Acton to Acton Town shuttle last ran on Sat 28 February 1959 and the spur closed as from Mon 2 March 1959. Nothing now remains of the spur, except for a few bridgeheads and sections of the old trackbed, which indicate the route. Currently the rest of station of the same name continues to be well used; Branch line to Kew Bridge and Brentford A 2 km long branch exists to Old Kew Junction near Brentford station on the South Western Railway line from Waterloo which does not carry passenger services. There is also another spur from Kew East Jn to Kew Bridge railway station on the line towards Brentford. This comprised part of the North and South Western Junction Railway.

It took place at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, Scotland on Sunday, June 23, 1996. The 7‚Äì3 Scottish Claymores defeated the 7‚Äì3 Frankfurt Galaxy (the defending champions) 32‚Äì27 and, led by head coach Jim Criner, completed the league's first ever worst to first turnaround. Claymores wide receiver Yo Murphy was voted MVP for his 163 receiving yards and three touchdowns. 38,982 fans were in attendance that day, the highest in Claymores history and the largest crowd ever assembled for an American football game in Scotland. Background The Claymores won the regular season series against the Galaxy, 20‚Äì0 in Frankfurt and 20‚Äì17 in Edinburgh. Game summary The game got off to a fast start as Claymore safety George Coghill, on the opening kickoff, stripped the ball from Mario Bailey's arms. After the ball came out, running back Markus Thomas returned the ball 25 yards for a touchdown, allowing former Scotland rugby union player Gavin Hastings to kick the successful point after touchdown. However, the Galaxy would respond to the Claymores challenge, by having an 11-play, 80-yard drive that ended with Jay Kearney running 16 yards on a reverse play for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Galaxy quarterback Steve Pelluer would develop a 6-play, 30-yard drive that concluded with a two-yard touchdown pass to Mario Bailey. For the first time in the game, the Galaxy led the Claymores, but Scotland refused to enter halftime trailing. Claymore quarterback Jim Ballard would lead two successful drives, late in the half. First, a two-play, 39-yard would set up a six-yard pass to eventual MVP Yo Murphy. The point after touchdown failed. Then, a three-play, 15-yard drive would set the stage for a 16-yard pass to Murphy, but the two-point try failed, due to the Galaxy's pass rush. Still, the Claymores regained their lead, being ahead 19‚Äì14 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Claymores increased their lead by adding Paul McCallum's 46-yard field goal to their score. However, the Galaxy would respond with a four-play, 74-yard drive that ended with a 32-yard pass to Mario Bailey, but failed on the two-point conversion. The Claymores would respond with a 71-yard touchdown pass from Ballard to Murphy. The point after touchdown failed. In the fourth quarter, the Claymores would get four points on a 50-yard field goal by McCallum. With the Galaxy down 32‚Äì20, they needed points and they needed them fast. They would manage a seven-play, 63-yard drive that ended with a five-yard pass from Steve Pelluer to Mike Bellamy. After the Galaxy managed to get the ball back, they had less than a minute to get a touchdown and defend their title. Some quick passes helped Frankfurt get past midfield, but when the Galaxy reached a fourth and short situation, the mood throughout Murrayfield Stadium was tension. When the ball was snapped, the hand-off to Ingo Seibert was fumbled. Steve Pelluer managed to recover the ball and pick up the first down, but then, a flag was thrown. The referees stated that the fourth down rule was in effect. Since another player recovered the ball, the play was blown dead. It was that play and that rule that preserved the Claymores lead, giving them their 1996 World Bowl title.

A Romance is a historical romance novel by Sir Walter Scott, one of the Waverley novels, first published on 13 January 1821. Set in 1575 it leads up to the elaborate reception of Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle by the Earl of Leicester who is complicit in the murder of his wife Amy Robsart at Cumnor. Composition and sources In January 1820 Archibald Constable and John Ballantyne concluded an agreement to act as joint publishers of Kenilworth, but Scott had still to complete The Monastery and write its sequel The Abbot which kept him occupied until August, so that Kenilworth had to wait until September. Writing then progressed steadily, and the new novel was completed on 27 December.Walter Scott, Kenilworth: A Romance ed. J. H. Alexander (Edinburgh, 1993), 396‚Äì97. Scott was deeply acquainted with the literature and historical documents of the Elizabethan period, partly because of his editorial labours. In 1808 he produced Memoirs of Robert Cary, Earl of Monmouth ‚Ä¶ and Fragmenta Regalia ‚Ä¶ by Sir Robert Naunton, which were to stand him in good stead for his portrayal of Queen Elizabeth in the novel, and in 1810 he revised Robert Dodsley's The Ancient British Drama which contributed much to the linguistic texture of the novel. For the public activities at Kenilworth he used two documents reprinted in The Progresses and Public Processions ‚Ä¶ of Queen Elizabeth by John Nichols (1788): A Letter by Robert Langham or Laneham and The Princely Pleasures at the Courte at Kenelwoorth by George Gascoigne. For Amy Robsart and Cumnor he relied on Antiquities of Berkshire by Elias Ashmole which in turn drew on the anonymous and hostile Secret Memoirs of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester or Leicester's Commonwealth.Ibid., 473‚Äì74. Editions Kenilworth was published in three volumes by Constable and Ballantyne in Edinburgh on 13 January 1821,Edinburgh Evening Courant, 13 January 1821. and by Hurst, Robinson, and Co. in London on the 20th. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The print run was 10,000, with a further 2000 in a second edition which followed two months later, and the price was one and a half guineas (¬£1 11s 6d or ¬£1.57¬Ω). It is unlikely that Scott was involved with the novel again until April and May 1830, when he revised the text and provided an introduction and notes for the 'Magnum' edition in which it appeared as Volumes 22 and 23 in March and April 1831.For a description of the early editions see Ibid., 398‚Äì99, 408‚Äì15. The standard modern edition, by J. H. Alexander, was published in 1993 as Volume 11 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels: it is based on the first edition with emendations mainly from the manuscript; the Magnum material is included in Volume 25b. Plot introduction Kenilworth is set in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, and centers on the secret marriage of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and Amy Robsart, daughter of Sir Hugh Robsart. Amy passionately loves her husband, and the Earl loves her in return, but he is driven by ambition. He is courting the Queen's favour, and only by keeping his marriage to Amy secret can he hope to rise to the height of power that he desires. At the end of the book, the Queen discovers the truth, to the shame of the Earl. The disclosure has come too late, for Amy has been murdered by the Earl's even more ambitious steward, Varney. Plot summary Giles Gosling, the innkeeper, had just welcomed his mischievous nephew Michael Lambourne on his return from Flanders. He invited the Cornishman, Tressilian, and other guests to drink with them. Lambourne made a wager he would obtain an introduction to a certain young lady under the steward Foster's charge at Cumnor Place, seat of the Earl of Leicester, and the Cornish stranger begged permission to accompany him. On arriving there Tressilian found that this lady was his former lady-love, Amy. He would have carried her back to her home, but she refused; and as he was leaving he quarrelled with Richard Varney, the earl's squire, and might have taken his life had not Lambourne intervened. Amy was soothed in her seclusion by costly presents from the earl, and during his next visit she pleaded that she might inform her father of their marriage, but he was afraid of Elizabeth's resentment. Kenilworth Castle's 16th-century gatehouse, built by Robert Dudley Warned by his host against the squire, and having confided to him how Amy had been entrapped, Tressilian left Cumnor by night, and, after several adventures by the way, reached the residence of Sir Hugh Robsart, Amy's father, to assist him in laying his daughter's case before the queen. Returning to London, Tressilian's servant, Wayland Smith, cured the Earl of Sussex of a dangerous illness. On hearing about this from Walter Raleigh, Elizabeth at once set out to visit Leicester's rival, and it was in this way that Tressilian's petition, in Amy's behalf, was handed to her. The queen was agitated to learn of this secret marriage. Varney was accordingly summoned to the royal presence, but he boldly declared that Amy was his wife, and Leicester was restored to the queen's favour. Tressilian's servant then gained access to the secret countess Amy as a pedlar, and, having hinted that Elizabeth would shortly marry the earl, sold her a cure for the heartache, warning her attendant Janet at the same time that there might be an attempt to poison her mistress. Meanwhile, Leicester was preparing to entertain the queen at Kenilworth, where she had commanded that Amy should be introduced to her, and Varney was, accordingly, despatched with a letter begging the countess to appear at the revels pretending to be Varney's bride. Having indignantly refused to do so, and having recovered from the effects of a cordial which had been prepared for her by the astrologer Alasco, she escaped, with the help of her maid, from Cumnor, and started for Kenilworth, escorted by Wayland Smith. Travelling thither as brother and sister, they joined a party of mummers, and then, to avoid the crowd of people thronging the principal approaches, proceeded by circuitous by-paths to the castle. Having, with Dickie Sludge's help, passed into the courtyard, they were shown into a room, where Amy was waiting while her attendant carried a note to the earl, when she was startled by the entrance of Tressilian, whom she entreated not to interfere until after the expiration of twenty-four hours. On entering the park, Elizabeth was received by her favourite attended by a numerous cavalcade bearing waxen torches, and a variety of entertainments followed. During the evening she enquired for Varney's wife, and was told she was too ill to be present. Tressilian offered to lose his head if within twenty-four hours he did not prove the statement to be false. Nevertheless, the ostensible bridegroom was knighted by the queen. The Elizabethan Gardens at Kenilworth Receiving no reply to her note, which Wayland had lost, Amy found her way the next morning to a grotto in the gardens, where she was discovered by Elizabeth, who had just told her host that \\"she must be the wife and mother of England alone.\\" Falling on her knees the countess besought protection against Varney, who she declared was not her husband, and added that the Earl of Leicester knew all. The earl was instantly summoned to the royal presence, and would have been committed to the Tower, had not Amy recalled her words, when she was consigned to Lord Hunsdon's care as bereft of her reason, Varney coming forward and pretending that she had just escaped from a special treatment for her madness. Leicester insisted on an interview with her, when she implored him to confess their marriage to Elizabeth, and then, with a broken heart, told him that she would not long darken his brighter prospects. Varney, however, succeeded in persuading him that Amy had acted in connivance with Tressilian, and in obtaining medical sanction for her custody as mentally disordered, asking only for the earl's signet-ring as his authority. The next day a duel between Tressilian and the earl was interrupted by Dickie, who produced the countess's note, and, convinced of her innocence, Leicester confessed that she was his wife. With the queen's permission he at once deputed his rival and Sir Walter Raleigh to proceed to Cumnor, whither he had already despatched Lambourne, to stay his squire's further proceedings. Varney, however, had shot the messenger on receiving his instructions, and had caused Amy to be conducted by Foster to an apartment reached by a long flight of stairs and a narrow wooden bridge. The following evening the tread of a horse was heard in the courtyard, and a whistle like the earl's signal, upon which she rushed from the room, and the instant she stepped on the bridge, it parted in the middle, and she fell to her death. Her murderer poisoned himself, and the skeleton of his accomplice was found, many years afterwards, in a cell where he secreted his money. The news of the countess's fate put an end to the revels at Kenilworth: Leicester retired for a time from Court, and Sir Hugh Robsart, who died very soon after his daughter, settled his estate on Tressilian. Leicester pressed for an impartial inquiry. Though the jury found that Amy's death was an accident (concluding that Lady Dudley, staying alone \\"in a certain chamber\\", had fallen down the adjoining stairs, sustaining two head injuries and breaking her neck), it was widely suspected that Leicester had arranged his wife's death to be able to marry the Queen.

Reception Kenilworth was well received by most of the reviewers.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews of Kenilworth see William S. Ward, Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1821‚Äí1826: A Bibliography (New York and London, 1977), 173‚Äí74. For an earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 240‚Äí42. With few exceptions they welcomed the unusual tightness of the structure, the vividness of the Court scenes, and the portrayal of Elizabeth, though there were a few objections to the highlighting of her foibles. The chapter depicting the afflictions of Sir Hugh Robsart was very generally found affecting, and the very different presentation of Lambourne was also judged striking. Amy attracted a wide range of comments, the majority of them praising her moral stature. It was noted that the historical Leicester was partly sanitised by the transfer of some of his worst features to the villain Varney. Several reviewers praised the unusually dramatic qualities of the new novel, and there was much appreciation of the pervasive contrast of public splendour and private agony. Explanation of the novel's title The title refers to Dudley's Kenilworth Castle in Kenilworth, Warwickshire. The novel opens at Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). Themes Kenilworth is a novel of selfishness versus selflessness and ambition versus love. Amy and the Earl both struggle internally with selfishness and love, while Varney and Tressilian each typify the extremes of the two qualities. Perhaps the finest point of this work is its characterization. The Earl is shown as an ambition-driven man who will stoop to deceit and almost anything else in order to attain his goals, but with one saving grace‚Äîhe loves Amy, and in the end gives up his pride and ambition to confess their marriage. Amy Robsart is a pretty, spoiled child whose tragic circumstances teach her maturity and determination, although such lessons come too late to save her. Tressilian is the serious, steadfast lover of Amy, and continues to try to save her from herself throughout the book and finally dies of a broken heart. Varney is the chief villain of the work. His greed and ambition know no bounds. It is he that pushes the Earl beyond what he would normally do to secure power, and it is he that finally murders Amy Robsart. Departures from historical fact Much of the novel gives a fair depiction of the Elizabethan court, although the circumstances of Amy Robsart's death from a fall are greatly altered, and also many other events are a product of Scott's imagination. The death of Amy Robsart had been the subject of speculation for more than 200 years, and in 1810 Cumnor Place was pulled down, it was said, solely in order to lay her ghost to rest. The reception at Kenilworth which provides the backdrop to the novel took place in 1575, and frequent references to how many years have passed since other events such as the Queen's accession, the deposition of Mary, Queen of Scots, and so forth, indicate that the novel is set in that year‚Äîbut Amy Robsart died on 8 September 1560. Leicester's first marriage was not, in fact, a closely guarded secret; it was his secret marriage in September 1578 to Lettice Knollys (with whom he had flirted in 1565) that caused the Queen's anger in 1579. William Shakespeare, who was not even born until 1564, is mentioned in Chapter 17 as an adult and as being known at court, rubbing shoulders with Edmund Spenser, whose first major work The Shepheardes Calender was not published until 1579; and in Chapter 16, Queen Elizabeth even quotes from Troilus and Cressida, which was written around 1602. The character of Sir Nicolas Blount seems to be broadly based on Sir Christopher Blount, who was in fact an official in the household of the Earl of Essex. Adaptations In 1822, the young Victor Hugo agreed with the elder Alexandre Soumet to write a five-act drama based on Scott's novel. Soumet had outlined the plot and was to write the last two acts, while Hugo was to write the first three. When they confronted the written materials, they agreed that their principles were incompatible. Each completed his own drama. Soumet's earnest Emilia was produced at the Od√©on in 1823 with Mademoiselle Mars, while Hugo's Amy Robsart, freely mingling tragedy with comedy, was staged in 1828. Gaetano Donizetti's 1829 opera Elisabetta al castello di Kenilworth is loosely based on Scott's novel. Years later, in 1859, the Mar√≠a¬¥s author and poet, Jorge Isaacs made an adaptation to theater: Amy Robsart, however, at that time his work did not receive the importance it deserved; nowadays the writer's playwright facet is recognized. In 1957 the novel was adapted into a six-part BBC television series Kenilworth, now believed to be lost. Allusions to the novel Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs Entrance into Kenilworth of 1838 references Amy in this novel from the start (Lonely sits the lovely lady, Lonely in the tower). Landon was a devotee of Scott's novels. In Balzac's 1841 novel Ursule Mirou√´t the villainous Goupil warns the fledgling barrister Desire against marrying for a whim, threatening to crush the woman \\"like Varney crushes Amy Robsart in Kenilworth\\". In keeping with the city's many Walter Scott references, Rose Street in Edinburgh has a pub called The Kenilworth, which was established in 1904. Portland, Oregon, has a neighborhood called Creston-Kenilworth, the latter part of which is named for the novel. The Elvetham Hotel near to the village of Hartley Wintney in Hampshire, England, is one of the former homes of the barons Calthorpe. The bar in the hotel has an ornate ceiling decorated with characters from the Kenilworth novel. Translation The novel was translated into French by Jacques-Th√©odore Parisot (1783-1840) under the title Le ch√¢teau de Kenilworth.

She is a former member of the Brazilian band Os Mutantes and is a popular figure in Brazilian entertainment, where she is also known for being an animal rights activist and a vegan. She has sold more than 60 million albums worldwide. Her autobiography Rita Lee: Uma Autobiografia was the best-selling non-fiction book of 2017 in Brazil.

Rita studied classical piano with the renowned pianist Magdalena Tagliaferro. In place of the traditional adolescent debut ball, she asked to receive a drum set. She was educated in a French-language school and became fluent in Spanish, French, and Italian, as well as her native Portuguese and the English that her parents spoke at home. She went to college, with the popular actress Regina Duarte as one of her classmates, but she soon left to pursue her musical career.  Career  In 1966, Lee formed the band Os Mutantes with Arnaldo Baptista and S√©rgio Dias. The band released five albums between 1968 and 1972. In that time, Lee had also released her first two solo works, although these records were produced with fellow members of Os Mutantes. When the band reformed in 2006, she refused to join, calling the reunion an attempt to \\"earn cash to pay for geriatry\\". Lee formed a band with two other friends, excelling at vocals so much that they backed stars such as Tony Campelo, Jet Blacks, Demetrius, and Prini Lopez, when they met the brothers Arnaldo and S√©rgio Dias Baptista. Adopting the name O'Seis (a pun with \\"the six\\" and the Brazilian caipira way of saying \\"you all\\"), they recorded the single \\"O Suicida,\\" which was never released. When the rest of the band left for college, only three of them remained. Picking the name Os Mutantes, they backed Nana Caymmi on her then-husband's composition \\"Bom Dia\\" (Gilberto Gil). When Gil met them, he immediately knew Os Mutantes were on the same track as the Baianos, and the band worked extensively with the members of the Tropicalia collective over the next two years, becoming an integral part of the movement. Gil Invited them to accompany him at TV Record's 1967 III Festival da MPB, where they performed Gil's \\"Domingo no Parque\\" with the addition of Rog√©rio Duprat conducting an orchestra with his revolutionary arrangements. Gil's friend Caetano Veloso also performed with a rock group (S√£o Paulo band Beat Boys), and although the novelty of electric instruments and the general irreverence of the mixing of western pop and strange orchestral sounds irritated some in the festival audience, both performances ultimately won approval, with Gil coming second and Veloso taking fourth place. Within a year, however, the nascent Tropicalia movement would face strident opposition from both the military junta that ruled Brazil at the time, and from Brazil's student left, who regarded the Tropicalistas' dalliance with Western pop as a sell-out. Soon after, Os Mutantes recorded their single \\"O Rel√≥gio\\". National Archives of Brazil. In 1968, Os Mutantes performed on the album/manifesto Tropic√°lia ou Panis et Circensis (Philips), with Nara Le√£o, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, and Tom Z√©. This was also when they recorded their first LP, Os Mutantes, and they also backed Gilerto Gil on his second self-titled solo album . In September 1968, Os Mutantes backed Caetano Veloso during his two notorious performances in TV Globo's Third International Song Festival in Rio. The ensemble was met with howls of disapproval from leftist students in the audience at their first- round appearance, due to their challenging psychedelic music, as well as Veloso's lurid costume, and his sexually provocative stage moves. The confrontation climaxed in the second round of the competition on September 15, when Veloso performed his newly-written psychedelic protest song \\"√â Proibido Proibir\\" (\\"It is Forbidden to Forbid\\"). Left-wing students in the audience (who were strongly opposed to the Tropicalismo experiment) loudly abused, booed and jeered the performers, and pelted the stage with fruit, vegetables and paper balls. A large group in audience showed their disapproval by turning their backs to the stage, prompting Lee and her bandmates to turn their backs on the audience, and Veloso responded angrily to the heckling, haranguing the students at length for their conservatism.Victoria Langland, \\"Il est Interdit d'Interdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil\\", Estudios Interdisciplinarios de Am√©rica Latina y el Caribe, Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006) The group also performed their \\"Caminhante Noturno\\", which won seventh place. In the same year, they participated at the IV FMPB with their \\"Dom Quixote\\" and, by Lee and Tom Z√©, \\"2001\\". At the end of this year, they performed with the Baianos at the Sucata nightclub, Rio, and recorded their second album, also self-titled. In 1969, following the arrests of Gil and Veloso, Os Mutantes went to Europe, playing at Cannes, France, at the MIDEM, and in Lisbon, Portugal. Then, they returned to Brazil and presented the show O Planeta dos Mutantes, the first multi-media experiment in Brazil. With bassist Liminha and drummer Dinho, they participated in the V FIC with \\"Ando Meio Desligado\\" (Arnaldo and Rita). In 1970, Lee recorded her solo album, Build Up, produced by Arnaldo Baptista. Soon after, they had a stint at the Olympia in Paris. In that period, during their somewhat frequent tours in Europe, they recorded an LP that was never fully released, Tecnicolor, with the exception of some tracks included on 1971's Jardim El√©trico. The LP, A Divina Com√©dia ou Ando Meio Desligado, is from that year and Jardim El√©trico (Polydor) from the next. In 1972, Lee recorded another solo album backed by Os Mutantes, Hoje √â o Primeiro Dia do Resto da Sua Vida (Philips). After releasing the Mutantes e Seus Cometas no Pa√≠s do Baurets, Lee was ejected from the group by Arnaldo. Following a period of depression, during which she became locked up in her home, she decided to abandon her career, but, at the same time, she was writing the material that would make her famous as a solo artist. Going solo In late 1972, Lee left Os Mutantes and started a solo career. She was initially part of a female duo with singer L√∫cia Turnbull called Cilibrinas do √âden, and after a short time the duo met Lisergia, a band that would eventually become Lee's backing band with the name of Tutti Frutti. In 1974, the band recorded their first album Atr√°s do Porto Tem Uma Cidade (There is a City Behind the Harbor) that brought some great songs such as \\"Mam√£e Natureza\\", \\"Menino Bonito\\", and \\"P√© de Meia\\". In 1975, she recorded the album Fruto Proibido with the band. The album was praised by critics, sold more than 200,000 copies ‚Äì a record to Brazilian rock and roll singers at the time ‚Äì and Lee was given the title \\"Queen of Rock\\". In 2007, the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone magazine ranked this album as the 16th-best Brazilian album of all time in its \\"100 Best List\\". The producer was Andy Mills, producer of Alice Cooper and then Lee's boyfriend. In the late 1970s, Lee started a partnership with her husband, Roberto de Carvalho, and many subsequent albums were credited to the duo Lee/Carvalho. In the late 1970s, Lee was mentioned in the Caetano Veloso song, \\"Sampa\\". In 1976, pregnant for the first time, she was arrested for possession of marijuana and condemned to one year of house imprisonment, when she composed with Paulo Coelho the single \\"Arrombou a Festa\\", which sold 200,000 copies. She continued to perform, under special judge permits. Soon after, she recorded the single \\"Doce de Pimenta\\" with singer Elis Regina, and recorded and toured with Gilberto Gil in the show/album Refestan√ßa. In 1978, she released Babil√¥nia, her fourth and last album with the band Tutti Frutti. The last work came after disagreements between members of the band. The guitarist Luis Carlini left the band, taking the name Tutti Frutti with him. Rita and the rest of the band finished the tour under the name Rita Lee & C√£es e Gatos. Lee started recording with her husband, Roberto de Carvalho. The couple wrote hits such as \\"Mania de Voc√™\\" (1979), \\"Lan√ßa Perfume\\" (1980), \\"Sa√∫de\\" (1981), \\"Flagra\\" (1982), and \\"On The Rocks\\" (1983). Personal life Lee was married to Mutante Arnaldo Baptista from 1971 to 1972. In 1976, MPB singer Ney Matogrosso introduced her to guitarist Roberto de Carvalho, whom she married, and they had three children: Beto Lee, Jo√£o Lee, and Ant√¥nio. She has been married to Carvalho ever since and refers to him as her \\"boyfriend\\". Other activities Aside from her musical career, Lee had a humor program called Radio Amador on Brazilian radio for nine months in 1986. That same year, Lee wrote three children's books and appeared in Brazilian movies and TV shows.

The De Medicina is a primary source on diet, pharmacy, surgery and related fields, and it is one of the best sources concerning medical knowledge in the Roman world. The lost portions of his encyclopedia likely included volumes on agriculture, law, rhetoric, and military arts. He made contributions to the classification of human skin disorders in dermatology, such as Myrmecia, and his name is often occurring in medical terms about the skin, e.g., kerion celsi and area celsi. Life Nothing is known about the life of Celsus. Even his praenomen is uncertain; he has been called both Aurelius and Aulus, with the latter being more plausible.\\"Traditionally he is called Aurelius, but Aurelius is a clan name, not a praenomen; hence Aulus, a common first name among the Cornelii, has been suggested and has manuscript support.\\" - The McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world biography, (1973), page 448. Some incidental expressions in his De Medicina suggest that he lived under the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius; which is confirmed by his reference to the Greek physician Themison as being recently in his old age.Celsus, De Medicina, praef.; iii. 4 It is not known with any certainty where he lived. He has been identified as the possible dedicator of a gravestone in Rome, but it has also been supposed that he lived in Narbonese Gaul, because he refers to a species of vine (marcum) which, according to Pliny,Pliny, Hist. Nat. xiv. 32 was native to that region.\\"He has been identified with the dedicator of a gravestone from Rome. On the other hand, the rare name Cornelius Celsus occurs on a few inscriptions from Tarraco and Narbo. ... In the part of his work on agriculture, Celsus mentioned (Col. 3. 2. 25) a species of vine (marcum) which, according to Pliny (Nat. 14. 32), is native to Narbonese Gaul.\\" - D. R. Langslow, (2000), Medical Latin in the Roman Empire, page 43. Oxford University Press It is doubtful whether he practised medicine himself, and although Celsus seems to describe and recommend his own medical observations sanctioned by experience, Quintilian says that his volumes included all sorts of literary matters, and even agriculture and military tactics.Quintilian, xii. 11 Works De medicina Of the numerous volumes of his encyclopedia, only one remains intact, his celebrated treatise On Medicine (De Medicina). \\"The work‚Äôs encyclopedic arrangement follows the tripartite division of medicine at the time as established by Hippocrates and Asclepiades ‚Äî diet, pharmacology, and surgery.\\" It is divided into eight books. * Book 1 - The History of Medicine (includes references to eighty medical authors, some of whom are known only through this book) * Book 2 - General Pathology * Book 3 - Specific Diseases * Book 4 - Parts of the Body * Book 5 and 6 - Pharmacology * Book 7 - Surgery * Book 8 - Orthopedics In the \\"Prooemium\\" or introduction to De Medicina there is an early discussion of the relevance of theory to medical practice and the pros and cons of both animal experimentation and human experimentation. Celsus discusses, for example, the case of Herophilos and Erasistratos, who he asserts practised vivisection.Preface, 23-6. In the treatment of disease, Celsus' principal method was to observe and watch over the operations of Nature, and to regulate rather than oppose them, conceiving that fever consisted essentially in an effort of the body to throw off some morbid cause, and that, if not unduly interfered with, the process would terminate in a state of health. On occasions, however, he boldly recommends the use of the scalpel; his rules for blood letting and purgatives are laid down with detail and precision;Celsus, De Medicina, ii. 10, etc. and many of the rules he prescribes were not very different from those still in use at the beginning of the 19th century. His work contains detailed descriptions of the symptoms and different varieties of fever,Celsus, De Medicina, iii. 3, etc. and he is credited with recording the cardinal signs of inflammation known as \\"Celsus tetrad of inflammation\\": calor (warmth), dolor (pain), tumor (swelling) and rubor (redness and hyperaemia). He goes into great detail regarding the preparation of numerous ancient medicinal remedies including the preparation of opioids. In addition, he describes many 1st century Roman surgical procedures which included removal of a cataract, treatment for bladder stones, and the setting of fractures. During the twentieth century, many historians claimed that Celsus believed that the crystalline lens is in the exact center of the eye. In fact, Celsus made no specific statement about the position of the crystalline lens, and his Graeco-Roman contemporaries did understand that the lens is located to the front. Hippocrates used the Greek word Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ∫ŒØŒΩŒøœÇ - kark√≠nos, meaning crab or crayfish, to refer to malignant tumors as carcinomas. It was Celsus who translated the Greek term into the Latin cancer, also meaning crab. The first printed edition of Celsus' work was published in 1478. His style has been much admired as being equal in purity and elegance to that of the best writers of the Augustan age. Also, Celsus wrote a technical work on agriculture, on which Columella partly based his De Re Rustica. * In hoc volvmine haec continentvr Avrelii Cornelii Celsi medicinae libri VIII : qvam emendatissimi, Graecis etiam omnibvs dictionibvs restitvtis.

It is located on the city's South Side. History The name \\"Grand Crossing\\" comes from an 1853 right-of-way feud between the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and the Illinois Central Railroad that led to a frog war and a crash that killed 18 people. The crash was the result of Roswell B. Mason (later to serve as mayor of Chicago) illegally constructing railroad tracks, on behalf of the Illinois Central, across another railroad company's tracks. Due to the lack of safety at the crossing, trains made complete stops here and therefore industry developed around the area to cater to the railroad workers of mostly Irish, Scottish, English, and German descent. The area was further developed by Paul Cornell throughout the 1870s. Grade separation did not occur at the rail crossing until 1912. Demographics By the 1930s, the railroad workers residing in the neighborhood were joined by Swedes and Italians. Throughout the next two decades, African Americans began moving into the neighborhood from the overcrowded Black Belt and that's when Grand Crossing's White residents began to move out of the neighborhood. During the 1950s, the Black population of the neighborhood rose from 6% to 86%. Today, the neighborhood is 97% Black. Transportation The CTA's Red Line provides 24/7 service to Grand Crossing at the 69th Street and 79th Street stations. Additionally, the Metra Electric line provides commuter rail service at the 75th Street station at the intersection of East 75th Street and South Chicago Avenue; the railroad crossing that gave the neighborhood its name. Politics The Greater Grand Crossing community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, the Greater Grand Crossing cast 12,647 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 233 votes for Donald Trump (96.68% to 1.78%). Despite Clinton's 94.60% margin of victory, it was only her 16th best finish in the City of Chicago. In the 2012 presidential election, Greater Grand Crossing cast 15,408 votes for Barack Obama and cast 89 votes for Mitt Romney (99.23% to 0.57%).

He was the first to undertake the creation of the national epic of Iran, the Shahnameh, but came to an abrupt end in 977 after only completing 1,000 verses. His work was continued by his contemporary Ferdowsi, who would later become celebrated as the most influential figure in Persian literature.  Name  Daqiqi's personal name was Muhammad ibn Ahmad, whilst his patronymic was Abu Mansur, thus his full name being Abu Man·π£≈´r Mu·∏•ammad ibn Ahmad Daqƒ´qƒ´. He is generally known in sources by his pen-name, Daqiqi (meaning \\"accurate\\" in Arabic and Persian).  Background and religion  Daqiqi was born around some time after 932. Like many other Iranian grandees and scholarly of the early Middle Ages, Daqiqi was most likely born into a family of Iranian landowners (dehqans), or at least was descended from such a class. During this period there was a large amount of growth in literature, mostly in poetry. It was under the Iranian Samanid Empire that Persian literature appeared in Transoxania and was formally recognized. The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of Fars, the homeland of the Persians. Daqiqi's place of birth is disputed‚àíthe cities of Bukhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Marv, and Tus have been described as his birthplace; the latter seems more likely. His religion belief is disputed amongst scholars. Although he had a Muslim name, this \\"was not in itself proof of any religious beliefs, since numerous prominent Iranian scholars and officials converted to Islam during the early Islamic period in order to maintain their means of livelihood but practised Zoroastrianism in secret\\" (Tafazzoli). His birthplace, Tus, was at that time a predominantly Shi'ite city, and during Abu Mansur Muhammad's governorship had become the hub of Iranian nationalism. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, it is thus likely that Daqiqi, possibly like fellow poet and Tus-native Ferdowsi, was an adherent of Shia Islam. Many Shi'ite Muslims were proud of their ancient Iranian heritage, which resulted in them being described as Qarmatians and Shu'ubis and classified as MƒÅj≈´s (Zoroastrians) and Zindƒ´q (Manicheans). Some quotations from Daqiqi's poetic verses, however, show a strong veneration towards Zoroastrianism, which have led to many scholars such as N√∂ldeke and Shahbazi favor a Zoroastrian origin for Daqiqi. In one of Daqiqi's verses, he applauds the Zoroastrian religion as one of the four things most important to him;  Biography  17th-century Shahnameh illustration of Biderafsh killing Zarir, the brother of Gushtasp. Daqiqi began his career at the court of the Muhtajid ruler Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad in Chaghaniyan, and was later invited to the Samanid court by the Samanid ruler (amir) Mansur I (). Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the Shahnameh (\\"The Book of Kings\\"), a long epic poem based on the history of the Iranians. He was, however reportedly murdered by his slave in 977. Only a small part of Shahnameh had been completed, which was about the conflict between Gushtasp and Arjasp. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made Ferdowsi continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud (). However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it was by the Samanids. Daqiqi's small part, which included around 1,000 verses, was maintained in the Shahnameh; his technique is more old-fashioned compared to that of Ferdowsi, and also \\"dry and devoid of the similes and images that are to be found in Ferdowsi's poetry\\" (Khaleghi- Motlagh). This was mentioned in the Shahnameh by Ferdowsi, who although admired him, also criticized his poetic style, and considered it inappropriate for the national epic of Iran.

The fight made boxing history in many ways. While this pair of world champions fought three times, their first fight is the one that writers and fans usually remember with fondness. Background In boxing, there are certain types of \\"rivalries\\" that fans get excited about most of the time. When a Puerto Rican fighter faces a Mexican, for example, in a major title fight, most of the time the fight itself is considered a big boxing event. The same can be said about Mexicans fighting against a fellow Mexican for a world title. The Mexican versus Mexican-American rivalries also fall among boxing fans' favorite rivalries. A good example is the sustained rivalry between Bobby Chacon, from California, and Rafael Lim√≥n, from Mexico. A more recent example is Oscar De La Hoya against Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez. When Michael Carbajal, from Phoenix, Arizona, became a professional boxer in 1989, Humberto Gonz√°lez, from Mexico, was already a seasoned professional. Carbajal's promoter, Bob Arum, told Ring magazine that Carbajal would be the first junior flyweight to earn one million dollars for one fight. Carbajal won the IBF world junior flyweight title in 1990, joining WBC world champion Gonzalez as co-champions of that division. After Carbajal won the title, fan excitement about a possible match between the two began to grow. But Gonzalez lost his title to Rolando Pascua on October of that year, and he had to regain it from Melchor Cob Castro, who took over as champion after beating Pascua. Meanwhile, Carbajal had begun a streak of defenses against a number of important challengers. When Gonzalez regained his WBC belt, he also retained it against a long list of challengers. The fact that both boxers were seemingly on what boxing fans call a \\"clash course\\" brought another element of excitement whenever fans would talk about a future match between Carbajal and Gonzalez. Knowing that this was a well talked about match-up, promoter Arum began to work towards making it happen. In what could perhaps be called a rare case of boxing unity, both the WBC and IBF agreed to have their champions fight a unification bout. The date set was March 17, 1993. The fight received much media attention both in the United States and in Latin America, with Carbajal and Gonzalez being featured on the cover of multiple magazines on the months preceding the bout. Arum proved half prophetic in his guess that Carbajal would be the first junior flyweight to earn one million dollars in a fight: Both Carbajal and Gonzalez got a guarantee of one million dollars, after they paid their due fees, and Carbajal-Gonzalez I became the first time in history that a fight fought at the Flyweight division or a smaller one garnered one boxer that amount of money. It was also the first time that a junior flyweight world title bout was shown as the main event of a Pay Per View fight card. The fight The fight took place on the date (March 17, 1993) that it was set for (unlike many major fights that sometimes get postponed). Carbajal and Gonzalez fought that night in front of an estimated crowd of 6,400 in the Hilton Center at the Las Vegas Hilton. Among the people watching the fight in person were many Hollywood stars, which is also very rare for a junior flyweight bout. Gonzalez set the pace in round one with his jab and cross, stunning Carbajal as he (Gonzalez) counter-punched. Gonzalez proved very slick for Carbajal, who had trouble finding his rival, but nonetheless, fought back furiously. In round two, a Gonzalez right to Carbajal's chin sent the Arizona native down for a short count. Carbajal started landing stronger punches by round three. But Gonzalez's ability to counter-punch Carbajal's attack seemed to be the factor that would dictate the fight. By the end of the round, Carbajal sported a cut over one of his eyes. Gonzalez and Carbajal kept trading punches in round four, but it was apparent that Gonzalez was faring better than Carbajal. Carbajal's corner team had begun to grow impatient by this point. Gonzalez almost had Carbajal knocked out in round five. Ironically, that round might have been the round that turned the fight in Carbajal's favor. A straight right landed flush on Carbajal's chin, and Carbajal struggled to stay inside the fight's ring as he fell, grabbing to the rope with his left hand. Gonzalez was now eager to finish the fight by knockout, and Carbajal realized he was behind on points so badly, that he had to try to win by knockout as well. Fighting with desperation, Carbajal finally got to Gonzalez, who by now was tired, in round six, connecting strong punches to the head and causing swelling around one of Gonzalez's eyes. Still, Carbajal felt that he had to do more to win the bout. As both fighters were looking for a defining, knockout punch they traded punches in the seventh round, as they say in boxing, \\"toe to toe\\". During one of these exchanges, Carbajal unexpectedly landed a right uppercut to Gonzalez's chin, leaving him paralyzed on his feet. As Gonzalez did not move from his stand for the next couple of seconds, Carbajal took advantage and moved to the right, adding a left to Gonzalez's face that would make Gonzalez fall to the canvas on his back. The referee counted Gonzalez out, giving Carbajal the fight by a seventh-round knockout. The aftermath Michael Carbajal defended the IBF and WBC world junior flyweight titles twice before his second fight with Gonzalez. The pair fought three fights, with Gonzalez winning the next two, one in Los Angeles and another one in Mexico City, but both of Gonzalez's wins came by controversial decision and the two sequels to fight one between Carbajal and Gonzalez were considered to be boring fights by fans and writers alike. Gonzalez retired after losing the IBF and WBC belts to Saman Sorjaturong in 1995. Carbajal, for his part, kept on winning, and losing, world titles until his last fight, when he knocked out Jorge Arce in eleven rounds at Tijuana in 1999 to regain the WBO version of the world junior flyweight championship. Michael Carbajal and Humberto Gonz√°lez were both elected as members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a city in East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia in a region traditionally owned by the Tatungalung clan of the Gunaikurnai people.https://gunaikurnai.org/who-are-the-gunaikurnai/ The estimated population of Bairnsdale urban area was 15,411 at June 2018. Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. The city is a major regional centre of eastern Victoria along with Traralgon and Sale and the commercial centre for the East Gippsland region and the seat of local government for the Shire of East Gippsland. Bairnsdale was first proclaimed a shire on 16 July 1868 and it was proclaimed as a city on 14 July 1990. Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room. The origin of the city's name is uncertain. It was possibly Bernisdale, with \\"Bernis-dale\\" originating from \\"Bjorn's dale, or glen\\", which indicates the Viking origins of the Skye Village. Legend has it that Macleod was so impressed by the large number of children on the run, the children of his stockmen, that he called it Bairns-dale, or \\"valley of the children\\". In 1876 the Bairnsdale Shire, which went on to become one of the largest in Victoria in the 1880s, was led out of administrative chaos by former shire auditor and shipping agent Herman Bredt. He had also acted as a mine manager for the nearby Sons of Freedom mine. German born Bredt was the father of Bertha Bredt who married the famous Australia poet and writer Henry Lawson. Prior to this she had worked at the Bairnsdale Hospital. In this period the Main Street was fashioned but was unsealed thereby causing extensive problems of dust in the summer and mud in the winter. Asphalting didn't take place until 1883. Nicholson Street was formed in 1877 and MacLeod Street followed in 1879. The Gunaikurnai people are the traditional owners of Gippsland. There are approximately 3,000 Gunaikurnai people, and the territory includes the coastal and inland areas to the southern slopes of the Victorian Alps. Gunaikurnai people are made up of five major clans, of which the Tatungalung are owners of the region in which Bairnsdale is located. Geography Bairnsdale is sited on a bend of the Mitchell River, with the river flowing from the west along the northern edge of the town, before turning south to flow along the eastern edge, although suburbs are now found across the river to both north and east, e.g. Wy Yung, Eastwood and Lucknow. =Mitchell River= The Mitchell River flows into Lake King and Jones Bay at Eagle Point Bluff. The Mitchell, Tambo and Nicholson rivers deliver a combined discharge of 1.1 gigalitres per year into the lakes system. The Strategic Management Plan quotes that about 100,000 tonnes of suspended solids (excluding bottom sediments) are estimated to enter the Gippsland Lakes each year from the catchments of the Mitchell, Tambo and Nicholson rivers alone. Sediment loads from the western catchments (discharging to Lake Wellington) deliver two to three times the nutrient and sediment loads than from the eastern catchments (Mitchell, Nicholson and Tambo rivers). Comparison of aerial photographs spanning 1935 to 1997 demonstrate that the vast majority of shorelines are eroding at an average of less than 10 cm per year. The lower reaches of the Latrobe River, Thomson River and Mitchell River flow into the Gippsland Lakes and have extensive floodplains in which there are large wetlands, often separated by natural levees from the main river channels. The Mitchell river flats were always prone to flooding and 1891 bore witness to the flood that was only second in extent to the great floods of 1870. The biggest floods recorded were in 1893‚Äì94 with them being 76 mm higher than the 1870 water levels. All floods caused the township great suffering with loss of life, infrastructure and crops. The flooding that occurred in the 1893‚Äì94 was notable for the gallantry of Patrick Piggott and George Brooks who both worked to rescue people. However, on their last trip their boat tipped as they moored it and both men were swept into the river and drowned. A witness remonstrated that; \\"‚Ä¶to the very last, they fought bravely for their lives against fearful odds\\". Both men are remembered upon a marble tablet installed at the Mechanics' Hall (The Bairnsdale Library). The Mitchell Delta is represented as a type-L under the Ramsar wetland type classification framework, which means that it is a permanent inland delta. The Mitchell Delta is a classic form of digitate delta (from Latin digitƒÅtus, having finger or toes) and is located near the western shoreline of Lake King at Eagle Point Bluff, extending into the lake as silt jetties formed by alluvial deposition of sediment. The Mitchell Delta represents one of the finest examples of this type of landform in the world and is a site deemed of international geomorphological significance and is one of the finest examples of a classic digitate delta in the world. A colony of nationally Threatened Grey-headed flying foxes (pteropus poliocephalus) roosts along the river in poplars adjacent to Riverine St. The native bats pollinate over 100 species of native trees and plants and have declined across their range by over 95% since 1900. Their long-distance movement of floral genetic material reduces the in-breeding of trees and help produce strong timber. With a high mortality rate and low reproduction considerable efforts are being devoted to the bats' conservation. =Wetlands= Macleod Morass and Jones Bay Wildlife Reserves cover an area of 557 hectares and 123 hectares, respectively. The Reserves lie immediately south of Bairnsdale at the head of Lake King and on either side of the Mitchell River. According to tradition, the Tatungoloong clan of the Gunai/Kurnai peoples were the custodians of land and waters and used the aquatic and terrestrial habitats of the area as sources of food and the surrounding open forest for shelter. Macleod Morass formed with and was eventually isolated from Lake King and Jones Bay with the development of the Mitchell River silt jetties. The marginal bluff marks the former shoreline position of Lake King and the relict gravel beaches and spits were formed by wave action. The area contains geological features and sites of state geological and geomorphological significance. The extensive 'backswamp' forming Macleod Morass, the escarpment ('marginal bluff') along its western boundary, and relict gravel beaches and spits (e.g. Brownlow's Point) are important features providing evidence of once higher sea levels in Bass Strait. Macleod Morass was originally classified as a 'deep freshwater marsh' but currently only approximately 30% of the morass is still representative of the original classification. Water inflows to the morass are dominated by catchment run-off from Cobblers Creek and several smaller intermittent streams, urban stormwater from McGees Gully, and direct rainfall. Major floods in the Mitchell River result in complete inundation of Macleod Morass and serve to 'flush' the entire wetland system. Since 1939, wastewater that has been treated to varying levels has been discharged to Macleod Morass, resulting in elevated nutrient levels, reductions in water quality and changes in the distribution and abundance of vegetation. Macleod Morass Wildlife Reserve was first reserved on 16 August 1961 under the Land Act 1958 (Vic.). Jones Bay Wildlife Reserve was first reserved on 7 April 1961 for the Preservation of Wildlife under the Land Act. Macleod Morass and Jones Bay Wildlife Reserves occur within the Gippsland Lakes Ramsar Site, listed under the Convention on Wetlands or The Ramsar Convention. The reserves contain a range of threatened vegetation types that provide habitat for a diverse array of wildlife including 23 threatened fauna species. Over 100 bird species, including 53 waterbird species, have been recorded within the vicinity. Eight migratory bird species found in the reserves are listed under the international Japan‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement 1974 (JAMBA), China‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement 1987 (CAMBA) and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Macleod Morass is an important breeding site for Australian white ibis (Threskiornis moluccus), straw-necked ibis (Threskiornis spinicollis) and black-winged stilt (Himantopus himantopus). Management strategies are in place to protect known sites of significant fauna and colonial breeding waterbirds from unnecessary disturbance, particularly the white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), green and golden bell frog, warty bell frog, black-winged stilt, Australian white ibis and the straw-necked ibis. A diverse range of 141 fauna species has been identified near the reserves, including 23 fauna species listed as threatened in Victoria and three nationally vulnerable.  Climate  Bairnsdale experiences a temperate climate with warm summers and cool, damp winters. The highest recorded temperature in the town was 46.2 degrees Celsius on 7 February 2009, during the early 2009 Australian summer heatwave. The lowest, ‚àí5.4 degrees, was recorded on 2 July 2017. Landmarks Victorian Heritage Database and the National Trust Register. On 19 October 2013 the church celebrated its 100th anniversary Some of the earlier buildings in the town are perhaps a memorial to William J. Yates, who was a prominent architect, builder and monumental mason. He built the school, the old Shire Hall (1860), the Wesleyan Church and parsonage (1876), St. John's Church, the old Bairnsdale Hospital (corner of McKean and Ross Streets) and the Mechanic's Hall. = Roman Catholic Church = One of the most notable landmarks of Bairnsdale is the St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Main Street known for its distinctively tall tower. Construction of St Mary's Church was commenced in 1913, replacing an earlier brick church which had been built thirty years earlier in 1883. Murals cover the walls and ceiling of St Mary's in Bairnsdale depicting saints, the trinity and scenes of hell, purgatory, heaven and the crucifixion. Every year the church receives up to 80,000 visitors from all over Australia and the world. The murals were painted by out of work Italian artist Francesco Floreani during the Great Depression and remain a fascination to this day. St Mary's Roman Catholic Church was well established when a new church building was opened on 29 April 1883. The Reverend Fr Patrick O'Donohue was priest from 1883 to 1888. Early in the 1880s a school was opened and developed quickly so that extensions to the building were added in 1888. There were about 120 pupils in 1890. Fr Cremin oversaw the congregation from 1909 and in this period plans were drawn up to erect a magnificent brick church at an estimated ¬£10,000. The architects were A. A. Fritsch and Harry French. Work started in August 1913 with the a stone being laid by Bishop Phelan of Sale on 19 October. The new church with its tower, described by a witness as, \\"a free treatment of Romanesque style, built of brick with a slate roof\\". Bairnsdale experienced growth in church numbers in the 1880s, many of them frequently recording packed congregations, particularly on special occasions. St Johns Church of England often had congregations of over 200 at the morning and evening services. The congregations of that church were headed by the Reverend E. W. S. Hartmann who later lost his life crossing the flooded Mitchell River. He was succeeded by W. G. Hindley, under whom a new brick church was built (still on the corner of Francis and Service Streets) and opened by Bishop Moorhouse on 24 June 1884. The former Bairnsdale Hospital buildings designed by Harry Gibbs, the two- storey central block, the single-storey pavilions on each side and the Contagious Diseases Ward to the south, are architecturally significant as an outstanding and largely intact example of nineteenth century hospital design. = Gardens = Bairnsdale's centre gardens stretch from the Mitchell River to the western edge of town, a distance of about . The main garden section runs for over through the central commercial district and features beds of flowering annuals and perennials, numerous mature deciduous and evergreen trees, war memorials and a restored historic band rotunda. The rotunda was constructed in 1910 and restored to its present condition in 1993. In 1943 the erection of a monument at the eastern end of the gardens to the district centenary led to that section being called the Centenary Garden. The Country Women's Association (CWA) Younger set took over the beautification of the Centenary Garden in 1947 and planted a tree there in May of that year to commemorate the 21st birthday of Princess Elizabeth. Extensive tree planting with Australian native trees was carried out in the post-war years, providing a colourful display, particularly in spring and early summer. From 1964 under the care of the town's head gardeners, E. A. Cottrell and C. T. Harrison, the gardens had been extended westward with the planting of hardy trees, in particular desert ash and flowering gum. By 1959 the highway had been extended to the foot of the hospital hill, and tree planting and lawns had provided two kilometres of gardens on the centre reserves. Garden beds were extended westward to the West End Store in 1975 with the help of people employed under the Whitlam Government Regional Employment Development Scheme (REDS) for the unemployed. In 1969 a wishing well that was carved by Bruce Duffy of the Technical School and financed by the Rotary was erected in the Centre Gardens adjacent to the Coles supermarket. In 1984 a plaque was added to commemorate Victoria's 150th anniversary. To commemorate those locals who did not return from the Boer War in 1899, a monument was unveiled in the Main Street Gardens on 12 June 1903 in the presence of Lord and Lady Forrest, a number of returned men, school cadets and a large crowd of citizens. = Cemetery = Entrance to the Bairnsdale Cemetery on the corner of Forge Creek Road The Bairnsdale cemetery is now located off Forge Creek road opposite the race course. Its original location was situated at punt flat, now the site of the Mitchell Gardens Holiday Park beside the river. A plaque in acknowledgement of the site is located at the south-east corner of the Caravan Park. As a result of the major flooding in 1870 the site experienced erosion and reports were made that remains were washed downstream. Peter Moroney, Shire Secretary at the time, instructed William Jefferson to retrieve the remains and they were re-interred at the present cemetery. As far back as the 1920s the cemetery was frequently criticised for its untidy appearance. It was proposed around this time that the cemetery be removed from the overseer of the council and transferred to the care of the different denominations. This was not adopted. In 1990 control of the cemetery was transferred to a community based trust. The lawn section of the cemetery was commenced in 1969. Initially, wooden pegs were used to indicate grave numbers; later, cloverleaf-shaped cast-iron pegs were used. In 1946 a memorial garden was established for Bairnsdale's war dead. The Imperial War Graves Commission took over this section in 1946 and the area was attractively laid out with a fine gate and cypress hedge, well kept lawns and white headstones, with a central memorial Cross of Sacrifice to the memory of the RAAF personnel who died in the Bairnsdale district during the war. Sir Dallas Brooks unveiled the Cross on a visit to the town on 7 September 1950. The lawn section was planned in 1964 and completed in 1970. Frederick Jones was the earliest of the squatters in the Bairnsdale Shire. Jones had previously been a school teacher in Castlereagh Street, Sydney. In the early 1840s Jones joined one of the early pastoralists in the Gippsland area, William Odell Raymond, at Omeo‚Äîhe was traveling south from the Wellington area where he owned land on the Macquarie River across the border in New South Wales. They arrived at the Mitchell River crossing on 20 June 1842. Once in the region Jones decided to take up the area of Lucknow. He named it such, in contrast to the other settlers Frederick Taylor and John M. Loughnan who had taken up Lindenow‚Äîthe reason being that Jones had left Sydney a poor man and he felt auspicious about his new life and hence felt his 'luck' was on the ascendancy. In 1848 John Archer who was a retired sea-captain was appointed manager of Lucknow Station. Jones traveled back to New South Wales to visit his run on the Murrumbidgee River. Archer had been a master on the Letitia which operated between Sydney and Hobart and, later, traded cattle between Port Albert and Hobart. In 1845 Archer married a young girl named Eliza and brought her to Gippsland, settling at Lucknow in 1847. Eliza died in childbirth and her grave can still be seen to this day by the roadside in Crooke Street, East Bairnsdale. The inscription on the headstone reads 'Sown in weakness, to be raised in power'. The monument is not on the original burial position, several house blocks to the west, and has been moved down the street as houses have been built. It is thought that this headstone is the only remaining evidence that there was indeed a cemetery in this location in the 1800s. InfrastructureEducation= Educational facilities in Bairnsdale include two high schools. The government funded Bairnsdale Secondary College, with approximately 1,600 students, was formed in 1993 as a merger of two separate high schools: the Bairnsdale Technical School (earlier known as the Bairnsdale School of Mines and Industries) and Bairnsdale High School. Nagle College, which has about 1,000 students, was founded in 1958 by the Presentation Sisters holds to a Catholic tradition. It later adopted the Salesian traditions of St John Bosco, with the arrival of the Salesian Society to Bairnsdale in 1990. The city also has a number of primary schools including the well established and historical Bairnsdale Primary School, Bairnsdale West Primary School, Lucknow Primary School located in Eastwood and East Gippsland Specialist School which has accommodates students from prep to year 12. As well there are many kindergartens but limited tertiary education facilities mainly consisting of the East Gippsland Institute of TAFE and Federation Training. =Transport= Bairnsdale railway station Bairnsdale established a reputation as a marketing and trading centre for the large rural area of East Gippsland and this has been helped by the development of excellent road systems, a good railway service and to some extent steamer and air services. The 1880s were seen as the 'Golden Age' for steamer traffic on the rivers and Bairnsdale was seen as one of the major colonial ports. The brick Bairnsdale railway station opened in 1890 with other platforms and railway infrastructure being completed at the same time. The contractor R. Kreokel won the contract for the work to be carried out for the amount of ‚Ç§2,322. Shipping services from Bairnsdale to metropolitan areas linked with the railway so local primary producers could send their goods off to the markets in the major centre of Melbourne. As a consequence of the more frequent use of rail and the advent of refrigerated carts in 1890 which allowed dairy farmers and fishermen to appropriately transport their produce, the last coach service between Sale and Bairnsdale ran in 1889. In World War II rail services were reduced with only three trains per week direct to Bairnsdale but services were restored in 1948. In 1952 diesel trains were first used on the line and the daily train from Melbourne to Bairnsdale was named The Gippslander. Victorian Railways established the Bairnsdale station as a regional freight centre in 1977. The contemporary rail transport system is still facilitated by the major railway station in Bairnsdale railway station which is the terminus of the Bairnsdale railway line. V/Line provides rail services. Performance figures for 2014 for services to Bairnsdale (long-distance service) ran at 98.9% and 86.7% for reliability and punctuality, respectively. In comparison with figures from May to December 2013, the average reliability and punctuality are both down just 0.5%. Currently, Bairnsdale Cabs provides a local taxi service around the city. Bus service is facilitated by Gillicks Bus Lines, Dysons (V/Line contractor) and Goodalls Bus Lines as well as a number of others in Bairnsdale and surrounding areas. One of the major recreational transport infrastructure systems in the city is the East Gippsland Rail Trail which begins in at the entrance to East Bairnsdale adjacent to Howitt Park. The track consists of asphalt that extends to Nicholson where it then becomes a track made from hard base gravel that forms a solid surface. Almost in length, the multi-use trail permits running, walking, cycling and horse-riding as it follows the alignment of the former railway line to Orbost. The Bairnsdale section of the track is relatively straight, long and flat and takes users over two small bridges and crosses Phillips Lane and Morrisson Road before it intersects with the Princes Highway, which was given that name in 1920 when the Country Roads Board assumed control of the whole length of highway between Melbourne and Eden. =Aerodrome= Bairnsdale Airport is situated on a large land area of 280 hectares owned wholly by East Gippsland Shire Council. It was established as part of the war effort in the 1940s. In this time, the aerodrome which is located on Bengworden Road was used as an extension to the nearby East Sale R.A.A.F. Base and was home to 3,000 men. The main purpose of the facility was for reconnaissance missions and navigational training over Bass Strait and the Tasman Sea. Earlier back in 1929 a suitable site for the aerodrome was required, with the racecourse suggested but deemed unsuitable. In 1935 submissions were made to the Civil Aviation Department to select a site. In mid-1939 the boundaries of the Aerodrome were established and buildings were erected. By 1947 the buildings were sold, dismantled and transported to the Woomera Project in South Australia. The Commonwealth Government gave high priority to developing new coastal airbases at Mallacoota and Bairnsdale to assist in protecting shipping lanes in Bass Strait. The base became fully operational in May 1942 with the arrival of the No. 7 Squadron operating Hudson Aircraft on shipping convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols. At the same time the new Bristol Beaufort bombers were moved to Bairnsdale in June 1942. The No. 1 operation Training Unit trained 631 pupils, flew 38,875 hours and had aircraft in the air around the clock. There were 53 crashes with aircraft being lost at sea and 71 airmen killed and others injured. In total there were 1,997 officers and airmen and 117 WAAAF members with an additional 285 trainees. Adding to this were 12 Hudson crews and ground staff dispatched during December 1942 to assist in New Guinea by dropping supplies to ground troops in the Buna area. Two Hudsons were lost with four men killed in action and a further four being seriously injured. Before the end of the war 87 lives were lost at Bairnsdale owing to crashes or missing aircraft. In total there were 100 aircraft based at Bairnsdale. The aircraft included 50 Beauforts, 12 Lockheed Hudsons, 25 Airspeed Oxfords, 12 Fairey Battles and one Tiger Moth. In March 1950 Australian National Airlines launched a regular service from Bairnsdale to Melbourne with a Douglas DC-3, a 24-passenger plane. A succession of companies including Ansett-ANA, Commuter Airlines, Jetair Services and Business Jets tried to establish a similar service but without any long-term success. In 1966 and 1967 Helicopters were used to transport pipeline-laying-barge and offshore oil platform workers, mainly employees of the American-owned McDermott's, into Bass Strait. Since then the West Sale Airport has been used extensively for this purpose. Currently the aerodrome's facilities support a number of commercial aviation enterprises, including aerial firefighting, corporate charter, aircraft support services such as fleet maintenance, and medical services such as air ambulance and courier services. =Water supply= Bairnsdale's Water Tower has been out of commission since the late 1980s and now serves as an icon of the Bairnsdale skyline Plans were put forward in 1884 for the town's water supply and tanks were erected in Main Street from which residents could draw water. Later, John H. Grainger who designed the new Princes Bridge in Melbourne delivered plans to build a reservoir west of the township and for this to be connected to a pumping-plant and an elevated tank in the town itself. Contracts totaling ¬£6,132 were made for Potter and Roberts to build the reservoir. The pipes were laid by soon after with John Jefferson appointed the engineer of the works. By 1890 reticulation of the town was ready to take place. An upgrade to the station in 1906 included installation of a new, larger cylindrical, concrete tank with a capacity of , designed by (Sir) John Monash's Reinforced Concrete and Monier Pipe Construction Company. At the time this tank was a pioneering example in the state of reinforced concrete construction for water tank construction. In 1935 a dosing shed was added to the tank for chemical treatment of the water supply. A new cylindrical, concrete pump house was also added in 1906, which initially housed a steam-driven pump but from 1926 housed a pair of newly invented electrically-powered X-pumps. In order to supply a more consistent water pressure a reinforced concrete water tower was also built in Main Street in 1926‚Äì27. Measuring high with a capacity of the structure was constructed by civil engineer Svend Haunstrup. In 1935 another pump house with five electric booster pumps was built on the upper level. A workshop was added in the 1950s. The pumping station continued to operate until the 1980s, when the new Woodglen storage basin at Glenaladale was complete. Today the tower sits as a well-recognised icon of the Bairnsdale skyline. In 1955, costing ¬£32,000 works commenced on new mains and pumping plants to extend reticulation to sections of West Bairnsdale and in 1958 work began on reconditioning the existing mains and pipes using cement lining. With the increasing demand for water during the 1960s the Water Trust went ahead with plans to install a clarification plant and to set up a 90-megalitre basin at Wy Yung that was to be linked with the already existing system. Plans were also slated for an additional storage basin to be built on the Mitchell River at Glenaladale. The basin at Wy Yung was opened on 8 November 1972. In 1983 the government sought to reduce the number of local water trusts and sewerage authorities. The Mitchell Water Board replaced the Bairnsdale Water and Sewerage Trusts, the Paynesville Water Trust, the Lindenow Water Trust and the Bairnsdale Shire Sewerage Trust. To ensure long-term drinking water supplies, a major additional drinking water storage and water treatment plant located northwest of Bairnsdale at Woodglen entered service in mid-2010, providing a significant boost to long-term water security for the region. This plant is capable of processing up to 20 megalitres of water a day and utilises a Dissolved Air Floatation/Filtration process, more commonly known as a DAFF water treatment process. At 600 metres long, 300 metres wide and ten metres deep the facility is designed to hold 715 megalitres of water, equivalent to 715 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This facility supplements Woodglen's original 850-megalitre storage. Twenty-four thousand people are reliant on the Mitchell River water supply system, from Lindenow through to Nowa Nowa, including the communities of Bairnsdale, Paynesville and Lakes Entrance.

Strang and his adherents to prove that he was the designated successor to Joseph Smith as the prophet and president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It formed part of a four-tiered argument for succession, being that according to various passages in Doctrine and Covenants, a prophet successor had to be A) appointed by Joseph Smith, B) ordained by angels, C) receive revelations as Smith did and D) translate ancient records certified by witnesses. Sent from Nauvoo, Illinois on June 19, 1844, to Strang in Burlington, Wisconsin, this letter was highly influential at gathering support for Strang's claim to succession until his death. Following Strang's murder in 1856, the letter passed through various hands until acquired by Yale University, where it currently forms a part of its Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. James J. Strang 1856 daguerreotype of James Strang, taken on Beaver Island, Lake Michigan, by J. Atkyn, itinerant photographer and later one of Strang's assassins. James J. Strang was from Scipio, New York and received \\"no education after the age of 15.\\" Having educated himself, he became a lawyer by the age of 22. He was a latecomer to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, converting and being baptized and ordained by Joseph and Hyrum Smith in early 1844, both of whom were murdered by an anti-Mormon mob on June 27 of that year. Upon Smith's death, a number of individuals came forward to lead his church, including Strang. As a recent convert, Strang did not yet possess the name recognition among rank-and-file Mormons that was enjoyed by Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon, two contenders who claimed leadership on the basis of rank - Young as president of the Quorum of the Twelve and Rigdon as sole survivor of the First Presidency. Hence, Strang, as an unknown new convert, faced an uphill battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to Smith's prophetic mantle. Strang also claimed to have received an angelic appointment at the very moment of Smith's death,Strang (1848), pp. 5‚Äì6. and, like Smith, claimed the ability to translate ancient documents on metal plates into modern English. Strang's position of maintaining the same church structure as Smith, led by a prophet, seer, revelator and translator with the fruits of prophecy - prophetic revelations and translations - continued to win him converts until his assassination twelve years later. His success prompted Brigham Young, who was steadily losing membership maintaining that he should lead as president of the Twelve Apostles and that there would be no successor, to change his position and have himself appointed President of his faction. The letter Unlike Rigdon and Young, Strang offered physical proof of his prophetic calling. Strang possessed a letter purportedly authored by Smith and mailed one week before his murder, prophesying of his impending demise and naming Strang as his successor. The wording of the letter is somewhat ambiguous. Critics who accept the letter as genuinely from Smith interpreted it as appointing Strang solely to the presidency of the newly created Voree Stake,Strang's own son, Charles Strang, took this position. See Smith, Heman, History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, vol. 3, chapter 2, pp. 52‚Äì53. while Strangites insist that it appoints him to Smith's prophetic office and receiver of revelations for the whole church. =Events as related in \\"The Diamond\\"= In his tract \\"The Diamond,\\" Strang relates this version of events: > This letter was received at Burlington by regular course of mail, coming > through the distributing office at Chicago, and bears the Nauvoo postmark of > June 19, the day following its date. It arrived at Burlington July 9, and > was immediately taken from the office by C. P. Barnes, Esq., a distinguished > lawyer at that place, who, in consequence of the rumors of persecution and > civil war against the Mormons, and a general anxiety to hear the latest > news, immediately carried it to Mr. Strang, with the request to be informed > of any news of public interest which it might contain. It therefore became > public the same evening.Strang, James J. The Diamond: Being the Law of > Prophetic Succession. Voree, Wis.: 1848, pp. 3-4. Emma Smith's testimony corroborates Smith's writing a letter to Strang: \\"Mrs. Emma Smith recollects well of her husband receiving a letter from Mr. Strang, and holding a council on the subject, and names Hyrum Smith, Willard Richards and John P. Greene as present at that council, and also that a letter was sent to Mr. Strang in answer, but of the import of the answer she was not informed.\\"Strang (1848), p. 4. She and the entire Smith family were persuaded by it enough to declare their support for Strang. Next, Strang accused the members of the Quorum of the Twelve of conspiring together to suppress evidence of his appointment to the prophetic office-and even the possibility of murder: > Immediately after the martyrdom of Joseph, John Taylor, Willard Richards and > William W. Phelps took a kind of temporary direction of the affairs of the > church, instructing the saints to wait patiently the hand of the Lord; > assuring them that he had not left them without a shepherd, and that all > things would be made known in due season. To every question of the saints, > Who is the prophet? replies were made, in substance, that the saints would > know in due season, but that nothing could be done until the Twelve got > home, because the appointment of a prophet and the directions for salvation > of the church from the perils they were in, was contained in sealed packages > directed to them. Orson Hyde and others of the Twelve, who were then in the > east, stated in public congregations in New York, Philadelphia and other > cities, that Willard Richards had written to them that the appointment of a > prophet was left with him, under seal, to be opened on the return of the > Twelve. This assertion was so often made that the whole church were daily > expecting to hear a new prophet proclaimed. On the 8th day of August, 1844, > when Sidney Rigdon endeavored to obtain authority to lead the church, John > P. Green, marshal of the city of Nauvoo, told them, \\"They need not trouble > themselves about it, for Joseph had appointed one James J. Strang, who lived > up north, to stand in his stead.\\" The sudden death of John P. Green > immediately after this declaration (under very extraordinary circumstances) > left Willard Richards [the cousin of Brigham Young] and John Taylor sole > repositors of all documents on this subject, except this letter. After the return of the Twelve, the alleged promise of the \\"sealed packages\\" naming Smith's successor appears to have been dropped. =Corroboration in Postal Records and Alleged Cover-up= When Strang's supporters attempted to prove that Smith had mailed the letter using postal records in Nauvoo, they found that the corresponding portion of the Nauvoo postal records were missing. However, the records remained intact in the Chicago and Burlington post offices, showing that the letter was indeed mailed from Smith to Strang.Strang, James. The Prophetic Controversy: A Letter from James J. Strang to Mrs. Corey. St. James, Beaver Island: 1854, pp. 29‚Äì31. Although Brigham Young quickly denounced the letter as a \\"wicked forgery,\\"Letter of Brigham Young, 24 January 1846. Original at Beinecke Library, Yale University. Retrieved on 2007-11-04. this did not stop two of the apostles in the Quorum of Twelve from supporting Strang, together with William Marks (Nauvoo Stake president), members of Smith's family (including his sisters, mother and widow) and many others. Questions of authenticity Page three of Strang's \\"Letter of Appointment,\\" with possible signature of Joseph Smith. Experts agree that the postmark on the letter is genuine.Jensen, Robin Scott (2005). Gleaning the Harvest: Strangite Missionary Work 1846‚Äì50. Provo, Utah, BYU Press, p. 6, n. 17. Retrieved on 2007-10-30. Strang's opponents at first challenged falsely that the stamp was the wrong color and subsequently challenged the authenticity of the stamp by pointing to a tiny dot on the postmark, just before the \\"J\\" in \\"June\\"-one that they claimed should not have been there. Strang, however, produced several letters mailed from Nauvoo on June 19, all of which had the same flaw in the stamp, thus confirming its authenticity.Strang, James J. (1854), Delivery of the Letter of 0Appointment. The Prophetic Controversy: A Letter from James Strang to Mrs. Corey , St. James, pp. 32‚Äì34. Other critics assert that the outer sheet containing the postmark and address is of different stock (needs citation) than the first two pages, however this is disputed. This theory infers that Strang disposed of the first two pages, retaining the last page with the post mark and composed his own partial letter containing the appointment. Analysis indicates that the handwriting on all three pages is the same. Vague references to Strang's appointment appear throughout the letter. On page one: \\"The faith which thou hast in the Shepherd, the stone of Israel [Joseph Smith], hath been repaid to thee a thousandfold, and thou shalt be like unto him; but the flock shall find rest with thee, and God shall reveal to thee his will concerning them.\\" Page two continues: \\"[H]e [Strang] had faith in thee [Smith], the Shepherd and Stone of Israel, and to him shall the gathering of the people be.\\" Page three: \\"Thy [Strang] duty is made plain . ... [I]f evil befall me [Smith], thou shalt lead the flock to pleasant pastures.\\" Modern analysts are divided on the authenticity of Smith's signature. The difficulty stems from the fact that Joseph Smith not only had scribes write his letters, but also sign his name for him. Therefore it is difficult to be certain of which signatures and handwriting are actually his, even of known authentic works. Still, some authors have ventured to dispute the signature on this basis.Quinn, D. Michael (1994). The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power. Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books, p. 210. See also Eberstadt, Charles, \\"A Letter That Founded a Kingdom,\\" Autograph Collectors' Journal (October, 1950): 3‚Äì8. Given that Smith had scribes sign his name on official documents regularly, even if the signature was penned by someone other than Smith, it would not of itself cast doubt on the letter's authenticity. In 1956, Donna West Falk obtained photostats of three letters that the Illinois Historical Library assert are definitely Joseph Smith's and presented them with a photostat of the Letter of Appointment to the handwriting firm of Tyrell and Doud for analysis, a firm recognized as authorities in court rooms across the country. The letters studied were: A) A four page letter addressed to Horace H. Hodgekiss, Esg., dated Nauvoo Oct. 25, 1841 (exhibit A), B) A four page letter addressed to Smith Tuttle, Esq., dated Nauvoo, Ill. Oct. 9, 1841 (exhibit B), C) A three page letter addressed to H. R. Hodgekiss, Esq., dated Nauvoo, May 13, 1842 (exhibit C) and D) The Letter of Appointment addressed to James J. Strang, dated Nauvoo, Ill. June 18, 1844 (exhibit D). None of the three appear to match, consistent with Smith's use of scribes for official letters. If Emma Smith's recollections on the writing of the letter were accurate, Joseph, Hyrum, Willard Richards and John P. Greene were present and any of them could have written the letter and signed it. The above analysis would cast doubt on Richards as a handwriting match, however, Exhibit C (indicated as scribed by Richards) was written in long hand, while Exhibit D was written in print. Further authentication would require examples of printed hand writing samples from Hyrum Smith, John P. Green and Willard Richards. The \\"letter of appointment\\" is still accepted and defended by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite).

A branch to Epsom Downs was opened on 22 May 1865, followed by a line to Mitcham Junction on 1 October 1868. The final change to the station came when the branch to Wimbledon opened on 5 January 1930. Until the early 1980s, it was possible to catch a direct express train to the coast from Sutton to Bognor Regis, Chichester or Portsmouth. Since the mid-1980s, these express services have been routed via East Croydon in order to serve Gatwick Airport; passengers from Sutton for the south coast now have to change at Horsham, or alternatively travel to West Croydon station and walk, take the bus or use Croydon's Tramlink service to reach East Croydon station. Today, travel to London Victoria takes just over 25 minutes on the direct route via and . = Layout = The four platforms at Sutton station are numbered 1 to 4 from north to south. Platforms 1 and 2 are on the lines to Wimbledon, Epsom, Leatherhead, Dorking, and Horsham. Platforms 3 and 4 are on the Epsom Downs Line, which becomes single-track about south of the station. Platforms 1 and 3 are used by services from outer termini to Central London. Trains from Central London use platforms 2 and 4. Terminating trains which return to central London generally use platform 4. Platforms 1 and 2 can accommodate 12-coach trains, and were used by the express services to and Portsmouth Harbour until they were diverted in the early 1980s to serve Gatwick Airport. Nowadays all trains calling at Sutton are formed of ten coaches or fewer. At the London end of platform 1, there are the remains of a fifth platform, which was a bay for local services via Mitcham Junction. Two waiting rooms serve the station. One has its own cafe; the other has a Starbucks kiosk adjacent to it. An M&S; Food to Go shop sits adjacent to the concourse within the station building. Three lifts serve all platforms ‚Äì one each for platforms one, two/three and four. The installation of a side entrance serving the Quadrant was completed in summer 2014. = Wimbledon branch = Parliamentary approval for a line from Wimbledon to Sutton had been obtained by the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway (W&SR;) in 1910, but work had been delayed by the First World War. From the W&SR;'s inception, the District Railway (DR, now the District line) was a shareholder of the company and had rights to run trains over the line when built. In the 1920s, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL, precursor of London Underground) planned, through its ownership of the DR, to use part of the route for an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;, now the Northern line) to Sutton. The SR objected and an agreement was reached that enabled the C&SLR; to extend as far as Morden in exchange for the UERL giving up its rights over the W&SR; route. The SR subsequently built the line, one of the last to be built in the London area. In both the 1910 and 1920s proposals, the next station towards Wimbledon was to be Cheam on Cheam Road, but the SR dropped this station and replaced it with West Sutton station. The line opened on 5 January 1930 when full services on the line were extended from South Merton.  Services  Services at Sutton are operated by Southern and Thameslink using Class 377, 455 and 700 EMUs. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is: * 2 tph to London Victoria (semi-fast) * 2 tph to London Victoria via * 4 tph to London Victoria via * 2 tph to London Bridge via West Croydon * 2 tph to * 4 tph to (stopping) * 2 tph to of which 1 continues to * 4 tph to (2 of these run via Hackbridge and 2 run via Wimbledon)  Connections  London Buses routes 80, 164, 280, 470, S1, S3 and S4, night route N44 and non-TFL route 420 serve the station.  Future  A planned extension to the Tramlink light rail or a separate bus rapid transit (BRT) system called the Sutton Link will create a new tram or BRT/rail interchange in Sutton, offering services to South Wimbledon via St Helier.https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/trams/sutton-link/  References  External links  Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Sutton Category:Former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1847 Category:Thameslink railway stations Category:Railway stations served by Southern Category:Proposed London Underground stations Railway station Category:1847 establishments in England ","title":"Sutton railway station (London)"},{"id":"1638993","text":"BMW i8 Roadster butterfly door Butterfly doors are a type of car door sometimes seen on high-performance cars.

Biography He was born and lived most of his life in Herat, a city in western Afghanistan which was an important center of trade and the cultural and economic capital of the Timurid Empire. An orphan, he was raised by the prominent painter Mirak Naqqash, and was a prot√©g√© of Mir Ali Shir Nava'i. His major patrons in Herat were the Timurid sultan Husayn Bayqarah (ruled 1469‚Äì1506) and other amirs in his circle. After the fall of the Hamad, he was employed by Shah Ismail I Safavi in Tabriz, where, as director of the royal atelier, he had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid painting. Behzad died in 1535, and his tomb is located in Herat, in Saeede Mukhtar which is located in north of Herat city on the top of a hill. A statue of Behzad is placed in 2-Kamal Tomb. Career and style Behzad is the most famous of Persian miniature painters, though he is more accurately understood as the director of a workshop (or kitabkhƒÅna) producing manuscript illuminations in a style he conceived.Roxburgh, David J., ‚ÄúKamal al-Din Bihzad and Authorship in Persianate Painting,‚Äù Muqarnas, Vol. XVII, 2000, pp. 119-146.Lentz, Thomas, ‚ÄúChanging Worlds: Bihzad and the New Painting,‚Äù Persian Masters: Five Centuries of Painting, ed., Sheila R. Canby, Bombay, 1990, pp. 39‚Äì54.Lentz, Thomas, and Lowry, Glenn D., Timur and the Princely Vision, Los Angeles, 1989. Persian painting of the period frequently uses an arrangement of geometric architectural elements as the structural or compositional context in which the figures are arranged. Behzad is equally skilled with the organic areas of landscape, but where he uses the traditional geometric style Behzad stretches that compositional device in a couple ways. One is that he often uses open, unpatterned empty areas around which action moves. Also he pins his compositions to a mastery at moving the eye of the observer around the picture plane in a quirky organic flow. The gestures of figures and objects are not only uniquely natural, expressive and active, they are arranged to keep moving the eye throughout the picture plane. He uses value (dark-light contrast) more emphatically, and skillfully than other medieval miniaturists. Another quality common to his work is narrative playfulness: the almost hidden eye and partial face of Bahram as he peers out the blinds to watch the frolicking girls in the pool below, the upright goat that looks like a demon along the edge of the horizon in a story about an old woman confronting the sins of Sanjar, the amazing cosmopolitan variety of humans working on the wall in the sample image. This surprising individuality of character and narrative creativity are some qualities that distinguish Bezhad's works and that match their literary intent. Behzad also uses Sufi symbolism and symbolic colour to convey meaning. He introduced greater naturalism to Persian painting, particularly in the depiction of more individualised figures and the use of realistic gestures and expressions. Behzad's most famous works include \\"The Seduction of Yusuf\\" from Sa'di's Bustan of 1488, and paintings from the British Library's Nizami manuscript of 1494-95 - particularly scenes from Layla and Majnun and the Haft Paykar (see accompanying image). The attribution of specific paintings to Behzad himself is often problematic (and, many academics would now argue, unimportant), but the majority of works commonly attributed to him date from 1488 to 1495.  Bihzad in literature  Bihzad is mentioned throughout Orhan Pamuk's novel, My Name is Red, in which a workshop of Ottoman miniaturists regards him as one of the greatest Persian miniaturists.

It was developed by David Mumford in 1965, using ideas from the paper in classical invariant theory. Geometric invariant theory studies an action of a group G on an algebraic variety (or scheme) X and provides techniques for forming the 'quotient' of X by G as a scheme with reasonable properties. One motivation was to construct moduli spaces in algebraic geometry as quotients of schemes parametrizing marked objects. In the 1970s and 1980s the theory developed interactions with symplectic geometry and equivariant topology, and was used to construct moduli spaces of objects in differential geometry, such as instantons and monopoles.  Background  Invariant theory is concerned with a group action of a group G on an algebraic variety (or a scheme) X. Classical invariant theory addresses the situation when X = V is a vector space and G is either a finite group, or one of the classical Lie groups that acts linearly on V. This action induces a linear action of G on the space of polynomial functions R(V) on V by the formula : g\\\\cdot f(v)=f(g^{-1}v), \\\\quad g\\\\in G, v\\\\in V. The polynomial invariants of the G-action on V are those polynomial functions f on V which are fixed under the 'change of variables' due to the action of the group, so that g¬∑f = f for all g in G. They form a commutative algebra A = R(V)G, and this algebra is interpreted as the algebra of functions on the 'invariant theory quotient' V //G because any one of these functions gives the same value for all points that are equivalent (that is, f(v)=f(gv) for all ). In the language of modern algebraic geometry, : V/\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/G=\\\\operatorname{Spec} A=\\\\operatorname{Spec} R(V)^G. Several difficulties emerge from this description. The first one, successfully tackled by Hilbert in the case of a general linear group, is to prove that the algebra A is finitely generated. This is necessary if one wanted the quotient to be an affine algebraic variety. Whether a similar fact holds for arbitrary groups G was the subject of Hilbert's fourteenth problem, and Nagata demonstrated that the answer was negative in general. On the other hand, in the course of development of representation theory in the first half of the twentieth century, a large class of groups for which the answer is positive was identified; these are called reductive groups and include all finite groups and all classical groups. The finite generation of the algebra A is but the first step towards the complete description of A, and progress in resolving this more delicate question was rather modest. The invariants had classically been described only in a restricted range of situations, and the complexity of this description beyond the first few cases held out little hope for full understanding of the algebras of invariants in general. Furthermore, it may happen that any polynomial invariant f takes the same value on a given pair of points u and v in V, yet these points are in different orbits of the G-action. A simple example is provided by the multiplicative group C* of non- zero complex numbers that acts on an n-dimensional complex vector space Cn by scalar multiplication. In this case, every polynomial invariant is a constant, but there are many different orbits of the action. The zero vector forms an orbit by itself, and the non-zero multiples of any non-zero vector form an orbit, so that non-zero orbits are parametrized by the points of the complex projective space CPn‚àí1. If this happens (different orbits having the same function values), one says that \\"invariants do not separate the orbits\\", and the algebra A reflects the topological quotient space X /G rather imperfectly. Indeed, the latter space, with the quotient topology, is frequently non- separated (non-Hausdorff). (This is the case in our example ‚Äì the null orbit is not open because any neighborhood of the null vector contains points in all other orbits, so in the quotient topology any neighborhood of the null orbit contains all other orbits.) In 1893 Hilbert formulated and proved a criterion for determining those orbits which are not separated from the zero orbit by invariant polynomials. Rather remarkably, unlike his earlier work in invariant theory, which led to the rapid development of abstract algebra, this result of Hilbert remained little known and little used for the next 70 years. Much of the development of invariant theory in the first half of the twentieth century concerned explicit computations with invariants, and at any rate, followed the logic of algebra rather than geometry.  Mumford's book  Geometric invariant theory was founded and developed by Mumford in a monograph, first published in 1965, that applied ideas of nineteenth century invariant theory, including some results of Hilbert, to modern algebraic geometry questions. (The book was greatly expanded in two later editions, with extra appendices by Fogarty and Mumford, and a chapter on symplectic quotients by Kirwan.) The book uses both scheme theory and computational techniques available in examples. The abstract setting used is that of a group action on a scheme X. The simple-minded idea of an orbit space :G\\\\X, i.e. the quotient space of X by the group action, runs into difficulties in algebraic geometry, for reasons that are explicable in abstract terms. There is in fact no general reason why equivalence relations should interact well with the (rather rigid) regular functions (polynomial functions), which are at the heart of algebraic geometry. The functions on the orbit space G\\\\X that should be considered are those on X that are invariant under the action of G. The direct approach can be made, by means of the function field of a variety (i.e. rational functions): take the G-invariant rational functions on it, as the function field of the quotient variety. Unfortunately this -- the point of view of birational geometry -- can only give a first approximation to the answer. As Mumford put it in the Preface to the book: :The problem is, within the set of all models of the resulting birational class, there is one model whose geometric points classify the set of orbits in some action, or the set of algebraic objects in some moduli problem. In Chapter 5 he isolates further the specific technical problem addressed, in a moduli problem of quite classical type -- classify the big 'set' of all algebraic varieties subject only to being non-singular (and a requisite condition on polarization). The moduli are supposed to describe the parameter space. For example, for algebraic curves it has been known from the time of Riemann that there should be connected components of dimensions :0, 1, 3, 6, 9, ‚Ä¶ according to the genus g =0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ‚Ä¶, and the moduli are functions on each component. In the coarse moduli problem Mumford considers the obstructions to be: *non-separated topology on the moduli space (i.e. not enough parameters in good standing) *infinitely many irreducible components (which isn't avoidable, but local finiteness may hold) *failure of components to be representable as schemes, although respectable topologically. It is the third point that motivated the whole theory. As Mumford puts it, if the first two difficulties are resolved :[the third question] becomes essentially equivalent to the question of whether an orbit space of some locally closed subset of the Hilbert or Chow schemes by the projective group exists. To deal with this he introduced a notion (in fact three) of stability. This enabled him to open up the previously treacherous area -- much had been written, in particular by Francesco Severi, but the methods of the literature had limitations. The birational point of view can afford to be careless about subsets of codimension 1. To have a moduli space as a scheme is on one side a question about characterising schemes as representable functors (as the Grothendieck school would see it); but geometrically it is more like a compactification question, as the stability criteria revealed. The restriction to non-singular varieties will not lead to a compact space in any sense as moduli space: varieties can degenerate to having singularities. On the other hand, the points that would correspond to highly singular varieties are definitely too 'bad' to include in the answer. The correct middle ground, of points stable enough to be admitted, was isolated by Mumford's work. The concept was not entirely new, since certain aspects of it were to be found in David Hilbert's final ideas on invariant theory, before he moved on to other fields. The book's Preface also enunciated the Mumford conjecture, later proved by William Haboush. Stability If a reductive group G acts linearly on a vector space V, then a non-zero point of V is called *unstable if 0 is in the closure of its orbit, *semi-stable if 0 is not in the closure of its orbit, *stable if its orbit is closed, and its stabilizer is finite. There are equivalent ways to state these (this criterion is known as the Hilbert‚ÄìMumford criterion): *A non-zero point x is unstable if and only if there is a 1-parameter subgroup of G all of whose weights with respect to x are positive. *A non-zero point x is unstable if and only if every invariant polynomial has the same value on 0 and x. *A non-zero point x is semistable if and only if there is no 1-parameter subgroup of G all of whose weights with respect to x are positive. *A non-zero point x is semistable if and only if some invariant polynomial has different values on 0 and x. *A non-zero point x is stable if and only if every 1-parameter subgroup of G has positive (and negative) weights with respect to x. *A non-zero point x is stable if and only if for every y not in the orbit of x there is some invariant polynomial that has different values on y and x, and the ring of invariant polynomials has transcendence degree dim(V)‚àídim(G). A point of the corresponding projective space of V is called unstable, semi-stable, or stable if it is the image of a point in V with the same property. \\"Unstable\\" is the opposite of \\"semistable\\" (not \\"stable\\"). The unstable points form a Zariski closed set of projective space, while the semistable and stable points both form Zariski open sets (possibly empty). These definitions are from and are not equivalent to the ones in the first edition of Mumford's book. Many moduli spaces can be constructed as the quotients of the space of stable points of some subset of projective space by some group action. These spaces can often be compactified by adding certain equivalence classes of semistable points. Different stable orbits correspond to different points in the quotient, but two different semistable orbits may correspond to the same point in the quotient if their closures intersect. Example: A stable curve is a reduced connected curve of genus ‚â•2 such that its only singularities are ordinary double points and every non-singular rational component meets the other components in at least 3 points. The moduli space of stable curves of genus g is the quotient of a subset of the Hilbert scheme of curves in P5g-6 with Hilbert polynomial (6n‚àí1)(g‚àí1) by the group PGL5g‚àí5. Example: A vector bundle W over an algebraic curve (or over a Riemann surface) is a stable vector bundle if and only if :\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{\\\\deg(V)}{\\\\hbox{rank}(V)} < \\\\frac{\\\\deg(W)}{\\\\hbox{rank}(W)} for all proper non-zero subbundles V of W and is semistable if this condition holds with < replaced by ‚â§.

In the Metropolitan Borough of OldhamCommunity Councils, Oldham Council website, accessed 5 March 2008 and the London Borough of Southwark non-statutory consultation bodies have been established, called community councils. There are thirty-eight charitable rural community councils with a rural development function, covering areas such as community planning, community buildings support, rural transport schemes and rural affordable housing (exception sites). The rural community councils are linked by the charity ACRE (Action with Communities in Rural England) and form the Rural Community Action Network (RCAN). Established in 1947, the National Association of Local Councils is the national body which represents the interests of 10,000 local (parish and town) councils and 100,000 councillors across England. NALC works to support, promote and improve local councils. Local councils is a universal term in England for community, neighbourhood, parish and town councils, which are the first tier of English local government. The process for establishing a local council requires a signed petition by at least 7.5% of the local electorate (more signatures if there are less than 2,500 electors). The local authority will then undertake a 'governance review' to assess the request and to make a final decision. Scotland In Scotland community councils have fewer powers than their English or Welsh counterparts. As of July 2012, there were 1,369 community council areas in Scotland, some of which represent several communities within their boundary.The 1,369 community council areas are listed for each council area, and cited, at List of community council areas in Scotland Community councils were introduced in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The duty was placed on the newly established district councils to prepare an establishment scheme to divide their district into community council areas. In 1996 this duty passed to the present area councils. Scotland's network of parishes was abolished for administrative purposes in 1930, when larger district councils were formed. Unlike Wales, the new CCs created in 1975 were not necessarily based on old parish areas, which no longer fit any modern administrative areas. Several of them are based on former burghs, and have rematriculated the burgh coat of arms and use the title \\"provost\\" for their chairman. The Acts of Parliament governing community councils allow for them to \\"take any action\\" they deem appropriate to improve their community. They set out the requirements of each local authority's \\"scheme for the establishment of Community Councils\\". All of Scotland has had community council areas delineated, the numbers and boundaries of which can be altered by the area council. However not all communities have community councils, which in Scotland are statutory and only exist if local people are willing to stand for election. They are officially stated to be \\"non-party- political and non-sectarian\\" in their discussions and decision making. Community councils must adopt a constitution stating the name of the community council and dealing with such matters as the frequency of meetings, office bearers, method of election, finance and standing orders. There have been a number of reviews of the role of community councils in Scotland, generally emphasising their importance to democratic renewal. One important one was the McIntosh Report on Local Government and the Scottish Parliament. Membership of community councils consists of: *Elected members: The local authority's establishment scheme details the number of elected councillors, and the areas for which they shall be elected. Some community councils currently allow: *Co- opted members: The community council may co-opt additional members with particular skills or interests that will assist them in their work. These members may be co-opted for a specific period of time, or dismissed at the community council's pleasure. It is permitted for persons of between 14 and 18 years of age to be co-opted to represent the interests of \\"youth\\". *Ex officio members: The constitutions of many community councils provide that the area councillor for the ward containing the community council area, local MPs and MSPs shall be ex officio members. Co-opted and ex officio members have no votes on the councils and may not be office bearers. The establishment scheme will set out the exact procedure for establishing a council where one does not exist: a stated number of local government electors in the designated area must petition the area council, who will then schedule elections. In the case of all community council elections, if nominations are received for less than fifty percent of the seats, the election is postponed and the council not formed or dissolved. Community councils can only be dissolved if the number of elected members falls below the set minimum. Community councils can also choose to amalgamate themselves with an adjoining community council by a similar process. Like in England and Wales, the main role of the CCs is to act as a channel of the opinions of the local community, and have the right to be notified of and respond to any planning applications. They are also sometimes involved in local projects mostly related to local infrastructure such as footpaths, parks, playgrounds etc., and local events. Unlike in England and Wales, Scottish CCs do not have the right to raise funds by setting a precept on local taxes, and are instead dependent upon local authority funding, which is usually received for running costs only. In some areas of Scotland, CCs are often disregarded and are not usually viewed as a tier of government, even though they can legally have that role. Although in places such as Orkney and Shetland, CCs are viewed as an important part of local government, and receive larger budgets. Wales Until 1974 Wales was divided into civil parishes. These were abolished by section 20(6) of the Local Government Act 1972, and replaced by communities by section 27 of the same Act. The principal areas of Wales are divided entirely into communities. Unlike in England, where unparished areas exist, no part of Wales is outside a community, even in urban areas. Not every community has a council, however. Community councils in Wales are identical to English parish councils in terms of their powers and the way they operate. Welsh community councils may call themselves town councils unilaterally and may have city status granted by the Crown. In Wales, all town councils are community councils. There are currently three community councils with city status: Bangor, St Asaph and St David's. The community of Caernarfon has the status of a royal town. The chair of a town council or city council will usually have the title mayor. In communities with populations too small to justify a full community council, community meetings will be established. Community councils in Wales now come under the Local Government (Wales) Measure 2011 under Part 7. One Voice Wales was established in 2004 and is the main organisation for community and town councils in Wales. The association represents the interests of councils across Wales and offers a range of other support services. One Voice Wales is also a portal for advice on how to set up a new council or to become a councillor. Elections are held every five years under the 'first past the post' voting system. There are 735 community and town councils and 8,000 councillors in Wales, covering approximately 94% of the land area and 70% of the population of Wales. The process for establishing a local council in Wales differs from England and Scotland. It requires the community to organise a public meeting, and for a majority of those present, to then agree to hold a community poll. A minimum 10% of the total local government community electorate or 150 electors (if 10% exceeds 150) must be present and voting at this meeting. If a poll is agreed upon, the local authority must organise one at least 42 days after the decision to hold the poll was taken. A simple majority is required in the poll for a community or town council to be created. A poll cannot take place more than once every two years, if previously rejected.

The station is served by Thameslink trains on the Sutton Loop Line. It is in Travelcard Zone 5. It is close to Gander Green Lane, the home ground of Sutton United. History Parliamentary approval for a line from Wimbledon to Sutton had been obtained by the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway (W&SR;) in 1910 but work had been delayed by World War I. From the W&SR;'s inception, the District Railway (DR) was a shareholder of the company and had rights to run trains over the line when built. In the 1920s, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL, precursor of London Underground) planned, through its ownership of the DR, to use part of the route for an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;, now the Northern line) to Sutton. The SR objected and an agreement was reached that enabled the C&SLR; to extend as far as Morden in exchange for the UERL giving up its rights over the W&SR; route. The SR subsequently built the line, one of the last to be built in the London area. West Sutton station replaced the UERL's planned Cheam station on Cheam Road to the south. The station opened on 5 January 1930 when full services on the line were extended from South Merton. Services Throughout the day Thameslink operates 2 trains per hour to St Albans via Wimbledon and London Blackfriars (clockwise around the loop), and 2 trains per hour to Sutton (anticlockwise). Services to Sutton then continue back to St Albans via Mitcham Junction. Additionally, on weekdays Southern operates a limited service anticlockwise around the loop to London Bridge via Sutton and Mitcham Junction (morning peak only) and clockwise to London Bridge via Wimbledon (evening peak only).

He is often known by his Old Occitan name, Guilhem de Cabestaing, Cabestang, Cabestan, or Cabestanh (pronounced ).  Life  Not much reliable information is known about Guillem de Cabestany. He is probably the son of Arnau de Cabestany, a noble of Roussillon, and a vassal in relation with the lords of Castell Rossell√≥. Cabestany itself is a fief located immediately next to the east of Castell Rossell√≥ and southwest of Canet (a future viscounty). According to Pere Tomich, Guillem de Cabestany fought alongside Peter II of Aragon at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa against the Almohads in 1212.  Legend  According to his legendary vida, he was the lover of Margarida or Seremonda (or Soremonda), wife of Raimon of Castell Rossell√≥. On discovering their affair, Raimon fed Cabestany's heart to Seremonda. When he told her what she had eaten, she threw herself from the window to her death. The vida precedes Cabestany's poem Lo dous cossire in his Chansonnier I. It is translated alongside the Old Occitan in Margarita Egan's 1984 edition The vidas of the troubadours. Versions of this legend appear later in Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron (1348-53), Stendhal's On Love (1822), and in Ezra Pound's Canto IV (1924-25). It also inspired the opera Written on Skin (2012) by George Benjamin and Martin Crimp. Seremonda is thought to have been married two or three times, first to Raimon of Castell Rossell√≥, to another husband in 1210, and then to Aymar de Mosset. De Mosset probably fought alongside Cabestany in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. Raimon himself lived peacefully in Castell Rossell√≥ until at least 1218. Medievalist John E. Matzke has identified at least fourteen different versions of the \\"eaten heart\\" legend in several different literary traditions. Cabestany's vida may not be the earliest version. With reference to regional historian Jules Canonge, Cabestany is presented as the archetypal troubador in Ford Madox Ford's book Provence. Known works Some of Cabestany's poems were published along with his vida by Fran√ßois-Juste-Marie Raynouard in 1816. All of Cabestany's works have been published by Michel Adroher in side-by-side Old Occitan and Modern French. Nine extant songs are attributed to Cabestany, of which two are uncertain.

It runs northerly from a triangular junction with the Great Western Main Line west of West Ealing to a central bay platform at Greenford station, where it has cross-platform interchanges to the London Underground's Central line. A triangular junction near Greenford connects to the Acton‚ÄìNortholt line (formerly the New North Main Line). The line serves mainly the suburbs of Ealing and Greenford. History A Class 121 diesel multiple unit in BR Network SouthEast livery at London Paddington station for the Greenford service (1988). The opening of the line in 1903 coincided with the opening of a station at Park Royal on the Acton‚ÄìNortholt line to serve the Royal Agricultural Show held in the grounds of part of the Twyford Abbey Estate. The Show ran from 15 June 1903 to 4 July 1903 during which period trains operated a circular service to and from Paddington via Park Royal and Ealing. Normal services started on 2 May 1904 and the links to Greenford station were put in on 1 October 1904. The loop formed by the GWML, the branch and the ANL is sometimes used for turning trains for operational reasons such as balancing wheel wear. On weekends in 2008 during engineering works on the West Coast Main Line the line was used by Virgin Trains' Euston-Birmingham International \\"Blockade Buster\\" service which ran to Euston via Willesden, Acton Main Line, Ealing Broadway, Greenford, High Wycombe, Banbury and Coventry using pairs of 5-car Voyager sets. On two Sundays in February 2010, Chiltern and Wrexham & Shropshire trains were diverted to Paddington via the line while engineering work blocked the route to Marylebone. Locally the service is called the 'Push-and-pull', a term which dates from the days of steam, when the engine could not change ends at Greenford and so the locomotive pulled the carriages one way and pushed them on the return run (see GWR Autocoach). In the 1950s the service frequently ran with two auto- trailers, one either side of the engine. During the 1960s and '70s the service was normally operated by a 'Bubble Car' two-carriage diesel railcar, although this was later reduced to a single carriage. As , and have short platforms the maximum length of train that can be used is two cars. In preparation for Crossrail, a new platform 5 has been constructed at West Ealing, and (as of January 2017) all services have been diverted to terminate there. Current service The passenger service is provided by Great Western Railway. Trains from the branch terminate at West Ealing, except for one service from Paddington at the start of the day, and to Paddington at the end of the day. There is a parliamentary service operated by Chiltern Railways from 10 December 2018 that - during the weekday - starts from South Ruislip and non- stops through to West Ealing and returns to High Wycombe. All services are operated with two-car Class 165 Turbo diesel trains. There is no Sunday service.

All the Mowgli Stories is a collection of short stories by Rudyard Kipling. As the title suggests, the book is a chronological compilation of the stories about Mowgli from The Jungle Book and The Second Jungle Book, together with \\"In the Rukh\\" (the first Mowgli story written, although the last in chronological order). The book also includes the epigrammatic poems added to the stories for their original book publication. All of the stories and poems had originally been published between 1893 and 1895. The book was first published under this title in 1933 by Macmillan and Co., containing colour plates and pen illustrations by Stuart Tresilian. Its contents are virtually identical to The Works of Rudyard Kipling Volume VII: The Jungle Book, part of a multi-volume set which had appeared in 1907. (A companion volume, The Works of Rudyard Kipling Volume VIII: The Jungle Book collects all of the non-Mowgli stories from the two Jungle Books.) ContentsShort stories= #Mowgli's Brothers #Kaa's Hunting #How Fear Came - During a drought, Mowgli and the animals gather at a shrunken Wainganga River for a Water Truce where the display of the blue- coloured Peace Rock prevents anyone from hunting at its riverbanks. After Shere Khan was driven away by him for nearly defiling the Peace Rock, Hathi the elephant tells Mowgli the story of how the first tiger got his stripes when fear first came to the jungle. #Tiger!

The Southern Railway (SR) objected and an agreement was reached that enabled the C&SLR; to extend as far as Morden in exchange for the UERL giving up its rights over the W&SR; route. The SR subsequently built the line, one of the last to be built in the London area. The station opened on 5 January 1930 when full services on the line were extended from South Merton. The original concrete station building has been demolished. Services Throughout the day Thameslink operates 2 trains per hour to St Albans via Wimbledon and London Blackfriars (clockwise around the loop), and 2 trains per hour to Sutton (anticlockwise). Services to Sutton then continue back to St Albans via Mitcham Junction. Additionally, on weekdays Southern operates a limited service anticlockwise around the loop to London Bridge via Sutton and Mitcham Junction (morning peak only) and clockwise to London Bridge via Wimbledon (evening peak only). St Helier station is unmanned. It has electronic display boards. Connections London Buses routes 154 and S4 serve the station.

It began forming in the southern sector of the Eastern Front in late 1942, but was never completed due to the loss of its assets during the Soviet counteroffensives in the Battle of Stalingrad, and no further attempts were made to reconstitute the division.  Operational history  During summer-autumn 1942, part of the division was formed in France, including the division's artillery regiment. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Front, the Brigade Michalik (led by Colonel Helmut Michalik) was formed around the 140th Panzer Grenadier Regiment (which was previously part of 22nd Panzer Division).Mitcham, Samuel W. (2007). German Order of Battle Vol.3, p.71 In autumn 1942, the two echelons joined in Voronezh, situated then in the rear area of the German 2nd Army, and the division was formally activated on 1 October 1942. With about 3,000 men its strength was well under that required for a Panzer Division; however the situation required that it had to be scattered in several groups to support different sectors of the Eastern Front: Don, south of Kharkov, Hungarian 2nd Army, Italian 8th Army. Twenty tanks were incorporated into the German 2nd Army Headquarters. The 127th Pz.Eng.Batt. never joined the rest of the division, as it was one of the units encircled at Stalingrad, where it was destroyed.Mitcham, Samuel W. (2007). German Order of Battle Vol.3, pp. 71‚Äì72 By 1 January 1943, the unit was depleted: it had only half of its mechanised infantry and 11 tanks left. The estimated total strength was less than 1,600 men by 8 February. Once the Soviet winter offensive, Operation Little Saturn, was stopped, the 27th Panzer was disbanded around 3 March 1943. The personnel of the 127th Panzer and 127th Panzer Signals Battalions were assigned to the 24th Panzer Division in France, while the remaining men and materiel were incorporated into the 7th Panzer Division in Russia.Mitcham, Samuel W.

Contests are typically eight to ten minutes long, although some competitions can last up to thirty minutes, with the person consuming the most food being declared the winner. Competitive eating is most popular in the United States, Canada and Japan, where organized professional eating contests often offer prizes, including cash. History Pie-eating contest at the Jefferson School in Washington, D.C., August 2, 1923 Traditionally, eating contests, often involving pies, were events at county fairs. The recent surge in the popularity of competitive eating is due in large part to the development of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, an annual holiday tradition that has been held on July 4 every year since 1916 at Coney Island. In 2001, Takeru Kobayashi ate 50 hot dogs ‚Äì smashing the previous record (25.5). The event generates enormous media attention and has been aired on ESPN for the past eight years, contributing to the growth of the competitive eating phenomenon. Kobayashi won the competition every year from 2001 until 2006 but was dethroned in 2007 by Joey Chestnut. In 2008, Chestnut and Kobayashi tied at 59 hot dogs in 10 minutes (the time span had previously been 12 minutes) and Chestnut won in an eat-off in which he was the first of the two competitors to finish eating 5 hot dogs, earning him a second consecutive title. Kobayashi holds six Guinness World Records, for eating hot dogs, meatballs, Twinkies, hamburgers, and pizza. He competed in hot dog contests in 2011 and 2012 and claimed to have eaten 68 and 69. The current champion is Chestnut, with a total of 75 hot dogs and buns eaten on July 4, 2020. OrganizationsAll Pro Eating= All Pro Eating Competitive Eaters include Molly Schuyler, Eric \\"Silo\\" Dahl, Jamie \\"The Bear\\" McDonald and Stephanie \\"Xanadu\\" Torres (who died). =IFOCE= The International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE) hosts nearly 50 \\"Major League Eating\\" events across North America every year. =Other challenges= Other eating contests sponsored by restaurants can involve a challenge to eat large or extraordinarily spicy food items, including giant steaks, hamburgers and curries in a set amount of time. Those who finish the item are often rewarded by getting the item for free, a T-shirt and the addition of their name and/or photo on a wall of challenge victors. For example, Ward's House of Prime located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has a prime rib meat challenge. The current record is 360 ounces by Molly Schuyler in June 2017. Various challenges of this type are featured in the Travel Channel show Man v. Food. The Great American Eat Off - a show that pits two average eaters against each other to see who can eat the fastest, while raising awareness for charity and then brings in a professional competitive eater to beat the winning time, raises the stakes for competitive eaters by incorporating various challenges and obstacles that would interfere with their speed. Obstacles may include eating with two spoons, eating with no hands, or Interval Eating where the competitive eater is permitted to eat for a limited time and then must rest for a specific time (i.e., eat 20 seconds, rest 40 seconds, eat 20 seconds, rest 40 seconds etc.) until they have completed the designated food. Interval Eating was created by Gail Kasper. Notable competitive eaters *Joey Chestnut *Matt Stonie *Takeru Kobayashi *Theetta Rappai *Leah Shutkever Contest structureFood= The type of food used in contests varies greatly, with each contest typically only using one type of food (e.g. a hot dog eating contest). Foods used in professional eating contests include hamburgers, hot dogs, pies, pancakes, chicken wings, asparagus, pizza, ribs, whole turkeys, among many other types of food. There is also a vegan hot dog eating competition held in Austin, Texas. =Rules and overview of events= Competitive eating contests often adhere to an 8, 10, 12, or 15 minute time limit. Most contests are presided over by a master of ceremonies, whose job is to announce the competitors prior to the contest and keep the audience engaged throughout the contest with enthusiastic play-by-play commentary and amusing anecdotes. A countdown from 10 usually takes place at the end of the contest, with all eating coming to an end with the expiration of time. Many professional contests also employ a series of judges, whose role is to enforce the contest rules and warn eaters about infractions. Judges will also be called upon to count or weigh each competitor's food and certify the results of the contest prior to the winner being announced. Many eaters will attempt to put as much food in their mouths as possible during the final seconds of a contest, a practice known by professionals as \\"chipmunking.\\"Force Fed Creative Loafing blog May 9, 2007. Retrieved on June 30, 2009. If chipmunking is allowed in a contest, eaters are given a reasonable amount of time (typically less than two minutes) to swallow the food or risk a deduction from their final totals. In many contests, eaters are allowed to dunk foods in water or other liquids in order to soften the food and make it easier to chew and swallow. Dunking typically takes place with foods involving a bun or other doughy parts. Professional contests often enforce a limit on the number of times competitors are allowed to dunk food. Competitors are required to maintain a relatively clean eating surface throughout the contest. Excess debris after the contest results in a deduction from the eater's final totals. If, at any point during or immediately after the contest, a competitor regurgitates any food, he or she will be disqualified. Vomiting, also known as a \\"reversal\\", or, as ESPN and the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest call it, a \\"reversal of fortune\\", includes obvious signs of vomiting as well as any small amounts of food that may fall from the mouth deemed by judges to have come from the stomach. Small amounts of food already in the mouth prior to swallowing are excluded from this rule. Training and preparation Many professional competitive eaters undergo rigorous personal training in order to increase their stomach capacity and eating speed with various foods. Stomach elasticity is usually considered the key to eating success, and competitors commonly train by drinking large amounts of water over a short time to stretch out the stomach. Others combine the consumption of water with large quantities of low calorie foods such as vegetables or salads. Some eaters chew large amounts of gum in order to build jaw strength.Eating champs to chow down at Everett wingding by Brian Alexander Perhaps paradoxically, maintaining a low body fat percentage is thought to be helpful in competitive eating; this is known as the belt of fat theory. For a marquee event like the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, some eaters, like current contest champion Joey Chestnut, will begin training several months before the event with personal time trials using the contest food.Dworkin, Andy. \\"Champion competitive eater shares his training, victory\\" The Oregonian online.

It is made of reinforced concrete shaped in a hyperboloid form. The tower's architect is Karel Hub√°ƒçek who was assisted by Zdenƒõk Patrman, involved in building statics, and by Otakar Binar who designed the interior furnishing. It took the team three years to finalize the structure design (1963-1966). The construction itself took seven years to finish (1966-1973). The hyperboloid shape was chosen since it naturally extends the silhouette of the hill and, moreover, well resists the extreme climate conditions on the Je≈°tƒõd summit. The design cleverly combines the operation of a mountain-top hotel and a television transmitter in one. The hotel and the restaurant are located in the lowest sections of the tower. Before the construction of the current hotel, there were already two huts standing near the mountain summit: one was built in the middle of the 19th century and the other was added in the early 20th century. Both buildings had a wooden structure and both burned to the ground in the 1960s. The tower is one of the dominant features of the North Bohemian landscape. The gallery on the found floor and the restaurant on the first floor offer views of much of Bohemia and parts of Poland and Germany. The tower silhouette appears on the region flag and the coat-of-arms, and on the local university's logo and on the logo of the local first-league soccer club Slovan Liberec. The building is also featured in the Czech movie Grandhotel based on book by Jaroslav Rudi≈°. The tower has been on the list of the Czech cultural monuments since 1998, becoming a national cultural monument in 2006. In 2007 it was entered on the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage sites. In 1969 Karel Hub√°ƒçek was awarded the prestigious Perret Prize of the International Union of Architects (UIA). The monument is accessible by road and also by a cable car from the foot of the mountain.  Construction  After the existing Je≈°tƒõd hut burned down in January 1963, a decision was made by Restaurace Liberec ( company that used to manage the burnt down huts) and the Prague Radio Communications Administration to build a new complex on the Je≈°tƒõd mountain summit, which would accommodate a mountain hotel including a restaurant and at the same time would serve as a TV signal transmitter. An architectural competition for the building design was announced. It took place in February 1963 on the Liberec Stavoprojekt premises. Eleven architects/teams took part in the competition, including individual architects Otakar Binar, Ji≈ô√≠ Svoboda, Pavel ≈†vancer, Ota Nykod√Ωm, Karel Hub√°ƒçek, Jarom√≠r Syrov√°tko, Miroslav Ulmann, Jarom√≠r Vacek and teams Josef Patrn√Ω - Ji≈ô√≠ Hubka - V. Netoliƒçka, Milo≈° Technik and Svatopluk Technik. Hub√°ƒçek's design was the only one complying with both the requirements. All the designs were put on public display in the Liberec branch of ƒåeskoslovensk√° spo≈ôitelna. The jury (aka the council of Liberec district national committee) on its April 22, 1963 meeting chose Hub√°ƒçek's proposal as the winner. The building design created some technical problems for Hub√°ƒçek and his team due to the climate conditions at the Je≈°tƒõd summit. Experts from the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, the Czech Technical University in Prague (ƒåVUT) and the Liberec Institute of Textile and Mechanical Engineering helped to overcome the technical difficulties. The technological equipment and procedures that were put together were protected by the Czechoslovak patents. Some elements (such as the laminated cladding, the special pendulum or the transverse damper) introduced by Zdenƒõk Patrman in collaboration with the Academy experts were since then included in other structures (e.g. the Cukr√°k transmitter tower) The ceremonial laying of the foundation stone took place on July 30, 1966. The general contractor was Pozemn√≠ stavby from Liberec. On 1 May 1971 the transmitter began its operation. However, the hotel interiors and the restaurant were completed two years later. On July 9, 1973, the Je≈°tƒõd Tower grand opening took place. The total construction was 64 million Czechoslovak crowns (in 1973).  Awards  In 1964, the Association of Architects of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic awarded the Je≈°tƒõd Tower design on its annual Architectural Works 1962‚Äì63 exhibit. In spring of 1969, at a time when the building had not yet been completed, Karel Hub√°ƒçek was awarded the Auguste Perret Prize for the creative use of technology in architecture by the International Union of Architects. It is the most significant award ever achieved by a Czech architect. In 2000, the building was awarded the title ‚ÄúThe Most Important Czech Building of the 20th Century‚Äù In September 2005, in the iDNES.cz ‚ÄúSeven Wonders of the Czech Republic‚Äù readers survey the tower ranked as second being defeated by the Pumped storage hydro power plant at Dlouh√© str√°nƒõ.  National monument  On 26 March 1998, the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic registered the building as an immovable cultural monument. On January 2006, the building was declared a national cultural monument. On May 29, 2007, it was added to the Indicative List of Cultural Property of the Czech Republic, of which buildings are nominated for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Description Structure = The tower foundation consists of a circular reinforced concrete slab with a thickness of 1 meter and a diameter of 13.40 meters . The foundation is laid in the altitude of 1004.75 meters. The load-bearing element of the structure consists of two concentric reinforced concrete rollers with inner diameters of 4.4 and 12.5 meters (and a wall thicknesses of 30 centimeters); the narrower is 42.4 meters high, the wider (external) is 22.5 meters high. On the tubes the individual floors are suspended on a steel structure, starting with the second floor. The columns were manufactured by Pr≈Ømstav Pardubice. The supporting steel structures for the floors and for the tower structure were manufactured in the Most√°rna plant in the then state- owned company V√≠tkovice Iron Works of Klement Gottwald. A steel shell with a length of 44 meters of a variable diameter (from 10.50 meters to 1.62 meters) is attached to the inner column The laminate support roller (diameter of 1.90 meters and a wall thickness of 16 to 12 millimeters) attached to it, originally had a length of 17.52 meters which was extended another 3 meters during the 1997 reconstruction. alt= = Floors = In the basement of the building, there are engine rooms and warehouses. The first floor is shared by the administrative offices and the television transmission hall that is connected to the antenna systems on the ninth floor by means of an elevator and an emergency staircase built inside the central tube. The rest of the first floor is occupied by the restaurant kitchen. On the second floor there is an observation terrace, a buffet and the main entrance hall with the reception desk. The hall is dominated by a suspended staircase leading to an observation restaurant on third floor. On the fourth and fifth floor there are hotel rooms. On the fourth floor there are 12 double rooms and one apartment. Rooms on the fifth floor were originally used as flats for the hotel and transmitter employees but were later converted to hotel apartments. The sixth and seventh floors house the transmitting technology.There is a specially developed laminated cladding in the shape of a revolving hyperboloid shielding against extreme weather conditions. On the eighth and ninth floors the architect placed drinking water tanks and a backup battery power supply. There is an elevator engine room on the tenth floor. Above it a special pendulum is installed, movement of which absorb cross vibrations caused by the wind. left = Exterior = At the third to the fifth floor levels (i.e. the restaurant and hotel floors) the outer shell takes on the shape of a conical rotating surface. It consists of 64 conically placed panels. The panel surface is made of anodized aluminium sheets. At the restaurant level, these panels are glazed over the entire width and complemented by a low window sill, while at the hotel level there are smaller windows with rounded corners. Parabolic antennas of microwave transmitters are located on the seventh and eighth floors. The building cover is made of trapezoid-shaped laminated panels, which are not joined by any metal elements, as these would prevent the passage of electromagnetic waves. The upper side of the elevator machine room on the tenth floor is fitted with a welded steel tube, which forms a 48 meter high antenna mast. Its surface is covered with metallized aluminum and a spiral staircase leads up inside the tube. An the top of the mast there is a self- supporting laminate extension of 18 meters attached. During the 1997 transmitter reconstruction it was extended by another 3 meters. The extension is there to protect the TV broadcast antennas against the elements. On top of the extension there is a steel lid, on which an annular pendulum weighing 800 kg is suspended by means of dampers. left = Interior design = The interior design including its furniture comes from Otakar Binar. Cookware and some textile accessories were based on Karl W√ºnsch designs. Glass makers Stanislav Libensk√Ω and his partner Jaroslava Brychtov√° also participated in the interior furnishing. They originally planned inserting a tall glass pendulum in the publicly accessible space. The pendulum would consist of two lenses representing the eternal movement. Instead, they decided to drill eight glass emblems into the concrete transmitter shaft. According to the artists, the shaft and its modification suggested the tower was growing up from the rock. On the other hand, for Karel Hub√°ƒçekt the glass emblems embodied fallen meteorites. The author of the trellis located in the hotel corridor is Jaroslav Kl√°p≈°tƒõ. The staircase walls and the hotel corridors are lined with ceramic tiles designed by Dƒõvana M√≠rov√°. The entrance doors and the hotel reception walls are covered with wrought sheets by Milo≈° Ko≈°ka, the tapestry hanging on the lounge wall was created by Vladim√≠r K≈ôeƒçan. = Transmitter = On 1 May 1971, the transmitter (equipped with Tesla III-Zona) began broadcasting television signal from the new tower. In September 1973, broadcasting of the second Czechoslovak Television program was added. After the Velvet Revolution, the transmitter (using a Tesla equipment) was spreading signals of Czech Television (ƒåT1 and ƒåT2), Nova and Prima and Czech Radio (Radio≈æurn√°l, Praha (today Dvojka) and Vltava) and of private operators ( Radio Proglas, Radio Contact Liberec and Europe 2). In connection with the broadcasting digitization in the Czech Republic, in June 2009 the antenna systems in the laminate extension were updated. In addition to radio and television broadcasting, Jested is also an important node for radio relay and optical links. Mobile operators T-Mobile, O2, Vodafone and Nordic Telecom have base stations (BTS) here.

From the summit there are views into Germany and Poland. The Horn√≠ Hanychov region of Liberec lies just below the mountain. On the summit is the Je≈°tƒõd Tower restaurant, hotel and television tower, designed by Karel Hub√°ƒçek, accessible by road or cable car (Je≈°tƒõd Cable car). The mountain also has a ski resort. History The origin of the mountain's name is uncertain, it is probably from the term Ash mountain, a once dominant tree species in the area. The Czech name for the mountain was first recorded in 1545 as Jesstied (pod horou Jesstiedem). The German form of the name, Jeschke, was first mentioned in 1565. As far back as 1838 the summit hosted a crude stone that serves as a landmark to this day. The first hut on the summit was erected as early as 1844. In the 1860s, the mountain ridge was Station No. 4 of the first order of the Royal Saxon triangulation. For this reason a measuring station was built on the summit. In 1906, the Mountain Club, a mountain hotel, was built. The Jeschke Horn√≠ Hanychov cable car to the summit was opened in 1933. On 23 August 1940, at midnight, a Heinkel He 111 from the Second (Lion) Squadron () from L√ºneburg crashed into the mountain near the summit and tore a long swathe in the woods. This accident killed the four crew. The old mountain hotel burned down in 1963. Between 1966 and 1973, a futuristic hotel, with a 100-metre-high television tower, was built that was designed by the architect, Karel Hub√°ƒçek. For the construction of the TV tower, Hub√°ƒçek was awarded the Auguste Perret Prize. The modern building acts as a lookout tower, transmission tower, hotel and restaurant.

Its primary method of transportation was gliders. The division played a significant role in the development of modern day air assault operations.http://semo.edu/pdf/showmegold-AA-guide.pdf History Created as 22. Infanterie-Division in 1935, one regiment participated in the 1939 Invasion of Poland; the rest of the division stayed in garrison on the Siegfried Line in case of a French attack in defense of Poland. The division retrained as 22. Luftlande-Division (Air Landing Division) for rapid tactical deployment to capture enemy airbases and performed in that role during the invasion of the Netherlands suffering heavy losses during the failed Battle for The Hague (operation ‚ÄúFall Festung‚Äù), and afterward advanced into France operating as ordinary ground infantry. Though planned for use in its air- landing role for the Battle of Crete, it was replaced by another division at the last minute. It joined Army Group South in Operation Barbarossa (1941), attacking from Romania and, operating exclusively as ordinary ground infantry, helped storm Sevastopol in the Crimea (1942). The unit was thereafter transferred to Crete for garrison duty in \\"Fortress Crete\\" and mop-up operations in the Aegean, playing a major role in the Battle of Leros under the command of Generalmajor Friedrich-Wilhelm M√ºller. During September 1943, forces of the unit committed numerous atrocities in Viannos. On 26 April 1944 the divisional commander, Generalmajor Heinrich Kreipe, was abducted by a British Special Operations Executive team led by Major Patrick Leigh Fermor and Capt Bill Stanley Moss. Kreipe's car was ambushed at night on the way from the divisional headquarters at Ano Archanes to the Villa Ariadne at Knossos and he was taken cross-country over the mountains to the south coast where he and his captors were picked up by a British vessel near Rodakino on 14 May. This operation was later portrayed in the book Ill Met by Moonlight (1950) written by Moss based on his wartime diaries, later adapted as a film of the same name. In late summer 1944, forces of the division were involved in more atrocities in Anogeia and Amari. Withdrawn to the mainland in autumn 1944, the 22. Infanterie-Division spent the rest of the war in anti-partisan operations in Macedonia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in southeastern Europe, was renamed 22. Volksgrenadier-Division in March 1945, as it withdrew to Slavonia and finally surrendered to Yugoslav forces at the end of the war in May in Slovenia.

He was born in Zaragoza but ancestrally he was descended from the House of Carrascon of √Ågreda (Castile), Cintruenigo (Navarra) and Tudela (Navarra). The founder of the Spanish House was Doctor Don Garcia Fernandez de Carrasc√≥n (ca 1480-1533), a wealthy Spanish cleric from √Ågreda, Spain who was a protonotary apostolic and personal doctor to Pope Adrian VI as well as a canon of the Cathedral of Toledo, Spain. He left his fortune in the form of a mayorazgo or family trust to his nephew Don Pedro Carrascon and his descendants. Doctor Carrascon is buried in an elaborate chapel in the Church of San Miguel Arcangel in √Ågreda. The Carrascon were recognized as having Hidalgo or noble status in the mid 17th Century, but were noble going back to at least the 15th Century. Don Francisco served as War Commissioner (Comisario de Guerra) in Orbetello in 1737‚Äì1738 just after the War of Polish Succession, and in Messina from 1739 to 1755. He was a close associate of the founder of the Passionist Order, St. Paul of the Cross and he is mentioned frequently in his letters from the era. Don Francisco was appointed Senator of Messina in 1742 under the Viceroy of Sicily, Don Eustachio, Duke of Laviefuille. He was the only one of the six senators to survive the Messina Plague of 1743. After a few decades on the Italian peninsula, he and his descendants became known by the italianized spelling of the surname Carascon. Don Francisco was married to Donna Paula Diez, believed to be the sister of Don Antonio Filareto Diez e Palermo, a Sicilian Nobleman and Senator of Palermo in 1745 and 1764. Don Francisco and Donna Paula had five sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Don Bernabe (or Barnaba) Carrascon was a Colonel in command of the Provincial Regiments of the Kingdom of Naples, and later Commandant of Lucera. His second son, Don Antonio Carrascon, was a Lieutenant Colonel and Governor of the Fortress of Vieste on the Adriatic Sea. The other sons, Don Pietro Ignazio, Don Ferdinando and Don Francisco the Younger, also distinguished themselves in civil service and the military. Of the daughters, Donna Maria Giuseppa Carascon married Don Berlingiero Scoppa of Lucera, Donna Marianna Carascon married Colonel Don Orsino Scoppa of Lucera. Donna Concetta Carascon married Cavaliere Gaetano Pistorio of Messina. Don Francisco's older brother, Don Pietro Carrascon, was a Commissario Ordinatore (Chief Financial and Military officer in the Neapolitan Army) based in Naples and Orbetello during his career. Don Pietro and his wife, Donna Maria Teresa Remon, had three children: Don Gabriele, Don Pietro the younger and Donna Marianna. Donna Marianna married Don Giuseppe Fernandez d'Espinosa, brother in law of one of the leaders of the Parthenopean Republic, Gabriele Manthone. Don Francsico also had a sister, Donna Bernarda Carascon, who married the Governor of Pescara, Don Gioacchino (Joaquin) Fernandez d'Espinosa, father of the aforementioned Don Giuseppe and grandfather of Gabriele Manthone. A descendant of Don Francisco also formed a pre-unification matrimonial alliance with the Bourbon royalist Criscuolo family of quartiere San Ferdinando, Naples.

Details about the move and the game plan White opens with the most popular of the twenty possible opening moves. Although effective in winning for White (54.25%), it is not quite as successful as the four next most common openings for White: 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%).Chess Opening Explorer. Chessgames.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-27. Since nearly all openings beginning 1.e4 have names of their own, the term \\"King's Pawn Game\\", unlike Queen's Pawn Game, is rarely used to describe the opening of the game. Advancing the king's pawn two squares is highly useful because it occupies a square, attacks the center square d5, and allows the of White's and queen. Chess legend Bobby Fischer said that the King's Pawn Game is \\"Best by test\\", and proclaimed that \\"With 1.e4! I win.\\" King's Pawn Games are further classified by whether Black responds with 1...e5 or not. Openings beginning with 1.e4 e5 are called Double King's Pawn Games (or Openings), Symmetrical King's Pawn Games (or Openings), or Open Games - these terms are equivalent. Openings where Black responds to 1.e4 with a move other than 1...e5 are called Asymmetrical King's Pawn Games or Semi-Open Games. The Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (ECO) classifies all King's Pawn Games into volumes B or C: volume C if the game starts with 1.e4 e6 (the French Defence) or 1.e4 e5; volume B if Black answers 1.e4 with any other move. The rare instances where the opening does not fall into a more specific category than \\"King's Pawn Game\\" are included in codes B00 (includes the Nimzowitsch Defence and unusual moves after 1.e4), C20 (includes Alapin's Opening and unusual moves after 1.e4 e5), C40 (includes the Latvian Gambit and unusual moves after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3), and C50 (includes the Hungarian Defence, the Giuoco Pianissimo, and unusual moves after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4). Popular continuations The Black responses which are given one or more chapters in the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings () are given below, ranked in order of popularity according to ChessBase. *1... c5, the Sicilian Defence, is in modern practice the most common continuation. The Sicilian Defence allows Black to fight for the center by preparing to meet a d2‚Äìd4 advance with ...c5xd4. The Sicilian is among the sharpest and most analysed openings in chess, and it has eighty chapters, B20‚ÄìB99, set aside for it in ECO. *1... e5 leads to the classical Open Games, which includes openings like the Ruy Lopez, King's Gambit, Italian Game, Scotch Game and Petrov's Defence. Also in this opening, Black is ready to meet a d2‚Äìd4 advance with e5xd4. These openings are covered in chapters C20‚ÄìC99 in ECO. *1... e6 is the French Defence, covered in chapters C00‚ÄìC19 in ECO. Black's restrained response allows White to play 2.d4. This gives White a spatial advantage, with two pawns in the center to Black's one (after the usual 2... d5). One or the other player will usually resolve the center tension, either by Black playing ...dxe4 or White advancing with e5. In the latter case, Black typically works to undermine White's pawn center with ...c5 and/or ...f6. *1... c6 is the Caro‚ÄìKann Defence, covered in chapters B10‚ÄìB19 in ECO. Like the French, this is also considered to be a solid reply, but Black will often need to surrender control over the center (e.g., after 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Black usually plays 3...dxe4). On the other hand, the light-squared bishop will usually not wind up trapped behind its own pawns, as is common in the French. *1... d6 is usually played with the intention of playing the Pirc Defence (1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6, ECO codes B07‚ÄìB09), a hypermodern defence in which Black allows White to construct a dominant center, with the intention of subverting it later. It can also lead to the Modern Defence, Pribyl System or Philidor Defence. *1... g6 is the Modern Defence. This can lead to a related opening called the Pirc Defence (1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6). These openings allow White to build up a pawn center with 2.d4, but Black will develop the king's bishop to g7 and strike back at the center. These openings are covered in chapters B06‚ÄìB09 in ECO, with the Modern Defence covered in chapter B06. *1... Nf6 is the Alekhine Defence, which invites White to attack the knight with 2.e5. Black is often forced to spend time moving the knight several times as it is chased around the board, all the while allowing White to build up a broad pawn center. Black counts on the pawns becoming overextended so that he can later undermine them. The Alekhine is covered in chapters B02‚ÄìB05 of ECO. *1... d5, the Scandinavian Defence or Center Counter Defence, is a direct strike at the pawn at e4, forcing the situation in the center. After 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3, however, White gains time by attacking Black's prematurely developed queen. Alternatively, Black can play 2...Nf6 (the Marshall Gambit), when White chooses between 3.d4 Nxd5 4.c4 with a spatial advantage, or 3.c4, when Black usually offers a gambit with either 3...c6 or 3...e6. The Scandinavian is covered in chapter B01 in ECO. Uncommon continuations Apart from these eight responses, all other replies from Black are covered together in ECO chapter B00 (\\"Uncommon King's Pawn Opening\\"). A few of these are not entirely obscure, and have received extensive analysis. *1... Nc6 is the Nimzowitsch Defence. After 2.d4, there are two distinctive main lines: 2...e5, favoured by British grandmaster Tony Miles, and 2...d5, introduced and often played by the influential Latvian-Danish player and writer Aron Nimzowitsch (1886‚Äì1935). *1... b6 is Owen's Defence, preparing to develop Black's bishop to b7 to put pressure on White's center. *1... a6 is the St. George Defence. Black prepares to advance on the with 2...b5, but allows White to occupy the center with 2.d4. The opening gained some attention after Miles used it to defeat Anatoly Karpov in 1980.Karpov‚ÄìMiles, European Team Championship, Skara 1980 *1... g5 is the Borg Defence (\\"Grob\\" backwards) or Basman Defence, often played by IM Michael Basman. The move weakens the severely, but according to Modern Chess Openings (MCO), Black is only somewhat worse.Nick de Firmian, Modern Chess Openings, 15th edition, Random House, 2008, p. 384. . Rare continuations The remaining replies to 1.e4 are very rare, and have not received significant and serious attention by masters. MCO does not cover them, considering them so bad as not to merit discussion.\\"Other defenses, such as 1...h5, are not considered as they are simply too bad and need no discussion.\\" Modern Chess Openings, 15th edition, p. 384. These openings sometimes lead to wild and exciting games, and are occasionally employed by weaker players to get better trained opponents \\"out-of-book\\". Some have exotic names. Such openings are listed below along with instances where they have been used by strong players. * 1... h6, called the Carr Defence in Unorthodox Chess Openings. This defence has also been used by Michael Basman, and is likely to transpose to the Borg Defence after 2.d4 g5. * 1... a5, the Corn Stalk Defence. United States chess player Preston Ware played the Corn Stalk in eleven recorded tournament games from 1880 to 1882, winning four and losing seven. Its chief fault is the very early and therefore potentially unnecessary development of a peripheral piece. * 1... Na6, called the Lemming Defence in Unorthodox Chess Openings, develops the knight to an inferior square. * 1... h5, the Goldsmith Defence or Pickering Defence. All this move achieves is to waste a tempo and weaken the kingside. It is the reversed version of the Kadas Opening. * 1... f6 is known as the Barnes Defence after Thomas Wilson Barnes. This move is clearly inferior, taking away the f6-square from the knight and weakening Black's kingside, although Barnes managed to defeat Paul Morphy with this defence in 1858.Philip W. Sergeant, Morphy's Games of Chess, Dover Publications, 1957, pp. 238‚Äì40. Morphy‚ÄìBarnes, 1858 * 1... f5 is called the Duras Gambit in Unorthodox Chess Openings, and is also known as the Fred Defence. This is a pawn sacrifice which gives Black a lead in development after 2.exf5 Nf6, but without much additional compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Another move in this position is 2...Kf7, but after the move 3.Qh5+, Black has to play g6 and totally wreck his kingside. The line was played three times in an exhibition match between Ossip Bernstein and Old≈ôich Duras. * 1... Nh6, the Adams Defence or Wild Bull Defence. It can transpose to the old hippo system. * 1... b5 simply loses a pawn to 2.Bxb5.

It was released on August 13, 1991, through Warner Bros. Records. The album contains many genre shifts which are typical of the band, and helped increase the band's popularity, gaining them a cult following.  Content  The album cover features artwork by Dan Sweetman, originally published in the story, \\"A Cotton Candy Autopsy\\" in the DC Comics/Piranha Press imprint title Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children. The album mixes a variety of musical styles, including ska, circus music, heavy metal, free jazz, and funk. AllMusic called it a \\"dizzying, disconcerting, schizophrenic tour through just about any rock style the group can think of, hopping from genre to genre without any apparent rhyme or reason, and sometimes doing so several times in the same song.\\" The website described Mike Patton's lyrics as \\"even more bizarrely humorous than those he used in Faith No More\\", and \\"also less self- censored\\". At the time, the band's label Warner promoted the record as being Mike Patton's \\"seriously weird new project\\". Quotes from David Lynch's 1986 film Blue Velvet are strewn throughout the album.  Critical reception and legacy  The album received mixed reviews upon release. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a negative review, writing \\"Adjectives like 'puerile' and 'unlistenable' take on entirely new dimensions when applied to Mr. Bungle\\". Trouser Press called it \\"one of the most ambitiously random, fractious records in recent memory\\" and \\"one of the finest records of its kind\\". In 2015, Korn guitarist James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer praised the album, stating \\"I loved their last album, California, but their self-titled debut had the biggest impact on me. There‚Äôs a song on there called \\"Love Is a Fist\\" that's fucking crushing. That set the tone for us and what we went on to do creatively. They were completely outside the box and just didn't care ‚Äì they satisfied only themselves. It wasn't about record sales, it was just about creating a band.\\" Mike Portnoy, former drummer of progressive metal band Dream Theater named Mr. Bungle as one of his 10 favorite progressive rock albums of all time, as he wrote \\"This is one of my top 10 albums of all time, in any genre. It actually scared the shit out of me the first time I heard it. I literally had never heard anything that twisted and evil and joyful. It was just the most bizarre hour I had ever spent listening to music.\\" He also added that \\"It's a roller coaster sonic experience, and it's full of eclectic, diverse styles. I know every nuance of it inside and out. It's truly one of my desert island discs.\\" Synyster Gates, from the hard rock band Avenged Sevenfold, named the album as \\"one of the most incredible pieces of music [he] has ever heard in [his] life\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv3-bs7GWfc&t;=261s  Track listing  All songs written by Mr. Bungle.

SPC was acquired by ECS Federal, LLC in 2015. It is principal support contractor to cabinet-level departments, including the Department of Defense, Justice and State, and Homeland Security. History SPC had its direct predecessor Systems Planning and Research Corporation, headquartered in Maryland, which started its R&D; activities in the 1950s from development of the advanced range instrumentation systems for the U.S. Army missile ranges.Howard, William E. The Capital‚Äôs Top Private Industry, Missiles and Rockets, August 31, 1959, vol. 5, no. 36, p. 20. The conference room of SPC was also used for meetings of the Society for Operational Research, to which Viktor Vasilyevich Lozenko, a Soviet KGB officer under the cover of diplomat also belongs. In September 1980, Lozenko bugged the conference room and acquired highly important intelligence about the current and future deployment of US nuclear weapons in Europe, American chemical weapons, US navy's chances of survival in a nuclear conflict and US position on SAALT-2 talks and even Pentagon officials' classified report entitled Current Status and Trends in the Advancement of the US Nuclear Front in the Central European Theater of War in which US mobilization capabilities, the effectiveness of laser guidance systems, plans for the destruction of 730 tons of chemical weapons and other important information.

Berridale lies at 860 metres above sea level between the towns of Cooma and Jindabyne and 435 kilometres south of Sydney. Climate and geography Berridale features an oceanic climate (Cfb); climate data sourced from nearby Cooma Airport‚Äîat similar elevation and position to Berridale itself. Snow falls occasionally, but is generally light and often melts swiftly due to the westerly foehn winds. Berridale's climate is relatively dry as the town is located in a rainshadow on the Monaro; between the Snowy Mountains and the coastal plain. The land surrounding the town is a combination of cleared farmland and lightly-wooded bush. There are granite boulders located south through west of the town on the roads to both Jindabyne and Dalgety. This granite was crystallised as a large mass from magma 400 million years ago miles from the Earth's surface and was gradually eroded and uplifted to its current position. The hills immediately to the north of the town have less granite. There are, however, a few small areas of shale. History Aborigines long occupied the area but in small numbers. The European settlement was founded in the 1860s, when Scotsman William Oliver built his house there in 1863 and opened a roadside store, naming the location as a variation on his home town in Scotland, Berriedale. The dry climate later proved the town ideal for growing fine merino wool. Oliver's store became a wayside inn in 1870, which still exists as the Berridale Inn, and a granite store was built. A post office opened in the town in 1869 with a telegraph office opening in 1870. The town nicknamed itself the 'Crossroads of the Snowy' during the period when gold miners would pass through on their way to the Adaminaby and Kiandra goldfields. Berridale was also nicknamed the 'Town of the Poplars' in the 1990s due to the main road through it from Cooma to Jindabyne (Jindabyne Road/Kosciusko Road ) being lined by an avenue of poplars. The town grew slowly with the pastoral industry forming the mainstay of the local economy. The town hosted a work camp for the Snowy Mountains Authority although its population did not grow as much as Jindabyne or Cooma during the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Berridale is also home to one of the largest collections of heavy machinery and associated equipment salvaged from construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The items include dozers, graders, scrapers, dumpers, loaders, tournapulls, trucks, snow equipment and numerous other pieces, from well known makers such as International, Euclid, LeTourneau Westinghouse, Allis Chalmers, Caterpillar, Thornycroft, Leyland, and others and numbers in excess of 100 pieces. A museum is planned for future construction to display the items. In recent decades, Berridale has developed a tourism industry based on its location en route to the NSW snow fields. John Howard was staying in Berridale in September 1985 on a family ski holiday when Andrew Peacock announced that he would call a Party Room meeting to replace him as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. When Howard was re-elected as Deputy Leader on 5 September, Peacock was in an untenable position and resigned with Howard becoming leader of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,197 people in Berridale. 82.8% of people were born in Australia and 91.5% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 34.0%, Anglican 23.1% and Catholic 22.5%. Education Berridale Public School is a primary school with around 100 pupils, serving the town and the outlying areas, with pupils going on to the Snowy Mountains Grammar School or Jindabyne Central School in Jindabyne or Monaro High School in Cooma. Local Attractions Berridale Inn is a tourist hot spot when traveling through to the snow during season. With its moonlike landscape, Berridale is a haven for photographers during each season. Many photographers utilise the granite boulders for shots whilst many will also take advantage of the Poplar trees that line the highway when they change from bright green to a luminous yellow during autumn. During the year the Lions Club hold the Easter and Spring markets which draw a large crowd to the township. The Berridale Chamber of Commerce also holds a Christmas Twilight Market which proves to be very popular. The Heritage Walk is also popular with tourists and residents. The walk features many of the older parts of the town. Berridale also plays host to being a checkpoint during The Snowy Ride. The Snowy Ride is a motorcycle event run annually in the Alpine Region of NSW with the aim of involving motorcycle riders from all over Australia to raise money for Childhood Cancer Research. During Winter, Berridale's population swells as skiers and seasonal workers converge on the town as they make it their base for the winter ski season. Sport Berridale has tennis court facilities, four of which are all weather and two clay and are used weekly during the warmer months. Berridale also competes in the Monaro and District Cricket Association fielding one side in the competition and have won several competitions in the past. The Berridale swimming pool is open from November until March. Golf is played at the Coolamatong Golf Club which is located around 2 km from the CBD. The course is 18 holes and features grass greens and is also used for the Diggers Golf Day held in May each year. The club house is located in the CBD. Berridale is also used as a training base for cyclists from all over Australia who use the many roads to train on as well as taking advantage of the high altitude. World War 2 aircraft crash On 28 March 1942, a USAAF P-40E fighter made an emergency landing at \\"Wheat Hill\\" station, after becoming lost in fog during a flight from Canberra. The pilot, Lt Chester Namola stayed overnight with the headmaster of the local public school.
