He was secretary-treasurer of the Teamsters from 1985 to 1991. After Teamsters president Jackie Presser took a leave of absence for health reasons, Mathis was interim president from May 5, 1988 - July 18, 1988. He was defeated for the presidency in an executive council vote, and served out the rest of his term as secretary-treasurer before retiring. Early career Weldon Mathis was born in Sylvester, Georgia in 1926. He served in the United States Army in World War II. Mathis joined the Teamsters in 1946. Mathis' Teamster career began when he was elected business agent for Local 728 in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1950. He was elected the local's secretary-treasurer in 1953 and its president in 1956. He remained the local's president, even though he held additional national offices as well, until 1976. In 1957 he was hired by the Teamsters' Southern Conference to be an organizer. He left that post in 1967 when he was hired as an organizer for the international union. Mathis was appointed a vice president of the international union in 1972 to fill an empty seat. He was elected 1976 and re-elected in 1981. In 1967, president Frank Fitzsimmons appointed Mathis as his executive assistant. In 1978, Fitzsimmons appointed him director of the union's Building Material and Construction Department. Secretary-treasurer In 1985, Mathis was elected secretary- treasurer of the Teamsters. In 1986, Presser won an amendment to the Teamsters' constitution so that the secretary-treasurer rather than the First Vice President would become interim president. Presser secretly consulted the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Mathis before making him secretary- treasurer. The FBI said he was not involved with organized crime. Ten days after he was named interim president, Mathis resigned as president of Local 728. The United States Department of Labor was investigating him at the time due to allegations of vote fraud in his last re-election bid. Interim president When Teamster president Jackie Presser was diagnosed with cancer and took a four-month leave of absence on May 5, 1988, Mathis was named interim president. Presser was subsequently diagnosed with brain cancer, setting off a power struggle within the union. The members of the union's freight and warehouse and its air freight divisions voted overwhelmingly against their respective three-year national contracts after Mathis took over. But Mathis declared each contract \\"ratified\\" because the \\"no\\" vote fell short of the two-thirds needed to reject a contract and authorize a strike. The contract votes weakened Mathis' support on the union's executive board because Mathis was the highest-ranking official involved in the talks. Mathis's support among the union's leadership was never strong. Mathis was considered much more liberal Presser or the rest of the Teamsters' leadership at the time, and he was much more in favor of participating fully in AFL-CIO. Mathis was challenged by a faction of conservative Teamsters led by Joseph Trerotola, the union's First Vice President. Trerotola was deeply angered by the 1986 constitutional amendment which allowed Mathis to assume the presidency, and he began building a coalition to oust him. When Mathis called a meeting in Arizona (where Presser was being treated), Trerotola refused to attend. Initially, possible challengers included Joseph W. Morgan (who had sought to become interim president after Roy Lee Williams' resignation in 1983, Walter Shea (director of the Eastern Conference of Teamsters in Washington, D.C.), Donald Peters (a Teamster leader in Chicago), and Arnie Weinmeister (a Teamster official in Washington state and protégé of former interim president George Mock). Mathis suffered another blow to his candidacy on June 28, 1988, when federal officials filed suit in federal court to impose a trusteeship on the Teamsters union.. Presser died on July 9, 1988, triggering an election for a new president. But at an executive board meeting on July 18, 1988, Mathis was unseated as president in favor of William J. McCarthy, president of the New England Conference of Teamsters. McCarthy, a protégé of Jimmy Hoffa, emerged as a candidate days before the vote. He was seen as a much more aggressive leader than Mathis. McCarthy—who led the opposition to the freight and warehouse contract—promised to fight the government's trusteeship suit, adopt a more confrontational collective bargaining posture, end the union's thaw toward the rest of the AFL-CIO, and endorse a George H.W. Bush in the 1988 presidential election. Peters, Shea and Weinmeister pulled out of the running, throwing their support behind McCarthy. After a bitter, rancorous, two-and-a-half-hour board meeting, the board voted 9-to-8 to select McCarthy as the union's new president. Vice president Daniel Ligurotis of Chicago cast the deciding vote. Post-presidency In late December 1988, the federal government sued to overturn Mathis' 1987 election as president of Local 728. In March 1989, Mathis signed an agreement with the Department of Justice. He consented to aggressively seek internal reforms in the union in exchange for being dropped from the government's labor racketeering suit. The Teamsters reached an agreement with the Justice Department on March 12, 1989, in which the union agreed to institute internal reforms in order to end corruption and improve the democratic nature of its elections. Mathis was chosen by the executive board in 1990 to run for re-election as part of an incumbent slate. President McCarthy declined to run for health reasons, and the board selected R.V. Durham, an international vice president, to run as their candidate for president. In February 1991, Mathis backed a decision by Durham to reject a McCarthy-backed candidate for an empty vice presidential seat. The move was seen as an attempt to put political distance between the Durham candidacy and the McCarthy administration, which was increasingly unpopular with Teamster members. In retaliation, the board sued McCarthy and Mathis for labor racketeering. A week later, on February 8, 1991, Mathis recommended that the Teamster executive council look into the bidding process McCarthy used to award his son-in-law a contract to print the union magazine. Mathis' move was widely seen as a possible \\"coup attempt\\": If McCarthy were found to have committed improper acts, he would be forced to resign—allowing Mathis to become president of the union as well as be seen as a reformer. But the Teamster general board deadlocked 7—7 over the issue, and no investigation was made. On April 10, 1991, Mathis withdrew from the race for the secretary- treasurer position. Durham replaced him with Walter Shea. Shea attempted to oust McCarthy in June 1991, once more charging that McCarthy should step down immediately over the contract awarded to his son-in-law. A court-appointed administrator of the Teamsters had ruled that McCarthy had improperly awarded the printing contract but did not seek charges against him. A federal district court judge agreed with that decision. McCarthy turned the meeting of the Teamster executive board over to Mathis, who subsequently ruled that no vote could be taken until after the Teamster convention. Mathis retired from his post as secretary-treasurer on October 31, 1991, two months early. Mathis and his wife, the former Myrtle Henson, had five children. Two of Mathis's sons, who controlled Local 728, were voted out of office in a federally monitored election. Rather than return to Georgia, Mathis retired to Florida. Weldon Mathis died of cancer on October 20, 2001, in Ormond Beach, Florida. References *Ball, Karen. \\"Teamsters Official Recommends Probe of Printing Contract.\\" Associated Press.

The American Conservatory  After the war, Walter Damrosch and Francis Casadesus decided to continue this successful operation. With the full support of French authorities, as well as that of composer and organist Charles-Marie Widor (who became its first director), the American Conservatory—as it was called—was granted permission to open in the Louis XV wing of the Chateau of Fontainebleau. The American Conservatory (Conservatoire américain de Fontainebleau) intended to offer the best of French musical education to young, promising musicians. Since 1921, the teaching staff has included renowned faculty such as: the trio Pasquier, Maurice Ravel, Camille Saint-Saëns, Marcel Dupré, Robert and Gaby Casadesus, Charles-Marie Widor, Henri Dutilleux, Gilbert Amy, Betsy Jolas, André Boucourechliev, Pierre Amoyal, Sviatoslav Richter, Mstislav Rostropovitch, Igor Stravinsky, Arthur Rubinstein, Tristan Murail and Leonard Bernstein. Nadia Boulanger, a young composition/harmony professor, was among this distinguished faculty from the beginning. Her energy, knowledge, and her spirit guided the school until 1979. Her close friend Isidor Philipp headed the piano departments of both the Paris Conservatory and the American Conservatory. His renown in the US helped bring many American composers. The current director presiding over the school is Philippe Entremont. Under such renowned guidance, the American Conservatory influenced many of the best American musicians such as: Aaron Copland, Roy Harris, Virgil Thomson, Louise Talma, Samuel Dushkin, Elliott Carter, Beveridge Webster, Kenton Coe, Kenneth Lampl, and many others.

People claiming to be supercentenarians, or their family members, are required to supply documents that prove the claimant's birth date, change of name (if applicable), and date of death (if applicable), along with another piece of official government identification. Researchers from the GRG verify that these documents are true and correct and if they are, the claimant is included in the GRG's official tables of supercentenarians. The GRG also conducts research on aging by interviewing willing supercentenarians and collecting their blood and DNA samples.

The murders took place between July 1941 and August 1944 near the railway station at Ponary (now Paneriai), a suburb of today's Vilnius, Lithuania. Some 70,000 Jews were murdered at Ponary, along with up to 20,000 Poles, and 8,000 Russian POWs, most of them from nearby Vilna (Vilnius), and its newly-formed Vilna Ghetto.Kazimierz Sakowicz, Yitzhak Arad, Ponary Diary, 1941–1943: A Bystander's Account of a Mass Murder, Yale University Press, 2005, , Google Print. Lithuania and the Baltic States became one of the first locations outside occupied Poland in World War II where the Nazis would mass murder Jews as part of the Final Solution. Out of 70,000 Jews living in Vilna according to Snyder, only 7,000 (or 10 percent) survived the war. The number of dwellers, estimated by Sedlis, as of June 1941 was 80,000 Jews, or one-half of the city's population. According to the Holocaust Encyclopedia and others, more than two-thirds of them or at least 50,000 Jews had been killed before the end of 1941. Also in: Background Following the Żeligowski's Mutiny and the creation of the short-lived Central Lithuania, in accordance with international agreements ratified in 1923 by the League of Nations, the town of Ponary became part of the Wilno Voivodship (Kresy region) of the Second Polish Republic. The predominant languages in the area were Polish and Yiddish. After the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, the region was annexed by the Soviets and after about a month, on October 10, transferred to Lithuania according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Treaty. Following the Soviet annexation of Lithuania and the Baltic states in June 1940, the construction of an oil storage facility began near Ponary in conjunction with the future Soviet military airfield. That project was never completed, and in June 1941 the area was overrun by the Wehrmacht in Operation Barbarossa. The Nazi killing squads decided to use the six large pits excavated for the oil storage tanks to abduct, murder, and to hide the bodies of condemned locals.Vilnius Yiddish Institute (2009), . As well as, . Massacres Ponary massacre site on the map of the Holocaust in Poland (top right corner, near Wilno), marked with a white skull The massacres began in July 1941, as soon as SS Einsatzkommando 9 arrived in Vilna on 2 July 1941. Most of the actual killings were carried out by the Special Platoons of Ypatingasis burys (Lithuanian volunteers) 80 men strong. On 9 August 1941, EK 9 was replaced by EK 3. In September, the Vilna Ghetto was established. In the same month 3,700 Jews were shot in one operation, and 6,000 in another, rounded up in the city and walked to Paneriai. Most victims were stripped before being shot. Further mass killings, aided by Ypatingasis burys, took place throughout the summer and fall. By the end of the year, about 50,000–60,000 Vilna Jews; men, women, and children, had been killed according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia. According to Snyder 21,700 of them were shot at Ponary, but there are serious discrepancies in the death toll for this period. Yitzhak Arad (Ghetto In Flames) supplied information based on original Jewish documentation augmented by the Einsatzgruppen reports, ration cards and work permits. According to his estimates, until the end of December, 33,500 Jews of Vilna were murdered in Ponary, 3,500 fled east, and 20,000 remained in the Ghetto.[p. 215] The reason for such a wide range of estimated deaths was the presence of war refugees arriving from German-occupied western Poland, whose residence rights were denied by the new Lithuanian administration. On the eve of the Soviet annexation of Lithuania in June 1940, Vilna was home to around 100,000 newcomers, including 85,000 Poles, and 10,000 Jews according to Lithuanian Red Cross. The pace of killings slowed in 1942, as ghettoised Jewish slave-workers were appropriated by the Wehrmacht. As Soviet troops advanced in 1943, the Nazi units tried to cover up the crime under the Aktion 1005 directive. Eighty inmates from the Stutthof concentration camp were formed into Leichenkommando (\\"corpse units\\"). The workers were forced to dig up bodies, pile them on wood and burn them. The ashes were then ground up, mixed with sand and buried. After months of this gruesome work, the brigade managed to escape through a tunnel dug with spoons on 19 April 1944. Eleven of the 80 who escaped survived the war; their testimony contributed to revealing the massacre. Testimony of Y. Farber, a witness and participant of the event, as recorded by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg in ″The Black Book: The Ruthless Murder of Jews by German-Fascist Invaders Throughout the Temporarily-Occupied Regions of the Soviet Union and in the Death Camps of Poland during the War 1941–1945.″ ()NY Times, Escape Tunnel Dug by Hand Is Found at Holocaust Massacre Site, By NICHOLAS ST. FLEUR, JUNE 29, 2016 Victims Executed victims of the massacre The total number of victims by the end of 1944 was between 70,000 and 100,000. According to post-war exhumation by the forces of Soviet 2nd Belorussian Front the majority (50,000–70,000) of the victims were Polish and Lithuanian Jews from nearby Polish and Lithuanian cities, while the rest were primarily Poles (about 20,000) and Russians (about 8,000). According to Monika Tomkiewicz, author of a 2008 book on the Ponary massacre, 80,000 people were killed, including 72,000 Jews, 5,000 Soviet prisoners, between 1,500 and 2,000 Poles, 1,000 people described as Communists or Soviet activists, and 40 Romani people.Andrzej Kaczyński, Zbrodnia ponarska w świetle dokumentów , wyborcza.pl, 17 June 2009; accessed 8 December 2014. The Polish victims were mostly members of Polish intelligentsia – academics, educators (such as Kazimierz Pelczar, a professor of Stefan Batory University), priests (such as Father Romuald Świrkowski), and members of the Armia Krajowa resistance movement. Among the first victims were approximately 7,500 Soviet POWs shot in 1941 soon after Operation Barbarossa begun.Ponary. Last accessed on 10 February 2007. At later stages there were also smaller numbers of victims of other nationalities, including local Russians, Romani and Lithuanians, particularly Communist sympathizers (Liudas Adomauskas, Valerijonas Knyva, Andrius ir Aleksandra Bulotos) and over 80 soldiers of General Povilas Plechavičius' Local Lithuanian Detachment who refused to follow German orders. Commemoration Information about the massacre began to spread as early as 1943, due to the activities and works of Helena Pasierbska, Józef Mackiewicz, Kazimierz Sakowicz and others. Nonetheless the Soviet regime, which supported the resettlement of Poles from the Kresy, found it convenient to deny that Poles or Jews were singled out for massacre in Paneriai; the official line was that Paneriai was a site of massacre of Soviet citizens only.Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Lithuania at Ponary (with photo gallery); accessed 15 March 2007. This led some — including Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek — to compare this to the Katyn massacre. On 22 October 2000, a decade after the fall of communism, in independent Lithuania, an effort by several Polish organizations resulted in raising a monument (a cross) to fallen Polish citizens, during an official ceremony in which representatives of both Polish and Lithuanian governments (Bronisław Komorowski, Polish Minister of Defence, and his Lithuanian counterpart), as well as several NGOs, took place.. Message from the Polish-Lithuanian Memorial Ceremony in Panerai, 2000. On the pages of Polish Bar Association. The site of the massacre is commemorated by a monument to the victims of the Holocaust (erected in 1991), a memorial to the Polish victims (erected in 1990, reconstructed in 2000), monument to soldiers of Lithuanian Local Squad killed by Nazis in May, 1944 (erected in 2004), memorial stone to Soviet war prisoners, starved to death and shot here in 1941 (erected in 1996) and a small museum (currently Paneriai memorial information center).

A witness to the prolonged Ponary massacre, he chronicled much of it in his diary, published in English as Ponary Diary, which became one of the best known testaments to that atrocity of the Second World War, in which about 100 000 Jews, Poles and Russians were murdered by Germans and Lithuanian collaborators. An editor of Przegląd Gospodarczy (Economic Review) journal in Wilno, Sakowicz moved to the Ponary district during the German occupation and chronicled events from July 11, 1941, to October 25, 1943. He was an officer of the pre-war Polish army, and a member of the Polish resistance. On 5th July 1944, while cycling to Wilno, possibly in relation to nationwide uprising against the Nazis, Operation Tempest, he was machine-gunned and seriously wounded by the Lithuanians. Found in the evening by his neighbours in a ditch and brought to St. Jacob Hospital in Wilno, he died ten days later. His grave is located in the Rossa Cemetery in Vilnius, among graves of the fallen soldiers of the Polish underground (Armia Krajowa).

The Jesuit Mission Press published it at Nagasaki along with other early Japanese language reference works, such as the 1603 Nippo Jisho Japanese–Portuguese dictionary. The Rakuyōshū, also known as the Rakuyoshu or Rakuyôshû, is notable as the first dictionary to separate kanji readings between Chinese loanword on (音 \\"pronunciation\\") and native Japanese kun (訓 \\"meaning\\"). In contrast with the numerous Rakuyōshū studies written in Japanese, the primary research in English is by Joseph Koshimi Yamagiwa (1955), Professor of Japanese at the University of Michigan, and Don Clifford Bailey (1960, 1962), Professor of Japanese at the University of Arizona. Title Although the title Rakuyōshū (落葉集) literally reads as a shū (集 \\"collection; assembly\\") of rakuyō (落葉 \\"fallen leaves\\", or ochiba 落ち葉 in kun reading), the preface explains it metaphorically means \\"collection, in iroha order, of fallen (left-over, overlooked) words\\". > To be sure, many Japanese dictionaries have appeared in the world before > now. Of these, however, it may be said that they are deficient either in > that they provide the koe [Chinese reading] of characters, omitting the yomi > [Japanese reading], or that they record the yomi and ignore the koe. Herein > we propose to assemble \\"left-over [rakusaku]\\" kanji and compounds long in > use but hitherto overlooked and to arrange them, after the manner of the > Irohashu, in iroha order, their on [Chinese readings] to be on the right and > their yomi to be on the left, and thus to produce in one volume a dictionary > to be designated the Rakuyōshū. Thereafter we propose to add a section of > characters and compounds similarly grouped in iroha order but arranged in > terms of their Japanese readings. (tr. Bailey 1960:297) Rakusaku comes from the Classical Chinese word luosuo (落索 \\"wither, shrivel; fall low, fall on hard times; lonely, lonesome\\"). Thus, the title blends raku (落 \\"fall; drop\\") meaning words \\"dropped\\" (overlooked, missed) by other Japanese dictionaries plus yōshū (葉集, or hashū in on-reading) abbreviating Irohashū (色葉集 \\"iroha collection\\") meaning a dictionary collated in iroha order (e.g., the 12th-century Iroha Jiruishō). Despite the compiler's intention of including overlooked words, Bailey discovered that more than half of the Rakuyōshū entries are found in contemporary Japanese dictionaries, primarily 15th-century Setsuyōshū editions, and many others occur in Chinese rime dictionaries. Contents The Rakuyōshū text comprises 108 folios (chō 丁 \\"leaf of paper, folio; block\\") in three parts, succinctly described by Joseph Koshimi Yamagiwa. > (1) A 62-folio section consisting of (a) the Rakuyōshū proper, which is a > listing of Chinese-Japanese characters (kanji 漢字) and compounds arranged in > terms of their on 音pronunciation, that is, the pronunciations borrowed into > Japanese from Chinese, (b) a list of the characters used in writing the > numbers, and (c) some errata; > (2) a 27-folio section consisting of (a) the \\"Irohajishū 色葉字集,\\" which is a > listing of kanji and compounds arranged in terms of their kun 訓 > pronunciations, that is, the pronunciations of the Japanese words > represented by the Chinese characters, (b) some errata, (c) a listing of the > names of one hundred Japanese government offices together with their Chinese > equivalents, and (d) a listing of the sixty-odd provinces of Japan; and > (3) a 19-folio section consisting of (a) the \\"Shōgyokuhen 小玉篇,\\" which is a > listing of kanji in terms of 105 \\"radicals,\\" and (b) some errata. > (1955:75–6) Part (I), entitled the Rakuyōshū, gives Chinese on readings of kanji and kanji compounds. It includes nearly 1,700 main character entries (boji 母字 \\"mother character; head character\\") with approximately 12,000 run-on entries of multi- character compounds (jukuji 熟字 \\"compound; idiom; phrase\\"). Part (2), the Irohajishū (\\"Iroha-ordered character collection\\"), gives the equivalent Japanese kun readings of kanji. It is less than half the size of (1) and only gives about one-fourth as many kanji compounds, around 3,000. The Irohajishū frequently lists graphic variants that have homophonous kun readings, for instance, defining hō 芳 \\"fragrance; aroma\\", fun 芬 \\"sweet smell; fragrance; perfume\\", and kō 香 \\"scent; aroma; fragrance; incense\\" as Japanese kōbashii \\"nice-smelling; savory; aromatic; fragrant; favorable\\". This part includes two appendices: the Hyakkan narabi ni Tōmyō no taigai (百官並唐名之大概 \\"Outline of the hundred government offices and their Chinese equivalents\\") and the Nippon Rakujūyoshū (日本六十餘州 \\"The 60-odd provinces of Japan\\") gazetteer. Part (3), the Shōgokuhen (小玉篇 \\"Little Yupian\\"), classifies 2,366 characters, mostly from Parts (1) and (2), according to 105 (bushu 部首) \\"radicals\\" and gives their respective on and kun readings. The title and format follow the circa 543 CE Chinese Yupian (\\"Jade Chapters\\") dictionary, in analogy to the circa 1489 Wagokuhen (\\"Japanese Yupian\\"). The Shōgokuhen begins with an index that semantically classifies the radicals under 12 headings (mon 門 \\"gates\\") of tenmon (天文 \\"natural phenomena\\"), chiri (地理 \\"geographical features\\"), jinbutsu (人物 \\"human matters\\"), etc., and gives the radical numbers within the main text. Unlike previous Japanese dictionaries, this index also gives a common name for each radical. Another feature useful to students of Japanese kanji was cross-listing some characters under more than one component radicals (kō or suki 好 \\"like; love\\" can be listed under the \\"woman radical\\" 女 and the \\"child radical\\" 子). Textual arrangement Rakuyōshū Parts (1) and (2) are called the honpen (本編 \\"main text\\") and (3) is the kōhen (後編 \\"later text\\"). The main text is dated 1598 and the undated Shōgokuhen probably was published circa 1599. One of the most significant lexicographical improvements in the Rakuyōshū is separately listing the on and kun readings of kanji. Contemporary Sengoku period Japanese dictionaries like the Setsuyōshū listed characters by one or the other, or mixed them. Bailey (1962:214) believes the reason was because the Rakuyōshū was designed for Europeans who could not easily distinguish between on and kun readings. This dictionary's internal arrangement combines the main text giving on and kun readings for kanji according to iroha order with the later index giving readings arranged by graphic radicals. Dictionary users who know either the Japanese or Chinese reading of a character can locate it in the main text, and those who cannot ascertain a character's reading can find it through the radical index. Unlike the Nippo Jisho, this dictionary does not use rōmaji to romanize Japanese pronunciation, other than the title page spelling Racuyoxu. This unique Jesuit romanization system was based on Portuguese and differs from the usual Hepburn romanization. The Japanese historical linguist Morita Takeshi (森田武) discovered that many Rakuyōshū character entries and almost half of the compound entries are alphabetized in the Jesuit system; most consistently after the 12th kana wo を. Bailey summarizes that > the arrangement of compounds in the main text of the Rakuyōshū is primarily > alphabetic, but inconsistent to the extent that words of related meanings > are often grouped together, especially in the early portions or the honpen. > In addition, there are a few places where entries are listed in apparently > arbitrary order, neither alphabetic nor semantic arrangement obtaining. > (1960:323) Historical aspects Japanese Kirishitan ban (キリシタン版 \\"Christian publications\\") refers to the books, grammars, and dictionaries published 1591–1611 by the Jesuit Mission Press (see Satow 1888). In 1590, the Italian Jesuit missionary Alessandro Valignano brought a movable type printing press to Japan. Compared with contemporary woodblock printing in Japan, Üçerler (2005) calls this technological superiority the \\"First IT Revolution\\". The Rakuyōshū is printed in kanji characters and hiragana syllabary. The kanji font resembles handwritten semi-cursive script more than printed Japanese regular script. The hiragana font includes some outdated hentaigana forms. In the history of Japanese printing, the Rakuyōshū was the first movable-type dictionary to incorporate two kana innovations that were already used in handwritten Japanese, and have survived to this day. Furigana is printing smaller kana alongside a kanji to indicate the pronunciation, a practice which allows less-educated people to read Chinese characters. Handakuten (半濁点) is printing a small circle to the upper right of a kana to indicate voiceless bilabial stops, for example, compare voiced ha, hi, hu (は, ひ, ふ) with voiceless pa, pi, pu (ぱ, ぴ, ぷ). Most of the original Rakuyōshū copies were lost. Today, only four complete copies, two incomplete copies and two collections of fragments are known. Two complete copies were survived during the turbulent feudal period of Japanese history: one is now held by the Tenri Central Library, in Tenri, Nara, and the other is held by the British Library through Ernest Satow who bought this copy from antique dealer in Edo. Other two complete copies are preserved in Europe, by the Earl of Balcarres, and the Society of Jesus in Rome. Two Rakuyūshū copies missing Part (3) are owned by the Leiden University Library and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. Two collections of fragments are held by the Tenri Central Library, Bibliothèque Nationale of France, respectively. Conclusion \\"The Rakuyōshū, being a product of the Jesuit Mission Press and the Jesuits' views on the treatment of kanji and kana,\\" concludes Bailey (1962:263), \\"possesses a rigid yet comprehensive format making it somewhat a milestone in dictionary compilation in Japan.\\" He lists six of this dictionary's aspects that enhanced its usefulness four centuries ago and make it of interest today: #Its reproduction of kanji not in the square or printed style but in a form resembling longhand. #Its attempt to use phonetic rather than historical kana spellings of Japanese words. #Its use of alphabetization as a major sorting device in the listing of entries in the main text. #Its semantic classification of radicals in the index of the \\"Shōgokuhen.\\" #Its listing of kanji under more than one radical in the \\"Shōgokuhen.\\" #Its fairly consistent use, in kana spellings, of small circles (han-dakuten) to distinguish words pronounced with a voiceless bilabial stop.

There, he initially worked in press relations at CBS and subsequently, in 1953, wrote his first scripts for the NBC television sitcom The Aldrich Family.Writers Guild of America, Members Directory, \\"Bast, William\\", p. 62, Writers Guild of America, 1998. Writing about James Dean After the death of Dean in an automobile accident in September 1955, Bast chronicled his five-year relationship with the actor in James Dean: a Biography.Bast, William,James Dean: a Biography, New York: Ballantine Books, 1956Riese, R. The Unabridged James Dean: His Life and Legacy from A to Z, \\"William Bast\\", pp. 40-42, Chicago, Illinois: Contemporary Books, 1991 After moving to London, Bast wrote The Myth MakersThe Myth Makers by William Bast, in Six Granada Plays, London: Faber and Faber, ND for Granada Television, a fictionalized drama inspired by Dean's funeral, which Bast perceived as grotesque and publicity-driven, with a shattering effect on Dean's rural-American family and his hometown of Fairmount, Indiana. In the United States, the script was produced again by NBC's Dupont Show of the Month and aired under the title The Movie Star. In 1975, Bast produced and scripted James Dean: Portrait of a Friend for NBC, a movie for television based upon his first biography of James Dean. In 2006, Barricade Books (USA) published Surviving James Dean,Bast, William,Surviving James Dean, New York: Barricade Books, 2006, a second, more candid book by Bast about his relationship with Dean; which featured material that Bast did not include in his earlier account due to personal trepidations and social mores of the 1950s. In Surviving James Dean, Bast describes Dean in a compassionate light; how they met at UCLA, shared an apartment in Santa Monica, dated the same woman, and had a sexual relationship. He also describes the events that happened to him after Dean's death, largely as a result of having written his first book. Television work In the late 1950s, Bast adapted Jean Giraudoux's play Tiger at the Gates for Granada Television, and wrote scripts for the BBC and ITV. Back in the States he wrote episodes for Combat!, Perry Mason, Ben Casey, The Outer Limits, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Honey West, and Dr. Kildare, among other series.Who's Who in Entertainment, \\"William Edwin Bast\\", p.38. In 1976, he received the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allan Poe Award for his television movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden with Elizabeth Montgomery in the title role. In 1977, his adaptation of Alexandre Dumas, père's The Man in the Iron Mask, starring Richard Chamberlain in a dual role, received two Emmy nominations for Bast's script and Olga Lehmann's costume designs. His script for The Scarlet Pimpernel with Anthony Andrews and Sir Ian McKellen was honored with a Christopher Award in 1982, and his The First Modern Olympics won the Writers Guild of America Outstanding Script for Television Longform Series for 1984. From 1985 through 1987 Bast wrote and produced The Colbys, a spin-off from the popular series Dynasty, with his partner Paul Huson; The Colbys won the 1986 People's Choice Award. He also collaborated with Huson, writing and producing a variety of television movies and series, including Tucker's Witch, The Hamptons, Pursuit, The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake, Deadly Invasion: The Killer Bee Nightmare, Power and Beauty, and The Fury Within.

Political and military events in Scotland during the reign of David I are the events which took place in Scotland during David I of Scotland's reign as King of Scots, from 1124 to 1153. When his brother Alexander I of Scotland died in 1124, David chose, with the backing of Henry I of England, to take the Kingdom of Alba for himself. David was forced to engage in warfare against his rival and nephew, Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair. Subduing the latter took David ten years, and involved the destruction of Óengus, mormaer of Moray. David's victory allowed him to expand his control over more distant regions theoretically part of the Kingdom. In this he was largely successful, although he failed to bring the Earldom of Orkney into his kingdom. Overview Both Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray David as having little initial connection with the culture and society of the Scots;Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 79; Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 75–6. Oram characterises David's position at his accession in 1124 as \\"a stranger in a strange land\\".Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, title to chapter 5, pp. 73–88. Both historians likewise argue that David became increasingly re- Gaelicized in the later stages of his reign.Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 83; Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, esp. for instance, pp. 96, 126. Other historians, such as R. Andrew McDonald for instance, focus on the violence of David's \\"Norman\\" establishment, and partially explain David's troubles in Scotland as non-Celtic tension against the \\"Celtic\\" periphery.R. Andrew McDonald, Outlaws of Medieval Scotland, pp. 24–29, et passim. The latter Norman-Celtic dualistic picture is attacked by Matthew Hammond, who asks why the Gaelic east of the kingdom which constituted David's Scotian heartland was less \\"Celtic\\" than the heavily Norse-influenced west and north.Matthew H. Hammond, \\"Ethnicity and the Writing of Medieval Scottish history\\", p. 23. In fact, as king of Scots David pursued the goals anyone in his position would be expected to pursue. While it is true that David established himself in power with the backing of Henry I and his own Anglo- Norman retainers, as king his expansion also impinged upon areas that were Norse and English in speech using forces taken from his own Gaelic territories. David used the forces at his disposal. In doing so David's position in Scotland was largely successful. Not only did he survive to die a peaceful death, but he retained hold of his core territory in east-central Scotland, introduced more direct royal control into Moray and beyond, while men from Argyll, the Hebrides and Galloway were could be brought into David's 1136-8 invasion host. David's failings were that he did not succeed in permanently incorporating the Orkney Islands into his kingdom.For all this, see below. David's position as heir to Scottish throne However, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was spurious. David was the youngest of eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad II, and Máel Coluim, son of the last king Alexander, both preceded David in terms of the slowly emerging principles of primogeniture. However, unlike David, neither William nor Máel Coluim had the support of Henry, and both were claimed to be illegitimate. The death in 1122 of Sibylla, daughter of King Henry and wife of King Alexander, increased David's prospects of becoming King, which in turn made David even more important to Henry; it was probably for this reason that King Henry strengthened his military presence in the north of England at this point in time. This act was probably designed to make Alexander acknowledge David as heir, or at least to intimidate Alexander's vassals for this same purpose. So when Alexander died in 1124, the Gaelic aristocracy of Scotland had no choice but to accept David as King, or face war with both David and Henry I.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 70–2. 1st war against Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair Alexander's son Máel Coluim chose war. Orderic Vitalis reports that Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair \\"affected to snatch the kingdom from [David], and fought against him two sufficiently fierce battles; but David, who was loftier in understanding and in power and wealth, conquered him and his followers\\".A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 158. The revolt may have involved the death of David's eldest son. Before recounting the war against Máel Coluim, Orderic Vitalis reported the death of this son at the hands of an exiled Norwegian priest; but Orderic's account is so obscure that it is difficult to make anything of it. The priest was reportedly a member of David's household, and was put to death by being bound to the tails of four horses.A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 157; Duncan, The Kingship of the Scots, p 59, doubts the existence of this son on the basis that David is not known to have commemorated this supposed child, as he did to his other dead relatives. Whether or not the two events were connected, Máel Coluim escaped unharmed into areas of Scotland not yet under David's control, and there gained shelter and some measure of support; when Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair renewed his claim to the throne six years later, he had the support and protection of the king of Moray.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 84–5. Royal coronation and the Scots This illustration from a late medieval MS of Walter Bower's Scotichronicon depicts the royal inauguration of David's great-great grandson Alexander III of Scotland, Scone, 1249. Scone was the ancient royal centre and coronation site of Scotland's kings. Alexander is being greeted by the ollamh rígh, the royal poet, who is addressing him with the proclamation \\"Benach De Re Albanne\\" (= Beannachd Dé Rígh Alban, \\"God Bless the King of Scotland\\"); the poet goes on to recite Alexander's genealogy. David would have experienced a similar inauguration. In either April or May of the same year David was crowned King of Scots (Gaelic: rí(gh) Alban; Latin: rex Scottorum) at Scone. If later Scottish and Irish evidence can be taken as evidence, the ceremony of coronation was a series of elaborate traditional rituals,John Bannerman, \\"The Kings Poet\\", in The Scottish Historical Review, V. LXVIII, (1989), pp. 120–49. of the kind infamous in the Anglo-French world of the 12th century for their \\"unchristian\\" elements.John J. O'Meara (ed.), Gerald of Wales: The History and Topography of Ireland, (London, 1951), p. 110. Ailred of Rievaulx, friend and one time member of David's court, reported that David \\"so abhorred those acts of homage which are offered by the Scottish nation in the manner of their fathers upon the recent promotion of their kings, that he was with difficulty compelled by the bishops to receive them\\".A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 232. Whatever David thought of his childhood homeland, the Anglo-Norman historians were clearly convinced that he had little cultural or social connection to it in 1124. David remained an absentee king for much of his early reign in Scotland-proper. In his first act as king he made a grant or perhaps a reaffirmation of a previous grant to one of his followers, Robert de Brus, of the lordship of Annandale, on the frontier between his old principality and the lands of \\"Galloway\\": > \\"David, by the grace of God King of Scots, to all his barons, men and > friends, English and French, greetings. Know you that I have given and > granted to Robert de Brus Ystrad Annan (Annandale) and all the land from the > boundary of Dunegal of Srath Nid (Nithsdale) to the boundary of Randolph le > Meschin; and I will and grant that he should hold and have that land and its > castle well and honourably with all its customs which Ranulph le Meschin > ever had in Carduill (Carlisle) and in his land of Cumberland on that day in > which he had them most fully and freely. Witnesses: Eustace fitz John, Hugh > de Morville, Alan de Perci, William de Somerville, Berengar Engaine, Randolf > de Sules, William de Morville, Hervi fitz Warin and Edmund the chamberlain. > At Scone.\\"G. Donaldson, Scottish Historical Documents, (Edinburgh, 1970), p. > 17. This charter addresses only his \\"English and French\\" followers, and the witness list contains the names of eight Frenchmen and one Englishman; there are no Scots. By contrast, the witnesses to the charters of Alexander I issued in Scotland-proper are virtually all Gaels.e.g. Liber Ecclesie de Scon, (Bannatyne Club, 1843), nos i & iv. In 1124 then, it is possible to argue that David felt he could depend on Frenchmen and Englishmen only. It would take some time for David to reestablish himself in the country and people of his early childhood.It is also possible to argue that only English and French are addressed because the land in question concerned an area outside actual Scottish territory; see G. W. S. Barrow (ed.), The Acts of Malcolm IV King of Scots 1153–1165, Together with Scottish Royal Acts Prior to 1153 not included in Sir Archibald Lawrie's '\\"Early Scottish Charters' in Regesta Regum Scottorum, Volume I, (Edinburgh, 1960), p. 40. 2nd war against Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair In this period David was busy in some of his Scottish lands and was becoming more intimate with his native Scottish subjects. David, however, spent several long periods resident in England. In fact, outside his \\"Cumbrian\\" principality and the southern fringe of Scotland-proper, David still exercised little power, and in the words of Richard Oram, was \\"king of Scots in little more than name\\".Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 87. He was probably in the part of Scotland he did rule for most of the time between late 1127 and 1130,Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 83. but was at the court of Henry in 1126 and early 1127,A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 163–3. and returned to Henry's court in 1130 serving as a judge at Woodstock for the treason trial of Geoffrey de Clinton.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 83. It was in this year that David's wife, Matilda de Senlis, died. Possibly as a result of this,Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 84. and while David was still in southern England,A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 167. Scotland-proper rose up in arms against him. The instigator was his half-brother Máel Coluim, who now had the support of Óengus of Moray, King or Mormaer of Moray. King Óengus was David's most powerful \\"vassal\\", a man who, as grandson of King Lulach of Scotland, even had his own claim to the kingdom. The rebel Scots had advanced into Angus when they were met by David's Mercian constable, Edward; a battle took place at Stracathro near Brechin. According to the Annals of Ulster, 1000 of Edward's army, and 4000 of Óengus' army, including Óengus himself,Annals of Ulster, s.a. U1130.4, here (trans) died. According to Orderic Vitalis, Edward followed up the killing of Óengus by marching north into Moray itself, which, in his words, \\"lacked a defender and lord\\"; and so Edward, \\"with God's help obtained the entire duchy of that extensive district\\".A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 167; Anderson uses the word \\"earldom\\", but Orderic in fact used the word ducatum, duchy. However, this was far from the end of it. Máel Coluim again escaped, and four years of this continuing Scottish \\"civil war\\" followed; for David this period was quite simply a \\"struggle for survival\\".Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 88. It appears that David applied for and obtained extensive military aid from his patron, King Henry. Ailred of Rievaulx relates that at this point a large fleet and a large army of Norman knights, including Walter l'Espec, and were sent by Henry to Carlisle to assist in David's attempt to root out his Scottish enemies.A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 193–4; see also Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 86. The fleet seems to have been used in the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde and the entire Argyll coast, where Máel Coluim was probably at large among supporters. By 1134 Máel Coluim was captured and imprisoned in Roxburgh Castle.A.O. Anderson, Early Sources, vol. ii, p. 183. Pacification of the west and north Richard Oram puts forward the suggestion that it was during this period, rather than earlier, that David granted Walter fitz Alan the kadrez of Strathgryfe, with northern Kyle and the area around Renfrew, forming what would become the \\"Stewart\\" lordship of Strathgryfe; he also suggests that Hugh de Morville may have gained the kadrez of Cunningham and the settlement of \\"Strathyrewen\\" (i.e. Irvine). This would indicate that the 1130–34 campaign had resulted in the acquisition of these territories. The effect was to bring the presence of Anglo-Norman lords loyal to David into a peripheral Gaelic-speaking zone over which David had been previously little able to control, and to act as a barrier to and method of controlling the more distant provinces of Argyll and Galloway.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 116–8; Barrow, Kingship and Unity, pp. 46–7. Additionally, there is good reason to suspect that King Fergus of Galloway was brought into David's sphere of influence. At any rate, Fergus was married to an illegitimate daughter of Henry and was thus, like David, part of Henry network of allies.Oram, Lordship of Galloway, pp. 72–83. How long it took to pacify Moray is not known, but in this period it is now thought that David appointed his nephew William fitz Duncan to succeed Óengus, perhaps in compensation for the exclusion from the succession to the Scottish throne caused by the coming of age of David's son Henry. At the same time David founded the burghs of Elgin and Forres, with castles alongside. William may have been given the daughter of Óengus in marriage, cementing his authority in the region.For all this, see Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 93–6; Oram also believes that the burghs of Auldearn and Inverness may have been founded at this time, but it is more usual to ascribe the founding of these to the reign of David's grandson William the Lion; see, for instance, McNeill, Peter & MacQueen (eds), Atlas of Scottish History to 1707, (Edinburgh, 1996), pp. 196–8. David also founded in the lands of Moray Urquhart Priory, possibly as a \\"victory monastery\\", and assigned to it a percentage of his cain (tribute) from Argyll.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 91–3. During this period too, a marriage was arranged between the son of Matad, mormaer of Atholl, and the daughter of Haakon Paulsson, earl of Orkney. The marriage temporarily secured the northern frontier of the Kingdom, and held out the prospect of a son of one of David's mormaers gaining Orkney and Caithness for the Kingdom of Alba. Thus, by the time the man who made all this possible for David, Henry Beauclerc, died on 1 December 1135, David had Scotland under control for the first time.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 119. Dominating the north The ruins of Kinloss Abbey in Moray, founded by David in 1150 by a colony of Melrose Cistercians. While fighting King Stephen and attempting to dominate northern England in the following years, David was continuing his drive for control of the far north of Scotland. In 1139, his domination of Caithness (then including Sutherland) was confirmed when his cousin, the five-year-old Harald Maddadsson, was given the title of earl and half the lands of the earldom of Orkney, in addition to Scottish Caithness. Throughout the 1140s Caithness and Sutherland were brought back under the Scottish zone of control.Richard Oram, \\"David I and the Conquest of Moray\\", p. 11. Sometime before 1146, David appointed a native Scot called Aindréas to be the first bishop of Caithness, a bishopric which was based at Halkirk, near Thurso, in an area which was ethnically Scandinavian.John Dowden, The Bishops of Scotland, ed. J. Maitland Thomson, (Glasgow, 1912), p. 232; Kenneth Jackson, The Gaelic Notes in the Book of Deer: The Osborn Bergin Memorial Lecture 1970, (Cambridge, 1972), p. 80. David soon found himself active and personally present in the north of Scotland because of the death of his cousin William fitz Duncan. William died sometime between 1147 and 1151, putting the huge lordship of Moray back into David's hands.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 185. David was in the north in the year 1150, founding Kinloss Abbey, while at the same time establishing new and reinforcing old castles which formed a line running from Banff on the borders of the mormaerdom of Buchan to Inverness.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 197. At about this time, or perhaps in the following year, David visited Aberdeen. This visit is recorded in the notitiae on the margins of the Book of Deer. All of the witnesses, mormaers, bishops and lower-ranking landlords, were Gaels with interests in the north of Scotland. The charter in question was a grant to the old monastery of Deer of exemption from all kinds of lay exactions.Kenneth Jackson, Gaelic Notes, pp. 36, 79–84. Later in the year, a charter issued at Dunfermline in favour of the new abbey church there records the presence at David's court of the most notable Gaelic magnates and church officials of the north, namely Gartnait, mormaer of Buchan, Morggán, mormaer of Mar, Aindréas, bishop of Caithness, Symeon, bishop of Ross and Edward, bishop of Aberdeen. These activities and pieces of charter evidence are enough to show that consolidation of royal authority there was David's biggest priority in the first years of the 1150s.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 196–8. Máel Coluim mac Eanric. Máel Coluim IV would reign for 12 years, in a reign marked for the young king's chastity and religious fervour. He became known as \\"Malcolm the Maiden\\", and was styled by one Gaelic annalist as \\"the best Christian that was of the Gaidhil [who dwell] by the sea on the east\\"In full, the obituary reads \\"Mael Coluim Cennmor, mac Eanric, ardri Alban, in cristaidhe as ferr do bai do Gaidhelaibh re muir anair, ar deirc & aínech & crabudh, do éc\\", translated: \\"Mael-Coluim the Supreme Chief, son of Henry, high-king of Scotland, the best Christian that was of the Gaels who live in the east by the sea for almsdeeds, hospitality and piety, died\\" The Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1165.8 here. In 1150, it looked like Caithness the whole earldom of Orkney were going to come under permanent Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unawares in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let David reduce their power.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 199-200. Death and succession Perhaps the greatest blow to David's plans came on 12 July 1152, when Henry, Earl of Northumberland, David's only son and successor, died, although Henry might have been ill for some time before. David himself had under a year to live, and may have known that he himself was not going to live much longer. David quickly arranged for his grandson Máel Coluim to be made his successor, and for his younger grandson William to be made Earl of Northumberland. Donnchad I, mormaer of Fife, the senior Gaelic magnate in Scotland-proper, was appointed as rector, or regent, and made to take the 11-year-old Máel Coluim around Scotland-proper on a tour to meet and gain the homage of his future subjects. David's health began to fail seriously in the Spring of 1153 and he died on 24 May 1153.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 200–2. In his obituary in the Annals of Tigernach, he is called Dabíd mac Mail Colaim, rí Alban & Saxan, \\"David, son of Máel Coluim, King of Scotland and England\\", a title which acknowledged the new Scoto-Northumbrian identity of David's realm.Annals of Tigernach, s.a. 1153.4, here.

Kellstadt Graduate School of Business is part of the DePaul University Driehaus College of Business, a business school located in the Chicago Loop, Illinois, United States. The Driehaus College of Business (called the College of Commerce until 2012) was founded in 1912 and is one of the ten oldest business schools in the U.S. The school is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business-International. In the fall of 2012, Kellstadt enrolled 2,107 students. History DePaul’s College of Commerce began offering business classes in January 1913, becoming one of the 10 oldest business schools in the nation and the first at a U.S. Roman Catholic university. The college established a master of business administration program in 1948 and launched the Graduate School of Business. The college, including the Graduate School of Business, moved to its current Chicago location in the DePaul Center, 1 E. Jackson Blvd., in 1993. In 1971, Commerce established its first center, the Small Business Institute. In 1977, Commerce began offering graduate classes at the university’s suburban sites. Commerce established the Center for Market Analysis and Planning through a $1 million gift from the Charles H. Kellstadt Trust in 1982. In 1983, DePaul was awarded a $1 million gift from the Dr. Scholl Foundation to establish an endowed chair in its College of Commerce and Department of Finance. The Center for Business Ethics was launched in 1984. In 1986, Commerce received another $1 million grant from the Kellstadt Foundation to establish the Kellstadt Center for Marketing Analysis and Planning in Administration Center. In 1988, the five-year Arthur Andersen & Co. Alumni Distinguished Professorship in accountancy and the Touche Ross Distinguished Professorship in accountancy were established. In 1992, DePaul received a $9 million gift from the Kellstadt Foundation to establish the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business, named for Charles H. Kellstadt, former president, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears, Roebuck and Co. In 1997, Kellstadt launched its first overseas part-time MBA program in Hong Kong, that program terminated in 2005. In 2000, Kellstadt added a part-time MBA program in Bahrain. In 2002, it added another in the Czech Republic through a partnership with the Czech Management Center, and that program terminated in 2009. The program’s most recent overseas program was created in Taiwan in 2006 and terminated in 2010. In 2002, Kellstadt created the Real Estate Center, under the direction of Professor Susanne E. Cannon. In 2006, the center received three gifts in excess of $1 million: $4 million from the Michael J. Horne Foundation to endow the Horne Chair in Real Estate Studies; $2 million from Douglas and Cynthia Crocker to endow the Doug and Cynthia Crocker Director of the Real Estate Center; and $1.5 million from George Ruff to endow the Ruff Chair in Real Estate Studies. In 2007, the MacArthur Foundation awarded the center a grant of $3.5 million to launch a multi-faceted program to save affordable rental housing in the Chicago region. In 2008, Dean Ray Whittington created the Department of Real Estate, carving it out of the Department of Finance. Professor Susanne E. Cannon was chosen as the first department's first chairperson. Also in 2008, the college received a $7.5 million gift from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation to establish the School of Hospitality Leadership. In 2012, DePaul alumnus Richard H. Driehaus gave DePaul a $30 million gift to be used to recruit and retain business faculty. DePaul renamed the College of Commerce the Driehaus College of Business. Part of the Driehaus College of Business, the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business retained its name.

Fuzhou Changle International Airport is an international airport serving Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, China. The airport was inaugurated on June 23, 1997, after being approved to start constructing in 1992. The current handling capacity is approximately 6.5 million people annually. The airport is located near the shore of the Taiwan Strait in Zhanggang Subdistrict, Changle, about east of Fuzhou's city center. In 2017, Fuzhou Airport handled 12,469,235 passengers and was 29th busiest in China by total passenger traffic. In 2016 the airport was the 23rd busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic and the 28th busiest airport by traffic movements. History Changle Airport was built to replace the old (), a dual-use military and civil airport located in Cangshan District, and prepared for the base of the direct flights to Taiwan across the straits. The airport was designed by Singaporean RSP Architects Planners & Engineers Pte Ltd. The government of Fujian province hoped that the new airport could reach the standard of Singapore Changi Airport, but they soon realized it was too big, and shrank the scale of the airport. However, the scale of the airport was still much bigger than the norm that central government approved. Changle Airport was opened in 1997. Due to the lack of Passenger flow, the airport had a great deficit in early years of operation. In 2003, the management of the airport was taken over by Xiamen International Airport Group, and began profiting from 2005. In February 2017, Xiamen Airlines operated Changle's first direct route to North America, with a Boeing 787-9 service to New York–JFK airport. On 11 December 2018, a second intercontinental route to Paris was launched. =Future expansion= In September 2019, the National Development and Reform Commission approved for airport phase two expansion project. The project includes the following construction works: * Construction of a 3600m x 60m second runway and relevant taxiway. * Construction of a 255,000m2 second terminal. * Construction of 60 new aircraft stands, eight cargo aircraft stands and relevant supporting facilities. * Construction of second air traffic control tower and new 9000m2 air traffic management centre. * Reconstruction of existing air traffic control tower and air traffic management centre. The airport targets 36 million passengers and 450,000 tonnes cargo per year by 2030 upon project completion.  Location  Fuzhou Changle International Airport is located at 25°56´ north latitude and 119°39´ east longitude. It is surrounded by the sea on three sides. The surrounding area of the airport is flat, but it extends southwest and northeast, surrounded by mountains.  Traffic  = Taxi = There is a taxi waiting at the exit of the arrival hall. The city's unified price starts at 10 yuan / 3 kilometers, and 2 yuan per kilometer thereafter. = Bus = The airport passenger terminal has a number of fixed shuttle routes to Fuzhou City and surrounding areas, opening hours from 4:30-22:30. = Highway = There are many expressways that can directly reach Changle International Airport, such as Shenhai Expressway, Fuyin Expressway, and Airport Expressway. = Subway = According to the newly released intercity railway construction plan for the west coast of Fujian Province, the Fuzhou-Changle Airport Intercity Railway (F1/3) will be directly connected to the airport, and will be passed by Metro Line 6 near the airport.  Climate  Fuzhou Changle International Airport has a subtropical maritime climate, with the northeast monsoon prevailing in the winter half year and the southwest monsoon in the summer half year. There will be continuous rainy weather in spring. Due to typhoon and subtropical high pressure, there are often strong winds and heavy rains in summer. There will be continuously sunny weather in winter. In addition to the southerly winds in the south of July, Changle Airport is dominated by the northerly winds in the other 11 months, and there are mountain hills in the west of the Changle Plain. Typical climate characteristics of Changle Airport are: (1) , cloudy, low cloud base; (2) abundant rainfall, large number of rainy days; (3) fast wind speed, large number of windy days, and the annual average wind speed is 4.5 m/s (4) the airport has less thunderstorms, but the airport airspace has frequent thunderstorms (5)well marked sea-land breeze effect (6) humid air, the annual average relative humidity is 75%. Airlines and destinations =Passenger= \\"Welcome back to the Land of Blessings\\" (), the sign reads, indicating the airport is right ahead. =Cargo=  Delays  = Statistics = In 2017, the total throughput of Changle Airport ranked 28 in China, carrying passengers up to 12,469,235 throughout the year. In the latest airport punctuality rate ranking in October 2018, Changle Airport ranked 16, which is 83.19%, with an average delay of 23 minutes. Delays of more than 60 minutes are rare, only 2.54%. = Causes =  Thunderstorm  Aviation and weather are closely connected. Thunderstorms are currently recognized as one of the most important weather phenomena that seriously affect the safety of airport and efficiency of flights. When flying in thunderstorms area, passengers and crew may encounter dangerous weather such as wind shear, bumps, hail, downburst, etc. In recent years, Fuzhou Changle International Airport has experienced a rapid growth for flight delays and return flight due to thunderstorms. In 2016, the number of flights affected by thunderstorms at Changle Airport was 729, taking up 38.4% of the total number of flights affected by the weather. The annual average thunderstorm of Fuzhou Changle International Airport is 27.3d which is considerably frequent and has a greater impact on flight. Thunderstorms vary greatly from year to year, and thunderstorms may occur throughout the year. As the temperature rises, thunderstorms frequency begin to increase. The main activity period of thunderstorms at Fuzhou Airport is from March to September. Thunderstorms appear most frequent in summer, with an average number of days of 13.5 days, accounting for 49.5 percent of the total number of thunderstorms in the year. Compared to other months of the year, the thunderstorms in June showed the highest number, with an average of 5.1d. Most are dry thunderstorms and are not prone to rainfall. Thunder mainly concentrated in the afternoon to the middle of the night, with the highest frequency occurring at 17: 00. Thunderstorms may occur in all directions of Fuzhou Airport, among them, west direction has highest frequency, followed by the northwest and southwest directions. This is because the eastern part of the airport is the ocean, the west is the mountainous area, and the convection over the mountains is stronger than the ocean.  Visibility  The average visibility in the first half of the year is less than 1000 meters. The number of days is significantly higher than that in the second half, accounting for 83% of the whole year. The visibility of the airport has obvious seasonal differences, showing the worst visibility in spring.

Caminho) The Double () is a 2002 novel by Portuguese author José Saramago, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. In Portuguese, the title is literally \\"The Duplicated Man.\\" It was translated into English and published as The Double in 2004. Plot summary Tertuliano Máximo Afonso is a divorced high school history teacher who spends his nights reading about Mesopotamian civilizations. One day Tertuliano rents a movie recommended by a colleague and sees an actor who looks exactly like him. Tertuliano becomes obsessed with meeting the actor and spends weeks discovering the actor's name. Posing as a film student and using his girlfriend's address, he sends a letter to the production company asking to be put in contact with the actor. His relationship with his girlfriend, Maria da Paz, suffers because he refuses to disclose his motives to her. After acquiring the actor's phone number and address, Tertuliano stalks his double, António Claro, and eventually telephones him. António's wife answers and mistakes Tertuliano's voice for her husband's. Initially, António dismisses Tertuliano and refuses to meet, but later contacts him and agrees. They decide to meet at António's country home in a week. Tertuliano buys a fake beard and goes to meet António. Upon arrival, the men strip down and find that they are indeed physically identical. They have the same birth date. Their voices are identical and they share the same scars and moles. António asks Tertuliano to clarify one more thing: the exact time he was born. He wants to know which of them is the \\"original\\" and which the copy. Tertuliano says that he was born at two in the afternoon. António smugly informs Tertuliano that he was born a half-hour earlier, making him the original. Tertuliano gets up to leave, saying that he at least has the compensation of knowing that António will be the first to die, and that he will become the original in turn. To this António responds, \\"Well, I hope you enjoy those thirty-one minutes of personal, absolute, and exclusive identity, because that is all you will enjoy from now on.\\" The men agree that they have no reason to ever meet again, and Tertuliano leaves. Tertuliano sends the fake beard to António, who has not been able to stop thinking about their encounter. Meanwhile, Tertuliano and Maria get engaged to be married. António wonders how Tertuliano acquired his phone number and address. He visits the production company office and retrieves the letter Tertuliano authored and sent in Maria's name. Donning the fake beard, António stakes out Maria's apartment and, finding her very attractive, he follows her to work. António realizes that Tertuliano has not told Maria about his double. Soon after, António pays Tertuliano a visit at home. He shows Tertuliano the letter with Maria's signature. Threatened, Tertuliano tells him to leave, saying he will call the police. António says that he will call Maria and tell her of Tertuliano's forgery. Tertuliano asks what he wants, and António says he intends to spend the night with Maria. António has already contacted her while pretending to be Tertuliano and invited her to look at a country home with him, his country home. António wants revenge for Tertuliano's intrusion into his stable married life. Furious and ashamed, Tertuliano gives António his clothes, identification, and the keys to his. After António leaves, Tertuliano exchanges his clothes for some in António's closet. He drives in António's car to António's house, where he makes love to António's wife Helena that night. In the morning, she makes him breakfast while he reads the paper without ever suspecting that he is not her husband. Meanwhile, Maria and António have spent the night together. In the morning, Maria wakes first and notices the indentation on António's finger from his wedding ring. She deduces that he is not Tertuliano and demands she be allowed to leave. Tertuliano had hoped that António would return to find him in bed with Helena. As time passes without António returning home, he becomes anxious about Maria, leaves António and Helena's home, and rushes to a pay phone to call Maria's house. A colleague of Maria's answers the phone and tells him that Maria died earlier that morning in a car accident. Tertuliano checks into a hotel and calls his mother to tell her he is alive. She meets him at the hotel and he tells her the entire story. The next day, he buys a newspaper to learn the details of the accident: a head-on collision with a truck. The truck driver, when questioned by police, said that the passengers in the car appeared to be quarreling before their automobile crossed the center lane and crashed into the truck. Tertuliano returns to António's house and reveals his identity to Helena, explaining that the man who died was her husband. He gives her António's identification and asks for her forgiveness. She responds: \\"Forgive is just a word.\\" Helena asks Tertuliano to stay with her and take the place of her husband, and he accepts her invitation. Three days later, as Tertuliano is reading about Mesopotamian civilization, the phone rings. He answers and a man on the other end of the line exclaims, \\"At last!\\" in a voice identical to his own. The man says he has been trying to reach him for months and claims to be his double. Tertuliano agrees to meet him in a nearby park that night. Tertuliano changes his clothes, loads the pistol he keeps in the house, and puts it into his belt. He writes Helena a note, \\"I'll be back\\", and leaves for his rendezvous in the park. Critical reception The Guardian said Saramago did not push the concept of the double far enough, noting that every culture plays with this idea. He wrote: Jonathan Carroll of the Washington Post criticized the novel, saying that he displays: John Banville in the New York Times wrote of The Double: \\"His take on the theme is clever, alarming and blackly funny...\\" Banville continues about Saramago's work: \\"He has Kafka's petrified detachment, Celine's merry ferocity and the headlong, unstoppable style of the Beckett of Malone Dies and The Unnamable.\\"John Banville, \\"'The Double': The Tears of a Clone\\", New York Times, 10 October 2004 John Updike praised the novel at length in The New Yorker as did the reviewer for the London Review of Books. Film adaptation Denis Villeneuve directed a Canadian thriller feature film, Enemy in 2013, with a screenplay adapted by Javier Gullón from this novel. Set in Toronto, it stars Jake Gyllenhaal in a dual role as the physically identical men Adam and Anthony, Isabella Rossellini as Adam's mother, Mélanie Laurent as the professor Adam's girlfriend Mary, and Sarah Gadon as the actor Anthony's wife Helen. The novel shares a quote with the film, shown in the opening scene: > \\"Chaos is order yet undeciphered.\\" Villeneuve and Gullón, in their film adaptation, extend the screenplay to include a subtle yet major underlying theme absent in the novel. We hear the theme played out first when the professor Adam Bell teaches his college history students about totalitarianism and how dictators strive to remove our uniqueness. This theme appears unexplained, often subconsciously, in scenes throughout. Villeneuve hinted at this before the film's release in a 2013 interview for the Huffington Post, remarking \\"If you look at Enemy again, you can see that everything has an answer and a meaning. It’s a movie that is set to a game. It’s not something that gives answers.\\" This is certainly true of the film's ending scene, in which Adam is inexplicably confronted by a gigantic tarantula, which terrifies and unnerves the viewer, leaving questions about what the film was really about, and what, if anything, we understood about the characters. In that sense, the film remains faithful to Saramago's novel, while adding a compelling subplot that evokes Saramago's ethos (Saramago grew up in Portugal under a fascist regime, and often wrote allegorically about totalitarianism and his experiences with it).

This includes, among others, the rules by which the requirements of the Oral Law and the Halakha are derived from and established by the written law. These rules relate to: * grammar and exegesis * the interpretation of certain words and letters and apparently superfluous and/or missing words or letters, and prefixes and suffixes * the interpretation of those letters which, in certain words, are provided with points * the interpretation of the letters in a word according to their numerical value (see Gematria) * the interpretation of a word by dividing it into two or more words (see Notarikon) * the interpretation of a word according to its consonantal form or according to its vocalization * the interpretation of a word by transposing its letters or by changing its vowels * the logical deduction of a halakhah from a Scriptural text or from another law  Classes of rules  Compilations of such hermeneutic rules were made in the earliest times. The tannaitic tradition recognizes three such collections, namely: # the 7 Rules of Hillel (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; Avot of Rabbi Natan 37) # the 13 Rules of Rabbi Ishmael (Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is merely an amplification of that of Hillel) # the 32 Rules of Rabbi Eliezer ben Jose HaGelili. These last- mentioned rules are contained in an independent baraita (Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules) which has been incorporated and preserved only in later works. They are intended for haggadic interpretation, but many of them are valid for the Halakah as well, coinciding with the rules of Hillel and Ishmael. It must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor Eliezer ben Jose sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day. For some reason they restricted themselves to a compilation of the principal methods of logical deduction, which they called \\"middot\\" (measures), although the other rules also were known by that term.Compare Sifre, Num. 2 [ed. Friedmann, p. 2a] Those rules are traditionally studied and applied to the religious texts of some biblical canon, which were commonly believed to be inspired by God himself, through the words and the actions of human people. Therefore, those rules were related in coordination with the four independent level of biblical reading, as in the acronym Pardes.  Dates of the rules  All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in Ayyelet HaShachar, the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra, and have been reckoned at 613, to correspond with the 613 commandments. The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them, meaning that they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot of Hillel and the 13 of Rabbi Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them. At all events, he did not invent them, but merely collected them as current in his day, though he possibly amplified them. They were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricting or expanding them, in various ways. The Talmud itself gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim regarded them as Sinaitic (הלכה למשה מסיני, \\"Law given to Moses at Mount Sinai\\"; comp. Rabbi Samson of Chinon in his Sefer HaKeritot). Rules of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. Rabbi Akiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Rabbi Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles which guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different. = Superfluity in the text = According to Rabbi Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous. He established two principles broadening the scope of the rule of his teacher Nahum of Gimzo, who had declared that certain particles, like את, גם and או, were inclusive and certain others, such as אך, רק and מן, were exclusive. These two principles are: * אין רבוי אחר רבוי אלא למעט (= \\"one inclusion added to another is equivalent to an exclusion\\")Sifra, Tzav, Pereḳ, 11 [ed. I.H. Weiss, p. 34d] * לשונות רבויין הן (= \\"words are amplifications\\")Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 19 17a Hence he interprets the following forms of expression as amplifications: an infinitive before a finite verb, e.g., הכרת תכרת (Sanhedrin 64b); the doubling of a word, e.g., איש איש (Yeb. 71a); and the repetition of a term by a synonym, e.g., ודבר ואמר (Jerusalem Talmud Soṭah 8 22b). Ishmael, on the contrary, lays down the principle \\"the Torah speaks in the language of men\\",דברה תורה כלשון בני אדם ; Sifre, Num. 112 and thus may have employed superfluous words and sounds; and forced values should not be assigned to them for the purpose of deducing new rules therefrom. The same statement holds with regard to the repetition of an entire section. Ishmael is of the opinion that \\"the Torah at times repeats a whole section of the Law in order to give a new application to it\\".כל פרשה שנאמרה במקום אחד וחזרו שנאה במקום אחר לא שנאה אלא בשביל דבר שנתחדש בה ; Sifre, Num. 2, according to the reading of Elijah of Vilna It is unnecessary, therefore, to draw a new inference from every repetition. Thus, for instance, in Numbers 5:5-8 the Torah repeats the laws of Leviticus 5:20-26Leviticus 6:1-7 in A. V. for the purpose of teaching the new ruling that in certain cases recompense for sin shall be made directly to the priests. Akiva asserts, on the other hand,in Sifre, l.c., according to the reading of Elijah of Vilna that \\"Everything that is said in a section so repeated must be interpreted\\",= כל מה שנאמר בה צריך להדרש and that new deductions may be drawn from it. According to this view, in Numbers 5:5-8 a new meaning must be sought in the repetition of the Law. =Vocalization of words= In cases where the consonantal spelling of a word (in the Hebrew text) differs from the traditional vowelization by which the word is pronounced, Akiva derives laws from the word's pronunciation (יש אם למקרא), while Ishmael derives laws from the written spelling (יש אם למסורת). For example: In Leviticus 21:11, the word נַפְשֹׁת is written without the letter vav. The vowelization indicates that the word should be translated as \\"bodies\\", but the unvowelled consonants would normally be translated as \\"body\\". Since the vowelization indicates the plural, Akiva concludes that a quarter-log of blood (the minimum quantity by which a priest becomes impure through contact with a single corpse) also defiles him when it issues from two bodies. According to Ishmael, however, this minimum quantity defiles a priest only when it issues from a single corpse (for the word, according to the consonantal text, is to be read in the singular \\"nafshat\\").Compare Sanhedrin 4a, b, Hullin 72a, and Tosafot to both passages =Juxtaposition of sections= According to Rabbi Akiva, laws may be deduced from the juxtaposition of two legal sections, since \\"every passage which stands close to another must be explained and interpreted with reference to its neighbor\\".כל פרשה שהיא סמוכה לחבירתה למדה הימנה; Sifre, Numbers 131 According to Ishmael, on the contrary, nothing may be inferred from the position of the individual sections, since it is not at all certain that every single portion now stands in its proper place. Many a paragraph which forms, strictly speaking, the beginning of a book and should stand in that position, has been transposed to the middle. Ishmael explains the occurrence of a section in a place where it does not properly belong (ולמה נכתב כאן) by declaring that \\"there is no first or last in the Scriptures\\",אלא מפני שאין מקדם ומאחר בתורה not as due to any special reason.Mekhilta, ed. Weiss, p. 48a; Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1; compare Pesahim 6b, where Rav Papa defines this principle in such a manner that it does not contradict Ishmael's rules concerning \\"Kelal uferat\\" Eliezer ben Jose expanded this rule in his baraita (Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules) and divided it into two parts (Nos. 31 and 32). Nonetheless, this method is utilized in many instances, for example: Deuteronomy 22:11 forbids the wearing of shaatnez (a specific mixture of wool and linen), while 22:12 commands the wearing of tzitzit. The juxtaposition of these two verses is used to teach that (in theory) the transgression of shaatnez is not violated when one wears a four-cornered linen garment bearing tzitzit of wool (the blue tekhelet string of tzitzit is only valid when made of wool).The Shaatnez Exception Juxtaposition through \\"exemplification\\" or משל has recently been described by Talmudist Daniel Boyarin as the sine qua non of Talmudic hermeneutics (Boyarin 2003: 93), for \\"until Solomon invented the mashal, no one could understand Torah at all\\" (Song of Songs Rabba). The phenomenon has been compared to the more recent phenomenon of sampling in modern popular music, especially hip-hop (Levy 2010). =Fusion of methodologies= The opposition between the schools of Ishmael and Akiva lessened gradually, and finally vanished altogether, so that the later tannaim apply the axioms of both indiscriminately, although the hermeneutics of Akiva predominated.  Detailed rules  =Kal va-chomer (קל וחומר)= The first rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael is \\"kal va-chomer\\" (), called also \\"din\\" (conclusion). This is the argument \\"a minori ad majus\\" or \\"a majori ad minus\\". In the Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules this rule is divided into two (Nos. 5 and 6), since a distinction is made between a course of reasoning carried to its logical conclusion in the Holy Scriptures themselves (\\"kal va-chomer meforash\\") and one merely suggested there (\\"kal va-chomer satum\\"). The completed argument is illustrated in ten examples given in Genesis Rabbah xcii. The full name of this rule should be \\"kal va-chomer, chomer ve-kal\\" (simple and complex, complex and simple), since by it deductions are made from the simple to the complex or vice versa, according to the nature of the conclusion required. The major premise on which the argument is based is called \\"nadon\\", or, at a later period, \\"melammed\\" (that which teaches); the conclusion resulting from the argument is termed בא מן הדין (\\"ba min ha-din\\", that which \\"comes from the rule\\") or, later, \\"lamed\\" (that which learns). The process of deduction in the kal va-chomer is limited by the rule that the conclusion may contain nothing more than is found in the premise. This is the so-called \\"dayyo\\" law, which many teachers, however, ignored. It is formulated thus: דיו לבא מן הדין להיות כנדון (\\"The conclusion of an argument is satisfied when it is like the major premise\\"). There is a dispute regarding the thirteen principles: Either the kal va-chomer is unique among the thirteen rules in that it may be applied by anyone in any circumstance in which it logically applies and the remaining twelve rules may only be applied with a tradition of application descending from Moses (or another authoritative legal board of the era) or all thirteen except a gezerah shava are open to all and only the latter is restricted in its application. For example, one may make the following logical reasoning and support it using the basis of this rule: If, as a given, a parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. The reasoning is based on pure logic: if the parent is so upset about one item of clothing, surely he or she will be at least that upset about the child's entire ensemble. A somewhat easier construct would be to assert \\"if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make the same three-pointer,\\" but this might be attacked as a poor analogy because not everyone can make every shot. However, one must be careful of falling into the trap of an illogical deduction, as explained above by \\"dayyo\\". An example of this would be as follows: If a parent will punish his or her child with a minor punishment should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child with a major punishment should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. This is an illogical deduction; although it might be a fair speculation, it cannot be proven with logic. All that can be proven is at least the result of the lesser offense. This would be akin to asserting \\"if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make a half-court shot.\\" The discovery of a fallacy in the process of deduction is called \\"teshuvah\\" (objection), or, in the terminology of the amoraim, \\"pirka\\". The possibility of such an objection is never wholly excluded, hence the deduction of the kal va-chomer has no absolute certainty. The consequences of this are: (a) that the conclusions have, according to many teachers, no real value in criminal procedure, a view expressed in the axiom that the conclusion is insufficient to punish the violator of an inferred prohibition (אין עונשין מן הדין ; Sifre, Num. 1); (b) that very often a passage is interpreted to mean something which may be inferred by means of a kal va-chomer (מילתא דאתיא בק\\"ו טרח וכתב לה קרא ; Pesahim 18b; Yoma 43a). An example of a situation in which transgressions are specifically not punished according to kal va-chomer is as follows: Leviticus 18:21 speaks of the prohibition of worshiping Molech, a form of worship in which children were passed through fire (presumably until dead). Now, one would assume that if it were prohibited to pass some of one's children through the fire, surely it would be prohibited to pass all of one's children through the fire –- a kal va-chomer. However, it is derived from the verse's use of the word \\"ומזרעך\\", lit. \\"and from your seed\\", that this prohibition is only when some of one's children are sacrificed in this worship; when all of one's children are sacrificed, this is not punishable. This is explained with the reasoning that the intention of the Molech worship is to improve the health and well-being of one's remaining children, whereas complete sacrifice defeats the purported purpose of the service, rendering it unpunishable by lack of intent to perform it properly. =Gezerah shavah (גזירה שוה)= The gezerah shavah (\\"Similar laws, similar verdicts\\") is the second rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael, and the seventh of Eliezer ben Jose HaGelili. This may be described as argument by analogy, which infers from the similarity of two cases that the legal decision given for the one holds good for the other also. The term gezerah shavah originally included arguments based on analogies either in word or in fact. Before long, however, the latter class was designated as hekkesh, while the phrase gezerah shavah was limited to analogy in the case of two different Biblical laws containing a word common to both. The gezerah shavah was originally restricted to a δὶς λεγόμενον (dis legomenon), i.e., a word occurring only in the two passages offering the analogy. Since such a word is found nowhere else, there is no reason to assume that it bears different meanings in the two passages. The gezerah shavah consequently attaches to the word in the one passage the entire sequence of ideas which it bears in the other. Such a gezerah shavah is purely lexicographical, as seeking to determine the exact signification of a word by comparison with another passage in which the full meaning of such word is clear. The rule thus demonstrates itself. For example: The phrase מלק את ראשו (\\"to wring off the head\\") occurs only twice in the Pentateuch (Leviticus 1:15, 5:8). In 5:8, however, the meaning of the phrase is more closely defined by ממול ערפו (\\"from the neck\\"). The Sifraed. Weiss, p. 9a concludes, therefore, that the elaboration \\"from the neck\\" (in 5:8) is part of the concept of the word מלק, and consequently that מלק means \\"to wring the head from the neck\\" in 1:15 also. At a later period, however, the gezerah shavah emerged from these narrow bounds and inferred the identity of legal requirements from the identity of their terminology, even when such terminology occurred in many passages besides the two which formed the analogy. Thereby the gezerah shavah lost its inherent power of demonstration; for it is wholly unreasonable to attribute to a word a meaning which happens to be associated with it in a single passage, when various other passages connect ideas entirely different with the same word. Since, moreover, each individual teacher might choose which two expressions he would select for a gezerah shavah, contradictory conclusions might be drawn, which would each have the same claim to validity, since both were obtained by a gezerah shavah. Consequently, in order to be binding, a gezerah shavah was obliged to conform to two requirements which, on the one hand, greatly restricted its application, and, on the other, gave legal decisions thus obtained the value of those deduced from a superfluous word in the Holy Scriptures. These conditions are: * \\"No one may draw a gezerah shavah upon his own authority\\"אין אדם דן גזירה שוה מעצמו; Pes. 66a; Niddah 19b This rule, however, is not to be regarded as implying that every gezerah shavah must have been handed down from Mount Sinai, as Rashi (on the various passages) and many expositors who followed him explained it, but that the use of this method of hermeneutics is to be permitted only to an entire board or council, and is to be employed only when its results agree with the traditional halakah, which thereby acquires the importance of a law implied in the Scriptures. In Yerushalmi this rule reads: אדם דן גזירה שוה לקיים תלמודו ואין אדם דן גזירה שוה לבטל תלמודו (\\"From a gezerah shavah conclusions may be deduced which support tradition, but not such as are opposed to tradition\\"; comp. Maimonides in the introduction to his Mishneh Torah). * The words of the text which form the basis of the deduction from analogy must be free, i.e., they must be superfluous and non-essential, or they may not be used (מופנה להקיש ולדין הימנו גזירה שוה). This limitation of the gezerah shavah, however, to superfluous words is not generally recognized. Akiva considers the gezerah shavah valid when neither of the two words is superfluous (אינו מופנה כלל). According to Rabbi Ishmael, it is sufficient if the analogy is free on one side (מופנה מצד אחד), i.e., if one of the two words forming the basis of the analogy is pleonastic. Rabbi Eliezer alone requires both words to be superfluous.מופנה משני צדדים; comp. David Zvi Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim, p. 6 =Binyan ab mi- katuv echad (בנין אב מכתוב אחד)= In \\"binyan ab mi-katub echad\\" (\\"A standard from a passage of Scripture\\") a certain passage serves as a basis for the interpretation of many others, so that the decision given in the case of one is valid for all the rest. =Binyan ab mi-shene ketubim (בנין אב משני כתובים)= By this rule of \\"binyan ab mi-shene ketubim\\" (\\"A standard from two passages of Scripture\\") a decision in two laws having a characteristic in common (הצד השוה) is applied to many other laws which have this same characteristic. Rabbi Ishmael unites rules 2 and 4 in his third rule, while the same combination forms the eighth rule of Rabbi Eliezer. =Kelal u-perat and perat u-kelal (כלל ופרט ופרט וכלל)= The rules of \\"Kelal u-perat\\" and \\"perat u-kelal\\" (\\"General and particular, particular and general\\") is a limitation of the general by the particular and vice versa. According to Rabbi Ishmael, this principle has eight special applications, and thus includes eight separate rules in his scheme (Nos. 4-11). This method of limitation is one of the main points of difference between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the former, who follows his teacher Rabbi Nehunya ben HaKanah, the particular is only an elucidation of the preceding general expression, so that the latter includes only what is contained in the particular (כלל ופרט אין בכלל אלא מה שבפרט). But if still another general follows the particular, the two general expressions are defined by the intermediate particular, so that the law applies only to what is like the particular (כלל ופרט וכלל אי אתה מרבה אלא כעין הפרט). Akiva, on the contrary, applies the rule of increase and decrease (רבוי ומיעוט) which had been taught him by his teacher Nahum of Gimzo. According to this principle, the general followed by a particular subsumes everything which is like the particular (Sanhedrin 45b, 46a). If, however, another general term follows the particular, the former subsumes also what is not similar to the latter. The two general terms are decreased in only one respect by the intermediate particular (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי ריבה הכל ומאי מיעט דבר אחר ; Shebu. 26a; comp. also Rashi on Sanhedrin l.c.). The difference between kelal u-perat u-kelal (כלל ופרט וכלל) and ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי) is exemplified in the following example: Exodus 25:31 states ועשית מנרת זהב טהור מקשה תיעשה המנורה, \\"You shall make a Menorah of pure gold, hammered out shall the Menorah be made.\\" The repetitive fashion of the statement can be explained by the kelal u-perat u-kelal or the ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui. Whichever method of deduction is employed, the word ועשית (\\"You shall make\\") is an objective generalization, the words מנרת זהב (\\"pure gold\\") are an objective specification and the word תיעשה (shall be made\\") is again an objective generalization. The rule of kelal u-perat u-kelal works to teach that anything similar to the specification is deemed appropriate, while the rule of ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui is more inclusive, allowing everything except the thing most dissimilar to the specification. Thus, Rashi's commentary in Rosh Hashanah 24b asserts that, according to the former method of learning this verse, the Menorah could, when necessary, be constructed of any metal (deemed in the same category of and thus similar to gold), whereas use of the latter method of learning would allow the Menorah to be constructed of anything but clay (deemed the material most dissimilar to gold). This argument arose because the gemarah made reference to a wooden Menorah overlaid with tin that was constructed in the times of the Chashmunaim and used in the Temple service. =Ka-yotze bo mi-makom acher (כיוצא בו ממקום אחר)= The rule \\"Ka-yotze bo mi-makom acher\\" (\\"Like that in another place\\") refers to explaining a Biblical passage according to another of similar content. =Davar ha-lamed me-inyano (דבר הלמד מעניינו)= Dabar ha-lamed me-inyano (\\"Something proved by the context\\") refers to definition from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead which is not found in Hillel, and which reads thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם (\\"If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage\\"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by the help of a third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are pointed in the text, Simeon ben Eleazar laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must not be interpreted at all; but if one part is longer than the other, such part must be interpreted (Genesis Rabbah lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא (\\"Do not read so, but so\\"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation. To support a halakhic decision, and more especially to find a point of departure in the aggadah, the traditional reading of a word is altered by transposition of its consonants or by substitution of others which are related to them, or the consonant-group is retained with alteration of its vowels, the last method being the most frequent. A halakic example of this form of hermeneutics is the interpretation of the word \\"kapot\\" (bough; Leviticus 23:40) as though it were \\"kaput\\" (bound; Sifra, ed. Weiss, p. 102d; Sukkah 32a). It is noteworthy, moreover, that only the tannaim derived new halakot with the aid of these rules, while the amoraim employed them only in advancing haggadic explanations or in establishing the old halakhot of the Tannaim. *The JE cites the following works: ** Saadia Gaon, Commentary on the thirteen middot of Rabbi Ishmael, published by Schechter in Bet Talmud, iv. 237 et seq., and in the Œuvres Complètes, ix. 73-83; ** Rashi, Commentary on the thirteen rules, in Kobak's Jeschurun, vi., Hebrew part, pp. 38–44, 201-204; **the remaining commentaries on the thirteen rules are enumerated by Adolf Jellinek in Kuntres HaKelalim, Nos. 163-175; ** Samson of Chinon, Sefer Keritut, Warsaw, 1854; ** Malachi Kohen, Yad Mal'aki, Berlin, 1852; ** Aaron ibn Ḥayyim, Middot Aharon; ** Solomon Algazi, Yavin Shemu'ah; ** Jacob Hirsch Jolles, Melo HaRo'im, part ii.; ** Hirsch Chajes, Mebo ha-Talmud, Zolkiev, 1845; ** Malbim, Ayyelet HaShaḥar; ** Z.

History Balaban and Katz Theatre corporation started in 1916 in Chicago by A. J. Balaban and his brother-in-law Sam Katz (1892-1961). It held its first meeting as a Delaware corporation on January 21, 1925. Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, forerunner of Paramount Pictures, bought a controlling interest in Balaban and Katz Corporation in 1926. It became a part of United Paramount Theatres in 1948 after Paramount was forced to sell off its theaters. The company also held at the Paramount Pictures-Theaters split in 1949: WBKB (TV), WIBK (FM), 25% of WSMB New Orleans, 50% of a company applying for an Atlanta AM license, 10% of another licensee apply for a license in Hot Springs, and television applications for Detroit, Boston, Tampa, and Des Moines. Balaban & Katz became a subsidiary of United Paramount Theatres, Inc. (UPT). UPT merged with American Broadcasting Company in 1953. The company was officially dissolved as an Illinois corporation on July 31, 1970.  Theaters  Balaban and Katz chose to build their theaters (many designed by famous architects Rapp and Rapp) in rapidly growing outlying districts, convenient for the middle class population which provided the bulk of their patrons, as well as in downtown Chicago. The company is notable for being the first to offer air conditioning in its theaters and for including lavish stage shows. Balaban and Katz operated over a hundred theaters in the midwestern United States. There were more than 50 Chicago-area theaters operated by the Balaban and Katz company including: North: Belmont, Century/Diversey Theatre, Cine, Covent, Granada, Howard, Lakeside, Northshore, Nortown, Pantheon, Riviera, and Uptown. Northwest: Admiral, Alba, Belpark, Biltmore, Congress, Crystal, Drake, Gateway Theatre, Harding, Luna, Portage, Terminal, and Will Rogers. South, Maryland, Regal, Southtown, Tivoli, and Tower. West: Central Park, Iris, Manor, Marbro, Paradise, Senate, and State. Loop: Apollo, Chicago, Garrick, Oriental, Roosevelt, and United Artists. Suburban Chicago: Berwyn, Coronet, La Grange, Park, Valencia, and Varsity. Waukegan: Academy Sam Katz, a vice president at Balaban and Katz, became president of The Publix theaters group, a division of Famous Players Lasky. Its secretary, Barney Balaban, eventually became president of Paramount Pictures. Beginning in 1939, Balaban and Katz, along with parent company Paramount, was involved in the early development of the television broadcasting industry. The company owned several experimental television licenses, and in 1943 began broadcasting over WBKB (now WBBM-TV), the first commercial television station in Chicago. Whenever Balaban and Katz decided that murals would become part of the interior design scheme, they would commission painter and muralist Louis Grell of Chicago to execute them. Grell painted murals inside the Chicago Theater, Gateway Theater, Uptown Theater and many Paramount Theaters across the midwest and America for Balaban and Katz. The trademark for the company is owned by a historical foundation called the Balaban and Katz Historical Foundation. The foundation was founded by descendants of the original Balaban brothers. Its collection of B and K corporate documents is located in New Jersey. Theatre Historical Society, in Elmhurst, Illinois, maintains an extensive collection of architectural blueprints and large-format pictures of many Balaban and Katz theaters. In 2006, a documentary, Uptown: Portrait of a Palace, featured one of Balaban and Katz's most famous theaters, the Uptown. 2006 also saw the publication of a book on many of the B&K; theatres, titled The Chicago Movie Palaces of Balaban and Katz, written by David Balaban with a foreword by theater historian Joseph DuciBella and published by Arcadia Publishing.

McAuley's second attempt began on 11 January 2007 and ended on 12 February, when the search for his missing body was called off following the recovery of his partly flooded kayak on 10 February about short of his destination, Milford Sound. The sleeping arrangements at sea involved deploying a sea anchor, squeezing his body down into the kayak, and sealing the hatch with a bulbous fibreglass capsule (dubbed \\"Casper\\") fitted with an air-only ventilator, which, with its self-righting capabilities, made possible riding out the most severe storm conditions that are inevitable in that part of the ocean. However, when the capsule was pivoted to its stowing position behind the cockpit, it made a kayak roll impossible due to being filled with water like a bucket. Therefore, whenever he capsized, he had to swim out of the kayak, push it upright, and perform full self-rescue.Solo: Lost at Sea broadcast 2007-09-15 National Geographic (57 minutes), broadcast on BBC as Solitary Endeavour on the Southern on 2009-02-22 When his kayak was recovered, only this capsule was missing. It was presumed to have been torn off by a freak wave. One of its pivot arms had already been damaged. Veteran sailor Jonathan Borgais, who was directing the expedition by providing weather predictions, said, \\"From the beginning, my biggest concern was the approach to New Zealand. And this part of New Zealand is notoriously dangerous. On a good day, you can get rogue waves: a two- or three-metre set that can come out of nowhere. Not big, but powerful. That's very dangerous. I have no doubt that a wave got him.\\" Aftermath The documentary of McAuley's journey, Solo, incorporated video footage recovered from one surviving memory stick in his camera, as well as interviews with people on his team during the expedition. It begins with the distress call he made on the evening of 9 February: \\"Do you copy? This is kayak one. Do you copy, over? I've got an emergency situation. I'm in a kayak about 30 km from Milford Sound. I need a rescue. My kayak's sinking.

In the same summer, a specially constructed, two-person kayak crossed the Tasman Sea by a more northerly route. The competitive spirit may have played a part in McAuley's determination to make the journey when he did.

An Arabic foundation inscription on the mosque records that it was commissioned by Mehmed Beg b. Abu al-Saʿadat’ who was a brother of a vizier in the year AH 965 (1557-58). Some scholars have claimed that the vizier was the grand vizier Rüstem Pasha, but Rüstem Pasha is recorded as having only a single brother, Sinan Pasha. The mosque may have been designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan. It is in the form of a domed cube fronted by a double portico. The three domes of the inner portico are supported by four marble columns. The outer portico has a shed roof resting on small octagonal pillars. The large dome of the mosque sits on an octagonal fenestrated drum which is supported by eight-pointed arches.

The songs, performed by Smith with local musicians, were compiled on a cassette titled Songs of Peace and 20,000 copies were distributed around the province. The albums Bagarap Empires and Independence Park, and the documentary film Bougainville Sky are responses to his work with the peace monitoring mission. Around 2002 Smith wrote a number of songs for a female vocalist. He began a search for the right woman, and began working with the singer and double bass player Liz Frencham, forming Frencham Smith. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 2006, touring the USA presenting his songs and guest lectures in peace studies. and returned to Australia in late 2007 with an album of songs from that time entitled \\"Texas\\". While working in Uruzgan, he travelled with his guitar and entertained Afghanis as well as the Dutch and Australian troops stationed there. On his return to Australia from Afghanistan he released Dust of Uruzgan, an album of songs responding to the war in Afghanistan.

Life Ballard was born at Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire. Self-educated, Ballard taught himself Saxon while working in a habit-maker's shop, and attracted the attention of the Saxon scholar Elizabeth Elstob. Lord Chedworth and other local gentleman provided him with an annuity of £60 a year, enabling Ballard to move to Oxford to use the Bodleian Library. Dr. Jenner appointed him a clerk of Magdalen College, Oxford, and he subsequently became a university beadle. Ballard died young, and his only printed publication was Memoirs of several ladies of Great Britain, who have been celebrated for their writings, or skill in the learned languages, arts and sciences (1752). This quarto volume was published by subscription, and dedicated to Sarah Talbot of Kineton, the wife of the clergyman William Talbot of Kineton who had helped him receive patronage as a young man, and Mary Delany. The first woman treated by Ballard's Memoirs was Juliana of Norwich; the last was Constantia Grierson (1704/5–1732).

The president of Fisk University, located in Nashville, Tennessee, was Fayette McKenzie. McKenzie was accused of exercising a dictatorial rule on campus. He had discontinued the schools magazine and newspaper, canceled the baseball team and cut the football team's budget, and outlawed most extracurricular activities. All such activities were required to have a teacher chaperon. Women had a very strict dress code that they had to follow. Still, most black newspapers supported him because he spent several years raising a million dollar endowment fund for the University. He solicited funds from northern foundations, like the Rosenwald Fund and Rockefeller Foundation. These foundations wanted many African-American schools to abide by and teach the Jim Crow Laws and not try to challenge or reject them. In May 1924, a very angry W.E.B. Du Bois got on a train to go to his alma mater, Fisk University. His daughter was graduating that year. Hearing that he would be on campus, he was invited to give a speech to the graduating seniors. On June 2, 1924 in the University's chapel there was the president of the university, students, alumni and others in attendance. W. E. B. Du Bois attacked McKenzie with a speech, criticizing all the restrictions placed upon students. In particular, he decried McKenzie's practice of taking black female students down back alleys to sing in white men's clubs to raise money for the university. Throughout that summer and early fall, black newspapers debated what to do, with many continuing to support McKenzie and arguing that students needed discipline. In the fall, Du Bois ran several articles in The Crisis, the NAACP magazine that he edited, with direct information from conditions on campus from a student named George Streator. In November, the board of trustees arrived at campus for a visit. Streator organized a peaceful protest to demand that students and alumni be given a say in their college's governance. Due to the protest the board of trustees suggested that McKenzie make some compromises. McKenzie agreed initially to the recommended suggestions of the board of trustees, but eventually refused to cooperate with the student leaders. In December and January, McKenzie and Du Bois traveled around the country trying to bring support to their side of the debate. The opinions in black and white communities continued to be divided. In March, some of the male students again protested. They carried placards around the campus demanding change, but were peacefully in bed by eleven o'clock. McKenzie responded by calling in the all-white police to restore order. There were about eighty police officers that had riot guns who broke into and searched the men's dormitory. In particular, they were looking for six men on a list that McKenzie provided (those who signed the original protest the previous fall, including Streator). Most of these young men were not on campus, but regardless were named as the instigators in the \\"riot.\\" Those that were caught were taken to jail, but eventually released. The idea of brutal policemen descending on a peaceful campus was what finally changed public opinion, particularly through black newspaper coverage, in favor of the students. The students and Nashville community then organized a protest along with the community which lasted for 8 weeks, and included a boycott of the school. All the students went home rather than continuing the semester. McKenzie then resigned even though he still had the board of trustees' support. Thomas E. Jones, a white minister from the north, replaced him as President. Jones stayed for several decades before Charles S. Johnson became the first black president of Fisk in 1947. This confrontation between the students and the administrators was the first of several protests in black colleges over the next few years. Students demanded a greater role in administrative decisions, alumni representation on the board of trustees, and more personal freedom. At Howard University, an African-American president was elected as a result of these protests.

It is a not-for- profit house museum. Background Thomas Holy Suckley was a wealthy property developer in Manhattan. He was the son of devout Methodist George Suckley and his second wife Catherine Rutsen. George settled in New York City and became agent for the British mercantile establishment that would later become Holy, Newbould, & Suckley. He was well acquainted with most of the prominent Methodists of the time and active in supporting their ministry.\\"Suckley family papers (1791-1885)\\", Clements Library, University of Michigan Thomas Suckley's mother Catherine was the daughter of John Rutsen, whose maternal grandfather was Gilbert Livingston, son of Robert Livingston, Lord of Livingston Manor. John Rutsen was a close friend of Catherine Livingston Garrettson, the wife of the notable Methodist preacher, Freeborn Garrettson (1752 – 1827). In 1799, the Garrettsons purchased 160 acres in Rhinebeck, New York, where they established an estate called Wildercliff, and welcomed many circuit riding Methodist preachers. Frequent visitor Francis Asbury called it \\"Traveler's Rest\\".Tipple, Ezra S., Freeborn Garrettson, New York. Eaton & Mains. 1910, p. 74 Around 1850, the estate passed to their only child, Mary Rutherford Garrettson. History The Wilderstein property was originally part of the Wildercliff estate. In June 1853, Thomas Suckley, purchased from Mary Garrettson thirty-rwo acres of river-front property, which until then had served as a sheep meadow for the adjacent Wildercliff estate.\\"Wildercliff\\", Year Book Dutchess County Historical Society, vol. 17, 1932 (Mary Garrettson's mother Catherine was the granddaughter of Gilbert Livingston's older brother, Robert Livingston of Clermont). Suckley and his wife Catherine Murray Bowne chose the property as a building site for their mansion, because they considered the landscape a good match for their picturesque aesthetic ideal. The name \\"Wilderstein\\" (\\"wild stone\\" in German) was chosen by Suckley to allude to an American Indian petroglyph found nearby and reflect the site's historical significance.\\"History\\", Wilderstein Historic Site In total, three generations of the Suckley family inhabited the mansion. The last family member was Daisy Suckley, a cousin of Franklin D. Roosevelt for whom she trained his famous terrier Fala. Daisy Suckley died in the Wilderstein mansion in 1991,\\"Wilderstein Historic Site\\", National Park Service six months before her 100th birthday. The mansion is nine miles up-river, on the same side, from FDR's Hyde Park Home, Springwood. Description View of the Hudson River from Wilderstein The mansion commissioned for the site was a two-storey Italianate villa designed by architect John Warren Ritch. In 1888, Thomas Suckley's son Robert Bowne Suckley and his wife, Elizabeth Philips Montgomery, undertook a remodelling and enlargement of the house. This work was carried out by the local architect Arnout Cannon from Poughkeepsie. The style of the mansion was changed to a Queen Anne style country house. A third floor, a multi-gabled attic, a circular five-storey tower, a porte-cochère, and a verandah were added in the process. The new interior of the building was designed by Joseph Burr Tiffany, a cousin of Louis Comfort Tiffany. The rooms of ground floor were done in Historic Revival Style and in the aesthetic movement style using materials such as use mahogany, leather, stained glass, and linen. In parallel to the redesign of the mansion proper, the grounds of the estate were transformed by landscape architect Calvert Vaux according to the American Romantic Landscape style. Vaux's design comprised the creation of a network of drives and trails, the positioning of specimen trees and ornamental shrubs as well as the placement of an eclectic set of out buildings such as a carriage house, a gate lodge, and a potting shed. Gazebos and garden seats were positioned at carefully chosen vantage points. Preservation Daisy Suckley was instrumental in forming Wilderstein Preservation, a private non-profit organization. She opened the house to the public at Christmas 1984. The society is a recognized charity by the IRS; donations are tax deductible. Although little restoration work was carried out during her lifetime, responsible stewardship is becoming the norm now that concerned parties are supplying funds. For example, the tower was renovated in 1994, the main roof replaced in 1997, the siding on the second and third floor was restored in 2001, repairs on the porte-cochere and the north porch in 2002, and restoration work on the verandah in 2006.

East of the intersection, the road continued as Van Buren County Road V64 (CR V64) while Iowa 98 headed to the west. For the first of its routing, the two-lane highway ran parallel to and approximately from the Des Moines River. The highway then turned to the north and crossed the river. On the northern banks, it entered Douds, which is also a CDP. Douds sprawls for , despite only having a population of 152 in the 2010 Census. Iowa 98 continued north for another until it reached Iowa 16\\\\. North of the intersection, the road continued again as CR V64. The entire route had an annual average daily traffic of 1060 vehicles. History There have been two iterations of Iowa 98, both of which have been intricately linked with Iowa 16\\\\. The first version of Iowa 98, Primary Road No. 98, was created with the primary road system in 1920. It was a spur route which connected Eldon to Primary Road No. 8, which later became U.S. Highway 34. In early 1936, Iowa 98 was extended to Selma on a road that crossed the Des Moines River twice, at Eldon and at Selma. The next year, that stretch of road was replaced by another that did not cross the river. In early 1933, Iowa 16 was extended west from Iowa 1 near Birmingham to Douds. Eleven years later, Iowa 16 and Iowa 98 were connected. Iowa 16 took over all of the former Iowa 98 through Selma and Eldon, while the second version of Iowa 98 was designated over the short spur to Douds. In 1953, Iowa 98 was extended south over the Des Moines River to Leando.. On December 28, 2017, the Iowa Department of Transportation transferred Iowa 98 to the Van Buren County Secondary Roads Department. To cover the cost of maintenance, the DOT paid $2.31 million to the county.

His works, which are videos which can be downloaded from video- sharing sites such as YouTube, and freely distributed by his permission, are viewed by millions. His outrageous humour and his use of innumerable parodies had gained a degree of international attention and drew notices from the Communist Party's Department of Propaganda. He has since directed a number of hugely popular online commercials for companies such as 7Up and McDonald's.http://www.chinasmack.com/2011/videos/hu-ge-interview-parodying- chinese-society-and-viral-advertising.html Biography Hu Ge grew up in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Hu Ge became well known by Chinese netizens after his first short movie, A Murder Case Caused by a Bun (a spoof on Chen Kaige's The Promise), in late 2005. His subsequent works have also been well received.  Techniques  Hu Ge focuses on enhancements through satire in social and cultural realms, reflecting numerous problems in Chinese society to a backdrop of loosely pieced together current events or well-known footage from big-name films, including Harry Potter, The Matrix, Shaolin Soccer, Hero, etc. He has immense focus on elements of parody on multiple levels. The music he uses are usually satirical, be it Chinese instrumentals, Hollywood movie soundtracks, American pop songs or spinoffs of Michael Jackson songs.  Public and official response  Hu Ge's films, which are distributed freely on the Internet, received widespread attention on Chinese video-sharing networks, beating Huang Jianxiang's crazy commentary at the World Cup in Germany (because of the large number of networks the statistics are inconclusive). In January 2006, after the popularizing of Hu's first creation, A Murder Case caused by a Mantou, Chen Kaige, director of The Promise and subject of Hu's satire, announced plans to take legal action against Hu for apparent copyright violations and defamation. The amateur films became the discussion topics on various Chinese forums, and received overwhelming support from the general public, which led to bad social repercussion against Chen, who later dropped the lawsuit. In late 2006, because of its subtle social commentary that could be interpreted at a political level, Hu's films gained the attention to the Communist Party's Propaganda Department, in charge of China's media controls. There were talks of a ban in late 2006, with the pretext that Hu's films are too long and too intricate in design, that they can no longer be categorized as amateur Internet videos. In early 2007, however, after Hu's newest release, 007 vs. Man in Black, there are no signs of a ban.

Plot introduction The novel revolves around the near extinction of humanity by an artificial prion originally designed to help the mentally ill but which becomes a shamanistic pandemic of madness, shape- shifting and death. There are 2 plots-lines which each follow the same set of characters before and after this near extinction. =Explanation of the novel's title= The title of the novel comes from both the correlation between the pandemic's symptoms and the full moon, and that the pandemic effectively emptied the cities. Plot summary The novel opens in 1999 with a car accident occurring in parallel universes. In Universe A, the universe in which Hendrix's previous novel Better Angels occurs, the accident is avoided allowing 3 of the major characters in that novel to be born. However, in Universe A Prime the accident does occur and the resulting deaths prevent those characters from being born. The 3 characters are brothers Jiro and Seiji Ansel Yamaguchi, and their cousin John Drinan. Years later in 2032 the process of Jiro's transcendence, which occurs at the end of Better Angels, results in John being thrown from Universe A to Universe A Prime. Empty Cities of the Full Moon takes place in Universe A Prime after this. =Year 2032 (pre-human extinction)= When John is thrown between universes he quickly discovers that there is no record of his existence. The trauma of this event causes John to lose himself in depression. After meeting Mark Fornash, John en-rolls himself in a clinical trial of an experimental artificial prion based cure for mental illness, created by Tomoko Fukuda. Soon a drumming and dancing mania begins to sweep the globe, causing a large and increasing portion of the population to drop out of their societies. Due to his interest in shamanism Mark Fornash is the first person to recognize the manias as a single phenomenon patterned after shamanistic practises, and to predict it progression from drumming and dancing to visions, shape-shifting, soul-flying and death. The story follows the progress of the disease through the view points of these characters, as well as: Simon Lingham, ex-husband of Tokomo, and World Health Organization investigator; Sister Vena, a nun in Calcuta who observes extreme stigmata in patients in last stages of the pandemic; Leira Losaba, a police lieutenant in Johannesburg who investigates a series of murders involving shape-shifted people; Cameron Spires, one of the survivors of the car accident at the beginning of the novel, an eccentric billionaire with interests in human longevity and long-term survival. As the pandemic progresses Cameron eventually organizes a conference to pool research, which brings all of the major character together. The pandemic appears to be related to the Tokomo's prion's, but the extreme effects can not be explained. As madness and death consume the world, Cameron uses his enormous wealth to create a bolt-hole in the Bahamas and to bring all of the major characters to safety. However, before Cameron departs to his island he holds a final tele-conference with some powerful allies, who have died but been recorded in a powerful computer system. This system is the \\"Gödelian Non-standard Optimized Market Evolution Systems\\" or GNOMES. This organization Tetragammaton and these characters (Dr. Vang, Michael Dalke, and Martin Kong) have appeared in previous Hendrix novels involved in the long-term survival of humanity through the creation of mind- machine interfaces. This conversation reveals that Tetragammaton, was involved in the creation of the pandemic but that it has gone out of control. Dalke and Kong claim that the GNOMES were ultimately responsible for creating the pandemic as a complete defence against extinction and by orders of mysterious entity the Allesseh. The Allesseh is a massive consciousness at the centre of the galaxy, described in Hendrix's novel Better Angels. =Year 2065 (post- human extinction)= The pandemic has resulted in the near-extinction of humanity. Some of the survivors were fully resistant to the pandemic and have remained human, called Oldfolk or Urfolk, and some were partially resistant have become Werfolk having some of the madness, drumming, dancing, and shape shifting of the pandemic. Over the past 30 years Cameron Spires has perfected a longevity treatment, created a dolphin-human hybrid species called the Merfolk, kept the islands strictly isolated from the Werfolk, prevented further research into the pandemic and maintained himself as the unquestioned 'founder-ruler'. This has driven all of the major characters, except Simon Lingham, back to the mainland in search of answers. Simon Lingham, leaves for the same reasons soon after the story begins. Cameron's granddaughter Trillia Spires and her lover Ricardo, soon follow him when Ricardo is found to have signs of the plague, and exiled per Cameron's rules. They hope to catch up with Simon in New York City and to discover a cure for Ricardo. Their journey takes them up the American east coast, encountering all of the major characters of the novel who are each dealing with the post-pandemic world in their own ways. Each character, except Leire who has become a Werfolk-hating warlord, either joins the group or offers some aid. By the time the group reaches New York, Ricardo's symptoms are entering the final stages of the pandemic. Ricardo's plague induced vision lead them to where Simon has connected himself to GNOMES. Simon is learning from and changing the GNOMES. He reveals Cameron's involvement in not preventing the plague, and Cameron arrives with a security team, claiming that he engineered the plague so that he could re-make humanity in his image. However, Ricardo dies and transcends during this conflict preparing the way for John to return to his universe and transmitting full knowledge of the works of the pandemic to every human on the planet. This final knowledge will allow the three types of human, Urfolk, Werfolk, and Merfolk, to choose their own destinies and control the effects of the pandemic. The group exiles Cameron and returns to the Bahamas to begin the process of re-building their world.

A Democrat, Roy is the son of Christopher Roy, Sr., an ad hoc judge of the Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal. He is the brother of Christopher Roy, Jr., a former one-term member of the Louisiana House of Representatives and a 2014 candidate for district attorney of the 9th Judicial District Court, based in Alexandria. Roy graduated in 1988 from Holy Savior Menard Central High School, the Roman Catholic secondary institution in Alexandria. Prior to his having been elected mayor, Roy practiced law with his brother Chris, Jr., in Alexandria. His father, Chris Roy, Sr., was formerly affiliated with the firm of the legendary Alexandria lawyer Camille Gravel. Roy attended Louisiana State University, at which he majored in Political Science, with concentration in American government and politics, and Southern University Law Center, both in Baton Rouge. In 1995, Roy married the former Wendy Hendrix (born February 26, 1972), formerly of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. They have a daughter and a son.  Election history  Roy announced his candidacy for mayor during the first week of August 2006, the fifth of seven candidates to step forward. He campaigned on the issues of smart growth, government transparency, and inclusiveness. On September 20 that year, Roy finished in first place in the nonpartisan blanket primary, having received over 33 percent of the vote. Delores Brewer, a Republican and chief of staff to outgoing Democratic Mayor Ned Randolph, finished in second place by a margin of only seventeen votes over Roy's fellow Democrat and Alexandria City Councilman-at-large, Roosevelt Johnson, an African American. Although both Roy and Brewer promised to stay positive during the general election, Brewer quickly went on the offensive. She launched two highly controversial television commercials, one of which was covered nationally. On November 7, 2006, Roy was elected by a landslide. He captured 76 percent of the vote. In 2010, Roy easily won re-election in the primary, winning more thean 63 percent of the vote in a crowded field. In his bid for a third term as mayor in the primary election on November 4, 2014, Roy faced Jamar Gailes, Jeff Hall, Mitzi \\"Gibson\\" LaSalle, and Nicholas R. P. Wright. Roy was considered a potential Democratic candidate in 2016 for the United States Senate seat vacated by Republican David Vitter, who failed in a bid for governor in 2015. Roy never filed for the race, and victory went to Democrat-turned-Republican John N. Kennedy, the former state treasurer.  Accomplishments  During his first term, Roy launched the S.P.A.R.C. (Special Planned Activity Redevelopment Corridors) Initiative, the largest redevelopment program in the city's history. Economist Donovan Rypkema believes S.P.A.R.C. is the \\"right\\" kind of \\"stimulus project,\\" and renowned architect Frederic Schwartz considers S.P.A.R.C. to be \\"the most concise vision\\" for revitalization in the country. Veteran Mayor Joseph Riley of Charleston, South Carolina, has also praised Roy's vision and his leadership. \\"Show me a community with real inventive, aggressive, thoughtful, creative leadership (like Roy), and I will show you a community on the move,\\" Riley told Alexandria Town Talk. Roy created Alexandria's first-ever diversity program, Diversity in Action, which he referenced in his first inaugural address. \\"Diversity works; inclusiveness makes money; community-based planning positively affects cities,\\" Roy said. As a result of his initiative, Roy has significantly increased the number of small, emerging, minority, and/or women- owned businesses that work with the city of Alexandria. During his first term, Roy ordered a comprehensive audit of the Alexandria Police Department, which was conducted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Roy is a proponent of community policing and Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) strategies. Gregory Saville, co-founder of the International CPTED Association, wrote in an article titled \\"Uptapping Kinetic Energy: Civic Potential Under the Surface\\": \\"... I met one of those rare leaders committed to making that kinetic energy work - re-elected Mayor Jaques Roy. He absolutely got what SafeGrowth can mean in his community. He is also just the quality of civic leader to muster the community energy to make it happen.\\" On July 15, 2013, Roy was among nine mayors who established Social Media Giving Day to encourage citizens to support charities via social media.http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/hey-put-your- twitter-where-your-mouth-is/ Roy was involved with the Louisiana Municipal Association. He co-chaired Louisiana's first-ever World Cultural Economic Forum, which was spearheaded by then Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans. Landrieu's sister, U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu, considers Roy among the nation's leading advocates for smart growth: \\"He's been one of the most outstanding mayors in our whole state and actually our whole country on this issue,\\" she told KALB-TV in Alexandria.

Thompson- Chief Operating Officer Joseph Page- Chief of Policy and Planning/Chief Diversity Officer Bill Hess- Chief of Economic Development Charles Johnson - City Attorney Vacant- Deputy Chief Operating Officer/Police Commissioner/Director of Public Works Stepping down Mayor Roy did not seek a fourth term in the nonpartisan blanket primary on November 6, 2018, and finished his term in December 2018. Jeff Hall, who lost to Roy in 2014, and the next year became a state representative, again ran for mayor on \\"a pro- business, pro-people platform that brings jobs back, grows existing businesses, and makes city government something that actually works.

He was professor of Greek at Brown University, and helped found the American Philological Association and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Early life Harkness was born in Mendon, Massachusetts and attended Uxbridge High School and Worcester Academy. He graduated from Brown University in 1842. He was senior master of Providence High School from 1846-1853, and pursued studies in Germany at the universities of Berlin, Bonn, and Göttingen. Harkness was the first American to obtain a degree from Bonn (Ph.D., 1854). Career In 1855, he was appointed professor of Greek in Brown University, a position he held until his retirement in 1892. He visited Europe in 1870 and 1883 and there investigated educational questions, in particular the methods of German and English universities. He assisted in founding the American Philological Association, of which he was a first vice president in 1869-18770 and president in 1875-1876. As a member of the Archæological Institute of America, he was appointed in 1881 to the committee on the expediency of establishing an American School of Classical Studies at Athens, an institution which was opened in 1882. In 1884, he was elected director of the school. In 1869, he received the degree of LL.D. from Brown University. He lectured extensively before learned societies, contributed valuable papers on original researches in philology to the Transactions of the American Philological Association, and from 1851 published a series of textbooks in Latin studies, of which it may be said that from them dated the beginning of a new era in the Latin department of classical studies in America. Death Harkness died in Providence, Rhode Island on May 27, 1907. Family life Harkness was the son of Southwick and Phebe (Thayer) Harkness. On May 28, 1849 Harkness married Maria Aldrich Smith.

Felice de Giardini (12 April 1716 – 8 June 1796) was an Italian composer and violinist. Early life Felice Giardini was born in Turin. When it became clear that he was a child prodigy, his father sent him to Milan. There he studied singing, harpsichord and violin but it was on the latter that he became a famous virtuoso. By the age of 12, he was already playing in theatre orchestras. In a famous incident about this time, Giardini, who was serving as assistant concertmaster (i.e. leader of the orchestra) during an opera, played a solo passage for violin which the composer Niccolò Jommelli had written. He decided to show off his skills and improvised several bravura variations which Jommelli had not written. Although the audience applauded loudly, Jommelli, who happened to be there, was not pleased and suddenly stood up and slapped the young man in the face. Giardini, years later, remarked, \\"it was the most instructive lesson I ever received from a great artist.\\" In London During the 1750s, Giardini toured Europe as a violinist, scoring successes in Paris, Berlin, and especially in England, where he eventually settled. For many years, he served as the orchestra leader and director of the Italian Opera in London and gave solo concerts under the auspices of J. C. Bach with whom he was a close friend. He directed the orchestra at the London Pantheon.Oxford DNB. From the mid-1750s to the end of the 1760s, he was widely regarded as the greatest musical performing artist before the public. His identity with the Signor Giardini, who in 1774 sought with Dr Charles Burney to form a public music school associated with the Foundling Hospital is uncertain. In 1784, he returned to Naples to run a theatre, but encountered financial setbacks. In 1793, he returned to England to try his luck. But times had changed, and he was no longer remembered. He then went to Russia, but again had little luck, dying in Moscow in 1796. Compositions Giardini was a prolific composer, writing for virtually every genre which then existed. His two main areas, however, were opera and chamber music. Virtually all of his music is out of print with the exception of a few songs and works of chamber music. As a string player, he knew how to make string instruments sound their best. His chamber music combines the so-called Style Galant with the mid-18th-century classicism of J.C. Bach, the Stamitzes and the Mannheim school. In the Style Galant, the writing emphasises the soloistic qualities of the instruments, rather than integrated part-writing, to create a whole. Giardini, although he did write string quartets and quartets for other instruments – a new and evolving form at the time – concentrated on writing trios, primarily those for violin, viola and cello, of which he wrote at least 18. Giardini is known among Protestant churches for his \\"Italian Hymn\\" or \\"Moscow\\", which often accompanies the text to the hymn \\"Come, Thou Almighty King\\" and also John Marriott's hymn \\"Thou whose almighty word\\".It may be found in these hymnals and many others (hymnary.org lists 192 instances of it): Celebrating Grace, hymn number 2, 2010 Celebrating Grace, Inc., Macon, GA; Baptist Hymnal (1991), hymn number 247, 1991 Convention Press, Nashville, TN; The United Methodist Hymnal, hymn number 61, 1989 The United Methodist Publishing House, Nashville, TN; The Celebration Hymnal, hymn number 8, 1997 Word/Integrity, Nashville, TN/Mobile, AL; Hymnal 1982, hymn number 365, 1982 The Church Hymnal Corporation, New York, NY.

The route begins at the eastern city limit of Montezuma and ends at Iowa 21 east of Deep River. Created in 1920 as a spur route connecting What Cheer to Primary Road No. 2, it is an original route in the Iowa primary highway system. In the early 1930s, the route was extended north to Deep River and west to Montezuma. By the end of the decade, Iowa 21 had taken over the north–south portion of the route. Except for both endpoints shifting slightly, Iowa 85 has largely stayed the same since the 1930s. Route description Iowa 85 begins at the eastern city limit of Montezuma. It heads east through the rolling farmland of Poweshiek County. Near the midpoint of the route, it intersects County Road V18 (CR V18). As it approaches Deep River, the route briefly curves to the north-northeast before turning to the southeast. The terrain becomes hillier as the route crosses a creek leading to the eponymous river just north of Deep River. On the south side of Deep River, Iowa 85 turns back to the east. It ends east of Deep River at an intersection with Iowa 21. History Primary Road No. 85 was created in 1920 with the advent of Iowa's primary highway system. At the time, it was a short spur route connecting What Cheer to Primary Road No. 2 in Keokuk County. In 1931, Iowa 85 was significantly lengthened north to Deep River and west to US 63 in Montezuma. In 1939, the route was shortened to its east–west section between Montezuma and Deep River as Iowa 21 was extended and it supplanted Iowa 85 south of Deep River. Iowa 85 was paved in the mid-1950s; until then, the highway had been a gravel road. In the early 1960s, Iowa 21 was straightened through Keokuk County near Guernsey and Deep River. This caused the eastern end of Iowa 85 to move east back to the point where it had turned into an east–west route in the 1930s. The route would remain this way for nearly thirty years. In 1994, the westernmost of Iowa 85 was turned over to the City of Montezuma. The route now begins at the eastern city limits. Along US 63, signs at the former intersection of Iowa 85 now say \\"To Iowa 85\\".

It is very similar to the seal of his brother, Alexander I of Scotland. The relationship between the Kingdom of England and King David I, who was King of Scotland between 1124 and 1153, was partly shaped by David's relationship with the particular King of England, and partly by David's own ambition. David had a good relationship with and was an ally of Henry I of England, the King who was largely responsible for David's early career. After Henry's death, David upheld his support for his niece, the former Empress- consort, Matilda, and expanded his power in northern England in the process, despite his defeat at the Battle of the Standard in 1138. Overview David's relationship with England and the English crown in these years is usually interpreted in either or both of two ways. Firstly, his actions are understood in relation to his connections with the King of England. No historian is likely to deny that David's early career was largely manufactured for him by King Henry I of England. David was the latter's \\"greatest protégé\\",Oram, Lordship of Galloway, pp. 59, 63. one of Henry's \\"new men\\",Kapelle, Norman Conquest, pp. 202-3. Henry's influence had brought David his English marriage and lands, and Henry's military power had allowed David to take up his Scottish lands. David's early career can be understood as part of Henry's frontier policy, which included marriage of two daughters to the kings of Scotland and Galloway, consolidation of royal control in the north-west coast of England and the quelling of the Montgomeries, marcher lords on the Welsh borders who had been allied to Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (1101–19).Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 59 et passim. The world of peace which David had enjoyed in England ended after the death of Henry I, just as it did for most other English magnates. His hostility to Stephen can be interpreted as an effort to uphold the intended inheritance of Henry I, the succession of his daughter, the former empress-consort Matilda. David indeed carried out his wars in her name, joined her when she arrived in England, and later knighted her son, the future Henry II.Stringer, Reign of Stephen, 28-37; Stringer, \\"State-Building in Twelfth-Century Britain\\", pp. 40-62; Green, \\"Anglo-Scottish Relations,\\" pp. 53-72; Kapelle, Norman Conquest of the North, pp. 141ff; Blanchard, \\"Lothian and Beyond\\", pp. 23-46. However, David's policy towards England can be interpreted another way. David is the independence- loving king trying to build a \\"Scoto-Northumbrian\\" realm by seizing the most northerly parts of the English kingdom. In this perspective, David's support for Matilda is used as a pretext for land grabbing. David's maternal descent from the House of Wessex and his son Henry's maternal descent from the Saxon earls of Northumberland is thought to have further encouraged such a project, a project which only came to an end after Henry II ordered David's child successor Máel Coluim IV to hand over the most important of David's gains. It is clear that neither one of these interpretations can be taken without some weight being given to the other.Most historians take this view to some extent, including Stringer, Kapelle, Green and Blanchard (see previous note); the quest for a \\"Scoto-Northumbrian realm is stressed in Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 121-44, 167-89. Usurpation of Stephen and 1st Treaty of Durham Stephen, King of the English, or Étienne de Blois in French. It was Stephen's \\"usurpation\\" that David used as \\"an excuse\\" for warring with England, if it was not the actual reason. Henry I had arranged his inheritance to pass to his daughter Matilda, but the latter's support amongst the English and Norman magnates and barons was compromised by her marriage to Geoffrey V, count of Anjou, as the Angevins were the traditional rivals of the Normans. Instead Stephen, younger brother of Theobald, count of Blois, seized the throne.M.T. Clancy, England and its Rulers, (Malden, MA, 1998), pp. 84-5; Robert Bartlett, England under the Norman and Angevin Kings, 1075-1225, (Oxford, 2000), p. 10. David however had been the first lay person to take the oath to uphold the succession of Matilda in 1127, and when Stephen was crowned on 22 December, David decided to make war.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 121-3. Before December was over, David marched into northern England, and by the end of January he had occupied the castles of Carlisle, Wark, Alnwick, Norham and Newcastle. By February David was at Durham, but was met there by an army assembled and led by King Stephen. However, rather than fight a pitched battle, a treaty was agreed whereby David would retain Carlisle while David's son Henry was re-granted the title and half the lands of the earldom of Huntingdon, which had been confiscated during David's revolt, as well as the lordship of Doncaster. On Stephen's side he received back the other castles; and while David himself would do no homage, Stephen was to receive the homage of Henry for both Carlisle and the other English territories. Stephen also gave the rather worthless but for David face-saving promise that if he ever chose to resurrect the defunct earldom of Northumberland, Henry would be given first consideration. Importantly, the issue of Matilda was not mentioned. However, the first Durham treaty quickly broke down after David took insult at the treatment of his son Henry at Stephen's court.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 122-5. Renewal of war and Clitheroe Scottish atrocities depicted on the 14th century Luttrell Psalter. When the winter of 1136-37 was over, David once again invaded England. The King of Scots confronted a northern English army waiting for him at Newcastle. Once again, pitched battle was avoided, and a truce agreed until November. Charter evidence shows that David had gathered in Strathclyde the four most powerful magnates in Scotland, William fitz Duncan, now lord of Moray, Máel Ísu, mormaer of Strathearn, Donnchad, mormaer of Fife and Fergus, king of Galloway, along with lesser figures such as \\"Dufoter\\" of Callendar, Máel Domnaich of Scone and Gillebrígte of Stirling, probably the toísechs or \\"thanes\\" of their respective royal demesne locations.Lawrie, Early Scottish Charters, no. x. Such a huge gathering could only have been made for a military campaign. When November fell, David demanded that Stephen hand over the whole of the old earldom of Northumberland. Stephen's predictable refusal led to David's third invasion, this time in January 1138.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 126-7. David advanced into the English lands taking blackmail payments from settlements and establishments that paid and plundering and burning those that did not. The army which invaded England in the January and February 1138 shocked the English chroniclers, and the shock was compounded even more by the fact that it was led by \\"their\\" David.Michael Lynch, in his single-volume Scotland: A New History, explains the initial hatred displayed in the northern English chroniclers not in terms of the brutality shown during David’s invasions of northern England, but in terms of what might be called cultural treason. Michael Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 83; R. R. Davies, First English Empire, p. 11, offers a slightly different, but not incompatible, explanation: \\"The outrage with which the contemporary chronicles responded to what they termed the barbarism of the Scots…is surely to be explained in part by the shock of the Anglo-Normans on realizing that their economic and cultural superiority and civility as well as their military dominance were being challenged for the first time in three generations. Empire-builders are distressed by challenges to their right to build empires\\". Richard of Hexham called it \\"an execrable army, savager than any race of heathen yielding honour to neither God nor man\\" and that it \\"harried the whole province and slaughtered everywhere folk of either sex, of every age and condition, destroying, pillaging and burning the vills, churches and houses\\". Several doubtful stories of cannibalism entered the chronicle records.e.g. accounts of Richard of Hexham and Ailred of Rievaulx in A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 180, & n. 4. as well as routine enslavings and killings of churchmen, women and infants.e.g. Richard of Hexham, John of Worcester and John of Hexham at A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 181. Henry of Huntingdon wrote that the Scots: > “cleft open pregnant women, and took out the unborn babes; they tossed > children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the > head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed > the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, > all was full of horror and full of savagery”.A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, > p. 179. By February, King Stephen had mustered an army which marched north to deal with David. The two armies avoided each other, and Stephen was soon on the road back into the south. In the summer, David split his army into two forces, sending William fitz Duncan to march into Lancashire, where he harried Furness and Craven. On 10 June, William fitz Duncan was met by force of knights and men-at-arms. A pitched battle took place, the battle of Clitheroe, and the result was that the English army was routed.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 132-3. Battle of the Standard By later July the two Scottish armies had reunited on the far side of the river Tyne in \\"St Cuthbert's land\\", that is, in the lands controlled by the Bishop of Durham. Another English army had mustered to meet the Scots, led by William, Earl of Aumale. The victory at Clitheroe was probably what inspired David to risk battle. David's force, apparently 26,000 strong and several times larger than the English army, met the English on 22 August on Cowdon Moor near Northallerton, North Yorkshire.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 136-7; A. O. Anderson, Early Sources, p. 190. Many of David's Norman vassals abandoned him at this point, perhaps shocked by the king's huge \\"barbarian\\" army, but more likely compromised by dual loyalty to King Stephen and David. Robert de Brus and Bernard de Balliol, two of these men, approached the king's camp and tried to plead with him. According to Ailred of Rievaulx, Robert de Brus protested to David, > \\"Against whom today dost thou bear arms today and lead this huge army? > Against the English, truly, and the Normans. O King, are not these they with > whom, thou hast ever found useful counsel and ready help, and willing > obedience besides? Since when, my lord, I ask thee hast thou found such > faith in Scots that thou dost with such confidence divest and deprive > thyself and thine of the counsel of the English, and the help of the > Normans, as if the Scots would suffice alone for thee even against the > Scots? New to thee is this confidence in Galwegians, attacking with arms > today those by whose aid hitherto thou hast ruled the Scots with affection > [and] the Galwegians with terror\\".A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 193. According to the sources a dispute erupted in among David's army about who would fill the front line. The decision by David to put his small French contingent in the front line was resented by the \\"Galwegians\\", perhaps a term used for Gaels from Scotland south of the Forth rather than just from Galloway.A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 198, n. 2. Ailred of Rievaulx reports that the protests were led by Máel Ísu, mormaer of Strathearn, reportedly saying to the king \\"why is it, O King, that thou reliest rather upon the will of Galli, since none of them with their arms today will advance before me, unarmed in the battle?\\",A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 199; Galli is Ailred's Latin rendering of the Gaelic word Gall, which means \\"foreigner\\", see A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 180, n. 4. and the Scots pointed out that already \\"\\"we gained at Clitheroe a victory over mail-clad men\\" in an effort to convince David of their better worthiness.A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 199. Despite the protests of David's Norman followers, David apparently had to yield, and he gave the Galwegians the honour of filing the front of the four Scottish lines. Behind the Galwegians were the men from David's former principality in southern Scotland, led by Prince Henry and David's Northumbrian ally Eustace fitz John. The third line was taken by the Hebrideans, Argyllmen and men of Lothian, and the forth and biggest line was taken up by the men of Scotland-proper, with David in personal command.A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 199-200 The English on the other hand were massed into one dense column around a detached ship's mast topped with religious banners, giving to the battle its most famous name, i.e. \\"the battle of the Standard\\".Account by Richard of Hexham - A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 200-01; Ailred of Rievaulx - A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 201-2. The battle soon got underway. Henry of Huntingdon tells us that \\"the Scots cried out the warcry of their fathers - and the shout rose even to the skies - Albanaich, Albanaich!\\" and charged the massed Anglo-Norman line.A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 202. The cry, meaning \\"Men of Scotland\\", had been used by the Scots at the battle of Corbridge in 908.Michael Lynch, Scotland: A New History, (Edinburgh, 1991), p. 53. Ailred described the same charge, saying that the first line > \\"after their custom gave vent thrice to a yell of horrible sound, and > attacked the southerns in such an onslaught that they compelled the first > spearmen to forsake their post; but they were driven off again by the > strength of the knights, and [the spearmen] recovered their courage and > strength against the foe. And when the frailty of the Scottish lances was > mocked by the denseness of iron and wood they drew their swords and > attempted to contend at close quarters\\" As the Scots were engaging in this close combat, Ailred tells us that the English archers began to fire on the Scottish line, causing extreme disarray and lose of life. The suicidal bravery and endurance of the Galwegians, and the lack of Norman-style armour which Máel Ísu and the Scots had allegedly been so boastful of, was mocked by Ailred: > \\"like a hedgehog with its quill, so would you see a Galwegian bristling all > round with arrows, and none theless brandishing his sword, and in blind > madness rushing forward now smite a foe, now lash the air with useless > stokes\\".A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 203. Despite this attack, the battle continued. Ailred tells us the force of David's son Henry managed to route its opponents.A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 204 According to Henry of Huntingdon, though, the battle turned when the \\"chief of the men of Lothian\\", probably Cospatric II, earl of Dunbar, was struck by an arrow. The men of Lothian apparently fled first; and after a while, Ailred tells us the Galwegians followed suit when Domnall and Ulgric, two of their captains, were slain.A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 204. John of Hexham tells us that the battle lasted three hours. 2nd Treaty of Durham Carlisle Castle was rebuilt by King David, and became one of his chief residences. After the battle, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although the result was a defeat, it was not by any means a decisive nor even devastating defeat. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued to go on until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland and much of Northumberland. On 26 September Cardinal Alberic of Ostia arrived at Carlisle where David had called together his kingdom's nobles, abbots and bishops. Alberic was there to investigate the controversy over the issue of the bishop of Glasgow's allegiance or non-allegiance to the archbishop of York. However, Alberic also played a role as peace-broker. With Alberic acting as a go- between, David agreed to a six-week truce which excluded the siege of Wark. Negotiations between David and Stephen continued over the winter months, but on 9 April David and Stephen's wife Matilda of Boulogne met each other at Durham and agreed a settlement. David's son Henry was given the earldom of Northumberland and was restored to the earldom of Huntingdon and lordship of Doncaster; David himself was allowed to keep Carlisle and Cumberland. However, King Stephen was to retain possession of the strategically vital castles of Bamburgh and Newcastle, and Prince Henry was to perform homage for his English lands, while David himself was to promise to \\"remain loyal\\" to Stephen at all times. The last conditions aside, this effectively fulfilled all of David's war aims. Thus, despite the surprising victory of the outnumbered English army in North Yorkshire, the series of invasions that David led into England since the death of his patron Henry at the end of 1135 had resulted in a significantly expanded kingdom. David, moreover, was no longer in practice a sub-king. So if King Henry's life and reign had brought David all his fortune, Henry's death had brought David even more.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 140-4. Arrival of Matilda and the renewal of conflict The settlement with Stephen was not set to last long. The arrival in England of the Empress Matilda, claimant to the English throne, gave David an opportunity to renew the conflict with Stephen. When Stephen was captured by the Matilda's forces on 2 February 1141, David finally decided to disregard his agreement with Stephen and seek the support of Matilda. In either May or June, David travelled to the south of England to enter Matilda's company, and was present for her expected but aborted coronation at Westminster Abbey. David was there until September when the Empress found herself surrounded at Winchester. This civil war, or \\"the Anarchy\\" as it was later called, enabled David to strengthen his own position in northern England. While David consolidated his hold on his own and his son's newly acquired lands, he also sought to expand his influence. The castles at Newcastle and Bamburgh were again brought under his control, and he attained dominion over all of England north-west of the River Ribble and Pennines, while holding the north-east as far south as the River Tyne, on the borders of the core territory of the bishopric of Durham. While his son brought all the senior barons of Northumberland into his entourage, David rebuilt the fortress of Carlisle. Carlisle quickly began replacing Roxburgh as his favoured residence. David's acquisition of the mines at Alston on the South Tyne enabled him to begin minting the Kingdom of Scotland's first silver coinage. David, meanwhile, issued charters to Shrewsbury Abbey in respect to their lands in Lancashire.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 179. Bishopric of Durham and the Archbishopric of York However, David's successes were in many ways balanced by his failures. David's greatest disappointment during this time was his inability to ensure control of the bishopric of Durham and the archbishopric of York. David had attempted to appoint his chancellor, William Comyn, to the bishopric of Durham, which had been vacant since the death of Bishop Geoffrey in 1140. Between 1141 and 1143, Comyn was the de facto bishop, and had control of the bishop's castle; but he was resented by the chapter. Despite controlling the town of Durham, David's only hope of ensuring his election and consecration was gaining the support of the Papal legate, Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen. Despite obtaining the support of the Empress Matilda, David was unsuccessful and had given up by the time William de St Barbara was elected to the see in 1143. David also attempted to interfere in the succession to the archbishopric of York. William FitzHerbert, nephew of King Stephen, found his position undermined by the collapsing political fortune of Stephen in the north of England, and was deposed by the pope. David used his Cistercian connections to build a bond with Henry Murdac, the new archbishop. Despite the support of Pope Eugenius III, supporters of King Stephen and William FitzHerbert managed to prevent Henry taking up his post at York. By 1149, Henry had sought the support of David. David seized on the opportunity to bring the archdiocese under Scottish control, and marched on the city. However, Stephen's supporters had gotten wind of the plan, and informed King Stephen. Stephen therefore marched to the city and installed a new garrison. David decided not to risk such an engagement and withdrew.For David's struggle for control over Durham see Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 169-75, for York, see pp. 186-9. Richard Oram has conjectured that David's ultimate aim was to bring the whole of the ancient kingdom of Northumbria into his dominion. For Oram, this event was the turning point, \\"the chance to radically redraw the political map of the British Isles lost forever\\".Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 189.

He studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow. He contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine under the pseudonym Crito, was a well-known poet, and wrote in 1754 a celebration of British women poets, the Feminead. He was married to the poet Susanna Duncombe. Life Duncombe was born in London on 29 September 1729, the only child of the author and playwright William Duncombe and his wife Elizabeth Hughes. He was educated at two schools in Essex, before entering, on 1 July 1745, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he proceeded B.A. in 1748 and M.A. in 1752. He was later elected a fellow of his college, and in 1753 was ordained at Kew Chapel by John Thomas, the bishop of Peterborough. On the recommendation of Archbishop Thomas Herring, he was appointed to the curacy of Sundridge in Kent. Duncombe subsequently became assistant-preacher at St Anne's Church, Soho. He was in succession chaplain to Samuel Squire, bishop of St David's, and to John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork. In 1757 Archbishop Herring, a friend, presented him to the united livings of St Andrew and St Mary Bredan, in Canterbury. He was later made one of the Six Preachers in the cathedral; and in 1773 obtained from Archbishop Frederick Cornwallis the living of Herne, near Canterbury. The archbishop also appointed him master of St John's Hospital, Canterbury, and gave him a chaplaincy, which enabled him to hold his two livings. Duncombe died at Canterbury 19 January 1786 and was buried there. Personal life In 1761 Duncombe married Susanna Highmore, a childhood friend, and a poet and artist in her own right. She and an only daughter survived him. Works Among Duncombe's many poems, the best known were: * An Evening's Contemplation in a College, a parody of Thomas Gray's Elegy in a Country Churchyard (1753) * The Feminead (1754) * Translations from Horace (1766–67). He wrote numerous occasional pieces, such as On a Lady sending the Author a Ribbon for his Watch.For a full list see Gentleman's Magazine, June 1786, pp. 451–2, and Biographia Britannica ed. Andrew Kippis, iv. 511.

McCarthy (July 2, 1919 - November 19, 1998) was an American labor leader and official in the Teamsters. He was appointed president of the Teamsters on July 18, 1988, defeating interim president Weldon Mathis. Although he began a re-election campaign in 1990, a new democratic election process and the rise of a reform movement within the union led him to withdraw and retire at the end of his term. He stepped down as president at the end of 1991 when his term of office ended. McCarthy was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1919. When he was 15, McCarthy stole a car and took Boston police on a high-speed chase. He ditched the car near the offices of Teamsters Local 25 and hid in the cab of a tractor-trailer truck. When the driver returned, McCarthy talked him into taking him to New York City. McCarthy and the driver became friends, and McCarthy learned to drive a big rig. In 1936, McCarthy stole a blank baptismal certificate and faked his birth date so he could qualify for a chauffeur's license. He joined Local 25, and worked for Benjamin Motor Express. McCarthy served in the United States Army during World War II. In 1946,McCarthy was elected president of the 7,000-member local. McCarthy was elected an international vice president of the Teamsters in 1969. He was elected president of Joint Council 10, which oversaw all Teamsters locals in New England, in 1972. McCarthy ran for election for First Vice President, then the union's number-two position, in 1984. He lost. Union President Jackie Presser accused him of seeking the assistance of organized crime in his election bid. McCarthy denied the accusation, and the case was closed after no additional evidence was forthcoming. In June 1988, union president Jackie Presser took a leave of absence due to ill health. Weldon Mathis, then the union's secretary-treasurer, was named his successor. Mathis enforced two union contracts even though the membership had not approved them by a majority vote. When Presser died in June 1988, McCarthy chose to challenge Mathis for the presidency. On July 18, 1988, after a contentious executive board meeting, McCarthy defeated Mathis 9-to-8. In 1989, McCarthy negotiated an agreement which ended a United States Department of Justice lawsuit seeking trusteeship of the Teamsters union. McCarthy agreed to seek democratic internal reforms and purge the union of corruption. In 1990, McCarthy announced he would seek election for a full term as president. Ron Carey, a Teamster leader from New York City, challenged him for the presidency. McCarthy's political position in the union weakened, and he pulled out of the race in favor of R.V. Durham. He twice faced charges that he had improperly awarded a printing contract to a printing house owned by his son-in-law, once in February 1991 and again in June 1991. Each time, the union's executive board agreed to put off a vote, and McCarthy retained his office. McCarthy lost a re-election as president of Local 25 to George W. Cashman in 1991. In 1992, McCarthy retired as president of Joint Council 10, which he had run for 20 years, and retired to his small brick house in Arlington, Massachusetts. McCarthy and his wife Mary (née Joyce) had two daughters and two sons. McCarthy died of complications from heart disease on November 19, 1998, in Arlington.

In 1910, she moved with her family to Portland, Oregon, where she became pregnant at the age of sixteen. She sought an abortion from Dr. George Watts, which convinced her that all women should have the opportunity to receive an abortion if necessary. When she was 23, Barnett decided to become an abortionist, turning to Dr. Alys Bixby Griff for training. Eventually she partnered with Dr. Watts, who taught her how to perform complex procedures and helped her get a medical license as a chiropractor. She was first arrested in 1940 after a complication arose with a client at a clinic in Reno, Nevada. After this incident, Barnett was in prison intermittently, continuing to perform abortions. She performed an estimated 40,000 abortions and claimed no maternal deaths. In 1966, a Portland jury found her guilty of an unrelated manslaughter, while an Oregon City jury found her guilty of abortion in 1967. Her appeal of both verdicts was rejected by the Supreme Court in 1967, and she went to prison in February 1968. After this conviction she decided to retire. Barnett co-authored an autobiography, They Weep on My Doorstep. Early life Ruth Hanna was born in 1895 in Hood River, Oregon. She was the youngest of three children born to Margaret Belle Hanna and James Ellsworth Hanna. In 1910, Barnett moved with her family to Portland, Oregon. There her father became the first grocer in the village, and Ruth got a job as a dental assistant. In 1911, at the age of 16, Ruth became pregnant. Unsure what to do, she was referred to Dr. George Watts by a patient in her dental clinic. Dr. Watts, a respected physician in the area, performed an abortion on Ruth, and the experience profoundly changed her life. Saved from the shame of bearing an illegitimate child, she came out of the operation with a conviction that anyone who needed an abortion ought to be able to receive one. Two years later, Ruth married Henry Cohen at eighteen years old. Their marriage was largely unhappy and lasted only five years, but resulted in the birth of Ruth's daughter, Maggie. Through this marriage, Ruth met and befriended Dr. Alys Bixby Griff. Griff was one of the first female physicians in the Pacific Northwest, and she was beginning to specialize in abortions when she met Ruth. Throughout the course of their friendship, Ruth would visit Griff, listening attentively to the stories she told about her practice. Following Ruth's divorce from Cohen, she decided to pursue a career as an abortionist with the help of Dr. Griff. Early career At the age of 23, Ruth began working for Dr. Griff as an assistant. They worked closely for eleven years, with Griff allowing Ruth to stand in during operations to learn abortion techniques. Eventually Ruth was able to perform the operations herself, concluding that this was her life's work. Ruth parted uneasily with Alys eleven years later, partly due to growing disagreements about Ruth's role in the practice. Hoping to strike out on her own, she opened a small business that ultimately failed. That same year, she began to collaborate with Dr. George Watts, the same physician who gave her an abortion in 1911. Not only did Dr. Watts expand her knowledge of abortion techniques, he also helped her get a license to practice medicine. Ruth enrolled in a two-year chiropractor program, which placed an emphasis on naturopathy. After receiving her certification and apprenticing under Dr. Watts for another five years, Ruth began her independent career by buying the practices of several retiring physicians. Despite the fact that abortions had been illegal in Oregon since 1854, Ruth was able to begin her long career as an abortionist. She opened the Stewart Clinic in Portland, Oregon during the 1930s. The police paid little to no attention to her practice, as anti-abortion laws were rarely enforced at that time unless maternal death occurred. When she opened her practice, America was starting to feel the effects of the Great Depression. Because very few people could afford to have more children to feed, Ruth's business was incredibly sought after. Ruth made about $182,000 per year at this practice, which is the modern equivalent of about $3,250,000 per year. Despite her lack of legal certification, she maintained the highest safety record of practicing abortionists in the area, including licensed practitioners. In fact, the majority of her patients were referred to her by properly licensed practitioners. Later career and trouble with the law Though her clinic remained open, in 1940 Ruth was recruited to help operate a sect of abortion clinics in Reno, Nevada. She was recruited by Reg Rankin, who was trying to legitimize his abortion syndicate after a recent client almost died of an infection. In later years, Ruth would deeply regret the decision to help run the clinic in Reno as one of the worst decisions of her career. Upon arriving, she found that the clinic was not properly set up or supplied, and after performing her first operation there her client developed an infection. This led to her first arrest, which was a huge embarrassment for a woman who prided herself on her safety record and skills as a practitioner. She was eventually released from custody after providing information about the abortion syndicate she was working for, then she fled back to Portland. After the Reno incident, Ruth continued to work at the Stewart Clinic. In the postwar period following World War II, there was an increased crackdown on the enforcement of abortion laws. Additionally, the new mayor of Portland, Dorothy McCullough Lee, had promised to crack down on crime within the city. In 1951, she was arrested for the first time in Portland, Oregon. This began a long relationship with the police. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Ruth was periodically in jail. Despite her regular interactions with law enforcement, Ruth continued to run her clinic. In fact, Stewart Clinic remained open for 33 years. In 1968, when Ruth was 73, the stints in jail and health problems forced Ruth into retirement.

The most basic form of monolithic architecture is a rock-cut building, such as the monolithic churches of Ethiopia built by the Zagwe dynasty, or the Pancha Rathas in India. These are cut out of solid rock, to which they remain attached at the base. In most cases this is evident from the remaining surrounding rock, but sometimes a building is cut from an outcrop, as in the Shore Temple in southern India, and only inspection at close quarters reveals that the building is monolithic. The terms monolith and monolithic column are normally used for objects made from a single large piece of rock which is detached from the ground. They may have been moved a considerable distance, as with several ancient Egyptian obelisks, which have been moved across the world. Buildings with a structural material that is poured into place, most commonly concrete, can also be described as monolithic. Extreme examples are monolithic domes, where the material is sprayed inside of a form to produce the solid structure. An ancient example of a monolithic dome is that of the Mausoleum of Theodoric in Ravenna, Italy, whose roof is made from a single stone.

By 1952, the route had been extended west to Iowa 149 near Martinsburg, absorbing most of Iowa 304, which served Ollie. The section from Iowa 78 to Ollie remained as Iowa 304 until 1980. Before the US 218 / Iowa 27 freeway was built, Iowa 78 overlapped US 218 through Olds. After the expressway opened in 1999, US 218 was placed onto the new road while Iowa 78 stayed on the old two-lane alignment.

Ross was born in Bridgend, Scotland. He emigrated to Australia in 1837, arriving in Sydney on 31 August 1837. He first gained employment as a shepherd for George Macleay and in 1838 he joined Charles Bonney in the first cattle drive from the Goulburn River to Adelaide. In South Australia he successfully managed several large sheep properties and conducted exploration of the area. In 1869 he explored the Stevenson River to Eringa and Mount Humphries; he named the mountains after his children, Sarah, Rebecca, Alexander and John. In 1870 his then employer Thomas Elder recommended Ross' service to Charles Todd, the colony's superintendent of telegraphs and government astronomer. Todd employed Ross to lead exploration of the route for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. Ross' party ventured across the MacDonnell Ranges, the Simpson Desert, the Phillipson and Giles creeks and the Fergusson Ranges;Details of the movements of the exploration party and other observations were recorded by John Ross in a diary kept during the Overland Telegraph Survey Expedition, see State Records of South Australia GRG 154/1 Diary - John Ross, Leader, Overland Telegraph Survey Expedition, transcribed by GRG 154/2 Transcription of diary and miscellaneous papers - John Ross, Leader, Overland Telegraph Survey Expedition they also arrived at the Todd River. In March 1871 he arrived at and gave an English name to Alice Springs, however he found out that the European, W. W. Mills has been there before him. The party eventually made their way to Darwin. Ross was employed by Elder to explore between Peake and Perth. He failed due to lack of fresh water. He went on the manage properties in Victoria and Queensland, later returning to Norwood in South Australia. He died in Adelaide in poverty in 1903. See also *List of explorers References *G. W.

Cytokinesis in green algae occurs via a diverse range of mechanisms, including cleavage furrows in some algae and cell plates in others. Some green algae of the class Charophyceae use phragmoplasts similar to those in embryophytes to organize and guide the growing cell plate. In these algae, the microtubules of the telophase spindle give rise to the phragmoplast and are oriented perpendicular to the plane of cell division and the forming cell plate. The growth of the cell plate eventually disrupts the telophase spindle (see case 4 in picture). In the Chlorophyceae, the most common form of cell division occurs via a phycoplast. In these algae, the spindle collapses and a new system of microtubules forms that is oriented in parallel to the plane of cell division. This phycoplast can be observed in algae undergoing cytokinesis via cleavage furrow (case 1 in picture) as well as algae utilizing a cell plate (case 3 in picture). The phycoplast may play a role in assuring that the plane of cell division will pass between the two daughter nuclei. Typically, these algae undergo \\"closed\\" mitosis where the nuclear envelope persists throughout mitosis.  References  *P.H. Raven, R.F. Evert, S.E.

Technology in science fiction examines the possibilities and implications of new technological concepts. Authors have taken, or created, new innovations and technologies, and elaborated on what they might be and how they might be used. This exchange goes in both directions – sometimes the technology appears first in science fiction, then becomes reality (such as space travel) and other times the real technology comes first, and science fiction authors speculate about how it might be used, and how it might affect the human condition. Likewise, the accuracy of the technology portrayed spans a wide range – sometimes it is existing technology, sometimes it is a physically realistic portrayal of a far-out technology, and sometimes it is simply a plot device that looks scientific, but has no basis in science. Examples drawn from space travel in science fiction include: *Realistic case: Space suits. These are almost always based on existing suits, or near-term extrapolation of their capabilities. *Extrapolation: Travel within the Solar System. As of 2019, humans have only traveled in Earth orbit or from Earth to Moon and back. However, travelling within the Solar System violates no physical principles. *Plot device: faster- than-light drive. It is unsupported by physics as we know it, but needed for galaxy-wide or intergalactic plots with human lifespans.  Fictional technologies that have since been realized  Almost every new technology that becomes practical was previously used in science fiction. The following are a few examples, from a very large set: Transparent Aluminum as featured in the Star Trek universe has since become a reality as Aluminium oxynitride (ALON™), patented in 1985, and as different from metallic aluminum as rust is from iron. Rather than being used as transparent blast shielding as in the fictional Enterprise class starships, this transparent ceramic is used, as the chemically similar (and similarly expensive) corundum (crystalline aluminum oxide) has long been used, in tough windows. Tractor/Repulsor Beams have been realized as Laser-based Optical tweezers,Optical Tweezers an Introduction and more recently as a pair of Bessel beams. These instruments use the radiation from the laser beam to manipulate microscopic particles in what is called an \\"optical trap\\" along the length of the beam as desired. Fictional Tractor beams have been prominently used in the Star Wars universe and in the Star Trek universe. In an early scene of Star Wars: A New Hope a large spaceship uses such a beam to seize a small one, in order to capture the protagonists. Artificial Vision/Prosthetic Eyes Visual prosthesis has been a topic of experiments since the late 20th century. Notable characters using artificial vision include all characters from the Ghost in the Shell series who use prosthetic bodies e.g. Batou's ranger eyes, Saito's left eye, and Motoko Kusanagi's artificial eyes, Geordi La Forge from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series who made use of a VISOR and later; ocular implants, RoboCop from the RoboCop series, Spike Spiegel from the Cowboy Bebop anime series, and the Illusive Man from the Mass Effect series of videogames. Cell Phones the science fiction franchise Star Trek introduced the wireless communication device that has since become the cell phone. The actual idea of small, portable phones goes back decades before this. Science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein in his 1948 book Space Cadet, had a young man named Matt reach into his pouch, pull out his phone and answer it to talk to his father, and a young man answering a phone call on his horse in Heinlein's 1961 book Between Planets.http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=745 (Retrieved September 30, 2020). Tricorder The Lab-On-a-Chip Application Development Portable Test System (LOCAD-PTS) used by astronauts on the International Space Station is designed specifically to biochemical molecules with the purpose of \\"identifying microbes on space station services\\" through use of the Gram Staining Method. Though less advanced than the fictional tricorder of the Star Trek series, the LOCAD-PTS is useful for quickly identifying bacteria and fungi on the International Space Station without having to send samples back to Earth, thus risking contamination or degradation. Fungi have proven to be a hazard if left unchecked on the space station as they managed to decompose some Russian electronics. The Tricorder featured in the Star Trek universe was capable of measuring almost anything, from the chemical composition of explosives, to the life signs of a dying humanoid. The LOCAD-PTS does not differentiate between live and dead test material yet.  Spaceflight  Since the principles of rocketry were worked out in the early 20th century, writers have used straightforward extrapolation to support stories of interplanetary exploration, colonization, conquest and so forth. With new developments in space exploration and technology the idea of space exploration became a reality. Though many writers explored space travel before these events and inventions, the reality of new technologies and the evidence that space exploration was now possible opened new doors to create more fantastical ideas of space travel. Many Science Fiction topics are born from reality, but turn these new technologies to create imagined realities, thus creating Science Fiction in itself. The Saturn V carrying Apollo 11 to the Moon, blasting off on July 16, 1969 1903 – The Wright brothers invented the first motored and manned airplane, launching the age of human flight 1920s – Robert Goddard and Wernher von Braun developed liquid-fueled rockets, later applied as the V2 in war. Fictional spaceships of the 1950s were typically shaped like the V2. Later long range missiles influenced later fiction. The Space Race between the US and Soviet Union inspired more precise depiction of technology already under development. The launch of the first man-made object to orbit Earth; USSR's Sputnik 1 (October 4, 1957) Space stations, first presented in crude form by The Brick Moon, were popularized in the 1960s by books agitating for further development. Those little resembled the Salyut 1 or later actual stations. 2001: A Space Odyssey (film) presented the \\"rotating wheel space station\\" of the 1960s but few others did. The long-running fictional Deep Space Nine (space station) and Babylon 5 (space station) little resembled any of the above. = Faster than light = Galactic-scale stories usually call for interstellar travel in human lifetimes, which is not supported by existing science, so this technology is more speculative. Among the earliest introductions to this concept include E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's element X-powered spaceship in the Skylark and Lensman series (1920s). The so-called X solution unlocked the atomic power of copper, which is then used to power an advanced propulsion system. In these narratives, the ships are \\"inertia-less\\"; this Inertialess drive makes travel effortless at huge multiples of the speed of light up to infinity speed, the stage at which mythological angels appear in electromagnetic reality. The faster-than-light travel was also explained in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series and became a familiar term thereafter particularly since the concept was also used by the Star Wars films as well as other fictional intergalactic narratives. Hyperspace commonly designates one class of technology, where infinite speeds are possible; a ship may jump to hyper space or star drive \\"clutching at the very fabric of time itself\\" thus making travel that would normally take thousands of years possible in no time at all. One example of narrative descriptions for hyperspace was John E. Stith's conceptualization in the novel Redshift Rendezvouz (1990). The author described that a spacecraft operating in a hyperspace moves at exactly 1,024 times the speed of light relative to normal space time, with the speed of light lower than 300,000 kilometers per second.  Mechanical life/Androids/Robots  While now (as of 2017) there are companies that are fully devoted to creating robots and artificial intelligence, these ideas were long present in science fiction before they started to become real technology. Mechanical and artificial characters were derived both from extrapolations of real engineering efforts, and from the whims and imaginations of the authors. This technology has given writers, as well as other forms of art, the inspiration to create non-human characters. = Early fiction about mechanical life = C-3PO of Star Wars * Olimpia – \\"The Sandman\\", a short story by E.

The term is often applied to general-purpose computers and also in the field of scientific investigation into the theory and practical application of AI. A robot is an electro-mechanical or bio-mechanical device or group of devices that can perform autonomous or preprogrammed tasks. An android is a robot made to resemble a human, usually both in appearance and behavior. The word derives from the Greek andr-, \\" meaning \\"man, male\\", and the suffix -eides, used to mean \\"of the species; alike\\" (from eidos \\"species\\"). A cyborg is a cybernetic organism which adds to or enhances its abilities by using technology. A mecha is a large robotic mobile suit, sometimes piloted, sometimes remote-operated, and often used for combat or labor. Mechas usually come equipped with enhanced strength, rocket-propelled flight and an assortment of built-in weapons. =Early timeline of real world technology= *1957: Applied Physics Laboratory AIS begins with focus on learning machines and self-organizing systems. *1961: MINOS 1 First perceptron machine, responds to a pattern of binary inputs using weights. *1966: Artificial Intelligence Center is formed *1966-1972: Shakey the Robot First autonomous mobile robots, controlled from radio and TV links. *1968: A* Algorithm Graph-searching algorithm used to route planning solver for navigation. *1969: STRIPS Planning engine for Shakey. *1969: QA3 and QA4 Automated problem solving.  ESP/Psychic powers/Psi phenomena  With new developments in science and technology helping to study and promote parapsychology or Psi Phenomena, many SF writers felt the need to incorporate and elaborate on these subjects in their stories. While technology helped the investigation into Psi Phenomena it also created questions that many SF writers chose to answer, through their stories, in their own unique way. If we look at some of the examples of Psi Phenomena prominent in stories, they may have stemmed from how science would take this experimentation with Psi Phenomena and use it. In Stephen King's \\"The Dead Zone\\", we see how precognition was used to affect political candidates. The idea that someone could harness this power and use it for good or evil was one that many SF writer's elaborated on. In \\"The Foreign Hand Tie\\" by Randall Garret espionage takes on a new form via telepathy through twins. When science and technology can be used to anchor something in reality, via experimentation or exploration, and yield results, it creates controversy that society may fear or even fantasize about. Throughout SF history, Psi Phenomena can be seen to be used for good and evil, and through new science and technological discoveries, this genre then becomes more real and more elaborate. = Terms commonly used = *Telepathy: the ability to read minds *Precognition: the ability to see the future *Telekinesis: the ability to move objects with mental force (Psychokinesis (PK for short) or \\"mind over matter\\") *Teleportation: the ability to move oneself from one place to the other, or back and forward in time *Telempathy: Emotion-reading *Remote viewing/Clairvoyance/Scrying: the ability for seeing things not actually before your eyes *Psychometry: the ability to sense what has touched a certain physical object or the imprint it has left behind *Bilocation: the ability to be in two places at the same time. *Pyrokinesis: the capability to start fires by mental action alone =Writers to mention these topics= * G. H. Ryan: \\"Fifteen Months in the Moon\\" (1880) * Fitz James O’Brien: \\"The Bohemian\\" (1885) * Arthur C.

The Scientific Revolution featured ideas that life should be \\"led by reason\\" and that, \\"the universe as a mechanistic, deterministic system could eventually be known accurately and fully through observation and reason\\". While new science and technology gave rise to skepticism towards the existence of psi phenomena, it also gave way for new technologies to be applied in either proving or disproving such phenomena. One of the first experimental approaches to Psi Phenomena started in the 1930s and was conducted under the direction of J.B. Rhine (1895–1980). Rhine popularized the now famous methodology of card guessing and dice rolling experiments in a laboratory in attempt to find statistical validation for ESP. In 1957 the Parapsychological Association was formed at the preeminent society for parapsychology. Openness to new parapsychology studies and occult phenomena continued to rise in the 1970s. =Technological developments= *Ganzfeld Experiment: homogenous, unpatterned, sensory stimulation to produce an effect similar to sensory deprivation *Development of statistical tools by R. A. Fisher in the 1920s =Timeline of probable influences= E. Dawson Rogers hopes to gain new respectability for spiritualism and founds Society for Psychical Research in 1882 Government investigations into parapsychology: Project Star Gate, formed in 1970 with cooperation from the Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, investigates remote viewing, sees nothing useful Visitors from other planets Extraterrestrial life is a familiar topic in fiction. In the centuries since astronomers discovered that planets are worlds, people have speculated on the possibility of life existing there, though xenobiology has remained a science without a subject. However, people from afar, or alien creatures with various powers and purposes, provided fresh new material for fiction. Some stories were about friendly visitors who got along with humans, such as the aliens in the Keroro Gunsou series, when they give up on attempting to take over planet Earth. Others made alien invasion their theme, as in the 1898 novel, War of the Worlds. Meteorites have long shown that foreign bodies sometimes enter Earth's atmosphere, and the term \\"flying saucer\\" was coined in 1947. Several science fiction novels used them. =Early writers= *The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells, first serialised in 1897 *Martians, Go Home by Fredric Brown, 1956 *The Moon that Vanished by Leigh Brackett, 1950 *3 From Out There by Leo Margulies, 1959 *To Outrun Doomsday by Kenneth Bulmer, 1957 *Venus Stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs, 1955 =Other terms= * NTI: Non-Terrestrial Intelligence (A term for alien life that dwells in the oceans or otherwise not on land) *UFO: Unidentified Flying Object *Flying Saucer: A certain kind of space ship =Timeline of non science fiction influences= *Antiquity onward: Philosophers have debated the existence of extraterrestrial life. *1609: Galileo, using a telescope to observe the heavens, discovers that planets are other worlds. *1877: Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli reported the appearance of certain long, thin lines he called canali, meaning channels in Italian. *early 1900s: Astronomer Percival Lowell, a science popularizer, wrote the books \\"Mars\\" (1895), \\"Mars and Its Canals\\" (1906), and \\"Mars As the Abode of Life\\" (1908). This was considered science at the time, not fiction, but has been shown to be incorrect by modern missions to Mars. *2009: NASA's Kepler mission shows that an assumption of science fiction, that planets are common throughout the galaxy, is in fact true.  Parallel worlds  The notion of parallel worlds have always intrigued different types of genres, especially the science fiction aspect. Many authors have used the idea of travelling back into prehistoric times or traveling forwards to an unknown universe. The idea of entering a world that has not been touched or that has evolved into a new incomprehensible parallel, makes people ponder about what it could looks like or what it could be. Authors have used this notion of an alternate reality and have created their own worlds that have given readers a different view of alternate worlds. = Early writers = *Sideways in Time by Murray Leinster Novel (1934) *Lest Darkness Fall By L. Sprague De Camp Novel (1939) *Horsesense Hank in the Parallel Worlds by Nelson S. Bond Magazine (1942) *The Alteration by Kingsley Amis Novel (1976) *The Anubis Gates By Tim Powers Novel (1983) = Definition = Parallel Universe Parallel universe or alternate reality in science fiction and fantasy is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own =Other terms= Multiverse Set of many universes. There are many specific uses of the concept, as well as systems in which a multiverse is proposed to exist in. Parallel universe alternate universes, worlds, realities and dimensions in fiction. Alternate reality alternate universes, worlds, realities and dimensions in fiction. Alternate future is a possible future which never comes to pass, typically because someone travels back into the past and alters it so that the events of the alternate future cannot occur. =Early timeline= Gravitational distortions caused by a black hole in front of the Large Magellanic Cloud (artistic interpretation Provided by: Black hole ) *1905: Albert Einstein Proposes Special theory of Relativity *1905: Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity shows that space and time are relative, not absolute, and that time is actually a fourth dimension within what he calls \\"space-time.\\" *1916: Einstein discovers that space-time is curved. *1920s: Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Dirac reformulate mechanics into Quantum Mechanics, based on the Uncertainty Principle. *1922: Kaluza–Klein theory combined Einstein's General Relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory in 5 dimensions. *1937: Mathematician Kurt Gödel proposes that the universe itself may be a time machine. *1949: Gödel demonstrates mathematically that pathways through time are consistent with general relativity (see Gödel metric). *1967: U.S. physicist John Wheeler invents the name \\"black hole\\" to describe singularities in space and time.  Invisibility  The idea of being unseen and hence undetectable has fascinated mankind for generations. This concept has generated scientific pursuit towards defying our physical parameters. Many authors have toyed with the idea of gaining invisibility via both science-based and fictional means. Invisibility in the actual scientific world will be a very difficult achievement, one that will involve much more complication than we have begun to delve into. Further technological developments bring us closer to our goal, while also broadening the horizon for science fiction authors performing thought experiments on the topic of invisibility. = Mythology and folklore precursors = Many myths and legends include gods, spirits, angels, and demons that are often invisible or can choose to become invisible at will. *One of the first stories to explore the idea of invisibility was in Plato's The Republic. A peasant finds a ring in the tomb of a dead king that allows him to become invisible. He enters the palace, seduces the queen, and plots to kill the present king, showing that power such as invisibility corrupts. *Perseus, the Greek mythic hero who helped establish the Twelve Olympians, was equipped with a cap of invisibility to kill Medusa. =Early writers= *H. G. Wells wrote The Invisible Man (1897) which was the first science fiction novel to explore the idea of invisibility. The invisible man is a scientist named Griffin who theorizes that if a person's refractive index is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will not be visible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but cannot become visible again, leading to mental instability. *J. R. R. Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings series which revolves around the function of a ring that renders the user invisible. Unfortunately, it had an evil influence with negative effects on the wearer's actions. *Douglas Adams wrote The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1978) novels which encompass a humorous concept of a field which makes people believe the object in question is \\"somebody else's problem\\" and therefore do not see it. This concept as explained in the book, bases off of a statement to the effect that actual invisibility is impossible and that the field is merely a way to make something close to being invisible by actually making it hard to notice deliberately. *Philip K. Dick wrote in his 1974 novel A Scanner Darkly of a \\"scramble suit.\\" This is a flexible sheath covering the body of the wearer with a reflective/refractive coating on the inside surface that transfers the camouflaging pattern- projected by a holographic lens mounted on the wearer's head- onto the outside surface of the sheath causing a camouflage-like invisibility. =Definition= Invisibility is a term that is usually used as a fantasy or science fiction term where objects are literally made unseeable by magical or technological means. =Invisibility in science fiction= There is an undeniable link between science fact and the ideas that emerge in science fiction. Science fiction authors are inspired by actual scientific and technological discoveries, but allow themselves the freedom to project the possible future course of these discoveries and their potential impact on society, perhaps only weakly bound to the facts. =Invisibility in fiction= Authors are faced with obstacles presented by the realities of actual technology, however fiction allows a window for the opportunity of inventing completely imaginary technologies to move their storyline forward and maybe even still explore the outcomes of such power. *Magic objects such as rings and cloaks can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility. *Spells and potions can be used or cast upon people or objects granting temporary invisibility. = Timeline of possible influences = * 17th century the refractive index was developed. Major advances near the end of the 19th century raised author's awareness. * 1670s Emitting or reflecting light outside the wavelength range of visible light would result in a human-shaped black hole which would be completely opaque. * 1930s Chroma key began to develop which is the removal of color from one image to reveal another image \\"behind it.\\" The removed color becomes transparent, which is also called \\"color keying.\\" * 1938 Stealth technology began to develop. It is used with aircraft, ships, and missiles, in order to make them less visible to certain detection methods. * 1966 An enemy in a Star Trek episode uses a Cloaking device. Other fiction has used a cloak of invisibility.

It begins in McGregor at an intersection with U.S. Highway 18; the first of the route are signed as U.S. Highway 18 Business (US 18 Bus.). It crosses into Minnesota near Eitzen and continues as Trunk Highway 76. Route description Iowa Highway 76 begins as U.S. Highway 18 Business at U.S. Highway 18 west of McGregor. The route descends into the Mississippi River valley along the northern border of Pikes Peak State Park and then turns into McGregor. Through McGregor, US 18 Bus. heads to the northeast towards the Mississippi River. Along the river, the highway is parallel to the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad (DM&E; Railroad). For one mile (1.6 km), US 18 Bus. travels a narrow strip of land between the river and the bluffs where it passes the Isle of Capri casino. Iowa 76, as U.S. Highway 18 Business, through McGregor At Marquette, US 18 Bus. ends at the foot of the Marquette–Joliet Bridge, which carries US 18 to Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. At US 18, Iowa 76 appears for the first time and continues to the north. Between Marquette and the mouth of the Yellow River, Iowa 76 runs parallel to the DM&E; Railroad along the western bank of the Mississippi River. It turns inland near Effigy Mounds National Monument, turning to the northwest towards Waukon. It passes near the Yellow River State Forest and through the unincorporated community of Rossville. South of Waukon, Iowa 76 intersects Iowa 9\\\\. Eastbound Iowa 9 and northbound Iowa 76 head north together for two miles (3.2 km). At Main Street, the two highways split; Iowa 9 continues north while Iowa 76 heads west for a few blocks before turning north itself. From the western edge of Waukon, it travels north into the rolling hills of the Driftless Area, an area of the Midwestern United States which was untouched by glaciation in the last Ice Age. The highway descends into the Upper Iowa River valley where it crosses the Upper Iowa and its tributaries, Bear Creek and Waterloo Creek. Iowa 76 follows Waterloo Creek for until they near the unincorporated community of Dorchester. From Dorchester, the highway curves to the east and north, traveling to the Minnesota state line south of Eitzen. History Iowa Highway 76 was created in 1969 from a segment of Iowa Highway 13 from Marquette to Minnesota. Iowa 13's northernmost were truncated at a point west of McGregor at its intersection with U.S. Highway 52. Iowa 13 overlapped US 52 and US 18 for ; the remaining became Iowa 76. In 1989, Iowa 76 was extended to the south when a new bypass around McGregor was opened. US 18 was moved onto the bypass and the old road became Iowa 76, but was marked as U.S. Highway 18 Business. The only proof of Iowa 76 along US 18 Bus. are small Iowa 76 route markers above the mile markers.

ZNT8 is a zinc transporter related to insulin secretion in humans. Certain alleles of the SLC30A8 gene may increase the risk for developing type 2 diabetes, but a loss-of-function mutation appears to greatly reduce the risk of diabetes.  Clinical significance  = Association with type 2 diabetes (T2D)= Twelve rare variants in SLC30A8 have been identified through the sequencing or genotyping of approximately 150,000 individuals from 5 different ancestry groups. SLC30A8 contains a common variant (p.Trp325Arg), which is associated with T2D risk and levels of glucose and proinsulin. Individuals carrying protein-truncating variants collectively had 65% reduced risk of T2D. Additionally, non-diabetic individuals from Iceland harboring a frameshift variant p. Lys34Serfs*50 demonstrated reduced glucose levels. Earlier functional studies of SLC30A8 suggested that reduced zinc transport increased T2D risk. Conversely, loss-of-function mutations in humans indicate that SLC30A8 haploinsufficiency protects against T2D. Therefore, ZnT8 inhibition can serve as a therapeutic strategy in preventing T2D.

It was named for Dr. William Pitcairn, Scottish physician and gardener (1711–1791). The genus Pitcairnia ranks as the second most prolific of the bromeliad family (after Tillandsia). They are most abundant in Colombia, Peru and Brazil, but can also be found in areas from Cuba and Mexico south to Argentina. One species, Pitcairnia feliciana is found in tropical West Africa and is the only member of the family Bromeliaceae not native to the Americas.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Almost all Pitcairnias are terrestrial or saxicolous, and prefer moist areas. However, many are found growing epiphytically in trees. 44 Pitcairnia species had been classified in the genus Pepinia. Pepinia was first established as a subgenus by Lyman Smith and then elevated to a genus by Varadarajan and Gilmatin based on the absence of seed appendages. A molecular study supports the view that the plants are best classified within Pitcairnia. Species * Pitcairnia abundans L.B.

It holds the distinction of being the first British-designed aircraft to be furnished with a delta wing. Initially referred to as the Type R, work on the aircraft had begun with the intention of developing a ramp-launched vertical takeoff (VTO) fighter. As its design was refined, the VTO features were discarded, instead exploring other concepts in line with Air Ministry Specification E.10/47. Accordingly, the aircraft was developed to investigate the then-unfamiliar qualities of the delta wing, particularly its flight characteristics when flown at transonic speeds. A total of three aircraft were ordered by the Ministry of Supply (MoS). The type received the name \\"Fairey Delta\\" shortly thereafter. The first aircraft was produced at Fairey's facility in Heaton Chapel, Stockport. Ground testing commenced during mid-1950. On 12 March 1951, the FD1 performed its maiden flight, being flown by Fairey test pilot Group Captain R. Gordon. The aircraft received several modifications as a consequence of a landing accident in September 1951. Further flight testing determined that the FD1 exhibited numerous unfavourable qualities in terms of handling and stability, which contributed to the cancellation of the two further airframes. Following the end of government interest, Fairey continued to operate the sole completed FD1 to support their own research purposes up until the aircraft sustained substantial damage in a landing accident on 6 February 1956, after which it was deemed uneconomic to repair. Design and development What would become the Fairey Delta 1 (FD1) had been originally conceived internally by Fairey as a vertical takeoff (VTO) fighter. In concept, the company hoped that it would be a capable interceptor aircraft that could be launched from smaller ships as well as aircraft carriers. The specific VTO method intended to be used would have involved a steeply inclined ramp, which was supposed to be mobile. Unlike its launch system, the aircraft would have landed conventionally, being envisaged as being compatible with the existing arresting gear of Royal Navy aircraft carriers. While the Second World War was still being fought when Fairey had begun work on the concept, the conflict's end meant that the urgency of its development was quickly curtailed as well.Hobbs 2014, p. 309. During July 1946, Fairey was issued with a contract to further develop their VTO concept aircraft.van Pelt 2012, p. 149. Prior to the development of full- scale aircraft, a number of pilotless radio-controlled scale models were produced and flown, which supplied Fairey's design team with real world data to support further work. These rocket-powered models explored several diverse forms of swept wings, including forward-swept and compound wing designs. The first model was launched during 1949 from a ship out at sea in Cardigan Bay, Wales. Several later tests of the models was conducted at the RAAF Woomera Range Complex in Australia; a total of 40 models were completed and launched, the last of which during 1953.Jackson 2007, p. 171.van Pelt 2012, pp. 149-150. While the project was at an early stage, Fairey was actively advocating the value of their research programme to various British official; these efforts attracted the attention of the Ministry of Supply (MoS), as well as some interest from both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. After evaluating the concept, the MoS decided that it would want the aircraft produced as a more conventional jet-powered research vehicle to fulfil the requirements of Specification E.10/47. Three aircraft were ordered with the name \\"Fairey Delta\\" applied to the project; subsequently, the name was changed to Fairey Delta 1.Winchester 2005, p. 254. The Fairey Type R design was a compact mid- wing tailless delta monoplane; aviation periodical Flight observed the aircraft to be \\"of exceptionally small dimensions\\". It had a circular cross- section fuselage and a single engine air inlet located at the extreme front. The powerplant adopted for the aircraft was a single Rolls-Royce Derwent 8 centrifugal turbojet engine. According to aviation author Robert Jackson, the FD1 was intended to be outfitted with larger booster rockets to facilitate ramp take-offs, during which control would have been maintained via four swivelling jet nozzles on the rear fuselage. Although designed as a transonic aircraft, the FD1 had a short-coupled, \\"portly\\" appearance, completely at odds with Fairey's next design, the sleek and elegant Delta 2.Flanagan 2017, p. 95. Fairey stated that the aircraft's delta wing possessed several attributes that were favourable for high speed flight, including relatively low drag characteristics and a comparatively stiff structure, along with stowage space for both fuel and armaments.Flight 1951, pp. 348-349. Although originally envisaged for ramp launching, the FD1 was fitted with a tricycle undercarriage. The FD1 was fitted with a small horizontal delta-shaped control surface on the top of the tailfin; this surface was intended to eliminate adverse instances of \\"serious pitching as it gathered speed.\\" During early development, a maximum speed of 587 mph as well as the ability to attain an altitude of 30,000 feet within four and a half minutes were envisioned; however, the addition of the new tail surface had the consequence of severely limiting the aircraft's top speed to a relatively pedestrian 345 mph (555 km/h). Operational history Manchester (Ringway) Airport in May 1950 assembled for ground taxiing trials. Note it is already fitted with the additional delta-shaped control surface at the tip of its tail fin. The only FD1 to be completed was built at Fairey's Heaton Chapel Stockport factory and taken by road to their test facility at Manchester's Ringway Airport for final assembly. Starting on 12 May 1950 it made several high-speed taxi runs down the 4,200-foot main runway there before being partially dismantled and transported by road to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (AAEE) at RAF Boscombe Down. After further taxi tests, the aircraft (serial number VX350) made its maiden flight on 12 March 1951; flown by Fairey test pilot Group Captain R. Gordon Slade, this flight lasted for 17 minutes.Flight 1951, p. 348. The FD1 underwent extensive flight testing, which largely focused on exploring its lateral and longitudinal stability, as well as its overall flying characteristics.Jackson 2007, pp. 171-172. These flights helped determine that the aircraft possessed serious stability problems; its lack of stability led to the aircraft being often characterized as being \\"dangerous.\\" Following a landing accident that occurred in September 1951, the FD1 was grounded for two years. During this time, it received several modifications; changes included the removal of the temporary slots, as well as the deletion of the streamlined housings for the anti-spin parachutes that were mounted at the wingtips. The large control surfaces have been attributed with causing difficulty in controlling the FD1, making it hard to fly with precision, although it could achieve a rapid roll rate. During 1953, the flight test programme was terminated by the Air Ministry, resulting in the withdrawal of state support for the FD1.Jackson 2007, p. 172. Only a single FD1 was built; the second (VX357) and third (VX364) airframes were cancelled prior to production commencing. This decision was not regarded as being a particularly heavy blow to Fairey, even in terms of the firm's ambitions to explore high speed delta wing aircraft, as detailed design work had already commenced on the more capable and sleeker-looking Fairey Delta 2 during the previous year. Following the programme's cancellation, the sole aircraft continued to be flown for a time by Fairey to perform trials work.Chorlton 2012, p. 104. On 6 February 1956, the FD1 was damaged beyond repair in a landing accident at Boscombe Down. In October 1956, the aircraft was transported by road for use as a static target on the Shoeburyness weapons range, after which it was later scrapped. Fairey had spent £382,000 of their own money on the FD1. Specifications (Fairey Delta 1) See also References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Chorlton, Martyn (ed). Fairey - Company Profile 1915-1960.

It is described as the individualist preference for equality and its pleasures, requiring the state - as a tyrant majority or a benevolent authority - to step in and adjudicate. In this regime, political leaders operate under a blanket of restrictions and, while it retains the practical virtues of democracy, citizens influence policymaking through bureaucrats and non-governmental organizations. This is distinguished from despotism or tyranny (hard tyranny) in the sense that state of government in such democratic society is composed of guardians who hold immense and tutelary (protective) power.  Overview  The soft tyranny that Tocqueville envisioned is described as \\"absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild.\\" Here, the state is analogous to a parent and is run by \\"benevolent schoolmasters\\" who secure the needs of the people and watches over their fate, creating an \\"orderly, gentle, peaceful slavery\\" under an administrative despotism. As the objective and the authority of the state provide for people's gratifications, the exercise of the free agency of man is no longer useful or used less frequently, with his will circumscribed within a narrower range, finally reducing him to a perpetual childhood. According to Tocqueville, the danger of this form of government comes amid the satisfaction of material well-being because it puts the individuals' critical faculties to sleep. In this condition, people who are used to a culture of gain, comfort, career, and wealth shudder at the thought of revolution and the emergent consumerism drives the society's cultural decline. Tocqueville explained that the principle of equality is partly responsible for this phenomenon because it has disposed men to endure such kind of tyranny and made them look on it and its features as benefits. Some consider soft tyranny a phenomenon of modern societies (or of the future) because these are considered infertile grounds for hard tyranny. The thinker cited that there are those such as the Americans who overcome the danger soft tyranny by ascribing to the ideal of liberty, one that is understood as taking responsibility for one's self-governance and this tradition, for Tocqueville, allows America to avoid soft despotism. Inciting rebellions Soft tyranny is often cited by historians as being the driving force behind many insurrections. The most obvious area in which soft tyranny affects people occurs with their fiscal situations. Price control is typically considered to be a common feature associated with communist societies; however, it relates directly to not only rebellion, but also soft tyranny. For example, when seigneurial rights, such as land taxes and byway tolls, began to seriously irritate the French peasantry in the mid-eighteenth century, violence in the form of rioting emerged as a consequence.John Markoff, \\"Peasants and their Grievances,\\" The Origins of the French Revolution, ed. Peter Campbell (New York: Palgrave-MacMillan, 2006). In effect, the price of bread, which was a staple in the peasant diet, increased to the point where common peasants could not afford to purchase it on a daily basis. These conditions, which can lead to civil unrest, exemplifies a form of soft tyranny which can quietly disrupt and eventually unravel an entire socio-economic order.

The Davidian Revolution is a name given by many scholars to the changes which took place in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of David I (1124-1153). These included his foundation of burghs, implementation of the ideals of Gregorian Reform, foundation of monasteries, Normanization of the Scottish government, and the introduction of feudalism through immigrant Norman and Anglo-Norman knights. Overview King David I is still widely regarded as one of the most significant rulers in Scotland's history. The reason is what Barrow and Lynch both call the \\"Davidian Revolution\\".Barrow, \\"The Balance of New and Old\\", pp. 9-11; Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 80. David's \\"revolution\\" is held to underpin the development of later medieval Scotland, whereby the changes that he inaugurated grew into most of the central non-native institutions of the later medieval kingdom. Barrow summarizes the many and varied goals of David I, all of which began and ended with his determination \\"to surround his fortified royal residence and its mercantile and ecclesiastical satellites with a ring of close friends and supporters, bound to him and his heirs by feudal obligation and capable of rendering him military service of the most up-to- date kind and filling administrative offices at the highest level\\".Barrow, \\"The Balance of New and Old\\", p. 13. =European Revolution: the wider context= Since Robert Bartlett's The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change, 950-1350 (1993), reinforced by Moore's The First European Revolution, c.970–1215 (2000), it has become increasingly apparent that better understanding of David's \\"revolution\\" can be achieved by placing it in the context of a wider European \\"revolution\\". The central idea is that from the late 10th century onwards the culture and institutions of the old Carolingian heartlands in northern France and western Germany spread to outlying areas, creating a more recognizable \\"Europe\\". In this model, the old Carolingian Empire formed a \\"core\\" and the outlying areas a \\"periphery\\". The Norman conquest of England in the years after 1066 is considered to have made England more like if not part of this \\"core\\". In applying this model to Scotland, it would be considered that, as recently as the reign of David's father Máel Coluim III, \\"peripheral\\" Scotland had lacked – in relation to the \\"core\\" cultural regions of northern France, western Germany and England – respectable Catholic religion, a truly centralized royal government, conventional written documents of any sort, native coins, a single merchant town, as well as the essential castle-building cavalry elite. After David's reign, it had gained all of these.Bartlett, The Making of Europe, pp. 24-59; Moore, The First European Revolution, c.970–1215, p. 30ff; see also Barrow, \\"The Balance of New and Old\\", passim, esp. 9; this idea of \\"Europe\\" seems in practice to mean \\"Western Europe\\". During the reign of king David I, then, comparatively straightforward evidence of \\"Europeanization\\" was produced in Scotland – that adoption of the homogenized political, economic, social and cultural modes of medieval civilization, suitably modified for the distinctive Scottish milieu, which in tandem with similar adoptions elsewhere led to the creation of \\"Europe\\" as an identifiable entity for the first time.Moore, The First European Revolution, c.970–1215, p. 30 ff; Haidu, The Subject Medieval/Modern, p. 156ff.; Bartlett, The Making of Europe, pp. 24-59, esp. 51-59\\\\. The idea of \\"Europe\\" would have been available to contemporaries of David, though the concept of \\"Christendom\\" would have been more familiar. This usage of \\"Europe\\" in the sense of a unified cultural entity is identified only by modern historians. This is not to say that the Gaelic matrix into which these additions were disseminated was somehow destroyed or swept away; that was not the way in which the paradigm or \\"blueprint\\" of medieval Europe functioned – it was only a guide, one that specialized in amelioration, and not (usually) demolition.Moore, The First European Revolution, c.970–1215, pp. 38-45; Bartlett, The Making of Europe, p. 104. =European revolution: the Gaelic context= Yet, David's life as a \\"reformer\\" also has a context in the Gaelic-speaking world. This is particularly true in understanding David's enthusiasm for the Gregorian Reform. The latter was a revolutionary movement within the western church partly pioneered in the papacy of Pope Gregory VII which sought renewed spiritual rigour, ecclesiastical discipline and doctrinal obedience to the papacy and its sponsored theologians.G. Ladner, \\"Terms and ideas of renewal\\", pp. 1-33; C. H. Lawrence, Medieval Monasticism, pp. 86, 92, 94-5, 149-50, 163-4; Bartlett, Making of Europe, pp. 243-68; Malcolm Barber, Two Cities, pp. 85-99 The Normans who came to England adopted this ideology, and soon began attacking the Scottish and Irish Gaelic world as spiritually backward - a mindset which even underlay the hagiography of David's mother Margaret, written by her confessor Thurgot at the instigation of the English royal court.Robert Bartlett, \\"Turgot (c.1050–1115)\\", in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 , accessed 11 February 2007; William Forbes-Leith, Turgot, Life of St Margaret, Queen of Scotland, passim; Baker, \\"'A Nursery of Saints\\", pp. 129-132. Yet up until this period, Gaelic monks (often called Céli Dé) from Ireland and Scotland had been pioneering their own kind of ascetic reform both in Great Britain and in continental Europe, where they founded many of their own monastic houses.See, for instance, Dumville, \\"St Cathróe of Metz\\", pp. 172–188; Follett, Céli Dé in Ireland, pp. 1-8, 89-99. Since the end of the 11th century various Gaelic princes had themselves been attempting to accommodate Gregorian reform, examples being Muirchertach Ua Briain, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, and Edgar and Alexander I of Scotland.John Watt, Church in Medieval Ireland, pp. 1-27; Veitch, \\"Replanting Paradise\\", pp. 136-66 Benjamin Hudson stresses the cultural unity of Scotland and Ireland in this period, and uses the example of cooperation between David I, the Scottish reformer, and his Irish counterpart St Malachy, to show at least partly that David's actions can be understood in the Gaelic context as much as the Anglo-Norman one.Hudson, \\"Gaelic Princes and Gregorian Reform\\", pp. 61-82. Indeed, the Gaelic world had never been closed off from its neighbours in England or continental Europe. Gaelic warriors and holymen had been travelling regularly through England and the continent for centuries. David's predecessor Mac Bethad mac Findlaích (King, 1040-57) had employed Norman mercenaries even before the conquest of England,Barrow, \\"Beginnings of Military Feudalism\\", p. 250. and English exiles after the conquest fled to the courts of both Máel Coluim III, King of Scotland, and Toirdelbach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland.Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland, p. 277. Government and feudalism A detail from the Bayeux Tapestry illustrating Norman knights in combat half a century before David's reign. The widespread infeftment of foreign knights and the processes by which land ownership was converted from a matter of customary tenure into a matter of feudal or otherwise legally-defined relationships revolutionized the way the Kingdom of Scotland was governed, as did the dispersal and installation of royal agents in the new mottes that were proliferating throughout the realm to staff newly created sheriffdoms and judiciaries for the twin purposes of law- enforcement and taxation, bringing Scotland further into the \\"European\\" model.Haidu, The Subject Medieval/Modern, p. 181; Moore, The First European Revolution, p. 57: \\"The requirement of tithe...defined the community dependent on each church, and endowed it with clear, universally known borders\\". =Military feudalism= During this period, Scotland experienced innovations in governmental practices and the importation of foreign, generally French, knights. It is to David's reign that the beginnings of feudalism are generally assigned. Geoffrey Barrow wrote that David's reign witnessed \\"a revolution in Scots dynastic law\\" as well as \\"fundamental innovations in military organization\\" and \\"in the composition and dominant characteristics of its ruling class\\".Barrow, ‘Balance’, 9-11. This is defined as \\"castle-building, the regular use of professional cavalry, the knight's fee\\" as well as \\"homage and fealty\\". David established large scale feudal lordships in the west of his Cumbrian principality for the leading members of the French military entourage who kept him in power. Additionally, many smaller scale feudal lordships were created. One example would be Freskin. The latter's name occurs in a charter by David's grandson King William to Freskin's son, William, granting Strathbrock in West Lothian and Duffus, Kintrae, and other lands in Moray, \\"which his father held in the time of King David\\".G.W.S. Barrow, The Acts of William I King of Scots 1165-1214 in Regesta Regum Scottorum, Volume II, (Edinburgh, 1971), no. 116, pp. 198-9; trs. of quote, \\"The Beginnings of Military Feudalism\\" in Barrow (ed.) The Kingdom of the Scots, 2nd Ed. (2003), p. 252. The name Freskin is Flemish,See Barrow, \\"The Beginnings of Military Feudalism\\", p. 252, n. 16, citing T. Forssner, Continental Germanic Personal Names in England, (Uppsala, 1916), p. 95; J. Mansion, Oud-Gentsche Naamkunde, (1924), p. 217; and G. White (ed.), Complete Peerage, vol. xii, pt. I, p. 537, n. d. and in the words of Geoffrey Barrow \\"it is virtually certain that Freskin belonged to a large group of Flemish settlers who came to Scotland in the middle decades of the 12th century and were chiefly to be found in West Lothian and the valley of the Clyde\\".G.W.S. Barrow, \\"Badenoch and Strathspey, 1130-1312: 1. Secular and Political\\" in Northern Scotland, 8 (1988), p. 3. Freskin was responsible for building a castle in the distant territory of Moray, and because Freskin had no kinship ties to the locality, his position was dependent entirely on the king, thus bringing the territory more firmly under royal control. Freskin's land acquisition does not appear to be unique, and may have been part of a royal policy in the aftermath of the defeat of king Óengus of Moray.See Richard Oram, \\"David I and the Conquest of Moray\\", p. & n. 43; see also, L. Toorians, \\"Twelfth-century Flemish Settlement in Scotland\\", pp. 1-14. Duffus Castle, possibly begun by Freskin, one of David's most successful small scale military immigrants. =Anglo-Normanizing government= Steps were taken during David's reigns to make the government of Scotland, or that part of Scotland that he administered, more like the government of Anglo-Norman England. New sheriffdoms enabled the King to effectively administer royal demesne land. During David I's reign, royal sheriffs had been established in the king's core personal territories; namely, in rough chronological order, at Roxburgh, Scone, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Stirling and Perth.McNeill & MacQueen, Atlas of Scottish History p. 193 The Justiciarship too was created in David's reign. Two Justiciarships were created, one for Scotland-proper and one for Lothian, i.e. for Scotland north of the river Forth and Scotland south of the Forth and east of Galloway. Although this institution had Anglo-Norman origins, in Scotland north of the Forth at least it represented some form of continuity with an older office. For instance, Mormaer Causantín of Fife is styled judex magnus (i.e. great Brehon); the Justiciarship of Scotia hence was just as much a Gaelic office modified by Normanisation as it was an import, illustrating Barrow's \\"balance of New and Old\\" argument.See Barrow, G.W.S., \\"The Judex\\", in Barrow (ed.) The Kingdom of the Scots, (Edinburgh, 2003), pp. 57-67 and \\"The Justiciar\\", also in Barrow (ed.) The Kingdom of the Scots, pp. 68–111. David I and the economy Silver penny of David I. =Alston mines= An important source of David's wealth during his career came from the revenue of his English earldom and the proceeds of the silver mines at Alston. Alston silver allowed David to indulge in the \\"regalian gratification\\" of his own coinage, and to continue his project of attempting to link royal power and economic expansion.Norman Davies, The Isles: A History, Sec. 4, p. 85 [photo]; Oram, David I: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 193ff; Bartlett, The Making of Europe, p. 287. To put the true importance of David’s silver in perspective, consider this comment of Ian Blanchard, \\"Lothian and Beyond: The Economy of the ‘English Empire’ of David I\\", p.29: \\"The discovery of [silver at Alston in] 1133 marked the beginnings of the first great regional mining boom which was at its height in c. 1136-8 yielded an output of some three or four tonnes of silver a year, or some ten times more than had been produced in the whole of Europe during any year of the past three-quarters of a millennium\\". Gold was essentially reserved for religion. Building programmes depended to a large degree on disposable income; consumption of foreign and exotic commodities broadened; men of ability and ambition found their way to court and entered the service of the king. What is more, no less than the written word, the coin acted upon the culture and mental categories of people who made use of it. Like a seal displaying the king in majesty, the coin broadcast the image of the ruler to his people and, more fundamentally, altered the simple nature of trade.Oram, David I: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 193, 195; Bartlett, The Making of Europe, p. 287: \\"The minting of coins and the issue of written dispositions changed the political culture of the societies in which the new practices appeared\\". Though coins were not absent from Scotland before David, these were by definition foreign objects, unseen and unused by most of the population. The arrival of a native coinage – no less than the arrival of towns, laws and charters – marked the penetration of the \\"Europeanizing\\" concepts of European culture into ever less \\"non-European\\" Scotland. =Creation of burghs= Máel Coluim IV; these were essentially Scotland-proper's first towns. David was also a great town builder. In part, David made use of the \\"English\\" income secured for him by his marriage to Matilda de Senlis in order to finance the construction of the first true towns in Scotland, and these in turn allowed the establishment of several more.Oram, 192. As Prince of the Cumbrians, David founded the first two burghs of \\"Scotland\\", at Roxburgh and Berwick.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, p. 465. These were settlements with defined boundaries and guaranteed trading rights, locations where the king could collect and sell the products of his cain and conveth (a payment made in lieu of providing the king hospitality) rendered to him. These burghs were essentially Scotland's first towns.See G.W.S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland, 1000-1306, (Edinburgh. 1981), pp. 84-104; see also, Keith J. Stringer, \\"The Emergence of a Nation-State, 1100-1300\\", in Jenny Wormald (ed.), Scotland: A History, (Oxford, 2005), pp. 66-9. David would found more of these burghs when he became King of Scots. Before 1135, David laid the foundations of four more burghs, this time in the new territory he had acquired as King of Scots; burghs were founded at Stirling, Dunfermline and Edinburgh, three of David's favoured residences.Duncan, p. 265. Around 15 burghs have their foundations traced to the reign of David I, although because of the sparsity of some of the evidence, this exact number is uncertain.Stringer, \\"The Emergence of a Nation-State\\", p. 67. Regarding the uncertainty of numbers, Perth may date to the reign of Alexander I; Inverness is a case were the foundation may date later, but may date to the period of David I: see for instance the blanket statement that Inverness dates to David I's reign in Derek Hall, Burgess, Merchant and Priest: Burgh Life in the Medieval Scottish Town, (Edinburgh, 2002), compare Richard Oram, David I: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 93, where it is acknowledged that this is merely a possibility, to A.A.M. Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, p. 480, who quotes a charter indicating that the burgh dates to the reign of William the Lion. =Effect of the burghs= Perhaps nothing in David's reign compares in importance to this. No institution would do more to reshape the long-term economic and ethnic shape of Scotland than the burgh. These planned towns were or became English in culture and language; as William of Newburgh would write in the reign of King William the Lion, describing the persecution of English- speakers in Scotland, \\"the towns and burghs of the Scottish realm are known to be inhabited by English\\"A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 256. and the failure of these towns to go native would in the long term undermine the position of the Gaelic language and give birth to the idea of the Scottish Lowlands.Stringer, \\"The Emergence of a Nation-State\\", 1100-1300\\", p. 67; Michael Lynch, Scotland: A New History, pp. 64-6; Thomas Owen Clancy, \\"History of Gaelic\\", here The thesis that the \\"rise of towns\\" was indirectly responsible for the medieval flourishing of Europe has been accepted, at least in a circumscribed form, from the time of Henri Pirenne, a century ago.Henri Pirenne, Medieval cities: their origins and the revival of trade, trans. F.D. Halsey, (Princeton, 1925); Barrow, \\"The Balance of New and Old\\", p. 6. Commerce generated by and the economic privileges granted to merchant towns across northern Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries paid for, in new revenues, the increasing diversification of society and ensured that further growth would occur. What was of great importance for the future of Scotland was the creation by David of perhaps seven such jurisdictionally licensed communities at ancient royal centers and even at new sites, the latter mainly along his eastern seaboard.Oram, David I, pp. 80-82; Bartlett, The Making of Europe, pp. 176-177: \\"Scottish urban law originally derived from Newcastle upon Tyne\\". Early Scottish towns (p. 181) had mainly English immigrant populations. While this could not, at first, have amounted to much more than the nucleus of an immigrant merchant class making use of the established marketplace for the purpose of disposing of the purely local harvest, in both crop and chattels, there is a sense of profound expectation inherent in such foundations. Regional trade and international trade never lagged far behind the opening of the royal burgh to the world, and that most such burghs were kept in royal demesne meant that the king reserved the right to an excise on all transactions occurring within their bounds and to charge custom dues on those vessels taking berth in their harbours.Bartlett, The Making of Europe, p. 176: \\"Princes wanted towns, because they were profitable...\\" Religious reform The changes that David was most noted for at the time, however, were his religious changes. The reason for this is that practically all our sources were Reform-minded monks or clerics, grateful to David for his efforts. David's changes, or alleged changes, can be divided into two parts: monastic patronage and ecclesiastical restructuring. =Monastic patronage= The modern ruins of Kelso Abbey. This establishment was originally at Selkirk from 1113, but was moved to Kelso in 1128 to better serve David's southern \\"capital\\" at Roxburgh. David was certainly at least one of medieval Scotland's greatest monastic patrons. In 1113, in perhaps David's first act as Prince of the Cumbrians, he founded Selkirk Abbey for the Tironensian Order. Several years later, perhaps in 1116, David visited Tiron itself, probably to acquire more monks; in 1128 he transferred Selkirk Abbey to Kelso, nearer Roxburgh, at this point his chief residence.Oram, David I: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 62; Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, pp. 145. In 1144, David and Bishop John of Glasgow prompted Kelso Abbey to found a daughter house, Lesmahagow Priory.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, pp. 145, 150. David also continued his predecessor Alexander's patronage of the Augustinians, founding Holyrood Abbey with monks from Merton Priory. David and Bishop John, moreover, established Jedburgh Abbey with canons from Beauvais in 1138.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, p. 150. Other Augustinian foundations included St Andrew's Cathedral Priory, established by David and Bishop Robert of St Andrews in 1140, which in turn founded an establishment at Loch Leven (1150x1153); an Augustinian abbey, whose canons were taken from Arrouaise in France, was established by the year 1147 at Cambuskenneth near Stirling, another prominent royal centre.A.A.M. Duncan, \\"The Foundation of St Andrews Cathedral Priory, 1140\\", pp. 25, 27-8. However, by 23 March 1137 David had also turned his patronage towards the Cistercian Order, founding the famous Melrose Abbey from monks of Rievaulx.Richard Fawcett & Richard Oram, Melrose Abbey, p. 20. Melrose would become the greatest medieval monastic establishment in Scotland south of the river Forth. It was from Melrose that David established Newbattle Abbey in Midlothian, Kinloss Abbey in Moray, and Holmcultram Abbey in Cumberland.Fawcett & Oram, Melrose Abbey, illus 1, p. 15. David also, like Alexander, patronized Benedictines, introducing monks to Coldingham (a non-monastic property of Durham Priory) in 1139 and having making it a priory by 1149.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, pp. 146-7. David's activities were paralleled by other \\"Scottish\\" magnates. For instance, the Premonstratensian house of Dryburgh Abbey was founded in 1150 by monks from Alnwick Abbey with the patronage of Hugh de Morville, Lord of Lauderdale.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, pp. 150-1. Moreover, six years after the foundation of Melrose Abbey, King Fergus of Galloway likewise founded a Cistercian abbey from Rievaulx, Dundrennan Abbey, which would become a powerful landowner in both Galloway and Ireland and was known to Francesco Pegolotti as Scotland's richest abbey.Keith J. Stringer, \\"Reform Monasticism and Celtic Scotland\\", .pp. 128-9; Keith J. Stringer, The Reformed Church in Medieval Galloway and Cumbria, pp. 11, 35. The modern ruins of Melrose Abbey. Founded in 1137, this Cistercian monastery became one of David's greatest legacies. Not only were such monasteries an expression of David's undoubted piety, but they also functioned to transform Scottish society. Monasteries became centres of foreign influence, being founded by French or English monks. They provided sources of literate men, able to serve the crown's growing administrative needs. This was particularly the case with the Augustinians.Peter Yeoman, Medieval Scotland, p. 15. Moreover, these new monasteries, and the Cistercian ones in particular, introduced new agricultural practices. In the words of one historian, the Cistercians were \\"pioneers or frontiersmen ... cultural revolutionaries, who carried new techniques of land management and new attitudes towards land exploitation\\".Fawcett & Oram, Melrose Abbey, p. 17. Duncan calls Scotland's new Cistercian establishments \\"the largest and most significant contribution by David I to the religious life of the kingdom\\".Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, p. 148. Cistercians equated spiritual health with economic achievement and environmental exploitation. Cistercian labour transformed southern Scotland into one of northern Europe's main sources of sheep wool.See, for instance, Stringer, The Reformed Church in Medieval Galloway and Cumbria, pp. 9-11. =Bishopric of Glasgow= Almost as soon as he was in charge of the Cumbrian principality, David placed the bishopric of Glasgow under his chaplain, John, whom David may have met for the first time during his participation in Henry's conquest of Normandy after 1106.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 62. John himself was closely associated with the Tironensian Order, and presumably committed to the new Gregorian ideas regarding episcopal organization. David carried out an inquest, afterwards assigned to the bishopric all the lands of his principality, except those in the east of his principality which were already governed by the Scotland- proper based bishop of St Andrews.To a certain extent, the boundaries of David's Cumbrian Principality are conjecture on the basis of the boundaries of the diocese of Glasgow; Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 67-8. David was responsible for assigning to Glasgow enough lands directly to make the bishopric self-sufficient and for ensuring that in the longer term Glasgow would become the second most important bishopric in the Kingdom of Scotland. By the 1120s, work also began on building a proper cathedral for the diocese.G. W. S. Barrow, \\"King David I and Glasgow\\", pp. 208-9. David would also try to ensure that his reinvigorated episcopal see would retain independence from other bishoprics, an aspiration which would generate a great deal of tension with the English church, where both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York claimed overlordship.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, pp. 257-9. =Church organization= It was once held that the Scotland's episcopal sees and entire parochial system owed its origins to the innovations of David I. Today, scholars have moderated this view. Although David moved the bishopric of Mortlach east to his new burgh of Aberdeen, and arranged the creation of the diocese of Caithness, no other bishoprics can be safely called David's creation.Oram, p. 158; Duncan, Making, p. 257-60; see also Gordon Donaldson, \\"Scottish Bishop's Sees\\", pp. 106-17. The bishopric of Glasgow was restored rather than resurrected.Shead, \\"Origins of the Medieval Diocese of Glasgow\\", pp. 220-5. In the case of the Bishop of Whithorn, the resurrection of that see was the work of Thurstan, Archbishop of York, with King Fergus of Galloway and the cleric Gille Aldan.Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 173. That aside, Ailred of Rievaulx wrote in David's eulogy that when David came to power, \\"he found three or four bishops in the whole Scottish kingdom [north of the Forth], and the others wavering without a pastor to the loss of both morals and property; when he died, he left nine, both of ancient bishoprics which he himself restored, and new ones which he erected\\".A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 233. What is very likely is that, as well as preventing the long vacancies in bishoprics which had hitherto been common, David was at least partly responsible for forcing semi-monastic \\"bishoprics\\" like Brechin, Dunkeld, Mortlach (Aberdeen) and Dublane to become fully episcopal and firmly integrated into a national diocesan system.Barrow, Kingship and Unity, pp. 67-8 As for the development of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained.Ian B. Cowan wrote that \\"the principle steps were taken during the reign of David I\\": Ian B. Cowan, \\"Development of the Parochial System\\", p. 44. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanizing tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not create it.Thomas Owen Clancy, \\"Annat and the Origins of the Parish\\", in the Innes Review, vol. 46, no. 2 (1995), pp. 91-115.

A portion of the highway is overlapped by the Avenue of the Saints. Iowa 58 begins at U.S. Highway 63 (US 63) in Hudson and ends at an interchange with US 218 and Iowa 57\\\\. Iowa 58's route has changed many times in its history, but has always served Black Hawk County. Route description Iowa Highway 58 begins at the intersection of U.S. Route 63, known locally as Sergeant Road, and Hudson Road on the southern edge of Hudson. Iowa 58 passes Hudson High School and turns to the northwest through town. North of Hudson, the highway straightens to the north again and travels to a partial cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 20 (US 20). Iowa 58 turns east onto US 20 and shares the roadway for one mile (1.6 km). Iowa 58 leaves US 20 at exit 255 on the outskirts of Cedar Falls. From the opposite direction, Iowa Highway 27, the Avenue of the Saints highway, also exits US 20 and the two routes head north. For , Iowa 27 / Iowa 58 travel on a signal-controlled freeway. This is the only section of the Avenue of the Saints highway in Iowa that is controlled by traffic lights. North of Greenhill Road, the last signal- controlled intersection, Iowa 27 / Iowa 58 share a freeway. One mile (1.6 km) north of the Greenhill Road intersection is an interchange with University Avenue. East of this interchange, University Avenue is designated as Iowa Highway 934, but it is never signed as such. Iowa 27 / Iowa 58 continue north for , crossing the Cedar River near George Wyth State Park, before Iowa 58 ends at a full interchange with U.S. Route 218 and Iowa Highway 57. The US 218 interchange is also the eastern end of Iowa 57. The Avenue of the Saints highway continues north with US 218 towards Waverly. History The original Primary Road 58 connected the Jefferson Highway, now U.S. Route 65 west of Eldora to the Red Ball Route, now U.S. Route 218, east of Dysart. Primary Road 58 followed what is now Iowa Highway 175 to U.S. Route 63 to Iowa Highway 8. In the 1926 Iowa highway renumbering, Iowa 58 was truncated so that its east end was at Iowa Highway 14, and sections were renumbered Iowa 90 and Iowa 8. In March 1932, Iowa 58 extended east to Iowa Highway 137 (then Iowa Highway 59), replacing Iowa 90. In August 1932, Iowa 58 was truncated wes to Grundy Center, as Iowa Highway 57 replaced the section west of Grundy Center. In 1935, Iowa 58 extended north towards Hudson. It headed along Hudson Road and ended at US 20 on the northern edge of Cedar Falls. As a result of the highway renumbering in 1969, Iowa 58 was truncated at US 63 in Hudson, and Iowa 175 replaced the section west of Hudson (along with the section of Iowa 57 that was formerly part of Iowa 58). In the 1980s, US 20 was rerouted onto a freeway south of Cedar Falls and Waterloo. By 1989, Iowa 58's north end had been truncated to the new freeway. In the early 1990s, the freeway which Iowa 58 now shares with Iowa 27 was constructed. By 1996, it had been extended and routed onto the new Avenue of the Saints freeway, giving it its current length. The Iowa 27 designation was extended over the entire Avenue of the Saints highway in 2001.

Many Americans assumed Malta was part of Italy. In some cases \\"Born Malta, Italy\\" was put on tombstones of Maltese because of the confusion. At this time and in the nineteenth century the Maltese who emigrated to the United States were still scarce. In fact, in the 1860s, only between five and ten Maltese emigrated to the United States every year. The majority of them were agricultural workers, and, in the case of New Orleans, market gardeners and vegetable dealers. = 20th century = After World War I, in 1919, Maltese immigration to the US increased. In the first quarter of 1920 more than 1,300 Maltese immigrated to the United States. Detroit, Michigan, with jobs in the expanding automobile industry, drew the largest share of immigrants. It is believed that in the following years, more than 15,000 Maltese people emigrated to the United States, later getting U.S. citizenship. A significant percentage of early Maltese immigrants intended to stay only temporarily for work, but many settled in the US permanently. In addition to Detroit, other industrial cities such as New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago attracted Maltese immigrants. After World War II the Maltese Government committed to pay passage costs to Maltese people who wanted to emigrate and live at least two years abroad. This program led to increased emigration by the people of the island and made up approximately 8,000 Maltese who arrived to the United States between the years 1947 and 1977. Malta's government promoted Maltese emigration because Malta was overpopulated.  Demography  Estimates of the number of Maltese immigrants and their descendants living in the US by 1990 have been as high as 70,000. The majority of Americans of Maltese descent continued to live in the same cities where immigration had taken place, particularly Detroit (approximately 44,000 Maltese) and New York City (more than 20,000 Maltese); in the latter, most of the people of Maltese origin are concentrated in Astoria, Queens. San Francisco and Chicago also have significant populations. The 2013 American Community Survey estimated that there were 38,177 Americans of Maltese ancestry living in the United States. Of these, 24,202 have Maltese as their first or only ancestry.American Factfinder This includes Maltese born immigrants to the United States, their American born descendants as well as numerous immigrants from other nations of Maltese origin.  Religion  As in their country of origin, Maltese Americans predominantly practice Roman Catholicism as their religion. Many are practicing Catholics, attending church every week and actively participating in their local parishes.

Life and career  =Television= Veitch emerged from the University of Melbourne (where he completed an arts degree) sketch comedy and revue tradition. After seeing a performance of a Melbourne University Revue, producers from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1985 commissioned The D-Generation, a half-hour weekly sketch comedy series. Its immediate success resulted in a second season in 1987. Veitch performed a wide variety of characters over both seasons of the show which eventually cemented itself among the annals of Australian comedy. Veitch then went on to write and perform in the long-running sketch comedy shows Fast Forward and Full Frontal on the Seven Network between 1989 and 1995. As one of the lead performers, Veitch became known for his many skillful impersonations and characterisations of current personalities, movie and TV icons such as Sonny (Skippy parody), Clive Robertson and Clive James as well as creating a stable of original characters, particularly Wayne, the colourful airline steward which he created and performed alongside Steve Vizard.Wood, Leonie Funny Business In 2005, Veitch made a short-lived return to sketch comedy in Let Loose Live. Prior to the show's debut, Veitch had said in an interview with the Melbourne Age that \\"I think that there is a hunger for comedy. We need something to hold the mirror up and look at the familiar in a different way. So much of the world is presented to us as a kind of impervious block of information, and what satire does is say well, actually, no, you don't have to look at everything the way that society wants you to look at it.\\" From 2006 to 2009, Veitch presented ABC Television's flagship arts magazine program, Sunday Arts; ironically, this was one of the roles which he had performed in parody a decade before on Fast Forward. In 2012, Veitch starred in the award-winning short film Best Kept Secret, a mockumentary spoof on tourist promotion, filmed in Tasmania and directed by David Pyefinch.https://open.abc.net.au/posts/tassie-director- talks-about-the-best-kept-secret-49zs3hs Veitch joined the ensemble cast of the sketch comedy series Open Slather which began airing on Foxtel's The Comedy Channel in May 2015. =Books= Hailing from a family of journalists, Veitch pursued a lifelong interest in the aviation of the Second World War wrote Flak – True stories from the men who flew in World War II published in 2006 by Pan Macmillan and later, Fly: True stories of courage and adventure from the airmen of World War II published by Penguin Australia in August 2008. A third book, The Forgotten Islands, exploring the lesser-known islands of Bass Strait, was published by Penguin Australia in August 2011. In 2015, Veitch wrote Southern Surveyor, a book about the CSIRO's Marine National Facility's research vessel. Also in 2015, Veitch produced a third volume of Second World War airman stories, Heroes of the Skies, published by Penguin Books. In July 2016, he released 44 Days – 75 Squadron and the Fight for Australia through Hachette Australia. This work explores the six-week period in early 1942 when a single squadron of RAAF airmen defended Port Moresby against the ascendant Japanese. His seventh book, detailing the ordeal of an Australian airmen fighting with the French Resistance in 1944, was released by Hachette in late 2017. = Radio = In 2010, Veitch moved to Hobart, Tasmania, to host afternoons on 936 ABC Hobart local ABC radio. At the beginning of 2012, he began hosting the evening program across Tasmania. Later that year, he left ABC local radio to commence working with a theatre production, with his final broadcast occurring on 20 September 2012.Jennifer Crawley, Radio host to sign off, The Mercury, 18 July 2012 =Theatre= In 2003, Veitch played one of the lead roles in the Australian production of the musical The Full Monty, based on the 1997 film. In 2004, he starred in the musical comedy It's a Dad Thing which toured nationally. In 2009, Veitch played the lead role of Molly Meldrum in the Melbourne musical comedy Countdown, a tribute to the iconic Countdown TV show of the 1970s and '80s. Veitch was praised for his performance, one reviewer remarking (of the show's return in 2011), \\"renowned Australian actor Michael Veitch brings the role of Molly Meldrum to life – his portrayal is nothing short of outstanding. One would be forgiven for thinking that Meldrum himself was back on stage. Veitch’s imitation skills are flawless and his comic timing is second to none.\\" In 2014 and 2015, Veitch toured Australia in Flak – True stories from the men who flew in World War Two, a one-man stage version of his aviation books, in which he performs, in character, several of the men whose war stories he uncovered in his books Flak and Fly.

It is dedicated to Saint Bartholomew. It is the largest religious building in the city and a former collegiate church. Despite its common English name, it has never been a true cathedral (episcopal see), but is called the Kaiserdom (an \\"imperial great church\\" or imperial cathedral) or simply the Dom due to its importance as former election and coronation church of the Holy Roman Empire. As one of the major buildings of the Empire's history, it was a symbol of national unity, especially in the 19th century. The present church building is the third church on the same site. Since the late 19th century, excavations have revealed buildings that can be traced back to the 7th century. The history is closely linked with the general history of Frankfurt and Frankfurt's old town because the cathedral had an associated role as the religious counterpart of the Royal Palace in Frankfurt. History Frankfurt Cathedral was an imperial collegiate church, termed Dom in German - a synecdoche for all collegiate churches used totum pro parte also for cathedrals -, and thus traditionally translated as cathedral in English. St. Bartholomew's is the main church of Frankfurt and was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the Merovingian time. Since 1356, when the Golden Bull of 1356 was issued by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, emperors of the Holy Roman Empire were elected in this collegiate church as kings in Germany, and from 1562 to 1792, emperors-elect were crowned here. The imperial elections were held in the Wahlkapelle, a chapel on the south side of the choir (Hochchor) built for this purpose in 1425 (See the Plan to the right) and the anointing and crowning of the emperors-elect as kings in Germany took place before the central altar–believed to enshrine part of the head of St. Bartholomew – in the crossing of the church, at the entrance to the choir (See the Plan to the right). In the course of the German Mediatisation the city of Frankfurt finally secularised and appropriated the remaining Catholic churches and their endowments of earning assets, however, leaving the usage of the church buildings to the existing Catholic parishes. Thus St. Bartholomew's became of the city's dotation churches, owned and maintained by the city but used by Catholic or Lutheran congregations. St. Bartholomew's was seen as symbol for national unity in Germany, especially during the 19th century. Although it had never been a bishop's seat, it was the largest church in Frankfurt and its role in imperial politics, including crowning of medieval German emperors, made the church one of the most important buildings of Imperial history. In 1867, St. Bartholomew's was destroyed by a fire and rebuilt in its present style. During World War II, between October 1943 and March 1944, the old town of Frankfurt, the biggest old Gothic town in Central Europe, was devastated by six bombardments of the Allied Air Forces. The greatest losses occurred in an attack by the Royal Air Force on 22 March 1944, when more than a thousand buildings of the old town, most of them half-timbered houses, were destroyed. St. Bartholomew's suffered severe damage; the interior was burned out completely. The building was reconstructed in the 1950s. The height of the spire is 95 metres. Frankfurt Cathedral Choir School The Frankfurt Cathedral Choir School (German: Frankfurter Domsingschule), founded in 2011, is a mixed ecumenical children's and youth choir, which accompanies not only mass and evensongs, but also official receptions and openings. The Frankfurter Domsingschule offers any singer, regardless of their religious affiliation, age-based, free vocal basic training at regular rehearsals and valuable one- on-one and group vocal training or early musical education.

It begins at Iowa Highway 150 in West Union and ends at Iowa Highway 13 south of Elkader. As a largely rural route, Iowa 56 passes through the farmland of Fayette and Clayton counties. Through Elkader and to its eastern end, the highway runs parallel to the Turkey River. The highway is an original route from 1920. It originally extended from West Union to Guttenberg, but it was shortened to Elkader by 1925. Since then, both the western and eastern endpoints have shifted slightly, but the route otherwise remains the same. Route description Iowa Highway 56 begins at an intersection with Iowa 150 in the southern part of West Union. The route starts out heading to the east, but turns to the south as it leaves the city limits. Approximately south of town, it curves to the south-southeast. Southeast of West Union, Iowa 56 splits the distance between the Volga River and Echo Valley state parks, each approximately from the highway. Being a largely rural route, it passes through the rolling farmland of Fayette and Clayton counties. It continues to the south-southeast until it nears Elkader. There, it briefly turns to the northeast before turning southeast again along Second Street parallel to the Turkey River. The street plan of Elkader was influenced by the river, which flows from the northwest to southeast through town. Iowa 56 follows Bridge Street for one block; it heads to the southeast again along First Street. The highway meanders to the south, following the river, to an intersection with Iowa 13 near where that highway crosses the Turkey River. Clayton County's Turkey River Park is located at the intersection of Iowa 13 and Iowa 56. History Iowa 56 originally crossed the Turkey River in Elkader When the Iowa primary highway system was created in 1920, Primary Road No. 56 extended from West Union eastward to Guttenberg. It began in a different location in West Union than it does today, beginning at Primary Road No. 19 in the northeastern part of town. The route then headed south along Pine Street. In Elkader, Primary Road No. 56 joined Primary Roads No. 10 and No. 13 and crossed the Turkey River on the Keystone Bridge. Shortly after leaving Elkader, Primary Road No. 56 split away from the other two routes and headed east. It turned south at Primary Road No. 20 and the two routes headed to Guttenberg. The Primary Road No. 56 designation ended in Guttenberg. Primary Road No. 56's length past Elkader did not last long. By 1925, the two overlaps were removed and the standalone stretch between them was renumbered Primary Road. No. 128. By the 1950s, the western end of the route shifted to its current position in West Union. In the early 1980s, a new bypass and Turkey River bridge were built around Elkader. Iowa 13 was shifted onto the bypass and Iowa 56 was extended southward along the former Iowa 13 to the new highway. In 2004, the two intersections of Iowa 56 along Bridge Street were rebuilt to allow large trucks to take the sharp turns. Roadwork began on June 1 and the street reopened on August 4.

The route begins at the Dale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Mississippi River between Sabula and Savanna, Illinois. From Sabula, it heads north along the Mississippi towards Bellevue and Dubuque. At Dubuque, US 52 briefly shares an expressway with U.S. Route 61 and U.S. Route 151 before turning joining the Southwest Arterial, a freeway diverting traffic around the southern edge of Dubuque. West of Dubuque, the route concurrently follows U.S. Route 20 before joining Iowa Highway 136 in Dyersville. At Luxemburg, it continues north towards Guttenberg. It then heads northwest where it overlaps U.S. Route 18 for . At Calmar, US 52 turns to the north towards Decorah. US 52 crosses into Minnesota north of Burr Oak. Despite its even number, US 52 is signed as a north–south route. According to the layout of the U.S. Highway System, even- numbered routes are generally signed as east–west routes. Route description U.S. Highway 52 begins in Iowa with Iowa Highway 64 on the Dale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Mississippi River north of Sabula. After descending the bridge, the two routes turn to the south and travel along a narrow, causeway through the Mississippi backwaters. The two routes pass through Sabula, a city known as Iowa's island city, and turn west crossing another causeway to the mainland. Upon rising from the river valley, US 52 / Iowa 64 meet the northern end of U.S. Route 67. Iowa 64 continues west with US 67, while US 52 turns north to follow the river. A violin painted on a silo near Green Island, a landmark along the route Between Sabula and Bellevue, US 52 follows the course of the Mississippi River. The roadway gradually enters the Driftless Area, a region of the midwestern United States which escaped glaciation during the last glacial period. Near the unincorporated community of Green Island, the highway passes through terrain where the elevation ranges from above sea level. North of Green Island, where it crosses the Maquoketa River, US 52 follows the bluffs along the Mississippi River valley. The Canadian Pacific Railway, which runs parallel to US 52 between Green Island and Bellevue, in locations, lies below the road as the roadway follows the bluffs while the railroad tracks stay in the flat valley. At Bellevue, US 52 runs along the city's riverfront and passes Lock and Dam No. 12, intersecting with the western terminus of Iowa Highway 62. North of Bellevue, it turns to the northwest and rises in elevation and then descends at St. Donatus. North of St. Donatus, the highway travels and enters the Dubuque area and intersects U.S. Highway 61 and U.S. Highway 151. At the unincorporated community of Key West near Dubuque, US 52 north joins U.S. Highway 61 south and U.S. Highway 151 south for before exiting onto the Southwest Arterial, a , four-lane, divided freeway with priority-one access control. This connection replaces the former alignment of US 52, a particularly curvy and dangerous section of the road between Luxemburg and Dubuque. In a study conducted by the Center for Transportation Research and Education at Iowa State University, between 2002 and 2006, over 240 accidents with 6 fatalities occurred on this section, supporting its discontinuation of use as a U.S. Highway. This highway (completed in August 2020) includes a diamond interchange, allowing traffic from North English Road to enter and exit the freeway. After a roundabout intersection at the end of the arterial, US 52 passes over U.S. Highway 20 and merges onto the westbound lane of the corridor. US 52 north is co-signed with US 20 west for 20 miles, passing through the Dubuque County exurbs of Peosta, Epworth, and Farley before exiting north onto Iowa Highway 136 in Dyersville. It follows this north-south route through New Vienna, passing near the Field of Dreams filming site, until the northern terminus of Iowa 136 in Luxemberg. From Luxemburg, US 52 heads north towards Guttenberg. As it approaches the Mississippi River, the road reenters the Driftless Area. After crossing the Turkey River, the highway rises nearly in elevation before descending again at Guttenberg. North of Guttenberg, US 52 rises out of the Mississippi valley and travels west and then northwest away from the river. North of Garnavillo, it intersects Iowa 128, which serves as a cutoff to Iowa 13 near Elkader. Eight miles () later, it intersects Iowa 13 at its northern end. One mile (1.6 km) north of the Iowa 13 intersection, US 52 intersects U.S. Highway 18. Between this location and Calmar, US 52 runs parallel to the DME Railroad. The two highways travel together to the northwest for through Monona and Postville. At Postville, US 18 / US 52 intersect Iowa Highway 51. On the west side of Postville, US 52 splits away from US 18 and heads to the northwest towards Calmar. At Calmar, US 52 turns to the north at an intersection which is also the eastern end of Iowa Highway 24 and the northern end of Iowa Highway 150. It heads to the north-northeast for to an intersection with Iowa Highway 9 on the southwest side of Decorah. From Iowa 9, the route crosses the Upper Iowa River near the Luther College campus. It heads north past the unincorporated community of Burr Oak. 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Burr Oak, US 52 crosses the state line into Minnesota. History U.S. Highway 52 was designated in Iowa in 1935, replacing U.S. Highway 55 from Primary Road No. 117 near Sabula to the Minnesota state line north of Burr Oak. US 52 crossed the Mississippi River at the recently constructed Savanna–Sabula Bridge, which opened in 1932. The section of old-US 55 from Primary Road No. 117 to Dubuque was overlapped by U.S. Highway 67 until 1967 when US 67 was truncated back to the intersection with US 52 on Iowa 64. From 1963 to 1967, US 52 was realigned from Dubuque to Luxemburg to follow U.S. Highway 20 to Dyersville and Iowa Highway 136 to Luxemburg while its original alignment was rebuilt. During this time, Iowa 136, which ended at US 52 in Luxemburg, was truncated back to US 20 at Dyersville, but it was redesignated along this segment after US 52 returned to its old alignment. In the mid-1990s, US 52 / US 61 / US 151 in Dubuque were shifted onto a new expressway through downtown Dubuque, which caused the three U.S. highways to no longer intersect US 20 directly. Iowa Highway 946 was designated as a connector route to provide direct access to US 20 from the three U.S. highways. In April 2013, the city of Dubuque and surrounding jurisdictions proposed rerouting US 52 so that it would go from Luxemburg to Dyersville to meet up with US 20 and from there the highway would share an alignment with US 20 until reaching the proposed Southwest Arterial. US 52 would then be routed on to the Southwest Arterial, bypassing the city of Dubuque and heading southwest to US 61 / US 151, where it would then be linked to the existing highway US 52 on to Bellevue and Sabula. This altered designation of US 52 officially took place on August 17, 2020, with the completion of the Southwest Arterial. A new Mississippi River crossing, the Dale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge, opened on November 17, 2017.

Route description Iowa 51 is the street in the foreground in Postville. Iowa 51 begins at the intersection of Tilden and Lawler Streets in Postville. US 18 and US 52 form the southern and western forks of the intersection, Tilden Street continues east, and Iowa 51 begins heading north along Lawler Street through Postville's downtown area.

The only curves along the route come as the highway descends into and then ascends out of the Yellow River valley. Between Waukon and Decorah, the route terminates at an intersection with Iowa 9. History When it was originally designated, Iowa 51 was not a paved highway. The route was fully paved by 1935, with the segment from the Yellow River south to Postville being repaved in 1969. Its initial alignment also extended the highway into Waukon, but was shortened to end at an intersection with the old alignment of Iowa 13 (changed to Iowa 76 in 1969) on December 8, 1924.

Biography Albertanus was from Brescia, in northern Italy, but little is known of his early life. He had three sons, Vincent, Stephen, and John (who was a surgeon). He was a notary and causidici (professional legal counselor). He first appears in the historical record in 1226 as a judge renewing the Lombard League. In 1238 he was named captain to defend the town of Gavardo against the forces of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Defeated, he was imprisoned for a few months at Cremona, where he found the time to start a writing career. His first work was De amore et dilectione Dei et proximi et aliarum rerum et de forma vitae (\\"On love and delight in God and in neighbor and other matters concerning the rule of life\\"; 1238), a treatise on Christian conceptions of life under religious rule which quotes frequently from Seneca the Younger's Epistulae morales ad Lucilium (64 AD). In 1245 he wrote the treatise De doctrina dicendi et tacendi (\\"On teaching about speech and silence\\"), which discussed the place of notaries in public life, and more generally explored the newly emerging role of the professional in public life. Albertanus' best known work is Liber consolationis et consilii (\\"The book of consolation and council\\"). Written in 1246, it dramatically investigates the causes of human violence by examining the urban vendetta. Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Tale of Melibee\\" is a close translation of Renaud de Louens' Livre de Melibee et de Dame Prudence (1336) which is itself a translation of Albertanus' Liber consolationis et consilii. His last work is from 1250 and is a series of four sermons presented to his fellow causidici at Brescia, in which he explained the meaning of their rule. In total he was the author of three major treatises and five ‘sermons’, public addresses to his fellow causidici at their professional meetings. A central goal from the start for Albertanus was to present a rule of life that would lay the foundation for a good society. He believed in the importance of moral restraint based on voluntary participation in a community. Influences Albertanus read and was influenced by Seneca the Younger, Cicero, St. Augustine, the Wisdom literature of the Old Testament, and some 12th century authors. Albertanus was very influential; his works were known and used by: Brunetto Latini, John Gower, Peter Idle, Erhart Gross, Geoffrey Chaucer, Renaut de Louens, Dirc Potter, Heinrich Schlüsselfelder, Antonio de Torquemada, Jan van Boendale, archbishop Pedro Gomez Barroso of Seville, Bono Giamboni, Raimund of Béziers, Zucchero Bencivenni, the author of the Fiore di virtù, the author of the Cavallero Zifar, Guilhelm Molinier, Christine de Pizan, Jacobus von Jüterbog, Aegidius Albertinus, and Fernando de Rojas. There were many translations of his works into French, German, Tuscan, Venetian, Spanish, Catalan, and Dutch, with a wide circulation well into the 15th and early 16th centuries, a testament to his broader influence on society. The Tuscan version was made by Andrea of Grosseto, who was considered one of the first writers in the Italian language. Bibliography *James M. Powell (1992).

Though not a true recipe book, the text includes detailed instructions for making at least one Byzantine specialty (), using whipped egg whites, and a beef stew using honey, vinegar and spices. Preparations are described in more cursory terms for a number of other foods. Most of the preparations reflect Roman methods (using ingredients such as oxymel and oenomel), but the Frankish love of raw bacon is also cited. The author also specifically references whether specific foods were then available in Theodoric's region (near Metz in Northeastern France). Among other ingredients, the mention of several spices makes it clear that these were available in France long after the fall of Rome and centuries before the Crusades. As a dietetic, the text also addresses the use of foods for selected ailments such as dysentery, diarrhea, dropsy, and fever. In general, Anthimus' approach is based on humoral theory (referring for instance to \\"melancholic humours\\") though he only cites unnamed \\"authors\\" or \\"authorities\\" as his sources.

Early life Synnot was born in 1922 at Corowa, New South Wales, a descendant of Monckton Synnot, brother of Captain Timothy Monckton Synnot and a distant relative of the American Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton. Synnot was educated at Geelong Grammar School. He joined the Royal Australian Navy as a cadet midshipman in March 1939 and trained in Britain with Prince Philip of Greece (as he then was). His first ship was the cruiser HMAS Canberra. Naval career During the Second World War, Synnot served aboard the destroyer in the Battle of Cape Matapan, for which he was mentioned in despatches, and during the evacuation of Greece and Crete. With the Royal Navy, he saw service on the battleship and was on board the destroyer when she sank off Iceland in 1942 after being accidentally rammed by the battleship . Subsequently, Synnot served for two years on the Australian destroyer on North Sea convoy duty and during the North Africa landings, eventually becoming the ship's executive officer. In 1945, Synnot qualified as a gunnery officer and served on the staff of gunnery schools in Australia. Promoted to commander in 1954, he took charge of in 1956. He became captain of the Daring-class destroyer in 1960. In 1950, Synnot had taken part in the Bridgeford Mission to Malaya, which advised the Australian government on the Malayan Emergency. His report on the options for providing naval support for the British laid the foundations for Australian naval involvement in the region and led to Synnot's secondment to command the Royal Malaysian Navy from 1962 to 1965. On his return to Australia, Synnot attended administrative staff college before returning to sea in 1966 as Captain of the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Sydney, then in 1967, the carrier HMAS Melbourne. He was the only officer to command both aircraft carriers. After a year at the Imperial Defence College in London, he returned to Australia as director general of fighting equipment. Promoted to rear-admiral in 1970, he became chief of naval personnel and subsequently deputy chief of naval staff. He became Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet in 1973. In 1974, he was appointed director joint staff in the Australian Defence Department, and played a leading role in the relief effort following the devastation of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy. In 1976, Synnot was promoted to vice admiral and appointed Chief of Naval Staff. He initiated a review of the Navy Office and of the Navy's structure of command and control. He drew up a blueprint for the maintenance of naval capability into the future, and oversaw the Navy's guided-missile frigate project. Extremely able and practical, Synnot came to be regarded as one of the country's most outstanding defence force chiefs. A strong believer in deterrence and an advocate of close co-operation with America and countries in the Pacific region, Synnot emphasised the need for a strong military capability for national defence and for joint operations with Australia's allies overseas. He was said to have done more to equip Australia's armed forces with up-to-date military technology than any of his predecessors. In particular, he was instrumental in persuading the Australian government of the need to upgrade the country's air force with the acquisition of the F/A-18 Hornet. He was also behind the decision to acquire the British aircraft carrier as a replacement for the ageing HMAS Melbourne. However, Britain withdrew the offer to sell Invincible after the Falklands War. Synnot retired on 20 April 1982. Personal Synnot was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1971, and knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1978. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1976.It's an Honour – Entry He married Virginia Davenport in 1959 and they remained married until her death in 1965. He married a second time in 1968 to Anne Colvin (née Manifold), great-niece of former Prime Minister of Australia Stanley Bruce and mother of journalist Mark Colvin.

It is also the pseudonym of the band's mainstay member, Brent Griffin, whether he is performing solo or with other members. They have released two albums, Taste the Radness (2003) and Superfrenz (September 2008).  History  Spod were formed in Sydney as an indie, electro duo, first named Jizm, by Brent Griffin (later a.k.a. Spod) on guitar and keyboards, and Mike Rickards. They had attended the same secondary school. Griffin was a public servant in the New South Wales' Premier's Department and Rickards was a university student and sportsman. Griffin and Richards shared a passion for Ween's \\"Push th' Little Daisies\\" (1993), Griffin later recalled, \\"we both confessed that we loved this 'Push Th' Little Daisies' song to each other – quite sheepishly, as everyone else reacted terribly to that news. From that moment, we clicked into a high gear, decided to borrow a four track from his uni, started looping Beastie Boys beats on my CD player.\\" In 1995 the duo changed their name to Spod, as an acronym for either Special Projects Organisational Division, Spinning Pizzas of Death, or Scorpion Powers of Destruction. Their recorded output was limited to home-made cassette tapes. In 1999 Andy Clockwise joined on drums and guitar and Rickards left. Griffin related how \\"I played some two piece shows with Andy, but put it on a back burner till I decided to keep writing songs by myself at Andy's insistence. This is what drove me to move into the solo version of SPOD. Mike and Andy were my biggest influences in making me want to create music the way I do.\\" On 5 October 2002 Spod headlined a concert at Thurles Castle in Chippendale. The drunk and the legless, a four-piece guitar-based rock group from Newtown, supported them. In September 2003 the group released their first album, Taste the Radness, via Architecture Label/Spod Music and distributed by Shock Records. Griffin explained the concept of Radness, \\"It's the beatz, it's the melodies, it's eternity, it's the diamondz that pour from rainbow drenched cloudz that house armies of unicornz that sing songz of luv and triumph, woe and hizeartbreak, p and tha izarty.\\" Jody Macgregor of AllMusic observed that its \\"mixture of electroclash, rock, and juvenilia found an audience, helped by energetic and anarchic live shows featuring the rest of the enigmatically named band.\\" Taste the Radness included input from Spod's backup vocalists, dancers and choreographers, Krylon and A-Blade (collectively, the Scorpionz of Sex), specifically on the track, \\"2131 Ride Wit Me\\". This song was included on a 2004 edition of Australian Rolling Stones cover CD New Sounds. Following its release, Spod toured extensively, including a position on the Sydney leg of Big Day Out in 2004. As the year progressed, Spod began to augment his live line-up with members of the metal band, Black Level Embassy. This live set-up led to the release of an extended play, Eternal Championz, in September 2004. The EP included metal re-workings of their tracks, \\"Country of Sweden\\", \\"Secks Party 4 Eva\\" and \\"Makin' Party\\". \\"Nerdz\\" was played extensively on local radio stations, such as FBi Radio. The EP was recorded in the home of Regurgitator's Quan Yeomans. Spod and Regurgitator collaborated on joint gigs in 2004 (advertised as \\"ReSPODutator\\") and they were recorded as part of Regurgitator's project, Band in the Bubble, during that year. In March 2007 Spod played at the annual South by Southwest festival, in Austin, Texas, It was the group's first performance outside Australia. Also in that year Spod and Yeomans formed a side project, Blox, which issued a six-track EP, Quan and Spod Present Blox (8 October 2007).Blox Discography on spakatak.com Back in Sydney, Griffin was relocating to a new home when his laptop and two hard drives were damaged, \\"shattering his work and his dreams.\\" He had been working on material for Spod's second album, Superfrenz (September 2008). Dom Alessio of Mess+Noise described how \\"[he] started picking through the musical remains, discarding some songs, canvassing old and newly-created ones, and set about re-recording his whole album all over again.\\" Alessio felt, \\"[it] is ultimately a positive party album. From the playful 'Cats!' to the hip-hop drum machine onslaught of 'Time Maggots Eating the Flesh of Destiny'. Griffin’s aim is to make you forget about the darker side of life and simply have fun.\\" Polaroids of Androids Jonny attended Superfrenz album launch where, \\"[his] music sounds damn fine on record, but it is still in a live setting that it comes alive, strips down to its boxer shorts (or Ruggers) and throws streamers everywhere in a celebration of 'who gives a fuck-ness'.\\" During 2010 Griffin joined Richard in Your Mind alongside Richard Cartwright, Jordy Lane, Pat Torres and Conrad Richters, which recorded the group's second album, My Volcano (September 2010). BMA Magazines Katy Hall opined, \\"their unique blend of surf-pop and psychedelic lo-fi marks an important revival, one that not only seems to have gained gigantic momentum in recent times, but also one that clears through the often obscure genre-mixing styles of other bands of the moment.\\" Spod reissued their first album as 'Taste the Radness: the 10 Years of Radness Edition in August 2013, with bonus material on a second disc. Jasmine Crittenden of Concrete Playground noticed, \\"SPOD's getting old. And slightly blue on occasion. And he's not afraid to admit it. Back in the early noughties, he thought that happiness was all about aiming champagne corks at innocent bystanders, tossing streamers around and cranking the odd slow-grind. But the combo just isn't cutting the mustard these days.\\" She felt the album, \\"tells the story of rushing headfirst into the autumn of existence as though you were still a spring chicken, only to dislocate your hip and find yourself in an ultra cosy armchair. From that vantage point, you spend your time telling the world how much better everything was when you were able to enjoy it more.\\" It was issued via Rice Is Nice Records and according to FasterLouders Darren Levin, \\"[he] has decided to quit being a 'computer deadshit' and record a real-life album with real-life instruments in a real- life studio with real-life producer Owen Penglis (The Straight Arrows).\\" Spod issued a single, \\"Boys Night\\", in December 2016.

His various credits in the field of journalism, include senior editing positions for Christian Music related websites About Christian Music, CMCentral.com, and writing credits among the likes of Christian Musician Magazine, CCM Magazine, and others. In January 2004, Parrish created the website Infuze Magazine, which claimed to be a unique mixture of the concepts Art and Faith. In 2008, he co-created PopCultureGeek.com, a website devoted to fandom and all the things pop culture fans are most passionate about. Biography Robin Parrish was born in Thomasville, North Carolina, to Michael Wayland Parrish and Lutricia Jones Parrish. His earliest writing efforts took place on a plastic, toy typewriter, and resulted in several \\"books\\" (most between 10 and 30 pages long) and even a few magazines. By the age of thirteen, he had begun winning local writing awards and became a regular in his high school's literary magazine. In college, he garnered acclaim from his English professors and fellow students while maturing and honing his skills. It was his own website creation Infuze, that led to becoming a published author. One of his more \\"high concept\\" ideas for Infuze was to return to his love for storytelling and create a serialized tale that would play out every two weeks, telling a complete, compelling story over the course of nine months. That serialized story eventually came to the attention of several publishers, who saw it as a potential debut novel for Robin Parrish. In 2005, Bethany House Publishers brought Parrish full circle by contracting him for the rights to not only that first book—but two sequels. A trilogy, to unfold in the consecutive summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008. One massive tale—of which that first, original story would form only the foundational first volume of the three—spread across three books. Books As a novelist, Parrish is the author of Bethany House Publisher's Dominion Trilogy. The first entry, Relentless, was released on [July 1], [2006].Amazon Book 2, Fearless, on [July 1], [2007],Amazon with Book 3, Merciless, was released on July 2008. His next novel is said to be a straightforward science fiction tale set on Earth in the near future. Tentatively titled Offworld, the novel will be a standalone book, not part of any series. His book after Offworld was a horror book based in the field of paranormal hunting, titled \\"Nightmare\\", also a standalone book. Parrish plans no further trilogies or series for the foreseeable future, but is currently contracted for at least three new novels from 2009 to 2011.

Early life  Malcolm McKenzie was born in Kincardine, Ontario, in 1863. He attended Queen's University, from which he graduated with a gold medal in philosophy, and then studied for a year in Toronto, Ontario. He came west around 1888 and, after a brief stay in Calgary, Alberta, settled in Fort Macleod, Alberta, where he joined the law firm Haultain, McKenzie and McNeill. That firm dissolved when its senior partner, Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, went to Regina to serve as the first Premier of the Northwest Territories. McKenzie established another law firm with John McDonald and another lawyer; that firm was called McDonald, Martin and McKenzie.  Political career  McKenzie first sought office in the 1904 federal election, when he ran as the Liberal candidate in Alberta (Provisional District). He was narrowly defeated by John Herron of the rival Liberal- Conservative Party. McKenzie then ran in the 1905 Alberta election, the province's first, as the Liberal candidate in Macleod, where he handily defeated his two opponents. In the first legislature he, along with most members from the province's south, favoured Calgary over Edmonton as the Alberta's permanent capital; his side was out-voted 16 to 8.Thomas 38 He also proposed the successful name for Granum, located in his district and hitherto known as Leavings Switch; the area around Granum was known as excellent grain land, and \\"granum\\" is Latin for grain. In the 1909 election, McKenzie was re- elected in the new district of Claresholm, by a margin still larger than the one he had achieved in 1905. During the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal, he remained loyal to the Liberal government of Alexander Cameron Rutherford; when that government fell, he transferred his allegiance to the new Liberal government of Arthur Sifton, though several other former Rutherford partisans (including Rutherford himself) opposed the new regime.Thomas 113 His loyalty was rewarded in May 1912 when Sifton appointed him Provincial Treasurer.Thomas 125 In keeping with the era's custom, McKenzie responded to the cabinet appointment by resigning his seat in the legislature to contest it in a by-election. Despite his previous wide margins, in 1912 he carried Claresholm by only 14 votes.Thomas 127 McKenzie's tenure as treasurer was not to last long: he caught a chill while attending the convention that nominated him as the Liberals' Claresholm candidate in the 1913 election, and by the time he returned to Edmonton on March 10, 1913, he was sufficiently ill to confine himself to bed. He had developed peritonitis, and died from it early in the morning of March 15. The Liberal Edmonton Bulletin, in mourning his passing, said that \\"no lawyer in the province had such a firm grasp in legal matters. No member of the house performed his legislative duties so admirably and so well. He has left his impression on more legislation than any other member.\\" He was survived by a wife and one son.

History Local church Dynów was first mentioned in written sources in 1423. At that time, together with other villages, it belonged to the noble Kmita family from Lesser Poland. In 1409, after the death of Voivode of Kraków, Piotr Kmita, the village was handed to his son, Piotr Lunak, who died in 1430. Dynów was granted town charter probably before 1429. In 1448, it became seat of a Roman Catholic parish, but remained a small town, located in the Ruthenian Voivodeship (part of Red Ruthenia) of the Kingdom of Poland. In March 1657, Dynów was captured by Transilvanian army of George II Rakoczi, which burned the town, together with its churches and castle. In 1661, Dynów was plundered again, this time by mercenaries of Mikolaj Ossolinski, who fought his private war with owner of Dynow, Olbracht Grochowski. In 1667, the town was purchased by Castellan of Przemyśl, Marcin Konstanty Krasicki. Following the first partition of Poland (1772) Dynów was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained in Austrian Galicia until 1918. In the second half of the 19th century, a brewery and a small oil refinery were opened here. Most of Dynów's residents were artisans, including masons, carpenters and weavers. In 1904, a narrow gauge rail line to Przeworsk was completed. In 1785, the town had 2,203 inhabitants. Among them 67,5% were Polish, 26,8% Jewish and 5,4% Ukrainian. According to the 1921 census, the population of Dynów amounted to 2,727 – 51,3% Poles, 46,7% Jews and 2% Ukrainians.Wacław Wierzbiniec. Z dziejów społeczności żydowskiej Dynowa. Mitel. 2003. pp. 16, 34 After World War I, Dynów returned to newly restored Poland, and until 1939, belonged to Lwów Voivodeship. In 1919, it lost its town charter. On September 13, 1939, the village was captured by German 5th Infantry Division (see Invasion of Poland). During World War II, Dynów was an important center of the Home Army. During the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, Wehrmacht soldiers on the first day of Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah) mass murdered 200 Jewish civilians from the town. 150 Jews were mass murdered by machine guns after being taken away from the town on trucks. 50 Jews were burned alive in their prayer house.Szymon Datner \\"55 dni Wehrmachtu w Polsce\\" page 392 In 1946, Dynów regained its town charter.

It was an Italian and Yugoslavian co-production directed by Alberto Lattuada, starring Suzy Kendall and Kenneth More, and featuring Capucine, James Booth, Giancarlo Giannini and Nigel Green. It was produced by Dino De Laurentiis and has a music score by Ennio Morricone. It was distributed by Paramount Pictures in the United States. Plot A woman spy and some male agents working for the Germans during World War I land at night near the British naval base at Scapa Flow, from a U-boat. The British, led by Col. Foreman, ambush the landing party, capturing two of the men, but the woman gets away. Foreman fakes the execution of one of the spies, thus tricking the second one, Meyer, into becoming a double agent in the hopes of using him to capture his woman accomplice, whom Meyer identifies under the codename Fraulein Doktor. Fraulein Doktor is portrayed as a brilliant spy who stole a formula for a skin blistering gas similar to mustard gas which the Germans used to great effect against the Allies on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Fraulein Doktor seduces a laundryman to find out which ship Lord Kitchener will be sailing on to Russia, and when it will sail. She then helps a German U-boat to sink HMS Hampshire outside Scapa Flow with Kitchener on it, taking his life. For this, she is awarded the Pour Le Merite. Meyer re-appears in Berlin and courts her. The German intelligence service is suspicious of Meyer's escape from the British, but use him to poison Fraulein Doktor because of her addiction to morphine. Meyer is shown her dead body and later makes his way back to the British to confirm her death. However, Fraulein Doktor's death was faked for Meyer's benefit so she would be free of suspicion for her next assignment, getting Allied defense plans for a German attack in Belgium. Under cover as a Spanish contessa, she recruits Spanish nurses to staff a hospital train to serve the Allied front. During the trip from Spain to France, she brings aboard German agents who will impersonate Belgian officers to penetrate Belgium Army headquarters and steal the plans. Col. Foremen is still not convinced of her death and shows up at the same army headquarters with Meyer in tow. The German agents steal the plans and in a deadly shootout with sentries, one gets away back to German lines. The Germans then launch their attack with great success, but Col. Foreman confronts Fraulein Doktor. Meyer kills Foreman but is in turned killed by the advancing German troops. Fraulein Doktor is then whisked away by the Germans, but suffers a breakdown as she is being driven off through all the carnage and death about her.

The single aims were to secure the withdrawal of British troops from Ireland and self-determination for the Irish people as a whole. This required other demands such as the demilitarisation of the local police and paramilitary police support (the B Specials) as well as opposition to UK Government policies that maintained discrimination against Catholic people in areas such as elections, housing, education, cultural pursuits, jobs and social welfare. This led TOM to seek partnerships and joint working with like-minded organisations in the UK, Ireland and internationally. As the political and civil defence situation (Catholics defending their areas from the police, their official paramilitary arm and unofficial paramilitary groups drawn from the Unionist organisations) developed in Northern Ireland (six of nine counties of the region of Ulster partitioned off by the British in 1921), the TOM became closely linked to Sinn Féin. The TOM trod a path to distance itself from the Provisional IRA while simultaneously claiming that armed struggle was a reasonable choice by oppressed Irish people in response to their experiences of struggling against the policies and actions of British governments and their Unionist allies in Northern Ireland. TOM's two demands, \\"British troops out of Ireland\\" and \\"self-determination for the Irish people as a whole\\" were based on the removal of the British political and military presence in Ireland, as they considered that this was fundamental to a peaceful solution to the Troubles, and that only when that happens could the people of Ireland truly determine their own future. However, the 1998 Good Friday Agreement recognised \\"Northern Ireland’s status as part of the United Kingdom\\" and declared \\"that it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of its people\\".Clause 1(iii)  Origins  The movement was founded in west London in late 1973. Its first main event, a large public meeting, took place at Fulham Town Hall in 24 October 1973. By the end of the year there were branches in Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham and north and south London. By 1975 the TOM claimed to have a membership of over 1,200 people. The TOM was a 'single issue' organisation, but its membership generally comprised people who were also members of left-wing, socially progressive and humanitarian organisations. This shaped its campaigns but also caused some friction with views of the various groups it worked with in Ireland; this was particularly true for issues such as women's liberation, gay rights and anti-racism. The TOM campaigned very actively across UK politics, drawing lessons from British action over Ireland and the way it shaped events and approaches by successive governments in Britain. This saw TOM creating solidarity links with many political, social and cultural events in the UK among Britain's Irish communities, Trade Unions. Faith Groups, anti-Nazi and anti-racist groups, international support groups, etc. The TOM provided a resource for people who wanted to learn about Britain's role in Ireland, including public meetings, conferences, concerts, a UK-wide branch meeting structure, frequent demonstrations and protests in every major UK city, annual and other delegations to Northern Ireland, managed visits to Ireland, publications, etc. Notably TOM organised \\"Black Flag\\" protests on the day every Hunger Striker died. By the 1990s TOM recognised both the value and limitations of the Good Friday Agreement; endorsing the issues of justice, policing, equality, demilitarisation, employment discrimination, cultural rights and the Irish language, while also highlighting sectarian attacks on nationalist communities from loyalist paramilitaries. Increasingly the TOM campaigned against the policies and actions of the Irish Republic as these became linked to those of the British government, including the shoot-to-kill policy, use of torture, false imprisonment, covert military and paramilitary actions, abuse of informers to frame the innocent, and manipulation of the media to misreport events. They protested for the immediate end to the use of rubber and plastic bullets. Since the relative peace in Northern Ireland following the Good Friday Agreement and ceasefires, TOM activity declined. By the mid-2000s very few, if any active branches existed, the monthly TOM paper ceased and the ad- hoc on-line briefing had also stopped. One notable member of the TOM was Paddy Prendiville, who later went on to edit the satirical magazine The Phoenix.

Fictional character biography In the 2002 remake of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, it is revealed that Castle Grayskull was once home to King Grayskull, an ancestor of Prince Adam and Princess Adora. He appears in the episode, \\"The Power of Grayskull\\", waging battle and ultimately defeating the Snake Men led by King Hiss but lost his sword in battle. He hoped it to be a sign that it signified true peace for Eternia. However, Hiss' rival Hordak, who had defeated the Snake Men, was planning on conquering Eternia. Therefore, Grayskull went on a quest to find the power he needed to defend his kingdom. At the top of a mountain, he met the oracle who guided him on his quest, showing him his lost sword and explaining that his entire quest was to show his inner strength. Before leaving however, the Oracle informed him that he would not survive the battle. Despite knowing this, King Grayskull vowed to do whatever it took to save Eternia. He then returned to face Hordak. Though outnumbered, Grayskull managed to channel his mystical energies through his sword, turning Hordak's spell on himself and his army, sending them to the dark dimension called Despondos. Despite this victory however, the Oracle's prophecy came to pass, for Hordak, whose spirit/soul was ripped from his body, managed to mortally wound Grayskull. As he lay dying, he proclaimed that his successor will wield his sword to defend Eternia. During his lifetime, King Grayskull ruled with wisdom and compassion. Upon his death, King Grayskull transferred his mystical energies into his Power Sword which now forms the basis of He-Man's power, thus the transformation cry \\"By the power of Grayskull!\\", (at least in this version) refers to the king, not the castle. His wife, Queen Veena, became the first Sorceress and his advisers became the Council of Elders, who were empowered by his sword. The Sorceress first introduced the story to Prince Adam by showing him a previously unrevealed statue of his titanic ancestor inside the bowels of Castle Grayskull. King Grayskull's character design was originally an early prototype for He-Man himself. His appearance is largely the same as He-Man's but with much more exaggerated muscular body proportions resulting in an enormous stature, with long hair gathered into loose ponytails framing his face, and wearing a long brown cape with fur-topped shoulders. The producers liked it enough that they decided to use it for King Grayskull. Whereas He-Man rides the green tiger Battle Cat, King Grayskull rode an even larger giant green lion, and during his war with the Snake Men he was shown also wearing the same \\"Snake Armour\\" He-Man used in the second season. King Grayskull was voiced by Cam Clarke, He-Man's voice actor for the 2002 series. The packaging for the King Grayskull action figure included a short character biography that largely recounted the aforementioned story from the 2002 series, but also included the additional information that Grayskull had fought alongside He-Ro (implicitly the Preternia version), a fact – and character – unmentioned in the cartoon. This information, as well as the inclusion of classic rather than 2002-style accessories, seemed to indicate that the toy of King Greyskull represents a hitherto nonexistent version of the character situated in the classic 1980's continuity as opposed to the 2002 remake. This would prove to be partly true, as the character bios on subsequent releases in the MOTU Classics line indicate that the new figure line is using a new continuity which melds story elements from various different incarnations of the franchise, including the 2002 series' backstory. King Grayskull's bio read as follows *NOTE: His story is the beginning of new Classic's storyline that is being told through the bios on card backs of the exclusively on-line series of figures* Long before Prince Adam held the Sword of Power to become He-Man, his ancestor, King Grayskull defended Eternia from evil. Heroically mastering the secret power of his sword, Grayskull fought side-by-side with the cosmic warrior He-Ro against both the evil Hordak and King Hssss. Although Grayskull eventually fell before Hordak’s magic, he was able to preserve his powers inside the sword, so that one day his descendants could reclaim the power and call upon Grayskull's name whenever evil threatens the peace of Eternia. To this day, Grayskull’s spirit remains hidden away deep inside the castle which will forever bear his name. Grayskull's name is mentioned in the 2018 remake.

Weekdays begin with \\"The Morning Rush\\" featuring Jonathan Rush and Kelly Nash. Overnights, WCOS-FM carries the nationally syndicated \\"CMT After Midnite.\\" WCOS-FM is South Carolina's primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System. History WCOS-FM signed on in March 1951 as the sister station of AM 1400 WCOS. It was Columbia's second FM station and originally broadcast on 97.9 MHz. Prior to 1963, it was on the air only during the evening hours. The separate programming featured Broadway showtunes, opera and classical music, along with news from the ABC Radio Network. In the fall of 1963, the station began broadcasting in FM stereo and the hours were extended to the daytime. The morning show was a simulcast of 1400 WCOS, which was hosted by Bob Fulton, the long-time announcer for University of South Carolina Gamecocks football. After 9 am, the format was easy listening and beautiful music. The music was broadcast in mono until 6 pm, converting to stereo for the evening hours. In the late 1960s, WCOS-FM converted to a progressive rock format. Prior to the change, the station promoted the new format by announcing frequently that WCOS-FM was \\"going underground.\\" By 1973, the station changed to country, adopting its longtime slogan \\"The Great 98.\\" The country format has remained since. In 1991, the station upgraded its signal by changing the frequency from 97.9 MHz to 97.5 MHz and increasing its power to 100,000 watts. That made it one of the strongest FM signals in the Columbia radio market. In 1997, WCOS- AM-FM were acquired by Capstar, Inc.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-397 Then in 2000, Capstar, including WCOS-AM-FM, were acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-458 Clear Channel changed its name to iHeartMedia in 2014.

Monster in the Night and Stranger on the Campus) is a 1958 American black-and-white science fiction/horror film from Universal- International, produced by Joseph Gershenson, directed by Jack Arnold, from a script by David Duncan, \\"'Vampire' in Attack Today\\" Los Angeles Times 22 Oct 1958: B8. that stars Arthur Franz, Joanna Cook Moore, Nancy Walters, Troy Donahue, and Whit Bissell. The film was theatrically released as a double feature with the British horror film Blood of the Vampire. The film's storyline tells of a university science professor who accidentally comes into contact with the irradiated blood of a coelacanth, which causes him to \\"regress\\" to being a primitive caveman.  Plot  Dr. Donald Blake (Arthur Franz), a science professor at Dunsford University, receives delivery of a coelacanth. A student, Jimmy (Troy Donahue), asks Blake if the fish is really a million years old. Blake replies, \\"It's the species that's old. No change in millions of years. See, the coelacanth is a living fossil, immune to the forces of evolution\\". Blake lectures his students about evolution and devolution, telling them that man is the only creature that can decide whether to move forwards or backwards, and that \\"unless we learn to control the instincts we've inherited from our ape-like ancestors, the race is doomed\\". Inside the lab, Blake scratches himself on its teeth of the Partially-thawed coelacanth, accidentally sticking his bloody hand into the water-filled container which held the fish. Molly Riordan (Helen Westcott), assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver (Whit Bissell), is with Blake and offers him a ride home. When they get to Molly's car, Blake says he doesn't feel well and passes out. At Blake's home, Molly is attacked by person or persons unknown. Madeline Howard (Joanna Moore), Blake's fiancée and daughter of Dr. Gilbert Howard (Alexander Lockwood), president of the university, arrives and finds the home in shambles and Blake moaning on the ground. Madeline calls the police after seeing Molly hanging by her hair in a tree, her eyes wide, dead. Detective Lt. Mike Stevens (Judson Pratt) and Detective Sgt. Eddie Daniels (Ross Elliott) find a huge \\"deformed\\" hand print on a window and Blake's tie clasp in Molly's dead hand. They take Blake downtown when he admits that he can't remember anything after getting into Molly's car. Stevens releases Blake after concluding that someone is holding a grudge and trying to implicate Blake in Molly's murder. He assigns Daniels as Blake's bodyguard and tells Blake that Molly's autopsy showed she died of fright. In his lab, Blake shoos away a dragonfly that lands on the coelacanth. The dragonfly later returns, now grown to two feet. Blake and Jimmy try to catch the giant insect with a net when, again, it lands on the coelacanth. Blake stabs the dragonfly. When he examines its body, he doesn't notice that its blood has dripped into his pipe. Lighting up and taking a few puffs, he immediately feels ill. As the dragonfly shrinks back to its normal size, a large, hairy hand reaches out and squashes the insect. Then Blake's lab is trashed and Jimmy's visiting girlfriend is killed. The police find huge footprints near her body and conclude that the footprints and the hand prints are from the same source. Blake learns that the coelacanth has blood plasma preserved by gamma rays. If it gets into the bloodstream of an animal or person, it causes them to temporarily revert to a more primitive state. He realizes that he might have received a dose of the irradiated plasma. If so, then Blake has been reverting to a throwback caveman with large hands, feet, dark skin, heavy body hair, and prominent brow ridges. He decides to take a few days off at Dr. Howard's remote cabin. Blake isn't there for rest and relaxation: He plans to learn whether he is the beast. Blake rigs the cabin with cameras on trip wires to record whatever happens and injects himself with coelacanth plasma. His caveman self wrecks the room, trips the camera's wires, and is photographed. He grabs an axe and leaves. Madeline, driving to the cabin, runs off the road and crashes when the caveman appears in her headlights. Local forest ranger (Richard H. Cutting) arrives and calls the Dunsford police for help. The caveman carries the unconscious Madeline into the forest, with the ranger in pursuit. Madeline comes to and struggles with the beast. When she breaks free, the forest ranger shoots the caveman, but he throws his axe, killing the ranger. Madeline runs to the cabin. The caveman collapses. Blake, once again himself, returns to the cabin and develops a photo, showing it to Madeline, who does not understand and asks why the beast is wearing Blake's clothes. Lt. Stevens, Detective Sgt. Powell (Phil Harvey), and Dr. Howard arrive at the cabin. Blake tells them that he not only knows who the murderer is, but where to find him. Out in the woods, he explains to Howard what his experiment proved and injects himself with coelacanth plasma. Again transformed into the caveman, he chases Howard, forcing the two detectives to shoot him. As the beast lies dying, he slowly transforms back into Blake.

The on-campus scenes of Dunsford University were filmed at Occidental College in Eagle Rock, a suburb of Los Angeles, California. The working title of the film was Monster in the Night. Although Universal music director Joseph Gershenson had received executive producer credit on some films of the 1940s, Monster on the Campus marked the first film for which he received sole credit as producer.Monster on the Campus TCM Notes This was the film debut of Nancy Walters. Arthur Franz only played Prof. Donald Blake. Once the makeup transformation scenes were over, stuntman Eddie Parker did every scene as the monster.Internet Movie Database Trivia Science fiction film critic Bill Warren writes that director Jack Arnold said in an interview with Cinefastastique magazine (Vol.4 No.2, 1975) that the film was shot in 12 days, and that Arnold told Photon magazine (No.26, 1975), \\"I didn't really hate it, but I didn't think it was up to the standards of the other films that I have done\\". Reception Monster on the Campus had a wide international release. Its U.S. premiere was in Bismarck, North Dakota on 17 December 1958, followed by Finland on 1 May 1959, West Germany on 22 January 1960, France on 27 January 1960, and Mexico on 3 March 1960. The film was also released in the UK, Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Soviet Union, Argentina, and Brazil. In the UK, it was given an \\"X\\" certificate by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), which meant at the time that the film could not be exhibited to people under age 16. In 2016, BBFC reclassified the DVD of Monster on the Campus. It now has a PG rating. According to Warren, there were few reviews of Monster on the Campus when it first came out because it was the \\"bottom half of a double-bill with the more colorful Blood of the Vampire\\". He quotes a few contemporary reviews. It was called \\"'a pretty fair shocker'\\" in Daily Variety. Jack Moffitt, in The Hollywood Reporter, said the film emphasized the \\"'human rather than the monstrous side of this modern 'Dr. Jekyll' story\\". The Monthly Film Reporter, however, called it \\"'depressing,'\\" even though it had been \\"'tailored for the horror market.'\\" BoxOffice magazine in its issue of 19 January 1959 showed positive reviews from most of the publications listed in its \\"Review Digest\\". BoxOffice, Film Daily, and The Hollywood Reporter all rated it as \\"very good\\"; Harrison's Report and Variety rated it \\"good\\"; Parents' Magazine gave it a \\"fair\\" rating; and the New York Daily News had not reviewed the film. The reviewing division of the Catholic News Service evaluated Monster on the Campus in 1958 for its \\"artistic merit and moral suitability\\". This resulted in The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) giving the film a rating of \\"A-III,\\" which meant it was suitable for adults, although USCCB cautioned that it contained \\"stylized violence with some intense menace\\". Many of the more recent reviews have centered on the monster/caveman/ape-man makeup. Warren writes, \\"The mask is unconvincing, with tiny shell-like teeth and a built-in scowl; it resembles similar Universal-International over-the-head masks of the period, as seen in Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Tarantula and other outings\\". Bryan Senn notes that keeping the monster off-camera until near the end of the film is a good idea, as it adds a \\"bit of build-up and mystery\\", but doing so \\"only makes the rubbery mask and hirsute padded shoulders (making him look like a simian linebacker) that much more disappointing when finally revealed\\". But reviews have noted more than just makeup. Phil Hardy writes that \\"cinematographer [Russel] Metty and special effects man [Clifford] Stine make the most of the ape-man's path of destruction through the campus but the script lacks any sparkle\\". Senn calls the film \\"visually flat, with the 'action' taking place in labs, offices and cabins, and with exteriors consisting of one back-lot hillside\\". And Warren says that the film is \\"hampered by trivial locations and drab sets. The film has no arresting images. The best [Arnold] can come up with is a swift glance the ape-man gives a mirror before smashing it and one shot of a woman dangling by her hair from a tree\\". In summary, he calls the film \\"routine, unimaginative and foolish ... Jack Arnold's worst science fiction film\\". But not every reviewer disliked Monster on the Campus. Critic Ken Hanke wrote that \\"part of the charm of this little movie is that the monster is so hokey. No, it's not classic horror, but it's a good bit of fun\\". He gave the film a score of 4.5 out of 5 stars. Popularity with the public is harder to judge. The film holds a 5.8/10 from 1,111 votes on the Internet Movie Database and a low 22% from 270 viewers at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.Rotten Tomatoes  Academic interest  Monster on the Campus has attracted a fair amount of academic interest. Prof. Cyndy Hendershot in 2001 wrote that the film examines \\"issues of conformity and individuality\\" through a \\"metaphor of monstrous transformation\\". Hendershot says that while Blake the professor represents conformity, Blake the caveman is a representation of individuality. But he can't be conformist and individualistic at the same time. His employer, Dunsfield University, \\"conspires to stamp out individuality that does not follow the direction of the organization as a whole\\". That is, \\"while Monster on the Campus adopts the typical sf/horror plot of the mad scientist versus the blind authorities\\", the film \\"frames the issue specifically within the world of the organization man\\". According to Hendershot, a man such as Blake - driven from within toward individualism and not at all a good organization man who willingly submits to conformity imposed on him from the outside - can't win. His personal goal of knowledge for the sake of knowledge is not that of the university, which seems more interested in the publicity that owning a rare coelacanth will bring. \\"But, if the film condemns the other-directed society as stifling scientific knowledge, it equally condemns Blake's rampant inner-directed man. It reveals, in fact, that the individual within is a beast\\". Also in 2001, Hendershot looked at Monster on the Campus as an exploration of a \\"wide variety of issues related to the emergence of teen culture in Fifties America\\". Specifically, her focus is on juvenile deliquency, which she says \\"provoked feelings of intense horror\\" in adults at the time. The Dunsfield Police, for example, \\"suspect the teenagers on campus of being guilty\\" of the murders of Molly and Daniels, yet the \\"true criminal is located at the heart of adult authority on campus\\". But unlike many films in which young people are the villains, Monster on the Campus inverts things, so that \\"only the students emerge as having any clear moral sense about the horrors that are occurring on campus\\". In other words, \\"the kids in Monster on the Campus are fine; it's the adults that have to be watched, as they may transform into monsters at any moment\\". Prof. Patrick Gonder looks at the film in racial terms. He writes that Monster on the Campus was released just a few years after the 1954 US Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. In that light, he says, \\"the monster on the campus is the demonized black male student, threatening to contaminate the purity of white women and cause the reversal of white evolutionary potential. The Caveman is imaged as a racist caricature of the African American: bestial, violent and corrosive to the tenets of white society\\". However, Gonder goes on to point out that the \\"creature and the professor are one and the same: several times, Blake comments on how the beast is 'within' him\\". And at the end of the film Blake solves his problem: he \\"does not turn himself in but instead organizes his own lynch mob by purposefully (for the first time) transforming himself into the Caveman, thus forcing the police officers to shoot him\\". Home media Monster on the Campus had its U.S. VHS release in 1994. Universal Pictures released Monster on the Campus as part of a DVD boxed set called The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection, which features four other Universal films: The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Mole People, The Monolith Monsters, and Tarantula. Shout Factory released the film on Blu-ray in a package including the trailer and subtitles on 25 June 2019.https://www.amazon.com/Monster- Campus-Blu-ray-Arthur-Franz/dp/B07PDTXFKV Retrieved 30 July 2019 Popular culture Monster on the Campus has been referenced in a number of other films and television programs. Among other examples, it was shown on Svengoolie in 1981 and 2013; scenes from it were used in the films Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and American Grindhouse (2010); and it was mentioned in the Canadian comedy Ding et Dong le film (1990). In music, The Modern Airline, a neo-New Wave band from Brooklyn, New York, released a song titled \\"Monster on the Campus\\" in 2017.

In this manifestation, Obatala is a youth who battles with a scimitar. He is credited with having spread gunpowder throughout the world. In addition, he traveled to Asia, where he warred against and defeated his enemies, taking their heads with him as evidence of his destruction. The normally peaceful and calm Obatala manifests a fierceness and thirst for peace by way of domination in this aspect. In the Lukumi system, Ayagunna can turn out to be one's governing orisha. His receptacle contains the requisite items of Obatala as well as additional ones that are designated only to that path. When one receives Ochanla, one must already be in possession of Ayagunna or receive him along with her. Although Obatala eats female animals due to his duality and age, after receiving Ochanla, the adherent must feed Ayagunna male animals and Ochanla female. Ayagunna is often envisioned in a similar fashion to Shango. He is a member of the fun-fun (white) court of Obatala as a divine king, as are all of his other manifestations. When his adherents manifest his energies during religious trance sessions, Ayagunna behaves with swift, strong, and battle-like movements. Hence, he is the paladin among orishas. His children are often mistaken for children of Shango. Ayagunna wears all white with the exception of a diagonal red sash that bisects his tunic. The patakis or stories of the faith state that Olofin put Ayagunna in charge of bringing order to the earth since man had been left to his own devices. At first, Ayagunna asked the people to bring their lives in line with the laws of Olofi, but they ignored his requests. After a while, Ayagunna grew less and less patient and finally stopped making requests and took more punitive measures by executing those who refused to obey. Word got back to Olofi, and he traveled to our world from Ara Onu to see for himself what Ayagunna had wrought. When Ayagunna saw Olofi coming, he wiped his scimitar across his chest to clean the blood from its blade. Olofi scolded Ayagunna for causing such confusion, but Ayagunna then responded in a lawyerly fashion: \\"Father, without conflict, there can be no progress\\". Olofi considered his words and agreed. Ayagunna is also known for being the breeder of conflict and war. His name literally means \\"war dog\\". Ayagunna said the day he lays down his sword, the world will cease to exist. Ayagunna is a Spanish mispronunciation of the proper Yoruba Ajaguna. In Spanish, the j sounds like a y.

(orig. Ti piace Hitchcock?) is a 2005 made-for-TV giallo film directed by Dario Argento. The film is a homage to the acclaimed thriller film director Alfred Hitchcock. Plot Giulio, a film student, spies on Sasha, an attractive neighbor, and rents Fritz Lang films for his thesis. He sees Sasha at the video store. She tries to rent Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train at the same time as another woman, Federica. The two strike up a friendship. The next day, riding his bicycle, Giulio sees Sasha and Federica having furtive conversation by a fountain. An intruder uses a key to enter Sasha's apartment while her mother is home alone and murders her with a brass pestle. Giulio is awakened that night by the police investigation as they question Sasha. Reading the newspaper, Giulio finds out that Sasha Zerboni was an only child and her mother was a rich widow. Giulio tells his girlfriend Arianna that he suspects Sasha and Federica are in an agreement similar to the one in Strangers on a Train. Giulio goes across the street and finds a cleaning crew mopping up the crime scene. He snatches a letter out of the mailbox: a bank statement showing almost 1 million Euros in the Zerboni account. Back at his apartment, his mother tells him about her new fiancé. Upon Sasha's return, the cleaning crew chief tells her about Giulio's visit. Someone breaks into Giulio's apartment. The intruder breaks an empty wine bottle and flees when Giulio hears the noise. Giulio calls Arianna and asks her to spend the night because he's nervous. When Giulio hypothesizes that it is Sasha's turn to kill someone close to Federica (à la Strangers on a Train), Arianna says he is crazy. The next day, the video store clerk, Andrea, tells Giulio Sasha had been in and asked about him, saying she knew he watched her. The following day, Andrea asks Giulio to mind the video store while he steps out. While Andrea is away, he looks up Federica's address on the store computer. Giulio rides his motorbike to Federica's apartment and follows her to her workplace. At the end of the day, Federica disconsolately leaves with her boss. Giulio follows them to the boss's apartment and sees them arguing in a second floor window. The boss is blackmailing Federica for sexual favors over money she stole from a client. He spots Giulio looking through the window. Giulio scampers back down the ledge, but falls and fractures his ankle. He limps to his motorbike, barely escaping. The doctor tells Giulio he'll have to be in a cast for several weeks. Arianna comes over to help him mend. When he tells her his theory that Federica wants Sasha to kill her boss, Arianna says he's crazier than ever and storms out. Andrea comes by, ostensibly to visit Giulio while he's laid up, and tries to drown him in the tub. While Giulio and Andrea are struggling, Giulio's mother and her fiancé come to visit. Hearing the screams, the fiancé breaks down the door and pulls Andrea off Giulio. Andrea flees into the street and is fatally hit by a car. The police arrest Sasha. Arianna comes over and she and Giulio make up. Giulio explains that Sasha hired Andrea to kill her mother. Arianna sees a woman dressed in black approaching Sasha's apartment. Arianna chases after her to see what she's doing. Giulio sees through his binoculars that the woman is Federica in disguise. She is looking for the key which she left in Sasha's apartment. Giulio realizes Federica was the real killer; Andrea must have joined them later. Giulio calls Arianna on her cell phone, but she refuses to give up the pursuit. Giulio calls the inspector, who arrives at Sasha's apartment before Arianna has a chance to confront Federica. They chase her up to the rooftop. Federica slips off the edge of the building, but the inspector catches her by the arm. The inspector and Arianna haul Federica to safety, and she is placed under arrest. In the final scene, Giulio's cast is off and he gets a phone call from his mother. While they talk he sees another beautiful woman has taken residence in Sasha's former apartment. She is almost naked and reading a book on the couch. She sees Giulio watching, but doesn't seem to mind.

Biography Magali García Ramis was born in 1946 in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico and spent her childhood there with her mother, father and brothers, near her mother's family, with close relations with uncles, cousins and her maternal grandmother. Her father worked as a civil servant in Fort Buchanan; her mother worked in her sister's laboratory for a while and later stayed home with her children. Her eldest aunt, María Luisa Ramis, was the first woman in Puerto Rico to open a laboratory and all her aunts worked there. As a teenager, her family moved to the upscale Miramar section and she and her elder brother had to change schools. She enrolled at the Academia del Perpetuo Socorro (Academy of Our Lady of Perpetual Help), where she graduated from high school. Education and literary contributions In 1964 she enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico where she majored in History. After graduating, she worked for the newspaper El Mundo. In 1968 she received a scholarship and moved to New York City to study journalism at Columbia University. It is in New York that she writes her first story, \\"Todos los domingos\\" (\\"Every Sunday\\"). With this story she won first prize in the literary contest of the Ateneo Puertorriqueño (Puerto Rican Athenaeum). She returned to Puerto Rico in 1971 and started to work for the newspaper El Imparcial. She worked for the newspaper until 1972. She also worked for a literary magazine called Avance until 1973. During this period she continued to write short stories. García Ramis sent a book composed of 4 short stories to a contest sponsored by the Casa de las Américas in Cuba. She received an honorary mention for one of the stories \\"La viuda de Chencho el Loco\\" (\\"The Widow of Chencho, the Mad Man\\") which was published in 1974. That same year she moved to Mexico. She returned to Puerto Rico in 1977 and published another book of short stories called La familia de todos nosotros. She started to work for the School of Communications at the University of Puerto Rico. She routinely collaborated in several Puerto Rican newspapers. She finished her famous semi-autographical novel Felices días, tío Sergio (Happy Days, Uncle Sergio) in 1985; it was published in 1986.Rivas Nina, Myrna. \\"Magali García Ramis: La ciudad como espacio ideal\\" , ciudadseva.com, October 9, 2001; accessed January 15, 2010.

David and Clint Tomkins, a father and son managing the farm, allegedly beat Alan Boland and Bevan Bartman and dragged Boland around the property with a noose around his neck. The incident occurred just four days after the suspicious death in police custody of an Aboriginal man in the community of Palm Island that saw the island community riot. The local Aboriginal community was outraged when the Tomkins were handed down a A$500 fine each for their treatment of the four boys, who themselves were charged with break, enter and steal. The event made headlines in countries around the world, including the UK. The assault On November 2004, four Indigenous boys from the Toomelah Aboriginal Mission swam across the Macintyre River to a nearby Queensland property managed by David Hilary Tomkins (then 44 years old) and his son Clint Williams Tomkins (then 23 years old). The four boys, Alan Boland (16), Bevan \\"BJ\\" Bartman (19), Reg McGrady (23) and Jade, had said that they had previously bought marijuana from the Tomkins but had recently begun stealing it from the property instead. The four boys broke into a building with the intention of stealing from a hydroponic crop inside, but were discovered by the Tomkins. McGrady and Jade escaped to the other side of the river, but the other two, Bartman and Boland, were caught by the Tomkins. Bartman and Boland allege that the Tomkins pulled Boland back through the river, stripped him naked, bound his wrists and then dragged him up an embankment by a rope tied around his neck. They also allege the Tomkins tied Bartman to a tree and forced him to watch as they threatened to cut off Boland's toes with a pair of pliers and beat them both with sticks.Two charged on noose claims Bartman has said he managed to escape after he faked an asthma attack while he was being untied from the tree. He then ran back through the bush and swam across the river. Boland said the two Tomkins then walked into the farmhouse and returned with a double-barrelled shotgun and 0.22-calibre rifle, loaded both in front of Boland and pressed the guns to either side of his temples, yelled racist taunts and hammered the boy's face with their gun butts. The Tomkins called the police and allegedly removed the noose from Boland's neck before they arrived. The police took Boland to Goondiwindi police station and charged him with break and enter. Police behaviour Boland's family have said the police questioned Boland for three hours until legal representation from Legal Aid arrived. The representative allegedly said that Boland was in no condition to give a statement, and ordered the boy be taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries, which he considered were extremely severe. Boland's family have said Boland's face was bruised and swollen, he had suffered several cuts on his body from being dragged around and had rope burns around his neck. Boland's family have said Boland was still in shock and vomited repeatedly on the way to the hospital. At the local Goondiwindi hospital a nurse attended Boland, but the doctor on duty refused to see him, despite the gravity of his injuries, according to Boland's family. At one stage Boland and one of the Tomkins, who had broken his arm in the fracas, were sitting together in the same treatment room. Boland was then taken by the police to a holding cell in Tenterfield. The prosecution The court case was held on 18 May 2005. At 9.30 am, two hours before the case, the police prosecutor told Boland's mother Rosalyn, Toomelah elder Ada Jarrett and a Toowoomba Legal Aid representative that the Tomkins would only get a fine or a good behaviour bond, according to Mrs Boland and Jarrett. According to Jarrett and Mrs Boland, a police sergeant and the prosecutor then repeatedly pressured them for another two hours to sign statements dropping the more serious charge of assault occasioning bodily harm in company, for which there is a maximum penalty of 10 years' jail.Queensland Criminal Code, 1899, Section 339 (3). The sergeant and prosecutor claimed the Tomkins would walk free if Boland didn't arrive at the courthouse on time, said Jarrett and Mrs Boland. The verdict A large number of indigenous relatives and residents from Toomelah, Boggabilla and Moree had turned up to witness the court's proceedings, as had \\"Sugar\\" Ray Robinson, former deputy chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Local Aboriginal leader Bert Button said the charge of assault causing bodily harm in company was an outrage. He demanded the two men be given murder charges. At the hearing, held before magistrate Dennis Beutel, the Tomkins pleaded guilty to common assault. The prosecutor representing the four Toomelah boys did not produce photographs of the boys' injuries nor use their testimonies, according to Jarrett. The prosecutor also failed to mention the drugs on the Tomkins' property. The UK's Daily Telegraph reported that the Tomkins' defence lawyer, Robbie Davis, had said his clients had become fed up with frequent break-ins on the farm and that they had used \\"reasonable force\\" to restrain Boland. Davis said the Tomkins were wrong to tie a noose around Boland's neck. \\"It's a pity they didn't have the hindsight [sic] to put a rope around his waist and not his neck,\\" he told the court. \\"This is not a racial event. It would have been the same if it had been a white youth.\\" The Tomkins were fined A$500 each, and ordered to pay A$300 each to the victim. For a common assault charge, up to three years imprisonment is possible.Queensland Criminal Code, 1899, Section 335. Outside the court house, the victims' relatives were outraged and began yelling abuse at the police and the Tomkins, who were led out under heavy police guard. Protesters waved placards declaring \\"One law for whites and one law for blacks – still\\" and \\"This is KKK land\\". The police had already called in a number of extra squad cars and reinforcements, including a SWAT team that was stationed around the courthouse. ATSIC's Robinson called on Queensland Premier Peter Beattie to investigate the case and the actions of the police. Local leader Bert Button said, \\"The justice system stinks. It's saying it's all right for non-Indigenous people to go and put a rope around someone's neck and drag them up and down a river and give them a flogging.\\" The Tomkins spent the night under police protection. Aftermath There was no appeal brought against the criminal case decision by the victims. After the guilty verdict David Tomkins told the Seven Network that he would do it again if confronted with the same situation. He said it was the third time in two years that his home had been broken into, and that he only wanted to detain Boland, according to an AAP report. \\"My proud home keeps getting broken into and robbed,\\" said Tomkins. \\"All I did was detain one of the criminals for the police.\\" See also *Racism in Australia References Category:History of Queensland Category:2004 in Australia Category:History of Indigenous Australians Category:Crime in Queensland Category:Attacks in 2004 Category:Darling Downs ","title":"Tomkins incident"},{"id":"9457338","text":"Sepia vercoi is a species of cuttlefish native to the southeastern Indian Ocean, specifically the waters off Western Australia ( to ).

It remains largely rooted in the old English common law and equity. Individual provinces have codified many of the principles in a Sale of Goods Act, which was also modelled on early English versions. Quebec, being a civil law jurisdiction, does not have contract law, but rather has its own law of obligations that is codified in the Quebec Civil Code.  Elements of a contract  In following with the common law tradition, a contract requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. The parties themselves must be capable of contracting and must have the intention to create legal relations. =Offer= An offer must be some indication of the offeror to the offeree that he is prepared to form a binding legal agreement. Intention is measured objectively.Grant v. Province of New Brunswick, [1975] 35 D.L.R. (3d) 141 (NBCA) Commercial deals are presumed to be of a legal natureEdwards v. Skyways Ltd., [1964] 1 All E.R. 494 (QBD) while an agreement made between family members or in a social engagement is presumed not to be of a legal nature.See Jones v. Padavatton, [1969] 2 All E.R. 616 (CA) and Balfour v Balfour, [1919] 2 K.B. 571 (CA) An offer must also be distinguished from an invitation to treat, which is where one party invites another party to consider a deal. Advertisements are also considered invitations. Exceptions are made in circumstances where a unilateral contract for performance is offered or where the advertisement is sufficiently serious about its promise such as in the famous Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.. In the similar case of Goldthorpe v. Logan, [1943] 2 DLR 519 (Ont CA) an \\"absolute and unqualified\\" guarantee to safely remove all hair by electrolysis, was found to be an offer as the plaintiff paid for the treatment on the basis of the offer. The display of goods in store is typically an invitation. See Fisher v Bell, [1961] 1 QB 394 and Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd, [1952] 2 QB 795 The quotation of the lowest price is also considered an invitation.Harvey v. Facey [1893] A.C. 552(PC) However, in some circumstances a quotation will be an offer. In Canadian Dyers Association Ltd. v. Burton, [1920] 47 OLR 259 (HC), a quotation followed by the statement \\"if it were anyone else I would ask for more\\" was considered an offer. A call for tenders is usually considered an invitation. In R. v. Ron Engineering & Construction Ltd., [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111, however, the Supreme Court found that a call was an offer where there the call was sufficiently \\"contract-like\\". Later, in M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.,[1999] 1 SCR 619 the Court again found a call to be an offer which was accepted with the tender submission (known as Contract A). In Tercon Contractors Ltd. v British Columbia (Transportation and Highways), the trial judge summarized the factors to be considered in deciding whether a matter constitutes a call for tenders or a non-binding request for proposals:  References  *S.M.

He was known for his fantastic imagery of medieval troubadors and knights in macabre rituals and inspired by the carnival held annually in his native Basel, Switzerland. Life and career Born in Basel in 1900, the son of a furniture department store owner, his parents were not in favor of Seligmann's artistic aspirations but eventually relented. After studying at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Geneva and spending several years working in his father's business in Basel, Seligmann left for Paris where he met with his friends from Geneva, sculptor Alberto Giacometti and art critic Pierre Courthion. During this time, he also met Ivy LangtonInformation about Ivy Langton. Through Giacometti he met Hans Arp and Jean Helion, who admired his sinister bio-morphic paintings and invited him to join their group, Abstraction-Creation Art Non-Figuratif. In the mid-1930s his work began to take on a more baroque aspect, as he animated the prancing figures in his paintings and etchings with festoons of ribbons, drapery, and heraldic paraphernalia. Around 1935, Seligmann met and married Arlette Paraf, granddaughter of the founder of the Wildenstein Gallery. Together they traveled extensively, first around the world during a year-long honey-moon trip in 1936 and then to North America and British Columbia in 1938, to explore American ethnographic art. In 1937, Seligmann was accepted as a member of the Surrealist group in Paris by André Breton, who collected his work and included him in Surrealist exhibitions. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Seligmann arrived in New York for an exhibition of his work at the Karl Nierendorf Gallery. Once there, however, with Surrealist artists being targeted by Nazis, he began to aid those in France and bring them to safety. The correspondence he maintained during this period is preserved in a collection at the Beinicke Rare Book Library at Yale University. Seligmann's art continued to evolve and reached maturity during the 1940s in the United States. Beginning in 1940, he and Arlette lived at the Beaux Arts Building at Fortieth Street in Manhattan, and later they acquired a farm north of the city in the hamlet of Sugar Loaf, New York (in Orange County). Seligmann befriended many American artists as well as the art historian, Meyer Schapiro. With Schapiro as author, in 1944 he produced a limited edition set of six etchings illustrating the Myth of Oedipus. In 1948, a book called The History of Magic was published under his name by Pantheon Books. After the war, his work began to be exhibited widely and acquired by museums throughout the United States and Europe. Seligmann taught at various colleges in New York City, particularly at Brooklyn College, from which he retired in 1958. The changing nature of the New York art world, as it embraced Abstract Expressionism, caused his work to be relegated to art history and perceived as passé. Due to illness, he gave up his Manhattan apartment and retired to his farm, where he died of an accidentally self-inflicted gunshot wound in January 1962. Shortly before his death in 1962, his widow, Arlette Seligmann, bequeathed the entire Seligmann estate to the Orange Country Citizens Foundation, a private nonprofit corporation dedicated to the preservation of Orange County, New York. The foundation now serves as Seligmann's official estate and uses the Seligmann's farm as their office. The U.S. copyright representative for the Orange County Citizen's Foundation and the estate of Kurt Seligmann is the Artists Rights Society.Most frequently requested artists list of the Artists Rights Society At the request of the Orange County Citizens Foundation, artist, Jonathan Talbot, undertook the restoration of the etching press formerly owned by Kurt Seligmann, which is located on the Seligmann property in Sugar Loaf. The project is expected to be completed by August 2011.

Named for its natural bridge of white marble, unique in North America, the park also offers woodland walks with views of a dam made of white marble, and a picturesque old marble quarry. History The bedrock marble from which the natural bridge was created is estimated to be some 550 million years old. Water from glacial runoff began carving the arch after the last Ice Age, 13,000 years ago. The site of a marble quarry from 1810 to 1947 and a privately owned tourist attraction from 1950 to 1983, the site became a state park in 1985. The arch and associated quarry have long attracted attention from hikers, including author Nathaniel Hawthorne who visited in 1838. Hudson Brook The Mohawk Indians that lived, hunted, and fished in the area possibly saw no gain in naming the small brook, but when an explorer for the Massachusetts fort stumbled upon the many caves and rock formations he took it upon himself to aptly name Hudson Brook; forever paying homage to himself.History of the town of Marlborough, Middlesex Co, MA. Charles Hudson, 1862 T.R. Marver and Sons. Boston, MA pg 399 Lieutenant Seth Hudson was stationed at Fort Massachusetts in 1759 and discovered what is today known as Hudson Brook around 1760 when he relocated out to the Western Massachusetts/Vermont border. Hudson was later one of the founders of the southern Vermont town of Pownal. Hudson Brook is responsible for many of the marble formations that can be seen at the Natural Bridge. The brook cascades down a marble maze and eventually makes its way through a cave known as Hudson Cave. This natural wonder was one of several locations in the Berkshires noted in the journal of Nathaniel Hawthorne which was eventually published under the title The American Note-books.  The mills  The Natural Bridge site is rich in a multitude of minerals, including calcite, muscovite, feldspar, pyrite, and quartz---but it is mostly known for its rich deposits of marble rock. This quarry brought great wealth to the community. North Adams saw a boom in its economy and culture for well over one hundred years because of the mill located there, while marble cutting brought a wealth of aesthetic greatness. Stone cutting in North Adams started at first in an inexperienced, coarse manner. Amateur workers cut marble for gravestones, stone facings, underpinnings, and mantle pieces for the wealthier class in town. The earliest stone cutting was unorganized and generally unregulated until around 1810. In 1810, Solomon Sherman who was a man of “high reputation” commenced his business at the natural bridge site. His operation was based on home trade. Operations were continued and taken over by his heir, Manson Sherman. It was in 1830 that Elijah Pike decided to start his own operation, opening up a shop on Eagle Street. In 1830, Elijah Pike opened up his shop on the main strip of town. As the quality and quantity of the marble became known, a wider market opened up and Pike saw a chance to commence his operation with capital from one Dr. E.S. Hawkes. The men pooled their resources in improving the grounds, laying out a road, and putting up the mills. All of this was at a cost of 1,800 dollars. In 1837, Mr. Blackinton, a local man, bought in with Mr. Pike and the operation continued until it was sold to W.M. McAuley for 7,000 dollars in 1838. From this point on, it was owned by a joint stock company and the annual product (marble, lime, etc.) was estimated at 56,000, which was quite a nice amount of cash. Preservation efforts started early when in 1835 two gentleman known as Messrs. Dwight and Denny bought the marble ledge for 150 dollars for the purposes of preserving the area. Five acres of surrounding land was purchased by one John Page for 217 dollars, whom entered into a perpetual lease from the town, who then owned thirty acres of land.

He is featured in the books Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, and their corresponding film adaptations, and the novel Midnight Sun—a re-telling of the events of Twilight from Edward's perspective. Edward is a telepathic vampire who, over the course of the series, falls in love with, marries, and fathers a child with Bella Swan, a human teenager who later chooses to become a vampire as well. In the Twilight film series, Edward is played by actor Robert Pattinson. Concept and creation Stephenie Meyer stated that the original concept of Edward originated in a dream that she had, in which an \\"average girl\\" and a \\"fantastically beautiful, sparkly ... vampire ... were having an intense conversation in a meadow in the woods.\\" In this dream, the pair \\"were discussing the difficulties inherent in the facts that ... they were falling in love with each other while ... the vampire was particularly attracted to the scent of her blood, and was having a difficult time restraining himself from killing her.\\" She chose the name \\"Edward\\" because she thought it was \\"a name that had once been considered romantic, but had fallen out of popularity for decades\\". Meyer says that Edward is a combination of her three favorite leading men - Jane Eyres Edward Rochester, Fitzwilliam Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, and Gilbert Blythe from Anne of Green Gables—particularly Edward Rochester, who, like Edward Cullen, sees himself as a \\"monster\\". A recurring theme in the series, especially in the first three books, is that Edward is constantly trying to avoid accidentally harming Bella, due to his vampire nature. Appearances =Twilight= In Twilight, Edward meets Bella Swan, a 17-year old outcast whose thoughts he is unable to read, and whose blood smells overwhelmingly sweet to him. Edward builds a growing attraction to Bella, but after saving her life on several occasions, he succumbs and eventually falls in love with her. Edward admits to Bella that he is a vampire, and that although he retains the physical body of a seventeen-year- old, he was actually born on June 20, 1901. His adoptive father, Carlisle Cullen, transformed him into a vampire in 1918 to prevent him from dying in the Spanish influenza epidemic in Chicago, Illinois by the request of Edward's mother, who begged him to do whatever it took to save him. Carlisle instilled in him a sense of morality uncommon in most vampires, and central to his way of life is the refusal to consider humans as food. However, Edward constantly warns Bella against being with him, perceiving her life to be at risk if she continues to associate with him. Bella's love and confidence in Edward's restraint cause her to ignore his warnings, even after she becomes the vampire James' target. Unlike the Cullen family, who are \\"vegetarian\\" vampires (committed to only feeding on animals), James regularly feeds on humans and will not stop until he drinks Bella's blood. With his family's help, Edward is able to save Bella from James' predations, but how to assure Bella's continued safety remains an open question. =New Moon= In New Moon, Edward's fears for Bella's safety intensify when she cuts her finger and is attacked by his brother Jasper. In an attempt to protect her, he convinces her that he no longer loves her, and moves away with his family, leaving Bella heartbroken and depressed for several months. Edward finds it difficult to live without Bella, and becomes severely depressed at the prospect of an infinitely long and meaningless life. After he mistakenly learns from his sister Rosalie that Bella has committed suicide, Edward attempts to convince a group of Italian vampires, the Volturi, to kill him. Together with his sister Alice, Bella rushes to Italy and stops Edward before the Volturi can destroy him. Edward explains why he left and apologizes to Bella. She eventually forgives him entirely, and they continue with their relationship as though Edward had never left, with the exception that Bella has ties that cannot be broken with a werewolf named Jacob Black. Bella successfully seeks the support of Edward's family on turning her into a vampire. While Edward is furious at the prospect, he later agrees to change her himself if she agrees to marry him first. =Eclipse= In Eclipse, Bella agrees to marry Edward on the condition he will make love to her while she is still human. Edward eventually relents and agrees, on the stipulation it will only occur after they are married. The plot is driven by the machinations of the vampire Victoria, who, seeking revenge for the death of her mate James, is hunting Bella and creating new vampires to build an army. A grudging truce is made between the Cullens and the Native- American werewolf pack led by Sam Uley and Jacob Black, a friend of Bella's who was there for her when Edward broke her heart. However, the truce is endangered when Bella realizes Jacob means more to her than she thought. Ultimately, Edward accepts that Bella cares for Jacob and successfully destroys Victoria, and Bella acknowledges that Edward is the most important person in her life. Edward tells Bella that they may attempt making love before they get married, as he realizes that she spends too much of her life trying to please other people. However, she refuses his offer and agrees to doing things the way Edward initially wanted: marriage, making love, and then becoming a vampire. =Breaking Dawn= Breaking Dawn sees Edward and Bella marry. Bella becomes pregnant on their honeymoon, and the rapid growth of the half-human, half-vampire fetus swiftly impacts on Bella’s health. Edward tries to coerce her into having an abortion in order to save her own life. However, Bella feels a bond with her unborn child and insists on giving birth. Edward comes to feel love for the baby as well, after he hears its thoughts and learns that the baby loves Bella in return. Bella nearly dies giving birth in an emergency c-section, but Edward successfully delivers his daughter and then injects Bella's heart with his venom, healing her wounds by turning her into an immortal vampire. During Bella's painful transformation, Jacob imprints on their baby daughter, Renesmee. After a vampire named Irina mistakes Renesmee for an immortal vampire child—a creation forbidden in the vampire world—the Volturi arrive to destroy the Cullens. Edward stands with Bella and their allies to convince the Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child and poses no threat to their existence. Once the Volturi leave, Edward and Bella feel free to live their lives in peace with their daughter. Characterization Edward is described in the book as being charming, polite, determined, and very stubborn. He is very protective over Bella and puts her safety, humanity and welfare before anything else. He often over- analyzes situations and has a tendency to overreact, especially in situations where Bella's safety is at risk. He retains some outdated speech from his human life in the early 20th century. Edward sees himself as a monster, and after falling in love with Bella, he desperately wishes that he were human instead of a vampire. =Physical appearance= Like all the vampires in the Twilight series, Edward is described as being impossibly beautiful. At various points in the series, Bella compares him to the mythical Greek god Adonis. His skin is \\"like marble\\"—very pale, rock hard, ice cold, and sparkles in the sunlight. She describes his facial features as being perfect and angular—high cheekbones, strong jawline, a straight nose, and full lips. His hair, which is always messy, retains the unusual bronze shade that he inherited in his human life from his biological mother. His eyes, once green, are now described as topaz. His appearance changes if he goes too long without feeding: his eyes darken, becoming almost black, and purple bruises appear beneath his eyes. Edward is 6'2\\", and has a slender but muscular body. =Vampiric abilities and personal interests= Edward, like all vampires in the Twilight series, possesses superhuman stamina, senses, mentality, and agility, as well as a healing factor and night vision. His superhuman strength allows him to subdue his prey, uproot trees, throw cars, and crush metal. His bodily tissue is stronger than granite, making him much more durable and tougher than humans as well as contributing slightly to his body weight. He is described as being inhumanly beautiful with refined and perfected features. His scent and voice are enormously seductive to Bella, so much so that he occasionally sends her into a pliant daze entirely by accident. In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not need to breathe, though he chooses to do so out of habit and because it is helpful to smell his environment. He cannot digest regular food, and compares its attractiveness for him to the prospect of eating dirt for a regular person. Like other vampires, Edward is not able to sleep. In addition to the traits he shares with his fellow vampires, Edward has certain abilities that are his alone. He possesses superior superhuman speed compared to that of other vampires and is the fastest of the Cullens, able to outrun any of them. Edward is also telepathic, able to read the mind of anyone within a few miles of himself; Bella is the sole exception to this rule, which Meyer has stated is due to Bella having a very private mind. Edward also retains some of the traditional mindset and dated patterns of speech from his early-20th century human life. Edward is musical, able to play the piano like a virtuoso. He enjoys a wide range of music, including classical, jazz, progressive metal, alternative rock, and punk rock, but dislikes country. He prefers indie rock to mainstream, and appreciates rock and classical music equally. He mentions in Twilight that he likes music from the fifties better than the sixties, dislikes the seventies, and says the eighties were \\"bearable\\". A hobby of Edward's is collecting cars. He owns a Volvo S60 R and an Aston Martin V12 Vanquish as a \\"special occasion\\" car. He also gave his sister Alice a Porsche 911 Turbo as a gift in Eclipse. He bought a motorcycle to ride alongside Bella, but gave it to Jasper after he realized that riding motorcycles was a hobby she enjoyed sharing with Jacob. Film portrayal =Casting= Prior to the role of Edward being cast for the 2008 Twilight film, Meyer opined that, although Edward was \\"Indisputably the most difficult character to cast, [he] is also the one that I'm most passionately decided upon. The only actor I've ever seen who I think could come close to pulling off Edward Cullen is....(drumroll)....Henry Cavill.\\" When the film was optioned by Summit Entertainment in July 2007, Meyer stated that; \\"The most disappointing thing for me is losing my perfect Edward\\", as Cavill was by then 24 years old, and thus too old to realistically fill the role. Meyer reported on her website that the four most popular fan suggestions for actors to play Edward were Hayden Christensen, Robert Pattinson, Orlando Bloom and Gerard Way. On December 11, 2007, it was announced that Pattinson, known for his portrayal of Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter films, had been cast in the role. Erik Feig, Summit Entertainment’s President of Production, stated: \\"It is always a challenge to find the right actor for a part that has lived so vividly in the imaginations of readers but we took the responsibility seriously and are confident, with Rob Pattinson, that we have found the perfect Edward for our Bella in Twilight.\\" Meyer stated that; \\"I am ecstatic with Summit's choice for Edward. There are very few actors who can look both dangerous and beautiful at the same time, and even fewer who I can picture in my head as Edward. Robert Pattinson is going to be amazing.\\" Twilight director, Catherine Hardwicke, said of the casting process that \\"[e]verybody has such an idealized vision of Edward. They were rabid [about who I was going to cast]. Like, old ladies saying, 'You better get it right.\\" She revealed that she was initially underwhelmed by a photo of Pattinson, but said of his audition, which was a love scene with co-star Kristen Stewart: \\"It was electric. The room shorted out, the sky opened up, and I was like, 'This is going to be good.'\\" Pattinson has admitted; \\"I had no idea how to play the part when I went in, and it was a good thing to find during the audition. I really wanted it after that, but I didn’t really even know what it was. I hadn’t really read any of the books. And just from that, ‘I want this job.’ It was pretty much because of Kristen.\\" In early 2008, Pattinson spoke of a fan backlash against his casting, disclosing Entertainment Weekly that \\"I stopped reading [fansites and blogs] after I saw the signatures saying 'Please, anyone else.'\\" He revealed to the Evening Standard that; \\"The books have a huge following, and I’ve already got bags of letters from angry fans, telling me that I can’t possibly play Edward, because I’m Diggory. I hope I can prove them wrong.\\" =Development= Following an April 2008 set visit, Meyer opined that Pattinson and Stewart had developed chemistry so good it \\"may cause hyperventilation\\". Pattinson revealed that Meyer had given him an early copy of Midnight Sun—a re-telling of the events of Twilight, narrated from Edward's point of view. He explained that: \\"That is what I liked about [taking on] the job, because the guy doesn’t really exist that much, so you can just create whatever you want. Then, when I found out there was another book from Edward’s perspective, [I read it and it turned out] we had the same perspective!\\" In preparation for the role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and distanced from his friends and family, explaining that he \\"wanted to feel his isolation\\". Physically, he revealed that; \\"I was supposed to get a six-pack. But it didn't really work out.\\" One scene in the story sees Edward, a gifted pianist, compose a lullaby for Bella. Pattinson was given the opportunity to submit a composition for consideration for this scene, with Hardwicke stating; \\"I told him he should write one, and let’s see if we can make it work, because that would be really cool if it was Rob’s song. He’s a beautiful musician, a very creative soul, very similar to Edward. He just totally reads the most interesting stuff, and sees the most interesting movies, and is very introspective and diving into his existential self.\\" Meyer approved; \\"If Robert could write a lullaby, that would definitely add to some of the mystique of the movie, wouldn’t it?\\" While two of Pattinson's compositions do feature in the final film, the lullaby piece finally selected was composed by Carter Burwell. In April 2008, Hardwicke, in a turnabout from her initial underwhelmed reaction upon first seeing a photograph of Pattinson, enthused; \\"The thing that’s great about him is he really does [...] feel like he’s otherworldly. I mean, he doesn’t look like a normal guy. And when you read the book, you think, ‘Who on the planet can live up to this description?’ But I think he does. He’s just got that chiseled face that photographs exactly like it’s described in the book. When you read about the sculptured cheeks and chiseled jawbone and everything, it’s like, ‘Wow. Did she write this for Rob?\\" Pattinson, in a detailed interview on how he perceives the character, admitted to having incorporated aspects of Rebel Without a Cause into his portrayal of Edward, assessing; \\"I guess kind of the thing which I found interesting is that he is essentially the hero of this story but violently denies that he is the hero. Like at every point even when he does heroic things he still thinks that he’s [...] the most ridiculously selfish evil creature around. [..] He refuses to accept Bella’s love for him but at the same time can’t help but just kind of needs it, which is kind of what the essential storyline is.\\" Appearing at ComicCon in July 2008 while the film was in post-production, Pattinson surmised the Twilight experience as: \\"bizarre. You kind of know that it is essentially the book. The book has so many obsessive, obsessively loyal fans. It's strange because people just immediately relate you to the character right away rather than you as an actor.\\" Pattinson reprised his role as Edward in all of the Twilight sequels. In an interview, Pattinson admits that he never had formal training on how to do his American accent; \\"...I just grew up watching American movies... I kind of learned how to act, or whatever, from American films. Reception Larry Carroll for MTV Movies deemed Edward and Bella \\"an iconic love story for a whole generation\\", while Kirkus cited Edward's portrayal in Twilight as being \\"overly Byronic\\". Edward Cullen was also ranked #5 on the Forbes list of Hollywood's 10 Most Powerful Vampires. Entertainment Weekly named him \\"one of the greatest characters of the last 20 years\\" and described him as a \\"literary influence and love of girls and women everywhere for a long time to come\\". Since the release of the Twilight series, the character of Edward has developed somewhat of a cult following, with millions of devoted, mostly female, fans worldwide. However, while the character has been called the \\"obsession of teen girls\\", several criticisms of his character, in particular accusations of sexism, have emerged. Gina R. Dalfonzo of the National Review Online described Edward's character as mentally unstable and a \\"predator\\", using behavioral examples such as spying on Bella while she sleeps, eavesdropping on her conversations, dictating her choice of friends, and encouraging her to deceive her father as reasons why Dalfonzo believes he is \\"one of modern fiction's best candidates for a restraining order.\\" References External links * Stephenie Meyer official website * Twilight series official website * Twilight movie official website * Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional attempted suicides Category:Fictional characters from Chicago Category:Fictional characters from Washington (state) Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Fictional telepaths Category:Fictional vampires Category:Literary characters introduced in 2005 Category:Male characters in film Category:Male characters in literature Category:Orphan characters in literature Category:Twilight series characters he:דמדומים (רומן)#דמויות pl:Zmierzch (cykl)#Bohaterowie powieści ","title":"Edward Cullen"},{"id":"9457471","text":"Mourtala Diakité (born 1 October 1980, in Bamako) is a Malian former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder.

It is notable as an early development in Irish theatre. The play was written and performed during Shirley's stay in Dublin in the years 1637-40\\\\. Shirley, one of the most prominent and successful London playwrights of the previous decade, moved to Dublin during the long closure of the London theatres, from May 1636 to October 1637, due to an epidemic of bubonic plague. St. Patrick for Ireland was clearly written specifically for Shirley's new Dublin audience; it was performed in the autumn of 1639, at the Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin, \\"the first Irish playhouse.\\"Logan and Smith, p. 159. There is no record of a London performance in Shirley's era...or later. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 28 April 1640 and was issued later that year in an octavo volume, printed by J. Raworth for the bookseller Robert Whitaker. In both the Prologue and Epilogue to the 1640 printed text, Shirley promises to continue the story of St. Patrick in a second part to the play -- which apparently was never written. Because of this, however, the existing play is sometimes referred to as Part 1, or 1 St. Patrick for Ireland. The play was reissued in 1657 in London, in a quarto that it shared with Shirley's The Constant Maid. The play was next reprinted in Dublin in 1751, when William Rufus Chetwood included it in A Select Collection of Old Plays. The play's genre has been described as \\"neo-miracle,\\" an updated version of the miracle or mystery play that typified Medieval theatre. Shirley applied his knowledge of the stage devices of the London stage to tell a story rich in Christian miracle lore. (One critic has speculated that the proposed second part of the play would have dealt with \\"St. Patrick's Purgatory,\\" an Irish place of pilgrimage.)George Philip Krapp, cited in Nason, p. 435. Shirley's primary source for historical data on his subject was the biography of the saint by Abbot Jocelyn of Furness (c. 1185). The play's apparent pro-British-imperial political implications provoked a response, in Landgartha, a drama composed by the Dublin lawyer Henry Burnell and staged on 17 March 1640. One of the dedicatory verses to that play criticizes dramatists who employ \\"flames and fire / Tempests and whirlwinds\\" to tell their stories -- a reference to the effects in Shirley's play.Ohlmeyer, p. 120-1. Synopsis At the start of the play, the Irish Druids are up in arms, and soldiers are manning all the ports, in response to a prophecy of St. Patrick's arrival and his coming success in converting Ireland to Christianity. The King, Leogarius, has been having nightmare visions of the coming campaign against him. But of course, St. Patrick's arrival is not the military-style campaign that the King fears; the saint comes with a group of priests -- and his guardian angel, Victor. Leogarius tries to poison Patrick, but fails; a servant drinks the poison and dies, but is brought back to life by Patrick (a miracle that converts Leogarius's queen). In another instance, two men disguise themselves as the statues of Jupiter and Mars in a pagan temple (Shirley conflates the Druids with Roman mythology), and when the King is present the statues move and speak and demand the blood of Patrick. After the ceremony is done, the masqueraders descend from their pedestals, and as a reward are allowed to \\"dance\\" with the Queen's daughters. In the final confrontation, the Druid Archimagus summons up poisonous snakes to kill the sleeping Patrick; but the saint providentially wakes in time and dispels the snakes from the entire island. The Archimagus is swallowed by the earth. The King converts to Christianity as a result -- though Patrick mistrusts the firmness of his change of heart (a reservation that leaves an opening for a continuation of the story). Forsythe notes significant parallels in structure and characterization with the Dekker/Massinger play The Virgin Martyr, among other works of the era.Forsythe, pp. 223-31.

(now Bukidnon Governor) Jose Maria Zubiri, Jr., from 1995–1998, he ran for the seat representing the third district of Bukidnon to be vacated by his father in the 1998 general elections. Winning easily in that election, he served his first term in the 10th Congress. During his first term, he was one of the members of what the media dubbed as the \\"Spice Boys\\", a group of neophyte and two-term congressmen who were openly critical of President Joseph Estrada's administration. He was subsequently re-elected to the Philippine House of Representatives in the 2001 and 2004 elections. =Senate= After serving as a congressman for three terms, he was drafted by Lakas CMD to be one of their candidates in the pro- Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration TEAM Unity ticket for the 2007 mid-term elections. In the final tally for the 2007 senatorial race by the Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec), Rep. Zubiri narrowly defeated opposition candidate Koko Pimentel for the 12th and last slot in the Senate. Zubiri had a total of 11,001,730 votes against Pimentel's 10,983,358 votes. The margin of some 18,372 votes was strongly contested, particularly the votes from the southern Philippine province of Maguindanao, where Pimentel had lost to Zubiri by a landslide. Claiming that the votes in Maguindanao were tainted, Pimentel petitioned the Philippine Supreme Court to invalidate the votes from Maguindanao, effectively disenfranchising a whole province. The Supreme Court voted unanimously 14 -0 against Pimentel and allowed the COMELEC (Commission on Elections) to count the votes in Zubiri's favor. Pimentel then returned to the Supreme Court for a second time. This time, he petitioned the justices to issue a restraining order against the proclamation of Zubiri.

In the 14th Congress of the Philippine Senate, he became Senate Majority Leader, replacing Senator Francis Pangilinan on November 17, 2008. During his Majority Leadership, the Senate passed a record 650 bills.

In his speech, he said that his family was hurt by the \\"unfounded\\" accusations against him. \\"Without admitting any fault and with my vehement denial of the alleged electoral fraud hurled against me, I am submitting my resignation as a duly elected Senator of the Republic of the Philippines in the election for which I am falsely accused without mercy and compassion,\\" Zubiri said in his speech. \\"My political detractors began calling me ugly names and dragging the name of my family in entirety. In other words, Mr. President, the trial by publicity has begun,\\" he continued. His resignation was lauded by Malacañang and various sectors, but was also seen as a step that helped restore the Filipino's faith in national electoral protests. Senator Francis Pangilinan, a member of the Senate Electoral Tribunal, likewise refused to comment on what the next procedure is for the vacancy left by Zubiri. \\"Let's just wait for developments if any,\\" he said.Senator Zubiri resigns from post, to run in 2013 – Yahoo!.

It was directed by Bob Rafelson and written by Carole Eastman, who together had been responsible for 1970's Five Easy Pieces. The film is the fifth collaboration between Nicholson and Rafelson. Beverly D'Angelo and Harry Dean Stanton co-star. Plot Harry Bliss (Nicholson) runs a guard dog service and is going through counseling with his wife, Adele (Lauren Tom). A serial killer is on the loose in Los Angeles, so when the apartment of classical singer Joan Spruance (Barkin) is ransacked and she starts receiving threatening phone messages, Joan moves into the Hollywood Hills home of her sister, Andy (D'Angelo). Joan does not feel safe there, either, because she is harassed by Andy's ex-lovers. She hires a guard dog from Harry's company, and Harry is soon providing more than protection for the beautiful singer. Harry is a natural-born liar who, because of his profession, feels that he lives by a code of honor – even if he cannot quite explain it – as one thing after another spins out of his control. Joan is soft and vulnerable as she is badgered by her conductor husband, harassed by unknown callers, menaced by men from her sister's past, and \\"helped\\" by Harry.

It currently holds a 7% \\"Rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"C\\" on scale of A+ to F. The New York Times review said \\"Not much about \\"Man Trouble,\\" a sad mess of a romantic comedy directed by Bob Rafelson, written by Carole Eastman and starring Jack Nicholson, suggests that these three collaborated on one of the most haunting and representative films of another day.\\" Variety's review said that \\"Jack Nicholson fans should feel cheated by Man Trouble, an insultingly trivial star vehicle. After some initial business attracted by his name on the marquee, film is fated for pay- cable use.\\" Film Four's review stated: \\"Sold on the proven teamwork of director Rafelson and actor Nicholson -- who had previously worked together on Five Easy Pieces, The King of Marvin Gardens and The Postman Always Rings Twice -- this romantic comedy proved to be one of their least inspired collaborations. Nicholson plays a grouchy dog-trainer who slowly loosens up in the presence of romantically challenged opera singer Barkin, who needs to get some canine security after a series of death threats. Obviously intended to be a bright and breezy romantic-comedy thriller, it ends up a mangy old mutt of a movie thanks to a charmless script and disastrous casting decisions.\\" According to Time Out magazine: \\"The trouble is, the film never seems to know where it's headed. Not quite a romance, a thriller or a comedy, it's a movie with an on-going identity crisis. Barkin, playing against type, produces a shrill caricature of femininity, while Rafelson indulges Nicholson's familiar soft-spoken laxity, another of his personable rogues.\\" Jack Nicholson earned a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor for his performances in both this film and Hoffa, but lost the trophy to Sylvester Stallone for Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. =Box office= The film opened in 1,004 theatres and grossed $2,034,475 in its opening weekend. It grossed 67% less the following weekend and was pulled from theatres shortly thereafter with a gross of only $4 million. With a budget of $30 million, including almost $8 million paid to Nicholson, the film made a loss for Pentamerica, their second consecutive box- office bomb after Folks!.

OR 501 is known as the Alsea-Deadwood Highway No. 201 (see Oregon highways and routes). It is long and runs north-south, entirely within Benton County. OR 501 was established in 2002 as part of Oregon's project to assign route numbers to highways that previously were not assigned. In 2009, ODOT posted route shield signs at both termini and another intersection. Route description OR 501 begins at the intersection of OR 34 in the small rural town of Alsea, from there, it heads south through mostly forested, rural land, following the route of the original logging roads making it extremely curvy at its southern end where it abruptly ends and turns into county maintained Lobster Valley Road. History The Alsea-Deadwood Highway was originally planned to start in the small logging town of Alsea, travel south through Lobster Valley, continuing to the small community of Paris and south to end at OR 36 in Deadwood. The Highway was never completed south to Paris from Lobster Valley and it was later decided by the Oregon Highway Commission to abandoned any future plans to complete the Highway as originally planned. OR 501 had been built with the intention to continue south to connect OR 34 from Alsea to OR 36 in Deadwood, hence the name \\"Alsea-Deadwood Highway\\". However, only 16 miles were completed on the north end from OR 34 to Preacher Creek Road with approximately 13 miles on the south end from OR 36 leaving an area in the middle unfinished. (Approximately 6 of the original 16 miles of the north side were turned over to Benton County, while the approximate 13 mile section running North from OR 36 was turned over to Lane County, leaving the current 9.49 miles from the small community of Alsea as the only section of OR 501 still maintained by ODOT) There was a covered bridge built on the Lane County section of the Highway, which was bypassed when it was straightened and turned over to Lane County in the 1960's. This covered bridge is on the list of historic covered bridges within the state. ODOT has attempted to turn the Highway over to Benton County for several years, however the Highway is in such poor condition with several locations on active slide areas, Benton County has not been interested in taking over control of the Highway without ODOT bringing it up to meet current Highway standards which would cost several millions of dollars. The potential of having a major slide on the Highway is high due to the fact almost half of the Highway is built on steep unstable ground. Because of the low traffic volume on the Highway, ODOT has never attempted to straighten, widen or upgrade it, they have also never completely resurfaced it causing it to fall somewhat in disrepair over the years. According to ODOT statistics and sources, OR 501 is in the poorest condition of any other Oregon highway throughout the entire state. In 2019, ODOT designated this section of OR 501 as part of the Scenic Byway that goes to Alsea Falls.

The petroglyph site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Chariton the Confessor was a 4th-century CE Christian saint from Asia Minor. White settlement along the river began in the early 1820s as pioneers ventured up the valley from Howard County, Missouri. With a few notable exceptions the interaction with the native Sac-Fox and Iowa tribes was peaceful. The tribes primarily used northern Missouri areas along the river as hunting grounds and not for permanent residence. A misunderstanding between settlers and Chief Big Neck and a party of Iowa hunters in July, 1829 led to a conflict known as the Big Neck War. The Sac-Fox had ceded all hunting rights to northern Missouri in 1825, but Big Neck and his band of Iowa refused to acknowledge the transaction.

As had the Native Americans before them, early settlers found an area rich with game for hunting, ample fish in the river, and large stands of timber. =Later years= Very large catfish caught in the Chariton River near Novinger, Missouri. Until flood control channelization catfish of this size were not uncommon. Below the Highway 136 bridge at Livonia, Missouri, the river has been channelized and dredged. The largest amount of this happened in 1948 and 1949 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. According to the Missouri Department of Conservation, \\"public use of Chariton River watershed streams is very low, largely because instream habitat has been so adversely affected by channelization and sedimentation\\".Chariton River Watershed: Opportunities for Stream Fishery Conservation Major tributaries are Mussel Fork Creek and Shoal Creek. Because of extensive channeling the Little Chariton River, formerly a tributary, now flows directly into the Missouri about from the main branch. A branch of the Little Chariton was dammed in Macon County, Missouri to create Long Branch Reservoir.

The virus is a non-enveloped, flexuous rod-shaped particle that is between 760-800 nm long and 12 nm in diameter. It is transmitted between plants by mechanical activities like pruning and by numerous aphid species such as Myzus persicae. No seed transmission has been detected. There are two major types of this virus that are serologically indistinguishable and are so closely genetically related that they are now considered the same virus species. The type that gave the virus its name are the Type P isolates (PRSV-P). This type infects papaya and several members of the melon family (Cucurbitaceae). The other type, Type W isolates (PRSV-W), does not infect papaya. Isolates of PRSV-W do infect cucurbits such as watermelon, cucumber, and squash and were originally known as Watermelon mosaic virus 1. History Hawaiian papaya production has been severely affected twice by PRSV. The virus was introduced to Oahu as early as 1937.Parris, G.K. (1938) A new disease of papaya in Hawaii. Proc. Am. Soc. Hortic. Sci. 36, 263–265. The disease was mild for a number of years until it either mutated or a more aggressive strain was introduced around 1950. Within 12 years, the amount of land under papaya production dropped 94%. Production was then moved from Oahu to the Puna region of Hawaii island (the \\"Big Island\\") under strict quarantine. In 1971 PRSV was found in home gardens but efforts were taken to prevent its spread. The virus emerged in commercial farms in 1992 and by 1995 production in Puna was impossible. Commercial growers again relocated to the Hamakua coast but with only limited success. Hawaiian papaya production was halved by the end of the decade. Transgenic papaya varieties that are resistant to PRSV entered production in 1998 and resuscitated the industry. Distribution and origin Both pathotypes are distributed worldwide. PRSV-P, for example, is known to be present in the Middle East, Africa, South and Central American. It has also been found in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Taiwan, and the United States. PRSV-W isolates have been found in the United States, the Caribbean, Mexico, Italy, Germany, Australia, France, India, the Middle East, and South America. Using genetic phylogeny studies, researchers suspect the virus originated in Asia, likely India, about 2,250 years ago. From there it slowly spread through the continent reaching China about 600 years ago. It was also introduced directly from India to Australia and the Americas within the last 300 years. Papayas were introduced to India only 500 years ago, at which point the virus made the jump from cucurbits. However, the virus has switched back and forth between pathotypes many times in its evolution. PRSV-P Symptoms are typical of viral diseases. Papaya exhibits yellowing, leaf distortion, and severe mosaic. Oily or water-soaked spots and streaks appear on the trunk and petioles. The fruit will exhibit bumps and the classic \\"ringspot\\". A severe isolate of PRSV has also been shown to cause tissue necrosis. Cucurbit symptoms tend to be similar to papaya symptoms including blisters, mosaic, yellowing, and leaf distortions. This virus produces two types of inclusion bodies visible under a light microscope with proper staining of epidermal strips. One inclusion is the typical cylindrical inclusion (CI) which is considered diagnostic for the potyvirus group, and the other is called the amorphous inclusion (AI). The presence of both inclusions can be diagnostic for this virus. PRSV-W In squash, watermelon and other cucurbits, PRSV-W causes mottling and distortion of leaves and fruit. PRSV-W is considered to be one of the limiting factors in the growing of cucurbits in Florida. PRSV-W should not be confused with Watermelon mosaic virus 2, another potyvirus that infects cucurbits around the world, including Florida, and which is now known simply as Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV). PRSV has a different host range, different serological properties, and no nucleotide sequence homology with WMV. WMV also has different cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that can differentiate it from PRSV-W. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been made for both of the CI and AI proteins as well as for the capsid protein of PRSV-W. Vectors Aphids are the predominant means by which PRSV is transmitted. PRSV is a non-persistent virus, meaning it does not enter beyond the feeding mouthparts of the aphid, and does not circulate or multiply within its insect host. Non-persistent viruses are transmitted quickly and easily between plants. Many species of aphid can transmit PRSV, particularly the Peach Aphid and Melon Aphid. Seed transmission has been observed at rates of 2 infected second generation plants out of 1355.Bayot, R. G., Villegas, V. N., Magdalita, P. M., Jovellana, M. D., Espino, T. M., & Exconde, S. B. (1990). Seed transmissibility of papaya ringspot virus. Philippine Journal of Crop Science, 15(2), 107–111. This method of transmission is marginal compared to transmission through aphid vectors. However, if infected seed survives, it could then function as a source on inoculum, which then could be spread by insect vectors. Disease transmission can also occur by planting infected seedlings in fields where the virus is not present. Using \\"clean\\", virus-free seedlings for planting is of very high importance. Control There is a known resistance to PRSV, although certain varieties are more symptomatic than others. There are four main methods of control for PRSV: quarantine and geographic displacement, roguing and netting, cross-protection, and genetic modification of the host plant. Because PRSV is a non-persistent virus and is consequently transmitted to healthy plants by aphids within a very short time period, insecticidal control is difficult and impractical. Once symptoms have been observed, it is already too late to spray for aphids – the disease has most likely already been transmitted to nearby healthy plants. In order to implement successful vector control, frequent preventative sprays are required, which is rarely done. Prevention through quarantine and geographic displacement of cropland is common and has occurred in Hawaii, the Philippines and Brazil. When fields become infected, such as the case of Oahu papaya growers, attempts to relocate growing areas to virus- free fields are made. This is usually just a temporary avoidance of the disease, which eventually spreads to the new fields. Roguing, or the removal and destruction of infected plants, is a way to control the spread of PRSV. This method was employed unsuccessfully when PRSV began to invade the Puna region of Hawaii. It is difficult to suppress the spread of PRSV through roguing because it is spread very quickly and effectively by aphids. Netting can also be used to prevent insect vectors from spreading the virus. Production under netting is prohibitively expensive for subsistence and small- scale producers, but was used effectively in Taiwan because geographical displacement was not possible on such a small island. =Cross protection= Cross protection is similar in practice, although not in mode of action, to viral vaccinations in humans. A mild strain of PRSV is introduced into the host plant, which then develops resistance to virulent strains of the virus. Development of cross-protection in papaya was researched in Hawaii starting in 1979. A delay in the onset of symptoms was achieved, as well as a reduction in the severity of symptoms. However, inoculation of the mild strain also caused pathogenesis on the papaya plants. =Transgenics= There are two transgenic varieties of papaya, both of which were created by Dennis Gonsalves and his team and were introduced for production on May 1, 1998. Rainbow (created by Dennis Gonsalves) is an F1 hybrid, which is a cross between the yellow fleshed Kapoho and the red-fleshed SunUp. Rainbow is produced on 76% of Hawaiian papaya acreage, while SunUp is hardly grown commercially. SunUp is thought to be more resistant to exotic strains of PRSV, while Rainbow has shown susceptibility to such exotic strains of the virus. Transgenic varieties have been shown to be extremely effective against Hawaiian strains of PRSV, showing complete resistance to the virus compared to 100% infection of susceptible strains in some trials. Pathogen-derived resistance (PDR) is the technique of inserting a gene fragment from the pathogen into the transgenic crop, which then affords the crop plant resistance against the pathogen. This method was employed in the development of transgenic papaya. PRSV's coat protein gene was inserted into highly embryogenic plant tissue by using the newly invented gene gun, which led to the development of the transgenic line 55–1, which was proven to be effective at controlling Hawaiian strains of PRSV. =Deregulation= The evaluation of whether or not to release transgenic papaya in the United States was undertaken by APHIS, the EPA and the FDA. This incident was unique in that transgenic crops are usually developed and promoted by commercial operations, while transgenic papaya and the case for deregulation was adopted by University of Hawaii researchers. The university was highly motivated to help save the Hawaiian papaya industry, and consequently took a leading role in pushing for commercialization of the fruit. Japan is 20% of Hawaii's export market. Japan had been resistant to approve GMO papaya since its introduction in 1998. As of 2011, the Rainbow transgenic papaya has been approved for export to Japan. =Durability of resistance= So far in Hawaii, there has been no breakdown of the coat protein resistance encoded in transgenic strains of papaya. Exposure to foreign strains of the virus is a serious risk, as Rainbow papayas have been shown to be susceptible to PRSV from Guam, Taiwan and Thailand. Economic impact In Hawaii, PRSV has had dramatic effects. Between 1992 and 1997, nearly all fields in the Puna region had been affected. This is a local industry worth $11 million annually. Papaya is grown for personal consumption by small subsistence farmers in parts of Southeast Asia, with small surpluses sold at market. PRSV is the biggest constraint to papaya production in the Philippines. In 1994, PRSV damage had destroyed 60 million pesos worth of papaya production in the Southern Tagalog area, and had reduced production levels by 80%. Brazil accounts for nearly half of global output, with India second and Nigeria third in worldwide production. Dramatic geographical shifts of production to avoid PRSV have been common. For example, between 1973 and 1984, papaya production moved substantially in Brazil away from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo to the northern states of Espirito Santo and Bahia. As with the case of Hawaii, PRSV generally catches up to the industry's movements over time. The total economic costs of such redistributive costs are unknown, but likely significant. Backlash against GMO papaya has resulted in surreptitious destruction of papaya plantations under the cover of darkness. In some cases, farmers have lost up to $15,000 worth of papaya trees.

In Canada, Indigenous Law refers to the legal traditions, customs, and practices of Indigenous peoples and groups. Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain Constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices. Aboriginal is a term used in the Constitution of Canada and includes First Nations, Inuit and Métis people. Canadian Aboriginal Law enforces and interprets certain treaties between the government and Indigenous people, and manages much of their interaction. A major area of Aboriginal law involves the duty to consult and accommodate.  Sources of law  Aboriginal law is based on a variety of written and unwritten legal sources. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 is the foundation document creating special land rights for Indigenous peoples within Canada (which was called \\"Quebec\\" in 1763). Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the federal parliament exclusive power to legislate in matters related to \\"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\\". Under this power, that legislative body has enacted the Indian Act, First Nations Land Management Act, Indian Oil and Gas Act, and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Act. Part II of the Constitution Act, 1982, recognizes Aboriginal treaty and land rights, with section 35 being particularly important. Section 35's recognition of Aboriginal rights refers to an ancient source of Aboriginal rights in custom.

Both teams were recruited by Rick Jones from young amateur radio enthusiasts in order to obtain and divulge strategic information about safety hazards, most notably those involving the Hulk. The first group was founded in The Incredible Hulk #6 (March 1963). Overview The rationale for creating such teams was that with their help Rick Jones could reach the Hulk (and occasionally other people or events of interest) faster, possibly in time to help him avoid fights or other incidents that could bring the Hulk trouble. The first Teen Brigade was formed by Rick in The Incredible Hulk #6 (March 1963), and they helped build a weapon for the Hulk to defeat the Metal Master. The group played a role in the origin of the Avengers in The Avengers #1, because it was the tampering of a radio transmission the Brigade intended to send to the Fantastic Four that brought the original Avengers (Thor, Iron Man, Wasp and Ant-Man) together to fight the Hulk. In The Avengers #2 (November 1963), they called Giant-Man (Hank Pym) to help defeat a Space Phantom. They contacted the Avengers to notify them about the whereabouts of the rampaging Hulk in The Avengers #3 (January 1964). In The Avengers #4 (March 1964), the team helped Rick and Captain America track down a villain who turned the Avengers into stone. Captain America showed off his acrobatics abilities to the Teen Brigade in The Avengers #5 (May 1964). They later freed the Avengers when they had been imprisoned inside Kang's ship by pretending they wanted to join Kang, then dropping an energy cylinder to distract the time-traveller. The second Teen Brigade was assembled at a time when the Hulk was under the Corruptor's control. In an eerie parallel to the Avengers' origin, the Corruptor's own equipment interfered with a transmission meant to the Avengers and instead reached a handful of south western superheroes, giving birth to the superteam known as the Rangers. The Teen Brigade was mentioned as an inspiration by Captain America when he decided to create an online network in stories published in the early 1990s. A third version of the Teen Brigade appear in the 2011 series Vengeance composed of Barnell Bohusk, Angel Salvadore, the In-Betweener and two new heroes: Miss America (America Chavez) and the Ultimate Nullifier. In other media Teen Brigade appear in Hulk segment of Marvel Super Heroes Show (1966).

In 1410, local soltys, Piotr of Jedlicze, fought in the Battle of Grunwald. Until the mid-16th century, Jedlicze belonged to the noble families of Mleczko and Baczalski. In 1657, the village was ransacked by Transilvanian soldiers (see Swedish invasion of Poland) In the late 17th century, Jedlicze belonged to the Wielowiejski family, which unsuccessfully tried to grant town charter to the village. Finally, Jedlicze became a town in 1768, during the reign of King Stanisław August Poniatowski. On April 5, 1770, a Polish–Russian battle took place near Jedlicze, during the Bar Confederation. Following the first partition of Poland (1772), Jedlicze was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained in Austrian Galicia until 1918. In 1884, the village, as Austrian authorities stripped it of the town charter, received rail connection with Stróże and Zagórz, and in 1899–1902, a large oil refinery was built here. The village remained in private hands until the 1920s, its last owner was Walerian Stawiarski. During World War II, local Jewish population was decimated in The Holocaust. On February 25, 1942, the Gestapo arrested a number of Polish underground movement activists, who gathered at the Stawiarski Palace. In 1944, 22 men were shot as a reprisal for killing a police officer. Jedlicze had a Home Army post; its local unit in April 1943 attacked a Ukrainian pro- Nazi training school. Jedlicze regained its town charter in 1967. Among interesting places, it has a neo-Gothic church (1925), the Stawiarski Palace with a park, neo-Gothic cemetery chapel (1864). Two daughters of Maria Konopnicka are buried here – Laura Pytlinska (died 1935) and Zofia Mickiewiczowa (died 1956).

History Robert Falcon Scott's Terra Nova Expedition (1910-1913) comprised several groups. One of these, the Northern Party, led by Victor Campbell, did not accompany Scott into the interior but wintered at Cape Adare. In 1912, that group (composed of six men in total), began the long journey homewards and began making their way to Cape Evans (via Hut Point). However, they were dropped at Evans Coves with sledging provisions for six weeks with the intention of completing geological work. After the work was done they were left with rations for about four weeks, as it was not anticipated the ship would have trouble picking them up later in February. But the Terra Nova could not reach them due to heavy pack ice.Apsley Cherry- Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World, Carrol & Graf, 1922. Unable to connect with their ship, the Northern Party was forced to winter in Antarctica again. In March 1912 the party excavated a small ice cave in a snow drift they nicknamed \\"Inexpressible Island\\" where they spent the winter in miserable conditions, supplementing their rations by killing scarce seal and penguins for meat. Seaweed on Inexpressible Island. The Northern Party had previously built a supply depot at Hells Gate Moraine (74° 52'S, 163° 50'E) on Inexpressible Island as a form of security should the Terra Nova be unable to collect them. The depot primarily consisted of a sledge loaded with supplies and equipment. Despite the fact that this depot had been built, the winter spent in the ice cave and a partially constructed rock shelter on Inexpressible Island was miserable.

She was born in Rockville, Connecticut in 1978.Mary Mattingly ICP Page She has studied at Parsons School of Design in New York, and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) from Pacific Northwest College of Art in Portland, Oregon in 2002. She is the recipient of a Yale University School of Art Fellowship, and was a resident at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center from 2011-2012. Work Mattingly explores the themes of home, travel, cartography, and humans' relationships with each other, with the environment, with machines, and with corporate and political entities. She has been recognized for creating photographs and sculptures depicting and representing futuristic and obscure landscapes, for making wearable sculpture, \\"wearable homes,\\" and for her ecological installations, including the Waterpod (2009). =Wearable Home (2004–06)= In this expansive series of photographs, Mattingly portrays scenes from a post-apocalyptic world where nomadic individuals survive with the help of wearable technology. Mattingly envisions a future where technology has \\"made people separate, even afraid of others\\". The wearable homes are meant to convey notions of home and sustainability, but also to address specific survival issues like finding water and temperature regulation. While the images resemble science fiction scenes, Mattingly designs the suits for actual treks through the wilderness and was even commissioned to design a survival kit for the disaster-relief company Black Umbrella. =Opera (2006)= In December 2006, she released a multimedia opera at White Box in New York titled Fore Cast.Mary Mattingly Fore Cast an Opera Fore Cast was positioned as an environmental disaster opera and featured an art installation with music and performances depicting World War IV which was predicted by Albert Einstein: > \\"I don't know what World War III will be fought with, but I know World War > IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\\" The gallery was filled with water, sand, and tree stumps with a circular projection that covered the space. =Waterpod (2009)= The Waterpod barge in New York City From June through September 2009, Mattingly led a NY-based multinational team of artists, designers, builders, civic activists, scientists, environmentalists, and marine engineers to launch the Waterpod, a free, participatory New York Citywide event docking in all 5 boroughs and at Governors Island. Designed as a new habitat for the global warming epoch, the Waterpod represented a sustainable, sculptural art and technology habitat, with as many as four artists living on and off it, generating food, water, and power in a contained and self-sufficient environment.New York Times: A Fluid Definition of Self-Sufficiency While focusing on collaborative artistic projects, the resident artists emphasized the repurposing and transformation of all forms of materials. The Waterpod included space for: (i) community and artistic activities; (ii) eco-initiatives including food grown with collected rainwater, and gray water recycling, with energy provided from environmental and human sources; and (iii) an artists’ residence. A critical intent of the Waterpod was to showcase the importance of water and the natural world, while serving as a model of an autonomous living system.Flavorwire: Don't Rock the Boat on The Waterpod Project Mattingly says she was inspired to create Waterpod in 2006 because at the time she felt that NYC was not doing enough to bring attention to rising water levels. Over the life of the project a rotating cast of artist joined the crew of the Waterpod. A number of them were interviewed about the project, and reported that life on the boat forced a shift in focus onto everything it takes to keep a fragile, man-made ecosystem running. =Flock House (2012)= Flock House premiered in May 2012 at The Clocktower Gallery in NYC, and is an extension of previous projects to do with water, nomadic structures, and sustainability such as her Waterpod project from 2009. The project featured a series of four portable, self-sufficient ecosystems built with reclaimed materials and installed at temporary sites across the five boroughs of New York City. The structures are meant to be demonstrate the possibilities of small scale systems and run off a combination of passive and human-powered energy, and include human-scale gardens and systems for collecting water from rain run-off. Following the May 2012 premier, the migratory structures traveled the New York City park system between June and August 2012, appearing in places such as Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Battery Park, and the Snug Harbor. During each installation of the work, and different person lived within the structure for the duration, sometimes for as long as two weeks at a time. Participating people include Christopher Robbins from Ghana ThinkTank, Greg Lindquist, and Amelia Marzac. The Flock Houses also traveled to Bronx Museum, the Maiden Lane Exhibition Space, and Omi Sculpture Park in Ghent, NY. After the initial run in NYC, Flock House travelled to other cities, including a commission for the Bemis Center in Oklahoma from March–September 2014. Additionally, it was the focal point of an exhibition at College of Fine Arts School of Visual Arts at Boston University’s 808 Gallery. Mary Mattingly’s Flock House Project: Omaha, a citywide workshop and exhibition curated by Amanda McDonald Crowley, was developed while she was a resident at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art, in Omaha, Nebraska. Inspired by patterns of global human migration and pilgrimage, the Flock House Project is a group of mobile, sculptural, public habitats and self-contained ecosystems that are movable, modular, and scalable. It debuted in Omaha on March 13, 2014, the exhibition included selected works from her Island, Anatomy of Melancholy, Second Nature, Nomadographies, House and Universe; and Wearable Portable Architecture works, and her works for her Tools series made at the Bemis Center. The centerpiece for the exhibition was one of the three portable structures. =smArt Power Project, Manilla, Philippines (2012)= In 2012 she was a part of the smARTpower project, \\"Wearable/Portable Architecture project\\", and worked with Green Papaya Art Space in Manila, the Philippines, initiated by the US Department of State and the Bronx Museum. The project discussed the possibilities of having a locale create portable architecture based on the conditions of its environmental, urban and cultural conditions. It was organized to find ways in providing new arguments and sustaining an artistic impetus to our immediate environment. It addresses the timely issues of flooding and mobility, engaging participants to come up with designs that would respond to current environmental disasters and if portable architecture is applicable in our urban landscape. =WetLand (2014)= From August 15- Sept 17, 2014 on the Delaware River, WetLand was a mobile, sculptural habitat and public space constructed to explore resource interdependency and climate change in urban centers. A floating sculpture, it resembles a partially submerged building, integrating nature with urban space. Narrating a watery urban ecotopia, the interior contains a living space, work space, and performance space, it combines art, architecture, and ecology. WetLand’s overall ecosystem includes rainwater collection and purification, greywater filtration, dry compost systems, outdoor vegetable gardens, indoor hydroponic gardens, and railing gardens circling the perimeter. =Swale (2015–ongoing)= Swale is a floating food forest situated on a 130-foot by 140-foot barge that docks in harbors around NYC. It is part art installation, part community engagement project, and was launched during July 2016 after a year of planning and building in collaboration with numerous community groups. After receiving initial seed funding from A Blade of Grass as part of a fellowship, Mary Mattingly and her team, including curator Amanda McDonald Crowley, launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise additional funds and awareness during May 2016 where they raised $32,523 from 333 people. The inspiration for Swale came after Mattingly learned that is generally illegal to grow food on public land. The food gardens on Swale include vegetables like broccoli and kale and also fruits like tomatoes and plums, and can be harvested for free distribution via community partners. During summer 2016, Swale docked in the Bronx at Concrete Plant Park, Brooklyn Bridge Park and Governors Island.

It was created in response to Diet Rite Cola. Fitness promoter Debbie Drake was Patio Diet Cola's spokesperson; the drink was also marketed as a soda alternative for diabetics. In 1964, Patio released orange, grape, and root beer flavors. This flavor line was not meant to compete with brands like Orange Crush, but rather fill out the line. Patio sodas were available in the cold-bottle market: grocery and mom-and-pop stores. Advertising for Patio was comparatively scarce; at the time, bottlers were regionally franchised, and related advertising was necessarily local. In 1964, Patio Diet Cola became Diet Pepsi. The newly branded diet soda was advertised alongside Pepsi, with the tagline \\"Pepsi either way\\", which replaced the slogan \\"Dances with flavor\\".

In effect, Tocqueville was referring to the general nature of American society during the 19th century. It appeared to him, at least on the surface, that every citizen in the United States had the opportunity to participate in the civic activities of the country. Another way to look at mutual liberty is by accounting for the collective free wills of every rational being in a community. Even though the notion of mutual liberty was introduced by Tocqueville, it was John Stuart Mill who greatly expanded it.John Stuart Mill, On Liberty and Utilitarianism (New York: Bantam Books, 1993), 12–16. Mill believed that the most proper occasion for mutual liberty was in a community governed by the consent of the governed, i.e., a republic. And according to Mill, it is only in a republic where members of all political factions can participate. It has been said that a republic is the form of government that divides people least.James McMillan, Modern France: 1880–2002 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 11. This statement pertains greatly to mutual liberty. Unlike positive and negative liberty, mutual liberty encompasses all citizens. It makes no distinction between political preference and social status. Mutual liberty pervades all sectors of society, from the homeless man on the street to the premier of the state. It is the process through which a general sense of morality gets exerted on the widest range of people in any given communal setting.

He graduated from Kudan High School in Tokyo and received a degree in French literature from Rikkyo University. He currently lives in Zushi, Kanagawa. He first worked on translations of French chanson songs, but while on honeymoon he made the acquaintance of Yujiro Ishihara and became a Japanese popular song (kayōkyoku) writer. He is one of the main lyricists in the world of post-World War II kayōkyoku. He gave the world an extensive collection of works--songs such as \\"Kyou de owakare\\" and \\"Kita sakaba\\" which became big hits, but also a large proportion of unusual songs. In 1969, his total sales exceeded 10 million records. He has displayed talent in many fields, including concert and stage production, movie performance, singing, composing, translation, novel and essay writing, and cultural broadcasting (as a personality on \\"Sei! Yangu!\\" and as a regular on NHK's \\"N-kyō\\"). However, behind his showy life, he suffered from difficulties such as heart disease, divorce, and having to repay his elder brother's extensive debts. From those personal experiences came novels such as Kyōdai and Sakura no densetsu. He is a pacifist and desires reconciliation with China and Korea, and this shows in his writing style and speech. He gave up lyric writing at the end of the Shōwa era and concentrated on opera production and performance and novel and essay writing. Kyōdai was nominated in 1998 for the 119th Naoki Prize.

The first theme is presented as a series of eighth note-tuplets in cut time, but not in time, played at a very fast tempo of Allegro. The second theme is in B minor's parallel major, B major, and in triple metre. The second theme is repeated four times, and develops into a variation of the first theme, returning to cut time and B minor. Copious pedal point notes and phrase markings are present in the second theme, but the entire étude lacks any pedal indications. Similar to the Op. 10, No. 4 étude, Chopin emphasizes legato playing through the phrasing and (lack of) pedal marking.

Early life Nassos (Athanassios) Vakalis was born and raised in Athens, Greece. Since childhood, he demonstrated an interest in art, submitting his early work in various contests and winning numerous prizes and distinctions. Education During adolescence Nassos’ interest turned toward character animation. He got his start working as a cartoon and graphics artist for several advertising agencies and small studios in Athens and later pursued his studies in art and animation in the United States. Nassos attended the Department of Film and Video at Pratt Institute, New York and acquired his B.F.A. in Fine Arts, majoring in Character Animation from California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California. During his senior year at college, Nassos participated in the Short Film Festival of Drama Greece where he premiered his animated debut film Don’t Feed the Bear. This film attracted the attention of legendary animation director Don Bluth, who offered Nassos a permanent position with his company. Professional career In Sullivan-Bluth Studios, Nassos began as an animation assistant but scant weeks later he was promoted to an animator. In that position he completed the production of the films Rock-a-Doodle, A Troll in Central Park and Thumbelina, developing his talent and skills under real production conditions and requirements. Soon after he became Supervising Animator \\"The Great Animal and Crocodiles\\", \\"Footmen\\" for the film The Swan Princess for Rich Entertainment and simultaneously worked freelance on many advertising spots, shorts and other feature films.

Comprising vocalist Bill \\"Choptop\\" Moseley, guitarist Buckethead, drummer Pinchface and keyboardist Travis Dickerson, the band released five albums, two DVDs, and three compilation albums before they split up in 2007. The songs were heavily inspired by 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)' and its sequel 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)', with Bill Moseley getting into his Choptop character from the latter. Biography The band released their first album, Spot the Psycho, in 1999. The band didn't release anything else until 2001, when they released their second album, Cemetery Pinch, and third album, How Now Brown Cow, simultaneously. All three albums were self-released and sold via Moseley's website. In 2004 the Cornbugs released their fourth album called Brain Circus. This album was released on the label of their new keyboardist Travis Dickerson, TDRS Music. Later that same year they released their fifth and final studio album of new material called Donkey Town. In 2005 and 2006, TDRS Music compiled most of Cornbugs' early self-released material and remastered it, releasing it on the albums Rest Home for Robots, Skeleton Farm and Celebrity Psychos. The band announced their split in 2007 after two DVDs, Quackers! and Headcheese were made available. The band contributed three songs on the tattoo instructional DVD, \\"Dead Man's Ruin - Advanced Tattoo Techniques\\" by Derek Dufresne, a very sought-after tattoo artist from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

The separate California Air Resources Board is responsible for regulating mobile sources (e.g. vehicles) in the air basin. Basin geography The South Coast AQMD includes all of Orange County; and the non-desert regions of Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, and Riverside County including the Coachella Valley. The South Coast Air Basin area encompassed by the South Coast AQMD amounts to about 10,750 square miles (27,850 square kilometres) and is the second most populated area in the United States. This area has a severe problem with smog, and the South Coast AQMD has been a leader in the nation's efforts to reduce air pollution emissions. The main office is located in the city of Diamond Bar. Operations South Coast AQMD develops, adopts and implements an Air Quality Management Plan for bringing the area into compliance with the clean air standards established by national and state governmental legislation. Air quality and permissible air pollutant emission \\"rules\\" are promulgated to reduce emissions from various sources, including specific types of equipment, industrial processes, paints, solvents and certain consumer products. Permits are issued to the pertinent industries and businesses to enforce compliance with the air quality and emission rules, and South Coast AQMD staff conducts periodic inspections to ensure such compliance. South Coast AQMD's rules apply to businesses ranging from large oil refineries and power plants to gasoline (petrol) fueling stations and dry cleaning plants. There are about 30,000 such businesses operating under South Coast AQMD permits. In general, the agency is limited to establishing rules for regulating stationary sources. Emission standards for mobile sources (automobiles, trucks, buses, railroads, airplanes and marine vessels) are established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board. =Air quality monitoring network= South Coast AQMD also operates an extensive network of air quality monitoring stations (about 40 stations) and issues daily air quality forecasts.

Each publication day, 18,000 copies of the paper are distributed by bulk drops at more than 300 locations. Home delivery is available for a fee. The paper also publishes a free online edition. The newspaper draws many of its readers from Laconia, but also covers Alton (and Alton Bay), Belmont, Center Harbor, Gilford, Gilmanton, Meredith, Sanbornton and Tilton (including Winnisquam), all in Belknap County.The Laconia Daily Sun Advertising Ratecard , January 1, 2006. Accessed February 11, 2007. Lakes Region News Club, Inc., which owns The Laconia Daily Sun, is a partnership between President Edward J. Engler, Publisher Adam Hirshan and Mark Guerringue, publisher of The Conway Daily Sun. The Laconia Daily Sun was founded June 5, 2000, with Engler as publisher and John Hourihan as editor. The initial press run was 2,000 copies, and the paper was in direct competition with The (Laconia) Citizen, a paid circulation daily newspaper founded in 1926 and owned at the time by the Robert Foster family of Dover, New Hampshire. The two daily newspapers were head-to-head competitors for more than 16 years, until The (Laconia) Citizen ceased publication on Oct. 1, 2016. Engler assumed the position of editor in 2002 and held it until November, 2015 when he retired and was succeeded by Ginger Kozlowski, formerly editor of The (Laconia) Citizen, (Engler was elected mayor of Laconia in 2013 and again in 2015.) Hirshan and Guerringue were not involved in the day-to-day operations of the newspaper in the early years, but Hirshan took over responsibility for the advertising department in 2006 and added oversight of the front office when he began working full-time in Laconia in 2007. He assumed the publisher's role in 2012. The newspaper was initially printed by The Conway Daily Sun but began printing with the Dow Jones-owned Seacoast Media Group in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 2008 and with the Concord Monitor in 2014. The move to Seacoast Media Group also marked the beginning of a revolutionary \\"all color all the time\\" policy whereby display advertising rates were revised to reflect the fact that all display ads in the newspaper would thereafter be printed in full color.  Sisters and competitors  Unlike the original Daily Sun newspapers, The Laconia Daily Sun went head-to-head with an established, paid- subscription daily newspaper on its home turf: The Citizen, based in Laconia (The Citizen ceased publication in October 2016). The first two News Club dailies are the only daily newspapers in their counties: The Conway Daily Sun in Carroll County, and The Berlin Daily Sun in Coos County, New Hampshire. In 2009, News Club founded a fourth free daily, The Portland Daily Sun, in Maine's largest city, which was closed in November 2014, when it acquired the alternative weekly The Portland Phoenix. The Conway Daily Sun also publishes a monthly tourist magazine called North Conway with a distribution of 15,000.

The school was founded in 1991 when Sunset, Leonville, and Arnaudville High Schools were consolidated to form one centralized high school. The school serves the communities of Arnaudville, Cankton, Grand Coteau, Leonville, and Sunset. It is located at 7076 Highway 93, Arnaudville, Louisiana. Beau Chene High School has been cited for demonstrating inclusion among all their students. Beau Chêne is accredited by the State of Louisiana's Department of Education. History Beau Chene High School, Arnaudville, Louisiana Beau Chêne High School is the result of consolidating the public schools in St. Landry Parish. Consolidation in St. Landry Parish began as a result of a federal lawsuit filed in 1965. The lawsuit is entitled Monteilh, et al. v. St. Landry Parish School Board, et al., No. Civ. 10912, (W.D. La. March 9, 1965). The plaintiffs in Monteilh, et al. v. St. Landry Parish School Board, et al., alleged that on or about September 7, 1964, their application for admission to Palmetto High School, Palmetto, Louisiana, were denied because of their race. Monteilh, et al. v. St. Landry Parish School Board, et al. lasted fifty-one years. U.S. District Judge Rebecca Doherty dismissed the fifty-one year old case on August 30, 2016. The previous federal judge assigned Monteilh, U.S. District Judge Tucker L. Melancon, in Graham v. Evangeline Parish School Board, was cautioned in an unpublished opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \\"to limit itself to traditional judicial decision making rather than school administration, and to refrain from day-to-day management of its decrees.\\" The court also expressed their concern in regard to Judge Melancon being personally involved in the case and wrote his actions were more administrative than judicial. The court wrote one could perceive from the record that Judge Melancon had taken over the independent decision making of the school board. The court was unable to rule on the Graham appeal since the appeal was not a final decision from the district court. Thus, they lacked appellate jurisdiction. Graham v. Evangeline Parish School Board, Case No. 04-30356, pp. 12-14 (5th Cir. May 17, 2005). In 1986, the St. Landry Parish School Board approved a plan to build three new high schools as part of a plan to consolidate all the high schools in St. Landry Parish. A group of citizens returned to federal court and filed briefs in Monteilh, et al. v. St. Landry Parish School Board, et al., opposing the school board plan to consolidate and build three new schools. The case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In their briefs, Monteilh alleged the new high schools the school board planned to build would have created a quasi-racially segregated school system. Monteilh requested school construction be enjoined pending preparation of a new consolidation plan. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled the St. Landry Parish School Board met their constitutional obligations in designing its own plan and the court denied Monteilh's request. Beau Chêne High School was conceived in the early-1980s when the St. Landry Parish School Board began consolidating the parish's small rural high schools to form three large centrally-located high schools. The plan was later approved and implemented, forcing Arnaudville High School, Leonville High School, and Sunset High School to close and merge with each other. In 1989, construction on Beau Chêne began on property in the unincorporated community of Prairie Basse. At the front of the property were—and still are—several large oak trees which inspired the name \\"Beau Chêne.\\" The name of the school was originally Southeastern High School, keeping with the geographical naming style the St. Landry Parish School Board used to name the other two consolidated high schools (Northwest High School and North Central High School). Someone (reportedly Lanny Moreau, former St. Landry Parish Superintendent, who at the time was Arnaudville High School's principal) suggested that the school be named \\"Beau Chêne,\\" which is French for \\"beautiful oak.\\" The St. Landry Parish School Board approved naming the school Beau Chene High School as the name for the Southeast Consolidated High School on Thursday, May 17, 1990. Classes commenced at Beau Chêne on August 19, 1991. The official dedication of Beau Chene High School was on Friday, September 6, 1991. Academics Beau Chêne High School offers a wide variety of courses for its students. In keeping with its missions to \\"provide the individual with rich and varied experiences appropriate to meet his present and future needs\\" and to \\"develop in the student an appreciation of literature, art, music and the beauty of nature,\\" Beau Chêne offers classes in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, art, music, Spanish language arts, French language arts, agricultural science, business, family and consumer science, and computer science.

In humans, it is encoded by the DNMT1 gene. DNMT1 forms part of the family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which consists primarily of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B.  Function  This enzyme is responsible for maintenance DNA methylation which ensures the fidelity of replication of inherited epigenetic patterns. It has a very distinguishable preference of methylating CpGs on hemimethylated DNA. Aberrant methylation patterns are associated with certain human tumors and developmental abnormalities.  See also  * DNA methyltransferase  Interactions  DNMT1 has been shown to interact with UHRF1,: * DMAP1, * DNMT3A * DNMT3B, * HDAC2, * PCNA, * RB1. and * G9A DNMT1 is highly transcribed during the S phase of the cell cycle when it is required for methylation of the newly generated hemimethylated sites on daughter DNA strands. Its interaction with PCNA and UHRF1 has been implicated in localizing it to the replication fork. The direct co-operation between DNMT1 and G9a coordinates DNA and H3K9 methylation during cell division. This chromatin methylation is necessary for stable repression of gene expression during mammalian development.  Model organisms  Knockout experiments have shown that this enzyme is responsible for the bulk of methylation in mouse cells, and it is essential for embryonic development. It has also been shown that a lack of both maternal and zygotic Dnmt1 results in complete demethylation of imprinted genes in blastocysts.  Clinical significance  DNMT1 plays a critical role in Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. HSCs with reduced DNMT1 fail to self-renew efficiently post-transplantation. It has also been shown to be critical for other stem cell types such as Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and Mammary stem cells (MaSCs). Conditional deletion of DNMT1 results in overall intestinal hypomethylation, crypt expansion and altered differentiation timing of ISCs, and proliferation and maintenance of MaSCs.

It appears from Bava Batra 10b that Nehunya was a contemporary, but not a pupil, of Johanan ben Zakai. He was the teacher of Ishmael ben Elisha. Nehunya was rich and had a large retinue of servants; but he was distinguished for his meekness and forgiving nature, to which he attributed his attainment of great age;Megillah 28a two short prayers composed by him exhibit the same qualitiesBerakhot 4:2; Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:2. According to Rabbi Yochanan,Shevu'ot 26a Nehunya interpreted the entire Torah by the hermeneutic rule known as the \\"general and particular\\" (\\"kelal ufrat\\"), a rule which his pupil Rabbi Ishmael made the eighth of his 13 hermeneutic rules. Nehunya is frequently mentioned in the Talmud; in Hullin 129b he is referred to disagreeing with Eliezer and Joshua in regard to a halakhah.compare, however, Eduyot 6:2 He said that the Pharaoh of the Exodus was rescued from the Red Sea, that he repented, that he afterward reigned in Nineveh, and that it was he who in the time of Jonah exhorted the inhabitants of Nineveh to repentance.Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer 43 Nehunya is known also for his ethical saying: \\"Whoever accepts upon him the yoke of the Torah, from him is removed the yoke of royalty and that of worldly care; and whoever throws off the yoke of the Torah, upon him is laid the yoke of royalty and that of worldly care\\".Pirkei Avot 3:6; Avot of Rabbi Natan recension B, 32 [ed. Solomon Schechter, p. 68] As Rabbi Ishmael, Nehunya's disciple, is regarded by the kabbalists as their chief representative, Nehunya is considered to have been Ishmael's teacher in mysticism also. He is generally supposed to have been the author of the daily prayer beginning אנא בכח, the initials of which form the forty-two-lettered name of God. He is also supposed by some to have been the author of the Bahir, Sefer haTemunah and of the Sefer ha-Peli'ah.  References  *  Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography  * W. Bacher, Ag. Tan. i. 54-56; * Z.

Early Life and Education Gordon was born on May 6, 1918 in Spray, North Carolina to the Reverend William Jones Gordon and Anna Barrow Clark. He studied at the University of North Carolina and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1940. He attended Virginia Theological Seminary and earned a Bachelor of Divinity in 1943. Career He was ordained deacon on January 24, 1943. Invited to Alaska by Bishop John B. Bentley in 1943, he served five years as missionary-in-charge on the Arctic Coast, mostly in Point Hope, Alaska. He was ordained priest by Bishop Bentley on July 25, 1943 in St Mark's Church in Nenana, Alaska. Gordon was consecrated bishop of Alaska on 18 May 1948 in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Raleigh, North Carolina by 13 bishops of the Episcopal Church of the USA - among them was his predecessor, Bishop Bentley, Bishop Edwin A.

Morehouse Pub Co, New York, NY. . Before earning his pilot's license in 1949, Gordon had traveled about 6,000 miles by dogsled to minister to villages along Alaska's Arctic Sea coast. After returning to the state as a bishop but before earning his wings, Gordon visited all of the churches in his diocese on a three-month, 3,500-mile trip by boat. After earning his wings, Gordon logged over 1 million miles on a small plane purchased by the church for him to visit his flock. He retired in 1974 and later served as assistant bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan. Gordon died in Midland, Michigan, in 1994.

It breeds in Australia. The species is closely related to (and sometimes considered conspecific with) the Kentish plover, Javan plover and white-fronted plover. Description Red-capped plovers have white underparts and forehead. Their upperpart are mainly grey-brown. Adult males have a rufous or reddish-brown crown and hindneck. Adult females have a paler rufous and grey-brown crown and hindneck, with a pale loreal stripe. The upperwing of Charadrius ruficapillus shows dark brown remiges (flight feathers) and primary covert feathers with a white wingbar in flight. Its length is 14–16 cm and its wingspan is 27–34 cm; and weighs 35–40 g. Breeding plumage shows a red-brown crown and nape with black margins. Non-breeding plumage is duller and lacks the black margins. Distribution and habitat Manly Marina, SE Queensland, Australia The red-capped plover is widespread in Australia; it is a vagrant to New Zealand, although it bred there for some time in small numbers from 1950–1980. The species occupies a range of coastal and inland habitats, including estuaries, bays, beaches, sandflats and mudflats; inland saline wetlands. It is also found in inland wetland areas with bare ground. Food \\"Nest\\" with eggs Mainly small invertebrates, especially molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Breeding Female A chick, adopting a camouflaged position that helps it avoid detection by predators such as gulls and crows. The red-capped plover is a seasonal breeder on the coasts of Australia, but breeds in response to unpredictable rains inland. The plover nests on the ground close to wetlands; the nest is a small depression in the ground, with minimal or no lining. The clutch of two pale yellowish- brown eggs are speckled with black spots. Incubation period 30 days; incubating is mainly done by the female. Upon hatching, the young are open- eyed, mobile and relatively mature (precocial); and flee the nest (nidifugous). Conservation With a large range and no evidence of significant population decline, this species' conservation status is of Least Concern. References *BirdLife International. (2006).

It is common in lowland forests and maturing second growth. Little information is known about the bird. It feeds on grasshoppers, cicadas, crickets and beetles.  Description  Like all frogmouths, the Philippine frogmouth has large eyes to allow better night vision, a large flat bill they use to capture insects, and cryptic plumage that allows them to be camouflaged while perched during the day. They are the only frogmouth found in the Philippines; the only species they could be confused with is the Philippine Nightjar, which has a similar shape, but very different plumage. The Philippine frogmouth is a medium frogmouth, 24–26 cm long, with two color morphs (and intermediate phases); one is a chestnut rufous with deep rufous ground color, the other a lighter brown with buff and black barring. Both morphs have 3 distinct light buff or white bands; one on their hindneck, a second on their lower throat, and a third around the lower breast. They have a yellow-orange iris and brown feet and bill. Males and females are similar, though females are typically darker and plainer than males.  Distribution and Habitat  The Philippine frogmouth is a sedentary bird, endemic to the Philippines, and is widely distributed within the archipelago, though noticeably absent from Palawan. Though rare, there have been sightings in India and Australia. They are thought to be found in lowland and maturing (but not mature) second growth forests, but their habitat is not known in detail as they are only active at night and do not sing songs or have loud calls. Behavior and Ecology = Reproduction = The nest is built from a horizontal branch that is placed two to five meters above ground. It is made from the parent's own downy feathers which is held in place using spider silk, moss and lichens. The female lays one egg per season. The male incubates the egg during the day and the female at night. = Diet and Feeding = Philippine frogmouths are adaptable, and eat large insects, such as grasshoppers, cicadas, crickets, and beetles. They feed by waiting on low branches and striking when they notice an insect moving below. Like other species in the genus Batrachostomus, the Philippine frogmouth has elongated bristles around the base of their bill, believed to protect their eyes from prey. = Vocalizations = Male calls are a series of low, deep woah, wash, Guam, or g-aw noises, or a short even trill. Female calls are louder, a short mewl that descends in pitch. Both sexes have a harsh growling call they repeat several times per minute, and a harsh staccato-like scream that is believed to be an alarm call.  Conservation  The Philippine frogmouth is currently listed as species of least concern by the IUCN as of 2012, though it is believed its population is slowly declining due to habitat destruction. The reason for this listing is the large range, the rate of decline not reaching the threshold to qualify as a vulnerable species, and while the population size has not been officially quantified, it is believed to exceed the threshold to be considered vulnerable based on the population size criterion.

It is the second of five Gil Hamilton detective stories. It was published in 1973 in the Roger Elwood anthology Ten Tomorrows. Science fiction philosopher Stephen R. L. Clark, in his work How to Live Forever (1995), mistakenly credits this story with inventing the term \\"corpsicle\\". The term had already appeared in Frederik Pohl's The Age of the Pussyfoot (1969), after an earlier spelling by Pohl was published in a 1966 Worlds of Tomorrow essay, \\"Immortality Through Freezing\\".Science Fiction Citations Database for the Oxford English Dictionary Plot summary In the story, Organlegging is rampant on Earth in the early 22nd century. In an attempt to alleviate the problem, the UN had passed the first \\"Freezer Law\\", declaring paupers in cryogenic suspension to be dead in law, allowing their organs to be harvested and made available for transplant. A few years later with the organ banks running low, the second \\"Freezer Law\\" is going through the legislative process, this time targeting the insane, some quite wealthy. This despite cures existing for most forms of insanity. After a visit to the local cryogenic facility, Hamilton is finishing lunch with an acquaintance, when he is shot at in a seemingly random act by a local lunatic. Closer investigation reveals the attacker to be a former organlegger who retired after the first Freezer Bill went into law. The plot becomes more complicated with the involvement of a potential to a considerable fortune who had been kidnapped, along with his sister, and then released, though the sister was left in a state of catatonia that doctors cannot cure. The heir has minor personality changes, but was apparently not otherwise affected by their ordeal, though he claims to remember nothing of it. Gil solves the case by deduction and also with his \\"phantom arm\\" that enables him to manipulate objects and sense things with an imaginary sense of touch, even through a 3-D videophone connection. Although the heir looks the same, his body hosts the brain and spinal column of a top boss organlegger. The sister was subjected to weeks of electrical stimulation of her brain to turn her into a \\"wirehead\\" who cannot function without stimulation of the pleasure center. During Hamilton's lunch, the organlegger saw Hamilton looking at him and convinced himself that Hamilton knew his real identity. The attack was a response, but its failure caused Hamilton to investigate everyone in the restaurant instead. With the apparent involvement of an organlegger in the second Freezer Bill, there are worldwide protests against it, and Hamilton and his boss speculate that the bill will be defeated.

Secular prelates tried to protect the Jews. Arnold, the Archbishop of Cologne gave them a fortified castle as refuge, and allowed them to arm themselves; the Crusaders refrained from attacking the castle, but killed any unconverted Jew that fell into their clutches. Henry I, Archbishop of Mainz admitted into his house some Jews pursued by a mob; the mob forced its way in, and killed them before his eyes. The Archbishops appealed to Bernard of Clairvaux, the most influential Christian of his time; Bernard replied with a strong denunciation of Radulphe, and demanded an end to violence against the Jews. When Radulphe continued his campaign Bernard came in person to Germany, \\"protested energetically against the unchristian behavior of Radulph\\" and forced the monk to return to his monastery. Thereafter in 1147 the mutilated body of a Christian was found at Würzburg; Christians charged Jews with the crime, and, despite the protests of Bishop Emicho von Leiningen, attacked them, killing 20 and wounding many more; the Bishop buried the dead in his garden.

It is the biggest football tragedy in Greece's history, and among the worst in sports history. A total number of 21 people, 20 supporters of Olympiacos and 1 supporter of AEK, lost their lives while rushing out of the stadium to celebrate the victory of Olympiacos against AEK Athens (6–0). The accident occurred in the historic Gate 7 (Θύρα 7). The stadium has since been rebuilt as a modern football field (not a stadium). There are still debates regarding the causes that led to the disaster. The main cause of the accident, according to the official police report, seems to have been a partially closed door. While exiting, some fans lost their balance and fell on the last steps. Dozens fell onto each other and were stepped over by a horde of unsuspecting fans who kept coming, making it for most of them extremely difficult to stand up or even defend themselves somehow. 19 supporters lost their lives within the stadium, while another two died of their wounds in hospital. At least 55 more were injured, many of them with major injuries. Most of the dead and wounded were teenagers and young adults. The accident occurred in the Gate 7 of the stadium, the gate where supporters of Olympiacos were concentrated, however, one of the victims was reported to be a supporter of AEK Athens FC friend with an Olympiacos supporter. In memory of this event, every year on February 8, there is a memorial service at the stadium in honor of the supporters that died in that incident. The service is attended by thousands of fans every year, who are rhythmically shouting the phrase \\"Αδέρφια, ζείτε, εσείς μας οδηγείτε.\\" (Adhérfia, zíte, esís mas odhiyíte, \\"Brothers, you live, you are the ones who guide us.\\"). At the tribune part of the stadium where Gate 7 is now, some seats are colored black instead of red, shaping the number \\"7\\", whereas there is also a monument on the eastern side of the stadium, bearing the names of all 21 supporters killed on that day in the stadium. Even though this incident affected almost solely the fanbase of Olympiacos, other teams occasionally pay their respects to the people killed as well, as they consider the incident to be a tragedy not only for one team but for the whole country. In the past, even foreign teams, such as Liverpool F.C. and Red Star Belgrade have honored the incident's victims. \\"Gate 7\\" (Θύρα 7), οne of the biggest and most supportive fan clubs of Olympiacos, was named after the incident. Although \\"Gate 7\\" members are generally considered to be ultras, the people sitting in that gate before and during the incident were normal supporters, without season tickets (as in the old stadium only gate 1 - which was a VIP gate - supported some season tickets).

Description This genus of dioecious evergreen trees and shrubs has 140 species, in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, with 17 Chinese species, 13 of which are endemic. The trees are 3 to 25 m tall, with leaves usually clustered or nearly verticillate, rarely alternate or opposite, unlobed, pinninerved, and rarely triplinerved. The flowers are star-shaped, small, and greenish. The flowers are clustered or whorled and are unisexual.Flora of China Umbels are solitary or clustered or arranged in a panicle or raceme; involucral bracts are imbricated and caducous. The perianth tube is short; perianth segments usually number six in two whorls of three each, nearly equal, and rarely persistent. The male flowers have fertile stamens usually 9 in three whorls of three each; filaments of the first and second whorls are eglandular, and of the third whorl are biglandular at the base; anthers are all introrse and four-celled; cells openg by lids; the rudimentary pistil is small or lacking. The female flowers has staminodes as many as stamens of male flowers; the ovary is superior; the stigma is shield- shaped or dilated. The fruit is a berry-like drupe seated on shallow or deep, cup-shaped or discoid, perianth tube. It has a small single seed dispersed mostly by birds.

See Early human migrations for migration prior to the Neolithic, History of human migration for modern history, and human migration for contemporary migration. Paleolithic migration prior to end of the Last Glacial Maximum spread anatomically modern humans throughout Afro-Eurasia and to the Americas. During the Holocene climatic optimum, formerly isolated populations began to move and merge, giving rise to the pre-modern distribution of the world's major language families. In the wake of the population movements of the Mesolithic came the Neolithic revolution, followed by the Indo-European expansion in Eurasia and the Bantu expansion in Africa. Population movements of the proto-historical or early historical period include the Migration period, followed by (or connected to) the Slavic, Magyar, Norse, Turkic and Mongol expansions of the medieval period. The last world regions to be permanently settled were the Pacific Islands and the Arctic, reached during the 1st millennium AD. Since the beginning of the Age of Exploration and the beginning of the Early Modern period and its emerging colonial empires, an accelerated pace of migration on the intercontinental scale became possible.

From there, it propagated as a \\"wave\\" across Europe, a view supported by Archaeogenetics, reaching northern Europe some 5 millennia ago. Some evidence (including a 2016 study by Busby et al.) suggests admixture from an ancient migration from Eurasia into parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Another study (Ramsay et al. 2018) also shows evidence that ancient Eurasians migrated into Africa and that Eurasian admixture in modern Sub-Saharan Africans ranges from 0% to 50%, varying by region and generally highest (after North Africa) in the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel zone. =Bronze Age = Scheme of Indo-European migrations from c. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the Kurgan hypothesis. The purple area corresponds to the assumed Urheimat (Samara culture, Sredny Stog culture). The red area corresponds to the area which may have been settled by Indo-European-speaking peoples up to c. 2500 BC; the orange area to 1000 BC. The proposed Indo-European migration has variously been dated to the end of the Neolithic (Marija Gimbutas: Corded Ware culture, Yamna culture, Kurgan culture), the early Neolithic (Colin Renfrew: Starčevo- Körös, Linearbandkeramic) and the late Palaeolithic (Marcel Otte, Paleolithic Continuity Theory). The speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language are usually believed to have originated to the North of the Black Sea (today Eastern Ukraine and Southern Russia), and from there they gradually migrated into, and spread their language by cultural diffusion to, Anatolia, Europe, and Central Asia Iran and South Asia starting from around the end of the Neolithic period (see Kurgan hypothesis). Other theories, such as that of Colin Renfrew, posit their development much earlier, in Anatolia, and claim that Indo-European languages and culture spread as a result of the agricultural revolution in the early Neolithic. Relatively little is known about the inhabitants of pre-Indo-European \\"Old Europe\\". The Basque language remains from that era, as do the indigenous languages of the Caucasus. The Sami are genetically distinct among the peoples of Europe, but the Sami languages, as part of the Uralic languages, spread into Europe about the same time as the Indo-European languages. However, since that period speakers of other Uralic languages such as the Finns and the Estonians have had more contact with other Europeans, thus today sharing more genes with them than the Sami. The earliest migrations we can reconstruct from historical sources are those of the 2nd millennium BC. The Proto-Indo-Iranians began their expansion from c. 2000 BC, the Rigveda documenting the presence of early Indo-Aryans in the Punjab from the late 2nd millennium BC, and Iranian tribes being attested in Assyrian sources as in the Iranian plateau from the 9th century BC. In the Late Bronze Age, the Aegean and Anatolia were overrun by moving populations, summarized as the \\"Sea Peoples\\", leading to the collapse of the Hittite Empire and ushering in the Iron Age. =Austronesian expansion= Austronesians expansion map The islands of the Pacific were populated during c. 1600 BC and AD 1000. The Lapita people, who got their name from the archaeological site in Lapita, New Caledonia, where their characteristic pottery was first discovered, came from Austronesia, probably New Guinea, reaching the Solomon Islands, around 1600 BC, and later to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. By the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, most of Polynesia was a loose web of thriving cultures who settled on the islands' coasts and lived off the sea. By 500 BC Micronesia was completely colonized; the last region of Polynesia to be reached was New Zealand in around 1000. Celtic expansion in Europe, 6th–3rd century BC =Bantu expansion= The Bantu expansion is the major prehistoric migratory pattern that shaped the ethno-linguistic composition of Sub-Saharan Africa. \\"four stages of the Bantu expansion: first, the initial push through the equatorial forest from the northern to the southern woodlands; second, the occupation of the southern woodland belt from coast to coast; third, the colonization of the Tanzania, Kenya and southern Somali coastline and of the northern sector of the lake region; fourth, the colonization south-wards, north-westwards and north-eastwards from this extended nucleus.\\" The Bantu, a branch of the Niger-Congo phylum, originated in West Africa around the Benue-Cross rivers area in southeastern Nigeria. Beginning in the 2nd millennium BC, they spread to Central Africa, and later, during the 1st millennium BC onward southeastern, spreading pastoralism and agriculture. During the 1st millennium AD, they populated Southern African. In the process, the Bantu languages displaced the Khoisan languages indigenous to Central and Southern Africa. =Arctic peoples= The final region to be permanently settled by humans was the Arctic, reached by the Dorset culture during about 500 BC to AD 1500. The Inuit are the descendants of the Thule culture, which emerged from western Alaska around AD 1000 and gradually displaced the Dorset culture. Proto-historical and early historical migration Map of Phoenician (in yellow) and Greek colonies (in red) around 8th to 6th century BC Map showing the southward migration of the Han Chinese (in blue) The German term Landnahme (\\"land-taking\\") is sometimes used in historiography for a migration event associated with a founding legend, e.g. of the conquest of Canaan in the Hebrew Bible, the Indo-Aryan migration and expansion within India alluded to in the Rigveda, the invasion traditions in the Irish Mythological Cycle, accounting for how the Gaels came to Ireland the arrival of the Franks in Austrasia during the Migration period, the Anglo- Saxon invasion of Britain, the settlement of Iceland in the Viking Age, the Slavic migrations, the Hungarian conquest , etc. =Iron Age= The Dorian invasion of Greece led to the Greek Dark Ages. The Urartians were displaced by Armenians, and the Cimmerians and the Mushki migrated from the Caucasus into Anatolia. A Thraco-Cimmerian connection links these movements to the Proto- Celtic world of central Europe, leading to the introduction of Iron to Europe and the Celtic expansion to western Europe and the British Isles around 500 BC. =Migration period= map of the world in 820. Slavic peoples in the 5th to 10th centuries. Western historians refer to the period of migrations that separated Antiquity from the Middle Ages in Europe as the Great Migrations or as the Migrations Period. This period is further divided into two phases. The first phase, from 300 to 500, saw the movement of Germanic, Sarmatian and Hunnic tribes and ended with the settlement of these peoples in the areas of the former Western Roman Empire. (See also: Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Burgundians, Suebi, Alamanni, Marcomanni). The second phase, between 500 and 900, saw Slavic, Turkic and other tribes on the move, re- settling in Eastern Europe and gradually making it predominantly Slavic. Moreover, more Germanic tribes migrated within Europe during this period, including the Lombards (to Italy), and the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes (to the British Isles). See also: Avars, Bulgars, Huns, Arabs, Vikings, Varangians. The last phase of the migrations saw the coming of the Hungarians to the Pannonian plain. German historians of the 19th century referred to these Germanic migrations as the Völkerwanderung, the migrations of the peoples. The European migration period is connected with the simultaneous Turkic expansion which at first displaced other peoples towards the west, and by High Medieval times, the Seljuk Turks themselves reached the Mediterranean. =Early medieval period= The medieval period, although often presented as a time of limited human mobility and slow social change in the history of Europe, in fact saw widespread movement of peoples. The Vikings from Scandinavia raided all over Europe from the 8th century and settled in many places, including Normandy, the north of England, Scotland and Ireland (most of whose urban centres were founded by the Vikings). The Normans later conquered the Saxon Kingdom of England, most of Ireland, southern Italy and Sicily. Iberia was invaded by Muslim Arabs, Berbers and Moors in the 8th century, founding new Kingdoms such as al Andalus and bringing with them a wave of settlers from North Africa. The invasion of North Africa by the Banu Hilal, a warlike Arab Bedouin tribe, was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural Arabization of the Maghreb. Late Middle Ages Massive migrations of Germans took place into East Central and Eastern Europe, reaching its peak in the 12th to 14th centuries. These Ostsiedlung settlements in part followed territorial gains of the Holy Roman Empire, but areas beyond were settled, too. At the end of the Middle Ages, the Romani (gypsies) arrived in Europe from the Middle East. They originate in India, probably an offshoot of the Domba people of Northern India who had left for Sassanid Persia around the 5th century. Early Modern period Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south (the Nam tiến, 1069–1757). =Early Modern Europe= Internal European migration stepped up in the Early Modern Period. In this period, major migration within Europe included the recruiting by monarchs of landless laborers to settle depopulated or uncultivated regions and a series of forced migration caused by religious persecution. Notable examples of this phenomenon include the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, mass migration of Protestants from the Spanish Netherlands to the Dutch Republic after the 1580s, the expulsion of the Moriscos (descendants of former Muslims) from Spain in 1609, and the expulsion of the Huguenots from France in the 1680s. Since the 14th century, the Serbs started leaving the areas of their medieval Kingdom and Empire that was overrun by the Ottoman Turks and migrated to the north, to the lands of today's Vojvodina (northern Serbia), which was ruled by the Kingdom of Hungary at that time. The Habsburg monarchs of Austria encouraged them to settle on their frontier with the Turks and provide military service by granting them free land and religious toleration. The two greatest migrations took place in 1690 and 1737. Other instances of labour recruitments include the Plantations of Ireland - the settling of Ireland with Protestant colonists from England, Scotland and Wales in the period 1560–1690 and the recruitment of Germans by Catherine the Great of Russia to settle the Volga region in the 18th century. =Colonial empires= European Colonialism from the 16th to the early 20th centuries led to an imposition of a European colonies in many regions of the world, particularly in the Americas, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Australia, where European languages remain either prevalent or in frequent use as administrative languages. Major human migration before the 18th century was largely state directed. For instance, Spanish emigration to the New World was limited to settlers from Castile who were intended to act as soldiers or administrators. Mass immigration was not encouraged due to a labour shortage in Europe (of which Spain was the worst affected by a depopulation of its core territories in the 17th century). Europeans also tended to die of tropical diseases in the New World in this period and for this reason England, France and Spain preferred using slaves as free labor in their American possessions. Many historians attribute a change in this pattern in the 18th century to population increases in Europe. However, in the less tropical regions of North America's east coast, large numbers of religious dissidents, mostly English Puritans, settled during the early 17th century. Spanish restrictions on emigration to Latin America were revoked and the English colonies in North America also saw a major influx of settlers attracted by cheap or free land, economic opportunity and the continued lure of religious toleration. A period in which various early English colonies had a significant amount of self-rule prevailed from the time of the Plymouth colony's founding in 1620 through 1676, as the mother country was wracked by revolution and general instability. However, King William III decisively intervened in colonial affairs after 1688 and the English colonies gradually came more directly under royal governance, with a marked effect on the type of emigration. During the early 18th century, significant numbers of non-English seekers of greater religious and political freedom were allowed to settle within the British colonies, including Protestant Palatine Germans displaced by French conquest, French Huguenots disenfranchised by an end of religious tolerance, Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, Quakers who were often Welsh, as well as Presbyterian and Catholic Scottish Highlanders seeking a new start after a series of unsuccessful revolts. Map of colonial empires throughout the world in 1754, prior to the Seven Years' War The English colonists who came during this period were increasingly moved by economic necessity. Some colonies, including Georgia, were settled heavily by petty criminals and indentured servants who hoped to pay off their debts. By 1800, European emigration had transformed the demographic character of the American continent. This was due to the devastating effect of European diseases and warfare on Native American populations. The European settlers' influence elsewhere was less pronounced as in South Asia and Africa, European settlement in this period was limited to a thin layer of administrators, traders and soldiers.

Although the film's title is very similar to the German silent horror film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), it shares very few similarities except for the main plot twist. The film's script was written by Robert Bloch, author of the novel Psycho. The cinematographer for The Cabinet of Caligari was John L. Russell, who also worked on Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho (1960). Plot Motorist Jane Lindstrom (Glynis Johns) has a tire blowout and seeks assistance at an estate owned by Caligari (Dan O'Herlihy), a very polite man with a Welsh accent. After spending the night there, she finds that Caligari will not let her leave; he proceeds to ask some personal questions and shows her pictures that offend her. Prevented by guards from leaving and unable to use the telephone, Jane seeks allies among the other guests. She finds only three possible candidates the older Paul, the younger Mark (Dick Davalos), for whom she has romantic desires, and a lively elderly woman named Ruth (Estelle Winwood). After seeing Ruth tortured, Jane goes to Paul who convinces her to confront Caligari. Jane does so and tries to seduce him, as she suspects he has been spying on her in the bath. After her attempts fail, Caligari reveals that he and Paul and are one and the same person, Jane runs down a corridor of wildly shifting imagery that acts as a transition. Finally, it is revealed that Jane is a mental patient and everything the audience has seen up to this point has been her distortion of the institute she was in: the personal questions were psychoanalysis, the pictures were Rorschach blots, Ruth's torture was shock treatment, and even Caligari's coat of arms was a distorted version of the medical caduceus symbol. Cured, Jane is taken from the asylum by Mark, now revealed to be her son. Cast * Glynis Johns as Jane * Dan O'Herlihy as Paul/Caligari * Dick Davalos as Mark * Lawrence Dobkin as David * Constance Ford as Christine * Estelle Winwood as Ruth * J. Pat O'Malley as Perkins Production Sam Goldwyn bought the remake rights in 1921. He assigned the project to French-born Roger Kay, who had directed Grand Guignol theatre in Paris and New York. He also had degrees in psychology. The director Roger Kay persuaded Robert Bloch \\"to drop the Dr from the original title but do a story with enough similarity to be recognizable as an homage.\\" Once Around the Bloch: An Autobiography, p. 258. At one stage, the film was just known as Caligari. The story of the way director Roger Kay tried to rob Bloch of the writing credit for the film and how Bloch won is told in Bloch's autobiography.Once Around the Bloch: An Autobiography (1993), pp. 258-62, 264-68 Lippert's movies around this time normally cost $500,000, but Lippert allowed extra funds for this movie. It was shot over 25 days. Harry Spalding, who worked for Lippert, later recalled that everyone in their organization thought making the film was a bad idea except for Lippert. He says the director hired Robert Bloch to write the script, but they had a falling out and the director wrote the script himself. Bloch's signing was announced in July 1961. Glynis Johns was signed in November. Maury Dexter, head of Lippert's company, says Lippert told him \\"to give Roger [Kay] a wide berth because he expected great things from him.\\" Kay used a color chart when making the film. He went through the script and allocated a color representing the emotion the audience was to feel. \\"The new Caligari is completely modern\\", said Kay during filming. \\"I don't want to sound presumptuous but I am trying to get the Pirandello approach that says nothing is what it appears to be. The thesis behind the damsel in distress, behind the little thrills and shocks is, What is reality?\\" \\"This picture is going to cause a lot of talk\\", said Lippert. Dexter says once he read the script and saw how different the film would be from the original, he advised Lippert to fire Kay, but Lippert backed the director. He also says Kay yelled at Glynis Johns during filming and Johns ran off the set; Lippert forced Kay to apologize so filming could continue. Reception Dexter says the film was a critical and financial failure. In 1963, Kay said he \\"disowns\\" the film, blaming Fox for turning it into a \\"lurid, sex charged picture\\" and claiming the version released was \\"considerably different\\" from his version. He said a copy of his original cut was with the Museum of Modern Art. Lippert wanted to reunite O'Herily and Johns in an adaptation of Trilby, but no film resulted.

Biography Hakon Claes Axel Ahlberg was born at Laholm in Halland County, Sweden. He studied architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, completing his studies in 1914. He also undertook studies at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1914–1917, one of his most influential teachers being Ivar Tengbom. Ahlberg established his own office in 1917. Ahlberg was best known as the official architect for the repair and restoration of Gripsholm Castle near the town of Mariefred in central Sweden. He was one of the founding members and first president of the Swedish Architects’ Association, and was well known as an active participant in architectural debate in Sweden, and was editor-in- chief of the Swedish architectural journals Arkitekten in 1922 and Byggmästaren 1922–24. He was also president of the Swedish Academy of Fine Arts 1954–62. Ahlberg's principal role in Swedish architecture was not as a “leader of style” but as an idealistic leader, as an organiser and spokesman of the Swedish architectural profession. The International Who's Who 1943–44. 8th edition. George Allen & Unwin, London, 1943, p. 7. As an architect he was part of the brief movement called Nordic Classicism, but with clear links with Swedish vernacular architecture, as expressed in the simple wooden houses he designed for the Swedish trade union-run folk high school (Brunnsviks folkhögskola) at Brunnsvik in Ludvika parish during 1928. He designed a number of churches (e.g. Mälarhöjden Church, Stockholm, 1929), museums, and hospitals as well as housing. His most important works are the Arts and Crafts pavilion at the Gothenburg exhibition in 1923, and the PUB department store in central Stockholm from 1924. Ahlberg designed a number of hospitals, including the Sidsjön mental hospital in Sundsvall 1939–44, the Children's clinic in Oslo, Norway (1946–50), and the University Hospital in Maracaibo in Venezuela (1946–54). In 1957 Ahlberg was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal and in 1973 the Alvar Aalto Medal. Ahlberg’s architectural office closed in 1973. he died at Stockholm in 1984.

Besides providing for the division of the colony into provinces and districts for the election of members of Parliament, for the creation of an electoral roll and for other matters, the Act also introduced voting by secret ballot in the colony of Victoria. It provided for a government–supplied ballot paper containing each candidates' names.Section 36 of Act The elector was required to cross out the name of those candidates he (and it was only he) did not wish to vote for, fold the ballot paper in a way that the vote could not be seen and place the ballot paper in a ballot box in view of the polling officers. The Act was passed by a one-vote majority in the outgoing Legislative Council on 13 March 1856, and received assent from the Governor of Victoria on 19 March of the same year,Payment of Members Act 1870 (Vic) in time for the election of the new Parliament of Victoria later that year. The innovation of the secret ballot was pioneered in Victoria by the former mayor of Melbourne, William Nicholson.Blainey, G 2016, ‘'The story of Australia’s people: the rise and rise of a new Australia'’, Viking, Penguin Random House, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia, p.18. Victoria was the fourth jurisdiction in the world to enacted a law for a secret ballot. France adopted a secret ballot law in 1795. The movement for a secret ballot in South Australia was led by pioneer and advocate South Australian Electoral Commissioner William Boothby.Australian Dictionary of Biography, William Boothby Tasmania adopted a secret ballot law on 7 February 1856. South Australia enacted a similar law two weeks after the Victorian law, on 2 April 1856. The South Australian system in 1858 required an elector to place an X against the name of his preferred candidate instead of crossing out unwanted names and for the ballot paper to show 'no other matter or thing' apart from the names of candidates and on the back the returning officer's initials. The other Australian colonies followed the SA example: New South Wales (1858), Queensland (1859), and Western Australia (1877). New Zealand implemented secret voting in 1870. When the secret ballot was adopted in the United States, it was called 'the Australian ballot'. References Further reading *National Archives of Australia.

The route extends for about from NY 207 in the town of New Windsor to NY 17K in the town of Montgomery. It officially came into existence when exit 5A on Interstate 84 was completed and opened in 2007. Most of NY 747 follows Drury Lane, once a highway maintained by Orange County as County Route 54\\\\. The road provides easy access to Stewart International Airport via International Boulevard, a newly built connecting road. The lack of such access has long been seen as an obstacle to the airport's development. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has taken the airport over from former private lessees National Express with the intent of realizing long-held hopes of making the airport the New York Metropolitan Area's fourth major airport; improved access to the airport is seen as essential to that goal. Drury Lane, which divided the airport property from what is now Stewart State Forest, save for a small corridor along the road near the interstate, was long the line in the sand for local environmental activists who opposed any development to its west. Construction of the highway involved significant relocation of some of the route for these and other issues. Route description The entire route runs through wooded land that has remained undeveloped since being seized for a planned expansion of the airport in the early 1970s. 747 begins at the junction of Drury and NY 207 near the Grange Hall at the center of the onetime hamlet of Little Britain. A traffic light was installed at the intersection. It remains a two-lane road along a new alignment through the wooded area between the airport and the state forest. At the junction with International Boulevard, it expands to a four-lane divided route from there to I-84. Here it passes the western end of the airport's main runway, and sometimes large C-5 cargo planes from Stewart Air National Guard Base can be seen taking off right above the road. While one more traffic light has been allowed in this section, development here will likely be limited since much of the land to the west is either wetlands or part of the FAA-mandated Runway Protection Zone, a trapezoid in which no building is allowed. The road climbs slightly into the Town of Newburgh and then to the exit. A new overpass was built; the old one was dismantled. The westbound Interstate 84 exit and entrance takes the form of half of a diamond interchange, while the eastbound exit and entrance forms half of an A2/B2 type partial cloverleaf to avoid encroaching on wetlands in the southwest quadrant of the interchange. alt=A video, four and a half minutes long, showing a complete trip along the highway from its southern end to its north The ramp from westbound 84 to 747 goes over a small bridge built to protect the Catskill Aqueduct from the vibrations of passing trucks. The presence of the aqueduct, which carries 40% of New York City's water supply and runs right alongside the road just north of 84, forced the construction of a new section of road a short distance north of the interstate. Route 747 here deviates from the historical route of Drury Lane, bends into the Town of Montgomery and reaches NY 17K, its northern terminus, at the intersection with Stone Castle Road. The section of Stone Castle Road north of Route 17K has itself been slightly relocated to provide for a better location for the intersection, at which another traffic light was erected. The remaining section of Drury Lane, which has houses and businesses, now ends in a cul-de-sac near the new road and the aqueduct. This small stub of a road remains the outlet for several small private roads which end in cul-de-sacs of their own. A few structures formerly on the west side of Drury Lane now remain on the west side of the renamed Route 747\\\\. Despite this plan, a new Valero-branded convenience store and gas station has been opened at the current intersection of 17K and Drury to take advantage of interstate traffic coming off the exit. History New overpass under construction at I-84 in February 2007 The construction of Route 747 is the culmination of a lengthy regional controversy about the airport and the role it should play in the local economy. Before the 1970 closure of Stewart Air Force Base, Drury Lane was just another two-lane rural north-south route in the farmlands west of the base. =Development controversy= Plans initiated by then-governor Nelson Rockefeller changed that. With supersonic transport (SST) considered at the time to be the next major development in air travel, Rockefeller wanted New York to have an airport that could handle both the SSTs and regular jets. Accordingly, plans were drawn up for a major expansion of the airport. The state moved to condemn much of the land between Drury Lane and Maybrook in order to more than double Stewart's size. Families that had lived there since the Revolution fought bitterly. Eventually they were all evicted, but only after the state had promised never to develop the land and American SST development was canceled due to rising fuel costs. The new route of 747, left, forking from Drury Lane, middle, at the Catskill Aqueduct, right. In the years that followed, environmental and business activists in the region clashed over what to do with the west of Drury. The former saw the recreational and conservation possibilities of keeping it a protected area; the latter pointed to ideal real estate in a region that was beginning to lose its job base. The privatization of the airport in 2000 led the state to finally begin construction of the interchange, after Governor George Pataki designated much of the western lands as Stewart State Forest. It was stalled for three years by a lawsuit filed by several national and local environmental groups alleging that required environmental reviews were not properly conducted. On November 21, 2005, a compromise was reached in which most of the land that had not been designated as part of the state forest was and near the exit was made available for development. Construction of the exit and the surrounding roads proceeded apace. =Construction= Drury Lane as it was could not serve to bring the kind of traffic a major airport would handle. The road would have to be widened to at least four lanes and realigned. The presence of the aqueduct also complicated matters greatly. New York City's Department of Environmental Protection insisted that any new roads over the aqueduct bridge it to protect the aging pipeline from damage that vibrations from trucks passing overhead could cause. The cut for the new access road. Since Drury crosses the aqueduct north of the interstate on relatively level ground, a bridge would have added considerable expense to the project. However, a federally required 1999 value engineering study recommended instead rerouting Drury to make a four-way intersection at Stone Castle Road and Route 17K. While at the time there were some other issues seen as holding this up, eventually this was the option chosen. The access road required some deep cuts to keep it level at the intersection with Drury Lane. Bill Gorton, NYSDOT's regional design engineer, compared it to the initial construction of I-84. \\"We tell our young engineers to take a good look at what we're doing here because chances are they won't see anything like this again in their careers\\", said Rashid Shariff, DOT's engineer in charge. Over of dirt were moved. A quarter of that was used to fill a ravine the road crosses; the rest will be used as needed on the airport property. Southern terminus as of 2007. Old route on left; current route being constructed on right The project's design took into account several considerations for rare or endangered species native to the area, which earned it an Exemplary Ecosystem Initiative award from the Federal Highway Administration. These included the construction of 12 vernal pools adjacent to the road to provide habitat for the Blue-spotted Salamander and Jefferson Salamander and box culverts to allow them to safely cross under the road, avoiding tree removal during the season when Indiana bats are roosting, and siting new wetlands to avoid impacting Purple milkweed. Prior to the project, Drury Lane had been maintained by Orange County as County Route 54\\\\. In February 2007, it was announced that the highway would become state- maintained and be designated as NY 747 once the project was completed. On July 30, 2007, Route 747 was de facto open. Drury Lane was closed off north of the aqueduct and traffic was routed onto the new roadway between both termini, and on the new overpass. Road crews began removing the pavement from the former roadbed and dismantling the old overpass. The long east-west airport access road from Route 747 to the main terminal, International Boulevard, was opened on November 20, 2007, officially completing the $55 million project. Although NYSDOT refers to this access road as Stewart Boulevard in their press release, all area signage refers to the access road as International Boulevard, a last- minute change by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

History  The Ryan Round Barn was built for Laurence Ryan and completed in 1910 by German immigrant named Feurst. Ryan was a well-known brain surgeon in Chicago who was from Kewanee. He attended medical school at Loyola University and trained in Berlin and Vienna, later becoming the dean of the Medical School at Loyola. In 1908, he purchased 320 acres of land for a retreat from Chicago and the medical world and to explore his hobby of raising Black Angus cattle. The barn was intended to be where the cattle housed, fed and groomed under one roof. After Ryan's death in 1939, the barn was sold to E. A. Johnson of Annawan until it was sold to the state in 1967. The barn was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974; it was the first round barn in the state to be added to the Register. In 1984, the Friends of Johnson Park Foundation was founded for the express purpose of saving the Round Barn. Currently, the barn features a display of antique farm machinery and implements, and is open to visitors seasonally.  Design  The barn is tall and in diameter, making it the largest round barn in Illinois. The interior of the barn has three and a half levels and a central silo. The roof features four gambrel dormers spaced evenly around the edge and a cupola at the top. The side board are constructed horizontally to form continuous circles.

He is remembered in connection with the monti di pietà of which he was the reorganizer and, in a certain sense, the founder, together with the Blessed Michele Carcano. The feast of Blessed Bernardino is kept in the Order of Friars Minor on 28 September. Life Born Martin Tomitani, he belonged to the noble family of Tomitano and was the eldest of nine children. In 1456, while a law student in Padua, he heard St. James of the Marches preach the Lenten course and was inspired to enter the Franciscan order, taking the name Bernardino, after Bernardino of Siena.Sabbatelli, Giacomo V., \\"Blessed Bernardino da Feltre\\", Santi e Beati, February 2, 2001 In May that year he joined the “Observantine” Franciscans, an austere branch of the Franciscan friars. He completed successfully his studies at Mantua and was ordained priest in 1463.“Blessed Bernardine of Feltre”. New Catholic Dictionary. CatholicSaints.Info. 16 August 2012 He was small, shy, and stammered but his superiors assigned him to preach home-missions. Cured of an impediment in his speech, Bernardine began his apostolate up and down the Italian peninsula. Every city of note and every province from Lombardy in the north to Sardinia and the provinces of the south became successively the scene of his missionary labours.Donovan, Stephen. \\"Bl. Bernardine of Feltre.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 4 September 2017 He was an extremely popular preacher because he spoke simply and powerfully against the vanity, ambition and greed rife at the time. The crowds that flocked to hear him were too large for the local churches, so he addressed them in the city squares and the fields. Like many other missioners of his century, he had made a vast outdoor bonfire called “burning the Devil's stronghold”. The crowds were asked to throw into the fire all objects of vanity and sin such as playing cards, dice, pornographic books and pictures, jewelry, wigs, superstitious charms, cosmetics, and so forth. Bernardine was able to reconcile warring communities. He also sought civic legislation to correct public injustices such as usury, the charging of excessive interest for loans, which was especially onerous on the poor. In 1484, Bernardine established the charitable credit organization, mont-de-piétés run by a joint committee of clergy and laymen. The institution was founded as an alternative to the high interest loans of the money lenders and Lombard traveling bankers of the Middle Ages. His fund raising drives were generally preceded with a procession featuring an image of either the Man of Sorrows or Pietà to encourage charitable donations.Puglisi Catherine R. and Barcham, William L., \\"Bernardino da Feltre, the Monte di Pietà and the Man of Sorrows: Activist, Microcredit and Logo\\", Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 29, No. 58 (2008) His insistence on charging a low interest to protect the institution's permanency raised a controversy among the theologians who thought it promoted the continuance of usury. (In 1515, Pope Leo X declared the institution meritorious and it spread rapidly throughout France, Italy, and Spain.) In 1491, Bernardine was expelled from Milan by Ludovico Sforza for contesting with the Duke's astrologer. Anti-Semitism With the practical notion of establishing monts-de-piété, he called for the expulsion of Jews all over Italy and Tyrol. However, no secular or ecclesiastical authorities specifically took up Bernardine's call. This led Bernardine to accuse the nobility of having sold out to Jehiel of Pisa, one of the wealthiest Jews in Italy. However, one effect of his preaching against usury was the outbreak of anti-semitism in Trent based around the blood libel conspiracy against Jewish residents after the death of Simon of Trent. This led to the torture and execution of seventeen Jews and the expulsion of the remainder from that city, with no return for the next 300 years. Iconography Bernardine is generally represented in iconography as carrying in his hand a monti di pietà, that is, a little green hill composed of three mounds and on the top either a cross or a standard with the inscription Curam illius habe (a snippet from the Vulgate translation of the Gospel of Luke's Parable of the Good Samaritan). Works The authorship of the well-known Anima Christi has as often as not been ascribed to Bernardine of Feltre. The fact, however, that the Anima Christi was composed sometime before 1439 disproves any claim that he might have of being its author, though much like Ignatius of Loyola, Bernardine made frequent use of it and recommended it to his brethren.

Plot Returning home from the War of 1812, John Breen, a Kentucky militiaman, falls in love with French exile Fleurette de Marchand (Vera Ralston). He discovers a plot to steal the land that Fleurette's exiles plan to settle on. Breen is mistaken for a land surveyor and is presented with a theodolite and sets out with Willie (Oliver Hardy) to look as if they are surveying (they do not actually know what to do). A further pretence occurs when Breen sits on stage with a group of fiddlers and feigns being able to play. Throughout the film, Breen's soldiers sing: :Only six hundred miles more to go :Only six hundred miles more to go :And if we can just get lucky :We will end up in Kentucky :Only six hundred miles more to go When the song is first heard, there are eight hundred miles to go (the tune is She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain). Historical setting The story is set in Alabama in 1818, including the city of Demopolis, which was founded by Bonapartists. The Bonapartists had been exiled from France after the defeat of Napoleon I at the Battle of Waterloo. Congress authorized the sale of four townships in the Alabama Territory in March 1817 at two dollars per acre, and Marengo County was created on February 7, 1818 from lands that had been taken from the Choctaw Nation. It was named after Spinetta Marengo, Italy where Napoleon defeated Austria in 1800 in the Battle of Marengo. The county seat, Linden, Alabama, was named after Hohenlinden, Bavaria where Napoleon won another victory against the Austrians. The Bonapartist colony did not succeed overall, in part due to surveyance issues that contribute to the plot of the film and in part due to practical difficulties in establishing the vineyards.Bonapartist refugees in Americas 1815-50Encyclopedia of Alabama Marengo County Latitude 34 North: Marengo County (46) Historic Markers Across Alabama  Cast  * John Wayne as John Breen * Vera Ralston as Fleurette de Marchand * Philip Dorn as Col.

Extending from 89° 42′ E to 96° E longitude and 24° 8′ N to 28° 2′ N latitude, it has an area of 78,438 km2, similar to that of Ireland or Austria. Geology Plate Movements and Rise of the Himalayas Geologically, as per the plate tectonics, Assam is in the easternmost projection of the Indian Plate, where it thrusts underneath the Eurasian Plate creating a subduction zone. It is postulated that due to the northeasterly movement of the Indian plate, the sedimentary layers of an ancient geosyncline called the Tethys (in between Indian and Eurasian Plates) were pushed upward to form the Himalayas. It is estimated that the height of the Himalayas is increasing by 4 cm each year. Therefore, Assam possesses a special geomorphic environment, with large plains and dissected hills of the South Indian Plateau system abutting the Himalayas to the north, north-east and east. Geomorphic studies also conclude that the Brahmaputra is an antecedent river, older than the Himalayas, which often crosses higher altitudes in the Himalayas eroding at a greater pace than the increase in the height of the mountain range to sustain its flow. The height of the surrounding regions still increasing forming steep gorges in Arunachal. Some say that the \\"flow\\" is usually neutral. The flow includes water, land, air, and other resources too. Entering the Assam region, the Brahmaputra becomes a braided river, and, along with its tributaries, creates the flood plain of the Brahmaputra Valley. Physiography The Braided River Brahmaputra The state of Assam comprises three physiographical divisions, namely, the Brahmaputra Valley, the Barak Valley and the Karbi-Anglong and the North-Cachar hills. The Brahmaputra Valley in Assam is approximately 80 to 100 km wide and almost 1000 km long. The width of the river itself is 16 km at many places within the valley. The hills of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao district and those in and around Guwahati and North Guwahati (along with the Khasi and Garo Hills) are originally parts of the South Indian Plateau system. These are eroded and dissected by the numerous rivers in the region. The average height of these hills in Assam varies from 300m to 400m to a maximum of about 2000m almost. There are also hills in the North Bank bordering Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh as well as those near Burma. The southern so called \\"Barak-like\\" Valley is separated by the Karbi Anglong and North Cachar Hills from the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam. The Barak originates from the Barail Range in the border areas of Assam, Nagaland, and Manipur and flowing through the district of Cachar, it confluences with the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh. Barak Valley in Assam is a small valley with an average width and length of approximately 40 to 50 km. Mineral resources Assam is endowed with petroleum, natural gas, coal, limestone and many other minor minerals such as magnetic quartzite, kaolin, sillimanites, clay and feldspar. A small quantity of iron ore is also available in western parts of Assam. The Upper Assam districts are major reserves of oil and gas. Petroleum was discovered in Assam in 1889. It is estimated that Assam and surrounding region possess around 150 million tonnes of petroleum reserves. Presently, Assam is the 3rd largest producer of petroleum (crude) and natural gas in the country accounting for 16% and 8% respectively of the total production of this mineral in the country. A Tertiary coal belt is located in Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao districts with an estimated reserve of 370 million tonnes. Assam coal is friable in nature and has high sulfur content. It is mainly utilized by local railways, steamers, and hydro power stations. Low moisture, low volatile cooking coal has been discovered in the Hallidayga Singamari area. Assam has rich limestone reserves. The major reserves of limestone are in Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong districts. A total reserve of 97 million tonnes of limestone has been found in these two districts and almost half of the reserve is of cement grade. Moreover, there is an estimated reserve of 365 million tonnes of limestone near Umrangshu in Dima Hasao district. Among the minor minerals, there are quartzite reserves in the Nagaon district, kaolin reserves in Karbi Anglong and the Lakhimpur districts and sillimanite-bearing rocks in Karbi Anglong district. Climatic characteristics With the 'Tropical Monsoon Rainforest Climate', Assam is a temperate region and experiences heavy rainfall and humidity. Winter lasts from late October to late February. The minimum temperature is 6 to 8 degrees Celsius. Nights and early mornings are foggy, and rain is scanty. Summer starts in mid May, accompanied by high humidity and rainfall. The maximum temperature is 35 to 38 degrees Celsius, but the frequent rain reduces this. The peak of the monsoons is during June. Thunderstorms and frequent storms known as Bordoisila are frequent during the afternoons during the Bihu season. Biogeography and biodiversity A white-winged wood duck or deuhnah A golden langur Assam is a part of the Biodiversity Hotspot area. There are a number of tropical rainforests in Assam, including the Dehing Patkai rainforest. Moreover, there are riverine grass lands, bamboo orchards and numerous wetland ecosystems. Many of these areas have been protected by developing national parks and reserved forests. The Kaziranga and Manas are the two World Heritage Sites in the region. The Kaziranga is the home for the rare Indian rhinoceros, while Manas is a tiger sanctuary. Apart from the rhinoceros and the tiger, the spotted deer or chital / futukihorina (Axis axis), the swamp deer or dolharina (Cervus duvauceli duvauceli), the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), the hoolock gibbon or holoubandor, pygmy hog or nol-gahori (Sus salvanis), the wild buffalo, the hispid hare, the golden langur (Chloropsis cochinchinensis), the golden cat, the giant civet, the binturong, the hog badger, the civet cat and the porcupine are all found in the state. Moreover, there are abundant numbers of Gangetic dolphins, mongooses, giant squirrels and pythons. A few of the major birds in Assam are: the blue-throated barbet or hetuluka (Megalaima asiatica), the white-winged wood duck or deuhnah (Cairina scultulata), the Pallas's fish eagle or kuruwa (Haliaeetus leucoryphus), the great pied hornbill or rajdhonesh (Buceros bicornis homrai), the Himalayan golden-backed three-toed woodpecker or barhoituka (Dinopium shorii shorii), and the migratory pelican. Assam is also known for orchids and also for valuable plant species and forest products. Natural disasters The region is also prone to natural disasters. High rainfall, deforestation, and other factors which have resulted in annual floods. These often cause widespread loss of life, livelihood and property. The region is also prone to earthquake, mild tremors are common, but strong earthquakes are rare. There have been three strong earthquakes: in 1869 the bank of the Barak sank by 15 ft. In 1897 there was a tremor which measured 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale, and another in 1950 which measured 8.6.

Camp Holloway was a helicopter facility constructed by the United States Army near Pleiku in 1962. It was built to support the operations of Free World Military Forces in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam. In August 1964, the United States Navy reported they were attacked by torpedo boats of the North Vietnamese Vietnam People's Navy in what became known as the Tonkin Gulf Incident. In response to the perceived aggression of Communist forces in Southeast Asia, the United States Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution which enabled U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to deploy conventional military forces in the region to prevent further attacks by the North Vietnamese. Immediately after the Tonkin Gulf Resolution was passed, Johnson ordered the bombing of North Vietnamese Navy bases in retaliation for the reported attacks on U.S. Navy warships between 2 and 4 August 1964. However, the Viet Cong (VC) forces in South Vietnam were not deterred by the threat of U.S. retaliation. Throughout 1964, the VC launched several attacks on U.S. military facilities in South Vietnam but Johnson did not start further retaliations against North Vietnam, as he tried to avoid upsetting U.S. public opinion during the 1964 United States Presidential Election. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, were experiencing political changes of their own as Nikita Khrushchev was removed from power. As leader of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev had begun the process of disengagement from Vietnam by reducing economic and military aid to North Vietnam. However, in the aftermath of Khrushchev's downfall, the Soviet government had to redefine their role in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam, to compete with the growing influence of the People's Republic of China. In February 1965 Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin travelled to Hanoi to rebuild Soviet ties with North Vietnam, and the formation of a military alliance was on the agenda. Coincidentally, senior security adviser to the U.S. President McGeorge Bundy was also in Saigon to report on the political chaos in South Vietnam. In the shadow of those events, the VC 409th Battalion staged an attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965. This time, with his victory in the 1964 presidential election secured, Johnson decided to launch Operation Flaming Dart which entailed strikes on North Vietnamese military targets. However, with Kosygin still in Hanoi during the U.S bombing, the Soviet government decided to step up their military aid to North Vietnam, thereby signalling a major reversal of Khrushchev's policy in Vietnam. Background On 2 August 1964, while operating off the North Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of Tonkin, was engaged by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats. In the ensuing battle, a North Vietnamese torpedo boat was reported to be heavily damaged by U.S. fire, while the remaining North Vietnamese vessels were chased off by aircraft from .Jowett & O'Donnel, p. 264 On 4 August 1964, the United States Navy claimed that a second attack occurred when North Vietnamese Navy vessels fired torpedoes at USS Maddox and . In response to the second \\"unprovoked attack\\" on U.S. warships, on 7 August 1964 the United States Congress unanimously passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution which gave President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to deploy conventional U.S. military forces in Southeast Asia to \\"prevent further aggression\\" from North Vietnamese forces, without the formal declaration of war by the Congress.Jowett & O'Donnel, p. 265 Even though Johnson had been given a mandate to take military action against North Vietnam and the VC in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson was in the midst of a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their country into war.Worth, p. 30 Therefore, Johnson decided to wait until after the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.Brune, p. 743 In Moscow, between November and December 1964, at two sessions of the Presidium of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, Soviet leaders discussed the topic of Soviet military aid to North Vietnam.Khoo, p. 24 Although details of the discussions were not made public, the first indication of Soviet strategy in Vietnam came on 24 December 1964, when the Soviet government invited the North Vietnamese-backed VC to open a permanent mission in Moscow. Then on 4 February 1965 McGeorge Bundy, national security adviser to President Johnson, arrived in Saigon to meet with the then U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, General Maxwell Taylor, to discuss the political situation in the country.Van de Mark, p. 46 Two days later on 6 February 1965, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin arrived in Hanoi for a historic visit to North Vietnam, included in his entourage was a team of Soviet missile experts.Khoo, p. 25 Attack Early in 1965, as American and Soviet leaders were cementing their strategy in Vietnam, the VC 409th Battalion was ordered to begin their part of the Communist spring offensive by attacking the U.S. airfield at Camp Holloway near Pleiku in Gia Lai Province and the South Vietnamese Army base at Gia Huu in Bình Định Province.Nguyen, p. 49 Camp Holloway, which is about east of Pleiku, was opened by the U.S. Army's 81st Transportation Company in August 1962,Williams, p. 123 and the camp was subsequently named for Chief Warrant Officer Charles E. Holloway, who was killed in action in December 1962.Traas, p. 10 Towards the end of 1964, about 400 members of the U.S. Army 52nd Combat Aviation Battalion—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John C. Hughes—were deployed to Camp Holloway with the purpose of supporting South Vietnamese and other Free World Military Forces in the regions of I Corps and II Corps Tactical Zones.Dunstan, p. 33Page & Pilmott, p. 7 Nguyen Thanh Tam, commander of the VC 409th Battalion, ordered his 30th Company to leave their base area and marched into the Central Highlands, to reconnoitre and attack the U.S. airfield at Camp Holloway and the U.S. advisory compound of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam II Corps. In February 1965, Camp Holloway's outer perimeter was protected by a South Vietnamese security contingent which included one Ranger battalion, five Regional Force companies and one armored squadron.Nguyen, p. 50 However, in their reconnaissance of Camp Holloway, the VC found the security barrier which surrounded the U.S. advisory compound was the real challenge, as it was protected by several layers of concertina wire fences which measured about high. Helicopter destroyed in the attack, 7 February 1965 To overcome the U.S. defenses at Camp Holloway, Tam organized the 30th Company into two sections. The first section, under Tam's direct command, was to destroy U.S. aircraft on the airfield, and establish a route of retreat for the attack force. The second section, led by Nguyen Trong Dai, was ordered to attack the U.S. advisory compound and the facilities where U.S. pilots and technicians were housed. The 30th Company was issued with four mortars and 70 mortar shells for their attack on Camp Holloway, and were reinforced by one combat engineer platoon, a special operations platoon and a local force company of Gia Lai Province. VC combat engineers were required to break through the wire fences which protected the U.S. facility at Camp Holloway, and protect the attack forces' route of retreat using land mines. Meanwhile, the Gia Lai local force company had to set up ambush positions around the U.S. facility, to stop possible reinforcements.Nguyen, p. 51 At around 11:00pm on 6 February 1965, about 300 VV soldiers of the 30th Company assembled at their positions outside Camp Holloway,Carlisle, p. 105 where they began breaking through the wire fences. However, the VC's mission nearly turned into a disaster when their combat engineers accidentally tripped an electrical wire after breaking through the third fence barrier, but the U.S. Military Police patrolling the area did not detect it. At 1:50am on 7 February 1965, the VC attackers opened fire with their AK-47 rifles, having successfully penetrated Camp Holloway. Shortly afterwards, the VCd the airfield and the U.S. advisory compound, while the sections of the 30th Company attacked their respective targets with small arms fire. About five minutes later, the VC began retreating from the facility. Later that morning the VC claimed victory, having caused the death of eight U.S. soldiers, and another 126 wounded. In addition, ten aircraft were destroyed and 15 more were damaged.Dommen, p. 636 The VC claim to have destroyed 20 aircraft and killed over 100 Americans/South Vietnamese. Aftermath When news of the attack on Camp Holloway reached Saigon on the morning of 7 February 1965, General William Westmoreland, McGeorge Bundy and Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, flew out to Pleiku to survey the damage.Van de Mark, p. 49 Bundy then called President Johnson to put forward the MACV's request for retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam.Woods, p. 600 In response to Bundy's request, Johnson hastily convened a session of the National Security Council, which involved the speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader, to discuss the need for reprisal against the Communists in Vietnam.Woods, p. 601 That afternoon, General Nguyễn Khánh arrived in Pleiku to meet with Westmoreland and Bundy, and they both informed him that recommendations for air strikes against North Vietnam had been made to the President of the United States. Just 12 hours after the attack, Johnson started Operation Flaming Dart to bomb selected North Vietnamese targets. Accordingly, 49 U.S. fighter-bombers took off from and to attack North Vietnamese barracks in Đồng Hới, just north of the 17th Parallel.Lam, p. 135 When informed of the strikes, Khánh reportedly opened a bottle of champagne to celebrate the occasion because it served to bolster the morale of the South Vietnamese military, and showed that the U.S. was now more determined to fight North Vietnam. The VC however were not deterred by those air strikes, as they launched another attack on a U.S. installation in Qui Nhơn on 10 February 1965, which caused the death of a further 23 U.S. military personnel.Woods, p. 602Tilford, p. 68 In response, a combined force of about 160 U.S. and South Vietnamese fighter-bombers launched a larger attack against the North Vietnamese, targeting Chap Le and Chanh Hoa, also located just north of the 17th Parallel. The U.S. bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965 had a decisive impact on the Soviet Union's strategy in Vietnam. Since Ho Chi Minh and his Communist Party won control of North Vietnam in 1954, Ho's government had not always enjoyed cordial relations with their Soviet allies.Borer, p. 114 For example, in 1957 the Soviet government proposed that both North and South Vietnam be given a seat in the United Nations, a move which would have undermined the North's claim as the sole legitimate government of the whole country. Then in February 1964, North Vietnam joined the People's Republic of China in refusing to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was an insult to the policy of co-existence adopted by the then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. By that time, however, Khrushchev had already begun the process of disengagement from Vietnam because of the growing conflict in the region was becoming more expensive for the Soviet Union, with North Vietnam relying more on it for large amounts of economic and military aid.Borer, p. 115 The rift between Khrushchev's Soviet government and North Vietnam was clearly obvious in August 1964, when the Soviet Union responded in a relatively muted fashion after the U.S. conducted air strikes against North Vietnamese Navy bases in retaliation for the Tonkin Gulf incident.Borer, p. 116 Despite the Soviets' lack of response, the North Vietnamese leadership restrained itself from criticizing the Soviet government, as they were still hoping that Khrushchev would supply North Vietnam with the anti-aircraft weapons required to defend against further U.S. air attacks. However, the event which occurred in Moscow in October 1964 worked in North Vietnam's favor, as Khrushchev was removed from power. Keen to counteract Chinese influence in the region, a new Soviet government led by Alexei Kosygin sought to end a defense pact with North Vietnam. During Kosygin's stay in Hanoi, North Vietnam was subjected to U.S. air strikes which infuriated the Soviet government. Consequently, on 10 February 1965, Kosygin and his North Vietnamese counterpart, Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng, issued a joint communique which highlighted the Soviet resolve to strengthen North Vietnam's defensive potential by giving it all \\"necessary aid and support\\".Khoo, p. 28 Then in April 1965, while on a visit to Moscow, General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party Lê Duẩn signed a missile agreement with the Soviet Union, which gave the North Vietnamese military what they needed to resist Operation Rolling Thunder.

While studying, he also served as an assistant coach with the University of Massachusetts Amherst men's soccer team. =MLS= In 1996, Rammel also joined the Washington Mustangs of the USISL. On April 19, 1996, D.C. United acquired Rammel on loan from the Mustangs. They were impressed enough that they purchased his contract on May 3, 1996. He became an All Star that season, scoring 17 regular season and play off goals, including the first MLS hat trick in a May 15, 1996 victory over the Columbus Crew. His scoring touch deserted him in 1997 and after eleven games the team traded him on July 3, 1997 to the Colorado Rapids for Roy Wegerle. Rammel played the rest of the 1997 season with Colorado, never scoring a goal for the team. However, he did play 90 minutes in the championship game as the Rapids lost to United. On March 5, 1998, during the pre-season, the Rapids traded Rammel to the MetroStars for a 1999 first round supplemental draft choice. Two weeks later Rammel announced he planned to retire from playing and join UCLA as an assistant men's soccer coach. The MetroStars were allowed to keep their draft pick. Coaching Rammel had already re-entered the coaching ranks while with Colorado, becoming the Assistant Director of Coaching for the Colorado Rush youth club. However, his move to UCLA began a seven-year period where he devoted himself to coaching. Rammel was an assistant at UCLA for three years before moving to Saint Mary's College of California as the head men's soccer coach. He joined the team on March 29, 2001 and left five seasons later with a 32-54-10 record. On December 15, 2005, he left St. Mary's to become an assistant coach under Steve Sampson at the Los Angeles Galaxy. When Sampson was fired, the Galaxy purged the coaching ranks, firing Rammel in June 2006. On January 26, 2007, the Santa Rosa United youth club hired Rammel as the club's executive director.

History In the early 1990s guitarist and vocalist, Russell Smith, met drummer, Chris Webber, the two sharing a musical background in Grunge-rock. They were then joined by bassist and vocalist Daniel Bowles, who had experience in a techno style band in the UK. The trio forming, Crawlspace, which has been likened to Matchbox 20, Live, and Tonic. In mid-1998 Crawlspace released their debut EP, Afraid, which was the first release to gain national attention for the fledgling WA Label Embryo Records (then called Rocket Records/Phantom Music WA). The EP was co-produced by Ben Glatzer, who also produced their debut album. It received rave reviews from music critics and the title track was added on high rotation to Triple J, 96.1FM, HotFM, 2UNE and RTRFM and 30 other stations nationwide. The \\"Away\\" single followed closely behind in early 1999 and picked up a swag of national airplay culminating in the band being the Triple M 'Adopt a Band' for the month of May 1999. \\"Away\\" became the 9th most played rock song in Australia and reached number 17 on the ARIA national alternative charts. Crawlspace secured a publishing deal with Warner/Chappel and released their first album Motion in November, 1999. TV appearances included Channel V (live and interviews), Hey Hey It's Saturday (performing \\"Away\\" live) and Telethon. On the live front, Crawlspace promoted the album with ten trips to the east coast including tours with Grinspoon, Pacifier, Taxiride and The Whitlams, Matchbox 20, Deadstar, Primary, Cold Chisel (in front of 18,000 at the Burswood Dome) and at The Big Day Out (Perth). Crawlspace were nominated for an ARIA award for 'Best Independent Release' up against the likes of Josh Abrahams and Diana Ah Naid. In 2000 the band re-structured with Bowles shifting to guitars and keyboards and a new bassist, Travis Franklin, joining. Shortly after Webber decided to leave (subsequently joining Sleeping Giant and Full Scale Revolution) and was replaced with Travis' brother, Matt Franklin, this was followed by the departure of Bowles (later to form electronic rock act Ura and The Rube Goldberg Machine, as well as perform in David O'List's backing band) leaving Smith as the only original member remaining. The band then went into a hiatus for a year following which they started writing material for their follow-up album. Crawlspace then began pre-production on the new album From Now On in mid-2001 and the band began recording with long term collaborator Ben Glatzer (Ammonia, Cartman, The Sleepy Jackson) in early 2002. It was during this time the band contributed a song for an INXS tribute album, INXS Hometown Tribute, on the Goh International label. In late 2002 the band engaged a new guitarist, Joe Sivak. Pre-released tracks from the album received airplay on South West regional stations, which was supported by a number of regional tours. In September, 2004 Crawlspace issued their second EP, Gone To My Head, with the songs \\"Gone to My Head\\" and \\"Alright\\" receiving airplay on Triple J. 2005 saw the band second appearance on the Big Day Out tour and a publishing deal with RipTide Music in the USA, with the inclusion of the song \\"Away\\" on the Warner Bros.

Jukki Hanada is his grandson. Biography Hanada was born in Fukuoka prefecture, and was a graduate of Kyoto Imperial University. He moved to Tokyo and became a journalist for the Gunji Kogyo Shimbun, a pro-government military-industrial economic newspaper. He was initially attracted to the Japanese fascist movement promoted by Nakano Seigō. However, during World War II, he defied the Peace Preservation Laws, and published numerous essays that were highly critical of the government, and the growth of Japanese militarism in the literary magazine Bunka Soshiki, which he founded in 1939. After World War II, he contributed works to the literary magazine Kindai Bungei, and published a book of literary criticism, Fukkoku no seishin, a collection of essays on various writers, including Dante and Cervantes, in 1946. As a leading member of the Shin-Nihon Bungakukai he helped promote the works of The First Generation of Postwar Writers. He was very interested in the growth of Japanese radio drama and television, and played a role in the development of integrated audio-visual art. In politics, Hanada was a devout Marxist and active member of the Japan Communist Party, and strongly believed that art should serve politics. Hanada was a founder of Yoru no Kai (The Night Society) and a theoretical leader of avant-garde arts in Japan after World War II. He favored the avant-garde artists Okamoto Taro and Abe Kobo. He was executive adviser of Sinzenbisha, which published Abe Kobo's first novel, For the Signpost at the End of the Road, on his recommendation. Hanada developed a philosophy which he coined \\"Mineralism\\" (Kobutushugi), which combined materialism with a sense of values. Contemporaries regarded Abe as a faithful pupil of Hanada's way of thinking, and in turn, Abe was inspired by a number of Hanada's essays in his work. Hanada died of a cerebral hemorrhage, and his grave is located in Matsudo city, Chiba prefecture.

Stuart (born 1965) is an archaeologist and epigrapher specializing in the study of ancient Mesoamerica, the area now called Mexico and Central America. His work has studied all aspects of the ancient Maya civilization. He is widely recognized for his breakthroughs in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs and interpreting Maya art and iconography, starting at an early age. He is the youngest person ever to receive a MacArthur Fellowship, at age 18. He currently teaches at the University of Texas at Austin and his current research includes study of Maya, Aztec and ancient Mesoamerican images and texts. Early life He is the son of the archaeologist George E. Stuart and the writer, artist and illustrator Gene Strickland Stuart, both of whom wrote extensively for the National Geographic Society. He spent much of his childhood accompanying his parents on archaeological digs and expeditions in Mexico and Guatemala. There he developed a deep interest in Maya culture, especially their art and hieroglyphs, reading scholarly works beginning at age 10. Shortly thereafter he made original contributions to the field of decipherment and began working closely with the noted Mayanist Linda Schele. Stuart gave his first scholarly paper at the age of 12 at the 1978 Mesa Redonda de Palenque, an international conference of Mesoamerican scholars. Research Stuart is best known for his discoveries on the nature of Maya hieroglyphic writing from the 1980s to the present. By 1985 scholars had already generally recognized that there were two types of signs in the script: logograms (word signs) and syllables (consonant-vowel or CV). However, only a limited amount of Maya texts could be read in their original language, Classic Mayan, due to an imprecise understanding of the visual nature of the script, especially the ways signs formed and combined. Stuart demonstrated that signs could have a great many variants and forms, all visually distinct yet functionally equivalent. The recognition of the principles behind graphic variation and structure helped lead to a number of breakthroughs. Stuart proposed the decipherments of many new syllables and logograms in the 1980s and 1990s, which in turn provided a more firm basis for a new wave of linguistic analyses of Maya texts during the 1990s and early 2000s. Stuart has also contributed a number of studies of Maya art, history and religion, especially at the sites of Copán, Palenque, Tikal, La Corona, San Bartolo and Xultun. in the late 1990s he produced a new interpretation of the history surrounding the Teotihuacan's \\"arrival\\" to the Maya area in 378 CE, proposing this was a military overthrow of the local Tikal king, and the establishment of a new political order. Much of Stuart's work focused on the field documentation of Maya sculpture and inscriptions at numerous sites, through epigraphic drawing and photography. He remains actively engaged as a member of several ongoing excavation projects in Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. Recently Stuart has developed new research in the iconography and script of central Mexico, especially among the Mexica. In 2018 he presented a new and controversial interpretation of the so-called Calendar Stone of Tenochtitlan, suggesting it is not an image of an Aztec deity, but rather a deified portrait of the emperor Moctezuma II as the sun. Stuart emphasizes its role as a political monument and image, the purpose of which was to depict the Tenochca ruler at the center of the cosmos. Career Stuart's early work on the decipherment of Maya writing led to a MacArthur Fellowship in 1984. He is the youngest-ever recipient of that award. Stuart continues to make major contributions in the field of epigraphy, particularly related to the decipherment of the Maya script used by the pre-Columbian Maya civilization of Mesoamerica. See for example Coe (1992), p. 231 et seq. His insights into the structure and content of Maya hieroglyphic writing was highlighted in the award-winning documentary film \\"Breaking the Maya Code\\" (Night Fire Films, 2008). After completing his B.A. in Art and Archaeology at Princeton University in 1989, Stuart received his Ph.D in Anthropology from Vanderbilt University in 1995. At that time he was appointed the Bartlett Curator of Maya Hieroglyphs at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, and was a senior lecturer at Harvard's Department of Anthropology before beginning at the University of Texas at Austin in 2004. His many publications include Ten Phonetic Syllables (1987), which laid much of the groundwork for the now- accepted methodology of Maya hieroglyphic decipherment. In 2003 he published a volume in the ongoing Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions series (Peabody Museum, Harvard University), devoted to drawings and photographs of sculpture from Piedras Negras, Guatemala. He co-authored Palenque: Eternal City of the Maya (Thames and Hudson, 2008) with his father, George Stuart. His book The Order of Days (Random House, 2011) explored the important role of time and cosmology in Classic Maya civilization, while also debunking the 2012 phenomenon claim that the Maya viewed 2012 as the end of their elaborate calendar. At present he is working on a new book which will offer a detailed analysis of the three temples of the Cross Group complex at Palenque. Stuart is currently the director of The Mesoamerica Center at The University of Texas at Austin, which fosters multi-disciplinary studies on ancient American art and culture. He also oversees the activities of the Casa Herrera, UT's academic research center in Antigua, Guatemala, devoted to studies in the art, archaeology and culture of wider Mesoamerica.

According to one report, the theatre \\"had a gallery and pit, but no boxes, except one on the stage for the then Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Earl of Strafford.\\"Christopher Morash, A History of Irish Theatre, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002; p. 5. Ogilby had come to Ireland in Strafford's entourage, and Strafford, who was fond of the theatre, gave him every encouragement. John Aubrey termed it \\"a pretty little theatre.\\" No trace of it survives, but it was located on Werburgh Street near Dublin Castle. Associations The playhouse was closely associated, during its short lifetime, with James Shirley, the prominent London dramatist who spent the years 1637-40 in Dublin. (Shirley left London when the theatres closed due to a severe outbreak of bubonic plague, from May 1636 to October 1637.) Shirley wrote four plays for the theatre, The Royal Master, The Doubtful Heir, The Constant Maid, and St. Patrick for Ireland; the first of these plays premiered on 1 January 1638, the last was performed in the autumn of 1639. During the same period, the theatre also performed Jonson's The Alchemist, Middleton's No Wit, No Help Like a Woman's, two plays from the John Fletcher canon, and anonymous plays titled The General and The Toy -- even a play by Ogilby, The London Merchant. The earliest published play by a native Irish author, Henry Burnell's Landgartha, was acted at the theatre on 17 March 1640. Shirley wrote Prologues to all of these works.Samuel Carlyle Hughes, The Pre-Victorian Drama in Dublin, New York, Burt Franklin; reprinted Ayer Publishing, 1970; p. 2. Shirley may also have brought some London actors with him to Dublin. Shirley had functioned as the house dramatist for Queen Henrietta's Men, but the plague crisis of 1636-37 had disrupted that company. Four veterans of the troupe -- William Allen, Michael Bowyer, Hugh Clark, and William Robbins -- disappeared from the London theatre scene for the time that Shirley was in Dublin; they reappeared at the end of the Dublin venture in 1640, when all four joined the King's Men. The years of the Werburgh fill the holes in the four actors' careers.Allan H. Stevenson, \\"James Shirley and the Actors at the First Irish Theatre,\\" Modern Philology, Vol. 40 No. 2 (November 1942), pp. 147-60. Closure \\"The Theatre came to a sudden end with the outbreak of the rebellion in 1641. In October the Lords Justices prohibited playing there; and shortly after, we are told, the building was 'ruined and spoiled, and a cow- house made of the stage.'\\"Joseph Quincy Adams, quoting a contemporary manuscript source, in Shakespearean Playhouses: A History of English Theatres from the Beginnings to the Restoration, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1917; p. 419. (Shirley had sailed for England on 18 April 1640.) Three and a half centuries later, the site of the former theatre was the yard of Kerfoot's Dining Rooms at 13 Werburgh St., Dublin.

They can play both sides and influence voters for the highest bidder.

The \\"Power Broker\\" concept was devised by Mark Gruenwald as a satire on the public obsession with health and fitness. Publication history The Curtiss Jackson version of Power Broker first appeared in Machine Man #6 (September 1978) and was created by Roger Stern and Sal Buscema. The second Power Broker first appeared in Avengers: The Initiative Annual #1 (January 2008) and was created by Dan Slott and Christos N. Gage. Fictional character biography =Curtiss Jackson= Curtiss Jackson was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. He became a professional criminal and an executive with the criminal organization known as the Corporation. As a member of the Corporation, Jackson attempts to take control of Machine Man.Machine Man #6. Marvel Comics. With Eugene Stivak, Moonstone, and the Vamp, he later battles Captain America, Marvel Man, the Falcon, and the Hulk.Captain America #230; Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #232–233. Marvel Comics. Jackson kidnaps Trish Starr, and battles the Hulk and Machine Man again.Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #234–237. Marvel Comics. Jackson founds the Power Broker Corporation. He hires Dr. Karl Malus, a mad scientist who has experimented on various superhuman individuals, to technologically augment the strength of paying customers to superhuman levels. The strength augmenting process is tremendously risky, with half the subjects dying or becoming severely deformed, but this information is kept a closely guarded secret. Power Broker and Malus use highly addictive drugs on their subjects, telling them that the chemical is necessary to stabilize their powers, but in fact it only serves to keep the subjects working for—and paying—the Power Broker. Many wrestlers of the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation, which is only open to those with super-strength, use the Power Broker's services, and wind up indebted to them. The Power Broker offers Sharon Ventura superhuman strength. She is reportedly sexually abused while drugged. She breaks free before Malus can administer the addictive drug, so the Power Broker sends the Grapplers to kill her.Thing #35. Marvel Comics. The Power Broker later kidnaps Demolition- Man, and battles Captain America and the Shroud when they come to rescue him.Captain America #329–331. Marvel Comics. When Power Broker, Inc. is attacked by the Scourge of the Underworld, Curtiss Jackson exposes himself to his own augmentation device. The process goes awry, leaving him so grotesquely muscle-bound that he cannot move.Captain America #358–362. Marvel Comics. Jackson was revealed to be a patient at Los Angeles County Hospital. Malus decided to take advantage of this situation by sending Vagabond, who knew Jackson (having previously approached him about gaining super-strength herself), to obtain a copy of his fingerprints so that Malus could access all of Jackson's personal accounts and vaults. He used an explosive wristband to force Vagabond's cooperation, but she managed to knock Malus out, destroy the fingerprint mold, place the band on his wrist, and inject him with the drug he had planned to use on her.Captain America #363–364. Marvel Comics. The Power Broker had Malus' legs broken for his betrayal, then promptly re-hired him to try to cure Jackson's condition. Malus captured and experimented on several augmented individuals, including Battlestar to perfect the de-augmentation process, which drew the involvement of the U.S. Agent. Jackson appeared, revealed to be using an exo-skeleton to move. Together, Battlestar and the Agent defeated Jackson and freed the captured wrestlers, and forced Malus to restore their strength. The U.S. Agent then destroyed Malus' equipment and records, leaving Jackson in an over-augmented state.Captain America #375–378. Marvel Comics. Power Broker has been responsible for providing augmented henchmen to various criminal organizations, such as the Sweatshop, and the Power Tools. The Power Broker was later revealed as one of the Red Skull's division chiefs.Captain America #394. Marvel Comics. Jackson resurfaced following the Maximum Security storyline, when Earth was made into an intergalactic penal colony. His extra-muscular bulk had been shed in-between appearances leaving him looking normal once again. Seeing an opportunity to recruit many of the exotic prisoners being dumped by the Kree and other alien races, Jackson raced to an area his computers determined would have a large amount of arrivals. Unfortunately for Jackson, the aliens were less than pleased at having been dumped on Earth, and attacked him. Playing dead, Jackson came upon a parasitic organism (Jackson calls it an alien, but U.S. Agent believed it to be an escaped S.H.I.E.L.D. experiment to control the alien criminals) who had lost its host. In exchange for becoming its host, Jackson would be granted the use of the parasite's spawn to infect and control others. In his plan to take over the world, Jackson smuggled the parasite spawns to a HYDRA base and a rebel Atlantean group. These operations were broken up by S.T.A.R.S. and their main agent, U.S. Agent, leading the group to take down the Power Broker once again.U.S. Agent #1–3. Marvel Comics. Punisher later kills and impersonates Jackson in order to infiltrate a supervillain auction being held on Long Island. =Successor= Very little is known about this Power Broker other than he wears a battle suit, and can project bolts of energy from his hands. This new Power Broker has apparently taken over Power Broker, Inc. He was responsible for giving Paul Brokeridge super-strength to wrestle in the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation, a move that led to Paul attaining the championship and later being crippled by a stronger wrestler. He was also responsible for giving Paul's brother Roger superpowers where Roger later became the superhero Hardball.Avengers: The Initiative Annual #1. Marvel Comics. Power Broker proceeds to invest in Hench, a mobile app that allows people to quickly hire supervillains. He demonstrates his invention to Darren Cross by enlisting Whirlwind to kill Cross' nemesis Ant-Man. When Cross refuses to invest at least 1.2 billion dollars in Hench, Power Broker ends the demo, and cancels Whirlwind's attempted assassination of Ant-Man.Astonishing Ant-Man #1. Marvel Comics. A publicist named Marlena Howard later uses Hench to hire the Magician's son to stage an attack on Darla Deering.Astonishing Ant-Man #2. Marvel Comics. Cross's unwillingness to invest in the Hench App spurs his son Augustine into hiring Machinesmith to hack into Power Broker Inc.'s databases so that Cross Technological Enterprises can steal the Hench algorithm and use it to create a knock-off called \\"Lackey.\\" During a meeting with Slug, who had used Hench to hire the new Hijacker to steal a Giganto egg, Power Broker is made aware of Cross's treachery, which enrages him to the point of ordering the premature release of \\"Hench 2.0\\".Astonishing Ant-Man #3. Marvel Comics. Power Broker later held an event to promote the new Hench 2.0 upgrade. In order to protect the unveiling, he used the Hench App to hire a female Blacklash.Astonishing Ant-Man #5. Marvel Comics. Cassandra Lang attempts to get abilities from Power Broker II with the intention of double- crossing him. However, Power Broker II realizes that she does not have what it takes to be a villain. Instead, Power Broker II tells her about Darren Cross having stolen her heart and that her father hid it from her. As Darren Cross had stolen something from him, he makes a deal with her....he will give her powers to do with as she wants. In exchange, she must retrieve the item that Darren took from him and in the process get her revenge on him. She chooses to have her old powers back because she does not want to learn a new power set. Cassandra Lang is given a new suit and a helmet similar to her father's while sporting the new name of Stinger.Astonishing Ant-Man #6. Marvel Comics. At a public event, Power Broker revealed the Hench X app that enables anyone to become a supervillain. He tests it out on a former comic store clerk named Paul who ends up becoming the second Plantman who was then unleashed when Ant- Man showed up to interrogate Power Broker on personal matters.Astonishing Ant- Man #7. Marvel Comics. Some time later, Power Broker ran out of funding for his Hench app and fled to his secret island where he started to work on an app for supervillain travel booking. Unfortunately, his investors turned down the idea. Upon tracking down Power Broker, Stinger subdued him.Astonishing Ant-Man #11. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Curtiss Jackson version of Power Broker was an ordinary man until he exposed himself to his own chemical and radiation strength augmentation process. This granted him superhuman strength and durability, but left him with a grotesquely overdeveloped muscular physique which renders him unable to move without artificial aids. Dr. Karl Malus invented a powerful steel alloy exo-skeleton with tongue controls and flight capabilities to enable the Power Broker to move. Jackson has managed to de-augment himself and no longer uses the exo-skeleton. Jackson was briefly the host to a parasitic organism. This allowed him to mind-control anyone infected with the organism's spawn. Jackson has a college degree in business administration, and is a highly skilled administrator and planner. The second Power Broker wears a battlesuit and can project bolts of energy from his hands. Power Broker Inc.

Musical debut Du Bois began to learn music when he was 8 years old. By the age of 17, he had already become a professional. At 16 years old, François Du Bois embarked upon a career path as a symphonic orchestra percussionist and a jazz drummer, which he pursued until he was 26. In the classical field, he has worked with Lorin Maazel, Olivier Messiaen, and Mstislav Rostropovich, and in the field of jazz, he has worked with Richard Galliano, Trilok Gurtu, Dominique Di Piazza, and Abbey Lincoln. =A detour= Dissatisfied with the lack of artistic substance in his music, Du Bois left France at the age of 20 for Africa, in search of experience and inspiration that would lend his music greater substance, a journey that led him to Burkina Faso. During his first year there, Du Bois caught malaria, but he fully recovered. Several years later, Du Bois' musical education had become complete after having studied under his mentor, Ray Lema.Batteur Magazine 88, Mars 96 Lema is an African singer and composer who founded the National Ballet of Zaire (today Democratic Republic of the Congo).

In 1998, Du Bois left Paris for Tokyo on a quest to discover new horizons in the field of music. Keio University invited Du Bois to create a special class in musical composition for the Political Science department. That same year, he created the “Orchestre d’autre part”, an ensemble that consisted of 14 marimbists and taiko players. Keiko Abe, a key person in the development of the marimba, introduced Du Bois to two of her former students with whom he would record the album “Origine”. Soon after the album's release, NHK broadcast a live 30-minute programme “Studio Park: François Du Bois Special” that reached 10 million viewers during primetime. In 2013, François Du Bois composed a double album, recorded in October of that year at the Meguro Fudoson Buddhist temple, accompanied by the temple monks. Out of their collaboration arose a new sound to stimulate meditation. The music was inspired by the Chinese concepts of “Liu Zi Jue” and “Medita Music”.Yuhobika, April 2015, p. 145, 146, 150.

Filming took place in Sierra de Órganos National Park in the town of Sombrerete, Mexico. Teo brief scenes take place in the square that is used for the final shootout in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Plot After the death of her husband, Mrs. Lowe (Ann-Margret) wants to tell the railroad where to find the half-million U.S. dollars in gold her late husband, Matt, stole during a train robbery, and clear the family name for her son. Instead Lane (John Wayne) convinces her to retrieve the gold so she can collect the $50,000 reward offered by the railroad for its return. Lane lines up some old friends to assist him in retrieving the gold for a share of the reward. But the other original train robbers have gathered a gang and will try to get the gold at any cost. As they all journey into Mexico in search of the hidden gold they are followed closely by an unnamed Pinkerton agent (Ricardo Montalban) who is working for Wells Fargo. After a series of adventures and battles they return to Texas with the gold where there is one final battle. The next day Lane and his men put Mrs. Lowe on a train to return the gold and tell her she can keep the reward for herself and her son. As they are walking past the end of the train they meet the Pinkerton Agent who tells them, as the train is pulling out, that Matt Lowe was never married and that Mrs. Lowe is really a prostitute named Lilly who fooled them into helping her get the gold for herself. Lane then leads his gang to rob the train as the film ends.

But what’s best about it, what makes it worth seeing, is Kennedy’s visual approach to the subject of John Wayne.\\" Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote, \\"I don't think that tone and attitude are quite enough to sustain a movie, or that an air of good feeling can take the place of meaningful dramatic action. But as an exercise in pleasantness, 'The Train Robbers' is an interesting addition to the late history of the traditional unpretentious Western.\\"Greenspun, Roger (February 8, 1973). \\"Screen: 'Train Robbers'\\".

(This is the medieval Gaelic version of his name; in modern Gaelic he would be \\"Máel Coluim mac Alasdair\\", and in English he would be \\"Malcolm son of Alexander\\".) He is a relatively obscure figure owing primarily to the scarcity of source material, appearing only in pro-David English sources, which label him a \\"bastard\\". When Alexander I died in 1124, Máel Coluim's uncle David I came to the throne with the help of King Henry I of England and David's own Norman retainers. Orderic Vitalis reports that Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair \\"affected to snatch the kingdom from [David], and fought against him two sufficiently fierce battles; but David, who was loftier in understanding and in power and wealth, conquered him and his followers\\".A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 158. Máel Coluim's war against David and Henry may have involved the death of David's eldest son. Before recounting the war against Máel Coluim, Orderic Vitalis reported the death of this son at the hands of an exiled Norwegian priest; but Orderic's account is so obscure that it is difficult to make anything of it. The priest was reportedly a member of David's household, and was put to death by being bound to the tails of four horses.A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 157; Duncan, The Kingship of the Scots, p 59, doubts the existence of this son on the basis that David is not known to have commemorated this supposed child, as he did to his other dead relatives. Whether or not the two events were connected, Máel Coluim escaped unharmed into areas of Scotland not yet under David's control, and there gained shelter and some measure of support; when Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair renewed his claim to the throne six years later, he had the support and protection of the king of Moray.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 84-5. In 1130, Máel Coluim enters the scant sources once more. Máel Coluim now had the backing of Óengus of Moray. King Óengus was David's most powerful \\"vassal\\", a man who, as grandson of King Lulach of Scotland, even had his own claim to the kingdom. Máel Coluim and Óengus' forces had advanced into Angus when they were met by David's Mercian constable, Edward; the ensuing Battle of Stracathro took place near Brechin. According to the Annals of Ulster, 1000 of Edward's army, and 4000 of Óengus' army, including Óengus himself,Annals of Ulster, s.a. U1130.4, here (trans) died. According to Orderic Vitalis, Edward followed up the killing of Óengus by marching north into Moray itself, which, in his words, \\"lacked a defender and lord\\"; and so Edward, \\"with God's help obtained the entire duchy of that extensive district\\".A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 167; Anderson uses the word \\"earldom\\", but Orderic in fact used the word ducatum, duchy. However, this was far from the end of it. Máel Coluim again escaped, and four years of this continuing Scottish \\"civil war\\" followed; for David this period was quite simply a \\"struggle for survival\\".Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 88. It appears that David applied for and obtained extensive military aid from his patron, King Henry. Ailred of Rievaulx relates that at this point a large fleet and a large army of Norman knights, including Walter l'Espec, and were sent by Henry to Carlisle to assist in David's attempt to root out his Scottish enemies.A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 193-4; see also Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 86. The fleet seems to have been used in the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde and the entire Argyll coast, where Máel Coluim was probably at large among supporters. By 1134 Máel Coluim was captured and imprisoned in Roxburgh Castle.A.O. Anderson, Early Sources, vol. ii, p. 183. Máel Coluim's eventual fate is unknown. He was, and to a large extent still is, confused with Máel Coluim mac Áeda, son of Áed, later Mormaer of Ross.

The New Zealand government launched Bonus Bonds under the Unit Trusts Act 1960 through the Post Office Savings Bank with the goal of encouraging New Zealanders to save money. It is the country's largest retail unit trust, with around one third of New Zealanders owning bonds.  Management  the ANZ manages the trust (ANZ acquired PostBank (Post Office Bank Ltd) from the government in 1988). Trustees Executors Limited acts as a trustee for bondholders. Potential customers can purchase bonds from any ANZ branch or from any PostShop. Management invests trust funds in \\"safe\\" assets such as corporate securities, government bonds and securities issued by banks.  Prizes  Electronic Selective indicator equipment (ELSIE) was the machine that first selected Bonus Bonds in the 1970s. Each month the trust pays out a total of NZ$7.9 million, consisting of 248,000 random tax-paid cash prizes, based on the amount invested, with three top prizes: 1 of $1,000,000, 1 of $100,000 and 1 of $50,000. In order to participate in a draw, investors must purchase a minimum $20 in bonds, and must have held them for a full calendar month. The chances of winning do not exceed 1 in 9,600 per unit - as required by the Finance Act (No 2) 1990. the chance of each unit winning a prize ranged from 1 in 9,600 and 1 in 11,000. In 2015 the odds of winner per unit increased to range from between 1 in 14,000 and 1 in 20,000. A single bonus bond or unit translates to one dollar, and each unit owned has a chance of winning. The average win is apparently around $27.50, giving a tax-free return of around 3.4% . Returns will vary based on security returns, and these are of course averaged figures which will vary greatly due to the random nature of the investment. Mary Holm in The New Zealand Herald describes Bonus Bonds thus: \\"As I've said before, having a bit in bonus bonds is fine if you regard it as fun. But it is not the place for major savings\\". New Zealand personal finance website moneyhub reported in a study that 99.996% of bonus bonds return $0 to their owners in a typical monthly draw.\\"Bonus Bonds - are they worth your money?\\" moneyhub.co.nz, November 30, 2017 To conduct the draw the Bonus Bonds trust uses a random number generator called ELSIE (Electronic Selection Indicator Equipment), based in the Bonus Bonds Transaction Centre in central Dunedin.  Marketing  Comedian Leigh Hart ('That Guy') promoted Bonus Bonds in a television advertisement, presenting the bonds as an exciting way to invest, with the catchphrase \\"the money and the bag\\" (referring to It's in the Bag, a long- running New Zealand radio and television game show). Winding up of scheme In August 2020, ANZ announced that the Bonus Bonds scheme would be wound up in October 2020, stating that \\"low interest rates had reduced the investment returns of the scheme affecting the size of its prize pool\\".

A Pennsylvania native and veteran of the War of 1812, he also participated in the early movements to form a government in Oregon Country and founded Linn City, Oregon. Before traveling to Oregon in 1840 he had served in the Missouri General Assembly. Early life Robert Moore was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, on October 2, 1781.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 169. In 1805, Moore married Margaret Clark, and they would have ten children. In the east he served as a soldier in the War of 1812 before moving to the Midwest where he helped to found several towns and built several businesses. The Moores would move to Illinois where Robert left the family to immigrate to Oregon Country. Margaret would die in 1848 in Missouri. Oregon Robert Moore traveled to Oregon over the Oregon Trail in 1839. He started out with the Farnham party from Peoria, Illinois, known as the Peoria Party. Moore joined the Shortess party briefly after the Peoria Party split at Bent’s Fort. He arrived in Oregon 1840 at Willamette Falls. Three of his ten children also immigrated west. In 1840, after arriving, Moore began building Robin’s Nest across the river from Oregon City. He purchased the from a local Native American chief named Wanaxha. The town was later renamed Linn City in honor of Missouri Senator Lewis Linn who sponsored the Donation Land Claim Act. By 1845, Moore was also operating a ferry across the Willamette River to Oregon City.

Retrieved on March 18, 2008. In Oregon on February 18, 1841, Moore was selected to a constitutional committee by fellow pioneers in an early and failed attempt at forming a provisional government. Though a constitution was never adopted, Dr. Ira L. Babcock was selected to serve as a supreme judge with probate powers to deal with the estate of prominent pioneer Ewing Young, while Moore was chosen as a justice of the peace. Then at the July 5, 1843, Champoeg Meeting Moore participated and voted in favor of forming a provisional government. The proposal passed 52 to 50, leading to the creation of the Provisional Government.

Also in 1850, Moore became the postmaster for the community.History of West Linn. City of West Linn. Retrieved on March 18, 2008. He also advocated for the property rights of Dr. John McLoughlin, whose land holdings in Oregon City were denied in the Donation Land Act of 1850. Moore remarried in 1851 to Jane Gilbert Tubbs Apperson. In 1854, a fire destroyed much of Linn City, so the business district was relocated to the west and the city became West Linn.

Chemistry Desoxypipradrol is closely related on a structural level to the compounds methylphenidate and pipradrol, all three of which share a similar pharmacological action. Of these three piperidines, desoxypipradrol has the longest elimination half-life, as it is a highly lipophilic molecule lacking polar functional groups that are typically targeted by metabolic enzymes, giving it an extremely long duration of action when compared to most psychostimulants. Methylphenidate, on the other hand, is a short-acting compound, as it possesses a methyl-ester moiety that is easily cleaved, forming a highly polar acid group, while pipradrol is intermediate in duration, possessing a hydroxyl group which can be conjugated (e.g. with glucuronide) to increase its hydrophilicity and facilitate excretion, but no easily metabolized groups. History Desoxypipradrol was developed by the pharmaceutical company CIBA (now called Novartis) in the 1950s, and researched for applications such as the treatment of narcolepsy and ADHD; however, it was dropped from development after the related drug methylphenidate was developed by the same company. Methylphenidate was felt to be the superior drug for treating ADHD due to its shorter duration of action and more predictable pharmacokinetics, and while desoxypipradrol was researched for other applications (such as facilitation of rapid recovery from anaesthesia), its development was not continued. The hydroxylated derivative pipradrol was, however, introduced as a clinical drug indicated for depression, narcolepsy and cognitive enhancement in organic dementia.  Detection in biological specimens  Desoxypipradrol may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma desoxypipradrol concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/L in intoxicated patients and >600 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Legal status Desoxypipradrol's structural similarity to pipradrol makes it possible that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue in several countries such as Australia and New Zealand. =China= As of October 2015 2-DPMP is a controlled substance in China. =United Kingdom= As of 4 November 2010, the UK Home Office announced a ban on the importation of 2-DPMP, following a recommendation from the ACMD.Import ban on psychoactive drug UK Home Office Prior to the import ban, desoxypipradrol was sold as a 'legal high' in several products, most notably \\"Ivory wave\\". Its use lead to several Emergency Department visits which prompted the UK government to commission a review from the ACMD. One man had ingested nearly 1 gram of the drug which may have been fatal without sedation with an anaesthetic dose of a benzodiazepine administered in accident and emergency. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs stated in their report that: :\\"there are serious harms associated with 2-DPMP... typically prolonged agitation (lasting up to 5 days after drug use which is sometimes severe, requiring physical restraint), paranoia, hallucinations and myoclonus (muscle spasms/twitches).\\" 2-DPMP was due to become a class B drug on 28 March 2012, but the bill was scrapped as two steroids deemed not to be abusable were included in the bill but were later recommended to remain uncontrolled. There was a new discussion about its fate on April 23, 2012, where it was decided that the bill would be rewritten and 2-DPMP would still be banned. It was also decided that the bill would be a blanket ban of related chemicals. Desoxypipradrol was eventually made a class B drug and placed in Schedule I on 13 June 2012. There were no recorded deaths from the drug between the banning of its import and the banning of its possession. \\"Esters and ethers of pipradrol\\" were controlled with the same amendment as class C drugs.

In horse tack, a panic snap is a mechanism often used between a lead and a horse harness or halter. They are useful because, unlike swivels or carabiners and similar fittings, they can be disconnected under load, as the panic snap is specially built so that the latching mechanism is separate from the load-bearing structure. They are sometimes dangerous, however, because leads or ropes under load can flail when freed. Panic snaps also find some use in suspension situations involving relatively light weights. Heavier masses are unsafe with most panic snaps because of the possibility of injury from flailing cordage. They will usually require the services of a millwright. In BDSM and bondage panic snaps are used to secure bottoms in a safe way. They allow for a single hand to be used to release a bottom in an emergency. In some cases the panic snaps can be placed within reach of the bottom's hand in case the top should have an emergency, although this is not typical. In both cases, there is a potential risk if the release of the panic snaps allows the bottom to fall while unsupported.

Landry was married twice: to Marie-Anne- Antoinette-Wilhelmine Couture in 1868 and to Amélie Dionne, the widow of Édouard Taschereau and daughter of Élisée Dionne, a member of the Quebec legislative council, in 1908. Landry also pursued a military career and rose to the position of Lieutenant Colonel of the 61st Regiment of Montmagny on January 9, 1885. He commanded the 10th Infantry Brigade during the Fenian Raids and was awarded a medal for his conduct. He served as aide de camp to Lord Stanley of Preston and to Lord Aberdeen, was colonel of the 61st Regiment in 1903 and was the regiment's Honorary Colonel in 1909. He won a seat in the Quebec Legislative Assembly in 1875 but the election was overturned a year later. He served as president of the Conservative Party Association of Quebec for several years and was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1878 as a Conservative representing Montmagny, Quebec. He was re-elected in the 1882 election but was defeated in 1887. In 1892 he was summoned to the Senate of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and sat as a Conservative. He also served as Mayor of Limoilou in 1899. After the 1911 federal election brought the Conservatives into power after a fifteen-year absence, the new prime minister, Robert Laird Borden, appointed Landry to be Speaker of the Senate. Landry was a prolific author and editor who wrote a number of books on matters of public policy in addition to his writings on agriculture. He was particularly concerned with the rights of French Canadians living outside of Quebec, particularly Franco-Manitobans and Franco-Ontarians and their rights in regards to the Manitoba Schools Question and a similar debate on publicly funded francophone schools in Ontario.Bibliography for Auguste Landry , Parliament of Canada website His interests in these questions made him a controversial figure as Speaker when the Senate was considering the issue of francophone schools in Ontario in the wake of the provincial Conservative government's passage of Regulation 17 which restricted French-language instruction. Landry felt passionately about the issue and accepted a position as President of the Franco-Ontarian Association d'éducation while he was Speaker. Many of Landry's rulings were challenged on the floor of the Senate with several being put to a vote in a departure from the normal practice of accepting a Speaker's ruling as final. In the face of his diminished authority over the upper house and the fact that many of his rulings were being overturned, he absented himself from the Chair for several days which resulted in calls for the government to dismiss him if he did not resume the Chair. Upon his return, explained that he had absented himself due to the opposition by a number of government members to his rulings and the lack of support he enjoyed. Landry continued as Speaker for a further year before resigning. He remained a Senator until his death three years later in Quebec City and devoted much of his time writing and campaigning on the issue of French-language rights in Ontario.

The $1,500 building served nine horse stalls and may have served cows as well. It was named after Eaton's young grandson Ron George.

The black-and-white film was released by Warner Bros. with an aspect ratio of 1.37:1. Plot Small, obscure St. Anthony's College, a Catholic university, is in financial straits and about to be closed. To save it, and himself from forced retirement, elderly rector Father Burke (Charles Coburn) hires a down-and-out former big-time football coach, Steve Williams (John Wayne), in hopes of building a lucrative sports program. First turning down the job, Williams later accepts it when he learns that his former wife, Anne (Marie Windsor), now remarried, complained to Social Services that he is an unfit father and plans to sue for custody of his 11-year-old daughter, Carole (Sherry Jackson). Anne’s actual aim is not to get Carole, in whom she has no interest, but rather to pressure Steve into having an affair with her. Social Services worker Alice Singleton (Donna Reed), coldly prejudiced against Steve because she suffered from a relationship with her father similar to that between Steve and Carole, is preparing a report in Anne’s favor. Steve attempts to charm Alice and win her over. Desperate to have the football program pay off, Father Burke uses his clerical connections to schedule St. Anthony's against high profile Catholic colleges — Villanova, Notre Dame, etc. — in the upcoming season. Faced with physically inadequate players, Steve uses chicanery to enroll beefy star athletes as freshmen and build a winning team. Father Burke learns of Steve’s dishonest methods, reprimands him and disbands the sports program, knowing this will cause St. Anthony’s to close. Alice submits a report unfavorable to Steve, but she repudiates it in the court custody hearing after recognizing her bias and Anne's lack of honest affection for Carole. Alice also testifies that Steve isn't a properly responsible parent, and under questioning reveals she is in love with him. The judge halts proceedings and places Carole in custody of the State. He assigns her a new case worker until matters can be sorted out. In a surprise move, the Church agrees to continue funding St. Anthony's. Burke nevertheless resigns as rector, believing that he had been behaving selfishly to unnecessarily prolong his position. Before leaving, he reinstates Steve as coach and forgives him his unscrupulous behavior as it was done out of love for his child. The film ends with Carole, accompanied by Alice, walking away from Steve, with the implication that Steve and Alice will wed and the three would be together as a family.

Hasan Nasir was born in Hyderabad (Deccan) and had fought, along with Makhdoom Mohiuddin and others, in the Telangana Peasants’ Revolt against the Razakars.  Early life  Nasir was a maternal grandson of Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk, one of the founders of the All-India Muslim League. After completing college, he was admitted into the University of Cambridge in England where he came into contact with various Marxist ideologues and soon became inspired by the rhetoric he heard. Upon his return to India, he joined forces with the oppressed Hindu peasants of Telangana and took part in anti-colonial uprisings to the chagrin of his bourgeoisie family. In the aftermath of the Partition of India and the Liberation of Hyderabad from the rule of the Nizam by Indian forces, the communist movement in Telangana collapsed and a temporary military administration was instituted in the region which subdued the collectivized communes established by the peasant rebels. The Indian Army soon pursued the remaining communist guerrilla factions in the countryside, which prompted Nasir to migrate to Pakistan in 1947. Upon arrival in Karachi in 1950, he resumed his political activities and soon became one of the most dreaded communists in the new nation to the ruling elite of right-wing Islamists. Thus, despite being the scion of an aristocratic family in Hyderabad (Deccan), he had taken up the cause of the oppressed. He was a popular left-wing activist among students, peasants, and laborers. In 1954, he was arrested by the government, imprisoned, tortured and then forcibly flown back to India. But only a year later, he escaped Indian custody and returned again to Pakistan. Nasir's reconnection with Indian communists further radicalized his ideology and hardened him as a person, and he began serving as the office secretary of the National Awami Party (NAP) after his arrival back to Karachi.  Death  In 1960, he was arrested in Karachi and put in a cell in the Lahore Fort and brutally tortured till he passed away. He died while under interrogation in Lahore Fort, a detention centre established by the Martial- Law regime of Ayub Khan. After his murder his mangled body was hastily buried by the police. The reports of torture were frightening and succeeded in halting the protests for several months. There was such a fervor over his martyrdom that the President Ayub Khan government had to exhume his body to attempt to prove to the prosecution point that he had committed suicide and was not tortured. The reason was that the government did not want to let remain anything reminding the people of Hassan Nasir. Today, there remains nothing of that cell, where he was killed, except a wall containing a small window. Hassan Nasir was brought to Lahore Fort's cell on 13 September 1960. On 13 November, at 12:40 pm, the Assistant Deputy Inspector General of the Criminal Investigation Department received a call from the line officer at the Lahore Fort that Hassan Nasir was found hanging in cell number 13 at 11:00 am that morning. On 4 December 1960, Hasan Nasir’s mother, Zahra Alamdar Hussein, arrived in Lahore from her home in Hyderabad, India. She witnessed the exhumation of the body in the Miani Sahib Graveyard on 12 December 1960 for the possession. The body suffered an advanced stage of decomposition and thus not identifiable. Mrs. Hussein issued a statement at the court that she did not think the body was that of Hasan Nasir’s and refused to take the possession. The Anarkali Police later reburied the body into an unknown grave. References in literature and popular culture * Sibte Hassan in his book Sher-e-Nigaran briefly discussed Hasan Nasir * Maj.

It was directed by John Farrow from a screenplay by James Warner Bellah and John Twist based on the novel of the same name by Andrew Geer. The plot is a nautical cat and mouse adventure, with Wayne determined to get his freighter home to Germany during the opening months of World War II, chased relentlessly across the Pacific then Atlantic oceans by Australian then British navies. The film was shot in CinemaScope and WarnerColor. Plot Captain Karl Ehrlich (John Wayne) is the master of the aging German steam freighter Ergenstrasse, home port Hamburg, docked at Sydney, Australia, on the eve of the Second World War. Ehrlich is a former German Navy officer who lost his command after refusing to support the Nazi regime. As his ship prepares for sea to avoid internment, Erlich meets with an old friend, British Royal Navy Commander Jeff Napier (David Farrar), plus Napier's German fiancée Elsa Keller (Lana Turner). Ehrlich knows Elsa has a dubious past and tries to break them up. With war imminent because Germany has invaded Poland, the Ergenstrasse prepares to slip away. The German Consul-General asks Ehrlich to transport a spy who risks capture. It is only leaving Sydney, in thick fog during night, that Ehrlich discovers the spy is Elsa, who had seduced Napier for military information. Elsa is cynically dismissive of Ehrlich's personal integrity. Ehrlich's chief officer, the pro-Nazi Kirchner (Lyle Bettger), who is also with German intelligence, soon makes advances on Elsa. Old, slow and short on coal, the Ergenstrasse is seen as easy prey by the Australian Navy and by Napier in particular, who understandably holds a grudge. The wily Ehrlich leads his enemies on a chase across the Pacific Ocean, pausing only briefly for supplies at an unmanned rescue station on Auckland Island. Three fishermen are already marooned there, but Kirchner casually murders them and takes most of their supplies. He tells no one. The pursuing Napier discovers the bodies and, believing his old friend is responsible, vows to bring Ehrlich to justice as a war criminal. Ehrlich, meanwhile, sets course for the remote, uninhabited Pacific island of Pom Pom GalliThis fictitious island is also mentioned in the film La Classe américaine (1993). in the Tuamotus. Running out of coal, Ehrlich begins burning wood from the ship for fuel, upsetting crew when the lifeboats are burned. A potential mutiny is averted as they reach the island. While Ehrlich drives the crew to harvest timber there for fuel, he impresses Elsa with his humane side. Discovering that Kirchner murdered the fishermen, an angry Ehrlich forces him to sign an account of his actions in the ship's log. Napier finally convinces the Rockhamptons captain that Ehrlich will be at Pom Pom Galli, but they arrive too late. Both ships make for Valparaíso in neutral Chile, where Napier cannot attack. In port, a frustrated Napier confronts Ehrlich about the murders. Ehrlich says that if they catch the Ergenstrasse they can read the truth in his log. Meanwhile Elsa learns the truth herself, distances herself from Kirchner, and declares her love for Ehrlich. Luck is with the Ergenstrasse when the Rockhampton is called away to support cruisers facing the German pocket battleship Graf Spee in Montevideo, Uruguay. Napier requests a transfer to the British Naval patrols in the North Sea, believing that Ehrlich must pass that way in his attempt to reach Kiel. Napier flies to England as the Ergenstrasse, resupplied with coal and lifeboats, departs for Germany. For political reasons, German radio broadcasts a message through Lord Haw-Haw disclosing the Ergenstrasse's position near Norway, thus exposing the ship to the Royal Navy and the prowling Napier, now commanding a corvette. Napier tracks down Ehrlich's ship and sinks it in the North Sea. Ehrlich orders the crew to evacuate and take the ship's log. Only he, Elsa, and an unwilling Kirchner remain aboard for a short, one-sided battle, during which Elsa embraces Erlich as the Ergenstrasse is bombarded. Their fate is unclear but the other crewmen hand over the log, proving to Napier that Kirchner committed the murders alone.

John Wayne came down with ear infections twice during the shooting of the film, and two other actors received infections due to skin diving. The song that Lana Turner sings is \\"Steh' Ich im Finster Mitternacht\\", which is also known as \\"Treue Liebe\\". The German song had English lyrics written specifically for the film. The fictional HMAS Rockhampton is played by , a built in Canada as a wartime emergency anti-submarine escort. She was placed in reserve in 1945, but in 1954 had recently been updated and recommissioned as a . This class has a classic wartime outline, similar to the Black Swan and Grimsby class sloops operated by the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy in 1939 including HMS Morecambe Bay and , which served in the Pacific, and is now a museum ship on the River Thames in London. Factual basis The script was adapted from a novel of the same name by Andrew Geer, which in turn was based on an incident involving the 1929-built German Norddeutscher Lloyd steamer Erlangen (6,100 tons). Under the captaincy of Alfred Grams, the freighter slipped out of Otago Harbour, New Zealand, on 28 August 1939, on the very eve of war, ostensibly for Port Kembla, New South Wales, where she was to have filled her coal bunkers for the homeward passage to Europe. She then headed for the subantarctic Auckland Islands, where she successfully evaded the cruiser and re-stocked with food and wood, cutting down large swathes of the Southern Rata forest. The freighter then made a desperate and successful escape—using jerry-rigged sails—to Ancud in southern Chile. She subsequently made her way into the South Atlantic, where she was intercepted off Montevideo on 24 July 1941 by , and scuttled by her crew. Though using the same basic plot as the film, the book painted Kirchner as the hero and Ehrlich as the villain, essentially swapping their roles; the book portrays Kirchner and Keller as unintended victims of Erlich's obsession, though in both stories, the key characters all appear to go down with the ship at the climax. A named was built by Walkers Limited in Queensland in 1942 for the Royal Australian Navy. She operated in Australian and New Guinea waters during the later years of the Second World War, three years after the events depicted in the film. James Arness was an extra in the movie co-inciding with his first year starring in Gunsmoke, totally supported by John Wayne in the opening of the first episode of Gunsmoke.

Situated in Bandel, Hooghly district of West Bengal, it stands as a memorial to the Portuguese settlement in Bengal. Founded in 1599, it is dedicated to Nossa Senhora do Rosário, Our Lady of the Rosary. It is also a parish church, part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta. It is one of the most prominent historical churches in West Bengal as well as in India. History Our Lady of Happy Voyage Shrine, rooftop Bandel Basilica. Around the middle of the 16th century, the Portuguese began using Bandel as a port. During or around 1571, they were given permission by Akbar, the Mughal emperor, to build a town in Hooghly. As they began settling around the area, their priests began to baptise the natives - by 1598, Catholics in Hooghly numbered around five thousand, including natives and mixed races. In 1579, the Portuguese built a port on the banks of the Hooghly, as well as a fort, and enlisted the services of a band of Augustinian Friars, then the largest religious body in Goa. The following year, Captain Pedro Tavares obtained the emperor's full permission to preach the Catholic faith publicly, and erect churches. Thus the Bandel Church came to be constructed in 1599. This first church was burnt down during the sacking of Hooghly by the Moors in 1632. A newer church, constructed by Gomez de Soto (also spelt John Comes de Soto), was built over the ruin in 1660. The keystone of the older church can still be seen on the eastern gate of the monastery, bearing the date 1599. On November 25, 1988, Pope John Paul II declared the sanctuary a minor basilica. Layout A ship's mast stands in front of the church; it was presented to the church by the captain of a vessel that had encountered a storm in the Bay of Bengal, and its rescue was attributed to Mary. The church has three altars, several tombstones, an organ, and a shrine to Mary.

In 1994, at the behest of Preservation Virginia, archaeologist William Kelso began directing excavations at Historic Jamestowne on Jamestown Island. By 1996, the Jamestown Rediscovery team had discovered the foundations of the 1607 James Fort, long thought to have disappeared in the waters of the James River. Initially a 10-year project, given the wealth of knowledge and artifacts uncovered throughout its lifetime, it has been continued indefinitely. History In 1994, Preservation Virginia agreed to fund a 10-year archaeological project called Jamestown Rediscovery, in order to archaeologically explore their land. The original goal was to locate archaeological remains of \\"the first years of settlement at Jamestown, especially of the earliest fortified town; [and the] subsequent growth and development of the town\\". On April 4 work was begun in the area near the church protected by the 1900 sea wall, and archaeologists quickly discovered early colonial artifacts. In 1996, they successfully located parts of the palisade of the original 1607 James Fort. The news was then made public on September 12 by the governor. Subsequent excavations have shown that only one corner of the first triangular fort (which contained the original settlement) turned out to have been destroyed. In 2006, the first well located in a cellar on the site was excavated. In 2007, to mark the 400th anniversary, Queen Elizabeth II re-visited the site (having first been there in 1957). In 2010, archaeologists discovered the site of the second church constructed at Jamestown. In May 2013, in conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution, the project announced the discovery of a young English woman who had been cannibalized during the \\"starving time\\" winter of 1609-1610. In July 2015, the remains of four principals of the colony were identified by the Rediscovery/Smithsonian team. From late 2016, attention has moved to the Memorial Church. Impact of research Since it began, the extended archaeological campaign has made multiple significant discoveries. In addition, it has uncovered much of the fort, the remains of several houses and wells, a palisade wall line attached to the fort and the graves of several of the early settlers. Visitors can now view the site of James Fort, the 17th- century church tower and the site of the 17th-century town, as well as tour an archaeological museum called the Archaearium and view some of the artifacts found. Excavations continuing on the site have uncovered evidence of the Starving Time winter of 1609/10, the arrival of the survivors from the Bermuda shipwreck Sea Venture and close to 1.5 million artifacts. The colonists' structures have been identified including temporary soldiers' shelters, row houses, wells, the storehouse, and the 1608 church. The original 10-year archaeological project has continued well past this period; current visitors to the site can see ongoing excavation efforts as they continue to unearth the original settlement's buildings and artifacts near the James Fort site and Jamestown Church. Several of the archaeologist teams' discoveries have been named as the top 10 archaeology finds in various years by Archaeology, including evidence that the colonists had likely resorted to cannibalism during the \\"starving time\\" from finds in 2013, and the discovery of the original church built inside James Fort in 2010, and subsequently the identification of four graves within it belonging to important Jamestown settlers in 2015. =Supposed loss= 1958 image of Jamestown Island showing the supposed and actual locations of the fort Jamestown Rediscovery lies in the correction of a historical myth previously thought to be true – that the site of the original Jamestown settlement of 1607 had washed into the James River long ago. The archaeologists, including William Kelso, Beverly (Bly) Straube, and Nick Luccketti, used primary source material to estimate the location of the fort on Jamestown Island, such as the Zuniga Map, created by a Spanish spy of the same name, and the accounts of original colonists, such as William Strachey, Captain Ralph Hamor, and John Smith.(with B. Straube) Jamestown Rediscovery: 1994-2004. Richmond: APVA Preservation Virginia, 2004. Content from pages 15 - 16. Upon analysis of these sources and other buildings, the Jamestown Rediscovery archaeologists discovered the postholes of the original fort; discoloration in the soil left the evidence of the palisades and bulwarks that once formed the fort wall.(with B. Straube) Jamestown Rediscovery: 1994-2004. Richmond: APVA Preservation Virginia, 2004. After expanding the dig, the archaeologists were able to validate that the Jamestown Fort had only begun to wash into the James River, but was instead covered inadvertently by a Confederate earthwork during the American Civil War. Throughout this excavation, the team discovered evidence of fort buildings, artifacts, and the remains of settlers.(with B. Straube) Jamestown Rediscovery: 1994-2004. Richmond: APVA Preservation Virginia, 2004. Content from pages 65 - 80 and 105 - 107 =Wealth of finds= To date the project had retrieved over two million artifacts, a large fraction of them from the first few years of the settlement's history. The discovery of a well within the limits of the Jamestown fort is less critical for understanding the colonial attempt to find a fresh water source and more important due to the artifacts found in the well. Wells that had stopped providing (or never provided) drinkable water were frequently filled in with the refuse of daily life, which gave the archaeologists the opportunity to look at a concentrated collection of stratified artifacts. Tobacco pipes, pottery sherds, and combat armor all help date the excavation site to the early 17th century, giving even more support to the positive identification of the fort.(with B. Straube) Jamestown Rediscovery: 1994-2004. Richmond: APVA Preservation Virginia, 2004. Content from pages 132 - 135. In this case, curator Beverly Straube was able to substantiate evidence regarding the professional work done by the original settlers. Goldsmiths, bricklayers, masons, perfumers, tailors, fishermen, coopers, blacksmiths, glassmakers, carpenters, and tobacco pipe makers are among the dominant professions for which there is archaeological evidence.(with B. Straube) Jamestown Rediscovery: 1994-2004. Richmond: APVA Preservation Virginia, 2004. Content from pages 155 - 192. =Notable figures= The Jamestown Rediscovery project recovered and cataloged the remains of many of the original Jamestown settlers. For example, one of the first human finds was the skeleton of a higher-status man aged around 19-20 who died due to a musket shot to the lower right leg that shattered the bones there leading to a quick death. The skeleton was examined by Doug Owsley from the Smithsonian, and the flattened skull was then forensically reconstructed and imagined. Later, among the discoveries in the cellar was the skull of a young woman who had clearly been cannibalized. She was around fourteen years old at the time of her death from unknown causes. The research team has named her \\"Jane\\", and her identity is unknown, and although DNA samples have been saved for future examination, there is little hope of identifying modern relatives for comparative testing.\\"A 'Starving Time' Tragedy\\", historicjamestowne.org. Retrieved 2016-01-14/ A grave site with indications of an important figure was also located. The skeletal remains of one of the original colonists was found separated from the other burials and located in a place of honor near one of the fort's gates. The individual had been buried in a coffin, along with a staff signifying leadership. It had long been thought that Baron De La Warr, who died en route back to the colony from England on his second trip, had been buried elsewhere but some recent research concluded that his body was in fact brought to Jamestown for burial. Some theorize the remains to be that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, one of the organizers of the colony, though others have claimed it to be the remains of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. While inquiries continue regarding who this individual is, even going as far as genealogical study in England, his identity remains unknown. Remains were also excavated from the chancel of the church built in 1608 – \\"potentially the first Protestant church built in the new world, and the men's burial there signals their high status in the colony, the researchers said\\". The four are potentially identified as \\"Rev. Robert Hunt, thought to be the first Anglican minister in the Americas; Capt. Gabriel Archer, the early expeditionary leader; Sir Ferdinando Wainman, the cousin of Sir Thomas West, the Virginian governor; and Capt. William West, the governor's uncle\\".Fandos, Nicholas, \\"Remains of Early Colonial Jamestown Leaders Are Identified\\", New York Times, July 28, 2015. Retrieved 2015-07-28. At present, these identifications are based on circumstantial evidence. =Unique identity= The first settlers included men with experience of warfare and fort-building in the low countries during the Dutch Revolt. These people brought a wider set of skills and experiences than the English settlers. Further, the ongoing needs to adapt to life in Virginia and to interact with the indigenous peoples soon led to the expression of local culture, as evidence in artefacts such as modified armor or locally made clay pipes.

It was written and produced by Jules Furthman, and presented by Howard Hughes. Filming lasted more than eighteen months, beginning in 1949.\\"Detail View: 'Jet Fighter'.\\" American Film Institute. Retrieved: June 2, 2014. The last day of shooting was in May 1953, but the Technicolor film was kept out of release by Hughes due to his tinkering until October 1957, by which time Hughes had sold RKO. Universal-International ended up distributing Jet Pilot.Hardwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 57. The film went through several directorial changes, after Sternberg's work between October 1949 and February 1950. After that, Philip Cochran (supervisor of aerial sequences), Furthman, Edward Killy (unit production manager), Byron Haskin (for the model work), and Don Siegel also directed scenes (Siegel's weren't used), as did Howard Hughes himself.Barlett 2004, p. 168 All were uncredited as directors or second unit directors. Although Jet Pilot was publicized as showcasing the U.S. Air Force's latest jets, by the time it was finally shown, most of the aircraft in the film were obsolescent or obsolete, supplanted by more modern aircraft. In one aerial scene, the two lead characters fly a Lockheed F-94 Starfire to test a radar approach to intercept a propeller driven Convair B-36 bomber. Jet Pilot was reportedly Howard Hughes's favorite film, one he watched repeatedly in his later years. Plot A Soviet defector lands a jet fighter aircraft on an American airstrip. The base commander, Air Force Colonel Jim Shannon (John Wayne), is surprised to find that the pilot is an attractive woman, Lieutenant Anna Marladovna (Janet Leigh). When she asks for asylum, but refuses to disclose any military information, Shannon is assigned to seduce her. They fall in love. Worried about the possibility of Anna's deportation, Jim marries her without permission. When they return from their unauthorized honeymoon, Major General Black (Jay C. Flippen) takes Jim aside and informs him that his new wife is a spy, sent to relay information back to the USSR. The Americans decide to play along, and escalate the situation. Shannon goes home to tell Anna that she is to be imprisoned for years, then deported when she is finally released. To save her, they hatch an escape plan, steal an aircraft, and fly to Soviet airspace. Their arrival is not shown, but Anna is criticized for allowing Shannon to crash the more advanced American aircraft when Russian fighters closed in, rather than fighting back. She says that she considered shooting him, then decided that he would be more valuable for his knowledge than the plane would have been. While they are there, Shannon discovers that Anna is pregnant. Shannon is then assigned to help test new aircraft, a pretext for drugging him and pumping him for information about American aircraft. He learns much about Soviet capabilities from the questions he is asked, while only giving up outdated information in return. When Anna discovers this, she initially plans to turn him in, but as she learns he is to be drugged into permanent insensibility, she lets her personal feelings override her sense of duty. Finding herself under suspicion, she disposes of the agent sent to keep an eye on her, steals an aircraft, and escapes back to the West with Shannon.

Dmitri Langrad Production Hughes intended to make a \\"jet-age\\" Hell's Angels to the extent that the flying scenes were the most important element, and led to his obsessive re-editing that stretched into years.Roberts and Olson 1997, p. 351. The lead actors fretted that the screenplay was \\"silly\\", with Wayne only taking on the role because he thought it would make a political statement, but soon realized it would become \\"one of the worst films\\" he would ever make.Munn 2004, p. 130. Wayne would later recall, \\"The final budget was something like four million. It was just too stupid for words.\\"Munn 2004, p. 131. Location filming took place primarily at Edwards Air Force Base and Hamilton Air Force Base, California, with full cooperation from the United States Air Force.Farmer 1989, p. 14. Much of the filming of flying scenes was done at Edwards using a North American B-45 Tornado bomber as a camera aircraft. Chuck Yeager, the first man to fly faster than the speed of sound, was assigned by the U.S. Air Force to fly for the film.\\"Notes: 'Jet Pilot'.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: December 17, 2012. Yeager would fly in the X-1, staged for the film cameras, on May 20, 1950.Farmer 1989, p. 16. Another senior jet pilot who flew in the movie was USAF Major Charles Rayburn Cunningham. He and another senior jet pilot, USAF Ret Lt. Col Glen M. \\"Johnny\\" Johnson, flew for John Wayne and Janet Leigh. The F-86A Sabre jets depicted in the early sequences were actual operational aircraft of the 94th Fighter Squadron, the first unit so equipped in the USAF, shortly after their conversion to the type in 1949. Yeager would also fly the F-86A in a series of aerobatic maneuvers, under the direction of \\"air boss\\" Paul Mantz who coordinated the aerial sequences.Farmer 1989, p. 24. Location filming for the Russian air base was done at George Air Force Base, a World War II air base with many of its wartime structures still intact, giving the base a primitive appearance. The 94th FS and its parent 1st Fighter Group were actually based at George during filming, and had just finished a deployment to Ladd Air Force Base, Alaska, as depicted in the storyline. The \\"Soviet parasite fighter\\" that Shannon flies is actually a Bell X-1, the first supersonic aircraft design in the world. The \\"Yak-12\\" at the film's beginning is a black-painted Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star. The \\"mother ship\\" for the Soviet parasite fighter is actually a Boeing B-50, a development of the B-29. ; The black fighter that appears near the finale, taxiing on the parking ramp and behind the \\"mother ship\\" is a Northrop F-89 Scorpion. An F-86 Sabre is used to depict a Russian chase aircraft, painted in dark colors, high visibility orange, and gray juxtaposed to obscure its actual silhouette. The unpainted fighter that Olga is to test fly is a Northrop F-89 Scorpion. John Wayne's character and other characters wear both the original Army Air Forces uniform and the newer USAF blue uniform. Reception =Critical response= Despite the obvious similarities to other successful films, including Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka (1939), Comrade X (1940), as well as the more recent dud, The Iron Petticoat (1956), by the time Jet Pilot hit the screens, it looked dated and received universally poor reviews. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, referred to it as \\"silly and sorry\\", doomed by a \\"weak script, poor direction, and indifferent performances by all\\", concluding that it was far from being Hughes's next Hell's Angels.Crowther, Bosley. \\"Jet Pilot (1957); Screen: 'Jet Pilot' lands; Film at Palace barely gets off the ground.\\" The New York Times, October 5, 1957. For aviation fans, even the aerial scenes were greatly reduced, as much of the principal photography had taken place early in 1950, making Jet Pilot something of a historical curiosity.Farmer 1989, p. 28. Movie historian Andrew Sarris, writing for the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) Josef von Sternberg film retrospective, expressed a better opinion of the film than Crowther. Categorizing Jet Pilot as a stealth comedy, Sarris praises its \\"humor and sensuality\\" as \\"enduringly enjoyable\\" despite a poor reputation among critics.Sarris, 1966. p. 51-52 He said that Sternberg \\"reduces the Cold War to an animated cartoon\\" and anticipates a number of metaphors that would appear in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 black comedy, Dr. Strangelove. Jet Pilot includes an inflight refueling sequence between aircraft flown by a Russian jet pilot (Janet Leigh) and an American pilot (John Wayne) that makes Kubrick's sequence look tame. The fighter jets become interchangeable with the characters, a comic anthropomorphism where \\"the planes enjoy a more active sex life than the human beings\\". Sarris considers Wayne and Leigh to be miscast in a Sternberg film, who were more at home in the \\"Ford galaxy\\" or the \\"Hitchcock universe\\", respectively. He concluded that however \\"meaningless\\" the film, Sternberg's Jet Pilot \\"soars in an ecstatic flight of speed, grace and color\\" and, all said, is a \\"highly entertaining\\" work.Sarris, 1966. p. 52 See also * List of American films of 1957 * John Wayne filmography References Notes Citations Bibliography * Barlett, Donald L. and James B.

After reaching a peak weight of around and having been unable to leave his bed since 2002, he lost approximately —over one third of his body weight—with the help of doctors and nutritionists by February 2008. However, he died in his hometown on 26 May 2014 weighing . Uribe drew worldwide attention in January 2006, when he made an emotional plea on a Mexican television network that prompted both private and public assistance. He was also featured on The World's Heaviest Man, a 2007 television documentary about his bedridden life and attempts to overcome his obesity, and in The World's Heaviest Man Gets Married, a similar documentary that was broadcast in 2009 by the Discovery Channel. Personal life Uribe lived in San Nicolás de los Garza, a suburb of Monterrey, Nuevo León, and according to the Associated Press he weighed during his adolescence. \\"I used to eat normal, just like all Mexicans do … beans, rice, flour tortilla, corn tortilla, french fries, hamburgers, subs and pizzas, whatever regular people eat\\". He married his first wife in 1987 and the couple immigrated to the United States for employment opportunities. They settled in Dallas, Texas, where he was employed as a technician fixing typewriters, electronic calculators and computers. The nature of his job required Uribe to spend his day sitting at a desk. Reflecting on those years, Uribe commented: \\"Life in the United States is like that, you just go from your desk to your car. I used to drive my car to and from work, so I didn't get any exercise\\". His sedentary lifestyle may have contributed to the onset of his morbid obesity since it appears to be, according to a scientific study published in Clinical Cardiology, one of the major risk factors including a poor diet. After five years living in a new country, his obesity sharply increased and took a toll in his emotional stability: \\"[My wife] asked me for a divorce ... I was very depressed ... Everything ended on account of my obesity, because I spent a lot of money trying to see doctors, going on diets, and I just gained more weight.\\" Diet and weight loss Manuel Uribe returned to Mexico and eventually made an emotional plea for help on national television. The government appointed a group of doctors and certified nutritionists to help him lose weight, but while he turned down offers for gastric bypass surgery in Italy and Spain, he caught the attention of Barry Sears, the creator of the Zone diet. Sears prescribed him a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates that consisted of five meals in small portions that included egg-white omelets, salads, chicken, fish, fruits and spring greens. His dramatic reduction in weight – reportedly by February 2008 – prompted him to set his sights on a second Guinness World Record: \\"The World's Greatest Loser of Weight\\", which presumably was never certified. Uribe tried to capitalize on his new-found fame by announcing plans to launch the Manuel Uribe Foundation, an institution aiming to educate Mexican people about nutrition and obesity, but the organization was never legally constituted. On 3 October 2008, he gave diet advice to José Luis Garza, a critically obese and bedridden fellow Mexican who weighed . Garza, a former chef at a bowling alley who was unable to get out of his bed for four months, commented: \\"Manuel inspires me with courage and the will to live. I understand that this is a matter of life and death and that I have to follow the instructions that are given to me.\\" Uribe's girlfriend Claudia Solís visited Garza's home with kiwifruit, grapefruit, pears, and protein supplements, and Uribe promised to help Garza get a wheel-equipped iron bed; however, Garza died five days later on 8 October 2008.Mark Walsh . Associated Press. 4 October 2008 Second wedding On 26 October 2008, after four years together, Uribe – who weighed in at after shedding – married his second wife Claudia from his bed. He said: \\"I am proof you can find love in any circumstances. It's all a question of faith. I have a wife and will form a new family and live a happy life.\\"World's heaviest man ties the knot. NBC News (27 October 2008). He was transported to the civil wedding on his specially-reinforced four-poster bed, draped with cream and gold and adorned in bright sunflowers, on the back of a truck. Donning a white silk shirt with a sheet around his legs, he waited to greet Claudia as she walked down a flight of stairs wearing a strapless ivory dress and a tiara in front of over 400 guests. Despite the publicity, his second marriage was short-lived and ended, according to Uribe's mother, some three- and-a-half years before his death in 2014. Death Uribe was hospitalized on 2 May 2014 after suffering several cardiac arrhythmias and liver failure. He died on 26 May 2014, at the age of 48 at 10:30 AM local time. His cause of death is attributed to liver failure. After his death, the body was cremated and his ashes were buried at an undisclosed place in Monterrey.

It is a general-purpose, hierarchical classification system, and consists of five categorical levels from the most general to the most specific: order, suborder, great group, subgroup, and family. An interactive, online key is available. The Australian Soil Classification supersedes other classification systems previously developed for Australian soils, including the Factual Key (1960) and the Handbook of Australian Soils (1968). Structure of the classification system =Order level= At the top, most general, level of the Australian Soil Classification, there are fourteen soil orders. They are: Anthroposols, Organosols, Podosols, Vertosols, Hydrosols, Kurosols, Sodosols, Chromosols, Calcarosols, Ferrosols, Dermosols, Kandosols, Rudosols and Tenosols. The character of the soil orders reflects the arid, strongly-weathered nature of the Australian continent. = Suborder level = For the Vertosol, Kurosol, Sodosol, Chromosol, Ferrosol, Dermosol and Kandosol orders, the suborder-level categories reflect the dominant colour of the upper part of the B2 horizon. There are five suborder colour categories, namely Red, Brown, Yellow, Grey and Black. The colour classes have the same names as, but are not directly equivalent to, those used in the Factual Key and estimated using a subset of the Munsell Colour System. The full suborder designation then becomes Red Kurosol, Grey Vertosol, for example. The remaining soil orders have suborder categories that reflect unique characteristics of the given order.

Seiter and starring Claire Trevor and John Wayne. Based on the 1937 novel The First Rebel by Neil H. Swanson, with a screenplay by the film's producer, P. J. Wolfson, the film is loosely based on the historical event known as the Black Boys Rebellion of 1765, after the conclusion of the French and Indian War. It was produced by RKO Pictures. Clad in buckskin and a coonskin cap (as he would be a decade later in The Fighting Kentuckian), Wayne plays real-life James Smith, an American coping with British rule in colonial America. The supporting cast includes Brian Donlevy, George Sanders and Chill Wills. Claire Trevor and John Wayne also headed the cast of John Ford's Stagecoach the same year, and in both films as well as Dark Command the following year, Trevor is top-billed over Wayne due to her greater name value at the time. The film did not fare well in its initial release. The superficially similar John Ford film Drums Along the Mohawk had been released only one week prior. In the United Kingdom, where the film kept the original title, it was initially banned by the Ministry of Information for placing the British, already at war against Nazi Germany, in a bad light. Plot In the southwestern Pennsylvania region, of colonial America, in the 1760s, colonial distaste and disapproval of the British government is starting to surface. Many local colonists have been killed by Native Americans, who are armed with rifles supplied by white traders. Local adventurer, James Smith (John Wayne) and his followers complain to British officials, pressuring them to make it illegal to trade weapons to the Indians. Trader Ralph Callender (Brian Donlevy) and other businessmen are not happy with the new law, as it cuts into their profit. They continue to trade with the local Native American population, hiding rifles and rum inside military supply trains. When the British authorities fail to do anything to prevent this, James Smith organizes his men and heads out to intercept the wagon train. Smith's spirited and bold girlfriend, Janie McDougall (Claire Trevor), assists him and his men in posing as Indians to intercept the gun shipments. Captain Swanson, a British army officer, is sent to protect the wagon train at all costs, following a complaint lodged by Callender, that Smith and his men intend to rob the wagon train, while neglecting to state that the train contains guns and liquor. Captain Swanson considers the involvement of Smith and his men as a revolt against his authority, and in retaliation, he jails more than half of the local colonists, holding them without trial. This sets Smith and Swanson on a collision course. Cast * Claire Trevor as Janie MacDougall * John Wayne as James Smith * George Sanders as Capt.

The paper is one of the oldest newspapers published in the country. History Al Madina had been founded — as a weekly publication, under the name of Al Madinah al Manawarah (in English, Madinah the Radiant) by Hisham Hafiz's uncles, Othman and Ali Hafiz, as a weekly newspaper on 8 April 1937. Later, it became semi-weekly. Its publication was ceased during World War II, and resumed following the war, renamed as Al Madinah in 1958, and its headquarters was moved to Jeddah in the early 1960s, and as of the 21th century (under the title Al Madina) function in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam. It has offices in Dubai and Cairo, in addition to 18 branches inside Saudi Arabia. At the beginning of the 2000s Al Madina had a circulation of 46,370 copies; in 2001, its circulation was 60,000 copies. The estimated circulation of the paper in 2003 was 46,000 copies, and as of 2007, increased to 60,000 copies. Political approach and contents Al Madina is pro-government, and one of the most well-known such Saudi newspapers. Every issue begins with the invocation of the name of the God. Although Al Madina is considered to be a pro-government paper, it publishes critical coverage of non-political local news, such as social, health and educational issues. Al Madina has relatively critical columnists, despite restraint in reporting or commenting on national politics. Some modernist or reformist columns have been published in Al Madina. For instance, writing for the editors in April 2010, Basma bint Saud said she could not find Qur'anic, or other Islamic historical, basis for a state institution undertaking to promote virtue and prevent vice; she further argued that the arrests and beatings by religious policemen contribute to incorrect impressions about Islam. On 2 August 2017 the newspaper criticized many Arab states, said to maintain relations with Israel but deny it, [although] these ties can hardly be denied given the existence of embassies, and of mutual visits, in full view. It went on to call on Arab nations to end their hypocrisy, in which they \\"maintain relations\\" with Israel but \\"don’t want anybody to know about them\\". Prominent columnists Hisham Hafiz and Khaled Almaeena formerly were the chief editors. Mohammad Ali Hafiz also served in the post between 1961 and 1964. As of 2012 Fahd Al Aqran was the editor-in-chief. The general manager of Al Arabiya TV, Abdulrahman Al Rashed is one of the paper's senior columnists. Status and awards The publishing house Al Madina Press that is the owner and publisher of the paper is one of the most prominent companies in Saudi Arabia. Al Madinah was awarded two major prizes in Saudi Arabia in 2010: Makkah Prize of Distinction and Asir Prize \\"Al Muftaha\\".

Juan Valverde de Amusco (or \\"de Hamusco\\") (c. 1525-?) was born in the Crown of Castille in what is now Spain in about the year 1525 and studied medicine in Padua and Rome under Realdo Columbo and Bartolomeo Eustachi. He published several works on anatomy, including De animi et corporis sanitate tuenda libellus (Paris, 1552). Valverde's most famous work was Historia de la composicion del cuerpo humano, first published in Rome, 1556. All but four of its 42 engraved copperplate illustrations were taken almost directly from Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica. Vesalius bitterly commented on Valverde's plagiarism, accusing him of having performed very few dissections himself. Occasionally, however, Valverde corrected Vesalius' images, as in his depictions of the muscles of the eyes, nose, and larynx. One of Valverde's most striking original plates is that of a muscle figure holding his own skin in one hand and a knife in the other, which has been likened to Saint Bartholomew in The Last Judgment (Michelangelo) of the Sistine Chapel. The original illustrations were most likely drawn by Gaspar Becerra (1520–1570), a contemporary of Michelangelo, and the copperplate engravings are thought to have been carried out by Nicolas Beatrizet (1507?-1570?), whose initials \\"NB\\" appear on several of the plates.

He is the head of computer science at Zuse Institute Berlin. His contributions to the field include the NegaScout algorithm.  Biography  Alexander Reinefeld studied physics at the Technical University of Braunschweig and computer science at the University of Hamburg and during two one-year visits in Edmonton at the University of Alberta. In 1982 he concluded his graduate in computer science and in 1987 he received his Ph.D at the University of Hamburg. From 1983 to 1987, he worked as a scientific employee, and from 1989 to 1992 as assistant at the University of Hamburg. During the years 1987 to 1990 he collected industrial experience as a management consultant in the areas of systems analysis, databases and compiler building. In 1992 Reinefeld collaborated with the Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing (PC²) at the University of Paderborn. Since 1998, Alexander Reinefeld leads the area of Computer Science in the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB). He is a member of the Gesellschaft für Informatik, the ACM, the IEEE Computer Society, the German university association Deutscher Hochschulverband (DHV) and Chair of Parallel and Distributed Systems at the Humboldt University of Berlin.  Search algorithms  In 1983 Alexander Reinefeld introduced the NegaScout search-algorithm, an improvement of Judea Pearl's Scout. Ten years later, in 1993 Reinefeld made an attempt to resuscitate Stockman's SSS* algorithm, and proposed an improvement of the recursive RecSSS*, initially developed by Subir Bhattacharya and Amitava Bagchi. Despite promising results with some trees of depth 8, the space (memory) requirements were still too high, and with the research of Aske Plaat, Wim Pijls and Arie de Bruin concerning alpha–beta pruning algorithm with zero windows and transposition table in SSS* and Dual* as MT, SSS* was finally declared \\"dead\\" by Pijls and De Bruin in 1996.  Chess programs  In 1979 at the University of Hamburg, motivated and supported by his advisor Frieder Schwenkel, Alexander Reinefeld designed the chess program Murks, partly implemented in microcode for an Interdata M85 minicomputer. Reinefeld claimed that world chess champion Mikhail Botvinnik played against Murks during his visit. In 1980/81, a team of four students, Manfred Allers, Dirk Hauschildt, Dieter Steinwender and Alexander Reinefeld, ported Murks to a Motorola 68000 microprocessor, then dubbed MicroMurks. They built their own MC68000 microcomputer from scratch. Micromurks II represented by Dieter Steinwender, participated at the WMCCC 1983 in Budapest.

All 40 people on board were killed. Background The aircraft involved was a PRC-produced Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane, one of four that were part of the country's efforts to expand its air defences. The exact model of aircraft involved was never officially identified, although it is believed to have been a KJ-200.Jane's Defence The aircraft had been developed in 2002, and have been undergoing extensive tests since then.Chinese Crash An AWACS? - Forecast International - Obtained April 29, 2007. The plane was carrying thirty-five electronics and avionics technicians, as well as five crewmembers. It is believed by aviation experts that the large number of people on board the aircraft indicated that some form of test was being conducted. Carrying such a large number of people allowed the plane to avoid transmitting real time data back to the ground, which could be compromised by foreign intelligence services. Crash The aircraft flew into a hillside, killing all on board. It was one of the worst disasters in the history of the Chinese air force. Investigation The Central Military Commission announced of the investigation result on September 7, 2006. The official explanation was that the accident was due to heavy ice formation on the wings after the aircraft made repeated passes in and out of clouds in bad weather. The announcement also declared that nearly a dozen high-ranking military officers were punished, including: * Jiang Jianzeng, commander of the Nanjing Military Region Air Force (MRAF) and deputy commander of the Nanjing Military Region (MR), was censured. *Wang Wei (王伟), political commissar of the Nanjing MRAF and deputy political commissar of the Nanjing MR, was censured. * Yue Liu'an (岳留安), deputy minister of equipment of the PLA Air Force, was censured. * Guo Chunguang (郭春广), deputy chief-of-staff of the Nanjing MRAF, was demoted. * Zhang Guangjian (张广建), a regimental commander of the Nanjing MRAF, was removed from his post. * At least six more military officers were also punished.

He was also a world-record-holding breaststroke swimmer, a decorated World War II Marine officer, an academic in educational administration, and an author of books on kendo, the culture of Japan, and the history of the Ryukyu Islands. Early life and war service Warner grew up among Nisei in Long Beach, California, and began watching Samurai cinema and studying Japanese martial arts as a teenager. Tall and athletic, he became captain of the University of Southern California swim team, and lived in a Japanese dorm. On graduating in 1936 with a bachelor's degree in social science he joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve as a second lieutenant. At the urging of two senior officers, lieutenant colonel Anthony Biddle and captain Chesty Puller, he traveled to Tokyo in 1937 to continue his studies in Japanese martial arts. He became a student of Moriji Mochida and Masuda Shinsuke, and reached the rank of shodan in kendo two years later, also beginning to learn iaido, but had to leave Japan in haste after the Kenpeitai learned from his correspondence that he was a Marine officer. From 1939 to 1941, Warner was a teacher and swimming coach in Hawaii, at the Punahou Academy in Honolulu and then at Maui High School. In an exhibition event of the Palama invitational swim meet in Honolulu in 1939, he set the world record for the 220-yard breaststroke, previously held by Leonard Spence, with a time of 2:51.5. In 1941 he was called to United States Marine Corps service as a combat instructor at the Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia. He was later deployed to the South Pacific, where his fluency in the Japanese language allowed him to understand spoken orders from the Japanese and to confuse Japanese soldiers with false orders of his own. He became the first to raise the American flag on Bougainville Island in the Landings at Cape Torokina in November 1943. Less than a week later he lost his left leg when a tank he was commanding was attacked after taking out six machine gun nests. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism in this battle, and the Purple Heart for being injured while serving. Later life and professional career Warner retired from the Marines as a lieutenant colonel. He returned to civilian life and to the University of Southern California, where he earned master's degrees in 1944 and again in 1950. His 1950 thesis for a Master of Arts in history was Artificial limb development: A history of the Northrop Artificial Limb Research Department 96, Project 17, founded on prosthesis development. From 1950 to 1954 he studied education at the University of California, Berkeley, completing a doctorate in 1954 with the dissertation History of the continuation education program in California. At this time he also took up kendo again, despite his missing leg. With Benjamin Hazard he helped found two of the first post-war Kendo groups in the US, in Berkeley in the spring of 1953 and again in Oakland, California in the fall of the same year. After completing his doctorate he became an assistant professor at California State University, Long Beach. He traveled to Japan in 1956 to attend an international kendo match between American and Japanese kendo masters, hosted a return match in Long Beach in 1957, and continued visiting Japan repeatedly in subsequent years. He remained at Long Beach State until 1964, as coach of swimming and water polo and as chair of the department of educational administration. In 1964, Warner retired from his faculty position to become the director of the Education Department of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands, on Okinawa Island. In the early 1970s he was the historian and curator of the US Armed Forces Museum on Okinawa, which closed in 1976. He continued practicing kendo, eventually reaching the 7th dan. He also reached the 6th dan in iaido. In 2001 the emperor of Japan awarded him the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, for his accomplishments in the martial arts. Warner died on Okinawa on March 4, 2010, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was married and had two children, a son Ion Musashi Warner and a daughter Irene Tomoe Cooper.

A Lyman-alpha emitter (LAE) is a type of distant galaxy that emits Lyman-alpha radiation from neutral hydrogen. Most known LAEs are extremely distant, and because of the finite travel time of light they provide glimpses into the history of the universe. They are thought to be the progenitors of most modern Milky Way type galaxies. These galaxies can be found nowadays rather easily in narrow-band searches by an excess of their narrow-band flux at a wavelength which may be interpreted as their redshift: : 1+z=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{1215.67\\\\mathrm{\\\\AA}} where z is the redshift, \\\\lambda is the observed wavelength, and 1215.67 Å is the wavelength of Lyman-alpha emission. The Lyman-alpha line in most LAEs is thought to be caused by recombination of interstellar hydrogen that is ionized by an ongoing burst of star-formation. Such Lyman alpha emission was first suggested as a signature of young galaxies by Bruce Partridge and P. J. E. Peebles in 1967. Experimental observations of the redshift of LAEs are important in cosmology because they trace dark matter halos and subsequently the evolution of matter distribution in the universe.  Properties  Lyman- alpha emitters are typically low mass galaxies of 108 to 1010 solar masses. They are typically young galaxies that are 200 to 600 million years old, and they have the highest specific star formation rate of any galaxies known. All of these properties indicate that Lyman-alpha emitters are important clues as to the progenitors of modern Milky Way type galaxies. Lyman-alpha emitters have many unknown properties. The Lyman-alpha photon escape fraction varies greatly in these galaxies. This is what portion of the light emitted at the Lyman-alpha line wavelength inside the galaxy actually escapes and will be visible to distant observers. There is much evidence that the dust content of these galaxies could be significant and therefore is obscuring the brightness of these galaxies. It is also possible that anisotropic distribution of hydrogen density and velocity play a significant role in the varying escape fraction due to the photons' continued interaction with the hydrogen gas (radiative transfer). Evidence now shows strong evolution in the Lyman Alpha escape fraction with redshift, most likely associated with the buildup of dust in the ISM. Dust is shown to be the main parameter setting the escape of Lyman Alpha photons. Additionally the metallicity, outflows, and detailed evolution with redshift is unknown.  Importance in cosmology  LAEs are important probes of reionization, cosmology (BAO), and they allow probing of the faint end of the luminosity function at high redshift. The baryonic acoustic oscillation signal should be evident in the power spectrum of Lyman-alpha emitters at high redshift. Constraining Cosmology with Lyman-alpha Emitters a Study Using HETDEX Parameters Baryonic acoustic oscillations are imprints of sound waves on scales where radiation pressure stabilized the density perturbations against gravitational collapse in the early universe. The three- dimensional distribution of the characteristically homogeneous Lyman-alpha galaxy population will allow a robust probe of cosmology. They are a good tool because the Lyman-alpha bias, the propensity for galaxies to form in the highest overdensity of the underlying dark matter distribution, can be modeled and accounted for. Lyman-alpha emitters are over dense in clusters.

Development KJ-2000 in 2008 The KJ-2000 development program started after the cancellation of the A-50I deal with Israel and Russia in July 2000, due to strong U.S. pressure regarding the Israeli radar that was to be mounted. China then went on to develop a domestic AWACS and the first aircraft made its maiden flight in 2003. Four KJ-2000 aircraft have been identified so far, but production of new aircraft will likely be delayed, dependent on the acquisition of IL-76 airframes. Currently, the Russian defense exporter Rosoboronexport has imposed a significant price hike on all future IL-76s delivered to China and India despite previous contracts. Both countries are currently in negotiation with Russia regarding this matter as of early 2008. In March 2011, Russia/China negotiations reached a new agreement to move production of IL-76s to Chinese owned companies, in this way it is expected production can be run smoothly to supply China with new IL-76 airframes, while delivery of Soloviev D-30KP-2 engines is not affected by recent issues. Due to unreliable external supplier sources, China has developed a backup known as the KJ-200 by installing a simplified system on board the Shaanxi Y-8. This aircraft has a similar configuration to that of the KJ-2000 and is characterized by the triple tail- fin configuration (one large and two small). Design The Chinese AWACS has a phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360degree coverage. The multi-function, three-dimensional pulse- Doppler radar was developed by NII (Nanjing Electronic Technology Research Institute), and is designed to detect and track airborne and surface targets. It operates in the frequency range of 1200–1400 MHz. The antenna system consists of three phased arrays, located in a disc. In contrast, the Russian Beriev A-50 and American Boeing E-3 Sentry use a disc. Each phased array has a 120-degree field of view. Maximum range of detection of air targets is . A-50I of India made by Israel adopted its design and entered service later than KJ-2000(service 2004) in 2009. =KJ-3000= A new variant with a claimed fixed next generation radar was spotted in 2013. Operational history The PLAAF's first AWACS regiment was established at a small and remote airfield in southern China, for security reasons, during late 2004. The commander appointed to the regiment was Zhang Guangjian (张广建), a pilot with over 6,000 hours of flight time on various aircraft including the Il-76. The base was re- built and re-equipped for handling the KJ-2000, the first of which reached the base in 2005. A mixed fleet of KJ-2000 and the smaller KJ-200 has been operated at the base. During 2006 a war exercise was held in north west China, during which a KJ-2000 and KJ-200 were deployed from the regiment for evaluation. Finally in 2013 a 24-hour coverage drill was held using three KJ-2000s that covered NW China, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea. Recent satellite photos show eight new Shaanxi KJ-500 airborne early warning and control, or AEW&C; aircraft at the company's factory airfield at Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province in mid-December 2017. The aircraft were undergoing testing before delivery to the military. Satellite imagery released by Stratfor has also revealed the PLAAF has deployed KJ-500s to Lhasa-Gonggar Airport in Tibet. The KJ-500 has a fixed dorsal rotodome containing three radar arrays each containing active electronically scanned array or AESA radars arranged in a triangular configuration to give full 360° coverage. The new radar design supplants the “balance beam” design used on the earlier Shaanxi KJ-200 AEW&C; aircraft. Since IL-76s are supplied by Russia and the quantity is limited, China seeks to replace the IL-76 platform currently used by the KJ-2000 with the Y-20.

The Gateway Program is a C$3.0 billion regional transportation project for Metro Vancouver that is being managed by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation. The ministry introduced the Gateway Program on January 31, 2006, as a means to address growing congestion and reduce travel times. Port Mann / Highway 1 The Port Mann / Highway 1 (PMH1) Project includes the widening of Highway 1, a new Port Mann Bridge, and upgrades to interchanges on British Columbia Highway 1 in order to address congestion through this corridor. The Port Mann Bridge was replaced with a new 10-lane tolled bridge. On September 1, 2017, the toll was removed. The project will also feature rapid bus lanes. This will include transit priority access to Highway 1, park-and-ride facilities, new transit loops in Surrey and Langley, and 20 new buses.http://www.translink.bc.ca/files/buzzer/2007/Buzzer__Oct19.pdf The bridge will include separated pedestrian and cycling lanes and is also designed to accommodate the eventual addition of light rail transit underneath the bridge. The project includes widening Highway 1 between McGill Street in Vancouver and 216 Street in Langley. The pre-design concept included one additional lane in each direction between the Port Mann Bridge and McGill Street. The bridge itself features five new lanes, two reserved for high- occupancy vehicles and commercial vehicles. On the Surrey side, two additional lanes will be built from the bridge to 200 Street, allowing for one HOV lane in each direction. Finally, there will be one additional lane in each direction on the section from 200 to 216 Streets. Interchanges from Vancouver to Langley will also be upgraded to increase interchange capacity and improve safety. The majority of these changes will occur within the existing right of way of Highway 1. The PMH1 project was completed in September 2015. https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/infrastructure/2015/09/port-mann- bridge-project-wraps-up-1010286w Golden Ears Way For info on the Golden Ears Way, see Golden Ears Way. South Fraser Perimeter Road The South Fraser Perimeter Road (SFPR), a new four-lane, 80 km/h (50 mph) highway along the south side of the Fraser River, extends from Highway 17 in southwest Delta to 176 Street in Surrey, with connections to Highways 1, 91, and 99 and to TransLink's new Golden Ears Bridge connector. The SFPR provides a new east–west transportation corridor that connects to the Roberts Bank Superport. The stated goal is to reduce the volume of regional truck traffic on local roads and reduce idling on local roads. The Burns Bog Conservation Society has expressed concerns that the South Fraser Perimeter Road will endanger Burns Bog. Attempts to mitigate these impacts have been made through refinements that occurred as a result of public consultation and the Environmental Assessment process. In response to the mitigation measures proposed, the Environmental Stewardship Branch of Environment Canada wrote that \\"the changes are not sufficient to alleviate its concerns related to the impacts of the Project on Pacific Water Shrew (PWS), hydrology, aerial deposition, and ecological integrity of Burns Bog\\". The Gateway Program says that it is committed to protecting and supporting the restoration of Burns Bog. The SFPR project will be working with the Burns Bog Scientific Advisory Panel to develop systems that will improve the existing drainage and hydrology of the bog. Although the SFPR alignment does not pass through the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area, there is concern that it will affect the surrounding hydrology and have an adverse effect on the Conservancy Area.Burns Bog Conservation Society » Resources » Sustainable Development Strategy It is estimated that over 90 hectares (222 acres) of farmland will also be lost to the project. Concerns have also been expressed about pollution near residential neighborhoods and schools.South Fraser Perimeter Road. Sunburyneighbourhood.ca. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. The Wilderness Committee and other groups have criticized the SFPR, and the Gateway Program in general, for increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In the spring of 2011, a protest camp organized by StopThePave.org and the Council of Canadians occupied a SFPR construction site for almost two weeks. The SFPR was completed and opened to traffic on December 21, 2013 and cost C$1.26 billion. North Fraser Perimeter Road The North Fraser Perimeter Road (NFPR) was promoted as a way to provide a continuous route on the north side of the Fraser River from New Westminster to Maple Ridge. TransLink is responsible for the section between the Queensborough Bridge and the border of Coquitlam. The Gateway portion of this route was to originate from the Bailey bridge across the Brunette River. The one-lane wooden bridge was to be replaced with a new four-lane crossing. The route follows United Boulevard and turns onto the Mary Hill Bypass. East of the new bridge, Lougheed Highway continues east through Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge. The intersection at Harris Road will be converted to a full interchange. =Pitt River Bridge and Mary Hill Interchange= The new Pitt River Bridge is a seven-lane cable-stayed bridge that carries the Lougheed Highway over the Pitt River; it was built between the two swing bridges that previously performed this duty. A new interchange has replaced the at-grade intersection of the Lougheed Highway and the Mary Hill Bypass. The old swing bridges previously accommodated four lanes of traffic, two on each bridge, with a counterflow system for peak hours. The new bridge carries three lanes of general-purpose traffic in each direction, as well as one eastbound lane for slower-moving trucks accessing the Canadian Pacific intermodal yard at Kennedy Road. The new bridge also includes separate pedestrian and cycling walkways. The new bridge is designed to accommodate the addition of light rapid transit. The project is being funded by the federal and provincial governments. As part of its recent Asia–Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative, the Government of Canada committed $90 million to the construction of the new bridge and interchange; the province provided $108 million. The new bridge and interchange were substantially completed by the end of 2009 to coincide with the opening of the Golden Ears Bridge. Criticism David Suzuki speaks at the Global Day of Action on Climate Change in Vancouver. Burnaby city council, Vancouver city council, and directors of the GVRD (now Metro Vancouver) have passed resolutions opposing the Highway 1 portion of the project. Groups opposing the program include the Livable Region Coalition, a group based south of the Fraser called the Gateway 40 Network, a group of urban planners, the Society Promoting Environmental Conservation (SPEC), the Burns Bog Conservation Society, Sunbury Neighbourhood Association, South Fraser Action Networks, Bridgeview Community Action Group, Gateway Sucks, the Council of Canadians, and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee. These groups argue that increasing the highway's capacity will only increase traffic over the span and encourage suburban sprawl. The Livable Region Coalition urged the former Minister of Transportation, Kevin Falcon, to consider more viable solutions to reducing congestion, including more rapid transit and improved bus routes. The David Suzuki Foundation claims the project violates the goals of the Livable Region Strategic Plan and does not consider alternative forms of transportation. The provincial government studies, conducted as part of the environmental assessment process, project an increase of 176,000 tonnes per year in greenhouse gas emissions. An analysis by SPEC found that these studies included emissions in Whatcom County, Washington, when calculating the baseline and left them out when calculating the impact of Gateway. When this is factored in, the studies predict a 31% increase in road emissions. Groups supporting the project include Get Moving BC and the BC Truckers Association.

CIRT was formed to conduct regular patrols of metropolitan Melbourne 24-hours, seven-day-per-week, ready to rapidly respond to incidents in Melbourne, and if necessary, in regional Victoria, by a small team of officers. CIRT has evolved to include conducting planned operations for high risk searches and arrests. History A Critical Incident Response Team member at a siege in Belmont, Geelong on 27 September 2012. In March 2004, the Force Response Unit (FRU) launched the CIRT concept consisting of two teams of officers patrolling in a Van each to provide specialist assistance to general duties police with a primary focus on tactical support and negotiation capabilities supported by a greater range of less-than-lethal options, and as a consequence to relieve the Special Operations Group (SOG), the elite Police Tactical Group of Victoria Police, from attending incidents not within their call out criteria. Prior to the creation of CIRT, the FRU had maintained the negotiator capability for Victoria Police. The CIRT concept was similar to the United Kingdom police armed response vehicle (ARV) that patrols ready to respond to provide specialist assistance. A CIRT unit became known as a Van due to their use of this vehicle similar to use of the acronym ARV. This concept was first considered by Victoria Police during the review of the Special Operations Group as part of Project Beacon conducted in 1995. Each CIRT consisted of a Sergeant and three other officers, one of whom was a trained negotiator. In 2010, three Vans were operated providing a third team. As the CIRT evolved, the Force Response Unit relinquished roles to the Operational Response Unit (ORU) formed in May 2010 including the sub unit Public Order Response Team (PORT) formed in June 2011, to focus on CIRT. Over time, certain less-than-lethal equipment used by CIRT became accessible to general duties police. In 2005, CIRT commenced using Tasers which were later trialled by general duties police in 2010. From 2014 to 2017, Tasers were rolled-out to 37 24-hour police stations in regional Victoria for general duties use. Flammable Oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray was replaced as a consequence of the Taser roll-out to a water based streamer as used by CIRT. OC Foam that had been used by CIRT since inception, and that previously had only been available to general duties officers of the rank of Sergeant or above, was made available to all general duties officers in 2008. In December 2017, CIRT introduced Security Teams to patrol the Melbourne City Centre and also major events, including the use of unmarked vehicles, to enable faster response times in the event of a terrorism incident. The television police drama Rush produced by Network Ten from 2008 to 2011 was inspired by the CIRT concept. Notable incidents include the Bourke Street car attack in January 2017 with CIRT ramming the offender's vehicle and shooting the offender, the shooting of a couple at a fancy dress party at a King Street nightclub in July 2017, the fatal shooting of Mohammed Ibrahim in Kew in March 2020 and the fatal shooting of a male on the Monash Freeway in Dandenong North in May 2020. Role The primary function of CIRT is to provide a rapid specialised response to high risk incidents, such as:- * Sieges * Barricade incidents * Armed offender incidents * Violent confrontations * Suicide interventions * High risk escorts * Chemical, biological, and/or radiological CBR incidents * Cell clearances for violent prisoners The incidents pose a threat to general duties police or are difficult to resolve due to violence or other dangers. Any general duties police supervisor can request assistance from CIRT who rapidly respond if approved by a CIRT supervisor. CIRT has specialised training and is equipped with more \\"less than lethal\\" options to resolve an incident than general duties police. An incident may fall within the call out criteria of the SOG such as a firearms incident. The SOG has significantly higher call-out criteria than a CIRT, such as requiring Senior Commissioned officer approval, and with Vans already patrolling, this enables CIRT to rapidly respond to the incident whilst awaiting SOG arrival with CIRT providing a cordon and containment. On arrival of the SOG, CIRT can provide assistance to the SOG such as perimeter containment. The majority of CIRT deployments are related to mental illness, for example between 2010 and 2011 of the total 685 call outs, 324 of these (47%) were mental illness related, with 29 percent of these mental illness call outs including drug and alcohol use. CIRT also provides close personal protection and the provision of security for protected witnesses. CIRT provides trained and qualified police negotiators and equipment such as for Special Operations Group incidents. Structure The CIRT is part of the Security Services Division of the Transit & Public Safety command within Victoria Police, which also includes the SOG, and has a reported strength of 187 officers, including nine female officers. CIRT has about 50 negotiators who perform this role in addition to general CIRT duties. In 2013, CIRT formed the Tasked Operations team to conduct planned operations for high risk search warrants on premises and high risk arrests below the scope / deployment criteria of the SOG. The Tasked Operations team consisting of 17 officers receives further training completing the Tactical Arrest Options Training (TAOT) to conduct forced entries. Training CIRT has three intakes each year, applicants are required to meet minimum fitness requirements and successfully complete an eight week training course. Once qualified officers have fitness tests every six months. Every six weeks, one week is dedicated to firearms training and conducting exercises. Specialist courses are available to complete including the negotiator course, close personal protection course and tactical arrest options course. Equipment The original CIRT Vans were Mercedes-Benz Sprinters which were later replaced by Volkswagen Transporters. In 2018, CIRT received the SOG's former Lenco BearCat armoured vehicle. CIRT officers have a range of specialised equipment and weapons in their inventory ranging from ballistic and tactical vests, Team Wendy EXFIL helmets, Minuteman ballistic shields, Tasers, bean bag rounds, ferret rounds, gas masks, riot shields, ladders, breaching tools and various Oleoresin capsicum OC delivery systems. Officers are armed with Smith & Wesson M&P; .40 pistols, SIG MCX SBR rifles and shotguns including the Kel-Tec KSG and Remington Model 870. Officers were formerly issued the Heckler & Koch UMP .40 sub-machine gun.

Based on the 1923 novel of the same name by Kenneth Taylor Perkins, the film is a remake of The Unknown Cavalier, a 1926 Ken Maynard Western, with much stock footage from the original. The film was released as The Hawk in the U.K. Plot Lobby card John Drury (John Wayne) is passing through when townsfolk are about to kill Duke, a horse they believe to be dangerous. He convinces them to reprieve the animal if he can ride it. He does, earning the gratitude of Ruth Gaunt (Ruth Hall). He then volunteers to deal with an outlaw known as the Hawk who has been terrorizing the area. Solid citizen Henry Simms (Frank Hagney) volunteers to guide him to the Hawk's territory. But Simms is actually the Hawk and he ties Drury to a tree, leaving him to die. Simms then leads a raid on a ranch, kills a man and plants Drury's harmonica at the scene. With the help of his horse Duke, Drury manages to free himself. However, a group of vigilantes, believing that he is the Hawk, accuse him of murder and take him to face a hanging judge. Fortunately, Ruth shows up, with the news that a wounded witness has regained consciousness and confirmed Drury's claim that Simms is the real bandit. Simms' men burst in and hold everyone at gunpoint. Simms takes Ruth with him to his hideout, but Drury manages to escape and follow them. The posse overpowers Simms' henchmen and captures the rest of the gang. Simms and Drury fight; when Drury is distracted by the arrival of help, Simms knocks him out and tries to flee, only to run into the deadly hooves of an enraged Duke.

P. First (Craig P. First, born March 16, 1960) is an American composer of the avant-garde. He was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Recognized primarily for his chamber music, he has also composed opera, orchestral and electronic music. His music is characterized by its taut, often disturbing drama, and carefully calculated, discordant atonal language.  Biography Whilst still in his early teens, C. P. First began composing works of an experimental nature. After completing his primary education, he pursued composition studies in Chicago, Illinois, where he studied at the American Conservatory, then at the University of Chicago where he studied with the Pulitzer prize-winning composer Shulamit Ran. He earned his Doctoral degree (1990) from Northwestern University.Marquis Who's Who in America During his years as a graduate student, First became deeply entrenched in the electronic and computer media that often reside at the core of his compositional output. Whilst an undergraduate student, First was commissioned by Charles Moore and the ACM Chamber Opera of Chicago to write the one-act opera, The Soul of Rose Dede. His work caught the attention of influential cultural figures in Chicago, including impresario Dalia Kuceanas, who introduced the young composer to important European musicians. These introductions led to the commission of several works, including Two by One (solo violin) for the preeminent Russian violinist, Raimundas Katillus, who performed the composer's music at Carnegie Hall. Immediately following First's Carnegie Hall debut, performances of his works appeared throughout Europe and the major performance centers in the US. Among the important European musicians with whom First came in contact was the brilliant Greek virtuoso Dimitris Marinos. Perhaps First's most well-known work, Tantrum, was written for Marinos, who performed the work widely in Europe and the US, including the World Music Days in England, the World Music Days in Luxembourg, and Carnegie Hall and Merkin Hall. Marinos and First collaborated on two other works, Epiphany and Contrapuntal Variations I commissioned by Commissioning Music/USA. Although in recent years somewhat reclusive, the composer persistently emerges with new works that invariably receive critical acclaim. Most recently, his collaboration with New York filmmaker Matt Marello on the eccentric multi-media collaboration, The Eternal Return (2002), received worldwide attention, including performances on the America in Berlin exhibit at the Berlin Academy of Art. In addition to his work as a composer, First has contributed to the introduction of new works in his service as Artistic Director with the Chicago 21st Century Music Ensemble. Founded in 1992 by First and conductor Gui Bordo, the ensemble remains an important contemporary music group in Chicago. From 1990 until 1995, First served as a Lecturer in Theory and Composition at Northwestern University and DePaul University. In 1995, he accepted a post at the University of Alabama, where he is Professor and Chair of Composition and Theory.http://www.cpfirst.net  Works and honours First's interest in electronic media led to the production of some of his most important and widely performed works, including Tantrum (1992-amplified mandolin and tape), I' vidi in terra angelici (1990-mezzo-soprano and tape) on Petrarch sonnets, and Zu wissen was kein Engel weiss (1990-double orchestra and quadrophonic tape). His most recent music includes The Eternal Return, a multimedia work for five ensembles and five films created by New York filmmaker Matt Marello.

Its purpose is to measure the willingness to risk conflict. An agent will be more willing to risk conflict if it does not have much to lose in case that the negotiation fails. In contrast, an agent is less willing to risk conflict when it has more to lose. The value of a deal is expressed in its utility. An agent has much to lose when the difference between the utility of its current proposal and the conflict deal is high. When both agents use the monotonic concession protocol, the Zeuthen strategy leads them to agree upon a deal in the negotiation set. This set consists of all conflict free deals, which are individually rational and Pareto optimal, and the conflict deal, which maximizes the Nash product. The strategy was introduced in 1930 by the Danish economist Frederik Zeuthen.  Three key questions  The Zeuthen strategy answers three open questions that arise when using the monotonic concession protocol, namely: # Which deal should be proposed at first? # On any given round, who should concede? # In case of a concession, how much should the agent concede? The answer to the first question is that any agent should start with its most preferred deal, because that deal has the highest utility for that agent. The second answer is that the agent with the smallest value of Risk(i,t) concedes, because the agent with the lowest utility for the conflict deal profits most from avoiding conflict. To the third question, the Zeuthen strategy suggests that the conceding agent should concede just enough raise its value of Risk(i,t) just above that of the other agent. This prevents the conceding agent to have to concede again in the next round. Risk : \\\\text{Risk}(i,t)= \\\\begin{cases} 1 & U_{i}(\\\\delta(i,t))=0  \\\\frac{U_{i}(\\\\delta(i,t))-U_{i}(\\\\delta(j,t))}{U_{i}(\\\\delta(i,t))} & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} Risk(i,t) is a measurement of agent i's willingness to risk conflict. The risk function formalizes the notion that an agent's willingness to risk conflict is the ratio of the utility that agent would lose by accepting the other agent's proposal to the utility that agent would lose by causing a conflict. Agent i is said to be using a rational negotiation strategy if at any step t + 1 that agent i sticks to his last proposal, Risk(i,t) > Risk(j,t). Sufficient concession If agent i makes a sufficient concession in the next step, then, assuming that agent j is using a rational negotiation strategy, if agent j does not concede in the next step, he must do so in the step after that. The set of all sufficient concessions of agent i at step t is denoted SC(i, t). Minimal sufficient concession : \\\\delta'=\\\\arg\\\\max_{\\\\delta\\\\in{SC(A,t)}}\\\\\\\\{U_{A}(\\\\delta)\\\\\\\\} is the minimal sufficient concession of agent A in step t. Agent A begins the negotiation by proposing : \\\\delta(A,0)=\\\\arg\\\\max_{\\\\delta\\\\in{NS}}U_{A}(\\\\delta) and will make the minimal sufficient concession in step t + 1 if and only if Risk(A,t) ≤ Risk(B,t). Theorem If both agents are using Zeuthen strategies, then they will agree on : \\\\delta=\\\\arg\\\\max_{\\\\delta'\\\\in{NS}}\\\\\\\\{\\\\pi(\\\\delta')\\\\\\\\}, that is, the deal which maximizes the Nash product. Proof Let δA = δ(A,t). Let δB = δ(B,t). According to the Zeuthen strategy, agent A will concede at step t if and only if : Risk(A,t)\\\\leq Risk(B,t). That is, if and only if : \\\\frac{U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A})-U_{A}(\\\\delta_{B})}{U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A})}\\\\leq \\\\frac{U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B})-U_{B}(\\\\delta_{A})}{U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B})} : U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B})(U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A})-U_{A}(\\\\delta_{B}))\\\\leq U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A})(U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B})-U_{B}(\\\\delta_{A})) : U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A})U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B})-U_{A}(\\\\delta_{B})U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B})\\\\leq U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A})U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B})-U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A})U_{B}(\\\\delta_{A}) : -U_{A}(\\\\delta_{B})U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B})\\\\leq -U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A})U_{B}(\\\\delta_{A}) : U_{A}(\\\\delta_{A}) U_{B}(\\\\delta_{A})\\\\leq U_{A}(\\\\delta_{B}) U_{B}(\\\\delta_{B}) : \\\\pi(\\\\delta_{A})\\\\leq \\\\pi(\\\\delta_{B}) Thus, Agent A will concede if and only if \\\\delta_{A} does not yield the larger product of utilities. Therefore, the Zeuthen strategy guarantees a final agreement that maximizes the Nash Product.

After the release of the Custom Floor record, Swank's other project, Foundation Skateboards, gained some financial momentum, and Goldenrod was put on hold. Swank's friend Mark Waters, an employee at Lou's Records at the time, and also a photographer and writer in the skateboarding world, was looking to start a record label and asked Swank for advice. A partnership was born and the \\"no rules for records\\" idea was spawned. Basically, this meant that if they liked a band, they'd put out a record if they could, without worrying about how many would sell. A long series of releases by primarily San Diego bands followed, and several noteworthy San Diego bands made their debut on Goldenrod Records: No Knife, Heavy Vegetable, Boilermaker, 100 Watt Halo, The Crimson Curse, etc. Other notable bands who released records on Goldenrod include Three Mile Pilot, fluf, Supernova, Tina, Age 13, Big Drill Car, Hemlock, Lucy's Fur Coat, Fishwife, Deadbolt.

She was thus the eldest sister of kings Edward IV (1461–1483) and Richard III (1483–1485); and of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk, Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy and of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. Marriages and issue Anne married twice and divorced her first husband: =First marriage= England, a bordure of France In 1447 aged eight years old, Anne was married to Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter (1430–1475). During the Wars of the Roses Exeter sided with the House of Lancaster against his wife's family the House of York. Exeter was a commander at the great Lancastrian victories at the Battle of Wakefield and Second Battle of St Albans. He was also a commander at the Lancastrian defeat at the Battle of Towton. He fled to the Kingdom of Scotland after the battle, and then joined Margaret of Anjou in her exile in France, queen consort of the Lancastrian King Henry VI. On 4 March 1461 Anne's younger brother Edward, Duke of York, was declared in London as King Edward IV. Exeter was attainted but the new king gave his estates to Anne, with remainder to their daughter Anne Holland. Anne and Exeter separated in 1464 and divorced in 1472. During the Readeption of Henry VI, Anne remained loyal to her brother Edward, and, in what seems to have been her only intervention in politics, worked hard to persuade her brother George, Duke of Clarence, to abandon the Lancastrian cause. If not decisive, her arguments certainly had some effect and thus she played some part in Edward's restoration. By the Duke of Exeter Anne had one daughter, Anne Holland (1461Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 57, f. 2*r – between 26 August 1467 and 6 June 1474), who was married in October 1466 at Greenwich Palace to Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, son of Edward IV's queen Elizabeth Woodville by her first husband. Lady Dorset died sometime between 26 August 1467 and 6 June 1474 without children. Grey subsequently married Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington, another rich young heiress, by whom he had issue.Ross, Charles Derek (1974). Edward IV.

He took part in the Duke of Buckingham's attempted rebellion against King Edward's younger brother and eventual successor King Richard III (1483–1485), on the failure of which he was executed in 1483. King Edward IV had however in 1467 extended the remainder of most of the former Duke of Exeter's lands to the King's sister, Anne, and to any heirs of her body. Thus, if she remarried any future children could inherit them. Anne died giving birth to her only daughter by Thomas, Anne St. Leger (14 January 1476 – 21 April 1526), who due to the special remainder was heiress to the estates of her mother's first husband Henry Holland. She married George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros, and was mother of the royal favourite Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland.

He is considered one of the fathers of Chilean journalism together with Fr. Camilo Henríquez. Irisarri was born in Guatemala City, the son of Juan Bautista de Irisarri and of María de la Paz Alonso. He studied in his native city and in Europe, from whence he was recalled back to his home after the death of his father in 1805. In 1809 he visited Chile, and having married Mercedes Trucíos y Larraín, an heiress there, took up his residence in that country and joined with enthusiasm the movement for independence in 1810. He had charge of important public offices during the struggle for liberty, including the command of the National guard and the civil and military government of the province of Santiago, and from March 7 to 14, 1814, he was temporarily in charge of the supreme direction of the nation. In 1818 he was appointed Minister of Government and Foreign Affairs by Bernardo O'Higgins, and in October of the same year he went to Buenos Aires as minister. At the end of 1819 he was sent to Europe to negotiate the recognition of Chilean Independence by England and France (which he was not able to obtain.) While at London he negotiated a loan of £1,000,000 (the first foreign debt of Chile.) He was sent to Central America in 1827 as minister for Chile, and in 1837 as plenipotentiary to Peru and private adviser to Admiral Manuel Blanco during the War of the Confederation. After the Chilean army was forced to sign the Treaty of Paucarpata on November 17, 1837, the scandal was gigantic. Irisarri refused to return to Chile, was tried in absentia for high treason, and sentence to death. Irisarri wisely never returned to Chile. He was minister of Guatemala and Salvador to Ecuador from 1839 till 1845, and in 1846-1848 to Colombia, but resigned, and went to Curaçao in 1849, and in 1850 to the United States, where he resided till his death. The governments of Guatemala and Salvador appointed him, in 1855, their minister to Washington, and for a long time he was dean of the diplomatic corps. Irisarri continued his literary work in the United States, and was generally esteemed for his knowledge, genial character, and polished manners. Irisarri was chief editor of the Semanario Republicano de Chile in Santiago in 1813; of El Duende in the same city in 1818; of El Censor Americano in London in 1820; of El Guatemalteco in Guatemala in 1828; of \\"La Verdad desnuda,\\" \\"La Balanza,\\" and \\"El Correo\\" in Guayaquil in 1839-1843; of \\"La Concordia\\" in Quito in 1844-1845; of\\" Nosotros,\\" \\"Orden y Libertad,\\" and \\"El Cristiano Errante\\" in Bogota in 1846-1847; and of \\"El Revisor\\" in Curaçao in 1849, the publication of which he continued in New York.

Biography Santiago was formed in 2002 by singer/guitarist Gabe Meline after leaving The Mr. T Experience (he had previously played in Tilt, Ground Round and Los Blockheads). The band quickly recorded the self-released debut Entertainment For Man And Horse, imploding shortly thereafter as lineup changes forced what would be a temporary hiatus. In 2004, the band was resuscitated by Josh Drake, drummer and owner of Pandacide Records, who had released albums by The Velvet Teen and The New Trust. With bassist Kyle Lindauer, the trio wrote and recorded 2006's Rosenberg's After Dark, an album dedicated entirely to the band's hometown of Santa Rosa, California. Named for the long-standing department store that once towered over the city's downtown, the album became a compelling snapshot of the typical American small town-turned-suburb with a fiery resistance to the impending loss of its own culture. In late 2006, Kyle Lindauer suffered ankle injuries and left the band, to be replaced by bassist Tony Moshenelli. \\"The Blue Line\\" EP followed in 2008, a one-sided, silkscreened 12\\" that found the band joined by Lindsay Gray on cello. \\"The Blue Line\\" was available on vinyl only. Santiago's third album, The Illusion of Being Together was released on LP, CD and cassette by Pandacide Records in 2010. Its cover design, lyric insert and packaging mimic the classic Folkways Records style. For the vinyl release, the band recycled 300 old record jackets of soft rock and easy listening artists by painting them black and individually gluing a wrap- around, paste-on slick to each copy.  Special projects  In 2006, Santiago rehearsed and performed the Built to Spill album Perfect from Now On in its entirety with former member Nick Jackson. In 2007, the band helped organize a memorial tribute, to Logan Whitehurst at the Phoenix Theater, rehearsing and collaborating with Whitehurst's many fans to perform over twenty of Whitehurst's songs. The first 50 copies of each vinyl pressing by Santiago feature individually designed handmade covers, by members and friends of the band and usually sell out quickly.

The name Yambuk is an Aboriginal word thought to mean \\"red kangaroo\\", \\"full moon\\" or \\"big water\\". Shell middens in the limestone cliffs to the east of the town indicate that Aboriginal people had lived in the area for at least 2300 years. European settlement took place in the area when Lieutenant Andrew Baxter and his wife Annie Baxter squatted the Yambuck pastoral run in 1843. Annie Baxter's diary notes 13 occasions where European settlers formed armed and mounted hunting parties to attack and harass Gunditjmara people. These events were part of the significant conflict between Aboriginal peoples and Europeans that occurred around Yambuk at the time. Some of the most violent clashes of the western district taking place near the Shaw river and the Eumeralla River. This conflict known as the Eumeralla wars continued from the 1840s to around 1860. The township was established in the 1850s, the Post Office opening 1 March 1859. The town had a population of 267 residents in the , At the , the town and surrounding area had a population of 540.

VAR/40 The VAR/40 is a small landmine, designed to be carried by individual soldiers and hand laid. It was initially produced for the Italian army in the 1970s, and was exported to a large number of countries. The mines body is circular with a ribbed plastic body split into upper and lower halves. The upper half holds the pressure-sensitive fuze mechanism, which is covered by a truncated rubber cone. The fuze is covered by a safety cap that prevents accidental activation. The safety cap also has a threaded well, which holds the detonator during transit. The mine is armed by transferring the detonator from the fuze cap to the well in the base of the mine, the safety cap is then removed. Pressure on the central pressure plate, compresses the spring until the pressure is enough to shear the plastic retaining pins. It is a minimum metal design. It's normally deployed with the main body underground with the raised pressure fuze protruding above ground. The mine can be laid underwater and doesn't float. It is moderately resistant to overpressure due to the small surface area of the pressure fuze. The mine is no longer in production and Italian operational stocks of the mine have been destroyed (a stockpile of 1,420,636 mines).ICBL report 2004 Thailand also held stocks of the mine. It's found in Angola, Iraq and Turkey. VAR/100 The VAR/100 is a larger version of the VAR/40 it uses a larger main charge (100 grams of RDX explosive instead of 40 grams, hence the name of both) but is otherwise identical. The mine is no longer in production, and is found in Mozambique. VAR/100/SP The VAR/100/SP is a VAR/100 mine fitted with a 1.6 kilogram cast iron fragmentation jacket identical to the one used with the AUPS mine. The mine is mounted on an 800 millimeter high stake. On detonation the jacket breaks into approximately 500 fragments with a lethal range of about 25 meters. The fuze is different from the VAR/100 - the SP version uses a three pronged pressure and tilt fuze that can be used with tripwires. The mine is no longer in production.

It tries to ameliorate problems associated with the rigour-relevance debate, and is applicable in all kinds of research streams. Simply put, pragmatic validity looks at research from a prescriptive-driven perspective. Solutions to problems that actually occur in the complex and highly multivariate field of practice are developed in a way that, while valid for a specific situation, need to be adjusted according to the context in which they are to be applied. The term \\"validity\\" is often seen as a sort catch-all for the question whether the knowledge claims resulting from research are warranted. The confusion might arise from the mingling of the terms 'internal validity' and 'external validity', where the former refers to proof of a causal link between a treatment and effect, and the latter is concerned with generalizability. (In this discussion I maintain the term 'generalizability' rather than external validity mainly to avoid any possible confusion between the two terms.) During this discussion I consider that validity is reflected in the question, \\"did we measure the right thing?\\", or, in other words, can the researcher prove that the effect he observed was actually a result of the cause? Positivistic research approaches this question in a different way than pragmatic research, which is based in a different paradigm. Design Science Research is one example of research firmly situated in a pragmatic perspective. Validity in (post)positivist research Postpositivist research typically strives to numerically report upon empirical observations made within a controlled environment in order to arrive at a universal truth about a causal effect between a limited number of variables. This statement relates what much of the epistemology of Positivistic science is based on: isolating singular variables in order to come to a conclusion that is free of context. Laboratory experiments and quantitative models are the preferred methods for observing and reporting. These are considered to rule out any rival plausible explanations and thus help to guarantee validity. Validity in pragmatic research Validity in prescription-driven research is approached in different ways than descriptive research. The first difference deals with what some researchers call 'messy situations' (Brown 1992; Collins, Joseph, and Bielaczuc 2004). A messy situation is a real-life, a highly multivariate one is where independent variables cannot be minimized nor completely accounted for. In explanatory science, experiments are in controlled laboratories, where variables can be minimalized. The complex nature of a real-life intervention means that the success or failure (effect) of the intervention may be difficult to conclusively link to the intervention itself (cause). This aspect of knowledge claims from science is seen as extremely problematic for positivist scientists looking for explanations. However, scientists using a pragmatic paradigm respond to this concept in two ways; first by questioning the value of research carried out in a controlled situation (Brown 1992; Hodkinson 2004; Kelly and Lesh 2000; Perrin 2000; Susman and Evered 1978; Walker and Evers 1999; Zaritsky et al. 2003) and secondly, by looking at causal effects through a different perspective. The use of the phrase of Pragmatic Validity was first discussed in Worren, Moore & Elliott (2002), who contrasted it with Scientific Validity. This ideas has been taken up in the management literature to a considerable degree. Many social science researchers assert that testing interventions in controlled laboratory settings is hardly feasible and not a reflection of the real world.Brown 1992; Cook 1983; Husen 1999 For them, real-life settings are needed in order to produce worthwhile research artifacts. These artifacts are validated by the adoption rate of the practitioners within the community of practice associated with the field.Brown 1992; Hodkinson 2004; Zaritsky et al. 2003 Nowotny (2000) calls knowledge that has been validated by the multidisciplinary community of practice 'socially robust', meaning that it has been developed in (and for) contexts outside the laboratory and can be used by practitioners. In the following statement, Cook (1983) refers to the well- known educational researcher Cronbach about multivariate causal interdependency and validity, and the need for understanding the complexity of the situation being researched. > Lawful statements of causation require full knowledge of this system of > variables so that total prediction of the outcome can be achieved. From his > belief in the systemic organization of causal connections and the utility of > causal explanations of this type, Cronbach questions whether the > experimentalists' isolation and manipulation of a small set of specific > causal agents is sensitive to the real nature of causal agency, which > depends on complex patterns of influence between multiple events and also > involves characteristics of respondents, settings and times (p.78). Thus, Cook (1983) actually questions the validity of causal explanations generated in a context-free setting (the goal of positivistic, explanatory research). Causal relationships in pragmatic research are looked at somewhat differently, which is apparent in the wording alone. A statement about a causal relationship in positivistic research is something like the following; if you perform action x to subject y, then z happens. This assumes that the confounding variables have been ruled out, and the statement is always true, regardless of the situation (internally and externally valid). What I want to do now is use the concept of 'technological rules' in order to illustrate how causality is shown in prescriptive. In pragmatic science, the goal is to develop knowledge that can be used to improve a situation. This we can call prescriptive knowledge. Prescriptive knowledge, according to van Aken (2004, 2004b, 2005) can take the form of a technological rule. A technological rule is \\"... a chunk of general knowledge linking an intervention or artifact with an expected outcome or performance in a certain field of application\\" (van Aken, 2005: p23). This rule can be formulated much the same way as my earlier example of a causal statement; 'if you perform action X to subject Y, then Z happens' (Note the cause and effect formulation). This type of algorithmic formulation is called a design solution (vanAken and Romme 2005). A design solution is usually a statistically proven quantitative model that can be taken as specific instruction (van Aken & Romme, 2005). On the other hand, there are more abstract technological rules that are used for designing solutions. These are heuristics that guide, but do not determine, the design process and are called design solutions (van Aken 2005; van Aken and Romme 2005). Design solutions are formulated in the following way; \\" If you want to achieve Y in situation Z, then you perform something like X\\" (van Aken & Romme, 2005; p. 6). In short, the resulting artifacts of pragmatic research can also be causal relationships, just typically not as specific or reductionist as those resulting from positivist research. The words 'something like' in the statement implicitly refer to the complexity in which the causal relationship is enacted. The causal agent (X, in the statement above) can also be seen as complex and multivariate (Cook, 1983). Testing these causal agents is done in context, much the same way as evaluation research tests social or economic programs (van Aken 2003) .

Spike (who goes by different names in a few episodes - Killer for four episodes, Butch for two episodes, and Bulldog for one) is portrayed as an American bulldog, who is generally friendly and amiable, and a loving father to his son Tyke in several episodes. However, Spike's character also has a very stern, and fierce side, for occasions such as when he is defending his son Tyke. Spike made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble, and his first speaking role was in The Bodyguard (1944), where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher. Spike was voiced by Bletcher until 1949, from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler, with a thick New Yorker accent similar to Jimmy Durante's. After Dog Trouble, Spike appeared as a solo guest in Tom and Jerry cartoons for the next several years; his son Tyke was introduced in 1949, with Love That Pup. Tyke is a sweet, happy and innocent puppy, who doesn't speak for most of the earlier installments. Spike and Tyke's characters, provide a model of father and son behavior, with Spike spending much of his free time taking Tyke on father-son outings, teaching him the facts of life for dogs and guarding him diligently when they are sleeping. In Tom and Jerry Kids, Tyke has a speaking role for the first time, aside from traditional dog noises he expressed in the prior films. Spike's relationships with Tom and Jerry have varied from time to time, but essentially Spike has little affection for Tom Cat, who seems always to be disrupting his life, causing trouble, antagonizing Tyke or all of the above. The Truce Hurts (1948), Pet Peeve (1954) and Hic-Cup Pup (1954) are so far the only cartoons where Spike actually cares about and shows affection for Tom; these relationships often dissolve and usually end with them fighting. Tom does not usually antagonize Spike intentionally, but Spike often ends up in the middle of a Tom and Jerry chase, (as they are all seemingly living together) which ends up waking Spike up, ruining his new dog house, wrecking his and Tyke's picnic, and so on. Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon: his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness. Spike's fiercest behavior is reserved for anyone who interferes with Tyke, but also, Spike's generally well-intentioned brain is at times easily outwitted by Tom and/or Jerry. Jerry also arranges to get Tom in trouble with Spike, provoking a chase, and/or a pounding from the bulldog. and Spike will keep Tom's attention off Jerry for a while. Several stories also have Jerry taking advantage of Spike and Tyke's size and proximity, as he often tries to hide or sleep with or near Spike and Tyke for protection. Early appearances In his first appearance, Dog Trouble, Spike is the main antagonist, chasing and attacking both Tom and Jerry on sight, even trying to eat Jerry, which forced the two to work together to defeat him. However, in his next appearance The Bodyguard, after Jerry willingly saved him from being poached, he became Jerry's protector whenever needed. In all subsequent shorts, Spike becomes typecast as the stereotypical dumb brute who is always duped into becoming a shield for Jerry from Tom. It is only in two episodes where Jerry gets Spike out of a jam and the dog willingly protects him from Tom in well-earned gratitude (The Bodyguard and Fit to Be Tied). On most occasions, Jerry causes trouble for Tom by luring him near Spike and harming him to get him angry, and in some cartoons when it's perfectly obvious that Tom is not responsible, as seen in The Invisible Mouse, Spike still blames Tom and hurts him instead of Jerry. Only on one occasion does Jerry fail to frame Tom, in Hic-Cup Pup where Tom unintentionally cures Spike and Tyke's hiccups, and Spike shakes Tom's hand. Spike, however, is not without a softer and sympathetic side: in the episode Pet Peeve, after believing that Tom is willing to leave the house in Spike's favour, Spike feels sorry for him to the point that he offers to leave instead, which Spike does until he realises that Tom is only using reverse psychology to trick him into leaving. In The Truce Hurts, Spike is portrayed as a very intelligent and equilibrated character when he convinces Tom and Jerry to stop the fighting among the three of them and sign a Peace Treaty, but their newfound friendship comes to an end when they argue over how to share a big steak, symbolised when Spike tears the truce contract to shreds and they go back to fighting again after Tom accidentally threw the steak into the sewer drain. From the 1944 cartoon The Bodyguard to 1948 cartoon Heavenly Puss, he was voiced by Billy Bletcher. His first name is Bulldog in Dog Trouble, His name also varies in some shorts: in Puttin' on the Dog, Solid Serenade and Cat Fishin' he is named \\"Killer\\", and in The Truce Hurts he signs his name \\"Butch\\" on the treaty peace paper. He is also a Devil Dog in Heavenly Puss. Spike's later years and Tyke's debut In Tom's later attempts to catch Jerry, he has to deal with Spike for bothering his son. In 1949's Love That Pup, Spike was given a puppy son, Tyke, who became another popular supporting character in the Tom and Jerry cartoons. His voice was taken over by Daws Butler, who styled Spike's voice after Jimmy Durante taking after his 1940s radio series with Garry Moore. He is named Spike from then on and is not changed again. When Tyke is introduced, Spike is given a softer approach (mainly towards his son) and is kinder and less aggressive, but is still portrayed as a dumb animal on more than one occasion. Spike's love and affection towards Tyke becomes Jerry's newest weapon against Tom, as his strategy goes from luring Tom towards Spike to inflicting harm on Tyke, and even when it is perfectly obvious that Jerry is responsible and not Tom, as seen in Love That Pup. Spike fails to notice this and still blames Tom (although this can be partially due to Spike's dislike of Tom). A short-lived Spike and Tyke cartoon series was produced by MGM in 1957; only two entries were completed. Within a year, the MGM cartoon studio had shut down, and Hanna and Barbera took Spike and Tyke and retooled them to create one of the first television successes for Hanna-Barbera Productions, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy. Spike and Tyke would not appear in new Tom and Jerry cartoons, until the 1970s The Tom and Jerry Show, the 1980s The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show, and 1990's Tom & Jerry Kids (in which Tom and Jerry themselves were made younger, but Spike and Tyke remained the same ages, and appeared both with Tom and Jerry, and in new episodes of their own with a girlfriend for Tyke). He had also made a cameo in the 1967 MGM Animation/Visual Arts production Matinee Mouse, which reused footage from Love that Pup and The Truce Hurts, and added some new animation in the final punchline. Spike would continue to appear in Tom and Jerry full-length features released in the early 2000s and finally, Tom and Jerry Tales. Spike made a cameo appearance in the final scene of Who Framed Roger Rabbit with other famous cartoon characters. Spike and his son Tyke also appear as regulars in the recent reboot series. Comics appearances Spike and Tyke made frequent appearances in the second Tom and Jerry daily newspaper strip, which was distributed by Editors Press Service from about 1974 until 1998. The strip was produced in the US, but only appeared in foreign newspapers. Spike and Tyke starred in a long series of comic book stories in Dell Publishing's Tom and Jerry Comics, starting with #79 (Feb 1951) until #215 (May 1963). They also appeared in three issues of Dell's Four Color series between 1953 and 1955. Unlike their portrayal in the cartoons, both characters spoke in the comic book stories.

Plot  One sunny day, a young boy named Jo-kang meets a curious young girl dressed in a bright yellow raincoat. She tells everyone in school that she is an alien and whomever she touches will be harmed. Everyone in that school becomes afraid of her, except Jo-kang. Jo-kang befriends the girl, Ari, and falls instantly in love with her. The quirky Ari loves telling Jo-kang stories, and he believes everything she says and is willing to do anything for her. After he and Ari huddle together beneath her yellow raincoat one rainy day, Jo-kang becomes sick with measles. Soon afterwards, she disappears. Ten years later, Ari contacts Jo-kang, now in high school, and asks to meet again. Although they have not seen each other in a decade, they have a wonderful time together, and their love begins anew. Ari tells him that she lives at a temple on a mountain that's actually a volcano, and that hot springs surround it. Jo- kang believes her when she tells him that her English got better after she was given lessons by an English ghost who visits her when she's naked. She also tells him that she plans to marry a banker so that she'll be able to rob his bank and leave the planet. Jo-kang travels all night to bring Ari her favorite dish from his home, presenting it to her as a surprise the next morning. She kisses him and Jo-kang catches the flu. Then Ari disappears once more, leaving Jo-kang devastated. Jo-kang becomes an adult, and one day Ari appears again in front of him and tells him to come with her. At first he ties her leg to a chair with shoelaces so she can't get away. Later that evening at his home, Ari explains to Jo-kang's father, a sushi chef, that people from NASA kidnapped her since the magnetic force in her body attracts the UFOs. Jo-kang makes plans for the next day, but Ari tells him that she is leaving for the States. Upon leaving, Ari reminds Jo-kang not to cross the line she drew on the ground, something she constantly told him in their childhood. One of Jo- kang's friends gets into an accident and when Jo-kang visits his friend at the hospital, he sees Ari there as a patient. Filled with pain and confusion, Jo- kang visits Ari's uncle, a monk, and pours gasoline on himself, threatening to set himself on fire unless he learns the truth. He discovers that Ari is suffering from HIV/AIDS that was accidentally transmitted to her at a hospital where she was taken after an accident that caused the death of her father. Jo- kang goes to an exhibit where Ari's photographs are displayed, and afterwards he piggybacks her to a grassy lawn where she explains that crop circles are signs left by a UFO. Later that night, Ari falls sick and is admitted back to the hospital. Jo-kang stands outside the hospital, getting wet in the rain. But when Ari's uncle tells him to come inside, Jo-kang replies that he's obeying Ari's instruction not to cross her line on the ground. Jo draws designs on the grassy lawn, and takes Ari there against doctor's orders, telling her to fulfill her destiny to leave the planet. Ari passes the last moments of her life telling Jo-kang that she loves and pities him for believing everything she said. Jo-kang then sees a flying saucer appear in the night sky, signifying Ari's death. In the final scene, Jo-kang goes on with his life, narrating in voice-over that the scent of love that Ari left still lingers. He prefers to believe that she's living on another planet, waiting for the day that they will meet each other again.

The shoe was originally released as a low-top version of the Pro Model basketball shoe. Nicknamed the \\"clamtoe\\", \\"shelltoe\\", \\"shell shoes\\", \\"shell tops\\", and \\"sea shells\\" (along with Adicolours) the iconic design is known as one of the major influences in the sneaker culture. History When the shoe was introduced, it was the first low-top basketball shoe to feature an all-leather upper and the now famous rubber shelltoe. With its rubber toe protection and non-marking sole, the shoe caught the attention of some of the best players from the NCAA and NBA, most notably Kareem Abdul- Jabbar. Within the first few years of its introduction, the Superstar was being worn by over 75% of all NBA players; proof of its revolutionary technology which remains today. Over the course of the next few years, it would advance from the court to the streets and, consequently, further into the public's consciousness. In 1983, from Hollis, Queens, came Run-D.M.C., a rap group that refused to conform to pop standards by deciding that they would dress on stage the way they dressed on the streets. The trio was most notable for wearing the Superstars without any laces and pushing the tongue of the shoe out. \\"Adidas itself only found out about this love story when the band held up the 3-Stripes shoes during a concert in front of 40.000 fans – one of these concertgoers was an adidas employee\\" The Superstar received a lot of promotion from the rap group as they went out on tours across the US, which increased sales of the Superstar shoe. Responding to an anti-sneaker rap song by Jerrald Deas called \\"Felon Sneakers\\", the trio released a song of their own called \\"My Adidas\\" in 1986. The song paid tribute to the Superstar shoe, and attempted to flip the stereotype of the 'b-boy'. Many years later, Adidas eventually signed an advertising deal with the group. The deal made between Run-D.M.C. and Adidas was the first endorsement deal between hip-hop artists and a major corporation, and a Run-D.M.C. endorsed line of clothing from Adidas was subsequently released. The Superstar shoe has become part of popular youth fashion culture and are now worn regularly as casual footwear, rather than for sports. The Superstars, like the Converse Chuck Taylor All- Stars, easily made the transition from the basketball court to street as it was sported by hip-hop aficionados. In the early 1980s, 'b-boys' wore the shoes with extra thick laces called \\"fat laces\\", usually matching the color of the laces with the color of the three stripes on their shoe. The Superstars (now known officially as the \\"Superstar II\\" as the current production shape differs from the original) are now being sold in Adidas Originals stores, with brand new colorways and designs as a fashion shoe with themes such as NBA teams and major US cities. =35th Anniversary Series= In 2005, Adidas celebrated the 35th anniversary of the Superstar by collaborating with icons from the world of music, fashion and arts to create the Adidas 35th Anniversary collection. The collection included 35 different models from 5 different series.

It affects about 5-10% of all women within a year after giving birth. The first phase is typically hyperthyroidism. Then, the thyroid either returns to normal or a woman develops hypothyroidism. Of those women who experience hypothyroidism associated with postpartum thyroiditis, one in five will develop permanent hypothyroidism requiring lifelong treatment. Postpartum thyroiditis is believed to result from the modifications to the immune system necessary in pregnancy, and histologically is a subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis. The process is normally self-limiting, but when conventional antibodies are found there is a high chance of this proceeding to permanent hypothyroidism. Postpartum thyroiditis is a member of the group of thyroiditis conditions known as resolving thyroiditis. Signs and symptoms The initial phase of hyperthyroid symptoms occurs transiently about two to six months postpartum. Typical symptoms include irritability, nervousness, palpitations, and heat intolerance. Hormonal disturbances during this phase tend to occur with lower intensity compared with the hypothyroid phase. As a result, the hyperthyroid phase may pass undetected. The second phase of hypothyroid symptoms is also transient and can occur anytime within the three- to twelve-month period postpartum. Women in this phase experience low energy, poor memory, impaired concentration, carelessness, dry skin, cold intolerance, and general aches and pains. After one year postpartum, euthyroid function resumes. Any case with hypothyroid symptoms extending beyond one year postpartum is not considered postpartum thyroiditis. Women who test positive for thyroid antibodies may be at increased risk of developing symptoms associated with postpartum depression than women without thyroid antibodies. Cause During pregnancy, immunologic suppression occurs which induces tolerance to the presence of the fetus.Premawardhana, L.D.K.E., Parkes, A.B., & Lazarus, J.H. (2004). Thyroiditis, postpartum. In Editor-in-Chief: Luciano Martini (Ed.), Encyclopedia of endocrine diseases (pp. 509-514). New York: Elsevier. Without this suppression, the fetus would be rejected causing miscarriage. As a result, following delivery, the immune system rebounds causing levels of thyroids antibodies to rise in susceptible women.Stagnaro- Green, A. (2000). Recognizing, understanding, and treating postpartum thyroiditis. Endocrinology & Metabolism Clinics of North America, 29(2), 417-430. Specifically, the immunohistological features of susceptible women are indicated by: *antibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) *antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) *increase in TPOAb subclasses IgG1-IgG3 *lymphocyte infiltration and follicle formation within thyroid gland (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) *T-cell changes (increased CD4:CD8 ratio) * TSH-receptor antibodies (TSH-R Abs) Diagnosis This condition is commonly undiagnosed by physicians due to either unfamiliarity with the disease, the subtlety of symptoms, or the attribution of the symptoms to the stresses of having a newborn. Usual screening begins with assessing the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level. A suppressed TSH could represent the hyperthyroid phase, but warrants further testing to investigate for possible Graves' disease. A normal TSH with persistent symptoms could represent the shift between phases and requires repeat testing 4–6 weeks later; an elevated TSH at this time could indicate the hypothyroid phase. Treatment For most women, the hyperthyroid phase presents with very mild symptoms or is asymptomatic; intervention is usually not required. If symptomatic cases require treatment, a short course of beta-blockers would be effective. Assessing treatment for the hypothyroid is more complex. Women with symptoms or a very high TSH level, or both, are usually prescribed a course of levothyroxine. Asymptomatic women with slightly elevated TSH levels who are planning subsequent pregnancies, should consider a course of treatment until completion of the family to avoid possible developmental complications in future children. Otherwise, treatment could be discontinued after 1 year postpartum. Prevalence On average, 5-7% of pregnant women from most iodine-replete populations develop this condition. Women with type I diabetes mellitus have a threefold increase in the prevalence of postpartum thyroiditis than non-diabetic women in the same region.

Plot summary The struggle in Rome continues as Octavian, the new Caesar, with his army at the city's borders, establishes himself as consul to the senate with the reluctant help of Cicero. Meanwhile, Vorenus returns to Rome with his rescued children. Secretly, the children wish to run away. The children steal some of Vorenus' money and run off to their aunt Lyde who insists that they return to their father and, at least, pretend to love and forgive him even after what he has done to their mother. Vorenus makes peace with his rival gangs at a great loss, but informs Pullo that even though the others may think they're \\"going soft\\", they will rebuild their forces. At an orgy, Agrippa abducts Octavia and returns her home to Atia. After Atia fumes at Octavia for going to an orgy, Agrippa confesses his love for Octavia who is stunned as he walks out. Octavian, who had promised to heed Cicero's advice as consul, uses intimidation to pass a motion in the Senate declaring Brutus and Cassius enemies of the state. Cicero, mortified by Octavian's tactics and the fact he has, in his own words \\"been outmaneuvered by a child\\", sends a letter to Brutus, asking for help. In the east, Brutus is encouraged by the news, and plans to take advantage of the conflict between Mark Antony and Octavian by letting them fight it out, and then returning to Rome just as their forces have dwindled. Cicero tells Octavian that Brutus is coming to Rome with \\"20 legions\\", which puts Octavian, who is left with 4 legions, in a dangerous position. Octavian must turn to his mother for help. Atia, accompanied by her son and his army, rides to Gaul, where she greets Mark Antony. She succeeds in convincing Mark Antony to become Octavian's ally, to ensure that they can defeat Brutus' approaching army. Titus Pullo swears to his wife, Eirene, who feels Pullo values his friendship with Vorenus over their marriage, that he would save her before Vorenus. As the friends and children sit down for dinner, Vorenus' eldest daughter Vorena gives out stew and thanks her father for his compliments. As the camera pans downward, we see her making the Corna (the \\"horns\\" hand gesture) behind her back, revealing her dishonesty.

Dimension Films, 410 F.3d 792 (6th Cir. 2005), is a court case that has proved important in defining American copyright law for recorded music. The case centered on N.W.A.’s song \\"100 Miles and Runnin'\\" and Funkadelic's \\"Get Off Your Ass and Jam\\". Essentially, N.W.A. sampled a two- second guitar chord from Funkadelic's tune, lowered the pitch and looped it five times in their song. This was all done without Funkadelic's permission and with no compensation paid to Bridgeport Music, which claims to own the rights to Funkadelic's music. Bridgeport brought the issue before a federal judge, who ruled that the incident was not in violation of copyright law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the decision and ruled that the sampling was in violation of copyright law. Their argument was that with a sound recording, an owner of the copyright on a work had exclusive right to duplicate the work. Under this interpretation of the copyright law, usage of any section of a work, regardless of length, would be in violation of copyright unless the copyright owner gave permission. In its decision, the court wrote: \\"Get a license or do not sample. We do not see this as stifling creativity in any significant way.\\" This decision effectively eliminates the de minimis doctrine for digitally sampling recorded music in the Sixth Circuit, and has affected industry practice. However, the court expressly noted that the decision did not preclude the availability of other defenses, such as fair use, even in the context of \\"sampling.\\" Thus, in the Sixth Circuit, defendants who digitally sampled may not rely on the de minimis doctrine to say that they copied such a small amount that they are not liable for copyright infringement. However, they may still argue that their use of the sample is a fair use—that is, that the use is transformative, for noncommercial purpose, copied only a small amount, the original had a thin copyright, or the copying did not harm the market for the original work or its derivatives.  Influence of the case  New York University musicologist and sampling expert Lawrence Ferrara describes the effects of the Bridgeport case on sample-based music as, \\"extremely chilling, because it basically says that whatever you sample has to be licensed, in its most extreme interpretation.\\"McLeod and DiCola. Creative License: The Law and Culture of Digital Sampling. p. 143. The case has also been influential in the rest of the world: on November 20, 2008, the electronic pioneers Kraftwerk were successful in a landmark case \\"Metall Auf Metall\\" in the Federal Court of Justice of Germany (Bundesgerichtshof, abbreviated BGH), which quotes Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films and decided that even the smallest shreds of sounds are copyrightable and that the sampling of a drum beat can be copyright infringement. Under German law, however, this result is de lege lata—applicable only to that case. The BGH only mentioned the Bridgeport case without discussing it.For a comparison of Bridgeport and Metall auf Metall see ; Apel, Simon, Der ausübende Musiker im Recht Deutschlands und der USA, pp. 299 et seq., 311 et seq. (Mohr Siebeck:Tübingen 2011) and In the United States, the case has been less favorably received. Most recently and significantly, the Ninth Circuit rejected its reasoning explicitly in the 2016 VMG Salsoul v Ciccone (Madonna) case: \\"We recognize that the Sixth Circuit held to the contrary in Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films, 410 F.3d 792 (6th Cir. 2005), but—like the leading copyright treatise and several district courts—we find Bridgeport’s reasoning unpersuasive.\\"VMG Salsoul v. Ciccone, 9th Cir.

He was born in Santiago, the son of Antonio José de Irisarri Alonso and of Mercedes Trucíos y Larraín. He studied at the National Institute. But he did not stay there for long, opting instead to leave the environment of the classroom for the world of writing. Career He began his career as a public writer in \\" El Seminario,\\" of Santiago in 1840, and was a contributor in prose and verse to a number of the literary papers and magazines of Chile. He was one of the stalwarts of the literary movement of 1842. In 1847, he wrote the play El Comercio. The following year he began contributing to The Journal of Santiago, frequently publishing poems in it. He was the director of the biographical work \\"Galeria de hombres celebres de Chile.\\" In 1857 he was elected deputy to the National congress. In 1860 he was honored by the five Central American republics with the appointment as their representative in Chile, and in 1863 went in that capacity to Peru, where for some time he was editor of the political paper \\"El Heraldo de Lima.\\" In 1866 he returned to Chile, and in the same year was elected deputy and vice president of congress. President José Joaquín Pérez invited him several times to take a seat in his cabinet, but he declined. He was elected to the senate in 1873, but took no active part in politics.

She was the first large ocean liner to be built of steel instead of iron, and the first Cunard ship to have an electric lighting installation. For these and other reasons, maritime historians often consider Servia to be the first \\"modern\\" ocean liner.  Background  Servia underway In 1878, Samuel Cunard's British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was reorganised into limited company and officially named Cunard. This capitalisation allowed it to use shareholder money to build larger, more expensive ships. A new policy to this end was put into effect by Cunard's new chairman, John Burns, and announced in the London Times. Launched on 1 March 1881, Servia was the first of Cunard's new breed of ocean liners. She was the second largest ship in the world at 515 feet long and 52.1 feet wide, surpassed only by Brunel's SS Great Eastern. With her design and construction guided by admiralty specifications, Servia had many features that satisfied the requirements for her to be placed high on the admiralty's reserve list of the armed auxiliary cruisers, where she could be called into service in times of war. It was named after historical English name for country Serbia. Power plant Servia’s engine was similar to the one installed on the Guion Line’s crack passenger liner SS Alaska of 1881. It was a triple-crank compound steam engine with one 72 in high-pressure cylinder, and two 100 in low-pressure cylinders, and a stroke of . The steam was supplied at 90 lbf by seven Scotch boilers, each of which were in diameter and contained six furnaces. Six of these boilers were double-ended, while the seventh was single-ended and contained three furnaces. The power developed was 10,300 ihp, driving a single four-bladed screw. Servia's maximum recorded speed during her trials was 17.85 knots, and her average speed during a crossing was around 16 knots. Although Servia did not achieve any speed records, she was a competitive liner that performed well, and in 1884 she managed to make a crossing in less than seven days, averaging at 16.7 knots. Notable features Servia differed from earlier Atlantic liners in a number of significant ways, but most notably, she was the first liner to specialise in passenger transportation, due to her cargo space being sacrificed for her large power-plant. This sacrifice was viable because at that time, tramp steamers had taken over much of the freight across the Atlantic, while the demand for passenger transportation had increased. Because of her passenger specialisation, Servia is considered to be first liner of what became known as the Express Transatlantic Service. Servia also had a number of innovative technical features which are noteworthy in the history of ocean-going liners. The following list is a summary of those features: =Construction and design= Servia was the first major ocean liner to be built of steel, which gave her large hull the advantage of additional strength while at the same time making her lighter. She was also the first liner to re-introduce the cellular double-bottom design which Brunel had invented 20 years earlier for the Great Eastern. The double-bottom was 4' 8\\" deep, and could be flooded with 800 tons of water ballast. Because Servia was built to admiralty specifications, she incorporated several safety features, the most notable being the sub-division of her hull into 12 transverse water-tight compartments, fitted with water-tight doors. She could remain afloat with any two of these compartments flooded. The water-tight doors between the boiler and engine room were fail-safe and could be closed from any deck. =Electric lighting= The first application of electrical lighting on a passenger ship occurred around 1879, with the installation of a small but practical electric lighting installation had been made on the Inman liner City of Berlin. However, a larger more extensive installation aboard the American coastal liner Columbia performed by Thomas Edison the following year, became the first commercial and practical application of electric lighting at sea.Jehl, Francis Menlo Park reminiscences : written in Edison's restored Menlo Park laboratory, Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Whitefish, Mass, Kessinger Publishing, 1 July 2002, page 564 Where City of Berlin had a total of six incandescent lamps installed within the dining hall, boiler rooms and engine room, the installation aboard the Columbia consisted of 200 incandescent lamps fitted within the main saloon and 120 first class staterooms. The Columbia's installation included a small number of extra lamps within the engine room as well. Upon her completion in 1881, the Servia became the first Cunarder to introduce electric lighting, using incandescent lamps. Much like the previous installations aboard the Columbia and City of Berlin, the lamps were installed in the public rooms and engineering spaces aboard the Servia. In total, the Servia utilized a total of 119 incandescent bulbs, which consisted of 117 Swan lamps and two arc lamps. The installation also included a Siemens built dynamo which fed direct current electricity to an electromagnetic inverter operaing at 650 revolutions per minute. Both the dynamo and inverter were located in a secluded area of the Servia's engine room. The inverter in turn supplied alternating current electricity directly to the incandescent lamps through four independent circuits. The majority of lamps were located in the saloon, ladies' room, the boiler rooms, the engine room and smoke room among other areas of the ship. Two lamps were also utilized on deck to aid the loading and unloading of cargo from the vessel. Installation of the electrical lighting system was performed by the Edison and Swan Electric Light Company. In addition to the incandescent lamps, Servia was also fitted with a new type of compass and deep-sea sounding device. =Passenger accommodation= Servia had public rooms of a scale and luxury greater than previously known. Of the three decks, the upper deck consisted of deck-houses that included a first-class smoking room, and a luxuriously fitted ladies drawing room and a music room. The entrance and grand staircase was the largest that had ever appeared on a liner, and was panelled in polished maple and ash. It led down to the a landing on the main deck which featured a library. Twenty-four first-class staterooms were situated aft of this landing, while the first-class dining salon was situated forward. The dining salon could sit 220 of Servia's 480 first-class passengers on five long tables, and was richly decorated with carved panels and carpets. In the centre was an open well that rose 17 ft to a skylight. Forward of the dining salon were a further 58 staterooms, followed by crew accommodation areas. On the lower deck was a servants dining room and a further 82 first-class staterooms. The forward section of this deck was reserved for 730 steerage passengers. This section was a large area of about 150 feet long, and included a dining area. The berths were grouped into separate male and female areas. Fate With the appearance of the crack Cunard liners and in 1893, Servia was relegated to intermediate service. She was later used to transport troops to South Africa during the Boer war. She was broken up in 1902 by Thos W Ward. Notable passengers Writers Jane Addams and Henry James both sailed on a crossing aboard Servia in August 1883, though it does not appear they met. Edward Pellew, 4th Viscount Exmouth, and Viscountess Exmouth sailed aboard the Servia leaving New York City for Liverpool on 1 October 1884.

The custom of hawking led many vendors to create custom melodic phrases. During the 18th and 19th century, the street cries of major urban centers became one of the distinctive features of city life. Street cries became popular subject matter for poets, musicians, artists and writers of the period. Many of these street cries were catalogued in large collections or incorporated into larger musical works, preserving them from oblivion. History Pottery seller, from a series of the \\"Cries of Naples\\" in Capodimonte porcelain, c. 1745 Street vendors and their cries were known in the medieval period. However, the numbers of street vendors working in urban areas increased markedly from the 17th century. In London, street vendors began to fill the streets in the decades following the Great Fire when a major rebuilding programme led to the removal of London's main produce market, Stocks Market, in 1773. The displacement of the open market prompted large numbers of street vendors and itinerant traders to fill the gap in food distribution by providing inexpensive produce in small quantities to the working classes, who for their part, worked long hours in arduous occupations leaving them no time to attend markets situated away from the city centre. This led to a large increase in the informal and unregulated trade carried out by street vendors. The number of street vendors increased again in the early 18th century, following the industrial revolution, as many dislocated workers gravitated to the larger urban centres in search of work. As the city population increased, the number of street vendors also increased.Jones, P. T. A., \\"Redressing Reform Narratives: Victorian London's Street Markets and the Informal Supply Lines of Urban Modernity,\\" The London Journal, Vol 41, No. 1, 2006, pp 64–65 Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the streets of London filled with street vendors, stimulating intense competition between them.Kelley, V., \\"The Streets for the People: London's Street Markets 1850–1939, Urban History, June, 2015, pp. 1–21, To stand out amid the crowd, street vendors began to develop distinctive, melodic cries. Around the same time, these criers or street vendors filled the streets of other European cities including Paris, Bologna and Cologne.Harrison, G., \\"Review: The Criers and Hawkers of London: Engravings and Drawings by Marcellus Laroon by Sean Shesgreen\\", Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 54, No. 1 (Winter, 1991), pp. 79–84 The 19th century social commentator Henry Mayhew describes a Saturday night in the New Cut, a street in Lambeth, south of the river; > Lit by a host of lights … the Cut was packed from wall to wall… The hubbub > was deafening, the traders all crying their wares with the full force of > their lungs against the background din of a horde of street > musicians.Mayhew, Henry, 1851–1861 cited in London Labour and the London > Poor, Researched and written, variously, with J.

Each trade developed its own unique type of street cry; a distinctive set of words or a unique tune.Boutin, A., City of Noise: Sound and Nineteenth-Century Paris, University of Illinois Press, 2015, p. 35 This operated as a means of identifying each type of seller and the goods sold, giving each trade its own \\"verbal and aural space\\".Butterfield, A., The Familiar Enemy: Chaucer, Language, and Nation in the Hundred Years War, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 216 During the 19th century, street traders came under increasing attack from the clergy and the authorities who wanted to rid the streets of the unruly and unregulated street trade. Initiatives to eradicate street trading had occurred intermittently in the past; various attempts to curtail street- based trading had been known during the reigns of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and Charles I (1625–1649).Knight, C., \\"Street Noises,\\" Chapter 2 in Knight, C. (ed), London, Vol. 1, C. Knight & Co., 1841. p. 135 These constant attacks contributed to a sense of group identity amongst vendors and inculcated an air of open defiance. Street traders composed their own broadsides in which they asserted their own political identity in songs.Peddie, I., \\"Playing at Poverty: The Music Hall and the Staging of the Working Class,\\" in Krishnamurthy, A. (ed), The Working-Class Intellectual in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain, Ashgate Publishing, 2009, pp 235–254 Historians have argued that the cries of the city where far from annoying, rather they were an essential form of transmitting important information prior to the modern period of mass communications.Garrioch, D., \\"Sounds of the City: the soundscape of early modern European towns,\\" Urban History, 2003, Vol. 30, no. 1, pp 5-25, abstract The term, Street Cries, is written with a capital \\"C\\" to distinguish the vendors' melodic sounds from the general noise of the street.Shesgreen, S., Images of the Outcast: The Urban Poor in the Cries of London, New Brunswick, N.J., Rutgers University Press, 2002, p. 2 Street Cries began to disappear from the mid-20th century as permanent markets supplanted the informal and itinerant street trade.Jones, P.

A., \\"Redressing Reform Narratives: Victorian London's Street Markets and the Informal Supply Lines of Urban Modernity,\\" The London Journal, Vol 41, No. 1, 2006 p. 64 and pp. 73–74 In literature, music and art Cover of Cries of London by Robert Laurie and James Whittle, 1802 The Street Cries of major cities such as London and Paris became such an iconic feature of street life that the subject stimulated the interest of poets, writers, musicians and artists. One of the earliest literary works inspired by street cries is Guillaume de la Villeneuve's thirteenth-century poem, Les Crieries de Paris (Street Cries of Paris).Aimeé Boutin, \\"Sound Memory: Paris Street Cries in Balzac's Pere Goriot,\\" French Forum, Volume 30, Number 2, Spring 2005, pp. 67–78, DOI:10.1353/frf.2005.0029 In 1409, an English monk, John Lydgate, composed a ballad, London Lyckpeny which refers many street cries, including the often quoted \\"Strawpery ripe, and cherrys in the ryse\\".Mayhew, H., London Labour and the London Poor, Vol. 1, (originally published in 1848) NY, Cosimo Classics, 2009, p. 4; Hindley, C., A History of the Cries of London: Ancient and Modern, London, Reeves & Turner, 1881, pp. 2–11 The ballad, is a satire that recounts the tale of a country person visiting London to seek legal remedies after having been defrauded. However, he finds that he cannot afford justice, and is soon relieved of his money through his dealings with street sellers, retailers, tavern-keepers and others. A lyckpeny (or lickpenny) is an archaic term for anything that soaks up money.London Sound Survey, Historical References to London's Sounds, http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/index.php/survey/historical_ec/economic1/157/184 Lydgate's ballad prompted generations of composers to write songs about the distinctive cries of street vendors.Maccoll, E. and Seeger, P., Travellers' Songs from England and Scotland, Routledge and Kegan, London, (1977), 2016, p. 147 As early as the 13th century, musicians included street cries into their compositions. A tune known as On Parole/ a Paris/ Frese Nouvelle, dating to the 13th century features a Parisian vendor's cry, 'Frèse nouvele! Muere france!' ('Fresh strawberries! Wild blackberries!'). From around 1600 English composers wrote tunes in which the text and probably the music incorporated street vendors' cries: Weelkes, Gibbons and Deering composed tunes that consisted almost entirely of street vendors' cries. Such tunes became very popular in the 17th century.Apel, W., Harvard Dictionary of Music, Harvard University Press, 1969, pp 808-9 It has been suggested that street cries may have been one of the earliest forms of popular music.edited Shepherd, J., Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume II, A & C BLack, 2003, p. 170 The 19th century folk song, Molly Malone, is an example of a tune based on street cries that has survived into the modern era. The lyrics show the fish vendor, Molly Malone, chanting \\"cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh\\". The tune may have been based on an earlier 17th or 18th century song.Waite, H. R., Carmina Collegensia: A Complete Collection of the Songs of the American Colleges, with Selections from the Student Songs of the English and German Universities, Diston, 1876, p. 73 The tune, \\"El Manisero\\" (translated as the \\"Peanut Vendor\\"), inspired by a Cuban peanut vendor's cries, was a popular hit in the 1930s and 1940s and was largely responsible for popularising Latin music and the rhumba with American audiences.Pérez, L.

Between 1609 and 1611, he is supposed to have taught at the court and therefore received subsidies from the royal treasury. In 1613, the Danish king published a letter stating that all men of the \\"Roman Catholic\\" religion must leave Denmark. Aagesen, who had been suspected of being on the Pope's payroll as early as 1604, was informed of a ruling made in the governing body of Copenhagen University on 15 September 1613 that, since he had Catholic sympathies, he should not be allowed to continue as organist. In 1615, he was replaced by Johan Meincke. After that he is known to have lived in Danzig (now Gdańsk) in 1625.

It started as a producer of jazz, then expanded into many other genres, including comedy, rock, and Star Trek soundtracks. Currently GNP Cresendo is run by Gene Norman's son, Neil Norman.  History  After hitchhiking from New York to Los Angeles, Norman promoted concerts at the Shrine Auditorium, The Hollywood Bowl and the Pasadena Civic Center, hosted popular radio shows on KFWB and KLAC, and opened his own nightclubs, the Crescendo and The Interlude, on the Sunset Strip. The Crescendo hosted a wide swath of jazz legends and comedians, from Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday to Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, Don Rickles, Dick Gregory, Woody Allen and Bob Newhart. Norman often paid acts their weekly rate for a single night's engagement. The inspiration for the label was to issue live recordings made at concerts promoted and organized by Norman, under the umbrella of \\"Gene Norman Presents\\". GNP's releases included Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, Gerry Mulligan, Frank Morgan, Max Roach, Charlie Ventura and Teddy Buckner. GNP expanded beyond jazz. In the 1960s, it recorded Billy Strange, the surf band The Challengers and the rock group The Seeds, which landed four singles in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In the 1980s, GNP gave Robin Trower and Savoy Brown comebacks. In 1982 zydeco musician Queen Ida won the label its first and only Grammy Award out of several nominations. Gene Norman's son Neil, a fan of science fiction, secured a licensing deal from Paramount to release soundtracks of Star Trek, both in its TV and movie incarnations. This led to a new area of concentration for the label. Neil Norman is also a musician who has released many albums on GNP (including numerous albums of themes from science fiction film and television). He also directed feature length films about GNP artists The Seeds and Rusty Warren. Currently, he is president of the label having started in the mail room and eventually producing many albums.

This town is situated atop the Charmadi hills in the Western Ghats section. The Western Ghats is one amongst twenty-five identified hot spots for biodiversity conservation in the world.BBC NEWS  Science/Nature  Map: Biodiversity hotspots Banakal is surrounded by coffee estates and paddy fields and known for its pleasant weather throughout the year. Banakal town is the headquarters of Banakal Hobli. Banakal lies on the banks of the Hemavati River. The Hemavati, which flows through Banakal, originates in Western Ghats. This long river covers about of drainage area and considered as a prime source of irrigation along with natural rainfall. The geographical location of Banakal is 13°0'59\\" North and 75°53'9\\" East.  Culture  The people lead a monotonous way of life irrespective of the religious diversities. Generally life is slow paced as it is seen in most of the agriculture dominant villages of Chickmagalur district. The vokkaliga community is dominant and owns most of the landed property like agricultural fields and coffee estates. Folk songs and folk dances are given much importance. During special occasions men play Kolata - a group dance using sticks, and women do perform folk dances and folk songs like Bhaagyada balegaara hogi baa nanna tawarige are noteworthy.most of muslims were having provision store and coffie business in banakal = Cuisine = The Malnad food style is followed. Rice and wheat are a part of the daily menu. Traditional dishes like Rotti, Ganji-oota, Kadubu-chatni and shevige are eaten. Generally people are non-vegetarian. Some traditional dishes like Edli- chatni, Iruve-chatni [chigaLi chuttney] Edi Sambar(Crab) and Maralu-meen-saru are now vanishing from the daily menu. = Language = Like Are Bhashe spoken by the Gowdas of Sullia in Dakshina Kannada, the people in this region speak another dialect of Kannada which can be called Gowdra Bhashe. This dialect is sweet and has powerful expressions. People belonging to the Tuluva community speak Tulu with Ghatta accent, little different than actual Tulu used in South Canara. Local Muslims speak a dialect of Urdu known as Dakhini. Bearys, the immigrant Muslims hailing from a neighboring district, Dakshina Kannada, and who are engaged in various small scale business activities do speak Beary bashe. = Festivals = Suggi Habba is the main festival celebrated at the time of harvesting. All Hindu festivals are celebrated by Gowdas and local communities. Tulu speaking people also celebrate Hindu festivals. Muslims observe Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha as it is universally observed. Christians celebrate all Christian events and the local church festival is called Saint- Mary. Banakal Jatre is the car-festival that occurs once a year and attracts a lot of people from adjacent villages. Bhuta Kola and Kori Katta are the other events celebrated by mainly Tulu speaking communities, which is a cultural and religious aspect as some Theyyam deities are propitiated through blood sacrifice or cock-sacrifice which does also include the cockfight and is a prime example of \\"cultural synthesis of 'little' and 'great' cultures\\".A Panorama of Indian Culture: Professor A. Sreedhara Menon Felicitation Volume - K. K. Kusuman - Mittal Publications, 1990 - p.127-128 \\"  Economy  Agriculture is the main source of economy. Rice which forms the chief food of people in southern India is the main crop and is being produced in large scale. Coffee plantations are another prime source of economy which makes the region distinctive and contributes to the national economy. The coffee estates in this region became world famous when they began to compete with Brazil in both producing and exporting coffee beans. Both the genetic subspecies of high quality coffee, namely Robusta and Arabica, are being produced, processed and exported. Black pepper and cardamom are the other economic crops. Oranges have also been produced in some areas. Honey and other forest products also contribute to the economy.  Flora and fauna  River Hemavati flowing at the southern side of Banakal Most of the land is brought under cultivation. Paddy or rice fields provide multiple crops in a year based on monsoon. Coffee (both Robusta and Arabica) is the main plantation crop. Other crops include black pepper, cardamom and produce of the forest. Good quality honey is abundantly available in this region. Tall straight Nilgiri plantation is found on the southern bank of river Hemavati alongside coffee plantation. Natural forests surround the village. Wildlife and rich birdlife can also be seen. Teak and sandalwood are abundant. Because of irregular prices lately people have lost interest in food crops. Economic crops have taken the place of food crops, and more land is used for that purpose.  People  Generally lifestyle is slow paced and people do live cordially irrespective of caste and religious differences. Although Gowdas are economically dominant, Bunt and Billava are the immigrant Tuluva communities from adjacent Dakshina Kannada also are seen. The Muslim community can be identified as local Deccani (a dialect of Urdu and Hindi) speaking farmer community and immigrant Byari business community. A good number of Christians belonging to Roman Catholic speaking Konkani and some Protestants also are inhabitants of Banakal. Byari and Kannada are main business language in Banakal.

Hpaung Daw U Pagoda (, IPA: ), also spelt Hpaung Daw Oo or Phaung Daw Oo) is a notable Buddhist site in Myanmar (formerly Burma), located on the Inle Lake in Shan State. Surrounding the Pagoda, and in the basement are shops selling traditional Shan and Burmese merchandise. The pagoda houses five small gilded images of Buddha, which have been covered in gold leaf to the point that their original forms cannot be seen. The gold-leaf application to such excess is relatively recent. Old photographs hanging on the monastery walls show some of the images in a more pristine form. It is reported that some gold has been removed on occasion to reduce its mass. Although the monastery is open to all for veneration, only men are permitted to place gold leaf on the images. Another part of the ritual for pilgrims is to place a small robe or thingan around the images, and to take the robe back to their houses and place it on their own altar as a token of respect for the Buddha and his teachings. Phaung Daw U Festival Phaung Daw U Pagoda Festival karaweik barge. The images are of differing sizes, range from about nine to eighteen inches tall. Being essentially solid gold, the images are extremely heavy. It is believed that the Buddha images were brought to Inlay Lake by King Alaungsithu.  History  Annually, during the Burmese month of Thadingyut (from September to October), an 18-day pagoda festival is held, during which four of the Buddha images are placed on a replica of a royal barge designed as a hintha bird and taken throughout Inlay Lake. One image always remains at the temple. The elaborately decorated barge is towed by several boats of leg-rowers rowing in unison, and other accompanying boats, making an impressive procession on the water. The barge is towed from village to village along the shores of the lake in clockwise fashion, and the four images reside at the main monastery in each village for the night. The high point of the festival is on the day when the images arrive at the main town of Nyaung Shwe, where most pilgrims from the surrounding region come to pay their respects and veneration. In the past, the Saopha of Yawnghwe would personally welcome the images. The images would be taken from the barge and a grand procession would take them to the palace or haw of the Saopha, entering the prayer hall from the eastern entrance, and where it would reside for a few hours. The public was allowed inside the prayer hall of the haw to pay their respects. Then the images would be taken to the main temple in Nyaung Shwe. Since the mid-1960s, the images have bypassed the visit to the haw and taken directly to the temple. It is now usually welcomed to Nyaung Shwe by some high-ranking official in the government. Sometime in the 1960s during a particularly windy day, when the waves were high on the lake, the barge carrying the images capsized, and the images tumbled into the lake. It was said that they could not recover one image, but that when they went back to the monastery, the missing image was miraculously sitting in its place.

The concrete box girder bridge was opened on 14 December 1986 by the Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, and is owned and maintained by Transport for NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The Pacific Motorway is the main road link between Sydney, the Central Coast and the Hunter Region. The only other road that links all three regions is the Old Pacific Highway (B83) which from to follows a scenic winding route.  History  The Old Pacific Highway (now known as B83) served as the only highway route between Sydney and the Central Coast and the Hunter Region. The original 1930 two-lane steel truss bridge carried the Old Pacific Highway across Mooney Mooney Creek. This bridge remains in concurrent use and is located downstream of the existing Mooney Mooney Bridge. With population and traffic growth, the scenic winding highway route was beset by traffic jams, especially at peak holiday times. Whilst planning for a new high-speed freeway-style traffic link between and began in 1952, it was not until April 1963 when construction of the first section of the F3 Pacific Freeway started, between the Hawkesbury River and , completed in December 1965. A second stage from Mount White to was completed in October 1966. South of the Hawkesbury River, the freeway-grade section to was completed in December 1968, as a toll road. In October 1973 the Peats Ferry Bridge was duplicated as the Brooklyn Bridge, connecting the Berowra-Hawkesbury River and Hawkesbury River-Calga sections. Concurrently, the freeway was opened from to and to Wallarah Creek sections in December 1983, including the single carriageway motorway link from Wallarah Creek to the Pacific Highway at . The section between Calga and Somersby, including the new Mooney Mooney Creek bridge was opened on 14 December 1986, as thousands of people walked across the twin bridges. The freeway carried two lanes heading north and two lanes heading south. Additional developments were made as follows: * September 1987freeway was completed from Wallarah Creek interchange to Mandalong Road interchange * March 1988freeway completed from Mandalong Road interchange to Freemans Waterhole interchange * March 1989Wahroonga to Berowra section opened * December 1990section from interchange to Palmer's Road completed * December 1993Palmer's Road to section opened * December 1997“missing link” between Ourimbah and Kangy Angy opened * November 1998final stage of freeway opened between Minmi and John Renshaw Drive, Beresfield * December 2004completion of widening to six lanes of the four-lane sections between the Hawkesbury River and Calga * November 2009completion of widening to six lanes of the four-lane sections between Wahroonga and the Hawkesbury River, resulting in a continuous six lane width over the from Wahroonga to Kariong * August 2013road signs are being changed to show the new M1 marker and the new name Pacific Motorway as part of the statewide alpha numeric route scheme. Design Mooney Mooney Bridge was designed by Bruce Judd of the then NSW Department of Main Roads and built by Enpro Constructions by the free cantilever method of post tensioned concrete. It consists of twin bridges, each bridge with a main span and two approach spans. The span at the western end of the bridge is long, the main span is long and the eastern span is long.. Retrieved on 13 February 2007. The design has been said to demonstrate how good engineering design and good aesthetics are synonymous, and has been used as a standard in the design of bridges throughout New South Wales. They employ a two rail parapet which optimises views of the landscape. The bridges were designed with the natural surroundings in mind and form a simple uncluttered shape so not to detract from the natural bushland of the national park. The three span haunched girders on the bridge were critical to this as were the multiple piers that provide character and strength. Incidents The Mooney Mooney Bridge has been the site of several accidents, resulting in the Pacific Motorway being closed to traffic and causing delays. Some of these accidents have prompted debate on whether a new road should be built to supplement the existing freeway. On 23 October 2004 a semi-trailer's brakes failed coming down the Freeway and caused a pile-up involving 35 vehicles that had slowed down as a result of a car accident on the other side of the bridge. This accident resulted in the death of a woman. On 12 February 2007 another accident occurred when a truck was travelling down the freeway and lost control approaching the bridge, smashing through a guard rail and plunging 30 metres down an embankment at the side of the bridge. The Mooney Mooney Bridge, because of its height, has been susceptible in the past to people committing suicide. As a result, a fence was erected along the side of the bridge to prevent people jumping off. This fence was erected in 2003 and cost 1,000,000.

Artists' increased use of multi-media, digital, and internet media since the 1960s has called into question the conventional strategies by which society preserves, cares for, and redisplays cultural artifacts created with or on ephemera media formats. While the most obvious vulnerability of new media art is rapid technological obsolescence, the study of its other aspects that defy traditional conservation—including hybrid, contextual, or 'live' qualities—has provoked investigation into new strategies for preserving conceptual art, performance, installation art, video art, and even to a limited extent painting and sculpture. Relationship to other preservation efforts The catchall term sometimes applied to such genres, variable media, suggests that it is possible to recapture the experience of these works independently of the specific physical material and equipment used to display them in a given exhibition or performance. As the nature of multi-media artworks calls for the development of new standards, techniques, and metadata within preservation strategies, the idea that certain artworks incorporating an array of media elements could be variable opens up the possibility for experimental standards of preservation and reinterpretation. Nevertheless, many new media preservationists work to integrate new preservation strategies with existing documentation techniques and metadata standards. This effort is made in order to remain compatible with previous frameworks and models on how to archive, store and maintain variable media objects in a standardized repository utilizing a systematized vocabulary, such as the Open Archival Information System model. While some of this research parallels and exploits progress made in the practice of Digital preservation and Web archiving, the preservation of new media art offers special challenges and opportunities. Whereas scientific data and legal records may be easily migrated from one platform to another without losing their essential function, artworks are often sensitive to the look and feel of the media in which they are embedded. On the other hand, artists who are invited to help imagine a long-term plan for their work often respond with creative solutions.  Preservation strategies  =Storage= The acquisition and storage of the physical media-equipment, such as DVD players or computers, used in multi-media or digital artworks has proven a short-term tactic at best, as hardware can quickly become obsolete or can 'stale' in storage. Storage is also notoriously bad at capturing the contextual and live aspects of works such as Internet art, performance art and live electronic music. Variations on storage include: * Refreshing The periodic transfer of an audiovisual or digital file from one cassette or disk to another device of identical format. * Restoration The cleaning or repair of an existing artifact or file, especially when the new version supersedes or replaces the original. * Networked storage The use of computers linked by a persistent data loop to keep critical files in circulation or as multiple copies cloned on multiple hard drives. =Migration= To migrate a work of art is to upgrade its format from an aged medium to a more current one, such as from VHS to DVD, accepting that some changes in quality may occur while still maintaining the integrity of the original. This strategy assumes that preserving the content or information of an artwork, despite its change in media, trumps concerns over fidelity to the original look and feel. =Emulation= The process of simulating an older operating system (or by extension, other supporting infrastructure) on a newer software or hardware platform is called emulation. As in migration, the impetus behind emulation is to keep a work alive though its original media may become obsolete; unlike migration, however, emulation of computer-based art preserves the original code underlying the artwork. Emulation software is currently in various stages of development and efficiency.  Seeing Double: an emulation testbed  In 2004, the Guggenheim Museum, in conjunction with the Daniel Langlois Foundation, held an exhibition entitled Seeing Double: Emulation in Theory and PracticeSeeing Double: Emulation in Theory and Practice as a trial of emulation. In the exhibition, artworks operating on their original physical media were displayed alongside versions emulated on newer physical media. The exhibition was organized with the participation of computer researcher and emulation specialist, Jeff Rothenberg. In 1998, Rothenberg had published \\"Avoiding Technological Quicksand: Finding a Viable Technical Foundation for Digital Preservation\\". (1999 full text ) =Reinterpretation= The most powerful, but also most risky, preservation strategy for new media art is to reinterpret the work each time it is re-created. Reinterpretation may require rewriting code for a completely different platform, following site-specific instructions regarding installation, or recasting a work in a contemporary medium with the metaphoric value of an outdated medium. Reinterpretation is a dangerous technique when not warranted by the artist, but it may be the only way to re-create performed, installed, or networked art designed to vary with context. Preservation tools =Variable Media Questionnaire= First developed in 2000 by Jon Ippolito, associate curator at the Guggenheim Museum, the Variable Media Questionnaire The Variable Media Network is an interactive form linked to a larger database, which is designed to capture behavioral information about digital, performative, and other variable media artworks upon their acquisition by a museum. The goal is to specifically define 'what it is' and 'what is needed' when the museum is acquiring a work of this kind. The goal of the Questionnaire is to assist artists and museum professionals in understanding which attributes of an artwork may change and how best to make those changes when future re-creations necessitate them. Based on the premise that some aspects of an artwork's logic or presentation can be considered independently from the physical context and equipment used to display that artwork, the Questionnaire captures information about the following behaviors or medium-independent aspects: * Contained Covers glazing; coating; support/structure/mounting; frame; acceptable change in surface. * Installed Covers space; boundary; access; lighting; sound; security; base/s; distribution of elements; display equipment for inert elements; architectural placement; equipment visibility. * Performed Covers props; set; costumes; performers; number of performers; format of instructions; instructions apply to...; documentation of new performances; audience location; boundary; synchronization of performance. * Interactive Covers user input; interaction mechanism; maintenance. * Reproduced Covers relationship to artist master; location of master; status of master; acceptable fabricators and vendors; acceptable submasters or exhibition copy; permission to create submaster; fate of exhibition copy; permission to compress/digitize. * Duplicable Covers inert material; physical attributes of inert material; authorized fabricators and vendors; materials duplicated according to...; electronic equipment and hardware; fate of exhibition copies. * Encoded Covers screen resolution; color palette; external data source; fonts; source openness. * Networked Covers exhibition context; external data sources; non-standard protocol; minimum bandwidth; network model. Metadata standards =Media Art Notation System (MANS)= Developed by Richard Rinehart, Digital Media Director and Adjunct Curator, Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive, MANS is described as a 'formal notation system for media art' that is in keeping with existing preservation frameworks and vocabularies currently being used to document and preserve other forms of art by museums. Using the metaphor of the musical score, as a form of declarative and conceptual notation of music, Rinehart likens Media Art to musical compositions that are able to maintain their original integrity while being realized by different instruments or in different arrangements, over evolving time periods; in this sense, scores are considered to be inherently variable. In Rinehart's view, media art (in which logical information is considered separate from physical hardware) is able to be 'scored' based on the information acquired from a document like the Variable Media Questionnaire to be realized by different media-equipment. Maintaining the notion of the musical score, the Media Art Notation System is derived as (and has as its underlying structure) an interpretation of computer programming languages, drawing primarily from Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL), a type of Extensible Markup Language (XML) that allows for greater, more granular descriptions of a multi-component digital object. MANS has three layers; the conceptual model of documentation, the preferred expression format (vocabulary) for the model (the interpretation of DIDL XML) and, its top layer, the score, which serves as a record of the work that is database-processable. It is hoped that by interweaving the ideas of a declarative language and a more procedural language, MANS is able to act as a backbone to the artwork by being specifically suggestive though not overly prescriptive of how to best delineate and then, later, reinterpret an artwork.  History of new media art preservation  =Individual efforts= Numerous contemporary art conservators have contributed individual efforts toward new media art preservation: *Carol Stringari of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York As a deputy director and chief conservator, Stringari led laser research of a monochromatic painting by Ad Reinhardt and project on conservation of the works of László Moholy-Nagy. She later won the CAA/Heritage Preservation Award for Distinction for Scholarship and Conservation for her work on Ad Reinhardt's technique. *Pip Laurenson of the Tate Gallery in London Head of Time-based media conservation at the Tate, Laurenson is currently working to achieve her PhD in the care and management of time-based media works of art at University College London. *Jill Sterret of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Director of Collections & Conservation at SFMOMA, Sterret is an avid collector and preserver of artworks made by contemporary artists. She is committed to the vital collaborations between artists, curators, technical experts, registrars, and conservators that support contemporary art conservation practice. =Consortium efforts= The variable media concept was developed in 1998, first as a creative strategy Ippolito brought to the adversarial collaborations produced with artists Janet Cohen and Keith Frank, and later as a preservation strategy called the Variable Media Initiative that he applied to endangered artworks in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's collection. In 2002 the Guggenheim partnered with the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology in Montreal to form the Variable Media Network, a concerted effort to develop a museum-standard, best practice for the collection and preservation of new media art. Apart from Stringari and Ippolito, other key members of the Variable Media Network included Alain Depocas, Director of the Centre for Research and Documentation, Daniel Langlois Foundation; and Caitlin Jones, former Daniel Langlois Variable Media Preservation Fellow at the Guggenheim Museum. Around this time similar investigations into the preservation of digital/media art were being led on the West Coast by Richard Rinehart, who published an article on the subject, \\"The Straw that Broke the Museum's Back?

In 2002, Timothy Murray founded the Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art. Named after the pioneering critic of the commercialization of mass media, the late Professor Rose Goldsen of Cornell University. The Archive hosts international art work produced on CD-Rom, DVD-Rom, video, digital interfaces, and the internet. Its collection of supporting materials includes unpublished manuscripts and designs, catalogues, monographs, and resource guides to new media art. The curatorial vision emphasizes digital interfaces and artistic experimentation by international, independent artists. Designed as an experimental center of research and creativity, the Goldsen Archive includes materials by individual artists and collaborates on conceptual experimentation and archival strategies with international curatorial and fellowship projects. Other important initiatives include DOCAM, an international research alliance on the documentation and the conservation of the media arts heritage organized by the Daniel Langlois Foundation, and the International Network for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (INCCA), organized by the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage (ICN).

A CPDO is normally embedded in a note rated by a credit rating agency. CPDOs employ dynamic leveraging in a similar (but opposite) way to Credit CPPI trades. CPDOs are formed first by creating a SPV that issues a debt note. The SPV invests in an index of debt securities, commonly credit default swap indices such as CDX and iTraxx (in theory, this could be deal-specific, such as a bespoke portfolio of sovereign debt), similar to a CDO. The structure allows for continual adjustment of leverage such that the asset and liability spreads stay matched. In general this involves increasing leverage as when losses are taken, similar to a doubling strategy, in which one doubles one's bet at each coin toss until a win occurs. The investment index is periodically rolled, whereby the SPV must sell protection on the new index and buy back protection on the old index. In doing so, it incurs rollover risk, in that the leaving index may by than the new index.  Initial reaction  The first CPDO deal was issued in 2006 by ABN-AMRO and was rated AAA/Aaa. Many analysts were initially skeptical of the rating assigned, partly because the CPDO note paid interest of Libor plus 200bp but also since the deal contained a majority of market risk (spread risk) rather than credit risk - an exposure not normally rated by rating agencies. A few months later, Moody's released a comment to the effect that, while they still stood by their original rating, they acknowledge that the rating is highly volatile compared to other triple-A rated instruments. They also indicated that future deals would be highly unlikely to achieve the same rating with the same spread. Fitch Ratings in April 2007 released a report warning the market on the constant proportion debt obligations (CPDO) dangers. Later CPDOs had more conservative structures and were offered at AAA/Aaa with a much lower spread. Financial Times reported on May 21, 2008 that an investigation by FT has discovered that Moody's awarded incorrect triple-A ratings to billions of dollars' worth of a type of complex debt product due to a bug in its computer models. Internal Moody's documents seen by the FT show that some senior staff within the credit agency knew early in 2007 that products rated the previous year had received top-notch triple A ratings and that, after a computer coding error was corrected, their ratings should have been up to four notches lower.  Credit Crunch  The sudden widening of credit spreads that occurred in 2007 and 2008 as a result of the credit crunch caused considerable losses to the net asset value of many CPDOs. The rating agencies that had entered the CPDO rating business have downgraded many of them and some have already defaulted. The failures of these highly rated notes has been used by critics in criticisms of the rating agencies, although not all agencies have rated them and some agencies had provided the market with early pre-crisis warnings.

He was the first chief editor of Tintin magazine and wrote scripts and articles anonymously for many of their publications.Van Melkebeke entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed 16 December 2013. A friend of Hergé, Van Melkebeke took part in a semi-official way in the development of some of the storylines of The Adventures of Tintin, adding a number of cultural references. He is also supposed to have contributed to certain elements of the Blake and Mortimer series, although Edgar P. Jacobs disputed this fact. Van Melkebeke's personality was one of the main sources of inspiration for the Blake and Mortimer character Philip Angus Mortimer.  Career  Born in Brussels, Van Melkebeke was a childhood friend of Edgar Jacobs and Jacques Laudy. He spent his twenties pursuing fine art painting. During the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, Van Melkebeke was responsible for main articles in Le Soir Jeunesse, the children's supplement of the daily newspaper Le Soir. During this period, when he first crossed paths with Hergé,Farr, Michael. The Adventures of Hergé, Creator of Tintin (John Murray, 2007), p. 34. Van Melkebeke's strip Les Nouvelles Aventures du Baron de Crac ran in Le Soir as well. As a fine arts painter himself, Van Melkebeke encouraged Hergé's own interest in art, introducing him to art world figures of the time.Farr, Adventures of Hergé, p. 39. Van Melkebeke painted a portrait of Hergé which hung in the cartoonist's home for many decades. Van Melkebeke co-wrote with Hergé two Tintin plays which were staged from 1941 to 1942: Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond and Mr. Boullock's Disappearance.Ce mysteriéux Monsieur Hergé (\\"That Mysterious Mister Hergé\\"), published by La Dernière Heure in 2003 Although he had primarily written cultural articles, after the war Van Melkebeke's position at Le Soir Jeunesse resulted in a 1945 judgment of collaboration and of incitement of racial hatred. This suspicion of \\"incivism\\" prevented Van Melkebeke from continuing a regular career in journalism; for instance, after Van Melkebeke became the first editor of Tintin magazine in 1946, he was immediately forced to step down. From that point, Van Melkebeke worked under the pseudonym George Jacquet or as a ghostwriter, on such projects as Tintin, Laudy's strip Hassan et Kaddour, and Paul Cuvelier's Corentin. In the mid-1950s Van Melkebeke worked on a new children's comic strip called Les Farces de l'Empereur for Ons Volkske/Chez Nous. In 1954, Van Melkebeke suggested to Hergé the idea of setting Tintin in Tibet (1958–1960) in that country, possibly being influenced by the fact that he had set the play Mr. Boullock's Disappearance there.Lofficier, Jean-Marc and Lofficier, Randy (2002). The Pocket Essential Tintin. Harpenden, Hertfordshire: Pocket Essentials, pp. 73-74. As a prank, Van Melkebeke once wrote a fake letter to Tintin magazine demanding that an insult Captain Haddock used – \\"Pneumothorax\\" – be removed. (A pneumothorax is a medical emergency caused by the collapse of the lung within the chest). The letter was allegedly from a father whose boy was a great fan of Tintin and also a heavy tuberculosis sufferer who had experienced a collapsed lung. According to the letter, the boy was devastated that his favourite comic made fun of his own condition. Hergé wrote an apology and removed the word from the comic.Thompson, Harry (1991). Tintin: Hergé and his creation (First ed.). Hodder & Stoughton. . Van Melkebeke spent his later years returning to the field of fine art painting.  Personal life  Van Melkebeke's daughter Chantal, a teacher, is the wife of the Japanese film critic and academic researcher Shigehiko Hasumi.Mouchart, Benoît (2002). À l'ombre de la ligne claire: Jacques Van Melkebeke, le clandestin de la B.D. Paris: Vertige Graphic. . He identified himself as an atheist. Appearances in Tintin When Hergé started working with collaborators such as Jacobs, he would herald their contribution by having them make cameo appearances in his albums. The ever- smiling Van Melkebeke thus appears in Tintin stories such as: * The Secret of the Unicorn (1943) – page 2, panel 14, where he is examining a book as a man calls out that his suitcase is being stolen * Tintin in the Congo (1946, color version) – page 1, panel 1, as one of the reporters seeing Tintin off on his adventure * King Ottokar's Sceptre (1947) – page 59, panel 6, when Tintin is about to be knighted * The Seven Crystal Balls (1948) – page 57, panel 2, in the background when General Alcazar is boarding the steamer at Saint-Nazaire harbour References Category:Belgian comics writers Category:Belgian journalists Category:Belgian comics artists Category:Belgian illustrators Category:Belgian collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:20th-century Belgian painters Category:Belgian writers in French Category:Belgian art critics Category:Belgian atheists Category:20th-century Belgian dramatists and playwrights Category:Tintin Category:1904 births Category:1983 deaths Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Jacques Van Melkebeke"},{"id":"9461085","text":"Sardar Abdullah Khan Tarzi (died 1970) was a twentieth century Afghan Statesman from Kandahar province in Afghanistan.Encyclopedia of the Developing World: Volume Three...Link As a country \\"elder,\\" he participated in the national Loya Jirga (loya means \\"great\\" or \\"grand\\" and jirga means \\"council\\" or \\"assembly\\"), specifically the one in 1964 that was called by Mohammed Zahir Shah, which acted as a constitutional convention.

His most recent album, I'm in Need, was released in 1996. He had also performed alongside such artists as The Boogie Blues Band and Charlie Wood. Govan had become one of the favorite musicians on Beale Street, known for his cavernous baritone voice. He routinely performed for over two decades at the Rum Boogie Café. Early life Govan was born in McComb, Mississippi, and by the age of 13 was playing the guitar. Career Govan played for a group named The Vans, when he was discovered by Fame Studio's George Jackson. He recorded with Fame's Mickey Buckins in 1969. He recorded several singles with Fame through 1972, but they failed to sell. These recordings, including several that were never released, were released by Ace Records in 2013. Govan performed at Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1989 to 2014, performing vocals and percussion. Starting in 1994, he performed regularly with the Boogies Blues Band at the Rum Boogie Café, Beale Street. In that time, they were named the Best House Band on Beale Street three times by the Beale Street Merchants Association, and they headlined the BSMA awards for the 2002–2004 Awards Ceremonies. Govan and fellow musician Don Chandler both received a key to the City of Memphis for their contribution to the music scene in Beale Street over the previous 15 years. Such an honor has not been received by any other musician on historic Beale Street. Govan was the hero of the Porretta Soul Festival, Tribute To Otis Redding, Italy, where he performed from 1993 to 1997.

Common elements that may be forgotten: relationships, special talents (e.g.: juggling, whistling, instrumental talents, etc.), where they live, abilities in certain areas (e.g.: a new gymnast forgetting she cannot cartwheel yet), and events such as concerts, shows, or traumatic events (e.g.: a death/suicide of a loved one or attempt on one's own life). Hypnosis =Overview= Hypnotic amnesia, or forgetting under hypnosis, appears to be similar to naturally occurring clinical amnesia. However, hypnotic amnesia is distinct from naturally occurring amnesia because forgotten memories can be restored through a hypnotist's prearranged signal. Also, hypnotic amnesia is usually incomplete, meaning that the participants do not forget everything they were instructed to forget. Due to this trait, hypnosis can be used to research selective amnesia through studies that direct attention to the targets, or erased memories, of hypnotic amnesia.Hilgard, E. R., & Hommel, L. S. (1961) Selective amnesia for events within hypnosis in relation to repression. Journal of Personality, 29, 205-216 =Use in memory research= Researchers have used the relationship between hypnosis and selective amnesia to study specific memory processes including memory recall and retrieval cues.Bertrand, L. D., & Spanos, N. P. (1984). The organization of recall during hypnotic suggestions for complete and selective amnesia. Imagination, Cognition and Personality, 4(3), 249-261Davidson, T. M., & Bowers, K. S. (1991). Selective hypnotic amnesia: Is it a successful attempt to forget or an unsuccessful attempt to remember? Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 100(2), 133-143 Bertrand and Spanos (1984) were able to study the process of memory recall by hypnotizing a group of undergraduate students, teaching the students three lists of words, and compelling the students to forget certain parts of these lists. They discovered that clustering related information together during initial learning may play a significant role in memory recall. In another experiment, Davidson and Bower (1991) found that participants with selective amnesia due to hypnosis were able to remember all non-amnesic information with near perfect recall. They also noticed that the participants recalled this information in very structured ways (usually in the same order the information was given). These results suggest that people experiencing hypnosis are still able to attend to important retrieval cues even though they are not able to recall the material specifically targeted by the amnesia. Factors =Emotional connotations= People may be more susceptible to hypnotic amnesia if the words they are asked to forget (or remember) have significant emotional connotations.Clemes, S. R. (1964). Repression and hypnotic amnesia. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 69, 62-69 Clemes (1964) was able to identify participants’ critical words—words that are linked with inner conflict—and neutral words—words that are not linked with inner conflict. He then placed the participants under hypnosis and listed nine critical words and nine neutral words. Participants were then instructed, under the influence of hypnosis, to forget half of the words they were given. They found that participants are more likely to forget critical words than neutral words. However, a replication study conducted by Stam and colleagues (1980) failed to replicate these results, suggesting that these conclusions may be invalid.Stam, H. J., Radtke-Bodorik, H., & Spanos, N. P. (1980). Repression and hypnotic amnesia: A failure to replicate and an alternative formulation. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 89(4), 551-559 =Familiarity= One's familiarity with a task influences how selective amnesia affects the subject's memories.Lewis, D. J., Miller, R. R., & Misanin, J. R. (1969). Selective amnesia in rats produced by electroconvulsive shock. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 69(1), 136-140 To study this phenomenon, Lewis and colleagues (1969) taught rats a simple passive avoidance task, a fear-aggravated test used to evaluate learning and memory in rodent models. Some rats were allowed to familiarize themselves with the task while others were only allowed to experience the task once. After the rats had completed their task a pre-determined number of times, the experimenters administered an electroconvulsive shock to the rats meant to induce selective amnesia. These shocks varied in duration, lasting from zero to five seconds. The results of this study showed that only the rats unfamiliar with the task demonstrated selective amnesia 24 hours later. The rats that were familiar with the task seemed to display normal memory for the task. Thus, there might be a particular stage in the memory process that is vulnerable to selective amnesia. The current hypothesis is that this vulnerable stage is located during the transition from active memory to short term memory. =Types of memory= In an experiment investigating the functional role of the entorhinal cortex pars medialis in memory formation, Hölscher and Schmidt (1994) found that they could produce selective amnesia for specific types of memories by creating lesions in the brains of rats.Hölscher, C., & Schmidt, W. J. (1994). Quinolinic acid lesion of the rat entorhinal cortex pars medialis produces selective amnesia in allocentric working memory (WM), but not in egocentric WM. Behavioural Brain Research, 63(2), 187-194 In this experiment, both lesioned and non-lesioned rats were placed in an eight-armed maze with food in one of the arms. The rats had to orientate themselves to their surroundings to find the food. Rats with lesions showed significant memory problems, including memory failure and increased memory retrieval times, during trials in which they had to orient themselves using distal cues, the most distant cues. The researcher labeled these memory problems as selective amnesia. They also found that lesion-ed rats had a more difficult time finding the food when it was moved to a different arm. When the lesion-ed rats had to orient themselves in an egocentric test using proprioceptive cue, there were no detectable memory defects. This finding suggests that the type of memory a subject is trying to remember may influence the subject's susceptibility to selective amnesia. =Serial position= Watanabe and Yanagisawa (2000) found that the serial position effect may determine the task's susceptibility to selective amnesia.Watanabe, S., Yanagisawa, N. (2000). Serial position effect and selective amnesia induced by scopolamine in mice. Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi = Japanese Journal of Psychopharmacology. 20(1), 17-20 In their study, the researchers put mice through a maze with six ‘gates’. Each of these ‘gates’ had three doors, two of them locked and the third unlocked. They found that the mice were better at remembering the position of the unlocked gate if the gate's position was taught at the beginning or end of the trial. These findings provide support for the primacy effect and recency effect of serial positioning. Watanabe and Yanagisawa then took this a step further and injected some of the mice with high and low doses of scopolamine. At low doses, scopolamine intensified the primacy effect of serial positioning, and at high doses, scopolamine created major defects in general learning abilities. Their findings suggest that scopolamine may contain a property which plays a role in selective amnesia, specifically as it relates to serial positioning. =Memory consolidation= Some research suggests that selective amnesia may be the result of a deficit in memory consolidation.Mathis, C., Lehmann, J., Ungerer, A. (1992). The selective protein-kinase-C inhibitor, NPC-15437, induces specific deficits in memory retention in mice. European Journal of Pharmacology. 220(1), 107-110 Mathis and colleagues (1992) investigated the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on the memories of rats and found that they could induce a dose-dependent deficit in memory retention. They classified this memory deficit as selective amnesia. In this experiment, mice were trained to avoid a certain leg of a Y-shaped maze. After training, the experimenters gave a dose of NPC 15437 to the mice and noticed that the mice exhibited selective amnesia for the temporal aspect of the task but not the spatial aspect. The experimenters eliminated the possibly that this amnesia was due to a deficit in memory acquisition and retrieval, concluding that PKC interferes with the mechanisms behind memory consolidation. Use in treatment It has been suggested that inducing selective amnesia for particular events or stimuli in patients may be an effective tool in psychotherapy.Alexander, L. (1953). The effect of electroshock on a \\"normal\\" person under recent stress: An experiment elucidating the influence of electroshock on the defensive operations of the ego. The American Journal of Psychiatry, 109, 696-698 Alexander (1953) found that administering electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to patients suffering from a traumatic life event induces selective amnesia for the traumatic event without effecting the patient's surrounding memories. This finding, as well as other similar findings, has been used to form a hypothesis concerning the mechanisms underlying ECT. This hypothesis states that the most decisive effect of ECT is the arousal of the active defensive operations in the brain. They further hypothesize that the arousal of these operations makes ECT an effective treatment for depression and other psychotic disorders in which the brain's defensive operations are ineffective. This hypothesis would also explain why ECT is an ineffective treatment for disorders in which the defensive operations are overactive such as anxiety disorders. Thus, selective amnesia, if utilized under the correct circumstances, may be useful in a therapeutic setting. In everyday life All people experience selective amnesia in their lives, and this selective amnesia may allow individuals to use their attention more effectively.Rodrigues, S. (2011). Using chemistry simulations: attention capture, selective amnesia and inattentional blindness. Chemistry Education Research and Practice. 12(1), 40-46 In these studies, selective amnesia is defined as the phenomena experienced when a participant pays attention to the information given but then almost immediately forgets it. Rodrigues (2011) conducted a study in which participants were put into pairs and each pair was given five minutes to interact with an assigned stimuli. The participants’ actions and speech were recorded during this time. After the five minutes were completed, the experimenter questioned the participants about why the participants made certain decisions or said certain things. Rodrigues found that inattention blindness, attention capture, and selective amnesia all played a role in the participant's overall accuracy. Thus, even though most other forms of amnesia are harmful, selective amnesia may play a practical, and even helpful, role in our lives. Case studies Because of the relative rarity of naturally occurring clinical selective amnesia, many case studies have been undertaken to learn more about the cause and course of the disorder. =Patient A= The following section is a summary of a case study performed by Scheerer and Goldstei in 1966.Scheerer, M., Goldstei, G. (1966). Denial and selective amnesia following brain damage – A case study. Neuropsychologia. 4(4), 357-363 Patient A was a 36-year-old mechanic, formerly in the Navy, who had a wife and three children. Due to an unfortunate accident, Patient A's frontal lobe experienced significant damage. This brain damage resulted in a slight decrease in cognitive and physical skills as well as a change in personality. There were also some specific memory problems suggestive of selective amnesia. For example, Patient A worked with the same doctor for many years. However, if the doctor was absent for several days, Patient A was unable to remember him or, if Patient A did remember him, he thought the doctor was a Naval officer. Also, Patient A could only vaguely remember events that happened recently. For instance, he could remember if someone had visited him the day before but could not remember who had visited him. He could also report that he had formerly been in the Navy and that he had a wife and children, but there were many gaps and inconsistencies in his memory. While studying these inconsistencies, Scheerer and Goldstei found that Patient A's memory was sharpest for positive memories and weakest for negative memories. The study of Patient A gives evidence to the theory that patients with selective amnesia cling to specific memories, specifically positive memories. However, this fixation on positive memories causes patients to misremember negative or neutral life events, causing their memory to appear disjointed and defective. =Patient B= The following section is a summary of a case study performed by Sirigu and Grafman in 1996.Sirigu, A., & Grafman, J. (1996). Selective impairments within episodic memories. Cortex: A Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System and Behavior, 32(1), 83-95 Patient B was a male in his fifties. He suffered from a heart attack that caused damage to his brain secondary to cerebral anoxia. Due to his injury, he developed severe selective amnesia for the people and dates associated with both personal and public events. Though he could describe what happened during the event as well as the setting of the event, he could not give any information about the event's date or the people involved. His amnesia was temporally limited, affecting only his memories of the last two to three decades. This finding suggests that specific aspects of knowledge is stored separately, allowing for selective amnesia to affect one aspect of an event and not another.

Rich media includes voice and one-way (or two-way) data and one-way (or two-way) video. Members of this community include Internet application developers and service providers, teleconferencing hardware and software suppliers and service providers, telecommunications service providers and equipment vendors, end users, educational institutions, government agencies and non-profit corporations. On July 28, 2014 IMTC and the Unified Communications Interoperability Forum (UCIF) merged into one consortium. The UCI Forum defined interoperability profiles and certification tests, implementation guidelines, and best practices for interoperability between UC products and existing applications. Focus The IMTC focuses on: *Identifying gaps in standards that enable real-time, rich-media communications and the obstacles to ubiquitous utilization of the required products and services in wide area and enterprise networks. *Developing and submitting technology recommendations to official standards bodies -such as the European Telecommunication Standards Initiative (ETSI), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) - to enhance the interoperability and usability of rich-media products and services. *Initiating and conducting interoperability test sessions between suppliers of rich-media products and services. *Educating and promoting the business and consumer communities on the progress and the benefits of the underlying technologies and applications. Summary Headquartered in San Ramon, California, the IMTC was formed in September 1994 through a merger of The Consortium for Audiographics Teleconferencing Standards, Inc. (CATS) and the Multimedia Communications Community of Interest (MCCOI). CATS, formed in 1993, focused on the T.120 standards suite for multipoint data conferencing. MCCOI, also formed in 1993, focused on the ITU-T H.320 (ISDN) and H.324 (POTS) standards suites for multipoint video communications. In December 1995, the IMTC merged with the Personal Conferencing Work Group, Inc. (PCWG). The PCWG had also focused on multimedia teleconferencing standards as well as the needs of users of products and services in this category. The IMTC initiated formal standards initiatives and testing programs (aka Plug fests) to improve interoperability of the products and services in the ecosystem. From the mid-1990s, as the rich-media communications concept extended beyond traditional switched networks to include Internet Protocol (IP) networks, the IMTC acted as an industry convergence point for Voice, Data, and Video over IP. At that time IMTC's efforts resulted in the promulgation of the ITU-T H.323 (packet-based video) standard, agreement on the initial Voice over IP (VoIP) Implementation Framework, and the first integrated interoperability tests involving the ITU-T T.120, H.320, H.324, H.323 standards and emerging IETF requests for comments (RFCs) such as session initiation protocol (SIP). Today, the IMTC retains its focus on addressing rich-media deployment obstacles and interoperability in wide area and enterprise networks. The initiatives IMTC sponsors now include 3GPP, packet switched streaming techniques, enterprise network address translation and wireless/mobility. Its efforts enable service providers and vendors to create more compatible rich-media products, applications and services, which in turn facilitate the widespread adoption of the offerings by protecting end-users' capital investments and meeting usability expectations. Past contribution In the mid-1990s, IMTC's Standards First! initiatives spurred the creation of the ITU-T T.120, H.320, H.324, and H.323 standards that led to the first cross-protocol switched and packet interoperability test sessions (later branded as SuperOp!). In the mid/late-1990s IMTC released a Voice over IP Implementation Agreement, which specified dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) data transfer and reproduction, and IP-specific needs such as directory services and dynamic IP address resolution mechanisms to support multi-party voice and voice-band calls over IP networks. Test suites and procedures developed by the IMTC in the late 1990s demonstrated the viability of connecting gatekeepers, gateways, proxies, MCUs, endpoints and network components into integrated rich-media sessions and interoperability and interworking between IP networks and switched-circuit networks including H.323, SIP, the iNOW! Profile, and the T.120, H.320, H.324 M, H.248/Megaco, and H.450 protocols. More recently IMTC has begun to highlight the interoperability of multimedia offerings for mobile phone users. These offerings are based on the 3GPP specifications for streaming, and interacting with, multimedia content (such as newscasts) on demand and in real-time over 3G wireless networks. They support offline file exchange (which involves raw codec bitstreams, packetized bitstreams and the 3GPP/MPEG-4 file format) and virtual streaming over the Internet and include streaming servers, multimedia terminals and content-creation tools in the value chain. Structure The IMTC is structured as an open organization, and is controlled by its Voting Members. The IMTC's Board of Directors, which oversees the management of the corporation and establishes its operating policies, is elected annually by the Voting Members. Any Voting Member can submit a candidate in these elections. Voting Members also ratify the IMTC's annual budget and any changes to IMTC's corporate by-laws, ensuring that a majority ratifies any changes to member rights and privileges. The IMTC also follows a defined consensus decision- making process. Specifications and recommendations that require product development work, and issues which commit the IMTC to a specific course of action, are balloted within the membership for majority approval. All members are encouraged to participate, voice opinions and help resolve issues. This reflects IMTC's strong commitment to an inclusive, open structure and a \\"make things happen\\" environment. Membership Membership in the IMTC is open to any and all interested parties, including Internet application developers and service providers, teleconferencing hardware and software suppliers, telecommunications service providers, teleconferencing service providers, end users, educational institutions, government agencies, and non-profit corporations.

The second in the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy, the novel examines Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice from the perspective of Fitzwilliam Darcy, the central male character of that novel. Plot summary In relation to Pride and Prejudice, on which the novel is based, Duty and Desire takes place between Darcy's initial leaving of Hertfordshire and his reappearance in Pride's narrative at Rosings Park. Following on from the events of An Assembly Such as This, the novel opens with Fitzwilliam Darcy preparing for the Christmas season with his extended family. Several events have conspired to trouble him, however; as well as his ongoing self-examination of his romantic feelings towards Elizabeth Bennet (who does not appear in the novel, but remains a significant background presence throughout), his sister Georgiana is swiftly recovering from her ill-treatment at the hands of George Wickham by embracing an interest in religion, something encouraged by her new governess Mrs. Annesley but which bemuses and troubles Darcy. Furthermore, Darcy's well- meaning attempts to dissuade his friend Charles Bingley from what Darcy sees as his ill-fated and unrequited romance with Elizabeth's sister Jane are forcing Darcy to resort to underhanded and deceitful tactics that Darcy considers unworthy of himself. Darcy finally decides that he needs a wife, and resolves to find a woman like Elizabeth Bennet from within his own social sphere, thus banishing any lingering feelings he has for her. To that end, he accepts the invitation of Lord Sayre, an old university friend for a week's stay at Sayre's family estate, Norwycke Castle, hoping to find a suitable wife amongst the party gathered there. Accompanied by his loyal valet Fletcher, he soon discovers that the members of the party he is joining are scheming, unscrupulous and not entirely what they seem, and that Sayre himself is a gambling addict who has almost gambled away his entire family estate. Despite this, he finds himself almost drawn with unusual passion to Sayre's disliked half-sister, Lady Sylvanie, who appears to share many of Elizabeth Bennet's charms and characteristics. During Darcy's stay at Norwycke, however, numerous unusual and increasingly sinister events begin to occur; many of Darcy's possessions are stolen or interfered with within his room, the ritualistically slain body of a baby pig is found at a nearby collection of stones imbued with great supernatural and superstitious importance by the locals, and a local child is kidnapped. Darcy and Fletcher, investigating the unusual circumstances, discover that Sayre (who is almost bankrupt) is desperate to have Lady Sylvanie married to Darcy to inherit the estate of his hated and now-deceased stepmother, and Sylvanie herself - who believes herself able to use charms and spells to direct men to follow her will - is herself eager to gain revenge on Sayre, who ruined her and her mother. Darcy manages to untangle himself from their various schemes and uncovers the culprit behind the recent goings-on - Sayre's stepmother, the former Lady Sayre, who was alive all the time and has been manipulating her daughter in an attempt to destroy her stepson. Revealed, Lady Sayre kills herself, but not before forcing Darcy to face his own darker nature and his deeply hidden desires for revenge on George Wickham. Even more unsettled than when he started, Darcy swears off trying to find a wife within his own sphere, leaving him once more alone with his complicated feelings for Elizabeth. Relationship to Pride and Prejudice Duty and Desire takes place during Mr. Darcy's long absence from the plot of Pride and Prejudice, and is the most thematically independent of the \\"Gentleman\\" trilogy. Most of the plot and action are purely the invention of Pamela Aiden. However, most of the issues Darcy encounters—his struggle to understand and help his sister, his realisation of who his real friends are, his failure to interest himself in other women—are crucial to his future success in reaching out to Elizabeth. References to historical people, places and events In the novel a stone circle located near Norwycke Castle is known as either the \\"King's Men\\" or the \\"Whispering Knights\\", the former name being an attempt by a recent owner of the land to obscure the old legends surrounding the circle. It is at the circle where Darcy finds a grisly package that resembles a sacrificed child. The location is based on a megalithic monument known as the Rollright Stones which has two formations, called \\"The King's Men\\" and \\"The Whispering Knights\\" respectively. The legends described in the novel are similar to the legends surrounding the \\"Whispering Knights\\". There is also a reference to the nearby town of Chipping Norton. At the beginning of the novel, Georgiana Darcy receives a Christmas present from her aunt of a novel about \\"a mother and her three daughters...cast out upon the world by a heartless stepson and his odious wife\\". Darcy's uncle expresses his hope that \\"'Sense' is vindicated and 'Sensibility' reproved.\\" Jane Austen's first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, appeared in 1811, when the events of this novel are set. At Darcy's London house the staff are alarmed by reports of people \\"murdered in their beds\\" in Wapping. This is a reference to the Ratcliff Highway murders.

It was completed towards the end of his life, between 1465 and 1470,Upton, 30Kemperdick, 24 and is held in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture; the girl is set in an airy, three-dimensional, realistic setting,Suckale, 84 and stares out at the viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved, yet intelligent and alert.Van der Elst, 69 It is widely regarded as one of the most exquisite portraits of the Northern Renaissance. Art historian Joel Upton described the sitter as resembling \\"a polished pearl, almost opalescent, lying on a cushion of black velvet.\\"Frère, Jean Claude. Early Flemish painting. Terrail, 2007 The panel builds on the work of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and was highly influential in the decades after its completion. Its appeal lies in part in her intriguing stare, accentuated by the slight misalignment of her eyes, while the eyebrows are faintly skewed.Harbison, 126–127 Description Christus frames his sitter in a rigid and balanced architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is divided by the horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, in contrast to the elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master.Ainsworth, 25–26 It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.Kemperdick, 23 Right wing of the Melun Diptych, Jean Fouquet, 1452. Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp. This earlier portrait reflects the Gothic ideal found in the Christus portrait. Light falls on the pictorial space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck.Stapleford, 19 The light throws a murky but curved shadow on the wall behind the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline. Portrait of a Woman, Rogier van der Weyden, c. 1460. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Similarities can be seen in the sculpted features and expression of the model. The girl has pale skin, almond and slightly oriental eyes and a petulant mouth. She reflects the Gothic ideal of elongated facial features, narrow shoulders, tightly pinned hair and an almost unnaturally long forehead, achieved through tightly pulled- back hair which has been plucked at the top. She is dressed in expensive clothing and jewellery and seems to be uncommonly elegant. She looks out of the canvas in an oblique but self-aware and penetrating manner that some art historians have described as unnerving. Joanna Woods-Marsden remarks that a sitter acknowledging her audience in this way was virtually unprecedented even in Italian portrait painting.Brown, 70Woods-Marsden notes just two earlier examples, both of men: Castagno's Portrait of a Man and Mantegna's Portrait of Cardinal Ludovico Trevisan. In Brown, 70 Her acknowledgment is accentuated by the painting's crop, which focuses the viewer's gaze in a near-invasive manner that seems to question the relationship between artist, model, patron and viewer. The headdress is a variant of the truncated or bee-hive hennin, then fashionable at the Burgundian court. A very similar style, with no tail, is seen on the older of two girls in the donor panels of Presentation of Christ by the Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi, a pupil of Rogier van der Weyden.Ridderbos et al., 314 The black band under the chin is rarely found in other images from the period, and has been interpreted as a style borrowed from the male chaperon hat, which always has a long tailing tail or cornette, sometimes worn wrapped under the chin in this way. The influence of van Eyck can be seen in the delicate rendering of the textures and details of the dress, trimmings and adornments. Her pale skin and strong bone structure is strongly van Eyckian, and recalls the male sitter in his Arnolfini Portrait. But in other ways Christus abandons the developments made by van Eyck and Robert Campin. He reduces the emphasis on volume of those artists, in favour of an elongation of form; the narrow, slight upper body and head are, according to the art historian Robert Suckale, \\"heightened by the V-shaped neckline of the ermine and the cylindrical hat.\\" Further, while the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters benefited from the patronage of the newly emerging middle class, secularising portraiture, and removing it from the preserve of royalty, Christus renders the girl as aristocratic, haughty, sophisticated, and exquisitely dressed. Identity of the sitter Detail showing extensive craquelure In a letter dated 1824 or 1825 Gustav Waagen, later Director of the Berlin Museums, gave his interpretation of Latin inscriptions he had seen on the original frame of the portrait, which was subsequently lost. As well as a Christus signature, he found an identification of the sitter as \\"a niece of the famous Talbots\\" (eine Nichte des berühmten Talbots).Ainsworth, 166, though Campbell, 677 cites this to a book of Waagen's published in 1863. The original Latin text of the inscription as Waagen read it does not appear to have been recorded. His research led to a consensus that the sitter was a member of the leading English family, the Talbots, then headed by the Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1863 George Scharf suggested the panel was intended as the right-hand wing to a diptych with the 1446 Portrait of Edward Grimston (or \\"Grymston\\") in the National Gallery, London, leading to speculation that the girl might be Grimston's first wife, Alice.Upton, 30 This was rejected by Grete Ring in 1913, on the basis that neither the dimensions nor background of the panels match, and that the Berlin panel was most probably completed some 20–30 years after the Grimston portrait. Joel Upton, supporting Waagen's analysis, investigated whether the \\"famous Talbot\\" was John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, killed at the Battle of Castillon in 1453. However, John Talbot had only one niece, Ankaret, who died in infancy in 1421. Lorne Campbell suggests that given the Latin signature, Waagen might have misinterpreted the word \\"nepos\\", which can also mean \\"grandchild\\". Upton concludes that she was more likely a daughter of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury,Upton, 29 either Anne or Margaret. Their parents married between 1444 and 1445, suggesting that the sitter was under 20 at the time of the portrait. She may have travelled to Bruges to attend the famously lavish wedding in 1468 of Margaret of York, sister of Edward IV of England, to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.Ainsworth, 168 Provenance The earliest extant record of the painting is in a 1492 inventory of the Medici family, where it is described as a small panel bust of a French lady, coloured in oil, the work of Pietro Cresci of Bruges.Upton, 44Hand et al., 54 However, it seems from other works in the collection that the scribe was uninformed and noted any piece of northern art in the collection as \\"French\\". It was highly valued, with an unusually high price of 40 florins,Stapleford, 114 and prominently displayed. The record does not address the matter of the girl's identity beyond her nationality, indicating that the painting was regarded as of aesthetic rather than historical interest.Nash, 101 Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi, Presentation, c. 1470. National Gallery of Art, Washington In the 20th century Erwin Panofsky was instrumental in furthering Christus' reputation as a major 15th-century northern painter, described the work as an \\"enchanting, almost French-looking portrait\\", perhaps noting the resemblance to the virgin in Jean Fouquet's Melun Diptych. Sterling picks up on this, noting the many similarities between the two women, including their tightly pulled-back hair, high cheek bones, slanted eyes and sulky expressions. The portrait entered the Prussian royal collection with the purchase in 1821 of the Edward Solly collection, from which the then-recently formed Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, was allowed to take its pick. It was positively identified in 1825 as an original by ChristusAinsworth, 25 when Waagen identified the lettering on the (now lost) frame \\"PETR XPI\\" as shorthand for \\"Petrus Christophori\\", which he associated with the \\"Pietro Christa\\" mentioned by Giorgio Vasari in the 1568 edition of his \\"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\\". In this way, Waagen also identified Christus' so-called Saint Eligius panel, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (and seen as just a portrait of a goldsmith), marking the painter's rediscovery after centuries of obscurity. Before this identification, a number of his paintings had been attributed to Jan van Eyck, but became identified with Christus after Waagen established him as a distinct and separate master. Christus is known to have signed six extant works, sometimes with the text \\"PETR XPI ME FECIT\\" (Petr Xpi made me).See Upton, 22, for extant variants of this signatureAinsworth, 30 Over the next century sketches of Christus' biography were constructed, as art historians – notably Panofsky – slowly disentangled his works from those of van Eyck.Ainsworth, 117Upton, 22 Dating Portrait of Maria Portinari, Hans Memling, c. 1470. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York The painting was dated c. 1446 by Wolfgang Schöne in the 1930s, mainly by matching the style and fashion of her clothing to contemporary trends.Sterling, 18–19 In the early 20th century the dating and authorship of works then attributed to Christus were challenged. Max Friedländer proposed a number of dates and an ordering of works in the 1957 volume of his Early Netherlandish painting, but many of his assumptions were discounted by Otto Pächt just a few years later.Sterling, 18 In 1953, Erwin Panofsky established that Schöne's dating was at least twenty years too early. In his view, the girl's dress resembles Burgundian high fashion of the late 1460s to mid-1470s. He compared the hennin worn by Maria Portinari in a c. 1470 portrait by Hans Memling, and her gown to that worn by a lady in an illumination from around the 1470s Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse of Bruges.Panofsky, 313 Sterling, placing the work as c. 1465, remarks that the hennin in the Berlin panel is of a different type to that of the New York painting. The New York headdress is far more extended, and seems to be of a style prevalent a few years after, and moreover lacks the draped and hanging veil. Sterling further notes that the panel has increased depth of field and more intricate detailing of light than Christus' earlier works. On this basis he believes the work was executed late in the artist's career. References =Notes= =Sources= * Ainsworth, Maryan. Petrus Christus: Renaissance Master of Bruges.

It was published by Strategy First and developed by Primal Software. The game was re-released on GOG.com in July 2020.  Plot  The game takes place in an ancient land. There, both humans and dragons had both lived paying no attention to each other until one dragon after studying the human race believed they could be valuable allies to help rid the land of evil. They fought side by side for many battles until finally Skarrbor was defeated. Peace was brought into the world and the dragons taught the humans the secret of magic, but soon a powerful sect called the Zealots grew within the human race that believed the dragons would seek to gain the throne that Skarrbor once held. And so they began to destroy all the dragon eggs they could find. Eventually the dragons decided to leave and avoid another bloody war while one dragon remained behind to hide a dragon egg in the ruins of a temple. That dragon then made a prophecy to a last faithful priest, before he flew away, that the evil Skarrbor would return in the 6th age to once again wreak havoc upon the lands. The 6th age came but the signs were ignored and before long Skarrbor's evil minions once again roamed the land destroying towns and killing all. Although the prophecy foretold doom, it also foretold of a savior. A strong and powerful beast. The Dragon. Gameplay =Playable dragons= Annoth - Annoth is one of the dragons destined to save the world from evil and is colored red with a mix of other colors in the game. Annoth is a powerful and strong dragon who can breathe fire, and is the dragon able to achieve the missile type attack fastest. Because of its strong power, Annoth does not favor using magic. Barroth - The second of the dragons destined to save the world from evil and is colored blue mixed with red in the game. Barroth is a fast and magic using dragon who can breathe cold air, causing the enemies to freeze. Barroth is the only dragon who is able to use many spells and regenerate mana in a short amount of time. Since Barroth only uses magic, it is a more advanced dragon to use. Morrogh - Morrogh is the final dragon destined to save the world from evil and is colored black mixed with some brown in the game. Morrogh is a fast regenerating and dark magic using dragon who can release toxic air into the ground, which is used to poison and kill enemies. Morrogh is the only dragon who is compatible with all skills (except for speed). Since Morrogh is fast on regenerating its health back and can use some basic spells, Morrogh is slow with ability advancement. =Game features= *Build Towns - I of the Dragon features the ability to build towns. After defeating each major enemy in each sector, there is the option to build a town. Towns are randomly constructed cities with an altar in the middle. *Upgrade Towns - The upgrade town feature in the game is only available once you are in possession of the artifact found in one of the Trixter lairs. It can only be used when a town exists, has enough energy to be upgraded and hasn't reached its maximum level. Further levels of towns increase its defensive potential, creates larger walls, more soldiers, etc. *Spells - Each dragon in the game can use spells, some more efficient than others. These spells range from summoning deadly beasts to raising large mountains and volcanoes. *Orbs - Orbs are magical spheres which glow red, green or blue. Each provides a different character-development effect. For example, green spheres provide more spell slots. Orbs are gathered by destroying lairs (monster spawn bases). Reception I of the Dragon received mixed reviews. GameSpot rated it a 6.0 with a statement: \\"I of the Dragon doesn't make much use of its interesting premise. In this game, being a dragon turns out to be a pretty prosaic job. The game does offer some mildly interesting tactical options, thanks in part to the wide spell selection, but those strengths nearly collapse under the weight of the pitifully bland campaign. I of the Dragon has some short-term appeal, but over time it makes you feel like a glorified exterminator, tediously eliminating an endless stream of generic monsters for no real reason.\\" IGN gave it a 4.5 with also a statement: \\"All of this is really a shame, because I of the Dragon had some neat ideas that could have made for one great game. I mean, who wouldn't want to play as a dragon raining fire down on hordes of hopeless creatures while they cringe in fear of your greatness? Unfortunately the poor implementation just makes for one sloppy experience that's not even worth playing when there are so many great titles out this time of year. Don't waste your time.\\"  See also  * DragonStrike - another dragon-sim * Magic Carpet - game with similar gameplay *Drakan: Order of the Flame  References   External links  * Category:Dragons in video games Category:2004 video games Category:Video games developed in Russia Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Strategy video games Category:Strategy First games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"I of the Dragon"},{"id":"9461236","text":"A Riemann problem, named after Bernhard Riemann, is a specific initial value problem composed of a conservation equation together with piecewise constant initial data which has a single discontinuity in the domain of interest. The Riemann problem is very useful for the understanding of equations like Euler conservation equations because all properties, such as shocks and rarefaction waves, appear as characteristics in the solution. It also gives an exact solution to some complex nonlinear equations, such as the Euler equations. In numerical analysis, Riemann problems appear in a natural way in finite volume methods for the solution of conservation law equations due to the discreteness of the grid. For that it is widely used in computational fluid dynamics and in computational magnetohydrodynamics simulations. In these fields, Riemann problems are calculated using Riemann solvers. The Riemann problem in linearized gas dynamics As a simple example, we investigate the properties of the one-dimensional Riemann problem in gas dynamics (Toro, Eleuterio F. (1999). Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics, Pg 44, Example 2.5) The initial conditions are given by : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho  u \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_L  u_L\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\text{ for } x \\\\leq 0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho  u \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_R  u_R \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\text{ for } x > 0 where x = 0 separates two different states, together with the linearised gas dynamic equations (see gas dynamics for derivation). : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\rho_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} & = 0 \\\\[8pt] \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{a^2}{\\\\rho_0} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial x} & = 0 \\\\end{align} where we can assume without loss of generality a\\\\ge 0. We can now rewrite the above equations in a conservative form: : U_t + A \\\\cdot U_x = 0 : where : U = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho  u \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\quad A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\\\rho_0  \\\\frac{a^2}{\\\\rho_0} & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} and the index denotes the partial derivative with respect to the corresponding variable (i.e. x or t). The eigenvalues of the system are the characteristics of the system \\\\lambda_1 = -a, \\\\lambda_2 = a . They give the propagation speed of the medium, including that of any discontinuity, which is the speed of sound here. The corresponding eigenvectors are : \\\\mathbf{e}^{(1)} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_0  -a \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{e}^{(2)} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_0  a \\\\end{bmatrix}. By decomposing the left state u_L in terms of the eigenvectors, we get for some \\\\alpha_{1},\\\\alpha_{2} : U_L = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_L  u_L \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\alpha_1\\\\mathbf{e}^{(1)} + \\\\alpha_2 \\\\mathbf{e}^{(2)} . Now we can solve for \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_2: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha_1 & = \\\\frac{a \\\\rho_L - \\\\rho_0 u_L}{2a\\\\rho_0} \\\\[8pt] \\\\alpha_2 & = \\\\frac{a \\\\rho_L + \\\\rho_0 u_L}{2a\\\\rho_0} \\\\end{align} Analogously :U_R = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_R  u_R \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\beta_1\\\\mathbf{e}^{(1)}+\\\\beta_2\\\\mathbf{e}^{(2)} for : \\\\begin{align} \\\\beta_1 & = \\\\frac{a \\\\rho_R - \\\\rho_0 u_R}{2a\\\\rho_0} \\\\[8pt] \\\\beta_2 & = \\\\frac{a \\\\rho_R + \\\\rho_0 u_R}{2a\\\\rho_0} \\\\end{align} Using this, in the domain in between the two characteristics t=x/a, we get the final constant solution: : U_* = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_*  u_* \\\\end{bmatrix} =\\\\beta_1\\\\mathbf{e}^{(1)}+\\\\alpha_2\\\\mathbf{e}^{(2)} = \\\\beta_1 \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_0  -a\\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\alpha_2 \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_0  a \\\\end{bmatrix} and the (piecewise constant) solution in the entire domain t>0: : U(t,x) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho(t,x) u(t,x)\\\\end{bmatrix} =\\\\begin{cases} U_L, & 0 Although this is a simple example, it still shows the basic properties. Most notably, the characteristics decompose the solution into three domains. The propagation speed of these two equations is equivalent to the propagation speed of sound. The fastest characteristic defines the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition, which sets the restriction for the maximum time step in a computer simulation. Generally as more conservation equations are used, more characteristics are involved.

Etymology The etymology of the place-name itself is unclear, although it is believed the name may be from Old English wella (or the regional dialect variant wella) \\"stream\\" and soc \\"to soak\\", from Old English socian \\"to make wet/damp\\". This is probably because there are several streams running through the area from the moors. History Historically a part of Lancashire, Wallsuches was first built on substantially by the Ridgway family in the 1770s. Thomas Ridgway Snr. owned a bleach works in Bolton until 1770 when a fire destroyed most of the stock and equipment. Wallsuches was selected as the new site due to the availability of land and streams to provide water power to run the bleach works and cotton mill. The main road through Horwich to Bolton had been improved, which was good for business access and employees. In 1777, the new works were opened as \\"Thomas Ridgway and Sons\\". At the time Horwich was a hamlet of 320 residents, mostly self-employed farmers and cotton weavers. \\"Wallsuches Bleach Works\\" brought employment to Horwich and workers came from Horwich, Blackrod, Adlington and Rivington. Wallsuches was highly successful, and by 1780 the former shippon and hut had been converted into a bleach works powered by six water wheels. The Ridgways lived across the main access road from the works in a house called \\"Whitehouse\\", which they renamed \\"Ridgmont House\\", which still stands. Thomas Ridgmont sponsored French chemists Matthew Vallet and Anthony Bourboulon de Boneuil who pioneered the development of chemical bleaching, using chlorine and Wallsuches became one of the first to use the technology. Beforehand, bleaching was carried out using sunlight. The bleach works operated as one of the main industries in Horwich until 1933. The works were closed and the site became derelict and run-down. The area has since been developed for housing by Redrow, incorporating the Grade II listed buildings.

For several years the group was the most prominent act of its style in the country with one founding member going on to record and perform with several Norwegian black metal bands including Dimmu Borgir. While Lord Kaos only released one album, the group was a considerable influence on the local heavy metal music scene as not only arguably the first but one of the few bands to record and perform Norwegian-style symphonic black metal. History Originally a five piece band formed by guitarist Jamie \\"Astennu\\" Stinson and vocalist Jamie \\"The Lord of Night Summoning\\" Marsh, they soon dropped the original drummer in favour of a drum machine and recorded the initial demo, Path To My Funeral Light in 1995. Later the same year, with the membership now down to four; Astennu, Marsh, bassist Incubus and keyboards by Sir Morrison, Lord Kaos recorded the album Thorns of Impurity with Astennu tracking guitars. The album was recorded for release on Sydney label Warhead Records but also found interest from Norway's Head Not Found. This caused a split in the group when Astennu relocated to Norway to pursue release for Lord Kaos there, only for the remaining band members to resist the move. The release of Thorns of Impurity was delayed due to this course of action and it was not issued (by Warhead) until late 1996. By then, Astennu had virtually completed his first Carpe Tenebrum album Majestic Nothingness with vocal contributions from Nagash of Dimmu Borgir, the guitarist for the band he would then join in 1997. With the departure of Astennu, Lord Kaos came to a standstill. However, by early 1997 the group had reconvened with drummer Nigel Chad, guitarist Frank Munoz of the Sydney brutal death metal band Neuropath, and two members of the Newcastle black metal act Empery of Thorns, guitarist Darael and keyboards- player Shaun all being recruited. Incubus then left shortly afterwards, to be replaced by another ex-Neuropath member, Ali Chamas. This line-up remained together for almost two years. At the end of 1997 the band played on the Sydney leg of an Australian tour by Cradle of Filth and work began on a second album. Several tracks were eventually recorded and one, \\"Black Earth\\", later appeared on the 1999 compilation album Under the Southern Cross, from Sydney label Chatterbox Records. In the meantime, Marsh was also singing with a doom metal band called Elysium, with whom he recorded the album Dreamscapes in 1998; however this recording remained unreleased until 2001 when it surfaced on the short-lived Melbourne label Crestfallen Records. Lord Kaos featured at the annual Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra in 1998 but in mid-1999 Munoz and Chamas both left the band. Incubus rejoined for a short time but after Metal for the Brain that year Lord Kaos went into hiatus again. Earlier in 1999 Marsh had joined another black metal act called Crucible of Agony who had played a support show with Impaled Nazarene and recorded several tracks, one of which, \\"Come Forth to the Lands of the Plague Bearer\\", would also appear on Under the Southern Cross. This band did little else however and after a complete line-up change evolved later into The Amenta. By 2000 Lord Kaos was active as a live band once more. Along with Marsh, Darael and Shaun, the group now consisted of Beau Dyer from Elysium on bass and two members of Canberra band Psychrist, Yuri Ward and Glen Blazejak, on guitar and drums respectively. This version of the band featured at Metal for the Brain before playing some shows in early 2001, however several other performances were cancelled and in December Lord Kaos announced it had disbandedtatareanddesire.com - Lord Kaos. Marsh has always remained open to the possibility of Lord Kaos reforming in the future, however this is probably unlikely. His other band Elysium, which also features Dyer, changed its name to Stone Wings in 2003 and released the self-funded album Bird of Stone Wings in 2004. Ward and Blazejak continued to play together in Psychrist until the drummer left in 2003 and the band folded. Ward is now a member of a band called Kill for Satan who have released one album. Astennu was fired from Dimmu Borgir in 1999 and since returning to Australia has recorded a third Carpe Tenebrum album and played in bands including Infernal Method and Stronger Than Hate but since 2003 has concentrated on sound engineering.

He was educated at Charterhouse School and Clare College, Cambridge. He was elected at the 1950 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham Central, a marginal constituency which the sitting Labour MP Geoffrey de Freitas had abandoned for the promising Lincoln seat. He held the seat at the 1951 general election with a majority of only 139 votes, but lost it at the 1955 election to the Conservative candidate John Cordeaux. He contested Nottingham Central again at the 1959 general election, but Cordeaux held the seat with an increased majority.

He was one of the most important and widely read supporters of liberalism and democracy in inter-war Japan. Biography Nyozekan was born in the Fukagawa district of Tokyo, as the son of Yamada Tokujirō. He was adopted into his paternal grandmother's family, and took their name of Hasegawa. From 1885 to 1897, Nyozekan was a student at Dōjinsha, a school founded by Masanao Nakamura. He later attended the Tokyo Hōgakuin legal school (now part of Chuo University). He graduated in 1898 with a degree in criminal law. He was hired by Kuga Katsunan as a journalist in 1903, for the newspaper Nihon. In 1907, he was scouted by Miyake Setsurei and changed to the Nihon oyobi Nihonjin (\\"Japan and the Japanese\\") magazine. A few years later, he returned to newspaper journalism by changing jobs to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun. His writings reveal his leftist political leanings, and in 1918, he resigned in protest after the newspaper was censured by the government. In 1919, Nyozekan and fellow liberal journalist Oyama Ikuo founded the political magazine Warera (\\"We\\"), in which they sought to promote political reform and social democracy, while combating Japan's ever growing militarism and ultranationalism. In 1932, he published one of his most important works, Nihon fuashizumu hihan (\\"Critique of Japanese Fascism\\"), an analysis of the growing phenomena of \\"Japanese fascism”. Increasing government repression and application of the Peace Preservation Laws in the mid-1930s, resulted in Nyozekan's arrest and a brief period in prison. This prompted Nyozekan to change to more subdued style, arguing that the Japanese people and national culture were inherently liberal, rational and democratic, and comparable to British classical liberalism. Although he was forced to keep a low profile, he did not compromise his opposition to militarism and totalitarianism. Surprisingly to some, although Hasegawa wrote essays protesting that journalism must remain neutral and above politics, he also wrote in favor of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in which he saw the potential for the favorable development of Asia economically and culturally under Asian, rather than European influence. In 1946, Hasegawa became a member of the House of Peers for its last session before the abolition of the Meiji Constitution. In 1947, he was elected to the Japan Art Academy, and in 1948 he was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government. His grave is at the temple of Seirin-ji in Bunkyō, Tokyo.

Low-temperature cooking methods include sous vide cooking, slow cooking using a slow cooker, cooking in a normal oven which has a minimal setting of about , and using a combi steamer providing exact temperature control. The traditional cooking pit also cooks food at low temperature. Cooking food by a low-temperature method does not necessarily imply that the internal temperature of the food is lower than by traditional cooking. In the American South, this style of cooking is sometimes referred to as \\"low and slow\\". History Low-temperature cooking has been used for a long time; evidence of its use can be found in indigenous cultures. Samoans and Tongans slow-cook meat in large pits for celebrations and ceremonies. However, the technique was not scientifically examined until the 18th century, when Benjamin Thompson \\"described how he had left a joint of meat in a drying oven overnight and was amazed when, the next morning, he found that the meat was tender and fully cooked.\\". Professor Nicholas Kurti from the University of Oxford repeated these experiments in 1969, and showed that the temperature of Thompson's trial never exceeded 70 degrees Celsius. Theory Meat is cooked for four reasons: to tenderise it, to provide additional flavours, to kill harmful bacteria, and to kill parasites such as Trichinella spiralis and Diphyllobothrium. All four can be achieved by cooking meat at high temperature for a short time, and also by cooking at low temperature for a long time. Each goal is achieved at a different temperature, and takes a different time to achieve. The lower the temperature used, the longer the cooking time. An example of slow, long cooking is Southern pulled pork BBQ. =Tenderisation= Toughness in meat is derived from several proteins, such as actin, myosin and collagen, that combined form the structure of the muscle tissue. Heating these proteins causes them to denature, or break down into other substances, which in turn changes the structure and texture of meat, usually reducing its toughness and making it more tender. This typically takes place between over an extended period of time. =Flavour= Flavours may be enhanced by the Maillard reaction, which combines sugars and amino acids at temperatures above . Meat roasted traditionally in a hot oven has a brown crust which is generally considered desirable, caused by the Maillard reaction. Meat can be cooked at a high temperature for a short time to brown just the surface, before or after being cooked at low temperature, thus obtaining the benefits of both methods. =Bacteria= Bacteria are typically killed at temperatures of around . Most harmful bacteria live on the surface of pieces of meat which have not been ground or shredded before cooking. As a result, for unprocessed steaks or chops of red meat it is usually safe merely to bring the surface temperature of the meat to this temperature and hold it there for a few minutes. See food safety. Meat which has been ground needs to be cooked at a temperature and time sufficient to kill bacteria. Poultry such as chicken has a porous texture not visible to the eye, and can harbour pathogens in its interior even if the exterior is heated sufficiently. =Gravy= Low-temperature cooking reduces the amount of fat and juices, normally used to make gravy, rendered out of the meat. However, when using a plastic bag, little to no evaporation occurs while the meat is cooking which results in plentiful bag juices. Practice Sous-vide low-temperature cooking is carried out by vacuum-sealing food in a plastic bag placed in a water bath or combi steamer with precisely controlled temperature for a long time. The food may then be browned by heating the surfaces to a much higher temperature of perhaps , using a roasting pan or a blow torch (see recipe for cooking steaks) prior to serving. A dishwasher has been used to cook salmon.

They are heavily used in computational fluid dynamics and computational magnetohydrodynamics.  Definition  Generally speaking, Riemann solvers are specific methods for computing the numerical flux across a discontinuity in the Riemann problem. They form an important part of high-resolution schemes; typically the right and left states for the Riemann problem are calculated using some form of nonlinear reconstruction, such as a flux limiter or a WENO method, and then used as the input for the Riemann solver. Exact solvers Sergei K. Godunov is credited with introducing the first exact Riemann solver for the Euler equations, by extending the previous CIR (Courant-Isaacson-Rees) method to non-linear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws. Modern solvers are able to simulate relativistic effects and magnetic fields. More recent research shows that an exact series solution to the Riemann problem exists, which may converge fast enough in some cases to avoid the iterative methods required in Godunov's scheme. Approximate solvers As iterative solutions are too costly, especially in magnetohydrodynamics, some approximations have to be made. Some popular solvers are: =Roe solver= Philip L. Roe used the linearisation of the Jacobian, which he then solves exactly. =HLLE solver= The HLLE solver (developed by Ami Harten, Peter Lax, Bram van Leer and Einfeldt) is an approximate solution to the Riemann problem, which is only based on the integral form of the conservation laws and the largest and smallest signal velocities at the interface. The stability and robustness of the HLLE solver is closely related to the signal velocities and a single central average state, as proposed by Einfeldt in the original paper. =HLLC solver= The HLLC (Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact) solver was introduced by Toro. It restores the missing Rarefaction wave by some estimates, like linearisations, these can be simple but also more advanced exists like using the Roe average velocity for the middle wave speed. They are quite robust and efficient but somewhat more diffusive. =Rotated-hybrid Riemann solvers= These solvers were introduced by Hiroaki Nishikawa and Kitamura, in order to overcome the carbuncle problems of the Roe solver and the excessive diffusion of the HLLE solver at the same time. They developed robust and accurate Riemann solvers by combining the Roe solver and the HLLE/Rusanov solvers: they show that being applied in two orthogonal directions the two Riemann solvers can be combined into a single Roe-type solver (the Roe solver with modified wave speeds). In particular, the one derived from the Roe and HLLE solvers, called Rotated-RHLL solver, is extremely robust (carbuncle-free for all possible test cases on both structured and unstructured grids) and accurate (as accurate as the Roe solver for the boundary layer calculation). = Other solvers = There are a variety of other solvers available, including more variants of the HLL scheme and solvers based on flux-splitting via characteristic decomposition.

Capodimonte is the most outstanding factory for early Italian porcelain, the Doccia porcelain of Florence being the other main Italian factory. Capodimonte is most famous for its moulded figurines.Battie, 104–105; 103–104 on Doccia The porcelain of Capodimonte, and later Naples, was a \\"superb\\" translucent soft-paste, \\"more beautiful\\" but much harder to fire than the German hard-pastes,Battie, 104–105 or \\"a particularly clear, warm, white, covered with a mildly lustrous glaze\\".Le Corbellier, 20 The Capodimonte mark was a fleur-de-lys in blue, or impressed in relief inside a circle.Battie, 104–105; examples: blue and relief The entire Capodimonte factory was moved to Madrid when its founder King Charles inherited the Spanish throne from his brother in 1759. Strictly speaking, this was the end of \\"Capodimonte porcelain\\", but the reputation of the factory's products was so high that the name is often claimed and used for porcelain made in other factories in or around Naples. The first of these was the new royal factory established by Charles' son Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, which manufactured from 1771 until 1806.Battie, 105; Le Corbellier, 29 This is generally known as Naples porcelain, officially the \\"Naples Royal Porcelain Manufactory\\", (Real fabbrica delle porcellane di Napoli) or Real Fabbrica Ferdinandea. Since the 19th century a number of other factories have used the name, for a wide variety of wares, with a great range of quality.Battie, 190  History  Naples biscuit porcelain group of the Bourbons: King Charles at rear, Ferdinand seated, with his wife and some of their 18 children. Filippo Tagliolini, c. 1784 In 1743, the newly arrived Bourbon King Charles and his wife Queen Maria Amalia of Saxony, founded the factory in the grounds of the Palace of Capodimonte on the outskirts of Naples (now a museum). The queen's grandfather, Augustus II the Strong, Elector of Saxony, had founded the Meissen porcelain factory which led European porcelain, and her dowry is said to have included 17 Meissen table services.Le Corbellier, 20 They recruited the Flemish chemist Livio Ottavio Schepers, whose son also joined, and the painter Giovanni Caselli (1698–1752), later followed by his niece Maria. The Florentine sculptor Giuseppe Gricci (c. 1700–1770), already working for the Neapolitan crown since 1738, joined as chief modeller; by 1755 he had five other modellers working for him, creating the moulds used for the pieces.Le Corbellier, 22, 25–26, 29; Munger and Sullivan, 34 The kingdom's diplomatic network around Europe was ordered to seek out experienced workers and trade secrets, paying generously, and internally a successful organized search was made for sources of the correct minerals, with local authorities sending samples to the capital.Davids and De Munck, 327–329 Charles also founded royal factories for making tapestries and pietre dure.Munger and Sullivan, 34 Naples already had many factories making maiolica and other wares, often as a sideline from bricks, but the recruiters for Capodimonte rather looked down on the maiolica workers, and the main roles were given to imported workers.Davids and De Munck, 319–330 The local market developed strongly over this period, helped by a fashion for drinking chocolate, but Capodimonte faced competition from imported porcelain, both Chinese and German, at the top end of the market, and English and local glazed earthenware (creamware and the Italian version called terraglia) in the middle and lower parts of the market.Davids and De Munck, 330–332 When Charles became King of Spain in 1759 he took the equipment and about 40 key workers, including Gricci, with him, to found the Real Fábrica del Buen Retiro in Madrid.Le Corbellier, 29 Since they took nearly five tons of paste, the main artists, and continued to use the fleur- de-lys mark, distinguishing between the products of the two factories from the years around the move can be very difficult.Battie, 104–105; Le Corbellier, 29 Although the Capodimonte structures and equipment such as kilns and moulds that were not taken to Spain were destroyed, many of the remaining workers were hired by the new Giustiniani factory, which attempted to find a formula for porcelain but failed, instead making fine earthenware similar to Wedgwood.Davids and De Munck, 333 When porcelain production resumed after fifteen years, the new Naples factory was completely rebuilt in a different location, initially at Portici, but inherited some workers from the Capodimonte factory, and used a similar soft-paste body. It was notable for Neoclassical subjects and styles, and figures in unglazed biscuit porcelain.Battie, 104–105; Le Corbellier, 29 By 1806, Napoleon had invaded the Kingdom of Naples and the Bourbons fled to Sicily, protected by the British Navy; production was discontinued at the factory. Naples porcelain had the usual mark of a crown over a blue \\"N\\",Battie, 104–105; Le Corbellier, 29 though this mark has been, and continues to be, used by many imitations of greatly varying quality.Battie, 190 Following a trend in the later years of the Naples porcelain factory,Battie, 105 after it closed, Neapolitan potteries continued to make creamware, fine glazed earthenware, similar to English Wedgwood. During the second half of the 19th century, the first private porcelain factories in Naples were created, eventually including Majello (1867), Mollica, Cacciapuoti, Visconti, and many others. Copies and forgeries of the early Capodimonte pieces were made by many factories, apparently the largest in being at Rudolfstadt, then in Germany and now in the Czech Republic. With little or no control over the use of the brand name, many cheap earthenware pieces carry it.Battie, 190 \\"Capo di Monte\\" was also used in the 19th century, for example by Royal Worcester in England, to refer to styles of figurines, that are in fact little related to the 18th-century Neapolitan products.Battie, 173 Characteristics =Capodimonte, 1743–1759= Shell- shaped snuffbox, by Gricci, Caselli and a goldsmith, 1745–1750Munger and Sullivan, 43-45 The true Capodimonte wares of the short period between 1743 and 1759 included tableware of the usual types, figures, and the Porcelain boudoir of Maria Amalia of Saxony entirely made of porcelain panels in a chinoiserie style, originally made for the Palace of Portici (1757–59), but now moved to the Capodimonte Palace.Le Corbellier, 21 The same team later made the rooms in Spain at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez (1763–65) and the main Palacio real in Madrid (1770s).Battie, 104–105 As with other factories of the period, Meissen porcelain was taken as the main model. There are good records from the 1740s, but after that little documentation survives.Le Corbellier, 21–22 The shell-shaped snuffbox, modelled in low relief with further small shells and seaweed, was a Gricci design introduced in the first year which remained popular. The inside of the lid was painted with a portrait or other subject, and a goldsmith added mounts and a hinge.Le Corbellier, 22 Mouse Catchers, modelled by Giuseppe Gricci, 1755–1759 The popular figures of ordinary people were introduced early, and there are large numbers of models; since Buen Retiro concentrated on these, the difficulties in telling Neapolitan and Madrid pieces apart mostly affect these.See for example lots 203 and 205 in the 2012 Sotheby's sale. Figures tend to have \\"exceptionally small heads, wide hands and feet, and restrained painting of both features and costume. A prevailing sense of worried good humor is conveyed by coal-speck eyes, and short, swiftly-drawn eyebrows\\". They are modelled \\"with an unerring eye for pose and gesture\\".Le Corbellier, 25–26 Often colour is only used to define the edges of garments and objects. The soft paste used did not allow as much sharp definition or as thin elements as German hard-paste, and the modellers had to adapt their style accordingly.Munger and Sullivan, 32, 34, 38, 40 The pottery-seller illustrated, adapting a print after a drawing by Annibale Carracci, is one of a series described in the factory records as figure che rappresentano poveri (\\"figures of poor people\\"), although unlike later so-called \\"Capodimonte\\" figures, their clothing is neat and clean. Otherwise such subjects of vendors were called la voci di Napooli (street- cries of Naples).Le Corbellier, 32; Munger and Sullivan, 37–40; Battie, 190 An exception to the general good humour of the series is a figure of a mutilated war veteran beggar, with only one of his limbs complete, and one eye. Only a single example of this is known, which sold for £30,000 in 2012.Sotheby's, London, Lot 192, 14 March 2012, \\"An extremely rare Capodimonte figure of a mutilated soldier, modelled by G.

His clouds are often distinctively coloured \\"in violet and pale orange-red\\" (see saucer in gallery).Battie, 105 Given the scale of production, and the other modellers and painters recorded, curators and scholars are now less certain in attributing particular works to the individual hands of the main designers and painters, although it is clear they established the styles and supervised production closely. Gricci is only known to have signed two large religious figures, and as was normal for the period, painters did not sign their work.Munger and Sullivan, 34, 42 Capodimonte porcelain, 1743 to 1759 File:Beaker and saucer MET DT7471.jpgBeaker and saucer with carved design, c. 1743 File:The Mater Dolorosa MET DP-13079-006.jpgMater Dolorosa and Saint John the Evangelist (18 inches or 46.4 cm high) from a Crucifixion group, Gricci, c. 1744 File:Giuseppe gricci per manifattura di capodimonte, bacile e versatoio, 1745 ca. 03.jpgEwer with coral and seashells, with the gilded interior of its basin behind, c. 1745 File:Pottery seller MET DP169010 (cropped).jpg\\"Pottery seller\\" figure, c. 1745, based on a print after Annibale CarracciLe Corbellier, 32; Munger and Sullivan, 37–40 File:Harlequin and Columbine MET DP169015 (cropped).jpgHarlequin and Columbine, c. 1745 File:Saucer (part of a service) MET SF1995 268 339.jpgSaucer with fighting Orientals, from a tea and coffee service File:Kopp. Capo di monte.

They made many genre figures, and table ware.Battie, 105 Figures of the old subjects from street life now used more conventional proportions, and were more fully painted. Styles were affected by a general European change of taste towards Neoclassicism, intensified by the local interest as the continuing excavations at Pompeii, Herculaneum and other sites near Naples became well- known. Table services were produced in a variety of revival styles, including Roman, Egyptian and \\"Etruscan\\", the last drawing from the imported ancient Greek vases being recovered from Etruscan tombs, and then thought to be Etruscan art.Battie, 105 From 1782 the director of the factory was Domenico Venuti, whose father Marcello Venuti was in charge of the royal collection of antiquities, then at the Palace of Portici.Najbjerg, 64 From the 1790s there was also a large production of figures in unglazed biscuit porcelain, which resembled marble. Many of these were rather loose copies of famous ancient sculptures, especially those in the rich royal collections, including portrait busts; the factory was allowed to borrow these to copy. A wall-painting of Achilles being taught to play the lyre by the centaur Chiron, removed from a house in Herculaneum by the 1750s, was becoming famous, and was reproduced both on a painted cup and as a biscuit figure group by the factory (the 1st- century Roman painting was in fact a rendering of a sculpture in Rome).Najbjerg, 60–61, 63–65. The Chiron and Achilles cup was part of the Servizio ercolanese (\\"Herculaneum Service\\"), an 88-piece service Ferdinand made to present to his father Charles in Madrid, taking the subjects of the designs from the discoveries at Herculaneum. This was the first of a series of large services made to be diplomatic gifts, and is now widely dispersed.Najbjerg, 64; Sotheby's Lot essay by Angela Carola-Perrotti, \\"The service was made up of 41 plates, two soup tureens, four wine coolers of different sizes, two 'stufe per geli', two 'sciacqua bicchieri', two sauce boats with their respective under-dishes, two butter dishes, two sugar bowls, two mustard dishes, four salts, six coffee cups and a number of pieces of serving cutlery\\".

Other biscuit figures were fanciful furry animals such as dogs and bears, showing off the roughened worked biscuit. As at some other factories in these decades, gilding began to be used lavishly. A high figure of Saint Joseph holding the Infant Christ was previously attributed to the Buen Retiro factory around 1765, until it was realized that it was a porcelain version of a statue by Giuseppe Sanmartino in Taranto Cathedral from 1790–92, thirty years after the Buen Retiro team left Italy. The modelling is now attributed to Gennaro Laudato, a Neapolitan sculptor, and at least one other porcelain group is attributed to him. Though unmarked, it is thought likely that the Naples factory produced them. The body appears to be terraglia, the Italian version of creamware.Hess, 238–243 Naples porcelain, 1771 to 1806 File:Plate MET SF1995 268 344.jpgNeoclassical plate with Thalia, muse of comedy, from the Servizio ercolanese (\\"Herculaneum Service\\"), after a painting excavated there, 1780-82.

Diplomatic and commercial relations between the two empires were established from 1855 onwards. The Russian Empire officially ended in 1917, and was succeeded by Communist rule formalized in 1922 by the Soviet Union. For later periods, see Japan–Soviet Union relations (1917–1991) and the Japan–Russia relations (1992–present). Establishment of relations (1778–1860) From the beginning of the 17th century, the Tokugawa shogunate which ruled Japan imposed a state of isolation, forbidding trade and contact with the outside world, with a narrow exception for the Netherlands. Its merchants were restricted to an island in the port of Nagasaki. Entering Japan itself was strictly prohibited. From the early 19th century, the western colonial powers especially Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Russia, were expanding politically and economically into new markets, and were seeking to impose hegemony over much of Asia. Japan was important due to its strategic location off the China coast, with a large and untapped economic potential. As neighbors, Japan and Russia had early interactions, usually disputes over fishing grounds and territorial claims. Various documents speak of the capture of Japanese fishermen on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Some of these Japanese captives were taken to Saint Petersburg, where they were used in the teaching of Japanese language and culture.Marius B. Jansen, The Making of Modern Japan (2000) pp 258-64. =18th century contacts= Russians meeting Japanese in 1779. In 1778, Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin, a merchant from Yakutsk, arrived in Hokkaidō with a small expedition. He was told to come back the following year. In 1779, he entered the harbour of Akkeshi, he offered gifts, and asked to trade, but was told that foreign trade would be only permitted in Nagasaki. Japanese painting of Adam Laxman, 1792 A second episode took place in 1792. Adam Laxman, a Russian naval officer arrived in Hokkaidō. First in the town of Matsumae and later Hakodate, he attempted to establish a Russian trade agreement with Japan in order to break the exclusive trade rights of the Dutch. The Japanese suggested that Laxman leave, but Laxman had one demand: he would only leave with a trade agreement for Russia. The Japanese finally handed over a document stipulating Russia's right to send one Russian vessel of commerce to the harbor of Nagasaki. Secondly, it also restricted Russian commerce to Nagasaki. Trade elsewhere in Japan was prohibited. A final note in the document clearly stated that the practice of Christianity inside Japan was prohibited. Eventually, the Russians sent their vessel of commerce to Nagasaki, but they were not allowed to enter the harbor. The promise was of no value. Tsar Alexander I of Russia had started a worldwide Russian representation mission under the lead of Adam Johann von Krusenstern (Russian: Крузенштерн). With Japan in mind, Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov was appointed to the mission. He was the founder of Russian–Siberian trade in fur and the ideal man to convince the Japanese.George A. Lensen, \\"Early Russo-Japanese Relations\\" Far Eastern Quarterly 10#1 (1950), pp. 2-37. In 1804, Rezanov got a chance to exercise his diplomatic strength in Japan. On board the ship Nadezhda, he had many gifts for the Shogunate and even brought along Japanese fishermen who had been stranded in Russia. But Rezanov could not do what so many had tried before him. An agreement was never reached. During the negotiations, the Shōgun remained silent for months; next, the Shōgun refused any negotiations and finally gave the Russian gifts back. Now Russia acted more assertively, and soon Russian navigators started to explore and map the coasts of the Kuril Islands. In 1811, the Russian colonel Vasily Golovnin was exploring Kunashir Island on behalf of the Russian Academy of Sciences. During these operations the Russians clashed with the Japanese. Golovnin was seized and taken prisoner by samurai. For the following 18 months, he remained a prisoner in Japan, where officials of the Tokugawa Shōgun questioned him about the Russian language and culture, the state of the European power struggles, and European scientific and technical developments. Golovnin's memoirs (Memoirs of Captivity in Japan During the Years 1811, 1812, and 1813) illustrate some of the methods used by Tokugawa officials. Later on, these unsuccessful attacks would be disavowed by Russia and its interest in Japan would drop for a full generation. This would be the case until the First Opium War in 1839. The Russian Tsar Nicholas I realised the territorial expansion of Great Britain in Asia and the expansion of the United States in the Pacific Ocean and northern America. As a result, he founded a committee in 1842 to investigate Russia's power in areas around the Amur River and in Sakhalin. The committee proposed a mission to the area under the lead of Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin. The plan was not approved because officials expressed concerns it would disrupt the Kyakhta trade, and many did not believe Russia had great commercial assets to be defended in these cold and desolate places. The highly esteemed China was surprisingly (in the eyes of the Japanese) beaten by Great Britain in the Opium Wars. Although Japan was in isolation from the outside world, it was not blind to European capabilities and dangers. In light of these events, Japan began modernization of its military and coastal defenses.G.B. Sansom, The Western World and Japan, a Study in the Interaction of European and Asiatic Cultures (1949), pp 212-14, 232, 243-45.) =Yevfimy Putyatin= Yevfimy Putyatin negotiated the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Japan and Russia (\\"Treaty of Shimoda\\"), 7 February 1855. In 1852, on learning of American plans to send Commodore Matthew Perry in an attempt to open Japan for foreign trade, the Russian government revived Putyatin's proposal, which received support from Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia. The expedition included several notable Sinologists and a number of scientists and engineers, as well as the noted author Ivan Goncharov, and the Pallada under the command of Ivan Unkovsky was selected as the flagship. After many mishaps, Putyatin signed three treaties between 1855 and 1858 by which Russia established diplomatic and commercial relations with Japan. (see Treaty of Shimoda) Deteriorating relations and war (1860–1914) Three changes took place during the second half of the 19th century, which caused a gradual shift to hostility in the relations between the two countries. While Russia had expanded to the shores of the Pacific since 1639, their position in the region had remained weak, with perhaps 100,000 settlers and a very long supply line. This changed from 1860 onwards, as Russia by the Treaty of Peking acquired from China a long strip of Pacific coastline south of the mouth of the Amur River and began to build the naval base of Vladivostok. As Vladivostok was not a year-round ice-free port, Russia still wanted a more southern port. In 1861, Russia attempted to seize the island of Tsushima from Japan and to establish an anchorage, but failed largely due to political pressure from Great Britain and other western powers. Japan very rapidly became an emerging industrial and military power, borrowing and adapting the best technology and organizational ideas of Western Europe. Meanwhile, China became increasingly internally weak and was too weak militarily and economically to defend its vast holdings. =Treaty of Saint Petersburg= Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875). In 1875, the Treaty of Saint Petersburg gave Russia territorial control over all of Sakhalin and gave Japan control over all the Kuril Islands. Japan hoped to prevent Russian expansionism in Japanese territories by clearly delineating the border between the two empires. =Tensions escalated in 1890s = Sergei Witte, The Russian finance minister (1892 to 1903) controlled East Asian policy. His goal was peaceful expansion of trade with Japan and China. Japan, with its greatly expanded and modernized military easily defeated the antiquated Chinese forces in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95). Russia now faced the choice of collaborating with Japan (with which relations had been fairly good for some years) or acting as protector of China against Japan. Witte chose the second policy and in 1894 Russia joined Germany and France in forcing Japan to soften the peace terms it imposed on China. Japan Was forced to cede the Liaodong Peninsula and Port Arthur (both territories were located in south-eastern Manchuria, a Chinese province) back to China. China later leased it to Russia. This new Russian role angered Tokyo, which decided Russia was the main enemy in its quest to control Manchuria, Korea and China. Witte underestimated Japan's growing economic and military power while exaggerating Russia's military prowess. Russia concluded an alliance with China (in 1896 by the Li–Lobanov Treaty), which led in 1898 to an occupation and administration (by Russian personnel and police) of the entire Liaodong Peninsula and to a fortification of the ice-free Port Arthur. Russia also established a bank and built the Chinese Eastern Railway, which was to cross northern Manchuria from west to east, linking Siberia with Vladivostok. In 1899 the Boxer Rebellion broke out with Chinese attacks on all foreigners. A large coalition of 11 Western powers and Japan sent armed forces to relieve their diplomatic missions in Peking. Russia used this as an opportunity to bring a substantial army into Manchuria. As a consequence, Manchuria became a fully incorporated outpost of the Russian Empire in 1900, and Japan made ready to fight Russia.B. V. Ananich, and S. A. Lebedev, \\"Sergei Witte and the Russo-Japanese War.\\" International Journal of Korean History 7.1 (2005): 109-131. Online =Japanese containment of Russia= In 1902 Japan and the British Empire forged the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which would last until 1923. The purpose of this alliance was to contain the Russian Empire in East Asia. In response to this alliance, Russia formed a similar alliance with France and began to renege on agreements to reduce troop strength in Manchuria. From Russian perspective, it seemed inconceivable that Japan, a non-European power which was considered to be undeveloped (i.e. not-industrial), and almost bereft of natural resources, would challenge the Russian Empire. This view would change when Japan started and won the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05).Gordon Daniels et al. \\"Studies in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance (1902-1923)\\" (London School of Economics, 2002) online ] =War with Russia 1904-1905= In 1895, Japan felt robbed of the spoils of her decisive victory over China by the Western Powers (including Russia), which revised the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901 saw Japan and Russia as allies who fought together against the Chinese, with Russians playing the leading role on the battlefield.Petr E. Podalko, \\"‘Weak ally’ or ‘strong enemy?’: Japan in the eyes of Russian diplomats and military agents, 1900-1907.\\" Japan Forum 28#3 (2016). In the 1890s Japan was angered at Russian encroachment on its plans to create a sphere of influence in Korea and Manchuria. Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government decided on war to stop the perceived Russian threat to its plans for expansion into Asia.Ian Hill Nish, The Origins of the Russo–Japanese War (1985). After negotiations broke down in 1904, the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur, China, in a surprise attack. Russia suffered multiple defeats by Japan. Tsar Nicholas II kept on with the expectation that Russia would win decisive naval battles, and when that proved illusory he fought to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a \\"humiliating peace\\". The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised world observers. The consequences transformed the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. It was the first major military victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a European one.Geoffrey Jukes, The Russo-Japanese War 1904-1905 (2002) excerpt In 1905 U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt mediated peace. In the Treaty of Portsmouth both sides agreed to evacuate Manchuria and return its sovereignty to China. However Japan leased the Liaodong Peninsula (containing Port Arthur and Talien) and the Russian-built South Manchurian Railway in southern Manchuria with access to strategic resources. Japan also received the southern half of the Island of Sakhalin from Russia. Japan dropped its demand for an indemnity. Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for his successful efforts. Historian George E. Mowry concludes that Roosevelt handled the arbitration well, doing an \\"excellent job of balancing Russian and Japanese power in the Orient, where the supremacy of either constituted a threat to growing America.\\"George E. Mowry, \\"The First Roosevelt,\\" The American Mercury, (November 1946) quote at p. 580 online Eugene P. Trani, The Treaty of Portsmouth: An Adventure in American Diplomacy (1969). The alliance with Britain had served Japan greatly by discouraging France, Russia's European ally, from intervening in the war with Russia as this would mean war with Great Britain. (If France had intervened, it would have been the second hostile Power, and, as such, would have triggered Article 3 of the Treaty.) Relations were good 1905–1917, as the two countries divided up Manchuria and Outer Mongolia.David J. Dallin, The Rise of Russia in Asia (1949) pp 87-122./ref> World War I (1914–1917) The alliance with Britain prompted Japan to enter World War I on the British (and thus Russian) side. Since Japan and Russia had become allies by convenience, Japan sold back to Russia a number of former Russian ships, which Japan had captured during the Russo- Japanese War.

He is known for his early works in the proletarian literature movement, although he later became a strong ultranationalist. His real name was Gotō Toshio (後藤寿夫), although he also used the alias \\"Shirai Akira\\". Early life Hayashi Fusao was born in Ōita Prefecture in 1903. His father was an alcoholic, and bankrupted the family grocery business, which forced his mother to work in a cotton mill to provide income for the family. He was only able to complete high school by working as a live-in tutor in the household of a wealthy banker. Hayashi was able to obtain admission to the law school of Tokyo Imperial University, where he led Marxist seminars, but he left school in 1925 to devote his energies to leftist politics and to the arts. Literary career Hayashi was arrested in early 1926 as part of a roundup of Communists and suspected Communist sympathizers in universities under the provisions of the Peace Preservation Law and was incarcerated for ten months. His literary career began when he was released, with the publication of a short story, Ringo (\\"Apple\\") in Bungei Sensen (\\"Literary Battlefront\\"). This also marked his beginnings as a leading member of the Proletarian literature Movement. With other like-minded writers, he founded the Proletarian Artist Federation in 1927. However, Hayashi was arrested again for his fund-raising activities for the Japanese Communist Party, and was incarcerated in Toyotami Prison, outside of Tokyo in 1930. While in prison, Hayashi was subject to self- criticism and underwent an ideological reversal before his release in 1932. After his release, he moved to Kamakura and wrote Seinen (\\"Youth\\"). This was quickly followed by Bungaku no Tame ni (\\"For Literature\\"), Sakka to shite (\\"As an Artist\\"), whose themes deny the subordination of literature to politics. Hayashi joined Kobayashi Hideo, Kawabata Yasunari, Hirotsu Kazuo and others to publish the mainstream literary journal Bungakukai (\\"Literary World\\") in 1933. From 1934-1935, he moved to Itō, Shizuoka, where he wrote Roman Shugisha no Techo (\\"Notes of a Romanticist\\") in 1935, declaring his estrangement from Marxism. Hayashi returned to Kamakura, where he lived for the remainder of his life, and officially renounced all connections to the proletarian literature movement in 1936. With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, he was also sent to China together with a number of other leading writers (including Eiji Yoshikawa, Nobuko Yoshiya, Kunio Kishida, and Tatsuzō Ishikawa) to be embedded within the Imperial Japanese Army, to write reports and stories supporting the war effort. In 1943, Hayashi toured Korea, Manchukuo and Japanese-occupied north China as a member of the Literary Home- Front Campaign (Bungei Jugo Undo), a speech-making troupe organized to promote patriotism and support for the war. After World War II, together with Ango Sakaguchi, Hayashi coined the term Buraiha in 1947 to describe the new trend in post-war Japanese literature. Along with hundreds of other writers, he was purged by the American occupation authorities and was not allowed to publish until the end of occupation in 1952. His wife, Shigeko, who had been suffering from mental instability for several years, committed suicide at their home in Kamakura in 1952. Hayashi then turned to apolitical popular novels with family themes, including Musuko no Seishun (My \\"Son's Youth\\") and Tsuma no Seishun (\\"My Wife's Youth\\"). In 1962, Hayashi published Dai Toa Senso Kotei Ron, (\\"The Great East Asia War was a Just War\\") in Chūōkōron. The work astounded his former Marxist colleagues with an apologia for Japanese militarism and the Pan-Asianism in World War II, and a stinging criticism of leftist pacifism. Controversy over the work continues, even decades since its publication. Mishima Yukio regarded Hayashi Fusao as his mentor, although the two had a falling out after a meeting in 1966, and Mishima was later highly critical of Hayashi in a critique published in 1971. Hayashi continued to write until his death in 1975. His grave is at the temple of Hokoku-ji in Kamakura. =Dai Toa Senso Kotei Ron= Hayashi wrote Dai Toa Senso Kotei Ron in commemoration of the hundredth anniversary of the Meiji Restoration. It was immediately highly controversial on its release in the Chūōkōron literary magazine, and it has served as a model for later revisionist historians. Hayashi's premise can be summarized as follows: # The Asia-Pacific War cannot be separated from the process of Japanese modernization beginning with the late Edo period. # Japanese modernization was a defensive reaction against western aggression in the colonization of Asia. # The Japanese annexation of Korea and invasion of China and Southeast Asia were necessary to contain western imperialism and became a catalyst for Asian national liberation. # Japan was not an imperialist state in a Leninist sense. # In the process of modernization, Japan did not adopt aggressive imperialism in the western European sense. # The Japanese emperor system is not a fascist institution; it is based on an ethnic and cultural foundation. To Hayashi the real enemy of the Asian nations is the United States, just as the United States has been Japan's foe for the last one hundred years. Although Hayashi remains apologetic about the suffering caused by the Japanese invasion of Asia, he promotes the viewpoint that the war liberated not only Japan, but also the rest of Asia from Western domination.

His film work straddles a period in Italian cinema, 1936–1943, when the industry was largely devoted to the production of mildly propagandistic works, such as Il Re d'Inghilterra non paga (The King of England Will Not Pay) (1941).C.E.J. Griffiths, 'Italian Cinema in the Thirties: Camicia nera and other films by Giovacchino Forzano', The Italianist issue no. 15 (1995), pp 299–321. This type of old-fashioned classical drama, often infused with thinly-veiled Axis sympathies, was to indirectly pave the way for the Italian Neorealism movement, which rejected the melodrama style and consigned it to the industry's past.Lino Miccichè, Il neorealismo cinematografico italiano, Marsilio, Venezia, 1975, pp 136-138  Early life  Umberto Sclanizza was born in Friuli, Italy on 26 February 1893, of Slavic (Slovenian) and noble origins. His parents separated when he was a child, and his father Vittorio took him and his sister Iole to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Vittorio set up in business among the enormous Italian community there. Here Umberto was drawn to the theatre and began training as an actor. In 1915 Italy joined the Allied side in the First World War, and passage was arranged to take young migrant Italians back to their native country to fight. Umberto Sclanizza served in the Army as a front line cook during the war. He decided to remain in Italy after the war, and began working in touring theatre. Through the theatre company he met and married Maria Papa, an actor from the opposite end of Italy (Rosarno, Calabria) who came from a family involved in the theatre for many generations.Sarzi Foundation, http://www.fondazionefamigliasarzi.it/wordpress/mauro-sarzi-2/ accessed 6 July 2019 Three children Scilla Sclaviza (aka Scilla Sclanizza) (1926–2006), Mario Sclaniza (aka Mario Sclanizza) (1927–1993), Iole Sclanizza (1928-2015) were born of the marriage, and a fourth died - along with the mother - during childbirth, around 1930. After the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in 1935-6 theatre companies including that of Umberto Sclanizza were invited to tour in the new Italian East Africa colonies, with significant government subsidies, under the pretext of bringing civilised European culture to Africa.  Film career  As the Second World War approached, Umberto Sclanizza attempted to evacuate his family; his mother had gone to live in Egypt after her divorce, where she had remarried and given birth to a daughter, Ida Ruffato, in 1900. But as the British Embassy was about to issue Visas for Egypt, Italy entered the war on the side of the Axis. Ironically, it was this period that offered the break into films for which he is remembered.Italian Cinema Archive, http://www.archiviodelcinemaitaliano.it/index.php/titoli.html?vtrova=Umberto%20Sclanizza accessed 6 July 2019 His films included: Un' Avventura di Salvator Rosa (An Adventure of Salvator Rosa) (1940); Sei bambine ed il Perseo (Perseus and the six children) (1940); Il Re d'Inghilterra non paga (The King of England Will Not Pay) (1941); Don Buonaparte (1941); Don Cesare di Bazan (1942) aka La Lama del giustiziere, (The Executioner's Blade Italy: reissue title). Umberto Sclanizza worked with leading Italian actors (such as Gino Cervi) and pioneering directors and producers such as Alessandro Blasetti (considered a precursor of Italian neorealism), Flavio Calzavara and Giovacchino Forzano, whose Tirrenia Film Studio (founded in 1934) formed the north-Italian competition for Cinecittà for many years, before finally crumbling. The war came home to Italy in 1943 and the country was divided in bitter civil war. The film movement that emerged from the turmoil, characterised by Italian Neorealism, had little need of classical practitioners like Umberto Sclanizza and Giovacchino Forzano, whose careers never recovered from the association with Fascism. Demoralised and stricken by ill-health, he returned occasionally to theatre work before his death in Venice on 14 December 1951.  Notes  Sclanizza's three children each bore their family surname spelt in different ways, the surname 'Sclanizza' being an italianisation of a Slavic (Slovenian) surname, probably Sclanich. The Fascist era required those with \\"foreign\\" names to make them sound more Italian. 'Sclanizza' is unheard of as a surname outside of the actor's descendant family. Umberto Sclanizza's children often appeared in minor roles in his films and those of his contemporaries.IMDB https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031913/?ref_=nm_knf_t1 accessed 6 July 2019IMDB https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1130587/?ref_=tt_cl_t9 accessed 6 July 2019 Selected filmography * Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence) (1936) dir.

The film was Stamp's first starring role in over a decade and Roth won an Evening Standard award as an apprentice hit man. The title music is provided by Eric Clapton and Roger Waters. Spanish flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia performed the soundtrack music. The film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in April 2009. Plot London gangster Willie Parker (Terence Stamp) gives evidence against his criminal compatriots in return for a very generous offer from the police. Ten years later, Parker is living in comfortable retirement in Spain. Four Spanish youths kidnap him and deliver him to British hit man Braddock (John Hurt) and his sidekick Myron (Tim Roth), hired by the kingpin that Parker helped put away. In the course of the kidnapping the youths run down a Spanish policeman who has been assigned to guard Parker. Three of the youths are then killed by a bomb in a briefcase, which they believe to contain their pay-off, handed to them by Braddock. Braddock is a world-weary professional killer while Myron is his perky but volatile young apprentice. Parker quickly adopts a carefree demeanour, later explaining that he's had ten years to accept death as a simple part of life. Braddock, who has the key to an apartment in Madrid where the owner is away, orders Myron to drive there but when the three walk in they find the place occupied by an acquaintance of the owner. He is a middle-aged Australian (Bill Hunter) with a young Spanish girlfriend Maggie (Laura del Sol) who comes home as they are talking. Parker mischievously announces his identity to them, causing Braddock to take the girl with them as insurance. Harry gives them the keys to the owner's white Mercedes which is brought to the underground garage where the group leave their previous car. As they are about to start Parker makes a comment that causes Braddock to doubt that Harry will keep quiet and he goes back up to the flat and kills him. The group head toward the French border intending to reach Paris, where the kingpin against whom Parker testified is apparently awaiting their arrival. All the while, Parker sows seeds of discord between the two hit men. The Spanish police, led by senior inspector (Fernando Rey), follow quite closely the trail of bodies. Stopping at a roadside bar to buy beers, Myron is laughed at by four youths, so he attacks them and then runs for the car. Myron has developed sympathy for Maggie and feels protective of her. Braddock himself has a confrontation with her when they are alone in which she bites his hand, drawing blood, from which he appears to derive some form of masochistic or self-penitential gratification. Braddock drives up a track leading to a wood by a river where they can rest up. Leaving Myron with Parker he takes Maggie with him to get petrol for the car. Maggie tries to alert the station attendant to her plight, resulting in Braddock shooting the young man dead. Braddock chases after the girl but is unable or unwilling to shoot her. They return to find Myron has fallen asleep and allowed Parker to slip away. Braddock finds him gazing at a waterfall and confronts him about his lack of concern over his impending death. Parker reminds Braddock that death is inevitable for all and quotes John Donne's poem \\"Death Be Not Proud\\". The next day, with ten miles to the border, Braddock stops the car at an isolated hillside and announces that he's scrapped the plans to go to Paris. He relieves Myron of his gun and flings it into the scrub. Suddenly afraid, Parker insists that he can't die until he gets to Paris. Braddock shoots him in the back as he flees. He then turns the pistol on Myron and kills him. Maggie surprises him and they wrestle violently. During the struggle, Braddock fires the last shot into the air and knocks Maggie unconscious. He leaves her alive and drives to a secluded spot where he changes into hiking clothes and walks off through the forest. The police find Maggie and the two bodies. As Braddock attempts to cross the border on foot, Maggie identifies him to the police, who shoot him dead as he tries to escape. The police attempt to question the dying Braddock but he only winks at Maggie before he dies.

Sculpted by Pietro da Salò in the 16th century, the statue takes the form of a crouching, naked hunchback supporting a small flight of steps.  History  According to the writings of Stefano Magno, it was unveiled on 16 November 1541 and was used as a podium for official proclamations. The statutes of Venice or the names of offenders would be proclaimed by an official standing on the block at the same time as they were read out at the Pietra del Bando near Piazza San Marco. It was also used as the finishing point for a punishment for minor misdemeanours; the guilty party would be stripped naked and made to run the gauntlet of citizens lining the streets from Piazza San Marco to the Rialto, saving themselves further humiliation by kissing the statue. By the 19th century, time had taken its toll on the statue. In 1836, it was restored with funds provided by the civic authorities. The block above the hunchback's head now bears a Latin inscription with the year of the restoration:  In culture  It is said to communicate with the Pasquino, one of the talking statues of Rome. From the early 16th century, the Pasquino, a statue of a torso, was used as an agent for critical commentaries against the pope and the authorities. Satirical notes would be attached anonymously to the base of the statue purporting to come from the Pasquino himself. Other statues in Rome would be used to fulfill a similar purpose and establish a dialogue. In the 17th century, the Pasquino exchanged correspondence with concerning the Republic of Venice, Pope Paul V and the writings of Cardinals Baronio and Bellarmino.

Career Walling began his career as an English teacher at Holland Park School in London. In the mid-1970s, while still a teacher, he won a British TV talent contest, New Faces, with a comedy double act called \\"Mr Carline & Mr Walling.\\" He immediately quit teaching and embarked on launching his new career in comedy. When the comedy duo split up, Walling moved into situation comedy, appearing in several series—\\"Just Liz\\", \\"Bootle Saddles\\" and then the very successful \\"Brush Strokes\\". He was also starting to get more work as a screenwriter when he teamed up with Tony Millan. The two of them wrote screenplays for a number of different shows, as well as their own series. In the early 1980s Walling teamed up with session bass player Mo Foster for various comedy music projects, with Walling writing the lyrics and Foster writing the music and producing the resulting songs. One of their songs, \\"The Papadum Song\\", a novelty song revolving around two men visiting an Indian restaurant (one of them for the first time) was repeatedly played on BBC Radio 1 and featured them live on several TV shows (including the BBC's Blue Peter) and was very popular at the time, but fate and industrial action decreed that it would not sell. A three-week strike at the distributors (Phonogram Records) meant that the records never actually got to the shops. The song was eventually re-released in 2006Make Tea, Not War, Angel Air as part of a collection of comedy/parody songs called Make Tea, Not War by the imaginary, but ill-fated and tragic, R.J. Wagsmith Band. Another song from the same album, \\"Chalk Dust\\", which was written for Roger Kitter who released it under the pseudonym \\"The Brat\\", did hit the top ten all over Europe. Walling has appeared in shows such as \\"The Smoking Room\\", \\"Coronation Street\\" and My Family. Walling died on 2 July 2020, six days before his 70th birthday.

TERAS is the creator, developer, and leading system integrator of Touch n Go and SmartTAG in multiple platform technology widely used throughout Malaysia as highway, parking and public transportation payments, and access control system by over 6 million users (in June 2009). With 1,800 toll lanes committed to date, TERAS is the leading provider of Electronic Toll Collection system in South East Asia and control over 70% market share in Malaysia. TERAS now diversified its technology capabilities into transportation and property market. History =1994–1997: Founding= TERAS was formed on 15 September 1994 by Renong Berhad to address the urgent needs of providing cost-effective, reliable and locally supported Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) as the outcome of Malaysia's large-scale program of public enterprises privatization outlined in Privatization Masterplan (PMP) in 1991. The program had enabled the imposition of tolls on roads previously built by the Public Works Ministry or the Malaysian Highway Authority (Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia, or LLM). Following the incorporation of TERAS, Abd Karim Hercus who was instrumental in setting up Electronic Data Processing Department of Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan (PLUS) was appointed as the first managing director. This in turn enabled PLUS TAG, predecessor of SmartTAG and South East Asia first ETC to be immediately developed through technical collaboration with Mitsubishi Electric Corporation of Japan and PLUS. In 1996, TERAS created its own internally developed ETC named TERAS Revenue and Collections System (TRACS) which was instantly deployed for Penang Bridge, North–South Expressway Central Link (ELITE) and North–South Expressway (NSE/PLUS Expressways) nationwide highway network of over 800 lanes. By 18 March 1997, TRACS was enhanced with development and introduction of Touch n Go (pre-paid smart card electronic payment system) at Jalan Pahang Toll Plaza. The year also marked TERAS first international venture as ETC supplier and integrator for Manila–Cavite Expressway, Philippines. =1998–1999: Expansion= The period sees TERAS expanded its core businesses and technology diversification in two major areas; ETC and general Information and Communications Technology (ICT) projects. In term of corporate ownership, the highlight was divestment by Renong Berhad of its 70% equity stake in TERAS to UEM Group for RM11.3 million cash (US$5 million equivalent at that time) in June 1999. A typical entrance of SmartTAG lanes developed and installed by TERAS on Malaysian expressways. In ETC area, TERAS upgraded TRACS through the development of SmartTAG (a non-stop electronic toll collection) and completed its national implementation by 15 March 1999 (replacing PLUS TAG) at 20 toll plazas of North–South Expressway (NSE/PLUS Expressways). Built on a non-stop ETC philosophy, SmartTAG incorporated infra- red communication, a proprietary technology control by an Austrian company; EFKON Gmnbh that communicated with infra-red transceivers mounted at the ceilings of toll plazas to allow vehicle drivers to drive through SmartTAG dedicated lanes and pay toll without stopping. It is designed to process up to 1,200 vehicles per hour. A joint venture between EFKON, under Dr Helmut Rieder was set up with UEM Group that created Infrared Advance Technology Sdn Bhd (IRAT) to produce SmartTAG related hardware and on-board unit for mass production. In general ICT projects, TERAS has bid and won contracts to supply total network environments and IT requirements for the Commonwealth Village in Bukit Jalil, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Games hosted by Malaysia in 1998. At the same year, TERAS was also contracted to design, build and equip TIMEdotCom data center in Glenmarie, Shah Alam. As deterrence for Year 2000 problem (Y2K), TERAS was engaged by nine companies under UEM Group to ensure readiness, through creation of internal operations plans continuity in the event of possible technical glitches caused by the Y2K bug. For financial year 1999, TERAS revenues breached US$20 million mark with over 140 employees employed. The year also marked the appointment of Akbar Ahmad as the new managing director of TERAS. =2000–2004: Stagnation= Early 2000 global recession gave significant impact to TERAS businesses and translated to negative business growth that lasted until mid-2004. The negative business growth was attributed by the deferment of further ETC upgrading works at existing highways and of new highway projects in Malaysia and regionally. TERAS was further affected with cost-cutting measure implemented by most organisation where ICT projects were put as low priority. As counter-measure strategy, TERAS deployed TRACS to other market usages, first as parking automation solution capitalising on Touch n Go platform in 2001. Following that, TERAS Automated Parking System (TAPS) was created and breakthrough was achieved with the first installation of 12 parking sites for Lien Hoe Group. It has grown to over 30 sites within the next 2 years. In 2002, TRACS technology platform was also deployed to door access system for TIME Engineering, UEM Group, UEM Land, Macroworks, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) and various other companies; totalling over 100 operational access doors. These measures enabled TERAS to remain profitable throughout this time-line even with negative business growth. =2005–2008: Rebound= Configuration of typical electronic toll collection system at toll plazas as provided by TERAS in Malaysian Highways. The Malaysia's economy pick-up during the period has benefited TERAS with an average of 20% annual business growth. The Minister of Works, Samy Vellu directive of compulsory minimum 2 Touch 'n Go lanes and 1 SmartTAG lane at all existing and new toll plazas to facilitate highway users ease of travel has positioned TERAS at a higher value. The north bound entrance of SMART Tunnel on the Kuala Lumpur–Seremban Expressway Previously deferred highway construction projects also began in earnest. New Pantai Expressway (NPE), Maju Expressway (MEX), Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel (SMART), Duta–Ulu Klang Expressway (DUKE) and Butterworth Outer Ring Road (BORR) resumed and placed their ETC installation orders with TERAS whilst NSE called for third-lanes widening projects, toll plazas relocation and lanes upgrade, further contributed positively to TERAS. With the realisation of the need to ensure sustainable growth, TERAS consolidated its business activities into three major segments; Transportation, Property and eBusiness. Mercu UEM utilising TERAS' technology adapted from toll i.e.: SmartTAG parking and Touch n Go access security and attendance TERAS first foray into property segment technology development was the implementation of resident/visitor integrated manual; Touch n' Go and SmartTAG access with security surveillance at Ledang Heights housing development, Nusajaya in 2005. The property business segment secured a major US$2.2 million project of Integrated Building Management System with integration of Audio-visual, parking, security access, visitor management and facilities command center of 29-storey commercial office building at KL Sentral Business District, Kuala Lumpur in 2008. Expanding out from ETC in transportation market, TERAS began development in Traffic Control and Surveillance System (TCSS) and scored major contract worth US$2.7 million with NSE for the setup of NSE Nationwide Traffic Monitoring Center (TMC) at Persada PLUS in 2008. International market penetration was marked by TERAS completed the delivery and installation of ETC works for Bhiwandi–Kalyan–Shil Phata Road in India worth US$1.4 million in 2008. Similar planned project in Sri Lanka was however shelved. By end 2008, TERAS effectively controlled 71% of ETC market share in Malaysia with over 1,200 cash highway lanes, 418 Touch n Go lanes, 198 SmartTAG lanes, 90 parking lanes, over 300 access control doors and 1,500 surveillance cameras installed For the period of 1994–2008, TERAS has delivered a total contract worth US$160 million in 4 countries. For financial year 2008 (audited in March 2009), TERAS recorded US$17 million revenue realised from US$36 million book order achieved. Present 200px 200px TERAS has worked with Kemuning–Shah Alam Highway (LKSA), Kuala Lumpur–Kuala Selangor Expressway (KLS) and South Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE) who contracted ETC projects to TERAS worth US$2.5 million, US$3.2 million and US$1.3 million respectively. LKSA is scheduled for traffic operation by 18 May 2010, KLS by third quarter 2010 and SKVE by first quarter 2011. TERAS was also engaged and instructed by Malaysian Highway Authority (MHA) to conduct technology study for the implementation of Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) at North–South Expressway with 1,000 test users at Batu Tiga Plaza and 100 test users at Damansara–Puchong Expressway Penchala Toll Plaza . The study was scheduled and completed on December 2009; aimed at ascertaining feasibility of such technology for use in Malaysia in terms of users' acceptance, issues that might arises and cost benefits. Upon successful system study, MHA plan to implement MLFF as Malaysia next generation ETC with gradual nationwide implementation starting from June 2011 and completed by 2016. Internationally, TERAS is now in the final stage of negotiation for implementation of ETC in Indonesia for Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road and Cimmangis–Cibitung Toll Road. The projects are scheduled for completion by 2011 and 2012 respectively. Both said projects will conservatively add over US$10 million to TERAS balance sheet. Evaluation TERAS was commented for using proprietary technology control by EFKON as a single sourced party in its development of SmartTAG in 1998. The SmartTAG on board unit which is priced at RM100 per unit with compulsory purchase of Touch n Go reload amount of RM100, is heavily subsidised by the highway concessions to pay royalty to EFKON for each SmartTAG assembled by IRAT. Further, it was speculated that SmartTAG infra-red technology will not be able to handle the requirement for Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF). It is expected that the microwave 5.8 GHz transponder systems which are undergoing testing under instruction by Malaysian Highway Authority (MHA) to TERAS will be the replacement of SmartTAG. Final decision on the matter will be decided by the Malaysian Cabinet scheduled by mid-2010. TERAS also being taken to task for its revenue dependencies on UEM Group of companies which contributed to 60% of its total revenues (50% from PLUS alone as the biggest highway concessions in Malaysia). Thus, the restructuring of the company on-going to further broaden its revenue stream. To date, 18 of 25 Malaysia's highways concessions deployed 100% of its technology requirements from TERAS of which the balance 7 use at the minimum of 30%.

He was a commander of the French forces in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) during the First Indochina War, and notably during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. His post-war private and legal conflict with superior General Henri Navarre became a public controversy. Known to his men as Le General Vitesse (General Hurry-Up), and reputable for his military pomp, physical presence and skill with the press, Cogny was killed in 1968 Ajaccio- Nice Caravelle crash in the Mediterranean near Nice. Biography =Early life= Cogny was born in Normandy in April 1904, the son of a police sergeant. An academically gifted boy, Cogny was awarded a scholarship to École Polytechnique, where he received an engineering degree, a diploma from the French Institute of Political Science,Roy, p. 313.Fall, p. 62. and a doctorate in law.Windrow, p. 207. Cogny enlisted in the French Army before the outbreak of World War II, graduating in 1929 from the Fontainebleau artillery school, and was a battery commander by the time the war started. He was awarded the Croix de guerre during early engagements.Roy, p. 313. =World War II= In June 1940, he was one of 780,000 soldiers captured by the German army as it circumvented the Maginot Line. He was held in captivity for almost a year before he escaped in May by crawling naked through a drain pipe with three companions, pushing their disguises out in front of them. He moved back to Vichy France through Bavaria in 1941 to join the Armistice Army and the underground French Resistance.Fall (1961), p. 62. In 1943, now a major, he was arrested by the Gestapo and underwent six months of interrogation and torture in Fresnes prison before being sent to Buchenwald and, later, Mauthausen, concentration camps. He was liberated in April 1945 in a poor state of health. Though he did recover from being a \\"walking skeleton\\", his severe limp would require the use of a cane for the rest of his life. Between 1946 and 1947 he commanded an infantry division near Paris, then gained political experience in an appointment to the War Ministry as executive secretary to the Defence Minister and later to the staff of General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. He was sent with de Lattre to French Indochina in 1950 and after the latter's departure commanded a division in Tonkin and a Groupe Mobile in the Red River Delta. Henri Navarre later offered him command of the Forces Terrestres du Nord Viêtnam (North Vietnam Ground Forces, or FTNV), and he oversaw the French efforts in the Delta until the end of the war.Roy, p. 313. =Dien Bien Phu= According to Davidson, Cogny was in fact the officer who proposed Dien Bien Phu as a \\"mooring point\\"Davidson, p. 182. to Navarre. Jules Roy, however, disagrees. Where Cogny had envisioned a light mobile base of operations, Roy argues, Navarre saw a heavily defended fortress. Cogny was one of many officers who protested against this new strategy, stating that \\"we are running the risk of a new Na San under worse conditions\\" (Na San was successfully defended during a nine-day siege but was thereafter evacuated).Roy, p. 21. These protests, however, had no effect. Though stationed in Hanoi during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu itself, having seen the battle turning against France, Cogny attempted to reach the besieged garrison to take command; however, his aircraft was beaten back by anti-air fire on 17 March 1954. He considered parachuting in, but was advised against it.Davidson, p. 240–1. Throughout the battle, Cogny and his superior Navarre were at odds on the disposition of forces between Dien Bien Phu, Cogny's own sector in the Tonkin Delta, and Navarre's Operation 'Atlante'. In response to a damning letter from Navarre on 29 March, Cogny informed his superior that he no longer wished to serve under his command.Windrow, p. 472. The time scale for his departure was not discussed at the time, and Cogny continued to serve under Navarre, with the relationship between the two degrading significantly. Cogny would continue attempts to with-hold certain reinforcements from Dien Bien Phu or relating relief efforts if he believed it would undermine his strength in the Tonkin Delta.Windrow, p. 543. On 2 May, Navarre went as far to threaten Cogny with an investigation into his 'defeatist' press releases.Fall, (1966) p. 358Windrow, p. 584 As Dien Bien Phu was about to fall, it was Cogny who took the final radio calls from the commander of the garrison there,Roy, p. 313. Colonel Christian de Castries. > De Castries: \\"The Viets are everywhere. The situation is very grave. The > combat is confused and goes on all about. I feel the end is approaching, but > we will fight to the finish.\\" > > Cogny: \\"Well understood. You will fight to the end. It is out of the > question to run up the white flag after your heroic resistance.\\" And: > De Castries: \\"I'm blowing up the installations. The ammunition dumps are > already exploding. Au revoir.\\" > > Cogny: \\"Well, then, au revoir, mon vieux.\\" (literally 'my old one', more > commonly translated as 'my friend', 'my fellow' or the phrase 'old man' in a > sense of friendship)Roy, p. 313. By nightfall, all French central positions had been captured and Dien Bien Phu had fallen. =African command and death= After Indochina, Cogny went on to become a lieutenant general. In January 1957, an assassination attempt on General Raoul Salan in Algeria was revealed to have been executed by a former French paratrooper intending to have Salan replaced by Cogny,Horne, p. 182. who nevertheless went on to become commander of French forces in Central Africa by 1963.Roy, p. 313. On 11 September 1968, while flying across the Mediterranean, Cogny's Air France Sud Aviation Caravelle crashed near Nice. Cogny was killed in the crash along with 94 others. Command style Cogny is seen by historians to have had a particular style of military pomp during his time in Vietnam. Bernard B. Fall remarked that it took \\"a special kind of guts and dash\\" to fulfill Cogny's role during the conflict. As well as \\"Le General Vitesse\\", Cogny was known to his men as 'Coco the Siren' due to his use of motorcycle outriders with sirens. He was a popular commander with his men, and particularly with journalists with whom he often dealt in place of his more reclusive superiors. Cogny focused his interest on the Tonkin Delta region where his troops were stationed, calling himself \\"Delta Man\\". On 7 June 1954 Cogny was the subject of an article in Time Magazine with the title \\"Delta General.\\" Despite his popularity, Cogny was said to be \\"sensitive to criticism\\" and had a tendency to \\"brood on real or imagined injuries.\\" He is criticsed by Roy as having focused overly on blaming Navarre for defeat in Indochina rather than working on a solution.Roy, p. 313.

Moore, was a Liberian poet, novelist, folklorist and essayist. He held various cultural, educational and tourism posts both for the Liberian government and for UNESCO. He was the founder of Liberia's National Cultural Center. He is best known for his novella Murder in the Cassava Patch (1968), the tale of a crime passionnel in a traditional Liberian setting. It became such a classic in Liberian literature that it is still taught in high schools. Life Moore was born in Dimeh, a traditional Gola village on the Monrovia-Tubmanburg highway. He studied at local schools. For college, he traveled to the United States to study agriculture, graduating from Virginia Union University, a historically black college in segregated Richmond, Virginia. He returned to Liberia in 1941 to take up a post in the national civil service. He was also deeply interested in Liberian culture and society. Together with Roland T. Dempster and T. H. Carey, he co-edited the Liberian poetry collection, Echoes from the Valley: Being Odes and Other Poems (1947). He was nominated to work for UNESCO on its Liberia desk. In 1957, he headed the government's Fundamental Education project, designed to bring education and information to rural parts of the country.Tarty Teh, \\"Truth and Magic\\"d misinformation in Liberia President William Tubman appointed him as Under- Secretary of State for Cultural Affairs. In 1962, Moore was one of a team of Vai scholars who took part in a conference at the University of Liberia to standardise the Vai script for modern usage.Michael Everson, Charles Riley and José Rivera, \\"Proposal to add the Vai Script to the BMP of the UCS\\" See (BMP and UCS) Moore had continued his writing. In 1968 he published his first novella, Murder in the Cassava Patch, based on actual events. It was highly popular, securing Moore's reputation as Liberia's best-known writer. His book's success helped Moore maintain his public position through some of the most turbulent years of Liberia's history. Under the government of President Samuel Doe, Moore was appointed Minister for Cultural Affairs and Tourism. He held this position at the time of his sudden death at the age of seventy-one. After a state funeral at the Centennial Memorial Pavilion, attended by cultural troupes from the Dey, Gola, Vai, Kpelle, Gbandi, and Gio tribes, Bai T. Moore was laid to rest in his native Dimeh. Wilton Sankawulo wrote: \\"The best tribute we can pay to the memory of Bai Tee is making our culture part of our daily life, for culturally we are dressed in borrowed robes. Unless we replace these alien garments with ones of our own making, we will continue failing in all our attempts to build a society that can meet our needs and aspirations\\".Wilton Sankawulo, Liberia Sea Breeze (Journal of Contemporary Liberian Writings) Works Moore's earliest published poems appeared as part of the anthology Echoes from the Valley (1947). His first poetry collection was Ebony Dust (1962, reprinted 2001). He next published his novella, Murder in the Cassava Patch (1968), which has been called \\"a Liberian literary classic\\". This short novel - which deals with the murder of a young Liberian girl by her jealous lover - has been part of Liberian school curricula since its publication. It explores traditional Liberian life, referring to human sacrifice and indigenous slavery, as well as contemporary mid-20th century attractions. The Money Doubler (1976) is a novel about a trickster who convinces people to part with their cash on the promise that he will be able to use \\"African science\\" to double it.

The visors are flipped down to protect their faces from hurled projectiles. A riot protection helmet is a type of helmet designed for law enforcement and military use to protect its wearer's head, face and eyes from handheld melee weapons, and thrown projectiles such as bricks, as may be met in riot control. Many modern riot squad helmets are reinforced with materials that will protect the wearer from dangerous substances such as acids or industrial chemicals. The riot protection helmets are usually made to be able to easily fit a Gas mask, especially when tear gas is being used. There have been rare cases of riot protection helmets being worn to protect against objects blown by tornadoes or fierce storms for example in England in the 18 January 2007 gale. Description The simplest form is a hard shell with reinforced padding, and a chinstrap and a hinge-up (usually polycarbonate) visor, as in this image. These riot protection helmet visors are usually curved sideways and straight up-and-down, not curved both ways like on the older type of motorcycle helmet. One accessory is a back-of- the-neck protector. An example of a more complicated riot squad helmet is a French CRS helmet which has two visors: the outer visor is clear and hinges up outside the helmet; the inner visor hinges up between two layers of the helmet and has a finish which can be seen through from inside but from outside looks like opaque polished brass. Accessories can include built-in radio microphone and earpieces. British cash-in-transit officers can also be seen wearing these helmets along with a stab proof vest to prevent serious injury if under attack.

Brian Blair in the World Wrestling Federation from 1985 to 1988 and later on in the independent circuit. The team name is a play on the name of the Miami Dolphins' defensive unit known as the Killer Bs, which was dominant and popular in the NFL at that time, as both team members' last name started with a \\"B\\", as did the last names of several Dolphin players. Before the Bees Jim Brunzell made his debut in 1972, achieving most of his fame along with Greg Gagne as “The High Flyers\\" in the Minneapolis-based American Wrestling Association, where the two won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on two occasions. B. Brian Blair was trained by Hiro Matsuda and made his debut in 1977 in the area of Florida, specifically in Florida-based promotion Championship Wrestling From Florida, competing in various territories (including the WWF) before 1985. Both Blair and Brunzell were considered stand-up wrestlers with lot of potential during their Florida/AWA days, respectively. World Wrestling Federation The two men were signed by the WWF as it continued its national expansion through 1985, debuting under the \\"Killer Bees\\" name. The name was inspired by the 1972 Dolphins' linebackers, whose names all began with the letter 'b,' and were the first to use the moniker. Blair was already a part of the company wrestling as a singles competitor in 1984, mostly as \\"enhancement talent\\" but previously being a mid- card wrestler with lot of potential during 1980 and 1983. The teaming of Blair and Brunzell was suggested by Hulk Hogan. Because Blair and Brunzell were similar in build, the team had a special gimmick referred to as Masked Confusion where both wrestlers would put on identical masks during the match to confuse the opponents and referee and usually win that way—despite this normally being a tactic used by the heels. The “Masked Confusion\\" idea was given to Blair by Billy Red Lyons, who had used it in Maple Leaf Wrestling (albeit as a singles wrestler). One of the most amusing highlights of the team's career came in 1987 at a house show at California University of Pennsylvania. With Blair unable to appear for the team's match against Demolition, he was replaced by S.D. Jones, an African-American journeyman who wore the Bees' black and yellow tights for the day. During the match, the two used the \\"Masked Confusion\\" tactic and the referee, as usual, pretended to be unable to tell the two apart, despite Brunzell being very light-skinned. The inverse would occur later, as S.D. Jones would later replace Brunzell and team up with Blair in a \\"Prime Time Wrestling\\" TV Taping, against Demolition as well. The team debuted on June 17, 1985, defeating the team of Steve Lombardi and Dave Barbie. Coincidentally, this was also Brunzell's first match in the WWF. After facing several makeshift teams, the Killer Bees started a long- running feud with The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). The Bees also had a running feud with the Funks (Hoss, Terry and Jimmy Jack). In August 1986, they faced Hoss and Jimmy Jack Funk in front of 70,000 people at The Big Event in Toronto, a card headlined by Hulk Hogan vs. Paul Orndorff. The team also received a couple of unsuccessful shots at then-WWF tag team champions The Dream Team. The Killer Bees were a part of a battle royal involving wrestlers and NFL players at WrestleMania 2 and next got the spotlight at WrestleMania III, where they faced The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff, losing by disqualification because of the interference of Jim Duggan. After WrestleMania III, the Killer Bees moved on to a feud with WWF newcomers Demolition. By this point, the Bees' stock was clearly slipping in terms of their card placement, though they were one of two teams (with The Young Stallions) to \\"survive\\" the 10-team elimination match at the inaugural Survivor Series on Thanksgiving Day 1987. The Bees' last Wrestlemania appearance would be at Wrestlemania IV, where they once again competed in a battle royal. The Killer Bees’ last prominent appearance was at \\"WrestleFest\\" in summer 1988, where they lost to The Fabulous Rougeaus. In the summer 1988 the Bees split up off-screen without any break up or announcement, and Brunzell and Blair returned being used as \\"preliminary wrestlers\\" thus (at least temporarily) ending the yellow and black days of the Bees. The duo's last WWF match as a team came on August 24, 1988, against The Young Stallions. Brunzell remained with the WWF into the 1990s, achieving many victories in the house show-circuit but failing to do so at TV. Blair would remain with the WWF up until early November 1988, usually scoring victories over preliminary wrestlers at both, TV-Tapings and untelevised events, but failing to beat more established wrestlers. Blair and Brunzell would later complain (and sue) about the WWF still merchandising product of them, without their permission or financial compensation. Although they wrestled as faces throughout their WWF run, it didn't stop rival heels from impersonating the Bees. During a televised WWF at The Philadelphia Spectrum, two wrestlers dressed in Killer Bee masks and T-shirts appeared as lumberjacks during a lumberjack match between Hulk Hogan and \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase, frequently attacking Hogan until Hogan got the upper hand and unmasked one of the Bees ... only to reveal another mask beneath and the unidentified wrestler to escape. Strangely enough, after splitting up, Blair would continue using his \\"Killer Bee\\" outfit and gimmick, and Brunzell would use Killer Bee-like outfits, though, both wouldn't be announced anymore as \\"a half of the Killer Bees tag-team\\" as they used to when teaming up, indicating they were indeed separated. After the WWF In the early 1990s, the Bees reformed in Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation, winning that promotion's tag team titles before the federation folded. While there, they were unable to use the WWF-trademarked name \\"Killer Bees\\" and were instead known as Masked Confusion. Though, Blair was introduced as \\"Killer Bee\\" B. Brian Blair when he wrestled singles matches. The Bees also re-appeared in an American Wrestling Association event, episode of All-Star Wrestling in 1994. As of November 2017, Blair and Brunzell are still in high Demand now working many Comic-Cons and Independent Autograph Sessions. Both Blair and Brunzell have a new Comic Book Series called the \\"Killer Bee's\\" a true life story (animated) about Blair and Brunzell's journey to become Pro-wrestlers available at Inversepress.com.

(2005). \\"Chaya Shirōjirō\\" in ; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, see Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File. Members of the Chaya family, they were also centrally involved in the country's production and trade in textiles. Along with the Suminokura and Gotō families, the Chaya were one of the top merchant families in Edo period Kyoto.Crawcour, E.S. (1968). \\"Changes in Commerce in the Tokugawa Period,\\" in Studies in the Institutional History of Early Modern Japan (John Whitney Hall and Marius Jansen, eds.), pp. 191-192. Chaya Shirōjirō Kiyonobu (1545-1596) Chaya Shirōjirō Kiyonobu (1545-1596), likely the first of the line, was the son of a rōnin of the Nakajima family, descended from lords of a territory in Owari province. His father, a friend of Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiteru, was crippled in the wars of the Sengoku period. Adopted into the Chaya family, he established a humble business in Kyoto making drapes. He developed a strong business relationship with one of his clients, Matsudaira Hirotada, and later sent his son Chaya Shirōjirō Kiyonobu to Mikawa province to serve as a squire to Hirotada's son, now known as Tokugawa IeyasuSansom, George. A History of Japan: 1615-1867, p. 11. Kiyonobu thus became one of the primary suppliers of the Tokugawa family, and quickly came into great wealth and influence in Kyoto. He accompanied Ieyasu in battle, at both the Mikatagahara (1573), and served him in other ways, as an intelligence agent in Kyoto and in secretly transporting messages and goods for Ieyasu during the time when Toyotomi Hideyoshi held power. He obtained a red-seal license (shuinjō) from Hideyoshi, permitting him to trade in the ports of southern Vietnam, where he obtained silks and other goods. Chaya was supposedly the one who informed Ieyasu of Oda Nobunaga's death in 1582, and thus allowed him to escape the forces of Akechi Mitsuhide and Hideyoshi, who seized power in the aftermath. He is said to have helped design the layout of the city of Edo, and for his last year or so of life, did not leave Ieyasu's side. He repeatedly refused formal posts as governor of various Tokugawa lands, insisting that he was not a soldier, and was granted a stipend of 200 koku instead. Chaya Shirōjirō Kiyotada (1584-1603) Following Kiyonobu's death in 1596, his son Kiyotada took over the family business, and succeeded his father in his relationship with the Tokugawa lord. Kiyotada fought at the battle of Sekigahara (1600), and soon afterward was made head of all the merchants in the Kansai region, \\"with particular jurisdiction over the business community of Kyoto\\". However, Kiyotada died young, in 1603, at the age of nineteen. Chaya Shirōjirō Kiyotsugu (1584-1622) Thus, with the patronage of the shogunate behind them, the remaining brothers Kiyotsugu (1584-1622), Michizumi, and Nobumune took over the Chaya family business, worked to monopolize the trade in raw silk, and served as official suppliers of a variety of goods to the shogunate. Kiyotsugu was assigned by Ieyasu to help oversee shogunal operations at the formal trading post in Nagasaki, where he could keep an eye on the foreign traders and Christian missionaries, while working to his own commercial benefit as well. A friend of artist Honami Kōetsu, Kiyotsugu was active socially in the Kyoto art world, and was known as both a patron of the arts in general, and a collector of tea bowls and other implements of the Japanese tea ceremony.Though the Chaya family name literally means \\"teahouse\\", the family was famous as textile merchants, not for any major involvement in the production or trade of anything involving tea. Thus, Kiyotsugu's passion for tea implements, even if derived from his affection for his family name, is a curiosity. Beginning in 1612, the family obtained official licenses (shuinjō) from the shogunate to continue trade with Cochinchina (aka Dang Trong, present-day southern Vietnam); these merchant vessels thus came to be known as chaya-sen (茶屋船, \\"Chaya ships\\"). Later generations Chaya Shirōjirō Kagayoshi and Koshirō Munekiyo, heads of the family several generations later, continued to serve the shogunate, and expanded the family business, establishing branches in Kii and Owari provinces. The family suffered after the imposition of maritime restrictions by the shogunate in the 1630s, which put an end to the Annam trade, but continued to earn significant profits as core members of the itowappu system by which they enjoyed oligopolistic privileges in the silk trade. The family suffered heavy losses in 1655, as did the other itowappu merchants; the system was abolished the same year, but was later re-established in 1685. The family's fortunes continued to wane as, by 1700, it lost its special relationship with the shogunate, which could now obtain cheaper textiles from Edo-based merchants.

The seal stamps are often collected in books called that are sold at shrines and temples. The stamps are different from commemorative stamps in that they are made by people who work at the temples: Buddhist monks, or Shinto kannushi. To create the shuin, the writer presses down one or more large stamps, and then uses black ink to write, in his distinctive calligraphy, the name of the temple, the day of the visit, and other messages on and around the stamped portions. There are various theories about the origin of shuin, though the strongest is that it was a receipt for a dedicated copied sutra. There are still temples where one cannot receive a shuin without having donated a sutra or money, but the majority of the temples will now accept a small amount of money for a shuin. It usually costs 300 yen, though there are some places that charge up to 1000 yen. At Itsukushima Shrine, there is a sign that asks people to dedicate their feelings. Special shuinchō (and occasionally hanging scrolls) are available for people who do pilgrimages such as the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage and the Shikoku Pilgrimage. People who do the Shikoku pilgrimage can also get shuin on the white robes they sometimes wear. A number of Jōdo Shinshū temples do not offer shuin.

History The name Taney derives from Tigh Naithi meaning the house or place of Nahi, and who may also be associated with Tobarnea, a seashore well that near Blackrock. The current church is still in use by the local Church of Ireland community and is one of two churches in the Parish of Taney (historically encompassing the whole area around Dundrum). It is built on the site of an early Irish monastery founded by Saint NahÍ. St. Nahi's stands on the grounds of the original monastery, having been refurbished several times, most recently in 1910, after a period when it was in use as the parish boys' school. Following storm damage to the roof, a major refurbishment was carried out by the then Rector of the Parish, Canon William Monk Gibbon (father of the poet of the same name), who is buried in the grounds of the church. A plaque erected after the refurbishment reads: Items of interest The church contains some interesting artefacts including the baptismal font of the Duke of Wellington who was baptised in 1769, donated to Taney Parish in 1914 by the closing of St. Kevin’s Church in Camden Row, and altar tapestries depicting scenes from the Bible. The tapestries illustrating the Last Supper were made by the two Yeats sisters Lily and Lolly Yeats, both of whom are interred in the graveyard. Two Rathdown SlabsRathdown Slabs are displayed inside the church. These ornate burial slabs date back 1,000 years to the Viking- Christian era. Such slabs have only been found in the barony of Rathdown (the area roughly covering Churchtown to Bray). Only about 30 of these slabs have been discovered to date, these two were discovered in 2002 in the graveyard by archaeologist Chris Corlett, who had missed his bus from Dundrum and decided to explore the cemetery. Local historian John Lennon, as well as Harry Griffith, aided by Dúchas, relocated the slabs inside the church. Harry Griffith has been researching and listing the graves in St. Nahi's graveyard since 2001, compiling a comprehensive history and listing of the graveyard. Harry Griffith was interred in the graveyard after an illness on 18 April 2012. An insight into life expectancy for the area can be gleaned from the \\"Index to the Register of Burials\\" for the parish between January 1897 and April 1917 show 1,836 people buried during this period, of which 551 were children under 6 years of age. View from the LUAS bridge Graveyard Cremated remains are interred to the left of the entrance gates. This area was originally used for patients of the Dundrum Central Mental Hospital. Old records refer to this area as the Asylum Plot. A back gate to the church was only recently uncovered under much overgrowth. Although it had been used by teachers as a shortcut between the Church (when it was being used as a boys' school) and the nearby girls' school, its original function is said to have been as an entrance for Roman Catholics when attending funerals at a time when they were barred from entering the main gates of a Protestant church. Many Irish Republican graves lie within the graveyard, including the gravestones of Lorcain McSuibhne, a member of the Irish Republican Army killed in 1922 in Kildare (his funeral occurred at St. Nahi's and there exists photographic evidence of Éamon de Valera in attendance) and of James Burke, who was killed in Croke Park on Bloody Sunday. The graveyard also contains many Royal Irish Constabulary Officers and Freemasons. There is one War grave. Sgt. William Anthony Kavanagh, RAF Volunteer Reserve, age 24, died 23 sept 1944 as a result of a cycling accident while home on holiday, son of William and Mary Kavanagh of Balally. The site also contains the grave of the Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney, who died in London in 1911. His ashes were brought back to be with his wife, mother and sister. His cousin Robert Stoney was a local curate when his wife died. Currently over 10,000 burials have been recorded, with the earliest visible gravestone dating back to 1734. The Parish of Taney: a History of Dundrum, Near Dublin, and its NeighbourhoodThe Parish of Taney (Ball & Hamilton) published in 1895, claims that there are “tens of thousands” of burials within the graveyard, a credible figure considering its age. As the churchyard predates the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1869, it is open for burial to all those who live within the boundaries of the Parish of Taney, whatever their denomination. Organ The organ of St. Nahi's was built by the renowned Irish organ-builder William Telford. However, St. Nahi's was not its original home. The organ was only installed there in the 1990s. The church used a harmonium (which is still there) to lead congregational singing. The organ has one manual, pedal of limited compass and seven stops.

It is a 5-star Scottish Tourist Board attraction, as of 2019, the only one in Aberdeen. History The museum is located in a 19th-century house which was purchased by the Scottish artist, Sir George Reid in 1867, and in which he lived and worked. It was acquired by the War Office in 1960 and then, after being transferred to the ownership of the trustees of the regiment in 1994, it was extended and re-opened as a museum in 1997. Location and facilities The museum is located in an angle of Viewfield Road, near a stream. It has a tea room facility, a volunteer-maintained garden, and both the museum and the garden can be rented as event venues. The collection The museum contains historical artefacts, memorabilia and regimental silverware. Within the building are a main gallery - the Grant Room - and a display of edged weapons and guns in the Armoury, along with a mock-up of the Regimental Officers' Mess, a Silver Room and an exhibition space. Works by Sir George Reid are on loan from the city, and are displayed in various locations. A replica of a First World War trench was opened in 2019, and a 50% growth in visitor numbers followed.

Concept Viking XPRS is Viking Line's first new building for the Helsinki–Tallinn route. She is the first newbuilding delivered to the company since MS Kalypso in 1990 and also Viking Line's first fast cruiseferry, with a building contract worth approximately 120–130 million euros.Letter of intent between Aker Yards and Viking Line confirmed, retrieved 2008-01-09 The Viking XPRS makes the crossing between the two capitals in about two and a half hours, with two daily departures from each port. The ship is designed with separate cardecks for freight and for passengers cars, and with a limited passenger cabin capacity as she only does daytime crossings. The interiors of the Viking XPRS were designed by Tillberg Design, like those of several of the company's earlier newbuildings.Tillberg Design XPRS page, retrieved 2007-12-19 In April 2009 the Viking XPRS won the award for Outstanding Ferry Exterior in ShipPax Awards 2009, held as a part of the Shipping 2009 conference in France. =Planned sister ships= The order of the Viking XPRS included an option for two sister vessels.

The naming ceremony took place on 14 September 2007. Viking XPRS under construction at Helsinki New Shipyard The ship was originally planned to be registered in Finland, with Mariehamn painted on the hull as the home port when the ship was floated out of dry dock. Due to difficulties in negotiations with the Finnish Seamen's Union and the generally higher personnel expenses under Finnish flag, the company decided to move the ship under Swedish flag in January 2008. In March 2008 Norrtälje in Sweden was revealed as the port of registry. But from 24 January 2014 Viking XPRS started sailing under Estonian flag, as it cuts costs for Viking Line. Because of that the ship got a new Estonian crew and all of the signs were replaced from Swedish to Estonian and English. The new home port is Tallinn. Construction Viking XPRS was built at Aker Finnyards' Helsinki New Shipyard. The original delivery date of the ship was set for January 2008, but due to numerous delays the delivery of the ship was pushed back until 28 April 2008. Reasons for the delays included slower-than- planned furnishing works and faults in one of the Rolls-Royce-manufactured propellers. Due to the propeller fault the ship sailed for dry docking at Aker Finnyards' Rauma shipyard on 8 April 2008 where the propeller was changed. The ship was eventually delivered to Viking Line on 21 April 2008. Service history Viking XPRS made her maiden voyage between Helsinki and Tallinn on 27 April 2008 and entered regular service on the route the following day. Compared to that had sailed on the route the previous year the Viking XPRS attracted a notably larger number of passengers, with a 61% raise in passenger number and 74% raise in vehicles transported between Helsinki and Tallinn between June and August 2008 compared to the same months in 2007. During her first year in service, the ship transported approximately 1,466,000 passengers - more than any other ship that has trafficked in the northern Baltic Sea. In February 2009 the Viking XPRS was voted as one of the top 5 medium-sized cruise ships in the world by readers of the prestigious Condé Nast Traveler guide, rating higher than the ships of Holland America Line amongst others. Viking XPRS gained top spot in the \\"shore excursions\\" category, despite the fact the ship offers no organised excursions. In addition to the fact that the Viking XPRS is not an actual cruise ship, this led to the proposition that the ship's high placement in the ranking was in fact the result of a hoax of some kind. On 24 January 2014 Viking XPRS was re-flagged to Estonia, right after returning from repairs which started on 13 January. MS Viking XPRS is the first ship in Viking Line's history to sail under Estonian flag. Decks The ship has ten decks but not all are accessible to passengers.

So far, only a few countries in the world have decided to choose such a currency regime. in 2002 as its de facto domestic currency. This means that the euro is not a legal tender there, however it is treated as such by the government and the population.  History  In the early 20th century, during the short-lived Kingdom of Montenegro, the government introduced the Montenegrin perper from 1906 to 1918. However, other foreign currencies were used in parallel, such as the Austrian krone. From 1922 to 1941, as part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later known as Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Montenegro used the country's official currency, the Yugoslav dinar. = Yugoslav Dinar = 5000 dinar banknote (1985) After Montenegro became a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia following World War II, it was bound to Yugoslav monetary policy and used the Yugoslav dinar as its official currency until 1999.Fabris, N. (2014) “The History of Money in Montenegro”, Central Bank of Montenegro and Faculty of Economics, Belgrade University. Journal of Central Banking Theory and Practice, pp. 5-18 After the disintegration of the SFRY, in 1992 the former member republics – Montenegro and Serbia formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the new country, the monetary system was re-centralized, wherein the National Bank of Montenegro lost its autonomy and became a regional office of the National Bank of Yugoslavia headquartered in Belgrade.Liebscher, K., Christl, J., Mooslechner, P., Ritzberger-Grünwald, D. (2005) “European Economic Integration And South-East Europe: Challenges And Prospects”, Edward Elgar Pub, pp. 155-176 A high level of monetary and financial centralisation was established, which was easy to be manipulated and which enabled many misuses due to the nonexistence of any legal state and financial discipline, and this resulted in hyperinflation in the period 1992–94.Bogetic, Z., Petrovic, P., Vujosevic, Z.,(1999) “The Yugoslav Hyperinflation of 1992-1994: Causes, Dynamics, and Money Supply Process”, After the crash of the common market and simultaneous outbreaks of war in two former Yugoslav republics, the monthly inflation rate in Serbia and Montenegro was 50% in February 1992, reaching 100% in June the same year.Bogetic, Z., Petrovic, P., Vujosevic, Z.,(1999) “The Yugoslav Hyperinflation of 1992-1994: Causes, Dynamics, and Money Supply Process”, This caused severe and prolonged hyperinflation, which has led to a devastation of the region. The Yugoslav dinar has been considered one of the worst-performing currencies of the world. = Deutsche Mark = 100 Mark At the beginning of 1999, the government started looking for a way to protect economic interests of Montenegro and its monetary independence. The government established a dual currency system, in which both the dinar and Deutsche Mark would be used. The decision for that was mainly driven by an unstable, expansionary monetary policy stance of the National Bank of Yugoslavia.Ö. Olgu (2011) \\"European Banking: Enlargement, Structural Changes and Recent Developments\\". Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions.Regulation on the Use of the German Mark as the Means of Payment With a View to Protecting the Economic Interests of Montenegro (Official Gazette of the RM, no. 41/99 and 22/00)/Службен весник на РМ, бр. 41/99 и 22/00 The introduction of dollarization, as well as the improvement of the situation in the monetary, financial and banking sectors of Montenegro resulted in increasing citizensʼ confidence in the new monetary regime.Liebscher, K., Christl, J., Mooslechner, P., Ritzberger-Grünwald, D. (2005) “European Economic Integration And South-East Europe: Challenges And Prospects”, Edward Elgar Pub, pp. 155-176 Since January 2001 the country decided to take the Deutsche Mark as a sole legal tender. Since January 2001 the country decided to take this currency as a sole legal tender, because a sufficient amount of Deutsche Mark were in circulation, and for this reason there was no need to use the Dinar as the national currency. = Euro = Euro coins and banknotes of various denominations On 1 January 2002 the euro notes and coins were officially introduced into circulation in many European countries, including Germany, where the Deutsche Mark used to be an official currency. Thus the Deutsche Mark ceased to be legal tender immediately upon the adoption of the euro. Following these events in the beginning of 2002 Montenegro took a decision to officially and unilaterally adopt the euro, first as a parallel legal tender to the Deutsche Mark, and since June 2002 as the only legal tender.Razmi, A.,(2018) “Montenegro's Unilateral Euroization”, UMASS Amherst Economics Working Papers 2018-13, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Department of Economics. The main motives were the same as before - to ensure monetary stability and to continue to avoid high/hyper inflation in the preceding decades.Winkler, A., Mazzaferro, F., Nerlich, C., Thimann, C., (2004). \\"Official dollarisation/euroisation - motives, features and policy implications of current cases.\\" Occasional Paper, European Central Bank. To date there are no official ties or agreements between Montenegro and the European Central Bank approving the use of the euro as an official currency.  Coins  Each of the euro-area countries have a common reverse, portraying a map of Europe, but some of them have its own design on the obverse, which means that each coin has a variety of different designs in circulation at once. Four European microstates (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City)Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City have formal agreements with the EU to use the euro as their official currency and issue their own coins. which use the euro as their currency also have the right to mint coins with their own designs on the obverse side. Unlike the members of the Eurozone, Montenegro has no authority to mint euro coins of its own and therefore does not have its own national side of the coins in use. Rather, they depend on bills and coins already in circulation.  The EU position  When Montenegro started using euro as a national currency, the European Central Bank initially did not object to this step. Since then, however, the European Commission and the ECB have expressed dissatisfaction with Montenegro's unilateral use of the euro, with European Commission spokesperson Amelia Torres saying in 2007 that \\"The conditions for the adoption of the euro are clear. That means, first and foremost, to be a member of the EU.\\" Also in the Declaration attached to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU is written that: \\"unilateral introduction of the euro is not compatible with the Treaty.\\" In spite of the fact that in 2010 Montenegro obtained the status of the official candidate, the European Union continued to raise the question of Montenegro abolishing the euro. Later on euroisation however was acknowledged by the European Commission through a specific approach, which takes into account euroisation happened due to “extraordinary circumstances” present in the country at the moment of introducing the euro. As a result of that, Montenegro still continue to use the euro currency as its legal tender and hopes to join the European Union as soon as possible.  Montenegrin position  Central Bank of Montenegro officials have indicated on several occasions that the European institutions expect Montenegro to adhere very strictly to ERM rules, as a part of the accession procedures to the European Union. In 2009 Nikola Fabris, chief economist of the Central Bank of Montenegro, has said that the situation was different when they adopted the euro, and that other states which on a later stage also had been considering unilaterally adopting the euro, such as Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, would have faced sanctions from the EU and would have their accession process suspended if they would have gone ahead. The dispute regarding the use of the euro was expected to be resolved by analysts during the accession negotiations. Diplomats indicated that it is unlikely that Montenegro will be forced to stop the circulation of the euro in their country. In 2013 Radoje Zugi, the finance minister of Montenegro, said that \\"it would be economically irrational to return to a currency of your own, only to be back in the euro later\\". Instead, he hopes that Montenegro will be allowed to keep the euro, and he promised \\"that the government of Montenegro will meet some important conditions to keep the euro, such as fiscal compliance\\".  Current status  In 2007 Montenegro signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union, then submitted its application for membership in December 2008 and finally obtained the status of official candidate in 2010. In 2012, Montenegro became the first country from the current six Western Balkan states to start accession negotiations with the EU and to date, according to many officials, it is a frontrunner on the path towards the EU membership. As a part of the ongoing negotiations, the EU will have to deal with this unprecedented case in which a state, already using the common currency without implementing all the mandatory economic conditions, is striving to join the EU and the Eurozone. These conditions (convergence criteria) are set out in Article 140 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to ensure that a certain country is ready for integration into the monetary regime of the euro area. There are 4 economic convergence criteria: #Price stability: The inflation rate cannot be higher than 1.5 percentage points above the rate of the 3 best-performing member states. #Sound and sustainable public finances: Government deficit cannot be higher than 3% of GDP. Government debt cannot be higher than 60% of GDP. #Exchange-rate stability: The candidate has to participate in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) for at least 2 years without strong deviations from the ERM II central rate and without devaluing its currency's bilateral central rate against the euro in the same period. #Long-term interest rates: The long-term interest rate should not be higher than 2 percentage points above the rate of the 3 best-performing member states in terms of price stability. Additionally to that, to join the euro area candidates must also ensure that their national laws and rules provide for the independence of their national central banks, and that their statutes are in compliance with the provisions of the treaties and compatible with the statutes of the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks. The Maastricht Treaty provides that all members of the European Union will eventually join the euro area, once the convergence criteria have been met. To date, the path of Montenegro to the European Union and subsequently to the Eurozone membership is still unclear. Some experts are of an opinion that in situation like this the convergence criteria should be set as an additional prerequisite for Montenegro's membership in the European Union and should be complied with before the country joins the Union.

History G-CPSH attending at scene of RTC on the A505 at Offley Grange G-CPSH taking off from the scene of a RTC on the A505 at Offley Grange Before 1980, Thames Valley Police occasionally used helicopters at special events. In 1963, Oxford City Police experimented using a Brantley helicopter with a dog basket attached to the skids. In 1980, an aircraft was used on twenty separate days at various events, with further use taking place during 1981. It was not until June 1982 that the first formally contracted flights took place. During the next four years the helicopter was used more frequently. A single engine Aerospatiale A350 Squirrel helicopter designated G-JORR was hired for day-time operations for each weekday of 1985. This aircraft was based at Oxford Airport and used exclusively by the Thames Valley Police. Seven sergeants were drawn from the Traffic and Operations Departments as part-time observers. During April 1986, the Thames Valley Police Air Support Unit, as it had become known, was relocated to RAF Abingdon. Providing daylight cover only, the Unit was allocated a budget of 650 flying hours, but was still crewed by sergeant observers on an ad hoc basis. It was recognised that the specialist skills required could no longer be met by part-time observers, and in 1988 the decision was taken to recruit and train dedicated observers. The unit was renamed to the Chiltern Air Support Unit in 1996. Chiltern Air Support's Luton helicopter (EC135T2 CPDS) moved from London Luton Airport to RAF Henlow, near Hitchin and Shillington. The helicopter was upgraded in 2001, and reached 10,000 hours of flying in September 2011. It operated using the call-sign XA99. Chiltern's other helicopter (EC135T1CDS) is based at RAF Benson near Wallingford in Oxfordshire. An order was made to replace the current helicopter due to changes in the law. It is now a requirement that the aircraft should have an Autopilot to make operations safer. In October 2010, the helicopter was exchanged with another Eurocopter EC135P2+ registered G-TVHB. It operated using the call-sign XA97. National Police Air Service On 1 October 2012, the Chiltern Air Support Unit was taken over by the newly created National Police Air Service. Only the Benson staff employed by the Chiltern Air Support Unit were seconded to West Yorkshire Police, who are the lead force for the NPAS. Aircraft and staff at the RAF Henlow site were disbanded and did not join NPAS, despite concerns being expressed by the Thames Valley Police Federation and a UK Government and Parliament petition being launched to protect the base.

The lower deck connects Riverfront Avenue in Chinatown with Memorial Drive, while the upper elevated deck crosses Memorial Drive as well, reaching into the community of Crescent Heights. Centre Street Bridge is the central point of the quadrant system of the city. History Centre Street Bridge under construction in 1915 It was built by The City of Calgary in 1916 for $375,000. It replaced the MacArthur Bridge, a steel truss bridge built in 1907 by a land developer called the Centre Street Bridge Company Limited The MacArthur Bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1915. Centre Street Bridge was designed by John F. Green, and features an upper and lower deck, cantilevered balconies on the upper deck, and four large cast concrete lions atop two pairs of ornamental concrete pavilions flanking each end of the bridge. The lions were cast by Scottish mason James L. Thomson. They were modelled after the bronze lions by Landseer at the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London. The pavilions are ornamented with symbols of Canada and the United Kingdom: buffalo heads, maple leaves, shamrocks (Ireland), roses (England), and thistles (Scotland). The upper deck, a reinforced concrete arch structure, spans and is wide. The lower deck, an \\"I\\" girders structure, runs for and is wide. The Centre Street Bridge was listed as a Municipal Historic Resource for Calgary in 1992. The bridge went through extensive restoration in 2001, when it was closed for one year. The lower deck is configured with reversible lanes. The original lions were replaced with replicas after considerable debate. Local legends of adjacent Chinatown hold that the lions would come alive after dark and roam the city streets. One of the original lions is now located at City Hall, the remaining three are in long-term storage. In April 2013, a city committee voted unanimously to place the remaining lions at one or more of the new West LRT C-Train (tram) stations. Other information The lower deck of the bridge has a clearance of only . Inattentive drivers get their trucks, RVs, and vans stuck on the narrow 2-lane lower deck of the bridge, blocking traffic. An advanced warning system was installed on the bridge approaches in 2010, cutting the number of incidents in half, but roughly 20 vehicles a year continue to get stuck. The opening scene of the 2001 Steven Seagal movie Exit Wounds was filmed on the bridge.

Palazzo Muti Papazzurri in 2010. Palazzo Muti Papazzurri is a Baroque palazzo in Rome, Italy. It was built in 1660 by the architect Mattia de' Rossi, a pupil of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It is thought it was constructed for the newly married Pompeo Muti Papazzurri and Maria Isabella Massimo. A print of 1699 shows a large townhouse built around an open cour d'honneur, the court being entered through a triumphal arch at the centre of a Baroque screen linking the two flanking wings. The screen still remains but has today had rooms built above it, thus completely altering the open appearance of the palazzo to a plain closed façade. During the 18th century the palazzo formed the centre of a family complex of properties which were rented in their entirety to the Stuarts, pretenders to the British throne; thus for a time the palazzo was the home of a court in exile.Jacobite Gazetteer In 1909 the palazzo was heavily restored which has changed de' Rossi's architectural concept of the original design by removing the pediments to the windows and the statuary decorating the roofline. The 17th and 18th century interior decoration of the palazzo has been preserved complete with their frescoed ceilings. The gallery, one of the principal reception rooms, has frescos depicting scenes from classical mythology attributed to Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi and Niccolò Berrettoni. Grimaldi was one of the most fashionable painters of his day having worked extensively for Cardinal Mazarin. Today the palazzo houses the Pontifical Biblical Institute.

She was born as Eva Isabella Henrietta Hanbury-Tracy, the eldest child of the 4th Lord Sudeley. She grew up in Gloucestershire at Toddington Manor, near Tewkesbury. Her two immediate siblings were boys and she grew up a somewhat lonely child, resorting to creative writing from a young age. She cultivated a wide circle of similar-minded friends and began writing seriously at age 14. As an adult, she had some success with poems, newspaper columns, short stories, one play and several novels. She had a special \\"den\\" in her home where she would sit and read or write. Sometimes in London she would go to Clifford's Inn, where she had a small personal office. She wrote a play, Bon Secours, in 1903. She may have written another play, Old Clothes, mentioned in a collectors' item manuscript - a letter written in March 1904 by Thomas Anstey Guthrie (1856–1934), who is also known as F. Anstey. Personal life She married Henry Torrens Anstruther in 1889. However, his political career did not go well and he never became a cabinet minister. They separated in 1912 and divorced in 1915. They had two children, Douglas and Joyce. During the First World War, she was appointed by Sir Edward Ward as Director of the Camps Library, started on 1 October 1914, and was responsible for stocking the libraries for troops on active duty in France. Her title was Honorary Director of the Camps Library, for which service she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1918 - on Ward's recommendation.

History =Raising= In 1823 and 1824 the size of the British Army was increased by the raising of six regiments of foot, numbered the 94th-99th. The raising of the 97th Regiment was authorised by a royal warrant dated 25 March 1824: the colonelcy was given to Major General Sir James Lyon, with the headquarters to be established at Gosport. It was the sixth regiment of foot to have borne the number \\"97\\", the others having been short-lived war-raised units that existed at various periods during the Seven Years' War, the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. On 30 March the headquarters of the regiment were moved to Winchester, by which time recruiting parties were active throughout the United Kingdom. By June 1824 the regiment had been brought up to full strength. =\\"Earl of Ulster's\\"= Prince Frederick, Earl of Ulster The bulk of the regiment was recruited in Ireland, and it was initially regarded as an Irish unit. This led to it being given sky blue facings derived from the colour of the ribbon of the Order of St Patrick. The colour of the facings led to the 97th gaining the nickname The Celestials. The Irish connection was reinforced in September 1826 when the regiment was granted the additional title of \\"Earl of Ulster's\\". This was an additional title in the Peerage of Ireland borne by Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. The Latin motto Quo fas et gloria ducunt was granted to the regiment in the following month. =Service to 1854= Soon after its formation the 97th Foot was ordered to Ceylon to relieve the 45th (Nottinghamshire Sherwood Foresters) Regiment of Foot. They arrived in 1825, and were to spend 11 years on the island. In November 1832, the regiment's cricket team played the Colombo Cricket Club at the Rifle Green in Colombo, in the first recorded cricket match in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). The regiment returned to the United Kingdom in 1836, arriving at Portsmouth aboard in September. From 1836 to 1841 the regiment was stationed at various garrisons in England and Ireland. In 1841 the regiment sailed from Cork for the Ionian Islands, and was stationed at Corfu until 1847. They moved to Malta in 1847 before departing for Halifax, Nova Scotia in the following year, relieving the 23rd (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot. The regiment returned to England in May 1853. By March 1854 it seemed inevitable that war would break out with the Russian Empire, and the 97th Foot were ordered to \\"hold themselves in readiness\\" to proceed to the Crimea. The regiment formed part of an expeditionary force that left Southampton in May 1854. They found themselves diverted to Greece, where they formed part of an Anglo-French occupation force suppressing the Uprising in Epirus. In November 1854 they were selected as one of six infantry battalions to form reinforcements for the forces in the Crimea. =Crimean War= The Attack on the Redan by Robert Alexander Hillingford The 97th Foot landed at Balaklava on 20 November 1854. They took part in the Siege of Sevastopol and the Battle of the Great Redan. It was on 22 March 1855, during the Siege of Sevastopol, that Captain Hedley Vicars of the 97th lost his life. Vicars was mentioned in despatches on 6 April by Lord Raglan, and was the subject of a posthumous book. The regiment suffered heavy casualties, with two members subsequently being awarded the newly created Victoria Cross in 1857: *Sergeant John Coleman for actions at Sevatopol on 30 August 1855. *Brevet Major Charles Henry Lumley for actions at the Redan on 8 September 1855. Following the end of the war, the 97th Regiment returned to England, arriving in July 1856. =Indian Mutiny= The 97th Foot's time in England was to be short: in May 1857 a rebellion broke out among native soldiers of the East India Company. In July it was announced that the 97th were among six infantry battalions to be sent to India as reinforcements. The regiment arrived in Bombay in November 1857. In April 1858 they joined the British forces that lifted the Siege of Lucknow. The regiment subsequently took part in minor operations at Fort Nusrutpore, Chanda, Umeerpore and Sultanpore before the ending of the conflict in June 1858. =Garrison duty to 1881= The 97th remained in India until 1867. They returned to the United Kingdom, spending six years at various stations in England and Ireland. In May 1873 the regiment sailed from Queenstown for the West Indies. They were stationed in Jamaica from 1873 to 1875 and in Bermuda from 1875 to 1877. =Amalgamation= In March 1872 a major reorganisation of the line infantry was announced. All single-battalion regiments of foot were to be paired, sharing a permanent depot and a geographical recruiting area. One battalion was to be on \\"foreign\\" and one on \\"home\\" service at any time. It was originally proposed that the 97th be paired with the 103rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Bombay Fusiliers) with a depot at Guildford in Surrey. This proved controversial, the 97th Foot still being regarded as an Irish regiment with no connection to England. The pairing was eventually changed, with the 97th being linked with the 50th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Foot. The 97th's Irish connection was ended, however, with the two regiments assigned to district no. 46 at Maidstone Barracks and a \\"sub- district\\" consisting of part of the county of Kent. On 1 August 1881, under the Childers Reforms, the 50th and 97th Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment). Following further amalgamations in 1961, 1966 and 1992, its lineage is continued by the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment.

The Edwardes family owned extensive lands in Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire and on the death of his cousin the 7th Earl in 1721 and his elder brother in 1738, William inherited the additional estates of the Rich family, which included Holland House in Kensington. In 1776 he was created Baron Kensington in the Peerage of Ireland. This was a revival of the barony held by the Earls of Warwick and Holland which had become extinct on the death of the eighth and last Earl in 1759. Edwardes was elected to his father's old seat of Haverfordwest in 1747, a seat he held until 1801, with a brief exception between 1784 and 1786. His tenure as member for Haverfordwest was based on an arrangement with Lord Milford, the member for the Pembrokeshire county constituency, whose family treated Haverfordwest like a pocket borough. Lord Kensington died in 1801. He had firstly married his cousin Rachel, the daughter of Owen Edwardes of Trefgarn but after her death in 1760 he had married Elizabeth Warren in 1762. He was succeeded in the barony by their only son William, who also succeeded him as Member of Parliament for Haverfordwest. Lady Kensington died in November 1814.

Cowdin would serve as Universal's President and Chairman of its Board of Directors until 1946. Comedian Groucho Marx played a lawyer based on Cowdin in the 1939 film ‘At the Circus’. The character was named “J. Cheever Loophole”. A director of Curtiss-Wright, Cowdin was considered a leader in aviation financing, notably associated with fellow financier George Newell Armsby in the investment house of Blair & Co., which merged with BancAmerica to form Bancamerica-Blair in 1931. Through Armsby, Cowdin was associated with aviation pioneer (and friend of Amelia Earhart) Floyd Odlum. Cowdin served as chairman of the Committee on Government Finance of the National Association of Manufacturers.New York Times - August 14, 1942 Cowdin was married three times in the course of his life. He married his first wife, Florence Hopkins, in 1912; they divorced in 1926. Their union produced a son, John Cheever Cowdin, Jr. who in 1946 committed suicide at age 33 while in Nassau, Bahamas.New York Times - November 21, 1946 According to the New York Times, Cowdin later married Katherine Andrea Parker Berens on December 30, 1941, in Yuma, Arizona. As a prominent American, the TIME magazine reported Cowdin's 1929 marriage to Manhattan socialite divorcee, Mrs. Katherine McCutcheon Abbott, in Bristol, Maine during a cruise on his yacht, Surf. He died on September 16, 1960. Equine sportsman J. Cheever Cowdin served as president of Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York. In 1941, the track renamed its Junior Champion Stakes Thoroughbred horse race to the Cowdin Stakes in his honor. He was termed by Esquire Magazine not only one of the best-dressed men of his era, but \\"one of the Big Four of polo from the time of the great Tommy Hitchcock.\\" The International Polo Club Palm Beach lists him on a 1927 team with W. Averell Harriman and Tommy Hitchcock.

Dan- Air Engineering was established in 1954 at Lasham Airfield to maintain the fledgling airline's rapidly growing fleet as well as to cater to the maintenance requirements of third parties. The organisation embarked on a major expansion during the 1970s, following the introduction of several new aircraft types into its sister airline's fleet. This led to the opening of a new maintenance base at Manchester. Further expansion followed in the 1980s, leading to the opening of a new widebody-capable maintenance facility at Gatwick, its sister airline's main operating base. Following its sister airline's adoption of a new corporate strategy at the beginning of the 1990s, which resulted in a simpler, less maintenance-intensive fleet mix, Dan-Air Engineering was put up for sale as its capacity exceeded the sister airline's maintenance requirements by 45%.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 182Dan-Air shanghais Cathay manager, Air Transport, Flight International, 12–18 February 1992, p. 11 FLS Aerospace acquired Dan-Air Engineering on 28 February 1991 for £27.5 million.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 183Dan-Air Engineering sold to FLS Group, Business, Flight International, 16–22 January 1991, p. 13 History Dan-Air's growing and varied fleet necessitated the development of a comprehensive 'in-house' maintenance capability from the very beginning itself. This led to the establishment of sister company Dan-Air Engineering in 1954, the airline's second year of operation. =A new maintenance base= Following Dan-Air's acquisition of three Avro Yorks in 1954, the airline selected Lasham Airfield, a former Royal Air Force World War II airfield near the northeast Hampshire town of Basingstoke, as its maintenance base due to the ample availability of hangar space.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 15Airline Profile: Number Forty-Three in the Series – Dan-Air, Flight International, 31 May 1973, p. 836 (Meredith Air Transport, whose operation at Southend Dan-Air had taken over at the time of its formation, lacked adequate maintenance facilities at that airport. When the fledgling airline moved its operating base to Blackbushe in 1955, it continued to face a shortage of adequate maintenance facilities as Airwork, Britavia, Eagle, Silver City and Westminster Airways, whose presence at the airport predated Dan-Air's, had already occupied most of the available hangar space. Blackbushe's lack of space resulted from its earlier use as a military airfield where no provision had been made for future commercial operations. The airport's biggest drawback was its location on both sides of the A30 along the Hampshire-Surrey county border, with the terminal and apron to the north and the maintenance area to the south, and taxiways as well as one of the runways crossing it. This arrangement necessitated frequent closures of the busy road on account of aircraft moving across it, thereby preventing the efficient use of both road and airport as well as ruling out the latter's expansion.Airliner Classics (Dan-Air – Popular British Charter operator: Southend to Blackbushe), Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, November 2011, p. 90) At the time, Lasham Airfield was in excellent condition, featuring a newly resurfaced runway and a large, empty hangar. (The Air Ministry had decided to upgrade the airfield following the end of the Berlin Airlift in preparation for further Cold War tensions.) Eventually, Davies and Newman, the parent company of both the airline and its new engineering offshoot, managed to negotiate a 21-year lease of the airfield's maintenance facilities with the Air Ministry.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 16 =Major expansion in the 1970s and early- to mid-1980s= de Havilland Comet 4C sister airline Dan- Air acquired from Kuwait Airways in 1971, seen here in 1974. Comet 4C G-BDIX, seen here on display at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune, Scotland. Dan-Air Engineering's first phase of major expansion occurred at Lasham, following sister company Dan-Air's purchase of a pair of de Havilland Comet series 4 jetliners from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in 1966.Airliner World (The Last of Dan-Air's Comets – Dan-Air and the Comet), Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, November 2010, p. 69 These aircraft were ferried from BOAC's Heathrow base to Lasham during the early summer of that year for a six-month conversion by Dan-Air Engineering from a 74-seat, low-density, two- class long-haul scheduled configuration into a 106-seat, high-density, single- class short- to medium-haul inclusive tour (IT) layout.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 47, 63Airline Profile: Number Forty-Three in the Series – Dan-Air, Flight International, 31 May 1973, p. 839Airliner World (The Last of Dan-Air's Comets – Dan-Air and the Comet), Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, November 2010, p. 70Aviation News (Dan-Air's Comets – Second-hand stalwarts: Inclusive tours), Key Publishing, Bourne, UK, July 2017, p. 19 This conversion involved structurally \\"reinforcing\\" the aircraft — including strengthening the cabin floor and the wing roots – as they were expected to perform many more takeoffs and landings after entering service with Dan-Air (compared with their original role at BOAC). It also involved replacing internal doors with curtains as a weight-saving measure. Subsequently, acquired, larger Comet series 4B and 4C aircraft underwent similar structural modifications to enable them to carry up to 119 passengers before entering service with sister airline Dan-Air.Airliner World (The Last of Dan-Air's Comets – Additional Comets), Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, November 2010, pp. 71–73 BAC One-Eleven 300s sister airline Dan-Air acquired in 1969 following British Eagle's bankruptcy, seen here passing behind a Britannia Airways Boeing 737-200 at Manchester Airport in 1972.

This meant that it could perform maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) tasks on aircraft that were on the US civil aircraft register and/or were governed by US airworthiness standards.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 147 Boeing 727-100s sister airline Dan-Air acquired from Japan Airlines in 1972, seen here in 1974 (note the additional emergency door at the rear of the fuselage). Dan-Air's decision to become the first British operator of the Boeing 727 resulted in the purchase of three 100 series examples from Japan Airlines (JAL) in 1972. As these aircraft lacked high frequency (HF) radios, they needed to be flown across the Pacific with two intermediate 24-hour stops at Wake Island and Honolulu (where the aircraft refuelled and waited for the overflight of the next scheduled Tokyo – Los Angeles Boeing 747 service to provide navigational assistance for the next stage of the onward journey until Los Angeles was reached).JAL crews ferried each aircraft from Tokyo via Wake Island, Honolulu and Los Angeles to Seattle Boeing Field After reaching the US, they underwent an extensive modification programme at Boeing's Wichita plant in Kansas to comply with British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (BCAR). These modifications entailed the installation of two additional emergency doors each side of the rear fuselage and a full stall-protection system, including a stick pusher. Following their arrival in the UK at Dan-Air Engineering's Lasham base,via Gatwick each aircraft was fitted with new galleys manufactured by Dan-Air Engineering together with 150 seats. The aircraft were also repainted at Lasham prior to their entry into service with Dan-Air in 1973.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 122, 236First British 727 ready, Air Transport, Flight International, 29 March 1973, p. 500 By the mid-1970s, Dan-Air Engineering's workforce had expanded to more than 800, the vast majority of whom were based at Lasham. BAC One-Eleven 500s sister airline Dan-Air acquired in 1974 following Court Line's bankruptcy, seen here at Pisa Airport in 1975. The continuing, rapid expansion of the Dan-Air fleet during the 1970s as well as growing third-party work during that period resulted in the opening of Dan-Air Engineering's second maintenance base at Manchester Airport in 1976. The new Manchester base took over Lasham's maintenance of Dan-Air's One-Eleven and Hawker Siddeley 748 fleets. It also developed third- party de Havilland Canada Dash 7 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 maintenance capabilities, as a result of which Lasham began to specialise in the maintenance of all Boeing narrow-bodied aircraft types.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 92, 147 Eventually, Dan-Air Engineering became the second biggest employer at Manchester Airport (after the airport authority).The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 148 Dan-Air had its entire 17-strong One- Eleven fleet hush-kitted at Dan-Air Engineering's Manchester base by the end of 1985.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 92Air Transport, Flight International, 14 April 1984, p. 992 By the late-1980s, Dan-Air Engineering's total workforce had almost doubled to 1,500.Commercial Manager ... Dan-Air – Engineering Division, Marketplace – Aerospace Appointments, Flight International, 13 August 1988, p. 100 (This was in addition to Dan-Air's 3,000-strong workforce at the time, resulting in a total employee strength of 4,500 for the entire Davies and Newman group during that period.) =Further expansion in the late-1980s= On 28 February 1989 Dan-Air Engineering opened its third base at London Gatwick, its sister airline Dan-Air's main operating base since 1960. At that time Dan-Air Engineering maintained over 100 aircraft, including Dan-Air's 50-strong fleet.Avionics Engineers – Gatwick ... Dan-Air – Engineering Division, Marketplace – Aerospace Appointments, Flight International, 28 January 1989, p. 67 The new Gatwick maintenance base featured Dan-Air Engineering's first and only widebody-capable hangar (located at the airport's northwest side).Dan-Air's space shop, Flight International, 13 May 1989, p. 12Skyport (... but Virgin want it for its plane space), Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 4 August 2006 Princess Alexandra conducted the official opening ceremony for Dan-Air Engineering's new hangar at Gatwick Airport on 18 April 1989.Airliner Classics (Dan-Air – Popular British Charter operator: Gatwick's new hangar), Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, November 2011, p. 95 The Gatwick hangar could handle all Western-built widebodied aircraft — including the Boeing 747, then the world's largest widebodied airliner in commercial airline service. Davies and Newman's decision to establish a new, widebody-capable maintenance facility operated by maintenance subsidiary Dan-Air Engineering at airline subsidiary Dan-Air's Gatwick base was taken in response to the following events: * Gatwick had experienced rapid growth since the late-1970s, with an increasing number of movements at the airport accounted for by widebodied aircraft, including those operated by US carriers on transatlantic scheduled services. * The collapse of Laker Airways, Gatwick's largest resident operator of widebodied equipment since the early-70s, during the early part of the 1980s had led to the concentration of all widebody-capable hangarage and associated maintenance capabilities in the hands of British Caledonian. British Caledonian was the airport's largest resident operator and its leading scheduled airline, which also happened to be the main transatlantic competitor of most of the Gatwick-based US carriers. The result was a shortage of independently owned/operated, widebody-capable maintenance facilities at Gatwick. (The unease of these US carriers at having to rely on widebody- capable maintenance facilities controlled by their main transatlantic competitor for their Gatwick operations grew when British Airways, a far bigger as well as operationally and financially stronger airline than British Caledonian, inherited these facilities as a result of its takeover of that airline during the latter part of the 1980s.) Airbus A300 B4 series sister airline Dan-Air acquired from Hapag-Lloyd in 1986 and 1988 respectively. G-BMNC (ex-D-AMAX), the aircraft seen here taxiing towards its stand at London Gatwick in March 1990, entered service with Dan-Air in August 1988. * Since the beginning of the 1980s Dan- Air itself had been looking at introducing aircraft that were more advanced and had a greater seating capacity than the Boeing 727-200 Advanced, the largest contemporary aircraft in the airline's fleet, to combat rising jet fuel prices and to make the best use of Gatwick's increasingly scarce early morning peak time slots. This led to the evaluation of the Boeing 757 and several other state-of-the-art, high-capacity narrow- and widebodied aircraft types.Three-type fleet for Dan-Air, Air Transport, Flight International, 1 December 1979, p1818 That evaluation process resulted in the introduction of a 336-seat ex-Hapag-Lloyd Airbus A300 B4 series widebodied aircraft into Dan- Air's fleet in 1986.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 119, 145/6Market Place – Dan-Air, Air Transport, Flight International, 22 March 1986, p. 9 This in turn necessitated putting in place the maintenance infrastructure to support the operation of the airline's first widebodied type at Gatwick. * Gatwick's increasingly tight slot situation from the second half of the 1980s made frequent ferry flights to/from Lasham and Manchester to maintain Dan-Air's large, Gatwick-based narrow-bodied fleet less and less feasible as each movement accounted for by a non-revenue flight represented a lost commercial opportunity. The opening of Dan-Air Engineering's third maintenance base resulted in an increase in the engineering unit's total staffing level to over 1,600. =Change of ownership= Dan-Air Engineering's sister airline Dan-Air's growing financial problems from the second half of 1990 against the backdrop of a severe recession in the UK and a looming war in the Gulf led to a change in both organisations' parent company Davies and Newman's top management. This in turn resulted in a change in the airline's strategic direction with profound implications for the engineering unit's future. The new management's decision to focus Dan-Air's future activities on the provision of fully fledged scheduled services on high-profile domestic and international European trunk routes from the airline's Gatwick base with a fleet of brand-new Boeing 737 300/400 series and BAe 146 300 series/Avro RJ115British Aerospace – Avro RJ, Commercial Aircraft Directory, Flight International, 25–31 August 1999, p. 49 jets meant that Dan-Air Engineering's capacity exceeded its sister airline's maintenance requirements by 45%. At the same time, Dan-Air Engineering was facing growing competition in the global third-party MRO market from rival specialist providers with far greater economies of scale, considerably lower labour costs and much more powerful parent organisations in places such as China, the Middle East and the Republic of Ireland. As a result, Davies and Newman was no longer in a position to fund the competing investment requirements of both its airline and engineering subsidiaries from its own, limited financial resources. It therefore decided to focus all its resources on Dan-Air and to sell off Dan-Air Engineering to a major, specialist MRO provider with the expertise and resources to continue investing in it.Dan-Air Engineering put up for sale, Operations: Air Transport, Flight International, 26 September-2 October 1990, p. 10 In the event, Davies and Newman sold Dan- Air Engineering to FLS Aerospace, a major specialist MRO provider in the UK and Ireland with bases at Stansted, Manchester and Dublin, for £27.5 million on 28 February 1991.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 148, 183 The sale of Dan-Air Engineering to FLS Aerospace resulted in a reduction in employment at the remaining Davies and Newman group companies from 4,000 to 2,500, almost all of whom continued to be employed at Dan-Air. Following Dan-Air Engineering's sale, Dan-Air awarded FLS Aerospace the contract for the maintenance of its fleet. (FLS Aerospace's loss of the Dan-Air maintenance contract as a result of the airline's takeover by British Airways in 1992 led to the decommissioning and mothballing of the hangars it had acquired from Dan-Air Engineering at Gatwick and Lasham. The Gatwick hangar was subsequently brought back into service in the late-1990s following British Airways's decision to make the airport a major hub. It was decommissioned once more as a consequence of British Airways's subsequent decision to de-hub Gatwick, following the adoption of a new corporate strategy aimed at restructuring the airline's loss-making operation at the airport in the aftermath of recording its first-ever full-year loss since privatisation in 2000. Most recently, on 1 August 2006, Virgin Atlantic took over this hangar to provide an in-house maintenance capability for its growing Boeing 747-400 fleet at Gatwick as well as to support sister airline Virgin Nigeria's daily Airbus A340 operation from/to Lagos at the airport. Meanwhile, FLS Aerospace itself was acquired by SR Technics, the former maintenance arm of defunct Swissair, in 2004. Towards the end of 2006, SR Technics in turn was jointly taken over by the governments of Abu Dhabi and Dubai (through Mubadala and Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, respectively), who then incorporated it into their nascent MRO venture.

He began his career in 1906 as a performer in operettas in New York City, and was also seen during his early career in cabaret, musical theatre, and vaudeville performances. With the aid of Oscar Hammerstein I, he branched out into opera in 1910 as a leading tenor with Hammerstein's opera houses in New York City and Philadelphia. While his career from this point on primarily consisted of opera performances, he periodically returned to operetta and musical theatre throughout his career. He notably created the role of Captain Dick Warrington in the world premiere of Victor Herbert's operetta Naughty Marietta in November 1910. As an opera singer, Harrold specialized in the lyric tenor repertoire of the Italian and French languages. In 1911–1912 he performed with Hammerstein's opera house in London. From 1912–1922 he was one of the leading opera tenors in Chicago; performing with a variety of companies in that city. He spent the last 6 years of his opera career performing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City; giving his last opera performance there in 1924. He continued to perform in vaudeville entertainments up into the late 1920s. He made several gramophone records during his career; including recordings for Edison Records, Columbia Records (1913–1916) and the Victor Talking Machine Company (1920–1924). Early life Born in Cowan, Indiana, Harrold was the son of John William Harrold and his wife Emily Harrold (née Chalfant). His parents were farmers and at the age of 9 he moved with his family to Lyons, Kansas. They moved again to Newton, Kansas when he was 13. In Newton he began taking singing lessons with his school's music supervisor, Mrs. Gaston Boyd, who was a graduate of the New England Conservatory. In Kansas he sang with various community and church choruses and performed in a vocal quartet. He also won a local music competition. In 1893 he performed at the Chicago World's Fair. In 1894 he and his family returned to Cowan, Indiana. He played in a band in Muncie where he also began taking violin lessons and sang in church choirs. In 1898 he married Euphamia Evelyn “Effie” Kiger with whom he had three children. They divorced in 1913.Biography of Orville Harrold His second wife was a fellow singer, Lydia Locke; they married in 1913 and divorced in 1917.\\"Harrold Seeks Divorce\\" New York Times (July 8, 1917): 3. Education and early career After being encouraged to pursue a singing career by Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Harrold moved to New York in 1906 to pursue studies in opera and acting. He made his stage debut in the summer of 1906 in the light operetta The Social Whirl at The Shubert Organization's Casino Theatre. The following year he portrayed Lord Drinkwell in the original production of Julian Edwards and Stanislaus Stange's The Belle of London Town at the Lincoln Square Theatre. In 1908 he performed in the touring vaudeville show Wine, Women, & Song. After appearing in several operetta productions in minor theatres and singing in cabaret performances in New York City for a few years, Harrold finally had a big break in his career when he drew the attention of Oscar Hammerstein I in 1909. Hammerstein \\"discovered\\" the singer while attending an operetta he was in at the Victoria Theater. Hammerstein took the singer in hand and put him under the tutelage of voice teacher Oscar Saenger; paying for the singing lessons himself. Harrold later pursued further studies in Paris in 1912–13. In 1910 Harrold joined the roster of singers at both Hammerstein's Manhattan Opera House and Hammerstein's Philadelphia Opera Company; making his debut with both companies in the Spring of 1910 as Canio in Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci with Mario Sammarco as Tonio and Giuseppe Sturani conducting. He sang in one more role with those companies, a triumphant success as the Duke of Mantua in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto with Giovanni Polese in the title role and Luisa Tetrazzini as Gilda, before they went bankrupt later that year. In November 1910 Harrold returned to performing the operetta repertoire when he starred as Captain Dick Warrington in the first production of Victor Herbert's Naughty Marietta opposite Emma Trentini in the title role at the New York Theater. A success, he stayed with the show for most of 1911 when in toured the United States. He continued to perform in operas as well in 1911-1912 at Hammerstein's London Opera House, portraying Alfredo in Verdi's La Traviata, Arnold Melchtal in Gioachino Rossini's William Tell, the Duke of Mantua, Edgardo in Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Ferrando in Donizetti's La favorite, Jean Grenicheux in Robert Planquette's Les cloches de Corneville, Romeo in Gounod's Roméo et Juliette, and the title role in Charles Gounod's Faust. Singing in Chicago and in other American cities Harrold was one of the leading tenors in the city of Chicago from 1912–1922. He sang with the Chicago Grand Opera Company (1912–1913), the Chicago Opera Association (1916–1919), and the Chicago Civic Opera (1922). He also performed in operas at Ravinia Park during the summer months of 1916–1919 and 1922; portraying the roles of Alfredo, Almaviva in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Canio, Des Grieux in Jules Massenet's Manon (with Marguerite Bériza as the title heroine), Dimitri in Modest Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, Don José in Georges Bizet's Carmen, the Duke of Mantua, Edgardo, Faust, Gerald in Léo Delibes's Lakmé, Lionel in Friedrich von Flotow's Martha, Nemorino in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, Pinkerton in Giacomo Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Rodolfo in Puccini's La bohème, Thaddeus in Michael William Balfe's The Bohemian Girl, Turiddu in Cavalleria Rusticana, Win-San-Lui in Franco Leoni's L’oracolo, and the title roles in The Tales of Hoffmann and L'amico Fritz. In 1913 Harrold sang at the Indianapolis Wagner Festival. He returned to New York City in 1914-1915 to perform with the Century Opera Company; singing the roles of Lionel, Pinkerton, Radames in Verdi's Aida, and Gounod's Romeo. He returned to vaudeville in 1915, performing operetta and opera arias in a variety show at the Palace Theatre in New York City. He then performed the role of \\"The Hero\\" in the original cast of the musical Hip! Hip! Hooray! at the New York Hippodrome which ran for 425 performances from September 30, 1915 to June 3, 1916. In 1918–1919 he sang with the Society of American Singers in New York City as Canio, Hoffman, Lionel, Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, Pinkerton, Thaddeus, Turridu, and the title roles in Daniel Auber's Fra Diavolo and Reginald De Koven's Robin Hood. In the Spring of 1919 he toured the United States with the Scotti Opera Company, singing Pinkerton, Turiddu, and Win-San-Lui. Later career at the Metropolitan Opera and later life Harrold was one of the leading tenors at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1919 to 1924. He made his debut at the Met as Prince Leopold in Fromental Halévy's La Juive with Enrico Caruso as Eléazar and Rosa Ponselle as Rachel. The following year he created the role of Meïamoun in the world premiere of Henry Kimball Hadley's Cleopatra's Night. He sang in several United States premieres at the Met, including starring turns in Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Die tote Stadt (1921, opposite Maria Jeritza) and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's The Snow Maiden (1922, as the Tsar). He also performed the role of Julien in the Met's first staging of Gustave Charpentier's Louise in January 1921 with Geraldine Farrar in the title role. Some of the other roles he sang at the Met were Almaviva, Dmitri, Don José, Edgardo, Faust, the Italian Singer in Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier, Nicias in Massenet's Thaïs, Pinkerton, Rodolfo, Turiddu, Win- San-Lui, and the title roles in Richard Wagner's Lohengrin and Wagner's Parsifal. Harrold also made several appearances at Carnegie Hall while singing at the Met. In 1922 he sang opposite Madame Charles Cahier in the New York premiere of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde under conductor Artur Bodanzky. After leaving the Met in 1924, he never performed in opera again. He made one last appearance on Broadway in 1925, starring as Peter Novak in the musical Holka Polka at the Lyric Theatre. He continued to perform in vaudeville up into the late 1920s. He died in 1933 in Norwalk, Connecticut. Legacy His son Jack Harrold was a buffo tenor with the New York City Opera.

The magnitude of the capillary force F on the plate is proportional to the wetted perimeter, l=2w+2d, and to the surface tension \\\\gamma of the liquid-air interface. Platinum Wilhelmy plate measuring surface tension. A Wilhelmy plate is a thin plate that is used to measure equilibrium surface or interfacial tension at an air–liquid or liquid–liquid interface. In this method, the plate is oriented perpendicular to the interface, and the force exerted on it is measured. Based on the work of Ludwig Wilhelmy, this method finds wide use in the preparation and monitoring of Langmuir films. Detailed description The Wilhelmy plate consists of a thin plate usually on the order of a few square centimeters in area. The plate is often made from filter paper, glass or platinum which may be roughened to ensure complete wetting. In fact, the results of the experiment do not depend on the material used, as long as the material is wetted by the liquid. The plate is cleaned thoroughly and attached to a balance with a thin metal wire. The force on the plate due to wetting is measured using a tensiometer or microbalance and used to calculate the surface tension (\\\\gamma) using the Wilhelmy equation: :\\\\gamma = \\\\frac{F}{l\\\\cos(\\\\theta)} where l is the wetted perimeter (2w + 2d), w is the plate width, d is the plate thickness, and \\\\theta is the contact angle between the liquid phase and the plate. In practice the contact angle is rarely measured, instead either literature values are used, or complete wetting (\\\\theta=0) is assumed.  Advantages and short brief If complete wetting is assumed (contact angle = 0), no correction factors are required to calculate surface tensions when using the Wilhelmy plate, unlike for a Du Noüy ring. In addition, because the plate is not moved during measurements, the Wilhelmy plate allows accurate determination of surface kinetics on a wide range of timescales, and it displays low operator variance. In a typical plate experiment, the plate is lowered to the surface being analyzed until a meniscus is formed, and then raised so that the bottom edge of the plate lies on the plane of the undisturbed surface. If measuring a buried interface, the second (less dense) phase is then added on top of the undisturbed primary (denser) phase in such a way as to not disturb the meniscus. The force at equilibrium can then be used to determine the absolute surface or interfacial tension. Due to a large wetted area of the plate, the measurement is less susceptible for measurement errors than when using a smaller probe. Also, the method has been described in several international measurement standards.

The name literally means \\"shop stand\\". The stall is set up in the early evening on pedestrian walkways and removed late at night or in the early morning hours. Though the practice of mobile food stands dates back to the 17th century, yatai became popular and widespread in the Meiji period (1868–1912) and were two-wheeled pushcarts constructed of wood. Yatai were popular during and following World War II, but Japanese authorities imposed regulations ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, citing health concerns. Today, they are prevalent in Fukuoka City, Fukuoka, but continue to dwindle. Carts A yatai in Tokyo area during its closed hours Yatai are typically wooden carts on wheels, equipped with kitchen appliances and seating. Handles and seating fold into the cart while it is being transported. A pushcart usually measures 3 by 2.5 meters. Vendors serve a variety of foods, from traditional Japanese cuisine such as ramen, gyoza, and tempura. Beer, sake, and shōchū are usually available. Carts open after sunset and close in the early morning. History Closed yatai in a car park in Fukuoka, Japan Many temporary spring yatai for cherry blossom season, 2019 Yatai selling buckwheat soba date back at least to the 1600s, and major cities such as Tokyo could have thousands. A reference to yatai in the modern sense is found as early as 1710. The word appears in an Edo-period sharebon, a genre of literature revolving around the pleasure quarters. Yatai are descended from food stalls established outside of Buddhist shrines from the 5th to 7th century. Historian Hiroaki Ichikawa has said the origins of contemporary yatai are in the Tokugawa period, during which dignitaries of the court would often travel between the capital and their homes. As these dignitaries traveled, yatai provided a simple food option. Yatai saw a brief resurgence in the 1900s as industrialization contributed to rice shortages, and farmers flocked to the city. Kobayashi Kurasaburo, a leftist intellectual, condemned the rise of yatai carts as a product of industrialization eradicating traditional Japanese food culture. The presence of large industrial workforces in urban centers often corresponded to the presence of yatai, and this included yatai run by foreigners to Japan, particularly from occupied countries, such as Taiwan and Korea. After Japan's surrender in 1945, yatai flourished as Japan rebuilt its economic infrastructure, though many operated illegally or through a black market. Yatai at the time served gyoza, Japanese dumplings, heavily seasoned with garlic, which was thought to increase heartiness. This marked an era of standardization for yatai, as corporations, seeing an economic opportunity, began selling \\"ready-made\\" yatai carts in the 1950s, in exchange for a portion of sales. A yatai selling ramen beside the Naka-gawa (Naka river) in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. As Japan's economy boomed, many of the yatai transformed into storefronts, giving rise, particularly, to several ramen chains, such as Harugiya Ramen in Tokyo and Ide Shoten in Wakayama. However, city officials grew wary of health risks posed by the traveling food stands and, ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, new regulations were created which led to a decline in yatai. In the 1970s, the yatai were often portrayed by media as romantic escapes from the pressures of the business world, profiling salarymen who abandoned business careers to operate pushcarts. Scholars suggest this was the product of limited independent options for Japanese men in the time on account of a widespread salaryman system of lifetime corporate employment. =In Fukuoka Prefecture= The last remaining yatai in Kumamoto Prefecture. Yatai in operation in Fukuoka City The contemporary hub of yatai culture are the Nakasu and Tenjin districts in Fukuoka City of Fukuoka Prefecture. As yatai regulations were implemented at the local level across Japan, Fukuoka's yatai operators created a trade association and were mostly unaffected. The number of yatai has dwindled in most major metropolitan areas, though leveled in the early 21st century in response to Japan's economic stagnation and yatai's relatively low cost. Nonetheless, in Fukuoka prefecture, the number of carts has declined since the 1960s from 450 to just 100 as of December 2018. The process has been accelerated by a 1994 law stating that yatai must be passed to a direct descendant, or closed, upon the retirement of the operator. Fortunately, Fukuoka has relaxed these regulations and recently announced the availability of 14 new licenses as of 2019. = In Kumamoto Prefecture = In Kumamoto Prefecture, just south of Fukuoka, a single yatai remains in Kumamoto City, Wakaki (わかき), which holds the last remaining yatai license in the prefecture. When the owner retires, the yatai culture in Kumamoto will come to an end. The proprietress serves oden and an assortment of drinks. She has regular customers and welcomes foreigners as well. She often jokes that she has the most expensive toilet of any restaurant in Kumamoto since customers use the toilet in the local park, which was built for over ¥10,000,000 (about $90,000 USD). In culture Satomura Kinzo wrote a short story about a yatai operator in 1933 titled \\"Chronicle of Starting a Shina Soba Shop.\\" The story is a leftist look at the struggle of the working class, emphasizing the difficult financial situation of yatai operators at the time. The ornate floats seen in some of the Japanese festivals, such as in the seasonal Takayama Festivals in Gifu Prefecture, are also known as yatai. In contrast to the human-borne floats common to most Japanese festivals, they consist of elaborately-decorated wheeled carts, some of which also contain intricate mechanical puppets which perform during their procession. During the remainder of the year, several of the floats are displayed in the town's festival float museum, known as the Yatai Kaikan (屋台会館).

Trowbridge. Rowland Ebenezer Trowbridge (June 18, 1821 – April 20, 1881) was a farmer and politician from Michigan. A United States Congressman from Michigan's 4th congressional district from 1861–63 and again from 1865–69, he worked on agricultural policy and was Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture during the 40th United States Congress. For most of his life he remained a farmer but resumed a role in federal politics from 1880–81 as Commissioner of Indian Affairs for President Rutherford B. Hayes. Biography =Early life and education= Trowbridge was born in Horseheads, New York to Stephen Van Rensselaer Trowbridge (1794–1859) and Elizabeth Conkling (1797–1873) In the first year of his life, he moved with his parents and siblings in 1821 to Oakland County, Michigan, where his family settled a farm in present-day Troy. He had eleven siblings, including mechanical engineer and general William Petit Trowbridge (1828–1892), and fellow general Luther Stephen Trowbridge (1836–1912). Trowbridge attended Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where befriended future U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes and future Supreme Court Associate Justice Stanley Matthews, and graduated in 1841. Problems with his vision forced him to halt his ambitions for a career in law. =Political career= Returning to farming after graduation, he settled in Thorndale, Michigan in 1848 and began a political career as town supervisor. In 1851 he returned to his parents' county as a farmer and became a member of the Michigan Senate, serving from 1856 to 1860 from Bloomfield, Michigan. He married Mary Ann Satterlee in 1851, with whom he had four children: Susan Elisabeth (1852), Stephen Van Rensselaer (1855), Tillman Conklin (1857), and Samuel Satterlee (1860). They moved to Mary Ann's hometown of Birmingham, Michigan in 1860, trading the Bloomfield farm for a mill there. =Congress= The same year, Trowbridge was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 4th congressional district to the 37th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1861 to March 3, 1863. After redistricting as a result of the 1860 census, Trowbridge ran as a candidate in the newly created 5th congressional district in 1862, losing to Democrat Augustus C. Baldwin. In 1864, Trowbridge defeated Baldwin to be elected to the 39th Congress, and was reelected in 1866 to the 40th Congress, serving from March 4, 1865 to March 3, 1869. He served as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture during the 40th Congress. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re- nomination, and returned to life in farming, purchasing a farm in Lansing in 1873. =Later federal service= Trowbridge's political career briefly resumed in the last few years of his life, when his college friend Rutherford Hayes was elected President of the United States. He served as Commissioner of Indian Affairs under Hayes in 1880 and 1881. =Death=He died in Birmingham, Michigan and is interred there in Greenwood Cemetery.

She was Honorary Aide-de-camp to King George VI from 1949 to 1950. Early years and career Peake spent much of her youth at Haslington Hall, an Elizabethan house near Crewe, bought by her father after the First World War. Her father, Colonel Humphrey Watts, was a prosperous Manchester-based industrialist whose family's wealth derived from S & J Watts, a textile business founded in 1798. Peake was educated at St. Winifred's, Eastbourne, but left before taking her school certificate to go on to a finishing school outside Paris. She met Jock Hanbury, a member of the Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co brewing family (whose hobby was flying), while on a cruise to the West Indies. They were married at St Margaret's, Westminster in 1935 and she was known as Felicity Hanbury; that same year she qualified for her pilot's licence. With war looming, Jock Hanbury joined the auxiliary air force as a fighter pilot, while Felicity, whose lack of solo flying hours prevented her from joining the Air Transport Auxiliary after it was formed in 1940. She volunteered for No. 9 Auxiliary Territorial Service company of the RAF. Called up on 1 September 1939, she became a company assistant (the equivalent of a pilot officer), just a month before her husband was killed when his plane crashed in Surrey during a night-flying exercise. After a short spell as a code and cipher officer, in May 1940 she was posted to Biggin Hill where she was responsible for 250 officers. On 30 August 1940 she had the task of recovering from an attack when a bomb fell off an air raid shelter and 39 people died. Her experience here was used as the basis of Susannah York's character, Maggie Harvey, in the 1969 Battle of Britain film where the character counts the bodies of WAAF members. After the real raid Peake went from door to door in the nearby village to find billets for the aircrew who were now homeless. She was credited with helping to retain the airfield's ability to operate and this contributed to her being appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. In January 1941, Peake joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) recruiting staff at the Air Ministry, later moving to public relations duties, where she was adept at persuading senior RAF officers of the importance of expanding the role of women with more opportunities and greater responsibilities. It was here that she met her second husband, Air Commodore Harald Peake (later Sir Harald Peake), then director of RAF public relations and later chairman of Lloyds Bank and the Steel Company of Wales, whom she married in 1952. During the Berlin Airlift in 1948. She is following The Duchess of Gloucester, Commander in Chief BAFO, Sir Thomas Williams and WRAF Command Staff Officer, Group Officer Conan Doyle as they inspect the WRAF contingent at Gatow. During her time at the Air Ministry, Peake forged lasting friendships with many of the most senior RAF officers – friendships that she used to great effect in retirement when furthering the interests of the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF church of St Clement Danes and the Imperial War Museum. In 1943, she became deputy WAAF administration staff officer at Bomber Command. This was followed by promotion to wing officer (wing commander) and command of the WAAF officers' school at Windermere. In 1944, she was appointed senior WAAF staff officer with responsibility for the welfare of women radar operators, and, in 1945, with the rank of group officer (group captain), she became senior WAAF staff officer to the C-in-C Mediterranean and Middle East Command, in Cairo. She became the Director of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force on 12 October 1946.

She was advanced to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1949. Following her retirement in 1950, Peake joined the board of the Truman, Hanbury and Buxton brewery, a job she described in her memoirs, Pure Chance (1993), as \\"sheer bliss\\": there was no \\"buck passing\\", no red tape, and she could get things done. She and her husband, Harald, bought a farm in Oxfordshire, where they bred pedigree Ayrshires and Jerseys, and a house in the south of France.

Its main role is to develop and deliver strategic transport plans across the North East of Scotland. It is one of seven transport partnerships across Scotland and is based in King Street, Aberdeen.  Regional transport strategy  Nestrans produced a Regional Transport Strategy which was approved by Scottish Ministers in 2008. A Refresh was approved by the Minister for Transport & Veterans in January 2014, providing strategic policies and proposals covering the period to 2035. Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire Councils’ Local Transport Strategies are written by the respective authorities to complement the Regional Transport Strategy. The strategic work carried out by Nestrans includes planning and delivery in partnership, enhancements to the following. = Strategic road network = This includes the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) dualling the A90 road between Balmedie and Tipperty, plans to improve the Haudagain roundabout, Bridge of Dee and Inveramsay Bridge. The organisation also commissioned a \\"Locking in the benefits\\" plan for the City and Shire to ensure that the advantages of the AWPR are maintained in the longer term. = Bus infrastructure = Improvements including new park and ride sites and bus priority measures. Nestrans supported a shuttle bus between Dyce railway station and Aberdeen Airport, which is now operated commercially by Stagecoach Bluebird. Nestrans is a member of the Local Authority Bus Operators Forum which is a key organisation delivering agreed quality standards for bus services in the region = Rail improvements = These include the re-opening of Laurencekirk railway station in May 2009, development of a new station at Kintore scheduled to open in 2020, increasing the number of local trains and working with Transport Scotland to improve and increase rail speeds and the number of trains serving the North East from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness. Nestrans is also involved with the national High Speed Rail proposals, seeking to ensure that the benefits of any such major national investment are also experienced in the north east of Scotland. = Aviation = Nestrans works with operators to encourage the development of Aberdeen Airport and routes from the area to key destinations in the UK and Europe. Nestrans has sought assurances that additional slots released at London Heathrow Airport are retained for domestic flights from peripheral airports such as Aberdeen. = Ports and ferries = Nestrans co-operates with Aberdeen Harbour Board, Peterhead Harbour Board and other port authorities in the region, to encourage haulage of freight by sea where appropriate. The Northern Isles ferry services to Orkney and Shetland operate from Aberdeen and Nestrans liaises with the operator and neighbouring partnerships on matters of mutual interest. = Active travel = Nestrans delivers improvements to the strategic cycle network including supporting cycle networks in Peterhead and Fraserburgh and implementing a new bridge at West Cults on the high quality Deeside Line, and off-road paths from the North and South of the region. Nestrans is a partner in the Health and Transport Action Plan with NHS Grampian and other public bodies. Nestrans supports the walkit.com website http://walkit.com/ for planning walking trips in and around Aberdeen City. = Travel plans = Nestrans assists companies to develop travel plans either as part of the planning process or voluntary to help with specific site problems. It maintains a free on-line travel plan builder Travel Know How and helps to monitor the effectiveness of travel plans. Nestrans is also active in supporting local authorities to develop School Travel Plans. = Getabout = Nestrans is a partner in the multi-agency Getabout partnership http://www.get- about.com/ which promotes sustainable and active travel.

In Ancient Greek armies, the psiloi (Ancient Greek , singular ψιλός, psilos, literally \\"bare, stripped\\"). were the light infantry who usually acted as skirmishers and missile troops, and who were distinguished from the armored hoplitai (heavy infantry) by their light weapons and lack of armor. In Classical Antiquity and Late Antiquity and throughout the existence of the Byzantine empire, the lightest-armed troops, typically equipped with ranged weapons, and which fought irregularly in a loose formation, were deemed 'the psiloi'. Numbered among the psiloi were archers, the toxotai armed with a bow (toxa), and slingers, the (sphendonetai) who hurled stones or metal bullets with slings (sfendonai). Others, the akontistai, used the throwing javelin (akontia).. Some psiloi simply threw stones at the enemy and were referred to as lithoboloi..Thucydides, 6.69 The psiloi were the least prestigious military class deployed by the ancient world. A member of the psiloi was normally a man or boy from the lower ranks of his society, unable to afford the shield and armor of the hoplites, let alone the horse ridden by the socially elite cavalryman, the hippeus (). Another term for a member of the psiloi was gymnetes, () literally: \\"naked\\". . Light infantry might also be called euzonoi (\\"active\\", \\"light armored\\"; a name shared with modern Evzones), though these might be any troops lightly armed, such as hoplitai deployed without their shields, who would not rank as psiloi.. The peltastai (bearers of light shields, targeteers) were an intermediate infantry class, better armored than the psiloi but more lightly equipped than the hoplitai - the heavy infantry armed to fight at close quarters in the phalanx.. Ancient Greece Armoured cavalry against psiloi: Achaemenid dynast of Hellespontine Phrygia attacking a Greek light infantryman, Altıkulaç Sarcophagus, early 4th century BCE. In ancient Greece, the psiloi belonged to the poorest citizen classes; sometimes even unfree conscripts would be employed, such as the Peloponnesian helots. They were armed with a variety of missile weapons and might have a dagger or short sword. The psiloi fought as skirmishers. Their task was to harass the enemy phalanx before the clash, to try to provoke disorder and protect their own lines from enemy skirmishers. They would be sent to occupy imposing terrain around and within the battlefield, as well as to disrupt the enemy in any way during his march, deployment or encampment. Just before the charge of the line, the psiloi would be recalled through the phalanx and deployed behind it or on its wings. They would avoid close combat with more heavily armed opponents unless they had the advantage of especially favorable terrain. Psiloi could be used tactically, to constantly harass an enemy, unable to engage them. A famous engagement of psiloi against hoplitai was in the Battle of Sphacteria,Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 4.32.4–4.36.3. in which the Athenian psiloi helped defeat a force of Spartan hoplitai, with powerful ramifications for the military reputation of the Spartans. Roman Empire Grosphomachoi is the Greek term used by Polybius to describe the Roman Republic's youngest and lowest class of citizen soldiers in the Roman army, the velites. The grosphomachos - the Roman veles - was equipped with javelins Polybius calls grosphoi and which in Latin were termed veruta. These were short, light weapons whose long metal points were designed to bend to prevent re-use by the enemy once thrown. They were deployed as skirmishers in front of the heavier infantry of the legion. Velites were used against the Carthaginians' war elephants in the Punic Wars. Polybius describes the typical veles as having a helmet and parma, a small round shield., Polybius, I.33.9, VI.21.7, VI.22.4. Greek language military treatises of Late Antique and later Byzantine periods of the Roman Empire call all light troops psiloi, regardless of their defensive equipment. They were used as skirmishers, but they were often deployed in regular lines behind or among the heavy infantry ranks, usually equipped with bows.

The Dertigers arose after the Tweede Asem (\\"Second Breath\\") writers of the first decades of the 20th century; the year of 1934 is often selected as the breakthrough date for the Dertigers: W.E.G. Louw's Die ryke dwaas (\\"The Rich Fool\\") appeared in that year. The Dertigers strove to write a more emotionally intense, soul-baring poetry than their predecessors. They eschewed gentlemanliness and bourgeois convention in order to produce a more honest and intimate poetry. A further aim of the Dertigers was the effort to achieve a literary greatness that would make its mark in world literature. In an attempt to express their humanity to the fullest, the poetry of the Dertigers has a confessional quality in which the poet seems to be overheard in the midst of a prayer or confession. The resultant effect of these ambitious goals was a heightened respect for the professionalism of the poet; the choice of the precise word stood as an ever- present poetic goal. Nonetheless, the Dertigers continued to refine their language closer to the spreektaal, the \\"language of the people.\\" While the descriptions of nature that characterized Tweede Asem poets remain, these depictions of the landscape are harnessed to attempts to create mood and atmosphere within the poet's own soul.1 The leading figures of the Dertigers are the brothers N. P. van Wyk Louw and W. E. G. Louw, Uys Krige, and Elisabeth Eybers. Also associated with this movement are C. M van den Heever, and I. D. du Plessis. References 1Lindenberg, E., et al.

Founded in 1963, the middle school for boys in third through eighth grades is the only boys' choir school in the United States of America affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. The Choir School educates and trains the choirboys who sing soprano in the choir of St. Paul's, a choir of boys and men. The choir sings for liturgical services at St. Paul's Church and performs primarily in and around the Boston area. It is located within the Archdiocese of Boston.  Choir  St. Paul's Choir is a traditional church choir of boys and men. The choir is composed of boys in grades 5-8 who attend St. Paul's Choir School, and men who are auditioned from local music schools such as Longy, New England Conservatory, and Boston Conservatory. Boys have been singing at St. Paul's since the church was built in 1923, and the choir has built a reputation for singing church music from Gregorian chant to contemporary works. Chiefly a liturgical choir, the boys have also appeared with numerous orchestras in and around Boston, and the full choir is in frequent demand to sing at concerts, weddings and funerals throughout the year.  History  Founder Theodore Marier in 1965, with Gregorian chant expert Dom Joseph Gajard St. Paul's Choir School was founded in 1963 by Theodore Marier and Monsignor Augustine F. Hickey as the result of the Vatican's 1958 Instruction on Sacred Music and Sacred Liturgy De musica sacra, which declared that every effort should be made that city center churches have their own boys' choir school. St. Paul's Choir School started in September with twenty-five fifth- through eighth-grade students chosen from throughout the Archdiocese of Boston. The school was designed as a four-year course for students of academic ability and musical talent, assigning two periods of each school day to music, as well as additional rehearsals with the men of the choir. The music program included sight reading, appreciation, theory, history, and instrumental studies. Under Marier's direction, the boys sang, initially with members of the Harvard Catholic Club, and later with the Schola Cantorum of St. Paul's, which had been formed years earlier by Marier to sing Gregorian chant at Mass. Harvard students also helped out with the recreation program. During the school's first period, the choir made guest appearances with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Symphony Hall and at Tanglewood, the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Handel and Haydn Society. They additionally performed the Nutcracker Suite annually with the Boston Ballet, directed by Arthur Fiedler. During Marier's tenure, the school was renamed as the Boston Archdiocesan Choir School. After the school's 50th anniversary it returned to its original name. Following Marier's retirement from the Choir School in 1986, John Dunn assumed the position as director of music, having been involved in the church's music program since 1960 when he was a student at Harvard. He combined the roles of director of music of St. Paul Church and headmaster of the school, leading the choir in recordings, concerts, and tours throughout the final years of the twentieth century. Dunn maintained a consistent and increased enrollment at and oversaw the move to a new educational facility in 1991. Towards the end of his tenure in 2007, the school became fully accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. In 2010, after an international search, John Robinson (Church Musician), Assistant Organist at Canterbury Cathedral, was appointed Director of Music. Robinson has worked to raise awareness of the Choir of St. Paul's as a primarily liturgical choir, increasing the number of sung liturgies and enlarging the repertoire of daily Mass music for boys' voices and for boys and men. Additionally, he has overseen the introduction of professional male singers to the Choir of St. Paul's and the implementation of the music theory curriculum by the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. Beginning with the 2012 academic year, the school added a fourth-grade level. It is also a member of the International Boys' Schools Coalition (IBSC). In 2015 the Choir of St. Paul's Church came to national and international recognition after the release of their debut professional recording 'Christmas in Harvard Square'. This universally acclaimed recording sold in large numbers, and brought awareness of the choir to a new level. In September 2017 the choir released their second album, 'Ave Maria in Harvard Square'. John Robinson resigned as the Director of Music after his 9th year of teaching at the school in June 2019 and moved to Blackburn Cathedral in England. His successor is James Kennerley. Student life Students attend the choir school full-time, completing a rigorous academic program in addition to daily rehearsals and singing for the liturgy several times each week. The students are divided into three choirs: the Pre- choristers (boys who are in choral training), the Choristers (fifth to eighth graders who sing with the professional men as The Choir of St. Paul's), and the Chorus (boys whose voices are changing, or who enter as Chorus members, instead of Pre-Choristers). The Choristers sing four weekday masses (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at 12.10 p.m.) each week, Thursday evening vespers, as well as the Sunday 11:00 High Mass with the professional men. The Chorus sing at the First Friday 12.10 Mass each month, and other special events. Each student's tuition is supplemented by a \\"working scholarship,\\" whereby the choristers are expected to sing at weddings, funerals and concerts throughout the school year. All students study mathematics, science, literature, language arts, social studies, geography, religion, music theory, and french. Latin will be reintroduced to the curriculum in 2018-2019. In addition to these academic subjects, all students study the piano, and several also study the organ. Opportunities to perform include regular informal concerts, as well as biannual adjudications. Though the school does not participate in any sports leagues, there is a school basketball team that competes against other Catholic schools in exhibition games. Many students participate in sports outside of school. As of 2017, student enrollment at the school is approximately 45. New students are admitted to the third grade based on the results of a vocal audition, application and interview. Students commute to Harvard Square from various cities and towns throughout the greater Boston area, sometimes traveling more than an hour each way. Most students at the Choir School are Roman Catholic and many have previously attended parochial schools. The choir has traveled over the years to sing in Chicago, Montreal, Washington, DC, and Rome. They have also been to Mexico City as well as a tour of Germany and Austria in February 2020. In 2005, the choir sang in Rome for Masses at St. Peter's Basilica and at the Church of Santa Susanna and again in 2013 before an audience with Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square and a performance in Assisi. The choir has sung at Mass on multiple occasions at the Basilica of the National Shrine in Washington, DC, most recently in January 2020. The choir has also performed at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City in 2012.

In the Vitoria Campaign of the Peninsula War in 1813, Sharpe is framed for murder. He must find a way to clear his name to preserve the fragile alliance between Britain and Spain during the Napoleonic Wars. Plot summary Major Pierre Ducos plans to broker a peace between France and Spain, depriving the British of their allies in the Peninsula and forcing them to withdraw. He forms an alliance with the Spanish priest Father Hacha and his brother, the partisan el Matarife. He then arranges for La Marquesa Helene to write letters to her husband claiming Sharpe tried to rape her. La Marques challenges Sharpe to a duel and Sharpe accepts, but the fight is interrupted by Sharpe's commanding officer Colonel Leroy. That night, La Marques is murdered and Sharpe is accused. He is found guilty by court martial and sentenced to death. However, his friend Michael Hogan arranges for another man to be hanged in his place, sending Sharpe to search for Helene in order to clear his name. Meanwhile, in return for their help in murdering La Marques and gaining the support of the French nobles, Ducos arranges for Helene to be forced into a nunnery, meaning her husband's wealth will go to Hacha and el Matarife. Sharpe tracks her down and frees her, fleeing from Matarife's men. However, he is captured by General Verigny, a French officer and one of Helene's lovers, but refuses to give his parole to not try to escape. He is briefly tortured by Ducos before Verigny intervenes. Helene proposes Sharpe give his parole, then she and Verigny will allow him to escape. Sharpe refuses the dishourable plan, but manages to escape anyway when a powder magazine is ignited. At the Battle of Vitoria, Sharpe's regiment the South Essex are left leaderless when Leroy is killed. Sharpe manages to find his men and assume command, leading them to victory. He and Harper then manage to track down el Matarife, who has captured Helene in the chaos of the French retreat. Sharpe fights el Matarife and forces him to confess to La Marques' murder before killing him. Sharpe and Harper then beat Hacha until he agrees to comply with a cover story clearing Sharpe's name. Television adaptation The novel was adapted as the last episode of the second season of the Sharpe television series, guest starring Alice Krige as La Marquesa, Nickolas Grace as Father Hacha and Matthew Scurfield as El Matarife. It retained the same basic plot as the novel but had a number of differences: It is written as Sharpe's first meeting with La Marquesa (since her earlier appearance, Sharpe's Sword, was not adapted until later), Harper accompanies Sharpe on his mission to find her (effectively taking the place of a partisan boy named Angel from the book), Hogan and Leroy are omitted and replaced with Nairn, Hacha is killed by Ducos for his failure whereas in the book he survives, and El Matarife's death is altered, being shot by Major Mendoza as he prepares to stab Sharpe in the back rather than having his throat slit by Sharpe. It also added an extra scene at the beginning where Ducos outlines his plans to Napoleon (played by Ron Cook). Publication history Sharpe's Honour was the sixth book in the Sharpe series written by Cornwell by order of year of publication. After the addition of many more novels to the successful series it resides about two thirds of the way through the series and Sharpe's military career.

Life She was the daughter of Peter of Aragon, Baron of Entenza (1352–1395), and his wife, Joan of Cabrera. On 17 September 1409, Margaret married Martin of Aragon, a second cousin of her father. The bride was about fourteen years old and the groom fifty-three. Martin had survived all his legitimate children from his first marriage with Maria de Luna and was in need of a legitimate heir of his own. On 31 March 1410, Martin I died after six months of marriage. They had no children. His death led to a two-year interregnum, which was ended by the Pact of Caspe, in which Ferdinand I of Aragon, younger son of his sister Eleanor, was chosen as the next king. Margaret remained a widow for about four years. She married her second husband John of Vilaragut in 1415. In secret, she gave birth to a son in 1416, whose name was Joan Jeroni de Vilaragut (1416–1452).Núria Silleras-Fernández: Widowhood and Deception: Ambiguities of Queenship in Late Medieval Crown of Aragon – 14 August 2011 John died in 1422 and Margaret entered the monastery of Bonrepòs.
