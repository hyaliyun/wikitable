Enrico Alberto d'Albertis (23 March 1846 ‚Äì 3 March 1932) was an Italian navigator, writer, philologist, ethnologist and philanthropist. His cousin Luigi Maria d'Albertis was also an explorer and naturalists. Biography Born at Voltri, now part of Genoa, d'Albertis enlisted in the Royal Italian Navy and took part in the Battle of Lissa (1866). Later he served on the battleships Ancona and Formidabile. Later he moved to the Merchant Navy, and was the commander of Emilia, the lead ship of the first Italian convoy in the Suez Canal. Starting from 1874, he dedicated his life to yachting. After founding the first Italian Yacht Club in 1879, he recreated Christopher Columbus' journey to San Salvador by sailing two cutters, the Violante and the Corsaro, using nautical instruments he had handcrafted, modeled on the ones used by Columbus. In addition, D'Albertis traveled around the world three times, circumnavigated Africa once, and carried out archaeological digs with Arturo Issel. During World War I, he patrolled as a volunteer in Tyrrhenian Sea, receiving the Merit Cross. D'Albertis personally designed the Castello d'Albertis, his residence in Genoa, where he showed his personal collection, including, among the others, weapons from his trips to Malaysia, Australia, Turkey, America and Spain. Some rooms were in typical yachts design. D'Albertis died at Genoa in 1932. His castle and collections were donated to the city of Genoa, who turned them into the Museum of World Cultures.  Sailor and gentleman  The figure of the captain d'Albertis was certainly that of an original person, animated by a taste for challenges, discovery and exploration. In 1872, then at only twenty- six years of age he traveled the distance between his city, Genoa, and Turin using a wooden velocipede with metal wheels. Around the same time, the journey between the Ligurian capital and Nice was covered on foot and in record time. His first trip around the world - which would open a series of memorable circumnavigations especially in the Mediterranean Sea and along the coasts of Europe - did it in 1877. The crossing that would have made him famous in the world of navigators organized it in 1891, the year before the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Cristoforo Colombo; d'Albertis had a specially built yacht - the Corsaro - and with it retraced Columbus's course. In twenty-seven days of navigation, using the same equipment used by his great predecessor, he reached the coasts of San Salvador. The jump from the island of Caribbean to New York, to receive the official greeting of the US authorities, was brief. The journey back to the old continent was not as comfortable for d'Albertis as it had been, after all, the one going, although it happened on one of the four school ships of the Naval Academy of Livorno that were at anchor in the bay of San Lorenzo . The ship on which the captain was staying, in fact, ran into a storm that caused waves ten meters high while he was off the island of Terranova and only after a few days of navigation he managed to get out of the storm. Returning to his city, d'Albertis then began to frequent the group of explorers and naturalists who had gathered around the Marquis Giacomo Doria; for his part he tried to make himself useful to the research by performing analyzes of the seas, fish and plants he came across during his travels. An explorer, but also a scientist at home, he conducted excavation campaigns with Arturo Issel in some of the many caves of which Liguria was and still is scattered. = That taciturn navigator in a seal-skin jacket = A suggestive - and presumably reliable - description of Captain Enrico Alberto d'Albertis, is that provided by the unknown chronicler of Caffaro - one of the most sold Genoese newspapers in Genoa at the end of the nineteenth century - who had the privilege of visiting the Castello d'Albertis residence for the first time, and meeting the explorer. Thus the chronicler - also the author of a vignette depicting the captain - recalls the meeting in the supplement to the Caffaro on 1 May 1892: And he adds: = Tenacior catenis and exotic \\"memorabilia\\" = D'Albertis in his travels collected a very important collection of weapons from Malaysia, Australia, Turkey, Americas and Spain: spears, arrows, crossbows of every kind and size, many costumes and an infinite number of exotic tools, now collected in Museum of World Cultures of Genoa. Also in this case the anonymous chronicler of the Caffaro 'is of help', who recalls that to arouse his curiosity, during a visit to the Castle of Albertis, were in particular a dried siren ' 'and a' 'gong' '(\\"species of\\" tan-tan \\", which when put into practice could, even to say, compete with the bell of the [guard] tower, even after the much-feared recasting ¬ª). ¬´The art beautiful, modern and dazzling - the chronicler adds - is represented [in sculpture] by \\" [Cristoforo] Colombo Giovinetto \\"(see box above) by Giulio Monterverde and archeology from the armor of Fabrizio del Carretto of Ithodio magistro . ¬ª Tenacior catenis is the motto of captain Enrico d'Albertis, who on the summit of Monte Galletto, in just over two years, raised - continues the prose of Caffaro - \\"that team of towers, small towers and loggias, which artistically grouped together make up its medieval castle. The coat of arms of the Albertis is in field blue with chains of silver moving from the corners of the shield, joined in the middle by ring; in the fourth, below, a star of gold with five points; the enterprise bears a leopard nascent. The coat of arms summarizes the tenacity, strength, courage, courage, and wonderfully responds to the character of the knight he shines for \\".

The abbey, built in the late 11th century, was designed as a castle to establish control over the surrounding town. It was constructed with fortifications, prison cells, a watchtower, apartments and a chapel dedicated to St. Thomas. The castle was damaged by an earthquake in 1349 and was abandoned. It was looted and further damaged by townsfolk and was left uninhabited for many years thereafter. In 1476, the castle was restored by cardinal Rodrigo Borgia who expanded the fortifications to defend the oldest part of the building. According to some historians, Cesare Borgia and Lucrezia Borgia were both born in the castle to Rodrigo's mistress Vannozza dei Cattanei. The castle was eventually purchased by the Colonna family. In 1778, by order of Pope Pius VI, the architect Pietro Camporese further restored the castle, removing medieval elements like the prison cells and fortifications, and installing more modern features like a large clock. Subsequent popes used the castle as accommodation away from Rome. Features The complex includes three distinct buildings, each designed in a different architectural style.

In the context of control theory, intermittent control provides a spectrum of possibilities between the two extremes of continuous-time and discrete-time control: the control signal consists of a sequence of (continuous-time) parameterised trajectories whose parameters are adjusted intermittently. It is different from discrete-time control in that the control is not constant between samples; it is different from continuous-time control in that the trajectories are reset intermittently. As a class of control theory, intermittent predictive control is more general than continuous control and provides a new paradigm incorporating continuous predictive and optimal control with intermittent, open loop (ballistic) control. There are at least three areas where intermittent control is relevant. Firstly, continuous-time model-based predictive control where the intermittency is associated with on- line optimisation. Secondly, event-driven control systems where the intersample interval is time varying and determined by the event times. Thirdly, explanation of physiological control systems which, in some cases, have an intermittent character. This intermittency may be due to the ‚Äúcomputation‚Äù in the central nervous system. Conventional sampled-data control uses a zero-order hold, which produces a piecewise-constant control signal and can be used to give a sampled-data implementation which approximates previously-designed continuous-time controller. In contrast to conventional sampled data control, intermittent control explicitly embeds the underlying continuous-time closed-loop system in a system-matched hold which generates an open-loop intersample control trajectory based on the underlying continuous- time closed-loop control system.  History  Intermittent control initially evolved separately in the engineering and physiological literature. = Physiological literature = The concept of intermittent control appeared in a posthumous paperKenneth J Craik. \\"Theory of human operators in control systems: Part 1, the operator as an engineering system\\". British Journal of Psychology, 38:56‚Äì61, 1947. by Kenneth Craik which states ‚ÄúThe human operator behaves basically as an intermittent correction servo‚Äù. A colleague of Kenneth Craik, Margaret Vince, related the concept of intermittency to the Psychological refractory periodM.A. Vince. \\"The intermittency of control movements and the psychological refractory period\\". British Journal of Psychology, 38:149‚Äì157, 1948. and provided experimental verification of intermittency. Fernando Navas and James StarkFernando Navas and Lawrence Stark. \\"Sampling or Intermittency in Hand Control System Dynamics\\". Biophys. J., 8(2):252‚Äì302, 1968. showed experimentally that human hand movements were synchronised to input signals rather than to an internal clock: in other words the hand control system is event-driven not clock-driven. The first detailed mathematical model of intermittency was presented by Peter Neilson, Megan Neilson, and Nicholas O‚ÄôDwyer.P.D. Neilson, M.D. Neilson, and N.J. O‚ÄôDwyer. \\"Internal models and intermittency: A theoretical account of human tracking behaviour.\\" Biological Cybernetics, 58:101‚Äì112, 1988.

The Act replaced the Indian Passport Ordinance 1967 and was enacted by Act 15 of 1967 with retrospective effect from 5 May 1967. The act describes the procedures in getting an Indian passport, which replaced the British Indian passport and The Passport Act of 1920. In conformity with Article 9 of the Indian Constitution, the Act does not allow dual citizenship. Under Section 12 of the Act, a person must surrender his passport if he has acquired the citizenship of a foreign country.  Background  In Satwant Singh Sawnhey v. D. Ramarathnam, Asst. Passport Officer, the Supreme Court has held that a right to travel is a Fundamental right under Article 21 of Indian Constitution and the government has no right to refuse a passport to a person who has applied for the same. It thus became necessary to regulate the issuance of passport and travel documents by law. Prior to the act, the government had issued passports in exercise of its executive power on foreign relations. As, the Parliament was not in session at that time, the President of India promulgated an ordinance namely \\"The Indian Passport Ordinance, 1967 (4 of 1967)\\". The aforesaid act was passed to replace the ordinance.  Classes of passports and travel documents  Indian passport cover The following classes of passports are issued under this act * ordinary passport; * official passport; * diplomatic passport. The following classes of travel documents may be issued under this act * emergency certificate authorising a person to enter India; * certificate of identity for the purpose of establishing the identity of person; * such other certificate or document as may be prescribed.  Impounding of passport  The passport authority may impound or cause to be impounded or revoke a passport or travel document:-- *if the passport authority is satisfied that the holder of the passport or travel document is in wrongful possession thereof; *if the passport or travel document was obtained by the suppression of material information or on the basis of wrong information provided by the holder of the passport or travel document or any other person on his behalf; *if the passport authority deems it necessary so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country, or in the interests of the general public; *if the holder of the passport or travel document has, at any time after the issue of the passport or travel document, been convicted by a court in India for any offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced in respect thereof to imprisonment for not less than two years; *if proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by the holder of the passport or travel document are pending before a criminal court in India; *if any of the conditions of the passport or travel documents is contravened; *if it is brought to the notice of the passport authority that a warrant or summons for the appearance, or a warrant for the arrest, of the holder of the passport or travel document has been issued by a court under any law for the time being in force or if an order prohibiting the departure from India of the holder of the passport or other travel document has been made by any such court and the passport authority is satisfied that a warrant or summons has been so issued or an order has been so made; *A court convicting the holder of a passport or travel document of any offence under this Act or the rules made thereunder may also revoke the passport or travel document.  Restriction on granting passport  The passport authority or central shall refuse to issue passport on any one or more of the following grounds, and no other ground *that the applicant may, or is likely to, engage in such country in activities prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India: *that the presence of the applicant in such country may, or is likely to, be detrimental to the security of India; *that the presence of the applicant in such country may, or is likely to, prejudice the friendly relations of India with that or any other country; *that in the opinion of the Central Government the presence of the applicant in such country is not in the public interest; *that the applicant is not a citizen of India; * that the applicant has, at any time during the period of five years immediately preceding the date of his application, been convicted by a court in India for any offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced in respect thereof to imprisonment for not less than two years; *that proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by the applicant are pending before a criminal court in India; *that a warrant or summons for the appearance, or a warrant for the arrest, of the applicant has been issued by a court under any law for the time being in force or that an order prohibiting the departure from India of the applicant has been made by any such court; *that the applicant has been repatriated and has not reimbursed the expenditure incurred in connection with such repatriation.

Special Tactics Officers deploy as team leaders or mission commanders in combat, seizing and controlling airstrips, combat search and rescue, guiding airstrikes and fire support using air assets for special operations and tactical weather observations and forecasting. Special Tactics Officers are not Pararescuemen, Combat Controllers, or Special Reconnaissance, but they lead the Special Tactics Squadrons and Groups and thoroughly understand how to conduct, manage, and provide these special operations missions to both conventional and joint special operations missions needed within Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Training Special Tactics Officers lead U.S. Air Force Pararescuemen, U.S. Air Force Combat Controllers and U.S. Air Force Special Reconnaissance. They do not have their own training course, instead they go through the Combat Control training while Combat Rescue Officers attend Pararescue training. Many attain qualifications as Joint terminal attack controllers. Their 35-week initial training and unique mission skills earn them the right to wear the scarlet beret akin to Combat Controllers. From that point they attend a 12-15 month advanced skill training course. =Initial Training= *Combat Control Selection Course, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas (2 weeks) This selection course focuses on sports physiology, nutrition, basic exercises, combat control history and fundamentals. *Combat Control Operator Course, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi (15.5 weeks) This course teaches aircraft recognition and performance, air navigation aids, weather, airport traffic control, flight assistance service, communication procedures, conventional approach control, radar procedures and air traffic rules. All air traffic controllers in the Air Force attend this course. *Air Force Basic Survival School, Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington (3 weeks) This course teaches techniques for survival in remote areas. Instruction includes principles, procedures, equipment and techniques that enable individuals to survive, regardless of climatic conditions or unfriendly environments, and return home. *Army Airborne School, Fort Benning, Georgia (3 weeks) Trainees learn the basic parachuting skills required to infiltrate an objective area by static line airdrop. *Combat Control School, Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina (13 weeks) This course provides final Combat Controller qualifications. Training includes physical training, small unit tactics, land navigation, communications, assault zones, demolitions, fire support and field operations including parachuting. Graduates of the course are awarded the 3-skill level (Apprentice), scarlet beret and CCT flash. The Combat Control School Heritage Foundation (CCSHF) funding drive supports education and training at the Combat Control School. =Advanced Training= *Special Tactics Advanced Skills Training, Hurlburt Field, Florida (12 to 15 months) Advanced Skills Training is a program for newly assigned Air Force Special Tactics operators. AST produces mission-ready operators for the Air Force, Joint Special Operations Command and United States Special Operations Command. The AST schedule is broken down into four phases: water, ground, employment and full mission profile. The course tests the trainee's personal limits through demanding mental and physical training. Special Tactics Officers also attend the following schools during AST: *Army Military Free Fall Parachutist School, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona (5 weeks) This course instructs free fall parachuting procedures. The course provides wind tunnel training, in-air instruction focusing on student stability, aerial maneuvers, air sense, parachute opening procedures and parachute canopy control. *Air Force Combat Diver School, Navy Diving and Salvage Training Center, Naval Support Activity Panama City, Florida (6 weeks) Trainees become combat divers, learning to use scuba and closed circuit diving equipment to covertly infiltrate denied areas.

Notable Special Tactics Officers Captain Barry Crawford in Afghanistan, 2010. In 2010 Captain Barry Crawford, a Special Tactics Officer, was awarded the Air Force Cross for heroism during a 14-hour battle near Laghman Province, Afghanistan, on May 4, 2010. Captain Crawford was the joint terminal attack controller attached to an Army Special Forces team along with Afghan commandos. The team conducted a night time helicopter assault into a village to gather intelligence. After sunrise they came under attack from enemy combatants and several Afghan soldiers were wounded. After calling for a medical evacuation Captain Crawford exposed himself to enemy gunfire by running out into the open in order to guide the helicopter to the landing zone. While he was guiding the helicopter in, one of his radio antennae was shot off of his back. After the helicopter took off, Captain Crawford and the Special Forces team managed to exfiltrate the area without American casualties. During the battle Captain Crawford coordinated close air support, calling in over 40 airstrikes from 33 different aircraft. The AH-64 helicopters and F-15E fighters which were called in eliminated enemy positions and combatants utilizing strafing runs, along with 500- to 2,000-pound bombs and Hellfire missile strikes. The special operations team suffered two Afghan commando casualties, but more than 80 insurgents were killed during the engagement, including three high-ranking enemy commanders.

He is a cripple who can only laboriously move on his crutches, domineering, cruel, only full of fanatical love for his son, who lives like a monkey in a cage, climbs on trees and eats nuts. His minions are muscle-bound giants and misshapen dwarfs. His cunning secretary only strives to bring wealth into his possession. A dancer he loves leaves him. Then an unemployed inventor demands the hand of his nymphomaniac daughter for an invention with which it is supposed to be able to extract oxygen from the air. With it he wants to blackmail the whole world and become ruler over all countries.https://www.filmportal.de/film/nachtgestalten_19bf37d744d84ea2b8fab6067d2cf6fb The film is of note since it co-starred both Wegener and Veidt in the same movie, both of whom later went on to star in two different film versions of The Student of Prague (1913 and 1926 respectively).Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \\"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\\".

The methodology is structured around a nonlinear phasing process aiming for delivering a systemic understanding of any given urban settlement, formulating the modification set- ups for improving its performance, and examining the modification strategies to transform that system. The basic assumption in IMM is the recognition of the built environment as a Complex Adaptive System. IMM has been developed by IMMdesignlab, a research lab based at Politecnico di Milano at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC). History IMM began in 2010 as an academic research at Politecnico di Milano. That research criticized the analytical approach frequently used to study and evaluate the built environment by most of the sustainable development methods. By Recognizing the built environment as a Complex Adaptive System (CAS), IMM is urged towards a holistic simulation rather than simplifying the complex mechanisms within the cities with reductionism. In 2013, Massimo Tadi established the IMMdesignlab at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC) of the Politecnico di Milano. The purpose of the mentioned laboratory is to develop IMM through research and education. IN 2015, Integrated Modification Methodology for the Sustainable Built Environment has been approved as an academic course in the curriculum of the Architectural Engineering, an International Master Program in Politecnico di Milano. Background At its theoretical background, Integrated Modification Methodology refers to the contemporary urban development as a highly paradoxical context arisen from the social and economic significance of the cities on the one hand and their arguably negative environmental impacts on the other. Asserting the inevitably of urbanization, IMM declares that the only way to overcome that paradox for the cities is to develop in a profound integration with the ecology. According to IMM, the fundamental prerequisite of ecologically sustainable development is to have a comprehensive systemic understanding of the built environment. IMM suggests that the advancement in construction techniques, building materials quality and transportation technologies alone have not solved the complex problems of the urban life simply because such improvements are not necessarily dealing with the systemic integration. The core argument of IMM is that the performance of the city is being chiefly driven by the complex relationships subsystems rather than the independent qualities of the urban elements. Thus, it aims at portraying the systemic structure of the built environment by introducing a logical framework for modeling the linkage between the city's static and dynamic elements.  Methodology  Integrated Modification Methodology is based on an iterative process involving the following four major phases: # Investigation # Formulation # Modification # Retrofitting and Optimization The first phase, Investigation, is a synthesis- based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. It begins with Horizontal Investigation in which the area under study is being dismantled into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. It follows with Vertical Investigation that is a study of integral relationships between the mentioned elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named Key Categories. In a nutshell they are types of emergence that show how elements come to self-organize or to synchronize their states into forming a new level of organization. Hence in IMM, Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy able to add value to the combined organization. Key categories are the products of the synergy between elementary parts, a new organization that emerge not (simply as) an additive result of the proprieties of the elementary parts. IMM declares that the city's functioning manner is chiefly driven from the Key Categories, hence, they have the most fundamental role in understanding the architecture of the city as a Complex Adaptive System. The Investigation phase concludes with the Evaluation step which is basically an examination of the system's performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. The same indicators are later used in the CAS retrofitting process necessary for the final evaluation of the system performance, after the transformation design process occurred. The Formulation phase is a technical assumption of the most critical Key Category and the urban element within the area deduced from the Investigation phase. These critical attributes are being interpreted as the Catalysts of transformation and are to come to the designer's use to set a contextual priority list of Design Ordering Principals. The third phase is the introduction of the modification/design scenarios to the project and advances with examining them by the exact procedure of the Investigation phase in a repetitive manner until the transformed context is predicted to be acceptable in arrangement and evaluation. The fourth phase, Retrofitting and Optimization, is a testing process of the outcomes of the modification phase, then a local optimization by technical strategies (e.g. installing photovoltaic panels, designing green roofs, studying building orientations etc.) is initiated.

Sydney Bourne was a local football enthusiast who joined the board of Crystal Palace at the invitation of Edmund Goodman. Goodman had stumbled upon Bourne's name after searching the records of FA Cup Final ticket sales. Noting that Bourne was a regular purchaser of tickets, he approached Bourne regarding the idea of a new club playing at the cup final venue. The Football League had frowned upon the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also owning a football team, so a separate company was being set up to found the new club, Crystal Palace. Bourne was very agreeable to the idea and joined the board of directors, being elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting. In 1909 Bourne was quoted in the press on the idea circulating at the time of the football players forming a trade union. Bourne wished to place a Director's view of the idea on the public record, and noted: \\"nine out of ... ten clubs ... in England are ... insolvent, and are only kept alive by the personal sacrifices of their directors. If trade unionism is going to step in and interfere in every petty dispute there is not a director who will risk another shilling ... for the sport. (A)ny federation of players must work with their employers, and not against them.\\" Bourne also oversaw the purchase of the land for and the building of the club's stadium, Selhurst Park.

The area covers the Kama, Vyatka and the Ik-Belaya watershed (Perm and Kirov regions, Udmurtia, Tatarstan and Bashkortostan).  Classification  The definition of the Kama culture remains a subject of debate. Initially, it was determined by O.H. Bader on the territory of the Middle Kama, where he distinguished two phases: Borovoye (Borovoy Lake I) and Khutorskoye. A.Kh. Khalikov united the finds with Pitted and Combed Ware of the Lower and Middle Kama into one Volga-Kama culture. I.V. Kalinina, based on the study of ceramics came to the conclusion that there are two distinct cultures: Volga-Kama pitted pottery and Kama combed pottery. A.A. Vibornov identified three stages of development in the Kama culture, and V.P. Denisov and L.A. Nagovitchin joined the Kama Neolithic finds with combed ceramics into a single Khutorskoye culture, synchronous with the Poluden culture in the Ural Mountains. Its comb decorated pottery is similar to that of the Upper Volga culture.–£—Ä–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è. –ù–µ–æ–ª–∏—Ç —É—Ä–∞–ª–∞  Settlements  The rectangular partially sunken dwellings, ranging in size from 6√ó8 to 16√ó5m, are grouped in unfortified permanent and temporary settlements, located on the banks of lakes, floodplains and on river terraces.–£—Ä–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è. –ö–∞–º—Å–∫–∞—è (—Ö—É—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è) –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞  Tools and ceramics  The pottery is thick-walled, egg-shaped, both round- and pointed-bottomed. It is heavily ornamented with comb stamp designs, vertical and horizontal zigzags, sloping rows, braids, triangles, banded comb meshes. The instruments for work include scrapers, sharpeners, knives, leaf-shaped and semi-rhombic arrowheads, chisels and adzes, weights.  Way of life  There are no signs of agriculture. The economy was based on hunting and fishing. Burials are unknown.  Origin and periodization  In its development the Kama culture passed through three stages: early (sites: Mokino, Ust-Bukorok, Ziarat, Ust-Shizhma), middle (sites: Khutorskaya Kryazhskaya, Lebedynska) and late (sites: Lyovshino, Chernashka). The culture was formed in the early Neolithic on a local Mesolithic substrate under the influence of southern steppe populations. In the southern regions the influence of the nearby forest-steppe cultures of the Middle Volga can be observed during the whole period of existence. In the developed Neolithic a population of Trans-Ural origin penetrates in the upper and middle Kama. In this period there are formed local variants: Verkhnekamsk, Ikska-Belsky and Nizhnekamsk. At the end of the Neolithic the lower Kama falls under the influence of the Early Eneolithic Samara culture.

Production was delayed by the unavailability of actress Ramya following her election as a Member of Parliament from Mandya. One of the film's producers, Ashu, approached Jaggesh to sort out the issue and complete the movie. In response, Jaggesh composed a series of tweets directed at Ramya in which he criticized her lack of availability for filming. Production resumed in June 2015 after Ramya arrived and other production issues were resolved.Neer Dose to begin from 4 March  Release and critical reception  Neer Dose was released on September 2, 2016, and entered theatres around the time of the 2016 Ganesha Festival.

Neer Dose received an A certification from the Central Board of Film Certification, citing its many double entendre one- liners. The movie generated mixed reactions from critics. Overall the movie was praised for the screenplay, the cinematography, and the performances of the lead actors. One review said: \\"In a different perspective, Vijaya Prasad has his own profound way of talking about life while staying away from preachy and philosophical touch.\\" Another one quoted: \\"Jaggesh and Dattanna, the two fine actors are yet again at their best performances and a treat while they make it look very natural. Hariprriya as Kumuda is the real change over for the actress, who has pulled it with ace marks. Irrespective of how 'Neer Dose' turns out to be at the end of the day before the box office, Hariprriya's effortless acting will be an everlasting remark in her career.

It is today considered a lost film, and little is known about it.Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \\"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\\". Midnight Marquee Press. p. 213.. It is listed simply as Cagliostro in some film references. Director Schuenzel cast himself in the starring role, and hired Conrad Veidt to merely play a minister in the film, when Veidt was much better suited at the time for the lead. Schuenzel went on to become a noted actor in later years, even appearing in American-made films such as Dreagonwyck and Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious (both 1946).Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \\"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\\".

History The signal box in Bonn-Duisdorf, heritage- listed since 2010. Kuchenheim station, May 2005 Kottenforst station Meckenheim (Bz K√∂ln) station before the raising of the platform Former Rheinbach station building (now privatised) =Opening of the line= The Voreifel Railway was opened on 7 June 1880. The station buildings at Bonn-Duisdorf, Kottenforst, Meckenheim (Bz K√∂ln), Rheinbach, Odendorf and Kuchenheim (spelt Cuchenheim until 1936) were built at this time. The other buildings stations between Duisdorf and Kottenforst were based on designs by Johannes Richter (1842‚Äì1889) and built from clinker brick. The station buildings of Duisdorf, Odendorf and Kuchenheim were built on the same plan. The station buildings of Meckenheim and Rheinbach were built to a slightly modified plan with Meckenheim and Rheinbach built in mirror-image to each other. The line was originally built as a branch line and upgraded in later years as a main line. The maximum development of the line and its stations was achieved in the 1930s and 1940s. The line was then slowly downgraded to its present condition. In the postwar years, the line was called the Kappes-Express (\\"Cabbage Express‚Äù) as it met the fate of many other lines: the second track was removed on more and more sections and passenger numbers declined as the timetable continued to be thinned in line with demand. At the end of the 1970s, the Voreifel Railway was still used by 3,000 passengers each day. Services on the line were threatened with more cuts in the short term and with closure in the medium term. In 1979, the service was temporarily intensified significantly to provide trains every half-hour during the daytime on week days and hourly on weekends. As a result, passenger numbers rose significantly. =Changes to the line= *From 1880: Bonn Hbf (West Rhine Railway) ‚Äì Duisdorf ‚Äì (Meckenheim-)Kottenforst ‚Äì Meckenheim ‚Äì Rheinbach ‚Äì Odendorf ‚Äì Cuchenheim ‚Äì Euskirchen (Eifel Railway) * From September 1881: Bonn Hbf ‚Äì Duisdorf ‚Äì Impekoven (Witterschlick) [km 7.9] ‚Äì Kottenforst ‚Äì Meckenheim ‚Äì Rheinbach ‚Äì Odendorf ‚Äì Cuchenheim ‚Äì Euskirchen * From October 1890: Bonn Hbf ‚Äì Duisdorf ‚Äì Impekoven (Witterschlick) ‚Äì Kottenforst ‚Äì Meckenheim ‚Äì Rheinbach ‚Äì Odendorf ‚Äì Cuchenheim ‚Äì Euskirchen; other trains ran partly over the B√∂rde Railway to D√ºren * From August 1903: Bonn Hbf ‚Äì Bonn-Duisdorf ‚Äì Impekoven [km 7.9] ‚Äì Witterschlick [km 9.8] ‚Äì Kottenforst ‚Äì Meckenheim ‚Äì Rheinbach ‚Äì Odendorf ‚Äì Cuchenheim ‚Äì Euskirchen; other trains ran partly over the B√∂rde Railway to D√ºren *From January 1923 to June 1923: duplication of the line with material from the unfinished Neuss‚ÄìRheinbach‚ÄìDernau railway (the Strategische Bahndamm‚ÄîStrategic Railway Embankment): Bonn Hbf = Bonn-Duisdorf = Impekoven = Witterschlick = Kottenforst = Meckenheim = Rheinbach = Odendorf = Cuchenheim = Euskirchen; other trains ran partly over the B√∂rde Railway to D√ºren *At the end of the 1960s with the beginning of the reduction of the line to single-track Bonn Hbf = Bonn-Duisdorf ‚Äì (Alfter-)Witterschlick ‚Äì (Meckenheim-)Kottenforst = Meckenheim = Rheinbach ‚Äì (Swisttal-)Odendorf ‚Äì (Euskirchen-)Kuchenheim = Euskirchen; other trains ran partly over the B√∂rde Railway to D√ºren and continued to Aachen1962 timetable, 1977/78 timetable *From 1996: Bonn Hbf = Bonn-Duisdorf ‚Äì (Alfter-)Witterschlick ‚Äì (Meckenheim-)Kottenforst (only Sat/Sun) = Meckenheim (Bz K√∂ln)-Industriepark = Meckenheim = Rheinbach ‚Äì (Swisttal-)Odendorf ‚Äì (Euskirchen-)Kuchenheim = Euskirchen; some trains continue over the Erft Valley Railway to Bad M√ºnstereifel.

Explanation: \\\\- single-track section = double track section The names in brackets are municipalities that are not officially included in the name of the station (which is usual practice in Germany). =Development since the rail reform= The city of Bonn in 1994 used the railway reform to improve transport services by funding additional services. From 1994 services ran at 15-minute intervals during the peak between Bonn and Witterschlick; in 1995 this service was extended to Rheinbach. As a result, passenger numbers soared. In 1996, the new Meckenheim Industriepark station opened. The Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg (Rhine-Sieg Transport Association, VRS) in 1996 called for tenders to operate diesel services on the Voreifel Railway, Eifel Railway and the Oberbergische Bahn (Upper Bergian Railway) service from Cologne to Marienheide. Since June 1998, the line has been operated by DB Regio NRW with newly acquired Talent (class 644) diesel multiple units. In addition, the upgrading of the line began. With the exception of Meckenheim station, the line is completely equipped with high platforms. Bonn-Duisdorf station, which was reduced to a single platform in 1993, was rebuilt between 2003 and 2004 as a two-platform station. The signal equipment was renewed and rebuilt with high platforms. In September 2011, an electronic interlocking was completed in Euskirchen. As a result, the seven old signal boxes on the line were closed. Planning Planning is underway on the development of a continuous double track line on the Bonn‚ÄìWitterschlick section and the construction of four new stations: Bonn-Endenich Nord (at km 2.2), Bonn- Helmholtzstra√üe (km 4.4), Alfter-Impekoven (km 7.1, not at site of the former Witterschlick/Impekoven, which was at a peripheral location near federal highway 56, but at the level crossing near Oedekoven) and Rheinbach R√∂merkanal. For operational reasons, the line will be realigned in the area of Bonn freight yard, a turnback track will be built in Rheinbach and the control and signalling technology will be upgraded on the whole section. The work is estimated to cost ‚Ç¨33 million and will be carried out from January 2013 to June 2015. In the summer of 2014, the line will be closed for several weeks. The Witterschlick‚ÄìKottenforst line will not be duplicated because a two-track line cannot be built on a slope that is considered to be geologically unstable. The timetable between Rheinbach and Bonn will be augmented during the peak hour. This makes the duplication necessary. The start of construction was announced by Deutsche Bahn (DB) in 2005. Work has been delayed according to Deutsche Bahn because of proceedings before the Higher Administrative Court (Oberverwaltungsgericht), lack of financial commitments by the state, ongoing construction work on bridges and underpasses as well as planning and technical difficulties in providing alternative routes. Operations Bombardier Talent DMU between Bonn Hbf and Bonn-Duisdorf The Voreifel Railway is served with an hourly Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn service, the S23, which continues on the Erft Valley Railway to Bad M√ºnstereifel as the RB 23 Regionalbahn service *on weekdays services run every 30 minutes during the peak hour and between Bonn and the Rheinbach they operate every 15 minutes in the peak, *on Sundays and holidays services operate hourly.

On a quadrangular base, covered with travertine blocks (opus quadratum), there were in the past two superimposed cylindrical towers, built in opus mixtum and opus reticulatum, the upper one with 13 niches designed to house statues of the dead. The funerary cell covered by a barrel vault is entered via a corridor, currently accessible from the basement of one of the houses that are adjacent to the monument. The cell was coated within by blocks of travertine and included three niches designed to house sarcophagi. The tomb was used in the 11th century and later as a fortress.

It was aired on May 8, 2013. The episode was written by Abraham Higginbotham and it was directed by Gail Mancuso. Julie Bowen submitted this episode for consideration due to her nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Plot Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) encounter Mitch's ex-boyfriend, Teddy (Larry Sullivan), who invites them to a fundraiser at the local roller rink. Cam has no problem hanging out with someone who was dating Mitch before him, but when he learns that Teddy invited the whole family to the fundraiser and sees how friendly they all are with him, he gets upset. Even though Mitch reassures him that nothing is going on between him and Teddy anymore, Cam seems to not calm down. He only calms down when Jay tells him that although Teddy is a really good person and everyone likes him, he did not bring the best out of Mitch, something that Cam does. Jay (Ed O'Neill), knowing that Claire (Julie Bowen) is looking for a job, offers her a position at his company. Claire though, having worked with him in the past and knowing how bad he can be as a boss, tries to avoid him so she will not have to tell him \\"no\\". Finally, not having any other choice, she confronts him and tells him that she can not work for him. While the whole family is skating, Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) sits on the bench because she does not know how to skate. When Phil (Ty Burrell) realizes that, he is willing to give her some skating lessons. Haley (Sarah Hyland) and Alex (Ariel Winter) meet two boys, Max (Zack Roosa) and Blake (Zac Goodspeed), at the roller rink and they flirt with them. However, Alex is not very good at flirting, so Haley tries to give her some tips. Though they succeed in attracting the boys' attention, Alex is confused when Haley turns them down for both of them after the boys remark how \\"un- masculated\\" they feel after losing air hockey to girls. Haley tells Alex that teaching her to flirt was about helping her gain confidence that will attract boys who don't feel threatened when they lose to a girl. Meanwhile, Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) have an essay assignment entitled \\"My Hero\\". They have to write about a member of their family who is a hero for them and why. Both boys are struggling with the subject because, for different reasons, they can not decide whom they should write about. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"My Hero\\" was watched by 9.02 million; down 0.62 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"My Hero\\" received generally positive reviews. Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave an A- grade to the episode saying that when all the characters of the show are gathered together in one place, good things happen. \\"In ‚ÄúMy Hero,‚Äù almost everything MF can do right, it does right. And all this in the third episode from the end of the season, not a big showpiece of a finale or a holiday special. It‚Äôs a reminder of how the right setting and structure can open up possibilities for simple, uncomplicated, well-crafted comedy.\\" Leigh Raines from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4/5 saying that the best episodes are the ones who all the family is together. Zack Dionne from Vulture rated the episode with 5/5. Wyner C from Two Cents TV gave a good review to the episode saying that it was a \\"sweet little episode\\" and that the show is best when the family is together. Michael Adams of 411mania gave the episode 7/10 saying that it was an alright episode, funny but predictable. \\"This episode did give us 2 possible season finale moments in Haley possibly going back to school, and Claire working with and inheriting Jay's company.

Based on the Volvo 200 Series, the 262C was built by Bertone in Turin for the 1977-1981 model years. Concept and design A team of American executives and engineers led by Henry Ford II had visited a Volvo factory in the mid-1970s and had brought Continental Mark IVs to drive. The car generated interest among both the Volvo staff and the people living in the area. Without the facilities to spare on a low volume project, Volvo arranged with Bertone to build the coupe. The drivetrain, suspension, floor pan, and many of the body panels of the 262C were taken directly from the Volvo 260 sedan, with Bertone building the roof pillars, roof pan, windshield surround, cowl, and the upper parts of the doors. The roof of the 262C is about 10 cm lower than that of the 260 sedan. On the occasion of Volvo's 25th anniversary in the United States, Volvo North America charged Newport Conversions of Santa Ana, California, with converting the 262C into a convertible to give as a gift to the company CEO. This version was called the 262C Solaire. Volvo's Swedish headquarters, however, vetoed the project due to safety concerns, and only five cars were built in the end. Rear view of a 1978 262C (pre-facelift) The 262C used the PRV engine, a V6 engine developed jointly by Peugeot, Renault, and Volvo. The engine used a Lambda- sond oxygen sensor system; this was the first use of this system on a production V engine. Standard equipment included power windows and mirrors, central locking, full leather interior, cruise control, air conditioning, heated front seats, alloy wheels and electrically powered radio antenna. The only optional extras were a limited-slip differential, a choice of stereos, and the no-cost option of a Borg-Warner three-speed automatic instead of the four-speed manual with electrically operated overdrive. By 1981, the manual option had been deleted in the US. Reception Aimed mainly at the United States market, the 262C was Volvo's first entry in the luxury car market. About half of the annual production was earmarked for the United States. It competed against the Cadillac Eldorado and the Mercedes-Benz 280CE. 6622 cars were produced from 1978 to 1980. Development Last model year 1981 Volvo 262C (Europe), without the vinyl roof In 1979 the 262C was given a deeper trunk lid, wrap around taillights, and thermostatic heater controls. Manual transmission cars got the shift linkage from the 242GT. In 1980 the engine bore was increased from to , resulting in a displacement increase from to . The engine was also reconfigured, with seven main bearing instead of four and an increase in compression ratio from 8.2:1 to 8.8:1. Also in 1980 the front air dam from the 242GT was added to the 262C. For North America, the 2.8-litre engine produces . In 1981, for the last year of production, the vinyl roof was deleted.

Officially considered a freight station, it is nevertheless served by all passing suburban trains, as well as several long-distance trains.  History  The station has got its name from the Lviv High Castle hill () at the foot of which the station is located. Part of the station is built on top of a former cemetery. The original station building was damaged in the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War of 1918‚Äì1919, and even more so in World War II. The remains of the original building now house the railway offices, whereas the current two-storey passenger hall with the big central avant-corps is a post- WWII reconstruction based on the original designs. A memorial plaque on the station building commemorates the bodies of 602 victims of Soviet famine of 1946‚Äì47 which were discovered near the station during reconstruction works in the 2000s.  Operations  Between 1 December 2009 and 15 June 2010, Pidzamche railway station was one of the two termini of Lviv City Railbus, which was then discontinued for unprofitability. Until 2016, none of the passing long-distance trains served the station.

She founded the Risbergska skolan (Risberg School) in √ñrebro, and served as its principal in 1863-1878. Emilie Risberg is regarded as an important member of the pioneers of girl's education in the mid 19th century Sweden, who reformed the education of girls by establishing girls' schools which offered proper academic education for females, in contrast to the earlier girl's pensions shallow education. Biography Risberg was the daughter of postmaster Benjamin Risberg and Hedvig Catharina Smedberg. She was educated at home and worked as a governess as an adult. She founded and managed a girls' school in Mariestad in 1842-1850, of which not much is known and which she herself stated was not of high quality, before she moved to √ñrebro. Gunnar Richardson: Emilie C Risberg (Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, 2015-07-09) After acquiring her own house in 1861, she could receive her students in her home, which enabled her to open her school. The school became successful, and she could gradually expand it by employing more teachers and accept more students and expand the school to more and more classes and levels without putting herself in debt. In 1863, she had 50 students and 12 teachers, of which six were male and six female. In 1874, after the universities was open to women and the government started to support the girl's schools with high enough standard to prepare its students for university, her school were among the schools given governmental support. She retired in 1878, and spent her retirement in her private apartment in her school building. Risberg's school was upon its foundation in 1863 regarded as an important innovation: there were numerous girls' schools in Sweden, but the great majority of them were very short-term and offered a very shallow education. In the first half of the 19th century, there were a debate in Sweden about offering serious education to girls, and a new sort of girls' schools was founded which offered serious education. Emilie Risberg and her school, along with Cecilia Fryxell and Karin √Öhlin, belonged to the pioneers of this reform in girls education in Sweden. Emilie Risberg was also a writer, and her novels were quite popular, especially Rolf och Alfhild (1860) and Warnhems ros (1861).

It is the only single-engined very light jet currently being developed by a non-American aircraft manufacturer. The programme was publicly unveiled at the 2013 Paris Air Show, and has been promoted to private owner- operators and corporate customers, as well as commercial operators. Originally intended to perform its maiden flight as early as 2013, the prototype first flew on 5 April 2019. Development =Origins= The Flaris LAR01 project was started by Sylwia and Rafa≈Ç ≈Åadzi≈Ñscy with the assistance of the Instytut Lotnictwa, Instytut Techniczny Wojsk Lotniczych, Politechnika Warszawska, Politechnika Wroc≈Çawska and Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna. According to ≈Åadzi≈Ñski, the aircraft had emerged from an ambition to produce an affordable aircraft that would be well-suited to short-haul point-to-point routes and operated by a variety of commercial, corporate, and private owners that sought to progress from operating piston engine and turboprop-powered aircraft. Rafa≈Ç ≈Åadzi≈Ñski, who had co-originated the aircraft's design with Sylwia ≈Åadzi≈Ñski, serves as the head of the FLARIS project and the chief of Research and Development. The chief designer is Andrzej Frydrychewicz. Significant work on the aircraft's aerodynamics was performed by Krzysztof Kubry≈Ñski.

Among the attributes of the aircraft emphasised during its initial announcement were its unique and previously-unserved role in the general aviation market, ease of flight, lightweight construction, low operational cost, safety, and versatility.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"PARIS: Metal Metal Master plans family of Flaris LAR business jets.\\" Flight International, 15 June 2015. The company has forecast a demand for the type of hundreds of aircraft per year. During the 2013 event, at which a prototype of the aircraft was displayed, it was announced that the LAR01 would be the first of three aircraft that manufacturer planned to launch; while few details were stated, it was said that of the two future aircraft, one would be smaller than the LAR01 while the other would be larger. In June 2015, at which point the subject of future family members was discussed in greater detail by the manufacturer, it was revealed that there were future ambitions for a series of business jets to be produced, and that the next design following on from the LAR01 was to adopt a twin-engine configuration. =Prototypes= During the 2013 reveal at the Paris airshow, it was stated that an initial prototype of the aircraft would fly later that same year, as well as speculation on the delivery of a batch of 20 aircraft during 2014. During March 2014, the non-flying first prototype was being used for non-destructive load testing, while the second prototype was announced as being intended to perform the type's maiden flight later that year; however, it was acknowledged at the time that there was a lack of certainty over exact dates. The order book is intended to be opened shortly after the maiden flight taking place. By May 2014, the company was already in the process of establishing an assembly line for the type, as well as beginning the construction of the third and fourth prototypes. The second prototype was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PW610, although alternative powerplants were already under consideration to power subsequent production aircraft.

In February 2017, it was reported that the LAR01 has entered the final stage of ground testing and would perform its first flight within the first half of the year. According to the company, it has been working closely with the Polish civil aviation authority on tests of the onboard systems, including the final tests of the aircraft's detachable wing and cabin pressurisation system.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Metal Master readies LAR-1 personal jet for second-quarter first flight.\\" Flight International, 13 February 2017. In June 2018, ground testing was completed before a maiden flight that was anticipated at that time for July 2018. The first 50‚Äì100 hours of flight testing was forecast to be carried out at the Zielona G√≥ra Airport in western Poland before a transfer to Copernicus Airport Wroc≈Çaw. At that time the company anticipated that the Polish Civil Aviation Authority S-1 experimental certification would be granted after 150 hours of flight testing, all completed within 12 months, before 10 local deliveries, and before full EASA CS-23 type certification, which would follow within 18 and 24 months. Customer orders were expected to be accepted starting in 2019. The aircraft is intended to be exhibited in May 2019 at EBACE in Geneva and in July 2019 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh. In September 2018 the first flight had still not occurred and the company website stated, \\"The maiden flight depends on many factors, such as the weather, and it is difficult to set the exact date. We plan to hold a public demonstration flight only after completing the first test flights.\\" The prototype, registered SP-YLE, first flew on 5 April 2019 from Zielona Gora Babimost Airport.FLARIS LAR1 took off! By February 2020, the initial prototype had logged 60 hours ands the production-conforming test aircraft was prepared for a maiden flight in early April. The company had received 50 orders, mostly from owner-flyers. Polish S-1 experimental certification was expected in the fourth quarter, after 200 hours of flight testing, with delivery of the first aircraft forecast for 2021, before applying for EASA CS-23 certification sometime after that. The flight testing program was planned to include system tests on the Williams FJ33 engine, the retractable landing gear, hydraulics, the Garmin G600TXi flightdeck, autopilot and autothrottle. The prototype reached 25,000 ft in under three minutes and 30 seconds, and demonstrated a stall speed of 58 knots (107 km/h). Design The Flaris LAR01 is a Polish five-seat very light jet, intended for general aviation use. It is made largely of carbon fiber reinforced polymers and powered by a single turbojet engine ‚Äì the production version of the LAR01 is to be powered by a single Williams FJ33-5A engine.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Poland's Metal Master selects Williams FJ33 to power Flaris LAR-1 personal jet.\\" Flight International, 9 June 2015. The LAR01 is intended to be affordable and accessible to individual private owners. Proposed uses for it include air taxi operations, personal transport, emergency medical services and aerial surveillance, as well as its potential modification into an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The LAR01 has been optimised for use by private pilots. Where possible, the cockpit is deliberately designed to mimic that of a traditional car.Jackson, Paul. \\"Personal Jets About To Enter The Marketplace.\\" Aviation Week, 2 November 2016. The designers intend to provide removable elliptical wings for the aircraft; this measure is to enable the type to be readily parked within typical garages; sections of the tailplane can be similarly detached for the same purpose. Fuel is housed within a tank mounted on the fuselage, deliberately avoiding the use of the wings for fuel storage. The LAR01 is also reported as being relatively easy to control. Various features for safety and convenience are to be incorporated into the LAR01's design. Unlike many jet- powered aircraft, it is claimed to be readily capable of being operable from unpaved runways and grass strips. For safety purposes, the LAR01 has been designed to use a ballistic rescue parachute system, one parachute being installed within the tail and the other within the nose, which is intended to assist in the safe recovery of the aircraft.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Metal Master prepares Flaris LAR-1 jet for year-end first flight.\\" Flight International, 1 December 2014.

He came from a wealthy family of Bordeaux shipowners. After serving as an artillery captain in World War I, he became the head of various transport and trading businesses. He is known for having undertaken the first crossing of the Sahara by automobile in 1924. Early years Gaston Gradis was born in Paris on 7 May 1889, from an old family of Bordeaux shipowners. His family, which was Jewish, had been granted the right to obtain property in the colonies by Louis XVI. His parents were Raoul Gradis (1861‚Äì1943) and Suzanne Fould. His grandfather, Henri Gradis (1823‚Äì1905) was a grandson of Laure Sarah Rodrigues-Henriques. He was a nephew of Georges Schwob d'H√©ricourt (1864‚Äì1942) and cousin of Germaine de Rothschild (1884‚Äì975), wife of √âdouard Alphonse James de Rothschild (1868‚Äì1949). Gradis joined the √âcole Polytechnique in 1910. In 1911 he volunteered for the army, joining the Artillery school in the same year. During World War I (1914‚Äì1918) he was made a lieutenant in 1914 and an artillery captain in 1917. For his actions in the war he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour and received the Croix de guerre and five citations. Gradis became president of Nieuport, the Compagnie g√©n√©rale transsaharienne and the Brasseries du Maroc. He was a director of Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise pour le Commerce avec l'Outre-mer, of Maurel & Prom and other companies. In 1918 Gradis married Georgette Deutsch de la Meurthe. Her father, Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe, was the first oil refiner in France first at Nantes and then at Saint-Loub√®s, with P√©trole Jupiter. Their son, Henri Gradis (born 1920), a corporate director, married Bernadette Servan-Schreiber, sister of Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber. His second wife was the daughter of General Jean-L√©onard Koechlin. Sahara crossing Nieuport-Delage aircraft. A folding-wing version was taken on the first exploratory journey. Gradis directed the first expedition to cross the Sahara from north to south by car. For this purpose, on 23 May 1923 he founded the Compagnie g√©n√©rale transsaharienne (CGT). The retired General Jean Baptiste Eug√®ne Estienne, who had designed and built tanks during the war, was made president of the company. The purpose of the company was to \\"study, establish and exploit land and air communications between the various territories of the African continent, particularly between Algeria and Niger.\\" An exploratory mission was sent under Georges Estienne, son of General Estienne, with his brother Ren√© and lieutenant Hubel, accompanied by four legionnaires and four Citro√´n mechanics. The mission left Adrar on 17 November 1923, reached Tessalit on 30 November, and returned to Adrar on 13 December, having mapped a shorter route than those known before, over excellent terrain. Gao on the Niger River Gaston Gradis headed a second exploratory expedition that left Colomb-B√©char at midnight on 25 January 1924 with three large six-wheel Renault cars with double tires. Gradis was accompanied by the Estienne brothers, M. Schwob, an engineer from Renault, and three mechanics. A rival Citro√´n expedition had left a day before, and the press made great play of the competition, which Gradis thought obscured the important goal of establishing a trans-Saharan route. After reaching Adrar the expedition left for the south in two vehicles, following the tracks of the November reconnaissance expedition, which were still visible. The six-wheel cars proved faster than the Citro√´n caterpillars. This expedition reached Gao, on the Niger River, and returned to B√©char on 1 March 1924. Gradis was optimistic about the potential for aerial travel along this route. The second Gradis expedition left Colomb-B√©char on 15 November 1924 in three six-wheel Renaults. Gradis was accompanied by the journalist Henri de K√©rillis, and Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey was accompanied by commandant Ihler. The Estienne brothers again joined the expedition. The other members were three Renault mechanics and three legionnaires. The expedition reached Sav√© in Dahomey on 3 December 1924 after a journey of . The expedition leaders took the train south, and reached Porto-Novo on the Atlantic on 14 December 1924. They then returned to Europe by boat, while the Estienne brothers raced back from Sav√© to Colomb Bechar in six days, setting a new record for long-distance speed in Africa. Later years In the winter of 1927/1928 the CGT began running a regular service from Colomb-B√©char to Gao using Renault automobiles. The French security forces struggled to provide adequate protection to the Saharan tourists, whose numbers grew when the service was made weekly. Hotels along the route in Reggane, Gao and Niamey were operated by the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique. Timbuktu and Gao received additional funds from the government in recognition of their commercial and tourist potential. Gaston Gradis settled in Rabat, where he established various businesses, including Conserveries Nora in Meknes, growing roses for their oils to be used in perfume, and growing citrus crops for manufacture of soft drinks. He also made wine from his vineyards in the domaine de Margarance in Saint-Louis-de-Montferrand. During World War II (1939‚Äì1945), after the defeat of France in 1940 the Vichy laws on the status of Jews confiscated businesses owned by Jews. Gaston Gradis was one of only three business leaders who were exempted from this law on the basis of exceptional services to the French state, the other two being Raymond Berr and Pierre Lyon. However, Gradis disappeared from view in 1943. He died in Rabat on 15 January 1968, and was buried in the family vault at Lormont.

Its scientific specific name honours the 16th-century Azorean historian Gaspar Frutuoso. History The owl was described from subfossil bones. It is the first extinct owl species to be described from the Azores and only the second (the first being the Madeiran scops owl) from Macaronesia. The describers suggest that the most likely cause of extinction was human settlement in the 15th century, with its associated habitat destruction and the introduction of alien species. Description Compared with the Eurasian scops owl, the wings were smaller (two thirds the size of those of the Eurasian species), the legs longer (by 11.6%), and the pelvis both broader and shorter. It was also generally smaller than the Madeira Scops Owl. The proportions of its limbs and wing loading indicate that it lived mainly on the ground and had only weak powers of flight. The distinctive anatomical features shown by this species has led scientists to conclude that it was an insectivore which probably lived on the forest floor of the laurisilva, where it would have hunted and sheltered. Taxonomy A similar extinct species, the Madeiran scops owl Otus mauli, has deen described from two islands in the Madeira archipelago but the S√£o Miguel scops owl differs from the Madieran species by the smaller size of many of its bones, especially the ulna and tibiotarsus.

He was a longtime employee of Papworth Hospital, a leading British heart and lung hospital. Early life and education Milstein was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1918, the fourth child of Jewish immigrants Hershel and Rebecca Milstein. The family later moved to London, where Milstein's father worked as a tailor. Milstein studied medicine at University College London, graduating in 1942. As a student, he became a socialist and expressed support for the Republican faction during the Spanish Civil War. Second World War Following his graduation from university, Milstein was immediately conscripted into the Royal Army Medical Corps. He rose to the rank of acting Major, and served in a medical role in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany during the Second World War. Surgical career After the war, Milstein trained as a cardiac surgeon at several British hospitals, including the Royal Brompton Hospital and Guy's Hospital. In 1958, he began working as a cardiothoracic surgeon at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire, where he conducted numerous pioneering surgeries, including Britain's first open-heart surgery. In 1969, Milstein and his colleague Roy Calne conducted experiments into heart transplantation, laying the groundwork for Britain's first successful human cardiac transplant, which was conducted at Papworth in 1979 by the South African-born surgeon Terence English. Aside from his surgical work, Milstein was heavily involved in medical academia. He lectured in anatomy at Cambridge University between 1977 and 1984, served as the president of the British Thoracic Society in 1980 and edited the medical journal Thorax between 1978 and 1983.

He wrote extensively about Morocco, and was concerned with the working conditions of workers in the United Kingdom.  Biography  He was born in London, the son of Edward Ebenezer Meakin (1838‚Äì1897), tea planter in India and later a journalist, and his wife, Sarah Ann Budgett (1832‚Äì1906). He was educated at Reigate grammar school. His mother was the daughter of Samuel Budgett (1794‚Äì1851), an English merchant.S. E. Fryer, 'Meakin, James Edward Budgett (1866‚Äì1906)', rev. Mark Pottle, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 5 Jan 2016 In 1884 Meakin's father settled in Tangier, Morocco, and founded the first English newspaper in Morocco, the Times of Morocco. At first the paper was published monthly, and from 1886 on a weekly basis.Budgett Meakin, The Moorish Empire; a Historical Epitome (London: S. Sonnenschein & Company, 1899), p. 534-535. James joined his father in Morocco and started to work on the paper as assistant editor, and from 1888 as the paper's editor.Budgett Meakin, The Moors: A Comprehensive Description (London: S. Sonnenschein & Company, 1902), p. VII. James was fascinated by the people and culture of Morocco and soon after his arrival there he started to write about everything he saw and experienced. He adopted local clothes, gave himself a local name (Tahar bel Mikki) and learned the local customs and language. In 1891, at the age of 25, he published an English-Arabic dictionary ‚Äì An Introduction to the Arabic of Morocco. He returned to England in 1895, but his requests for funding his research were rejected, so he decided to go by himself to Morocco for one year, and then travelled another year in other countries (like Uzbekistan, Iraq Budgett Meakin, \\"Among The Bagdad Jews\\", The Jewish Chronicle. 4 April 1896, 7. and \\"The Jews of Bokhara And Samarkand\\" The Jewish Chronicle. 8 January 1897, 12. and further East ‚Äì to Japan). He returned to England once more in 1897 to write and edit his books. He published three comprehensive books about Morocco, which established his status as the leading authority in this field: The Moorish Empire (1899), The Land of the Moors (1901), The Moors (1902). In 1905 he published his fourth book about Morocco- Life in Morocco, and Glimpses Beyond. This book consisted of articles and other notes that were not published in his previous books. He also wrote the article on Morocco in the eleventh edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. He was awarded the Order of the Medjidie by the Sultan of Turkey for his studies of Islam in 1902 and 1904, according to an obituary of Mr Budgett Meakin published in the \\"Chiswick Gazette\\" on 6 July 1906. In addition to his books and his work at the Times of Morocco, his articles were published in newspapers and journals in England and US, including The Jewish Chronicle,*Budgett Meakin,The Jewries of Morocco.

His books and articles describe the local Moorish society, its habits and customs in great detail. During his stay in Morocco he was involved in the local politics and social life. His articles in the Jewish Chronicle exemplify his concerns regarding Morocco, its future, society and minorities (Jews). In addition, he was involved in establishing the anti-sweat league and dealt with social reforms in England, such as the working class situation, and city slum conditions. In 1903 he investigated the working class conditions in several cities in the US and in 1905 published his book \\"Model Factories and Villages\\".The New York Times. \\"City Dens of Poverty; english observer finds bad conditions in america.\\" New York, April 23, 1903.

They lived in Hampstead, north London. His siblings distinguished themselves in several fields. His sister, Annette Mary Budgett Meakin, was made an honorary member of the Goethe Society of Weimar for her scholarly work on the friendship of Goethe and Schiller, written in three volumes. She and her mother were the first Englishwomen to cross Asia on the Trans-Siberian Railway and her book, \\"The Ribbon of Iron\\" describes this experience. His brother, Harold (1870‚Äì1907) was a physician in the Indian Medical Service and was awarded the Military Order of the Dragon for organising a field hospital at the relief of Peking and the Waziristan Medal at the blockade of Waziristan. His sister Dr. Ethilda Budgett Meakin Herford (1872‚Äì1956), was Medical Superintendent of the Victoria Hospital for Women in Calcutta from 1904 to 1907 before she married and had four children. She later studied psychoanalysis and became Director of the British Hospital for Functional Nervous Disorders in Camden Town. James' youngest brother, Sidney (1874‚Äì1941) was a prisoner of war in World War I and was valuable to his fellow prisoners because of his extensive knowledge of German and his ability to act as an interpreter.

Before becoming a judge he was a member of the Cape Parliament, the Cape Colony's Attorney-General, and a prominent critic of Cecil John Rhodes. His grandson was Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, a prominent opponent of the Third Reich.  Early life  Innes was born in Grahamstown in 1855. His father was James Rose Innes CMG, the Cape Colony's Under-Secretary for Native Affairs, whose own father had emigrated to the Cape from Scotland in 1822 and become its first Superintendent-General of Education. His mother was Mary Anne Fleischer, sister-in-law to Gordon Sprigg and granddaughter to Robert Hart of Glen Avon, the founder of Somerset East, who had landed at the Cape as a member of the British expeditionary force in 1795. Though always sanguine about maintaining imperial ties, Innes was proud of his deep roots at the Cape and considered himself as much a South African as its Dutch-speaking residents: > \\"I should call myself an Afrikaner, were it not for the tendency to confine > that term to those whose ancestors landed here before the British > occupation, and to such newer arrivals as are animated by the 'South African > spirit'. I have neither Voortrekker nor Huguenot blood in my veins, and 'the > South African spirit', as understood by those who extol it, implies a view > on the native question which I cannot share. But I am proud to be a South > African, and I claim to stand on the same national footing as if my > forebears had landed with Van Riebeeck or followed Piet Retief over the > Drakensberg.\\" Innes did not stay long in Grahamstown: in the year after his birth, his father was made a magistrate in Riversdale. And his father's job caused the family to relocate three more times over the next few years: first to Uitenhage, then to Bedford, and from there to Somerset East. Innes consequently attended a variety of schools, all heavily influenced by his grandfather's Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed educational policies. Much of his schooling was received at Bedford under the Reverend Robert Templeton, who drew to his small village school a remarkable cohort: Innes's contemporaries included his lifelong friend and successor as Chief Justice, Sir William Henry Solomon; his brother, Sir Richard; J. W. Leonard, who likewise became Attorney-General; W. P. Schreiner, the future Prime Minister; and William Danckwerts, noted English lawyer and father of Lord Justice of Appeal Sir Harold. In Somerset East Innes attended Gill College. His fondest childhood memories were of his days on the veld and of holiday trips by ox-wagon to East London and to Lynedoch, the Pringle family farm near Bedford. When Innes left school he began working to support himself and his tertiary studies. He worked briefly in a bank and, later, the Native Affairs Department in Cape Town in the government of the Cape's first Prime Minister, John Molteno. Innes passed his BA examinations in 1874, the year after the University of the Cape of Good Hope was founded, and obtained his LLB in 1877. In 1878, Innes was admitted to the Cape bar and began legal practice. His practice and reputation grew steadily. He fondly recalled his time riding circuit, which allowed him to return by ox-wagon to the countryside of his childhood.  Parliamentary career  = Victoria East = In 1884, Innes stood for election for Victoria East, a frontier district around Alice. He won a seat in the Cape House of Assembly, partly thanks to support from the region's Xhosa voters, mobilised by his political ally, John Tengo Jabavu. Innes stood for election on an uncompromisingly liberal Native policy: Newspaper editor and activist John Tengo Jabavu, a vital ally to Innes and many other Cape liberals. > \\"[T]he policy of repression has been tried, and it has failed. What the > country requires is that the existing laws should be fairly and equitably > administered, and that the Natives should cease to be the subjects of rash > experiments in the art of 'vigorous' government.\\" Innes spent his early years in Parliament resisting the forced removals of Xhosas across the Kei River. Together with John X. Merriman and J. W. Sauer he formed part of a trio of powerful liberal MPs who were prominent actors for the rest of the Cape Parliament's history, usually in opposition. = In Rhodes's government = Cecil Rhodes (c. 1900), who \\"infected Cape public life with a harmful virus\\" that shaped Innes's parliamentary career. Innes served as Attorney-General in Cecil Rhodes's government from 1890, but resigned three years later (supported by Merriman and Sauer) in protest. Rhodes's right-hand man James Sivewright had given a lucrative government railway contract to his friend and business associate James Logan without going to tender (or notifying his Cabinet, who found out only when the press scandal broke). Innes refused to work with Sivewright, with the effect that Rhodes had to dissolve his government. In 1894 Rhodes adopted an increasingly caustic attitude to the Boer colonies, becoming, in Innes's words, \\"the high priest of opportunism\\"; he had \\"decided on a more forceful policy, which led him to exchange the constitutionalism of the statesman for the lawlessness of the revolutionary\\". The nadir was Rhodes's involvement in the Jameson Raid, an event which, Innes said, \\"no one ... concerned for the true interests of South Africa can recall without regret\\". The Raid inflamed racial tension between the English and Afrikaners, and President Kruger's suspicions, and thus led to the Second Boer War. Rhodes's attitude after the Raid had not helped. He had gravely betrayed his allies in the Afrikaner Bond; yet, far from showing remorse, he switched allegiances to their enemies, the Progressive Party, emerging more ambitious and jingoistic than ever before. Summing up Rhodes's legacy, Innes said he had \\"infected Cape public life with a harmful virus, and to South Africa he brought not peace but a sword.\\" Early caricature of Innes by William Howard Schr√∂der = In Sprigg's government and the Boer War = Innes detested Rhodes, adamantly refused ever again to work for him, and deplored his co- opting and debasement of the Progressive Party. But he never became as estranged from the Progressives and pro-imperialists as many of his Cape liberal allies like W. P. Schreiner, Merriman, Sauer and James and Percy Molteno. Sir John Gordon Sprigg, four-time Prime Minister, and uncle by marriage to Innes, whom he appointed as his Attorney-General. Innes encouraged the Cape Colony to fund the British navy, and, unlike Merriman and Sauer, refused to support the 1898 vote of no-confidence in Gordon Sprigg's government ‚Äì partly because he had wanted the government's redistribution bill to pass, but also because he felt some loyalty to Sprigg and his supporters, with whom he retained a measure of influence. And Innes never became fully pro-Boer; he was critical of President Kruger's illiberal Uitlander policy and firmly believed, even after the Jameson Raid, that South Africa's best hope was Union within the Empire. When Sprigg was re-elected as Prime Minister in June 1900, succeeding Schreiner, Innes was happy to accept appointment again as Attorney-General, the only non-Progressive in Sprigg's Cabinet. Innes was gravely concerned about British conduct during the War, and, in determined correspondence with Lord Milner, urged more conciliatory tactics and criticised the unnecessary imposition of martial law (writing to Milner: \\"I hate the thing. It is abhorrent to me.\\"). But Innes always empathised with both sides, and forever regarded Milner ‚Äì in the view of many, the period's jingoistic arch-villain ‚Äì with respect and even admiration. Innes's movement away from the mainstream of Cape liberalism and into the Progressive government created some distance between him and his former allies. But he remained a lifelong friend and admirer of, especially, Merriman and Schreiner.  Judicial career  Innes was involved in virtually every significant act in Cape political life during his years as a parliamentarian, and his alliance with Merriman and Sauer was a formidable one. Yet he was not particularly well suited to politics; he was too scrupulous and too measured in his views. He turned down the leadership of the opposition, he said, because his tendency to see both sides of a debate would make him a poor leader. But his skills and reputation as a lawyer had meanwhile grown immensely. He took silk in 1898. As a brilliant lawyer of great integrity, who had won the support of both Afrikaner and English, he was the natural choice for appointment to the bench in the former Boer colonies after the War. He was duly appointed Chief Justice of the Transvaal Colony in 1902 by Lord Milner soon after it came under British control. Innes was sad to leave politics, but never regretted his decision, and described his years on the Transvaal bench as the most rewarding of his professional life. After the Union of South Africa was created in 1910, Innes became a judge of the Appellate Division, and in 1914 was appointed Chief Justice of the Union. Innes's judgments have had a lasting and prodigious impact. Because of his intellectual brilliance and the timing of his tenures ‚Äì immediately before and after union ‚Äì he was able to lay the foundations of the South African common law. He has been praised for defending Roman-Dutch principles against the too-ready invocation of English precedents and ideas. His lucid expositions of legal concepts continue to be regularly cited, a century later, on topics as diverse and fundamental as: the significance of pleadings,Robinson v Randfontein Estates Gold Mining Co Ltd 1925 AD 173. the distinction between appeal and review,Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co v Johannesburg Town Council 1903 TS 111. directors' fiduciary duties,Robinson v Randfontein Estates Gold Mining Co Ltd 1921 AD 168. waiver,Mutual Life Insurance Co of New York v Ingle 1910 TS 540; Laws v Rutherfurd 1924 AD 261. the grounds for judicial review,Shidiack v Union Government (Minister of the Interior) 1912 AD 642. determining insolvency,De Waardt v Andrew & Thienhaus Ltd 1907 TS 727. the fair comment defence in defamation law,Roos v Stent 1909 TS 988. contractual interpretation,Joubert v Enslin 1910 AD 6. contractual terms contrary to public policy,Eastwood v Shepstone 1902 TS 294; Law Union & Rock Insurance Co Ltd v Carmichael's Executor 1917 AD 593. accession of property,MacDonald Ltd v Radin NO and Another 1915 AD 454 and the appealability of court orders.Geldenhuys & Neethling v Beuthin 1918 AD 426. He is also known for his strong liberal convictions and progressivism. Innes retired from the bench in 1927. His stated reasons were his fear that his faculties might be slowly declining ‚Äì though some said he was retiring \\"at the height of his ability and influence\\" ‚Äì and the need, for the sake of his wife's health, to relocate to the coast. But it was suspected he really wanted to give his great lifelong friend and colleague of seventeen years, William Henry Solomon, the opportunity to be Chief Justice. South African Appellate Division in 1923 (from left): Sir John Gilbert Kotz√©, Sir William Henry Solomon, Innes (then Chief Justice), Jacob de Villiers and Sir John Wessels.  The Non-Racial Franchise Association  After his retirement from the bench, Innes was free once again to express his political views, and especially his staunch Cape liberal commitments. In 1929, when Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog was intensifying plans to strip black Africans of their rights, Innes founded the Non-Racial Franchise Association to protect the beleaguered Cape Qualified Franchise and extend it to the rest of the country. At the Association's opening function he said: > \\"In a comparatively short time, we shall have to deal with a great body of > Natives whose education has enabled them to appreciate the value of the > political status denied them, and has stimulated their determination to > obtain it, and they will be embittered by the grievances, economic and > administrative which are bound to accumulate when one section of the people > is deprived of those voting rights which its fellow citizens enjoy. Is it > seriously contemplated, may I ask, to repress these aspirations, to hold > this aggrieved and angry multitude down by force? Because ‚Äì let us make no > mistake - it will come to that in the end. This is not a mere denial of > liberty; it is a case of taking away liberty which has been long enjoyed. > That process, however disguised, is an act of spoliation dependent on force > but force is not solvent of human problems. One would think that in South > Africa there would be no need to press home that truth. And yet we are apt > to forget, in dealing with this problem, that you cannot kill the soul of > the people; and that the spirit of man will not tamely submit to the loss of > rights which materially and spiritually he values. ... South Africa stands > at the parting of the ways. She may take the path of repression, easy at > first with its downward grade, but it leads to the abyss ‚Äì not in our time, > but in the time of our descendants, whose interests it is our sacred duty to > guard.\\" Ultimately, the Association failed in its mission. The government succeeded in stripping black South Africans of the vote, and adopted a policy of apartheid that led to violence, discrimination and repression worse, no doubt, than Innes had foreseen.  Family life  Innes's grandson, Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, before the Volksgerichtshof. The Graf was the son of the only child of Chief Justice Innes and his wife. In 1881 Innes married Jessie Dods Pringle, daughter of noted 1820 settler William Dods Pringle. They had known each other since childhood, when the Inneses had holidayed at the Pringle family farm, Lynedoch, which the pair chose as the site for their wedding. The marriage lasted until Innes's death sixty years later, and was unusually close. Pringle, a nurse by training, became very active in women's politics in both Pretoria and Cape Town; she was a member of the Women's Enfranchisement League and in 1914 was elected chair of the National Council for Women. The couple's only child, Dorothy, married Helmuth Graf (Count) von Moltke (nephew of Generaloberst Helmuth Graf von Moltke, a senior-ranking Prussian military commander, and grandnephew of Generalfeldmarschall Helmuth Graf von Moltke, the famous Prussian military commander during the Franco-Prussian War) and moved to Kreisau (then in German Silesia, now in Poland). Innes frequently visited his daughter there, marveling at the cold weather and the friendly locals. Dorothy's son was Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, a prominent opponent of the Third Reich and leader of the Kreisau Circle. In 1945 he was convicted in Roland Freisler's People's Court of hostility to Nazism. Innes had died in 1942 at the age of 87. He was therefore spared his grandson's execution. But he had never really recovered from the shock of Dorothy's own untimely death in 1935, which did much to hasten his own.

It is nothing but pure revelation revealed by Allah. The Lord of the Mighty Powers has taught him\\". (Quran, 53:2-5) The Quran claims these experiences are signs of the existence of God.\\"He is of most exalted attributes, Lord of the Throne. He sends His Word by His command to whomsoever of His servants He pleases, that He may give warning of the Day of Meeting.\\" Quran, 40:15 All human beings are potentially capable of these experiences. God speaks to man The main theme of this collection is to testify the Quran's claim that God speaks to man. It is explained that God may speak to man in at least three different ways; direct verbal revelation, from behind a veil, and by sending a messenger.\\"And it is not for a man that Allah should speak to him except by direct revelation, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal by His command what He pleases.

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claims that, although every human being has the inbuilt potential to be the recipient of divine revelations, it is the hallmark of a true believer that God may speak to him. Revelation and prophecy It is claimed that God is the possessor of knowledge of the hidden and the unknown, this is the basis of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's claim that divine revelations contain news of the hidden, beyond the reach of human beings. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's dreams and visions, along with his verbal revelational experiences have been put forth as proof of his claims to prophethood.

He is characterized as a seven-year-old boy who is shrewd, smart, adventurous, and part of a gang named Sesinho's Gang. The character was created in 1947, became popular through the 1960s, and recently became known again with the relaunch of the character in 2001. With the success of his magazine, the character was adapted for cartoons and multimedia in the following years.

She is a very intelligent and studious girl, and is an inventor, doing various experiments in her garage. She considers books a better way to learn than searching the internet or using DVDs. * Ruivo: The most distracted and naive member of the gang. Always does things before thinking, often getting into trouble. Ruivo means \\"redhead\\" an allusion to the colour of the character's hair. * Boc√£o: In the first stories he was a rude and coarse bully. Over time he became friends with Sesinho and the others, although he occasionally displays his old habits. His name means \\"big mouth\\" because of his gluttony and laziness. * Luiza: A pretty girl who loves to make art. At first, she was just a friend of Sesinho, but after an appeal from her fans, she began to have a slight crush on him. * David: The aspiring sorcerer of the gang.

Media  = Comics = Cover to Sesinho #01, 2001 The first edition of the Sesinho comic was published in 1947, one year after the creation of SESI. The magazine served as a method to alleviate the sorrow caused earlier in World War II. Shows children's comics of adventure designed by several Brazilian cartoonists. It became quite popular and was sold until 1960, before slowly declining in popularity. In total, there were 154 magazines published. The character was reintroduced in 2001, this time with a redesign and new characters, when SESI once again began publishing the magazine. Unlike the first version that was sold, this version was freely distributed by business schools. It was so successful that it became popular outside the schools as well. SESI also began producing a series of animated shorts to be displayed on educational channels such as Futura and TV Cultura. The modern magazines have an educational focus, with about half of the pages devoted to a story, and the rest to educational games. The adventures in which the characters get involved are always related to social issues (e.g. health, education, child labor). = Animation = With the relaunch of the comic series were made some animated shorts for television. The first new series was launched around 2002‚Äì2003 by Futura. In 2005, they launched another new series, entitled Sesinho: √â Tempo de Aprender (Sesinho: It's Time to Learn), which aired for a few years, the last season being in 2008. In 2009, a new version, entitled Sesinho: Educa√ß√£o, Sa√∫de e Lazer (Sesinho: Education, Health and Recreation) was launched. This series aired on TV Cultura until 2011. The show is no longer being broadcast. By the time the SESI has not shown interest in adapting the stories of the comics or make a larger series.

The college is approved by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) New Delhi and accredited by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). It was featured in the news in January 2017, following the suicide of a student because he was allegedly harassed by the college authorities for purported malpractices during an examination. This incident has sparked a chain reaction in Kerala where hundreds of students have now come out to share the horrific tales of torture and harassment in the state‚Äôs self-financed colleges. Situated in Thiruvilwamala in Thrissur District of Kerala, India, the college is affiliated to All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) New Delhi, and the University of Calicut. They have 12 educational Institutions in Kerala and Tamil Nadu collectively called as Nehru Group of Institutions. NCERC was accredited and awarded with ISO 9001-2008 certification. The college is run by Nehru College of Educational and Charitable Trust, established in the year 1968 and headquartered in Kuniamuthur in Coimbatore District of Tamil Nadu, India.  Unconventional rules  There are penalties for growing beards, failure to wear an ID tag, being late, cutting a cake for celebrations etc. Students who question these policies may be punished by cutting internal marks or not allowing to attend the exams. There is an undeclared ban on girls and boys being together on the campus. Student Suicide Controversy An 18-year old computer science student named Jishnu Pranoy was found hanging in his hostel bathroom on 6, January 2017 due to harassment by the college management allegedly after he was caught cheating in university semester exam. There were torture marks on Jishnu's body and the college authorities also refused to take him to the hospital. The death of the student caused violent protests with many students coming out and sharing the harassment they are facing in this college. It was reportedly revealed there are torture rooms in the college where students are assaulted. Students are also fined for beards longer than 0.02 millimeter. Students are not allowed to have girlfriends or sit on the same bench with girls in the classroom. Even cutting cakes in the classroom for celebrating birthdays is banned in this college. Kerala state Human Rights Commission has sought a report on this matter. Many mainstream media didn't mention the name of the college, and instead resorted to using the term 'popular college'. This caused an intense social media rage against the media and college management for trying to cover-up the issue. The name of the college was finally revealed by the Kairali People TV channel. The hashtag #JusticeForJishnu trended in all social media across Kerala. A Facebook campaign page was also started (called Justice for Jishnu ) where students came together to share several posts about alleged that emotional harassment by the college authorities was an everyday affair. The mystery of Jishnu's unnatural death deepened when the college's statement of 'caught copying' was proved false in all the investigations. The university investigation team assigned by KTU(Kerala Technical University) said they have not received any complaints regarding the copying incident of Jishnu. According to the University rules, the college is required to immediately report any exam malpractice incidents on the same day of the exam. After inspecting the bench on which Jishnu sat on that fateful exam day, the distance and angle towards the other students, A.D.G.P Sudesh Kumar concluded that there is no chance Jishnu could have copied from that seat in the way the college is claiming. Also, all students have testified saying that Jishnu didn't copy. Jishnu's postmortem report shows that there were multiple injuries on his nose, face, lips and neck hinting to physical torture. His classmates had alleged that the Vice-principal and PRO of the college had physically assaulted Jishnu after which he committed suicide. After this incident, students of many other private engineering colleges also started coming out with harassment stories from management. When the protest turned violent, the college management suspended Vice-principal Dr N K Sakthivel, teacher Praveen C P and PRO Sanjith Viswanathan. Kerala chief minister said many organisations had started colleges with an eye on making profit, and that even liquor barons established colleges and auctioned the job opportunities in those institutions. Chief Minister said the government would inquire into the \\"corruption and loot\\" prevalent in the self-financing educational sector. \\"Ever since self-financed colleges came up, many saw the education sector as a business with a potential for huge profits. Earlier the Christian managements stayed away from this trend, but now majority has become part of this,\\" he said referring to Jishnu's death. As of January 2019 the Central Bureau of Investigation was still investigating the case.  Torture rooms  The office room of P.R.O(Public Relations Officer) is known as 'idi muri' (torture room) where students are physically assaulted. The college had appointed 'disciplinary officers' to ensure that the rules imposed by authorities are strictly followed. Those who challenge the stringent rules are summoned to this room where they are threatened and beaten up, alumnus and students of the college claimed.  Masked, male strippers outside woman's hostel  Many other students also reported several other controversial incidents, including the regular appearance of men with masks stripping to full nudity behind the woman's hostel. They also reportedly come near the windows and sexually harass the students. This became a serious news when students released the photo of the naked showman and several students reported to media that the management of the college didn't take any action. Instead the management blamed the students saying they must be the ones who is inviting the showman, while the warden said 'this is anyway something you would have to see after you get married, so what is the problem?'.  Chairman's torture allegations  While the college was caught up in the Jishnu's death case, another student named Shaheer came out stating that the Chairman of the institute, Mr. Krishnadas, punched, thrashed and threatened him. Shaheer was a second year LLB student of Nehru Academy of Law, Lakkidi(JCET campus). He had written complaints to chief minister and calicut university in October 2016 stating the illegal activities happening in the college. He also had written letter to income tax department stating the illegal fine collections happening in the college. The university had asked the college for an explanation in this matter by the end of December, while students were in Christmas vacation. When the college reopened on the morning of 3 January 2017 (three days before Jishnu's death), Shaheer was forcefully taken from his college in an autorickshaw to Pambady Nehru college by a person working for the management. Then he was detained and tortured there till the end of the day. He was then forcefully asked to write a letter saying that he is taking back this complaint and that he don't have any complaint. He was punched and thrashed by Krishnadas in his office. He was also made to write a letter admitting that he was 'caught ragging' although he have never done any such thing. When he refused to sign it, he was beaten up. He ultimately signed it when he came to know that he will not be released unless he sign that paper as he was already detained against his will for over eight hours. He was then forced to write a letter saying that he is being suspended because he was caught 'ragging'. After he signed the paper, Krishnadas abused him by saying \\"If you have any shame, then you should keep your head to a train tomorrow and commit suicide\\". Krishnadas also said \\"you will not study here anymore\\". Shaheer has permanently discontinued his education from this college due to these death threats. Atrocities against Faculty and Students of P K Das Institute of Medical Sciences (PKDIMS), Vaniamkulam, Ottapalam, Kerala The only Medical College under Nehru Group of Institutions (NGI), roughly 15‚Äì 20 km from the Pambady college where Jishnu met his fate, started Student admissions in 2014. And exactly same type of system of systematic harassment of Students and Faculty, by the NGI management, including PRO, Sanjith and Principal of PKDIMS, Gopakumaran Kartha, along with formation of Discipline Officers, is carried on there. So far no physical assault has occurred. But the stakes are high for Medical Students, in terms of money as fees paid and yet to be paid and career-wise. Mentally degrading them and threatening them with different scenarios of spoiling career and life and thereby passing on the torture to the poor parents, creating false stories and incidents to create a terror psychosis in Students minds, ringing bells in hostels for start and end of different activities like academics, food, sports, talking to parents on phone etc. etc. etc. are just some methods employed at PKDIMS. The NGI Chairman is responsible for perpetuation of such Students and Faculty degradation methods, ably assisted by Gopakumaran Kartha. Faculty are treated as dirt. Blogs at ddatta16.blogspot.in have more samples of how the management of NGI and the Principal of PKDIMS have fooled Medical Council of India (MCI), Kerala University of Health Sciences (KUHS) and various Honbl. Courts of law, in starting the Medical College, how Faculty pay and Service conditions are blatantly violated and how the power of money can buy all the way up.  Chairman Krishnadas's Arrests  Nehru college chairman P Krishnadas was arrested on 20 March 2017 on charges of assaulting a student named Shaheer at Nehru academy of Law in JCET campus, Lakkidi. Krishnadas, along with Lakkidi College PRO Valsalakumar, Nehru college legal adviser Suchitra, administration manager Sukumaran and PT teacher Govindankutty, were arrested and taken into custody by a team led by Thrissur Rural SP. According to the complaint filed by Shaheer, Krishnadas had beaten him up for almost eight hours and threatened to trap him in a fake ragging case if he revealed the torture to anyone. This incident had taken place three days before the death of Jishnu Pranoy. The Kerala High Court had already granted anticipatory bail to Krishadas in the suicide death of Jishnu. The Judicial first class magistrate of Wadakkanchery rejected the bail plea of Krishnadas and four others involved. Krishnadas was then shifted to Viyyur central jail. The magistrate upheld the argument of the prosecutor T R Manoj Kumar that granting bail to them will affect the investigation of the case as they were influential people and will be able to influence the witnesses. Krishnadas was again arrested on 4 April for questioning in the Jishnu Pranoy death case, but was left off in the evening as he had anticipatory bail.  Death Threat case  The college attempted to suppress students by trying to suspend students who took leaderships in the protests which happened after jishnu's death. Four students of Nehru college of Pharmacy was suspended on the day their college reopened. Their parents were separately called by the chairman and then they were given death threats by saying \\" if their wards did not withdraw from the strike, the parents will find them either in a hospital or in a mortuary\\". Chairman had earlier denied such an allegation and said that he was not in the college on that day and would initiate legal action against Athul who first came out with such an allegation. But later, news channels had aired visuals claiming that he was at the college on the same day. This caused intense strike in which all students of Nehru college of Pharmacy participated. Ultimately, the principal apologized and cancelled the suspension of these students. Also, he gave a written letter stating that no action will be taken against the protesters.Police registered another case against P Krishnadas(chairman) for this crime.  Police Report on Jishnu Death Case  The police report submitted to Wadakkanchery court on 13 February 2017 by the Special Investigation Team(SIT), under the leadership of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Kiran Narayanan accused five people in the death case of Jishnu Pranoy. It lists P Krishna Das, chairman and managing trustee of the Nehru College of Educational and Charitable Trust as the first accused. The vice principal N.K Sakthivel, assistant professor C.P Praveen, P.R.O Sanjith Viswanathan, and college staff examination cell member Dipin, are the other four accused. The investigation reports says that the accused had prior enmity against Jishnu for having participated in the student's agitation and for posting material against the illegal activities of the college in the social media, as part of the agitation. The chairman Krishnadas then conspired with the other accused to implicate Jishnu in a copying case and had fabricated evidence to support the charges. The report says that the chairman then used vice principal Sakthivel and invigilator C.P Praveen to carry out this crime. The accused C.P praveen came as the invigilator for both the exams written by Jishnu. About thirty minutes before the end of second exam conducted on 6 January, he 'caught' Jishnu of copying as part of the conspiracy plan. The student he accused Jishnu of copying from was also named Jishnu. The exam cell staff Dipin also helped Praveen to implement this plan. It is also alleged that Praveen may have got confused on which Jishnu was the target and hence he caught both of them for copying. Both students were then taken to the Principal's office. The principal who knew about the conspiracy refused to fabricate them for the crime they didn't do. He asked the vice principal and invigilator to let the students go without any consequences. However, Vice principal only let the other Jishnu leave. He then took his target, Jishnu Pranoy to his cabin and crossed out his examination papers. The police report says that he then physically and mentally tortured Jishnu for next two hours. The vice principal is also charged with the crime of physical assault. Then, Jishnu was told that he has been debarred from writing any exams for the next three years. Later, Jishnu was found hanging in the bathroom of boy's hostel. Police report also states there is no evidence of Jishnu copying. Police report further states that the accused chairman Krishna das and P.R.O Sanjith then destroyed evidence by damaging the hard disk which stored the footage of CCTV cameras in the college. They also cleaned the blood stains and other potential evidence. They were also accused of making false documents with fake signature of Jishnu. The charges against the accused have been framed under eight sections of the IPC including Section 306 (abetment of suicide), Section 323 (physical assault and causing injury), Section 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), Section 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and Section 201(destruction of evidence). All the sections are non bailable. When the arrest was imminent, all five accused went into hiding and has been absconding from Police ever since. Police had carried out searches in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The P.K Das hospital owned by the same chairman was also searched. Few days later, the police forensic team found blood stains in Vice principal's cabinet, P.R.O's room and the bathroom where Jishnu was found hanging. Police is also trying to recover the CCTV footage. Police have also made look-out notices in search for the five absconding accused and have alerted all airports.  Land acquisition and illegal use  Nehru college illegally acquired and used the 'forest land' for their own private construction activities. Following this, Thrissur DFO(Deputy Conservator of Forests) had visited the site. DFO said that the forest department will recover this illegally acquired land.

It was opened on 5 April 1910, disrupted by the bombing of the South Bridge on 6 January 1945, reopened with one track on 3 May 1946 and two tracks in 1950 and electrified on 27 May 1962. Operations The line is mainly used by freight trains in order not to have to run through Cologne Hauptbahnhof (main or central station). Along the line, there are no passenger stations. During the development of the Western Ring (Westring) project as part of the Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn (operated as part of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn), consideration is being given to running over the South Bridge. Until the upgrade of the K√∂ln Messe/Deutz station, the bypass line was used by Intercity-Express (ICE) trains from D√ºsseldorf and Wuppertal running towards the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway avoiding, on the one hand, a change of direction in Cologne station and, on the other hand, twice using the chronically overloaded Hohenzollern Bridge, which can only be run over at 30 km/h. Currently, except for occasional ICE and EuroNight services, the rail bypass is only used by passenger trains on an unscheduled basis, for example during disruption or construction on the direct line.

Bor is one of the largest copper reserves in Serbia and in the world, having estimated reserves of 200 million tonnes of ore grading 1.5% copper. The area had been mined for gold as far back as at least the ancient Romans, but copper ore was only discovered, accidentally, in 1902. Local legend holds that a young local man, Paun Me≈ædinoviƒá, was the discover of the first lump of copper ore, but it was industrialist ƒêorƒëe Vajfert who made the first formal exploitations - forming La Compagnie fran√ßaise des mines de Bor, Concession St. George with French financing, in1903. As early as 1904, the mine employed around 80 miners and, during that year, 5,500 tons of copper ore were excavated, resulting in 774 tons of pure copper. In the first five years, the French company capital was increased from the initial 5.5 to 7 million French francs in gold. Copper was transferred to the nearest train station in Vra≈æogrnci by ox-carts until 1911, when they were replaced by the new Bor- Metovnica railway. The expansion of the facilities, particularly the smelter and the froth flotation tanks, brought about environmental pollution from the sulphuric fumes. This had an indirect influence on the increase in the price of food products in the area, as well as protests from the local population involved in agriculture. Following periods of economic lull and boom, the Bor Mines and Smelters public company was founded by Yugoslav government decree by 1945. Digging was undertaken manually due to lack of modernisation funds, but with reports of \\"up to 160%\\" improvements over pre-war output due to \\"great working-class enthusiasm\\" and \\"voluntary extra hours\\". Largely due to the growth of the mine's workforce and associated industry, the town of Bor was given city status in 1947. The Bor Mining and Smelting Combine was formed in 1961 and women were first employed in the organisation at that time.

He was born at Ramsbottom, Lancashire and died at Rochdale. Savage was a right-arm off-break bowler who, unusually for his time, which was an era of increasingly defensive bowling, flighted the ball rather than bowling flat, and a right-handed tail-end batsman. In his first game for Leicestershire in 1953 he hit 31 and 8 not out, and therefore averaged 39.00 with the bat at that point: it proved to be a very false dawn in terms of his batting ability, as he only once surpassed that 31 and his highest score in 17 years was only 33. It was as an off-spin bowler that, having played a few matches over several seasons, he joined the Leicestershire staff in 1957 and was virtually ever-present in the first team for the next 10 seasons, often providing the only spin alternative to a succession of seam bowlers. Within the first month of the 1957 season Savage had achieved what would prove to be his best batting and bowling performances. In his first match of the season, against Yorkshire, he scored 33. And 10 days later he took eight Gloucestershire wickets for 50 runs in the first innings at the Wagon Works Ground, Gloucester. He took 80 wickets at the economical average of 19.46 in 1957, and had a similar return, 93 wickets at 20.08 in 1958. He was awarded his county cap in 1958. Savage took 101 wickets in 1959 and repeated the feat of 100 wickets in a season twice more, in 1961 and 1963. His best figures were 122 wickets at an average of 18.93 in 1961 when he also took a hat-trick of three wickets in three balls in the match against Somerset. At the end of the 1961 season he was picked for the Players team in the Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival and took five wickets in the second innings to win the game. He was, wrote Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \\"one of the best off-spinners in the country\\". At the start of the 1962 season, he was picked for the season opener match between the 1961 county champions, Yorkshire, and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and at the end of the season and in 1964 he appeared in other Scarborough Festival games; these games were his only representative cricket outside county matches, and with off-spinning all- rounders of the calibre of Fred Titmus, David Allen and Ray Illingworth as his contemporaries, he was not close to Test selection. After 1963, Savage's wicket-taking powers declined and he did not achieve 100 wickets in a season again. By 1966, when Leicestershire were enjoying a revival under new captain Tony Lock, he took only 55 wickets in 27 matches. By this time, the county had recruited another off-spinner in Jack Birkenshaw, and Savage was released at the end of the 1966 season. He then joined his native Lancashire for three seasons, playing regularly in the first two, but retiring from first-class cricket at the age of 40 in 1969. He then remained with Lancashire for a further nine years as a coach and as captain of the second eleven.

The British Tunny Club was founded in Scarborough in 1933 and had its headquarters there. The Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus Thynnus) (or \\"tunny\\" as it was known in Britain at the time) is a large and powerful fish, arguably the strongest fish in the world, which is frequently the target of big-game fishermen. Off the Yorkshire coast in that era various records were made (including a world record) for size of tunny caught with rod and line. Tunny was present in the North Sea until the 1950s when commercial herring and mackerel fishing depleted its food supply and it became extirpated. Tunny fishing The tunny is a large and powerful fish, arguably the strongest fish in the world, with a fishing season mostly in August and September in Britain. In the 1930s rods six foot six inches long were used made of hickory, bamboo, lancewood and greenheart. American Ashaway lines of natural fibre were favoured. Mackerel and herring were used for bait on five-inch hooks. Often tunny were to be found near commercial herring drifters tracking the migrating shoals of herring along the coast, or near steam trawlers hauling their catches. Actual angling was done from a small boat, sometimes a coble towed to the fishing grounds behind a large yacht. Scarborough In 1929 the steam drifter Ascendent caught a tunny and a Scarborough showman awarded the crew 50 shillings so he could exhibit it as a tourist attraction. Henry Stapleton-Cotton pioneered sport fishing for tunny in Britain although both the fish he hooked in 1929 escaped. Big-game fishing effectively started in 1930 when Lorenzo \\"Lawrie\\" Mitchell‚ÄìHenry, when fifty miles offshore, landed the first tunny caught on rod and line weighing . After a poor season in 1931, the following year saw Harold Hardy of Cloughton Hall battling with a tunny about 16 feet long for over seven hours before his line snapped. Also on board the trawler Dick Whittington were four visitors who described the struggle as \\"the greatest fight they had ever seen in their lives\\". Mrs Sparrow caught a fish of . Each season up until 1939 saw fish of over being caught and the size of the specimens drew vast crowds. The town of Scarborough was transformed into a resort for the wealthy. A gentlemen's club the British Tunny Club was founded in 1933 and set up its headquarters there. The first president was Colonel (and, later, Sir) Edward Peel. A women's world tuna challenge cup was held at Scarborough for many years. High society Attracted by tales of the huge fish, high society turned its attention to Scarborough where sport was available only a few miles offshore. Special trains were run from London to bring the luminaries. Magazines published many sensational stories covering the personalities and the yachts that sailed to Scarborough. There were Lady Broughton, the African big-game hunter, who slept in a tent on the deck of her yacht; Colonel Sir Edward Peel of the wealthy aristocratic Peel family with his large Sudanese-crewed steam yacht St George; Lord Astor, the newspaper proprietor; Charles Laughton, the actor; Tommy Sopwith, who challenged for the America's Cup in 1934 and 1937; Lord Crathorne, later Chairman of the Conservative Party; and Lord Moyne of the Guinness family, later assassinated in Egypt. Baron Henri de Rothschild sailed in his 1000-ton yacht Eros but he personally chose to fish for dab whilst waiting for his guests to bring in tunny. Lord Egerton succeeded in catching a and a fish together on a single line. Colonel Henn, Chief Constable of Gloucestershire, was towed four miles in his coble by the tunny he caught and Peel had to put about St George to search for him. Lady Yule, widow of Sir David Yule, sailed in her 1574-ton yacht Nahlin with her daughter Gladys, \\"said to be the richest heiress in the Empire\\". The yacht, which is now owned by Sir James Dyson, at the time had twelve bathrooms and a gymnasium. World and British tunny records In 1932 Edward Peel landed a world-record tunny of , capturing the record by from one caught off Nova Scotia by American champion Zane Grey. The British record which still stands is for a fish weighing caught off Scarborough in 1933 by Lorenzo Mitchell-Henry but in 1949 a larger fish weighing was taken on a line by a Lincolnshire farmer Jack Hedley Lewis. An objection from Mitchell-Henry was sustained on grounds that the rope from which the fish was hung was wet and therefore excessively heavy. In 1947 Dr Bidi Evans fishing from her father's yacht caught a tunny with which she still holds the British women's record. The last tunny to be caught was in 1954 since which time none has been caught off the coast of Great Britain. Rise and decline of North Sea tunny The discovery of tunny raised the question as to whether they had been around but undiscovered all the time. Colonel Peel was interested in marine biology and he made his yacht St George available to Frederick Russell for investigating the fishes' movements in the North Sea. Although local fishermen considered there had been no tunny before World War I, these studies suggested that migration into the North Sea had not been recent. There are photographs of Peel and Russell engaged on this study. World War II interrupted fishing and after the war the technical developments in commercial fishing in the North Sea reduced herring and mackerel stocks and led to the disappearance of tunny. In 2000 a 76-year-old pensioner using a fishing rod for the first time landed the largest tuna caught off the British Isles for nearly 50 years. Off the north-west coast of Ireland Alan Glanville caught a fish and next day caught one of .

Three of the rocks are marked by perches to facilitate the approach to Carsaig Quay. The tidal streams along the south coast of Mull are weak westward of Carsaig Bay. Geography and geology The bay is on the south coast of the Ross of Mull and extends from Rubh' a' Chromain in the west to Carraig Mh√≤r in the east. It is accessible from the A849 from Craignure, which leads to an unclassified road east of Bunessan, the last stretch of which is steep and very narrow. The precipitous cliffs on this coast are tallest at Rudha Fhaoilean. where they are high at about inland. The coast from Rudha Fhaoilean to Rudha Dubh, the western point of the entrance to Loch Buie, a distance of to the east, is steep except where the bay is formed. This area affords some shelter by Gamhnach Mh√≤r. The cliffs are lined with basaltic columns, some of them attaining a diameter of . The Carsaig Arches, a natural formation situated at Malcolm's Point, are located west of the bay. One of the well known caves here is known as the Nuns Cave where nuns from the Iona Abbey used to escape from the rigours of reformation and hide here. The use of some of these caves reportedly dates back to the 6th century. It is also reported that during the 15th century, the monks (1500 of them) of the Iona Abbey used to visit the shores and caves here to collect sea washed stones and carve them into artifacts and grave stones. Erosive action of the hills has created an amphitheater in basaltic formations rising to a height of ( is also mentioned). At the termination of the track the huge columnar basalts rise to a height of . Other formations seen are weathered sills and dykes. Fossils are a frequent find here. The site has sedimentary rocks of Palaeocene age. Cretaceous strata recorded here has geological formations of sandstones and mudstones with several chalk clasts. The sill formation noted here is the Rubh' a'Chromain which is formed of felsite, basalt and xenoliths. Flora and fauna The flora, a distinct feature on the road to the bay, is of wild strawberry and scented woodbine. The fauna noted during the low tide in the bay are oystercatcher and terns Other fauna reported are wild goats, golden eagles and sea eagles and also kittiwakes and fulmars which breed here.

In the Preface to her sister's last work expressly intended for publication during her lifetime, Paul Howard's Captivity and Why He Escaped (1876), Augusta included the following note, \\"Since these pages were written, but before they could go to press, the kind hand that penned them ‚Äì the active brain of one who loved and sought to benefit by tender truths all little children ‚Äì lay at rest. Emilia Marryat Norris died suddenly on the 20th of last April; and all of you boys and girls who read this her last work ‚Äì you in whose joys and sorrows she so greatly sympathized ‚Äì must receive it now as you would a legacy from one who loved you.\\"Emilia Marryat Norris, Paul Howard's Captivity; and Why He Escaped. Illustrations by E. N. Downard. Griffith and Farran, 1876. Works Illustration by Augusta Marryat from The Children's Pic-Nic and What Came of It (1868) Though Emilia Marryat Norris is known now for writing novels intended for children, her first two were for adults. Her forward to Temper (1854), which advertised her as her father's daughter, stated, \\"A short time before my father died, he desired me to attempt writing. I have followed his wishes; and you have the attempt\\"(Preface). Set in Norfolk, the story begins with the ungovernable temper of a child named Lawrence. While in the nursery, to the horror of his mother, Lady Flora Arden, he flings a knife at a servant maid, resulting in her leg being amputated. In the course of the novel, his temper is seen to be the result of his parents' laughter at his expense in the nursery and encouragement of his childish anger for amusement, as well as emulating their own outbursts of anger. As an adult, Lawrence accidentally murders his sister's fianc√© with a gun in a moment of passion, creating chaos for his family. It was followed by Henry Lyle; or, Life and Existence (1856), a story of a beneficent young man, Henry Lyle, attempting to help several people in his community find self-worth and useful employment; most notably, he helps a young teenager, Willy Benson, overcome his learning difficulties through education, and find a place in society despite his disability. She also wrote Every-day (1861) as a guide to proper child-raising, warning parents against mistreating any one of their children or showing favoritism, which leads to bad effects later in life. Emilia states, \\"Time softens all things: but speak in grown age to one who has passed through a neglected and an unjust childhood, and you will find that the more tangible sorrows of later years have not made so deep an impression as the remembrance of those first half-intelligible griefs.\\"Emilia Marryat Norris, Every-day. Wertheim, Macintosh, and Hunt, 1861, p. 11. All subsequent books were tales of children experiencing life at a young age, or conduct books of advice on how children should behave, beginning with Long Evenings, or, Stories for My Little Friends (1861). The Early Start in Life (1867) promotes the values of godliness, hard work, self-discipline, and the chances offered by the New World. In what appears to have been her only artistic collaboration with a family member, The Children's Pic-Nic and What Came of It (1868) was illustrated by her sister Augusta. It was followed by several other works such as What Became of Tommy (1866), and Alda Graham, and her brother Philip (1872). Emilia used pictures by various illustrators to keep her audience engaged, while simultaneously giving them stories to which they could relate.

It was demolished in 1956. History =Origins= Allen House hotel in 1870 Postcard showing the lobby of the Hotel Allen, Allentown, Pennsylvania about 1912 Theodore Roosevelt speaking from the balcony of the Hotel Allen, 1914 The northeast corner of Center Square (Seventh and Hamilton Streets) in Allentown was the site of several inns and hotels since its founding in 1762. Sometime in 1762 a man named George Wolf established at the corner of Hamilton and Allen (as Seventh Street was then called) an inn. By doing that he became the first known operator of what they called then, ‚Äúa house of entertainment for man and beast‚Äù in little Northampton town. The name of the inn, not recorded until 1773, was the King of Prussia. Reportedly, the inn's sign featured an image that was supposed to represent Frederick the Great, the military monarch who was then occupying the Prussian throne.History's Headlines: Former site of First National Bank in Allentown has rich history Wolf left Allentown in 1768 and his inn passed to other hands. Because of its central location it became a focal point of activity.

Allentown, Pennsylvania: Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987 The inn got a face lift and new lease on life under the name of Allen House, which was adopted about 1859. By the late 1870s, with the arrival of stagecoach lines and railroads bringing more guests than ever, the wooden Allen House hotel was falling apart. It was replaced by a six-story brick and steel hotel, the Hotel Allen. Built in the Victorian Style, it was designed to be the grand hotel of the city. Opened in 1882, the six-story, 150 room building‚Äôs graceful form defined the northeast corner of Center Square. =Victorian Era= The Allen Hotel's first floor included a large lobby with a luxurious sitting room. All rooms also had electric lighting, and some rooms even had private baths. Also several retail stores, including the Koch and Shankweiler men's clothing store were located. An observation tower, located on the seventh floor, offered a panoramic view of the city. During the 1890s, it was connected to both the Lehigh and Consolidated phone systems, the region's two phone companies. The hotel became a landmark in Allentown, hosting businessmen, wealthy travelers, political figures and other important guests to the city. Located in the heart of the Central Business district, it was a stop on the new electric street railway when it opened in 1892, bringing visitors to the city directly from the Lehigh Valley Railroad Station at Third and Hamilton streets. Among those entertained here before speaking engagements at the Lyric Theater (now Miller Symphony Hall) were presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt even spoke in 1914 to a cheering crowd from its balcony. The Hotel Allen‚Äôs food was considered the best in the city and during the summer an orchestra performed regularly on what was called its ‚Äúrustic porch garden.‚Äù. =Jazz Age= After World War I, the level of accommodations in Allentown was on the mind of city leadership. Allentown was growing rapidly due to industrialization and its leading hotels, such as the Allen, as well as the Lafyette and American were deemed as outdated due to their wooden construction. The Hotel Hamilton, next to the Lehigh County Courthouse had burned down in a massive fire in 1919. In 1921 the Hotel Bethlehem had opened and in 1924 the Hotel Easton, both concrete and brick structures. Allentown's city fathers said, that the region's largest city lacked a modern fireproof building like its rivals. Unfortunately it took a tragic, deadly fire for the city to finally get one with the Lafyette Hotel fire in 1926 The opening of the Americus Hotel in 1927 severely affected the Hotel Allen, with the new, larger and modern Americus attracting many of the visitors to Allentown that previously used the Allen. =Decline= The Great Depression and World War II also fueled the decline of the hotel and its finances. The hotel was used extensively during World War II but in the postwar era, it was clear that it had become outdated, and the property was condemned by Commonwealth building inspectors in November 1946. The sudden closure of the hotel forced about 100 permanent residents to be evicted. The owners at the time, the Koch brothers who operated a clothing store on the ground floor, was allowed to remain open. The property was completely rebuilt between 1949 and 1952, the basement and the first three stories were modernized and turned into a three story clothing store. The First National Bank, then located adjacent to the hotel at 13 North Seventh Street purchased the property in 1955. Plans were made to demolish the 70-year-old hotel which began in the spring of 1956. A new First National Bank building in the modified Art Moderne style opened in 1958 and was enlarged in the early 1970s. After a series of bank mergers the First National Bank closed its doors in the early 1990s and the property was vacant for about fifteen years. The First National Bank building was itself demolished in 2012, and is now the site of the new Two City Center office complex, currently under construction with a planned 2014 opening date.Allentown's Hamilton Street to close for demolition, The Morning Call, 21 November 2012 See also * Historical and Notable Sites in Allentown, Pennsylvania References External links * 1940 color photograph of the Allentown Central Business District, showing the Hotel Allen Category:History of Allentown, Pennsylvania Category:Buildings and structures in Allentown, Pennsylvania Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1956 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Pennsylvania Category:Defunct hotels in Pennsylvania ","title":"Hotel Allen (Allentown, Pennsylvania)"},{"id":"39802394","text":"Liv and Maddie, also known as Liv and Maddie: Cali Style for the fourth season, is an American comedy television series created by John D.

It was incorporated in January 1975 by Chinese Filipino entrepreneur Jimmy Gow to operate Uniwide commercial shopping centers such as the lease of commercial spaces within the compound of their malls and department stores. Uniwide had about 2,000 employees. The competing retailers of the 1970s and the 1980s were: COD Department Store, Ever Gotesco Malls, Plaza Fair, Isetann and The Landmark but lagged behind SM Supermalls, Robinsons Malls and Ayala Malls. It had two branches and was set to be close down by the order of Securities and Exchange Commission. History The roots of Uniwide date back to January 1975Brief History of Uniwide when it established in Avenida Rizal as Uniwide Sales Textile Bargain House Center. With the success, the Gow family expanded to ready-to-wear apparel, accessories and then became a complete department store and supermarket chain. The company introduced the mass-oriented warehouse club concept in the country in 1988, establishing a chain of warehouse clubs in prime locations in the country in the next two years, which also started the company's woes. Some of its assets in prime location such as its abandoned building in Cubao, Quezon City (was destroyed by fire in 1996) were already bought by Puregold Price Club Inc. of the Co family. Another unfinished building in Mandaue City, Cebu at that time was supposedly as a warehouse club, which was occupied by slum dwellers and today, the site was subsequently occupied and converted into a shopping centre named Parkmall. The warehouse in Marcos Highway was already demolished and the lot sold to Gokongwei-led Robinsons Land Corporation's commercial centers division to pave the way for Robinsons Metro East and in Libis, Quezon City to pave way for Wilcon Depot. Its remaining warehouse club is in Metromall in Las Pi√±as, Tarlac City, Malolos in Bulacan, Caloocan, Novaliches in Quezon City and Sucat in Para√±aque (these said branches were later became Super 8 Grocery Warehouse in 2006, when these warehouse clubs were sold its stake). From 1992 to 1999, in partnership with RPN-9, they have a quiz show called Battle of the Brains. In 1998, it entered into corporate rehabilitation during the Asian financial crisis. At that time, the company's retail business had a network of eight warehouse clubs and two department stores. Liquidity problems, however, affected earnings. Sales declined from its peak of P14.5 billion in 1997 to just about P4.3 billion in 2000. Many times, they attempted to clear Baguio City Market in Baguio, Benguet to build a mall, but due to the opposition from the vendors, stall owners and associations kept the project on hold and opposition still was around. The Uniwide Coastal Mall was envisioned in the 1990s to become the country's biggest shopping mall complex. It was built on a 10-hectare portion of MBDC's 40-hectare Central Business Park II in Para√±aque City at a time when Cabangis and Rey were UHI's respective chief financial officer and controller. The mall was 90% complete and was partially operational with tenants already occupying the finished parts of the mall fronting Roxas Boulevard prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The mall is currently closed down with a few stores including GALA Bowling Club, Shakey's Pizza, Prodatanet, Jollibee, B.I.R. Para√±aque, Wide Aero Av School, Uniwide Theatre and Movie Hall, Mang Inasal, Hyundai Showroom, Super8 Grocery Warehouse and Dunkin' Donuts. The building is currently converted to a transport terminal for public utility vehicles from Batangas and Cavite. By 2006, Coastal Mall was superseded by SM Mall of Asia. Uniwide's former in- house supermarket chain, Super8 Grocery Warehouse, spun-off from its parent company in 2006 to become Super8 Retail Systems, Inc..

The complex consists of a museum and a monument which commemorates the struggle of Prince Diponegoro, an 18th-century Javanese prince and a National Hero. History The building where the museum stands was handed down to the government of Yogyakarta by the heir of Diponegoro, Raden Ayu Kanjangteng Diponegoro, to function as a monument after signing a transfer letter with Nyi Hadjar Dewantara and Kanjeng Raden Tumenggung Purejodiningrat. Beginning from mid-1968 until 19 August 1969, a monument was built on the pringgitan building that adjoined with the pendopo at the center of the complex. The project was initiated by Major General Surono who was the Commander of the Military District and was inaugurated by President Suharto. This place was then named Sasana Wiratama, Javanese \\"place for soldiers\\". Collection Pangeran Diponegoro monument is a relief on a 20 meters-long and 4 meters-high wall, telling the story of a peaceful Tegalrejo village and the war between Diponegoro and the Dutch colony until his capture in Magelang. On both sides of the monument, there were self-portrait of Pangeran Diponegoro on the west side and the painting of Pangeran Diponegoro who was riding his black horse, ready to wage war, on the east side. Some of the artifacts which originate from Diponegoro includes the broken wall (parts of the original house of Diponegoro), a padasan (place for performing ritual Muselim ablution), and a komboran (a stone container for Diponegoro's horses to get water and food). Other inheritances from Diponegoro are kept in Magelang (a Qur'an, cup and pot, a robe, four tables, and one chair). National Museum of Indonesia at Jakarta kept a horse saddle and a lance. One kris of Diponegoro is still kept in the Netherlands. In front of the building, situated on H.O.S Cokroaminoto Street, there is a statue of Lieutenant General Oerip Soemohardjo with the writing \\"Orde.Contre-Ordre.Desordre!\\" on the east side and a statue of General Sudirman with the writing \\"Jangan Lengah\\" (Indonesian, \\"Don't be inattentive\\") on the west side. These statues represent the place where Indonesian people struggled for their independence. After passing through the gate, there is a two-meter high wall resembling the dome of a mosque with a picture of a giant opposing a dragon on the upper part of it. The picture is a sengkalan memet (a Javanese chronogram) which forms the Javanese sentence Butho Mekso Basuki ning Bawono, denoting the Javanese year of 1825, the onset of Diponegoro war. There are 100 items as the collection of Diponegoro museum, consisting of some original goods of Diponegoro paramilitary troop ranging from war weapons, coins, precious stone and home furniture. Some examples of weapons are lances, kris, swords, arrows, bandil (iron hammer), patrem (a kind of weapon for women), and candrasa (a sharp weapon that looks like a chignon pin used by women spies). There are also some 18th-century household tools made from brass such as betel container and its kecohan (a container in which someone spits after chewing betel), canting (a tool used to make batik) holder, bringsing pot, and various forms of kacip (a tool to slice areca nut as an ingredient to chew betel). There are two sacred weapons kept in this museum, namely a kris with 21 curves named Kyai Omyang, made by an empu (kris maker) who lived during Majapahit time and a sword originating from Demak Kingdom. Those two sacred weapons are believed to be able to prevent disasters. There is also a small statue of Ganesha, the lace of the horses that pull a cart presented by Hamengkubuwono VIII, a couple of loro Blonyo (pedestal/foundation) statues and a pair of decorative lamps. There are some parts of the gamelan (Javanese music instrument) owned by Hamengkubuwono II that was made in 1752 in the forms of a percussion and wilahan bonang made of wood, copper and brass. There is also a cannon in the east of the hall.

The 2013 discovery at El Castillo de Huarmey of a royal Wari tomb containing 60 individuals and three burials of elite women suggests the need to reassess the Wari presence on the coast of Peru. The area around the tomb has been the target of looters for decades. The team named the site, which provided evidence of the Wari Empire. El Castillo de Huarmey was excavated in secret over the course of several months in 2013 to prevent looting. In January 2010, Giersz's team located what appeared to be a subterranean tomb using aerial photographs and geophysical imaging tools on a ridge between two other pyramids. The ridge had long been a dumping site for rubble for tomb robbers. In September 2012 the team found a stone throne room. Below this was a chamber sealed by tons of loose stone fill. The burial chamber of the royal tomb was discovered in early 2013 by a Peruvian-Polish research team, which was led by Milosz Giersz of Poland's University of Warsaw and co-director Roberto Pimentel Nita and funded by the National Geographic Society. The tomb contained 1,200 artifacts, including gold earrings, bronze axes, jewelry made of copper and silver, and silver bowls. The tomb contained 60 human bodies buried in rows in a seated position and clothed in deteriorating textiles. Three side chambers contained three bodies of royal Wari women whose bodies were accompanied by prized possessions, including gold weaving tools. Giersz said \\"We are talking about the first unearthed royal imperial tomb of the Wari.\\" The richness of this mausoleum is a strong indication of the extent to which the Wari controlled this part of northern Peru. Giersz found evidence that the royal bodies had been repeatedly removed from the burial chambers, presumably for royal displays during the Wari era, an indication of royal ancestor worship.

It guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. A TEE as an isolated execution environment provides security features such as isolated execution, integrity of applications executing with the TEE, along with confidentiality of their assets. In general terms, the TEE offers an execution space that provides a higher level of security for trusted applications running on the device than a rich operating system (OS) and more functionality than a 'secure element' (SE). History The Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) first defined TEE in their \\"Advanced Trusted Environment:OMTP TR1\\" standard, defining it as a \\"set of hardware and software components providing facilities necessary to support Applications\\" which had to meet the requirements of one of two defined security levels. The first security level, Profile 1, was targeted against only software attacks and while Profile 2, was targeted against both software and hardware attacks. Commercial TEE solutions based on ARM TrustZone technology, conforming to the TR1 standard, were later launched, such as Trusted Foundations developed by Trusted Logic. Work on the OMTP standards ended in mid 2010 when the group transitioned into the Wholesale Applications Community (WAC). The OMTP standards, including those defining a TEE, are hosted by GSMA. Details The TEE is a standard which creates an isolated environment that runs in parallel with the operating system, providing security for the rich environment. It is intended to be more secure than the User-facing OS. ARM TrustZone TEE is an implementation of the TEE standard. TrustZone TEE is a hybrid approach that utilizes both hardware and software to protect data. It therefore offers a level of security sufficient for many applications. Only trusted applications running in a TEE have access to the full power of a device's main processor, peripherals and memory, while hardware isolation protects these from user installed apps running in a main operating system. Software and cryptographic isolation inside the TEE protect the trusted applications contained within from each other. Service providers, mobile network operators (MNO), operating system developers, application developers, device manufacturers, platform providers and silicon vendors are the main stakeholders contributing to the standardization efforts around the TEE. To prevent simulation of hardware with user-controlled software, a so- called \\"hardware root of trust\\" is used. This is a set of private keys (so- called \\"endorsement keys\\" or \\"provisioned secrets\\") which are embedded directly into the chip during manufacturing (one-time programmable memory such as eFuses are usually used, despite the large area on the chip they take), cannot be changed, and whose public counterparts reside in a manufacturer database, together with a non-secret hash of a public key belonging to the trusted party (usually a chip vendor) which is used to sign trusted firmware alongside the circuits doing cryptographic operations and controlling access. The hardware is designed in a way which prevents all software not signed by the trusted party's key from accessing the privileged features. The public key of the vendor is provided at runtime and hashed; this hash is then compared to the one embedded in the chip. If the hash matches, the public key is used to verify a digital signature of trusted vendor-controlled firmware (such as a chain of bootloaders on Android devices or 'architectural enclaves' in SGX). The trusted firmware is then used to implement remote attestation. An untrusted component of an application required to be attested loads the trusted one into memory. The trusted application is protected from modification by untrusted components with hardware. A nonce is requested by the untrusted party from verifier's server, and is used as a part of a cryptographic authentication protocol, proving integrity of the trusted application. The proof is passed to the verifier, which verifies it. A valid proof cannot be computed in a simulated hardware (i.e. QEMU) because in order to construct it, access to the keys baked into hardware is required; only trusted firmware has access to these keys and/or the keys derived from them or obtained using them. Because only the platform owner is meant to have access to the data recorded in the foundry, the verifying party must interact with the service set up by the vendor. If the scheme is implemented improperly, the chip vendor can track which applications are used on which chip and selectively deny service by returning a message indicating that authentication has not passed. To simulate hardware in a way which enables it to pass remote authentication, an attacker would have to extract keys from the hardware, which is costly because of equipment and reverse-engineering skills required (focused ion beam, scanning electron microscope, microprobing, decapsulation) or even impossible, if the hardware is designed in such a way that reverse- engineering destroys the keys. In some cases, the keys are unique for each piece of hardware, so that a key extracted from one chip is useless for another ones. Though deprivation of ownership is not an inherent property of TEEs (it is possible to design the system in a way that allows only the user who has obtained ownership of the device first to control the system), in practice all such systems in consumer electronics are intentionally designed so as to allow chip manufacturers to control access to attestation and its algorithms. It allows manufacturers to grant access to TEEs only to software developers who have a (usually commercial) business agreement with the manufacturer, and to enable such use cases as tivoization and DRM. Uses There are a number of use cases for the TEE. Though not all possible use cases exploit the deprivation of ownership, TEE is usually used exactly for this. =Premium Content Protection/Digital Rights Management= Note: Much TEE literature covers this topic under the definition \\"premium content protection\\" which is the preferred nomenclature of many copyright holders. Premium content protection is a specific use case of Digital Rights Management (DRM), and is controversial among some communities, such as the Free Software Foundation. It is widely used by copyrights holders to restrict the ways in which end users can consume content such as 4K high definition films. The TEE is a suitable environment for protecting digitally encoded information (for example, HD films or audio) on connected devices such as smart phones, tablets and HD televisions. This suitability comes from the ability of the TEE to deprive owner of the device from reading stored secrets, and the fact that there is often a protected hardware path between the TEE and the display and/or subsystems on devices. The TEE is used to protect the content once it is on the device: while the content is protected during transmission or streaming by the use of encryption, the TEE protects the content once it has been decrypted on the device by ensuring that decrypted content is not exposed to the environment not approved by app developer OR platform vendor. =Mobile financial services= Mobile Commerce applications such as: mobile wallets, peer-to-peer payments, contactless payments or using a mobile device as a point of sale (POS) terminal often have well-defined security requirements. TEEs can be used, often in conjunction with near field communication (NFC), SEs and trusted backend systems to provide the security required to enable financial transactions to take place. In some scenarios, interaction with the end user is required, and this may require the user to expose sensitive information such as a PIN, password or biometric identifier to the mobile OS as a means of authenticating the user. The TEE optionally offers a trusted user interface which can be used to construct user authentication on a mobile device. =Authentication= The TEE is well-suited for supporting biometric ID methods (facial recognition, fingerprint sensor and voice authorization), which may be easier to use and harder to steal than PINs and passwords. The authentication process is generally split into three main stages: * Storing a reference \\"template\\" identifier on the device for comparison with the \\"image\\" extracted in next stage. * Extracting an \\"image\\" (scanning the fingerprint or capturing a voice sample, for example). * Using a matching engine to compare the \\"image\\" and the \\"template\\". A TEE is a good area within a mobile device to house the matching engine and the associated processing required to authenticate the user. The environment is designed to protect the data and establish a buffer against the non-secure apps located in mobile OS. This additional security may help to satisfy the security needs of service providers in addition to keeping the costs low for handset developers. =Enterprise, government, and cloud= The TEE can be used by governments, enterprises, and cloud service providers to enable the secure handling of confidential information on mobile devices and on server infrastructure. The TEE offers a level of protection against software attacks generated in the mobile OS and assists in the control of access rights. It achieves this by housing sensitive, ‚Äòtrusted‚Äô applications that need to be isolated and protected from the mobile OS and any malicious malware that may be present. Through utilizing the functionality and security levels offered by the TEE, governments and enterprises can be assured that employees using their own devices are doing so in a secure and trusted manner. Likewise, server-based TEEs help defend against internal and external attacks against backend infrastructure. =Secure modular programming= With the rise of software assets and reuses, modular programming is the most productive process to design software architecture, by decoupling the functionalities into small independent modules. As each module contains everything necessary to execute its desired functionality, the TEE allows to organize the complete system featuring a high level of reliability and security, while preventing each module from vulnerabilities of the others. In order for the modules to communicate and share data, TEE provide means to securely have payloads sent/received between the modules, using mechanisms such as objects serialization, in conjunction with proxies.

Its odor is sweet and \\"disagreeable\\". The compound is volatile at standard temperature and pressure and explodes on contact with air. It is a toxic compound. It displays nephrotoxic effects to rats, but not to humans. It can be made from the compound trichloroethylene. Dichloroacetylene is not soluble in water.  Properties  Dichloroacetylene explodes upon reaching its boiling point of 33¬∞ Celsius (91.4¬∞ Fahrenheit). However, it is insoluble in water. Dichloroacetylene can explode when heated or upon contact with air. It also engages in vigorous reaction with materials that are oxidizers. It also engages in violent reactions with acids. Dichloroacetylene is an oil at standard temperature and pressure. It has a density of 1.2 times that of water while in its liquid state and 3.3 times that of air while in its gaseous state. Dichloroacetylene can detonate if it is set on fire in an enclosed space. It can also burn in the presence of chlorine to produce phosgene. The stability of dichloroacetylene increases in the presence of large amounts of trichloroethylene. A mixture of dichloroacetylene with ether forms an azeotrope. This azeotrope has a boiling point of 32¬∞ Celsius. Additionally, when dichloroacetylene is mixed with ether, the likelihood of it exploding is reduced. Unlike the related acetylenes, dichloroacetylene does not readily polymerize. Polydichloroacetylene is however claimed as a white solid.  Occurrence, production and applications  Dichloroacetylene is not produced commercially. However, a 1980 report claimed that it is produced as a by-product in the production process of vinylidene chloride. The compound is also possible to produce by pyrolysis of some types of chlorohydrocarbons. For instance, it can be formed from trichloroethylene. This primarily occurs in the presence of bases with pHs between 11 and 13. It is also possible to produce dichloroacetylene from trichloroethylene at low concentrations by running the trichloroethylene through nitrogen at 120¬∞ Celsius in the presence of dry potassium hydroxide. Despite the existing methods of production, there are no known commercial applications for dichloroacetylene. Additionally, there is another method of producing dichloroacetylene. This method produces high- purity dichloroacetylene in gram amounts. This method involves the pyrolysis of dichloromaleic anhydride at a temperature of 850¬∞ Celsius. Dichloroacetylene produced via this method does not need to be separated from any solvents. Dichloroacetylene can be produced with 82% purity by the pyrolysis of difluoromaleic anhydride at a temperature of 950¬∞ Celsius. It is the haloacetylene produced in the highest amounts by this reaction. Dichloroacetylene can occur and be stable in air at concentrations of up to 200 parts per million if certain other compounds are also present.  Biological role and toxicity  Dichloroacetylene has a toxic effect on humans who are exposed to it. The most common effect that the compound has on humans is the development of neurological disorders. These disorders can persist for any amount of time between a number of days and a number of years. Exposure to the chemical can also cause a large range of other symptoms, including a headache, vomiting and nausea, jaw pain, cranial nerve palsy, appetite loss, and acute lung edema. Dichloroacetylene's level of carcinogenity in humans is not classifiable, although there are small amounts of evidence that suggest that the chemical is carcinogenic in animals. Studies on male rats and rabbits have shown that inhalation of dichloroacetylene can cause tubular necrosis, focal necrosis, and other nephrotoxic effects. Additionally, the rabbits that were given dichloroacetylene experienced hepatotoxic and neuropathological effects. Inhalation of dichloroacetylene also causes benign tumors of the livers and kidneys of rats. The chemical also caused increased incidences of lymphomas. It also causes weight loss in animals. 3.5% of a dose of dichloroacetylene remains in the corpses of male Wistar rats. The LD50s of mice exposed to dichloroacetylene are 124 parts per million for a 1-hour exposure by inhalation and 19 parts per million for a 6-hour exposure by inhalation. The chemical is ingested primarily through glutathione-dependent systems. Glutathione also reacts with it. Hepatitic and renal glutathione S-transferases serve as catalysts to this reaction. While dichloroacetylene is nephrotoxic in rats, it does not show any signs of nephrotoxicity in humans. Dichloroacetylene has mutagenic effects on Salmonella typhimurium. The maximum safe concentration of dichloroacetylene in air is 0.1 parts per million. It is unsafe to store dichloroacetylene in close proximity to potassium, sodium, or aluminum powder. Like trichloroethylene, dichloroacetylene is metabolized to DCVC in vivo.  History  Dichloroacetylene was first synthesized in 1930. It has been characterized by IR and mass spectrometry. However, there is no reported nuclear magnetic resonance data pertaining to it as of 1999. According to the Department of Transportation, it is forbidden to ship dichloroacetylene.

It is named after Sir Benjamin Hammet, who had a bill passed through parliament to allow him to build the street in 1788. The street includes four listed buildings: numbers 4 and 5‚Äì8, 9‚Äì12, 13‚Äì17, and number 18 with 33 Fore Street. The first three buildings are grade II* listed, while the last is grade II listed, and together with the Church of St Mary Magdalene and the listed buildings in Church Square, the English Heritage consider them to \\"form an extremely important group.\\" History Sir Benjamin Hammet was born in Taunton around 1736, and was a Member of Parliament for the town from 1782 until his death in 1800. In the late 1780s, a number of Acts of Parliament were passed to make improvement to town and city centres, and Hammet carried such an Improvement Act for Taunton through in 1788. The Act allowed Hammet to purchase two houses on Fore Street, one occupied and the other empty, and demolish them to make way for the new road. The road built ran directly towards the Church of St Mary Magdalene, which had previously been accessible only via a narrow lane. Hammet Street is wide at its narrowest point, designed to allow carriages to travel to the church without endangering pedestrians. In his history of Taunton, Joshua Toulmin describes the terraces along Hammet Street as \\"handsome houses\\", and praises the way the street opened up the view of the church from the town centre. The original houses remain, and the ground floors of many are currently used as estate agents. Listed buildings Number 8 with 4‚Äì7 to the left Hammet Street has four listed building entries. On the north side, numbers 4‚Äì8 make up one entry, while on the south side, numbers 9‚Äì12 are considered one entry, number 13‚Äì17 another, and number 18 forms a separate entry, along with number 33 Fore Street. Both sides of the road are of similar design, consisting of the original eighteenth century three-storey terraces of brown brick, with each house separated by plain pilasters, and continuous eaves cornice. Each property has five sash windows in plain reveals. The roofs are a mix of tile and slate, and retain the original rainwater pipes.

One of the last members of the genus Stephanorhinus, it is considered to be a typical component of the interglacial Palaeoloxodon large faunal assemblage in Europe. It is most closely related to the Woolly rhinoceros and the Sumatran rhinoceros. In Europe it was sympatric with the narrow nosed rhinoceros S. hemitoechus. It is noted for its very large size, among the largest of Pleistocene rhinoceroses, approaching that of Elasmotherium.  Etymology and taxonomy  The first part of the genus name is derived from that of King Stephen I of Hungary, and the second part from 'rhinos' (œÅŒπŒΩŒøœÇ, meaning \\"nose\\"), as with Dicerorhinus. The species name was given by Georg Friedrich von J√§ger in 1839 for Kirchberg an der Jagst in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, where the type specimens had been found.Georg Friedrich J√§ger: √úber die fossilen S√§ugetiere welche in W√ºrttemberg in verschiedenen Formationen aufgefunden worden sind, nebst geognostischen Bemerkungen √ºber diese Formationen. C. Erhard Verlag, Stuttgart, 1835‚Äì39 It is often known in English (and equivalents in other languages) as Merck's rhinoceros after Carl Heinrich Merck, who gave the initial name to the species in 1784 as Rhinoceros incisivus, that is now considered a nomen oblitum, and who after a widely used junior synonym of the species, Rhinoceros/Dicerorhinus mercki (historically several alternate spellings) was named by Johann Jakob Kaup in 1841.Johann Jakob Kaup: Akten der Urwelt oder Osteologie der urweltlichen S√§ugethiere und Amphibien. Darmstadt, Verlag des Herausgebers, 1841  Origin  The origin of the species is obscure, with various authors suggesting either a European or Asian origin. The earliest definitive records are from Choukoutien Locality 13, in Fangshan District near Beijing at around the Early-Middle Pleistocene transition, though the older records of Stephanorhinus lantianensis and Stephanorhinus yunchuchenensis have been suggested to be synonyms of S. kirchbergensis by some sources. It appears in Europe during the early Middle Pleistocene between 0.7-0.6 Ma, existing alongside the already present S. hundsheimensis. A complete mitochondrial genome obtained from a permafrost specimen and proteome studies suggest that it is more closely related to the Woolly rhinoceros than the Sumatran rhinoceros, but its relationship to other Stephanorhinus species remains unclear.  Range  Range of Merck's rhinoceros, excluding arctic localitiesIts range spans from Europe to East Asia, but appears to be absent from the Iberian Peninsula.Billa, E.M.E. 2011a. Occurrences of Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis (J√§ger, 1839) (Mammalia, Rhinocerotidae) in Eurasia - An account. Acta Palaeontologica Romaniae 7: 17-40Billia, E.M.E., Zervanov√°, J., 2015. New Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis(Mammalia, Rhinocerotidae) records in Eurasia. Addenda to a previous work. Gortania.Geologia, Paleontologia, Paletnologia36, 55‚Äì68. Its range extended into the Arctic Circle, with a 70‚Äì48 thousand-year-old skull known from arctic Yakutia in the Chondon River valley and a late Middle Pleistocene aged lower jaw from the Yana River valley. Teeth are known from caves in Primorsky Krai , suggested to date between 50,000 and 25,000 years ago based on dates of other bones found in the deposit, which are the easternmost known records. A tooth of S. cf. kirchbergensis of an unknown age is known from the Lut Desert in eastern Iran. It is fairly common throughout the Pleistocene in North China, but is a rarer component of South Chinese assemblages, being known from around 30 localities in the region. Antoine (2012) states that D. choukoutienensis, D. lantianensis, and D. yunchuchenensis are local names for the taxon, without elaboration. Its range was strongly controlled by glacial cycles, with the species experiencing repeated cycles of expansion and contraction as the ice sheets advanced, this accounts for its relative rarity of its remains in comparison to the woolly rhinoceros. The species' range underwent significant reduction during the Last Glacial Period, with the youngest records from Italy being in MIS 4 and 3. The youngest reliable records in China are from the Rhino Cave in Hubei, which is early Late Pleistocene in age. Though less definitive remains are known from near Harbin in Heilongjiang, which are thought to be 20 kya in age. Records from Migong Cave just south of the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges area are suggested to date to MIS 2. It is presumed to have had a preference for closed forest and woodland habitats, as opposed the to open grassland habitats favoured by S. hemitoechus. Comparison of the head angle of Merck's rhinoceros (top) with that of that of S. hemitoechus and the Woolly rhinoceros (middle and bottom, respectively)  Diet  Merck's rhinoceros appears to have been a mixed feeder with a more specialised diet than S. hundsheimensis and the grazing diet hypothesised for S. hemitoechus. Despite their morphological differences, its preferences were not significantly different than S. hemitoechus, suggesting dietary convergence due to low habitat variability during the Pleistocene. Analysis of plant material embedded within teeth from the Neumark-Nord locality in Germany found remains of Populus, Quercus, Crataegus, Pyracantha, Urtica and Nymphaea as well as indeterminate remains of Betulaceae, Rosaceae, and Poaceae.Jan van der Made und Ren√© Grube: The rhinoceroses from Neumark-Nord and their nutrition.

A turning point in coal production came in 1952 with the opening of the first open pit (Fields A) which started mass surface mining of lignite. Opening of new mines and processing facilities fallowed.Rudarski basen Kolubara. Rudarstvo staro 117 godina. Retrieved 9. 6. 2014 The mining projects' original intention was to secure a stable, constant supply of energy and electricity for the country, which is why the Serbian federal government considers these projects of national interest. =Environmental Improvement project= In 2011 Kolubara started the Environmental Improvement project in order to improve the mining conditions and effects on the environment as well as the local communities involved. The estimated cost of this project is approximately EUR 165.2; the initiative is financed by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development EBRD (EUR 80 million ), the German state development bank KfW (EUR 75 million) and state electricity company Elektroprivreda Srbije (EUR 80 million). According to information provided by EBRD, the investment will generate benefits resulting in an environmental improvement of the Kolubara complex. The main benefits being more efficient and cleaner extraction of natural resources, supplying the existing power plants with lignite of a uniform quality (that will lead to more stable and efficient operations and controlled uniform emissions which will result in lower levels of CO2 and other pollutants as well as reduced wear and tear and maintenance costs) and helping Serbia to achieve emission limits set by the recently introduced EU Directive 2010/75 on Industrial Emissions.Information about the project on EBRD webpage. The Environmental Improvement project's goal is to also introduce new equipment, strategies and techniques to the workers and planners of Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS). The purpose of introducing the new technologies and methods is to increase efficiency both economically speaking and environmentally speaking. Controversial issues =Social impact= For the last 10 years the Kolubara mine basin has been expanding towards the settlements causing conflicts between inhabitants and mines. This problem affects around 6000 families. During the last decade, Elektroprivreda Srbije has moved hundreds of households, two complete villages and partially 10 villages. One of the main villages impacted was Vreoci, which resides in central Serbia. The project required a new mine pit on the location of the Vreoci graveyard as well as the relocation of more than 1,000 households. Underneath the graveyard lies approximately 50 million tons of coal, a requirement to get to the 600 million tons of lignite which would help the project but damage the local community's burial grounds and cultural landmark. Despite the heavy protests from the villagers, the EBRD loan was approved and the excavation of the graves continued. These protests have been met with police intervention and a series of blockades preventing the villages into the graveyard. The villagers asked for their houses to be relocated first so that shelter was secured, yet that process has not been as successful as promised. The lack of progress in the resettlement phase of the project has caused villagers to live in sub-par conditions and in locations with high air and ground pollution. Further protests ensued, such as street protests and hunger strikes. Resettlement caused by the Tamnava West expansion in 2003 was not done according to good standards either, the main reason being shortage of funds which led to slowing down of the land acquisition and development of the proposed infrastructure. In the end, they were never conducted, which diminished credibility of Elektroprivreda Srbije in the eyes of inhabitants. With continued expansion of the mine, the relocation of households became urgent and residents were under enormous pressure to accept financial compensation and leave the territory designated for coal excavation. The value of their property was often underestimated.CEKOR Complaint to the EBRD Project Complaint Mechanism submitted on 1. 10. 2013. =Environmental Impact= In spite of the Environmental improvement project carried out in 2011, there are still various environmental consequences of the mining work in Kolubara complex such as gas releases (carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone etc.), pollution of water supply and deterioration of the ground. 2013 Landslide In May 2013 the overburden of field B of the Kolubara lignite mine collapsed and caused a landslide that destroyed seven houses and one road in the town of Junkovac.

Course The source of the river is a series of springs that occur on the northern flank of Cleeve Hill, on the edge of the Cotswold Hills. These springs occur where the permeable Jurassic limestone, meets the impermeable Upper Lias mudstone and clays that underlie most of the Isbourne catchment. The river flows from Cleeve Hill in a steep valley in a northerly direction through the hamlet of Postlip, before reaching the town of Winchcombe which it passes along its eastern side. Beyond the town, it continues northwards to Toddington, through the grounds of Toddington Manor, and then past the village of Wormington. The river then crosses into Worcestershire and is joined by the Laverton brook, before it reaches the village of Sedgeberrow. Flowing directly north the Isbourne passes through the village of Hinton on the Green, it then continues through an area of market gardens on the outskirts of Evesham, and passes under the Pershore road, before joining the River Avon near Hampton. Catchment The Isbourne catchment covers an area of and lies between the Badsey Brook to the east, the Merry Brook and Carrant Brook to the west with the Cotswolds to the south. It has an average annual rainfall of , which is somewhat drier than the average for England at . Land use in the catchment is predominantly rural, with 80 percent made up from a mixture of arable, horticulture and pasture; the remainder being woodland, with a minor fraction of urbanised area of less than 2 percent. In terms of geology, apart from the headwaters which are underlain by the Cotswold limestone, the majority of catchment is Lias clay. This impermeable clay means that Isbourne can become responsive in terms of runoff to heavy rainfall events. Flooding The Isbourne has a history of flooding along its course, especially in Sedgeberrow, the most recent occasion being in summer 2007.

St Johnston worked and studied part-time, studying at Croydon Polytechnic and later Sir John Cass College before gaining an external London University degree in Mathematics. Early career In 1953, St Johnston left the British Non- Ferrous Metals Research Association and joined Borehamwood Laboratories of Elliott Brothers (London) Ltd, where she worked in the Theory Division. The company was an early computer company and had produced its first computer in 1950. St Johnston learned to programme at the company and also at the 1954 Cambridge Summer School on Programming and, showing a real flair for programming, began working on EDSAC and the Elliott 400 and 800 series computers. By 1954, St Johnston was responsible for the programming of the Elliott 153 Direction Finding (DF) digital computer for the Admiralty and soon after for programming Elliott‚Äôs own payroll computer; her work was said to have been inventive and structured, but also very accurate, hardly ever requiring ‚Äòde-bugging‚Äô.  Vaughan Computers  Shortly after her marriage to Andrew St Johnston - head of the Elliott computing department - in 1958, St Johnston founded Vaughan Programming Services (VPS) in Hertfordshire in 1959, taking software contracts, and training and hiring additional programmers as needed. On its tenth anniversary in 1969, company literature stated that \\"VPS was the first registered independent Software unit in the UK (February 1959), that was not a part of a computer manufacturer, not a part of a computer bureau, not a part of a users' organisation and not a part of a consultancy operation.\\"VPS Press Release, February 1969 as quoted by Simon Lavington.

The Computer Journal (2009) 52 (3): 378-387. doi: 10.1093/comjnl/bxn019 Very significant contracts came to St Johnston and VPS, such as programming early nuclear power stations, but in 1970 she branched out into hardware, producing her own computer, the 4M, and the company changed its name to Vaughan Systems and Programming in 1975 to reflect the new area of work. One of the 4M Vaughan computers is in The National Museum of Computing. St Johnston and Vaughan produced software for companies like the BBC, Unilever, and GEC, flight simulators for the RAF and software that provided real-time information for passengers on British Rail, the type of work for which the company became most well known. The company became well known for transport signalling and display systems.Porter, C. (2007) Obituary: Dina St Johnston. IRSE News, Issue 127, September, p. 32.  Later life  In 1996, Vaughan Systems and Programming was sold to Harmon International, an American railway signalling company. St Johnston continued programming until the mid-1990s. She retired in 1999 and died on 30 June/1 July 2007.

The church was refurbished in Gothic in the 15th century, and includes a rose window alluding to a miracle of Saint Nicholas.

Nawab Najabat Khan was killed during the Battle of Kunjpura at his fort on 17 October 1760. It was this event which led to the Third Battle of Panipat, which Ahmed Shah Abdali avenged for the death of his comrades and kin at Kunjpura. Early life Najabat Khan was born in Ghourghushti, Mohalla Ishaq Zai in a house near the pond, on top of which now stands a girls school. As a young man, Najabat Khan left this village and his poor family to search for work in larger cities of India. Much of his early life is described by village elders in folklore. It was storied that he left as a young man towards ‚ÄúHindustan‚Äù to seek work. On his travels, he assisted merchants by carrying their loads in exchange for food. On one occasion, he lightened the stock of oats by consuming from the sack on his back (this was agreed to compensate Najabat Khan for his assistance), to the owners shock he had found that almost a third of the contents had been consumed. According to folklore, he possessed amazing qualities such as strength, honesty and fortune. Kunjpura chiefdom In 1748 he obtained a sanad from the Afghan conqueror Ahmed Shah Abdali, also called Durani, who was then in the height of his power in Northern India, granting him a \\"hereditary jagir\\" of 149 villages. The villages were declared to be inam, or revenue-free, and he was to enjoy thenceforth the revenue payable to the Imperial Government, subject to the obligation of maintaining order in his ilaqa or possessions. These villages were in Karnal district, and it was from this base that he fought more battles against Hill Rajas. In the 1729 he founded Kujnpura and built a fort there. The fort was renowned for its strength and strategic position. He became a nawab after winning the respect of the Imperial leadership in Delhi. In early 18th century Maratha Empire became the became the primary power in the Indian Subcontinent. Afghan invader Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded north and northwestern India. Small regional powers asked for help from Abdali against the armies of Marathas, who occupied Mughal areas following the death of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Nawab Najabat Khan joined the army of Ahmad Shah Abdali and was killed before the Battle of Panipat in the Battle of Kunjpura, in which the Marathas defeated the Afghans.Third Battle of Panipat by Abhas Verma Bharatiya Kala Prakashan His direct descendants had embroiled in very costly legal disputes over inheritance issues - these were ultimately settled by British judiciary who were occupying India at the time. After the partition of India, the last Nawab of Kunjpura, Nawab Ibrahim Ali Khan, migrated to Lahore in Pakistan, and died in 1953. The Sarkhel tribe claim to be descended from Nawab Najabat Khan through his elder brother Zabita Khan. It is stated in Tareekh Kunjpura he was of Zakka Khel clan of Yusufzai tribe. There is no other reference to a tribe or clan called Zakka Khel, therefore it is assumed that the Nawab's Indian descendants may be mistaken as to the origins of the clan. Nawab Najabat Khan's elder brother Zabita Khan returned to Ghorghushti without claim to any of endowment from the land in Kunjpura. Zabita Khan's descendants now live in the town of Ghourghushti. The ancestral home in Mohalla Ishaq Zai is still owned by the descendants of Nawab Najabat Khan's brother, which has attracted well-wishers from Kunjpura, Lahore, Karachi.\\"Tazkira Nawab Najabat Khan\\" by Akbar Khan (himself a Salar Khel), There is a mention of Nawab Najabat Khan in the Imperial Gazetteer of India V.16 that he was Ghorghusht Pathan Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 16, p. 27.

History The museum building was initially built in 1933 as the Hsinchu Municipal Theater or Yule Theater. It was the first luxury theater at that time with air conditioner in Taiwan with a capacity of 500 audiences. In 1944, the second floor of the building was heavily damaged by aerial bombing during the Second Sino-Japanese War by the Allied Forces. In 1945 after the handover of Taiwan to China, the theater was rebuilt and opened as the Kuomin Theater in 1946. It subsequently attracted huge crowds as a movie house. It was used as a venue for concert halls and even army recruitment drive. Due to its declining profits contributed from the increasing usage of rental videos, the theater had remained idle for several years since 1991. The theater was reopened in 1996 to service the Hsinchu City venue for cultural events organized as part of the national arts festival. The reopening sparked renewed interest among local movie-related people. Subsequently, the Chinese Taipei Film Archive was commissioned to draft plan for the establishment of the Image Museum at the theater. In 1998, the Council for Cultural Affairs provided funding for the yearlong restoration project. On 21 May 2000 the Image Museum was finally opened and the building was renamed the same as the museum. Mission The purpose of the museum is to preserve the cultural experience of the Kuomin Theater and to serve as a shared image space for the city residents. The museum was also built to promote and show the alternative and older movies, as well as to archive, display, do research on cinema-related items and promote cinema education. Architecture The building was built with a combination of classical Roman style and Arabian architecture style. Exhibition The museum often holds movie exhibitions to promote humanistic and artistic films and also films reminiscent of the past that were made independently by Taiwanese producers. It has been used to collect the movie cultural products, exhibitions, researchers and education. Activities The museum has held many activities such as the Animated Cartoon Camp, Movie Study Meeting and Cultivation of Documentary Capability Camp. Transportation The museum is accessible within walking distance northwest from Hsinchu Station of the Taiwan Railways.

Outstanding.\\" - commented the world-famous musician on Kayamar's winning piece. Between 2011‚Äì2013, he was the secretary general of the Jeunesses Musicales Hungary, the Hungarian branch of the largest youth music NGO in the world. =Marketing= L√°szl√≥ √Ågoston's marketing career had a kickstart as the online marketing advisor of the most prestigious Hungarian cultural institution, the Hungarian State Opera from 2012 to 2015. Beside creating marketing campaigns his main task was to help rebuilding and designing a new IT-system of the whole organization. During these years the Opera House received various national and international awards in the field of marketing including the Silver Dolphin and the Black Dolphin (for the \\"best music\\") in the 5th Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards 2014. Later he designed online campaigns mainly for projects with public interest including the H√°tt√©r Society, the main LGBTQI association of Hungary or study skills training for children. =Moltopera= After graduating in 2011 from the Franz Liszt Academy of Music he instantly founded Moltopera, a company of young opera singers aiming to make the genre of opera \\"understandable and likable\\" again, even for young audiences. Moltopera became known and popular very soon, already they 3rd performance ever was given in the great hall of Palace of Arts in front of 400 renowned opera managers of the world in the showcase of International Artist Managers' Association congress. After this occasion Moltopera received invitation to one of the largest European youth festivals, the Sziget Festival, to the National Theatre of P√©cs. and, on 3 November 2012, they gave their first all night performance (Mozart's Magic flute) at the Festival Theater. Moltopera debuted at the Hungarian State Opera with the Zs√≥fi Ger√©b-directed L'isola disabitata on 23 November 2014. Because of the sudden illness of the baritone protagonist, L√°szl√≥ √Ågoston had to save the performance learning the role and the direction in less than 36 hours. He debuted as a singer in the Hungarian State Opera in this emergency situation earning the critics' praise. After the very successful and critically acclaimed debut of Moltopera (even featured among the best directions of the 2014/2015 season in Hungary), they became regular guest performers in the Hungarian State Opera with a new premi√©re every year. (The Hopping from the Seraglio in 2015/2016 - a children's version of The Abduction from the Seraglio), Two women (contemporary opera of Samu Gryllus in 2016/2017). Moltopera Germany Moltopera-members with president of the Bundestag, Prof. Dr. Norbert Lammert in the Landtag of the Free State of Saxony In 2013, Moltopera Germany was founded by young German cultural managers in G√∂rlitz in cooperation with the Hungarian members. Their first concert took place at the Landtag of the Free State of Saxony in 2013. Later Moltopera Germany mainly performed √Ågoston's classical music educational performances in German schools in the G√∂rlitz area. =Classical music education= √Ågoston has been giving lectures about classical music under the title of \\"One can love it!\\" from the very beginning of his career. His participation-based, interactive performances unique approach contains elements from a teacher's aspect to even the world of stand-up comedy. He performs in various venues from schools and universities through festivals to theaters. =Blog= L√°szl√≥ √Ågoston started his blog in March 2016 and reached the 100 000 followers' threshold extremely quick, almost in one year. In the summer of 2018, their number has grown over 130 000. He mainly posts about human rights, promoting gay rights, women's rights, about immigration and personal issues. Controversy √Ågoston is known as a loud but moderate critic of Viktor Orb√°n. He often conducts social experiments to make people question their political beliefs. The most well known among these was a post stating that Hungary is a welcoming country for Muslim people, Hungarians should learn more about Sharia law and respect the Muslim culture. He even advertised this post among the followers of Viktor Orb√°n, and his governing party, the Fidesz, receiving fierce and vulgar criticism. Soon he revealed that the words he used were exact quotes of Viktor Orb√°n's speech in front of Muslim bankers. The experiment soon went viral and on the same day unknown hackers attacked his server, blocking the content from the visitors for weeks. His opposition to Orban's politics and enthusiastic defence of the human rights made him an often attacked persona in the Hungarian public talk even though he is known for his very calm and modest style. =Sexual education and polyamory= L√°szl√≥ √Ågoston is openly polyamorous. He founded Nonmono, an educational website that organizes educational events on the topics of ethical non-monogamy, like open relationships, open marriages, the swinger lifestyle and polyamory.

History It's the most modern building in Xativa of the three conserved buildings of crucer√≠a vault, and the only one without any ogival arch. The hermitage is of gothic-flamenco style and it was built by the middle of the 15th century. Later work (adding a high choir and starry vault) was helped in part by Rodrigo Borgia. The building is rectangular, with buttresses and smooth semicircular segments. The ship has three bays with ribbed vaults separated by transverse arches. The placement of some trumpets in the angles transform the head into a false apse. The nerves of the arches rest to half height it has more than enough cantilevers that are flat in the ship and esculturados in the apse.

The story of the novel is woven around a mosque and its surroundings. The key figure is Khan Bahadur Pookkoya Thangal of the rich Arakkal family whose character is a rare mixture of dignity, benevolence and insatiable lust. Smarakasilakal is widely regarded as the author's masterpiece. Punathil said in an interview that it is his only novel and everything else that he has written subsequently is a repetition of it with some changes. The novel won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1978 and Sahitya Akademi Award in 1980. As of February 2013, more than 65,000 copies of the novel have been sold. Background In his autobiography Nashtajathakam, Kunjabdulla recalls that the seeds of Smarakasilakal were sown at a screening of Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali in Aligarh. The novel was conceived on a large canvas and developed from the images he had formed of his hometown and its people as a child in pre-independent Malabar. Most of the characters in this novel were real-life people he knew from his hometown.Anand Kochukudy (29 October 2017). \\"Both life and literature were unconventional for Malayalam writer Punathil Kunjabdulla (1940-2017)\\". Scroll.in. Retrieved 29 October 2017. Plot summary Smarakasilakal is set in a predominantly Muslim North Malabar village. It is the story of a feudal lord Khan Bahadur Pookkoya Thangal of the rich Arakkal family who could build a world of his own in his village. The mosque and its cemetery weave a background of traditions and legends for the tale. Every character reflects some aspect of the social set up, at the same time lives as a person of individuality. Thangal stands head and shoulders above every other character with his unbounded generosity and insatiable lust. The empire built by this man crumbles as he is killed by one of the young men whose wives he has ravished. The steward of the house grows into a tyrant. Thangal's daughter Pookunjeebi is sacrificed at the altar of wealth; his adopted son Kunjali burning for justice seems to place his trust on revolution as the only remedy for the ills that afflict society.

It was situated on the brow of a hill, sloping southward, about 450 feet above sea level, and commanding extensive views of the district. In 1900 the New College estate comprised 34 acres and included a vegetable garden, a farm, two Fives Courts (35 x 28), a Gymnasium (60 x 16), a Workshop, 2 Tennis Courts, a Cinder Court and a bicycle track. The Boys' Department comprised a large Dining Hall and Assembly Room (50 x 22), with a raised platform for Choir and Organ for Divine Service, Three Class Rooms, a School Parlour, a Library, a Music Room, a Laboratory, a Bath and Dressing Room, Lavatory, Boot and Two Cloak Rooms. The Senior Dormitory was fitted with dressing cubicles as recommended by Dr. Clement Dukes in his work on Health at School, and adopted at The Leys School, Cambridge. There was an Intermediate Dormitory and two smaller dormitories for younger boys. All the rooms were heated with hot water pipes, and ventilated on the most approved principles. Special attention was given to the sanitary arrangements.https://archive.org/details/armstrongsillust00jlaruoft Rev Haslam continued to be Principal until his death in 1917 when he was buried at Harlow Hill Cemetery.http://www.gravestonephotos.com/public/gravedetails.php?available=yes\`=172277&personid;=365944 After the First World War New College experienced a short-term boom, and from 1919 to 1923 more than a hundred boys were in residence.

After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the building was converted into a police station. In 1989, the station was relocated to its new place and the building was left idle for years. In 1997, Huwei Township Office hosted the National Festival of Culture and Arts which made people aware of the historical value of the building. During the preparation of the festival, local government officials discussed the historical value and preservation possibility of the building. In the end, they decided to preserve the building and buildings nearby. Afterwards, Yunlin County Government applied subsidies to Council for Cultural Affairs. In 1999, the county government received NT$20 million of subsidy to restore the building, in which the county government also provided additional NT$8 million. In early 2000, the county government commissioned National Yunlin University of Science and Technology to make the planning report. Detailed planning and open tender were completed in October of the same year. The restoration work was completed by December 2004. In January 2005, meeting to discuss the building layout and future operational plan was made. In April 2007, the interior design was completed and the museum was officially opened in November the same year. In April 2009, the Yunlin County Culture Foundation took over the management of the museum. Architecture The building is a courtyard house with a 2.5-story wooden structure.

Chinatown. Baxter Street () is a narrow thoroughfare that runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction in the borough of Manhattan in New York City in the United States in North America. It lies between Mulberry Street and Centre Street. It runs through Little Italy and the edge of Chinatown. Today, it runs one-way southbound from Grand Street to Hogan Place, and one-way northbound for its southernmost block from Worth Street to Hogan Place. Originally named Orange Street, Baxter Street was famous as the primary street to form the notorious Five Points intersection (originally a regular corner of Orange and Cross Streets, and then, Anthony Street, which was later renamed Worth Street, was cut through to the intersection in 1817,Anbinder p.15 bisecting one of the four corners into two, so that the resulting junction consisted of five ‚Äúpoints‚Äù on a map). History of alignment Previous to the middle of the eighteenth century, the area was still undeveloped. Orange Street is first shown in a 1754 map as a two block street running from the \\"High Road To Boston\\" (which later became Chatham St. and finally, Park Row), and ended at a small clearing where the later \\"bend\\" in the street would occur, which was at the time along the banks of the unnamed body of \\"fresh water\\" later known as the Collect Pond, with its marsh lying to the north. The future \\"Five Points\\" intersection was a normal crossing of two streets, Orange and Cross, with Cross Street running from Mott Street (as it always would), to an unmarked \\"Little Water Street\\", and then ending at the banks of the pond. Anthony Street (which would complete the \\"fifth point\\" and was later renamed Worth Street) did not exist. By 1797, the alignment north of the bend is shown, running all the way to Prince Street, but this section was called \\"Mary Street\\". A walkway had been built next to the street, along the pond and its marsh and running from the bend to almost Hester Street. In the new century, the street (the whole length by now renamed \\"Orange Street\\", and the areas to the west of it built up) was shown beginning in a dead end north of Prince Street. An 1803 plan, however, had it merge with Crosby Street at Houston Street. At Spring Street, Elm Street merged with Orange Street; and at Broome Street, Centre Street merged with Orange Street. The triangle formed by Broome, Orange, and Centre Streets was later the location of the original Centre Market. By 1850, the current alignment was set in place with Centre Market becoming a full block between Grand and Broome Streets, with the portions of the original street alignment north of Broome being connected only to Centre Street and renamed Marion Place (and is currently known as Cleveland Place, with Elm, now Lafayette St., taking the alignment north of there and extending past the original dead end). The street on the east side of the Market, which was displaced a bit east of where Orange ends at Grand, also had taken on the name Centre Market Place. On the southern end, Orange Street always ended at Chatham Street. Past there, another street, slightly to the east, named Roosevelt Street, continued to the East River waterfront. rookery near the Five Points intersection) is an illustration of the squalor of 19th century slums. Busy commercial street (ca 1890). Five Points The southern end of the street deteriorated into a slum, largely due to the infilling of the Collect Pond, which lowered property values, causing the middle class to move out, and poor immigrants and African Americans to move in.Anbinder The area, particularly the street, eventually became known for gang violence. In between, the first bowling alleys also were opened on the street, behind the saloons at Nos. 51 and 63,Anbinder, p.196 and the tap dance was created by competing black and Irish dancers at a tavern at 67 Orange. In 1854, to try to remove some of the stigma the area had taken on already, some of the primary streets were renamed,Anbinder, p.105 including Orange Street, which was then named after Charles Baxter, a state legislator who also to fought and died as a lieutenant colonel in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.Richman, Jeff (2012-07-15). \\"At Long Last\\". Green-Wood Historian Blog, Green-Wood Cemetery, 15 July 2012. Retrieved from http://www.green-wood.com/2012/at-long- last. Nonetheless, the area, and the street, would maintain its seedy reputation. Gangs included the Baxter Street Dudes, who ran the Grand Duke's Theatre from their headquarters on the street during the 1870s. When various artists and photographers (most notably, Jacob Riis) would capture the scenes of the Five Points intersection and the squalor of the area in the 1870s and '80s, many Baxter Street scenes, including such residences as the \\"Dens of Death\\" would be seen. Revitalization Later, much of the Five Points area was cleared. The east side, the Mulberry Bend, was turned into the Columbus Park in 1895. The west side of the street, and the entirety of Baxter Street south of Worth Street, was demolished for the Manhattan Civic Center in the 20th century. South of Canal Street, Baxter Street's west side adjoins the rear of the New York City Criminal Court, which is lined with numerous law and bail bond offices; Baxter Street is heavily connected to police and the law, despite having a history rife with crime. In popular culture The street's past was portrayed in a play by New York playwright Barbara Kahn, The Ballad of Baxter Street, which premiered in 2005 at Theater for the New City.\\"The Ballad of Baxter Street\\" In the backdoor pilot of the Arthur spinoff Postcards From Buster, Arthur and Buster notice the street sign while walking in Chinatown.

It is endemic to Brazil. It was formerly considered a subspecies of the black capuchin but is now considered by some to be a separate species. Taxonomy and phylogeny When the crested capuchin was discovered, it was formally classified as Cebus apella robustus and considered a subspecies of the tufted capuchin. In 2001, Groves proposed that the crested capuchin was a subspecies of the black capuchin and should be moved to Cebus nigritus robustus. In 2012, it was proposed that the genus Cebus should be split and that all robust capuchins should be under the genus Sapajus. Additionally, it was also argued that the crested capuchin is a separate species from the black capuchin, and therefore the new classification for the crested capuchin should be Sapajus robustus It has also been estimated using mitochondrial DNA that the crested capuchin diverged from the black capuchin over 5 million years ago, providing further evidence that the crested capuchin is a separate species from the black capuchin. However, Cebus nigritus robustus may still be used to refer to the crested capuchin. Characteristics The crested capuchin, unlike other species of capuchins, has a conical crest on the crown which is bright red with a black spot. This cone may also continue around the sides of the head to create a black beard. The rest of the fur may be brownish red or yellowish brown. The forearms, lower legs, and tail of the crested capuchin are all black, although these areas may be a mix of black and light yellow fur in females. Females also may have two lateral tufts on their crown that the males do not have. Crested capuchins have a head-body length of and a tail length of . The males are generally larger than the females of the species. They can weigh from . Distribution and habitat The crested capuchin formerly occurred between the Doce and Jequitinhonha rivers, in Esp√≠rito Santo, Minas Gerais and Bahia, on the Atlantic coast of Brazil. However, due to loss of habitat, their current range has been restricted in Bahia, eastern Minas Gerais, south of Rio Jequitinhonha and north of Rio Doce.Hill, W. (1960). Cebus Apella. In Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy. (Vol. IV: Cebidae Part A, pp. 483-485). Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. It generally frequents the mid-canopy to understory of tropical lowland and submontane forests, but may also live in semi-deciduous dry forests in the western part of their range . Ecology Grooming The species has a broad diet, including fruits, seeds, and arthropods, as well as frogs or even small mammals. They are very skilled at manipulating food items to reach the food they want. While no crested capuchins have been recorded using tools, it is very possible that they do. Other species of robust capuchins that have been studied more, such as Sapajus nigritus, have been documented using stones to open food items such as fruits with hard shells or oysters. Given the similarities between the two species and their ranges, crested capuchins may also use tools in this way. No observations have been done specifically on the crested capuchin, but they likely live in linear hierarchies that span both sexes, with the top-ranking male dominating the top-ranking female, similar to other closely related species of capuchin. Males ranked lower than the dominant male may also be a part of capuchin groups, but they often remain on the peripheral of the group. Conservation Crested capuchins were first classified as vulnerable in 1995 by the IUCN and became classified as endangered in 2008. Although their range includes several conservation areas, they occur only in a relatively small area, where they are under pressure from hunting and habitat destruction by conversion to agriculture.

Gameplay The game is set in a noir atmosphere aesthetically inspired by Belle Epoque and Art Nouveau. The player must solve puzzles that require movement between the physical world, which is represented as 3D, and shadows, which are represented as 2D. The player may sometimes manipulate different light sources in the 3D world (spotlights, film projectors, etc.) to create the shadow paths that reach into new areas; \\"collectibles\\", available through game-play, offer insight into the game's characters and the world in which they live. The goal of the game is exploration and discovery through problem solving. Dawn and Didi are the two characters who appear as full 3D figures. The player controls Dawn, an imaginary friend, who is able to manifest as a three-dimensional shadow. Dawn is able to jump between two shadows, no matter how far apart they are. Almost all other characters appear as shadows against the visual walls, but they still interact with the world as though they are \\"real.\\" Plot The game opens with Didi's invisible friend Dawn entering her room before Didi's mother puts her to bed before the mother leaves for the evening to sing at a local nightclub. Didi sneaks out of her house to watch her mother's performance, and ends up eavesdropping on her father meeting her mother, telling her mother about his newest plan to strike it rich, which is to open a circus. Didi's mother is not convinced, and leaves while the father tells her his hotel room number. The father then goes to meet with his headlining performer, the great Vincenzo, who is reluctant to perform without money up front, and refuses to lend a film reel of his performance to Didi's father, who wants to show it to his investors as a way to convince them to continue providing funding for the circus. Didi and Dawn steal the film reel, and follow the father to the cinema where he is soon confronted by mafia members, who start beating him when he claims the projector for the film is not working, and that he needs more cash to convince Vincenzo. Dawn and Didi start the film in the projector, which impresses the two mob members enough to continue their funding for the circus. Didi's father then goes to his hotel to wait for his estranged wife, who in the ensuing confrontation is vehement that she will not take the father back into the family until Didi intervenes, at which point she reluctantly allows the father to return to their home. Several days later, with the circus nearly ready to open, Didi and Dawn set out to meet Vincenzo, who in the previous confrontation between Didi's mother and father is revealed to be Didi's biological father. They overhear Vincenzo accosting Didi's father, pointing out how ill prepared the circus is, with several attractions either broken or missing actors. Dawn and Didi fix the circus acts, and then go to see Vincenzo in his workshop, where Vincenzo reveals that Didi was the result of an accidental pregnancy between him and Didi's mother, saying that he wasn't capable of caring for Didi with his work. Didi persists, saying that she's already shown herself to be capable of being his assistant after fixing the circus, but Vincenzo refuses, and after comforting a crying Didi, brings her back to her mother and father. His opening act is then started, but the light fixtures overload and the bulbs explode, leaving him unable to perform. Dawn and Didi then repair a lighthouse and use its light to allow Vincenzo to perform, whose act is a great success. Dawn and Didi then follow her parents backstage, and after Didi's father says that he is clearly incapable of providing after there were so many malfunctions in all of his schemes and that Vincenzo should take Didi in, Vincenzo and Didi's mother rebukes him, Vincenzo pointing out that he is clearly suited, having risked his life to be with Didi, whereas Vincenzo has not done nearly as much for her. The game ends with Didi's family formally reuniting, and Vincenzo offering to let Didi see his workshop again, remarking that even if he didn't bring Didi on his upcoming world tour, she'd probably still find a way on her own steam. The game closes with Vincenzo directly displaying the same power that Dawn has, physically appearing in the game's shadow world next to Dawn and Didi, and thanking Dawn for looking after Didi, and remarking to Dawn that \\"It's been a long time, hasn't it?\\" Through in game collectibles, it is revealed that Dawn and Vincenzo were originally a pair of illusionists from an alternate dimension, with Vincenzo building upon the work of Einstein to create his devices that allow him to manipulate reality. It is left unknown why Dawn has been left more permanently tied to this shadow world. Reception Contrast received mixed reviews upon its release. On Metacritic, the Xbox 360 version of the game got a score of 65/100, the PC computer version a 62/100, and the PlayStation 4 version a 59/100. On GameRankings, the game has a rating of 63%. Dan Stapleton of IGN gave the game a 7.5, praising the gameplay and the puzzles. He said, \\"Contrast is a game full of heart, beauty, and at least a few excellent puzzles.\\" Carolyn Petit of GameSpot gave the game a score of 5.0, complimenting the atmosphere of the game but criticizing the gameplay and the puzzles. VentureBeat's McKinley Noble gave Contrast a 55 out of 100 score, stating that while he liked the overall concept, it suffered from overly \\"glitchy\\" gameplay and \\"lifeless\\" environments.

It is a spin-off of the 1993 film Manichitrathazhu and an official remake of the 2007 Thai film Alone. Mohanlal reprises his role from Manichitrathazhu and Suresh Gopi appears in a cameo role. It also features Nishan, Keerthy Suresh, Swapna Menon, Siddique, Madhu, Innocent, and K. B. Ganesh Kumar. In the film, psychologist Dr. Sunny Joseph (Mohanlal) arrives at a mansion to treat Anjali (Keerthy), who is haunted by her deceased twin sister Geetha (Keerthy), and investigates the paranormal activities. The film was originally planned to be shot in 3D and Auro-3D formats but this was abandoned because the technology was time-consuming and only a few theatres in Kerala were equipped with Auro sound equipment at that time. Principal photography commenced on 6 July 2013 at Thiruvananthapuram and was completed in September. Most of the filming took place at the Chitranjali Studio and in and around Thiruvananthapuram. The cinematographer was Tirru and editing was done by T. S. Suresh. Geethaanjali was released worldwide on 14 November 2013. The film being an official remake of Alone was undisclosed before release, as a result, it was criticised as an imitation of Alone and its source material, the novel Elephants Can Remember, and other Indian films adapted from the film or novel. Mohanlal's performance, the cinematography and the graphics received praise. Plot It is believed that Anjali's (Keerthy Suresh) twin sister Geetha (Keerthy Suresh) has committed suicide. Anjali is betrothed to Anoop (Nishan), a member of a prominent family who works in Mumbai. When her mother falls from a terrace and is bedridden paralysed, Anjali and Anoop go to her house in Arackal, Kerala. Once there, Geetha's spirit begins to haunt Anjali, which disturbs her a lot. Within days, a series of horrifying incidents Occur. Anoop contacts Nakulan (Suresh Gopi); in order to reach Dr. Sunny Joseph (Mohanlal). Sunny eventually arrives from Machu Picchu to treat Anjali and to help her out of her crisis. Since everyone believes the house to be haunted, the family buys a new house. The future owner of the house Vasu (K. B. Ganesh Kumar) claims that he had seen Geetha in a car and wrote down the number on a file. He says that he could give it to them the next day, but he gets a phone call from Geetha's spirit asking him to meet her in the church next morning. He goes there and calls Sunny for help, but gets killed before Sunny could help him. Sunny then spots a car driving out of the church and follows it, but the killer already got out of the car before Sunny could spot him. Anjali tells Sunny that Geetha had committed Sucide after she learned that Anjali and Anoop loved each other. Sunny then seeks help from Kadalikkattu Thirumeni(Nassar) who too discovered that Anjali was possessed by Geetha's ghost. Gruesome events follow, including the death of Thambichayan (Siddique), a caretaker at Arakal. Sunny tells everyone that the ghost haunting Anjali is just a psychological effect and not real. For some reason, he tries to postpone the marriage, but in vain. Anoop assumes that Sunny is trying to separate Anjali from him, and thus Anoop drives Sunny out of the house. It is then that he sees the death of Thambichayan who was caught in a fire from a cottage. On their engagement day, Sunny grabs Anoop and shoves him into his car. He drives to a small graveyard and tells Anoop that the so-called Anjali is actually Geetha, who has criminal intentions. In a flashback, it is revealed that Anjali and Anoop fall in love with each other, but Geetha misunderstands that Anoop loved her and she loves him back. Geetha became angry that Anoop is going to marry Anjali and not her, and decided to take revenge on Anjali. Sunny then shows Anjali's grave to Anoop and tells him the whole truth about her. The feeling of guilt in her mind led her to see Anjali wherever she goes, and all the horrible incidents that happened were just illusions seen by Geetha. Vasu was actually killed by Thambi, the only person who knew the truth, apart from Geetha and her mother. It is also shown that it was Geetha who accidentally shoved her mother off the terrace, when she was told that Anjali's spirit was in the house. Thambi is later killed by Geetha so that there is no way anyone could unravel the truth. Sunny, still unsure, tried to postpone their marriage until he had collected enough evidence to reveal the truth. Hearing this, Anoop storms into the house and accused Geetha of taking Anjali's name. Geetha tries to kill Anoop when he says that he does not want her anymore. She finally revealed that it was she who killed Anjali during the argument in the beach (while she conveniently concocted a different version when Sunny had earlier asked about the beach incident. Anoop almost gets paralyzed by Geetha and is about to be killed. Fortunately, Sunny breaks into the house and rescues Anoop, but she takes a gun and aims at them. An image of Anjali's spirit appears in Geetha's mind (on a mirror) and prevents her from shooting Anoop. Geetha is killed by a fire in the house, and Anjali's \\"spirit\\" watches over Geetha while she is dying. Later, Geetha's grave is built alongside Anjali's, and Anoop, his family, and Thankappan (Innocent) thank Sunny for helping them.

Priyadarsan said Mohanlal wanted to revive Sunny and was looking for a suitable subject and storyline. He said, \\"I had been telling [Priyadarshan] that he should revive Sunny as I felt that he was a character with immense potential for a new film; someone who can fit into any background or period. In this movie, Sunny reappears, a little older, but no less wacky than in his previous outing.\\" The film is not an official sequel to Manichitrathazhu, but Mohanlal portrays the psychiatrist Dr. Sunny Joseph, the character he acted in Manichitrathazhu. About the genre, Priyadarshan described: \\"It is more of a thriller and a whodunit. To maintain the feel of the theme, there is no slapstick comedy or forced attempts at humor. At the same time, I have infused humour into some of the scenes to ease the tension\\". According to the director, Geethanjali is a psychological thriller set in a supposedly-haunted bungalow. Since the story has a Christian backdrop, he engaged screenwriter Dennis Joseph to help with the dialogue. Shobana, who played Ganga in Manichitrathazhu was to make a guest appearance to introduce Dr. Sunny as the psychiatrist who cured her. However, that plan did not worked out. Geethaanjali was an official remake of the 2007 Thai film Alone. = Casting = Mohanlal reprised the role of Dr. Sunny Joseph, the protagonist in Manichithrathazhu. The production team were looking for a heroine; they shortlisted a few people from the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Hindi film industries during pre-production in June 2012.

Her father Kumar is a family friend of Mohanlal and Priyadarshan. Nishan K. P. Nanaiah was cast as Anoop, the fianc√©e of the character acted by Keerthy Suresh. Actor Innocent made a comeback to films with Geethanjali after his cancer treatment, he agreed to act on the insistence of Priyadarshan and Mohanlal and allotted ten days for the shoot. K. B. Ganesh Kumar was also signed in a role. Although Innocent and Ganesh appeared in Manichitrathazhu, they portrayed two new characters in Geethaanjali. Swapna Menon was cast as the daughter of Thankappan (Innocent); her characterisation was similar to that of the female version of Chanthu (Sudheesh) in Manichithrathazhu. Late actor-director Cochin Haneefa's twin daughters Safa and Marwa played the childhood of Geetha and Anjali.\\"Cochin Haneefa's twins pose with Mohanlal\\". The Times of India. 12 November 2013. Retrieved 17 May 2014. They have no dialogue and are only seen in a song sequence. Suresh Gopi reprised his role as Nakulan in a cameo appearance. It was the first time Priyadarshan worked with veteran actors Madhu, Siddique, and Harisree Ashokan. = Filming = Chitranjali Studio in Trivandrum was a significant location Principal photography commenced on 6 July 2013 at Thiruvananthapuram. Priyadarshan began initial filming with two units‚Äîone at Kovalam and another on a set at the Pothencode palace. He tried to finish the shoot by 20 August, which left three weeks to complete post-production. The film was shot on locations in and around Thiruvananthapuram and Chitranjali Studio. Ninety percent of it was shot in Thiruvananthapuram and the remaining ten percent was shot in Dubai and New Delhi. In early September, Mohanlal announced he had completed shooting and had moved on to another film. The film's makers had initially planned to make the film in 3D format, but this was abandoned because of the cost of production and the technology was time-consuming and filming would take much longer than planned. Priyadarshan also intended to use the Auro sound format, but no theatre in Kerala was equipped with that technology at that time, so he abandoned that idea too. Tirru was the director of photography. The music for the film was provided by Vidyasagar and the film was edited by T. S. Suresh. Lalgudi N. Ilaiyaraja was in charge of the art department. Release Geethaanjali was awarded a U/A certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification. The film's theatrical release, which was earlier planned for October 2013, was postponed until 14 November because of a delay in graphics works. Geethanjali was released in over 300 theatres worldwide on 14 November 2013, including 90 theatres in Kerala, distribution was done by Seven Arts Release in India. PJ Entertainments bought the distribution rights for Europe; they released in the United Kingdom in 61 theatres, Austria, Finland, Germany, Sweden, and Italy. The release in Singapore was dlayed until 16 November; there it was distributed by Singapore Coliseum. The film also had a release in Japan. The television satellite rights were purchased by Asianet before release.  Reception  =Critical reaction= Veeyen of Nowrunning.com rated the film two stars out of five, and said, \\"Very rarely does the film rise above the conventions of a horror film that seem to be stuck on its back like a duct tape. No amount of incredible performances or stunning cinematography by Thiru can save 'Geethanjali' from collapsing into another cluttered film that bites the dust\\". He also said the story is similar to that of Chaarulatha (2012). Sify.com criticised the film's similarity to the 2007 Thai film Alone and its Kannada-Tamil bilingual remake film Chaarulatha (2012). Sify.com also said, \\"Even if you haven't watched the original, this film is badly written and is barely engaging\\". Paresh C. Palicha of Rediff.com awarded it two stars out of five stars; he said the story is borrowed from many sources including the Thai film Alone and its Indian adaptation Chaarulatha, and also noted a \\"striking\\" similarity to the 2007 Malayalam film Nadiya Kollappetta Rathri. Ajin Krishna of Filmibeat.com awarded two stars out of five, he appreciated Mohanlal's performance and the cinematography, he said, \\"Geethanjali fails to entertain and horrify, even by following the same path of the usual horror movies. Priyadarshan could have worked better on this movie, at least to do justice to the tagline of a horror movie.\\" Aswin J. Kumar of The Times of India gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, and stated, \\"Geethanjali plays around a script that is constantly unsteady, giving away hints far too quickly or getting immersed in trifles just for the purpose of stretching the narrative. Even without comparisons, the movie never attains the arresting enigma of a psychological narrative.\\" IndiaGlitz.com rated it four-and-a-half stars out of ten, and said it is a \\"rip-off\\" of Alone, Chaarulatha, and Nadiya Kollapetta Rathri; he said, \\"'Geethanjali' stands on a weak script, which scares and shocks in bits and spurts. The film rides on Mohanlal's brand value, but its writing plays the spoilsport.\\" however, the reviewer gave a special mention to the makeup and prosthetics. Raj Vikram of MetroMatinee.com gave a mixed review, saying, \\"The script of Abhilash Nair has loopholes dime a dozen but the directorial experience of Priyadarshan supported by some excellent camera work by Tirru and well crafted graphics do make the movie a watchable one\\", and, \\"As a standalone horror thriller 'Geethanjali' has its moments and Dr.Sunny's presence indeed may prove to be its backbone!\\". = Theatrical run = Geethanjaly was released in around 300 theatres worldwide on 14 November. Seven Arts Release distributed the film in India. The film collected on the opening day in Kerala; it grossed from Kerala and from other Indian states within four days of its release, totalling gross from four days in India. In the UK, Geethanjaly grossed ¬£14,403; considering the theatrical revenue, it was unsuccessful at the box office in its final run. In 2016, the film was dubbed into Tamil as Vennila Minnala, with the makers hoping to gain revenue from Keerthy Suresh's new- found popularity in the Tamil film industry.movie was flop = Alleged influences = Although it was an official remake of Alone it was kept under wrap. The screenplay of Geethaanjali was criticised for its similarity to the films Alone (2007), Chaarulatha (2012), and Nadiya Kollappetta Rathri (2007). Geethanjali was mentioned in an online article published by International Business Times in 2014 which described that the film was partially inspired by the detective novel Elephants Can Remember written by Agatha Christie. The Kannada-Tamil bilingual film Chaarulatha was released in 2012 as an official remake of the 2007 Thai film Alone. Both Alone and Nadiya Kollappetta Rathri, released in the same year, were loosely based on Elephants Can Remember, which was published in 1972. Soundtrack The film's soundtrack was composed by Vidyasagar, with lyrics written by O. N. V. Kurup. The tracks \\"Koodilla Kuyilamme\\" and \\"Pavizha Munthiri\\" were revisions of \\"Jaana Hai Tujhko\\" and \\"Maine Hawa Ke Paron\\" from Priyadarshan's 2008 Hindi film Mere Baap Pehle Aap. The original soundtrack album of the film was officially released at a function held at Dreams Hotel, Kochi, in November 2013.

ELT is often a core element of school improvement or turnaround efforts, such that other practices like teacher collaboration, data-driven instruction, and integrated enrichment can be more effectively implemented. ELT differs from associated efforts like after-school programs or expanded learning opportunities (ELOs) because ELT requires all students in a given school to attend the longer day and/or year, and the additional time becomes a dependent component of the school's educational practices and objectives.  History of the United States public school calendar  The traditional public school calendar in the United States is an average of 180, 6.5-hour days across the year. The school year often begins in late August or early September and ends by early or mid-June.Tammy Kolbe, University of Connecticut / Mark Partridge, Florida State University / Fran O'Reilly, , National Center on Time & Learning, 2008 This norm emerged over the latter half of the nineteenth century, and while the states are still responsible for defining their mandatory hours and days, the majority of states have adopted something close to the traditional calendar. A major catalyst for the development of the uniform school calendar was the creation of compulsory education. Before the American Civil War, publicly funded education existed; however, there was no requirement for children to attend school. Additionally these public schools had two distinct calendars: rural and urban. The rural calendar typically operated for at most six months of the year, with most school days taking place during the winter, giving credence to the belief that the current system is based on the agrarian calendar. On the other hand, the urban calendar was much longer, in some cases almost year- round, to correspond with the round-the-clock approach of the industrial sector During the decades between the American Civil War and World War I, compulsory education became more widespread, as the economic incentive for developing an educated workforce grew. Massachusetts began the movement when, in 1852, it required youths aged 8‚Äì14 to attend at least 12 weeks of school; the requirement had increased to 32 weeks by 1902. New York was another leader in the compulsory education movement, passing a law in 1874 requiring youths aged 8‚Äì14 to attend school for 14 weeks; over the next 50 years, the requirement slowly increased, settling at 180 days by 1921. In both Massachusetts and New York, the number of days represented a compromise between the shorter instructional year of rural schools and the year-round availability of school in urban areas. Since about 1920, the traditional school year has become a legal and cultural norm.  History  The argument for expanded learning time has been advanced on a national stage since the convention of compulsory education began to take hold. In 1894, U.S. Commissioner of Education William Torrey Harris published a report about the state of American public education in which he complained of the loss of time in urban school days from 193.1 to 191. > [T]he constant tendency [has been] toward a reduction of time. First, the > Saturday morning session was discontinued; then the summer vacations were > lengthened; the morning sessions were shortened; the afternoon sessions were > curtailed; new holidays were introduced; provisions were made for a single > session on stormy days, and for closing the schools to allow teachers ... to > attend teachers' institutes ... The boy of today must attend school 11.1 > years in order to receive as much instruction, quantitatively, as the boy of > fifty years ago received in 8 years ... It is scarcely necessary to look > further than this for the explanation for the greater amount of work > accomplished ... in the German and French than in the American schools ... = A Nation at Risk = Nearly one hundred years after Harris's report, the debate about the school calendar in America continued. On August 26, 1981, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education T.H. Bell created the National Commission on Excellence in response to the \\"public perception that something is seriously remiss in our educational system\\". In 1983, the Committee released its report A Nation at Risk which added to the growing consensus that the American school system was failing. The Committee highlighted four areas of findings: content, expectations, time, and teaching. In the section \\"Findings Regarding Time\\" the commission made three observations: > (1) compared to other nations, American students spend much less time on > school work; (2) time spent in the classroom and on homework is often used > ineffectively; and (3) schools are not doing enough to help students develop > either the study skills required to use time well or the willingness to > spend more time on school work. Specifically, the commission recommended that schools consider a 7-hour day and 200- to 220-day school year. In response to the report, states launched task forces, committees, and study groups to focus on the issue of the education system. Of the five recommendations from the report, learning time is the only recommendation where there has not been a significant change. Schools across the country largely still adhere to the traditional calendar. = Prisoners of Time = In the Education Council Act of 1991, President George H.W. Bush established the National Education Commission on Time and Learning, a nine-member commission charged with studying the impact of time on learninghttps://www.archives.gov/records- mgmt/rcs/schedules/departments/department-of- education/rg-0441/n1-441-94-004_sf115.pdf Three years later, in April 1994, the Commission published a report, Prisoners of Time, referencing Commissioner Harris's 1894 report and outlining inherent problems with the traditional school calendar The commission argued that education is a top priority for the United States, citing public opinion polls and the bipartisan support for the Goals 2000, Educate America Act, which introduced eight broad and ambitious goals to improve the education system. In the report, the Commission highlighted how the constraints on learning time present a hurdle to achieve the targets laid out in the Goals 2000 Act. It then presented eight recommendations to correct the \\"design flaw\\" of traditional school calendars: I. Reinvent Schools around Learning, not Time II. Fix the Design Flaw: Use Time in New and Better Ways III. Establish an Academic Day IV. Keep Schools Open Longer to Meet the Needs of Children and Communities V. Give Teachers the Time They Need VI. Invest in Technology VII. Develop Local Action Plans to Transform Schools VIII. Share the Responsibility Partly in response to this report, the National Conference of State Legislatures included expanding learning time as an issue at its national conference in 1998. At that event, 14 states indicated they were considering bills to lengthen the school day and/or year.http://www.wested.org/online_pubs/po-98-02.pdf Since that time, however, the calendar of 180 6.5-hour school days has remained the norm. = Role of charter schools in the ELT movement = While both district public schools and state policy on school time have been slow to move away from the conventional calendar, the one sector of public education that has moved away from the standard more readily has been charter schools. Charter schools are public schools that are granted autonomy from traditional school districts while being held accountable for student outcomes. Charter schools have broken from the conventional school calendar in large part because, in most cases, charter schools are legally authorized to set their own operating hours. They take advantage of such flexibility to have longer schools day and a longer school year. About sixty percent of all expanded-time schools nationwide are charter schools. = Massachusetts = In 1993, the landmark Massachusetts Education Reform Act (MERA) created the framework for unprecedented improvements in students' learning, teachers' professionalism, school management, and equity of funding. As a result of MERA, 54 distinct activities were initiated by the then Department of Education to implement the Act In 1995, the First Annual Implementation Report was released, which separated the 54 activities into five goals and evaluated their impact on education throughout the Commonwealth. In the analysis of the first goal‚Äîto establish new standards and programs for students that ensure high achievement‚Äîthe report concluded, \\"If schools are to meet the enormous demands of assisting students in meeting these new standards, it may become necessary to increase the amount of time that students spend directly involved in education.\\" The legislature then charged the Board of Education to form the Massachusetts Commission on Time and Learning with a mandate to develop \\"a plan to extend the time during which students attend school to reflect prevailing norms in advanced industrial countries and to address the educational needs of children in the Commonwealth.\\" Following the report, the state took steps forward to advance the potential for schools to break from the traditional school calendar. Like other states, Massachusetts authorized the establishment of charter schools. By allowing the formation of schools that were granted the autonomy to design themselves as they saw fit, the legislature opened the door to a new wave of public schools that were not beholden to certain fixed policies related to school staffing or design, including the schedule. When the first fifteen charter schools were approved by the Board of Education in 1995, almost all of them featured some form of a longer school day and/or year. Expanded time did not become a cohesive strategy, however, until 2005 when the legislature included funds for planning grants in the FY 2006 budget ($500,000), which allowed 20 districts to plan how they might use a state grant to expand their school calendar by 25 percent. A year later, the legislature introduced a new line-item in the state budget which allocated $6.5 million to participating schools at a rate of $1,300 per student to fund an expanded school day and/or year. So began the Massachusetts Expanded Learning Time Initiative, the country's first competitive grant program established for the express purpose of expanding learning time in traditional district schools. Over the next few years, the MA ELT Initiative added a number of schools. In the 2012‚Äì2013 school year, 19 schools across ten districts added 300 hours to their school year through the ELT Initiative. No other state had attempted a similar grant program until January 2013 when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed that his state implement a grant program modeled on the one in Massachusetts, which was passed by the Legislature in their 2013‚Äì2014 fiscal year budget in March 2013. = The TIME Act = The Massachusetts ELT Initiative also caught the eye of policymakers in Congress. In 2007, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate called the Time for Innovation Matters in Education Act (TIME Act). This bill proposed to create a federal competitive grant program akin to the one that had already been in place in Massachusetts. A similar bill was reintroduced in 2009 by Senator Kennedy and then again in April 2011 by Senators Tom Harkin (D-IA), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Sherrod Brown(D-OH), Al Franken (D-MN), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) with a House Bill introduced by Representatives Mike Honda (D-CA) and Steve Chabot (R-OH). = President Obama's administration = Both President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan support redesigning the school calendar to increase learning time. As President Obama noted in an address in March 2009: > We can no longer afford an academic calendar designed for when America was a > nation of farmers who needed their children at home plowing the land at the > end of each day. That calendar may have once made sense, but today it puts > us at a competitive disadvantage. Our children -- listen to this -- our > children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea -- > every year. That's no way to prepare them for a 21st century economy. That's > why I'm calling for us ... to rethink the school day to incorporate more > time -‚Äì whether during the summer or through expanded-day programs for > children who need it. The administration has supported this agenda with additional funding. On February 17, 2009 President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/executive-summary.pdf Included in the Act was $3.5 billion for the School Improvement Fund, a program within the United States Department of Education that aims to \\"turn around\\" chronically low-performing schools. (This amount was in addition to $500 million that had been allocated to the Fund through regular budget appropriations.) By outlining the guidelines for the School Improvement program, the Department explicitly named \\"increased learning time\\" as one of the key reforms schools must undertake in two of the models, 'transformation' and 'turnaround'. (Schools must also make large-scale staffing changes and implement robust tutoring and data systems.) This School Improvement Grant (SIG) program provided grants to a total of about 1,600 schools since 2010.) = Other local and state initiatives =  Arizona  Arizona is the first and only state in the nation to incentivize an increase in the number of instructional days for school districts from the minimum required 180 days to 200. The state offers an increase of the base level funding by five percent for school districts that do choose to add 20 days to their school year. Since the creation of the incentive, three districts in Arizona have implemented the 200-day school year, Balsz, Riverside, and Nadaberg School Districts. Balsz School District has been implementing the longer school year for over three years and has experienced an increase in student achievement.https://esb.peoriaud.k12.az.us/attachments/f98a906e-0ee9-4763-9d28-711f5e872c11.pdf To build on that success, Arizona State Representative Paul Boyer (R-Phoenix) introduced HB 2488 in 2013. The bill called for increasing the additional funding to eight percent of a school's base level and would allow individual schools, including charter schools, to apply for funding in addition to whole school districts.  Chicago  In his campaign for mayor in spring 2011, Rahm Emanuel advocated for longer school days across the city. As he transitioned into the mayor's office after his election, Emanuel began to plan for how to increase the amount of time students are in school. After negotiations with the Chicago Teachers Union, the elementary school day was expanded from a 5.75-hour day to a 7-hour day. Although he campaigned originally for 7.5-hour day, Mayor Emanuel said, \\"The goal was not the time. The goal was the educational opportunity and the quality that went with it ... I would hope now that we'd stop debating about the time and start having a real discussion.\\" In September 2012, Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the third largest school district in the United States, with over 400,000 students and 675 schools, expanded learning time for all of its schools through its Full School Day Initiative. As part of the agreement with the Chicago Teachers Union, the district added 477 new teaching positions and added $130 million in funding to give principals and school communities flexibility to structure the new school day. While Full School Days are implemented differently at each school, with the additional time schools can provide the equivalent of an additional class period in math and English four days a week along with an additional enrichment or recovery options to ensure every student receives and education that will help them succeed. For elementary schools the average day now includes: * 20 additional minutes in reading * 30 additional minutes in intervention with adaptive technology * 15 additional minutes in math * 10 additional minutes in enrichment * 25 minutes of recess (previously students did not have time for recess)  The TIME Collaborative  The Ford Foundation and the National Center on Time & Learning (NCTL) joined to launch the TIME Collaborative on December 3, 2012 in Washington, D.C. Through the collaborative, select public schools in Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Tennessee will significantly expand and redesign their school calendars. The states will use a mix of federal and state funding to cover the cost of adding 300 hours of instruction and enrichment to the school year, and will receive technical assistance from NCTL and capacity building grants from the Ford Foundation.  Current ELT schools  In December 2011, NCTL released a report Mapping the Field: A Report on Expanded-Time Schools in America that identified 1,002 expanded-time schools, serving 520,000 students in 36 states in the U.S. as of the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. To identify these schools, NCTL used set criteria from its expanded-time schools database, the only database of its kind. Schools included in its database must have a 7-hour school day and must add 30 minutes and/or 10 days more than surrounding public schools or the school's pre-conversion schedule. Since the reporting and release of that report, Chicago Public Schools have undertaken their Full School Days Initiative. Across the 600 schools in Chicago, over 340,000 students have an expanded school day.  Research on ELT  Both research and practice indicate that adding time to the school schedule can have a meaningfully positive impact on student achievement. Many researchers have studied the impact of time on learning and their research underscores a central point: that while more time in schools is valuable, time is a resource that must be used well to realize its full potential. The evidence that quantity of learning time is a key modulator of student performance is available using three units of analysis: individual student, school, and system. On the individual level, one set of researchers investigating classrooms in California in the 1970s found that differences in the amount of engaged learning time among students accounted for nine percent of differences in student outcomes in elementary grades, a strong association in the field of education.Charles Fisher and David Berliner, Teaching and Learning in the Elementary School: A Summary of the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study (San Francisco, CA: Far West Lab for Educational Research and Development, 1978. Later, a series of experiments by one researcher determined a direct correlation between students' time spent studying a passage and their proficiency on a fact-based assessment, finding that the more time students spent studying the passage, the greater their performance in both the near term and after one week.Maribeth Gettinger, \\"Individual Differences in Time Needed for Learning,\\" Educational Psychologist, 1984, 19(1), 15-29; Gettinger, \\"Time Allocated and Time Spent Relative to Time Needed for Learning as Determinants of Achievement,\\" Journal of Educational Psychology, 1985, 77(1), 3-11; and Gettinger, \\"Effects of Maximizing Time Spent and Minimizing Time Needed for Learning on Pupil Achievement,\\" American Educational Research Journal, 1989, 26(1), 73-91. An analysis of test scores in Illinois has validated that the more time individual students spent in reading and math class, the higher their scores in those subjects.Dennis Coates, \\"Education Production Functions Using Instructional Time as an Input,\\" Education Economics, 11:3 (Dec 2003), pp. 273-292 Among studies that have analyzed factors that contribute to differentials in student performance at the school level, learning time also emerges as one of the main correlates. One of the most pointed studies on this correlation is from a study of charter schools in New York City, which determined that quantity of instructional time (along with high-dosage tutoring, frequent feedback to teachers, and a culture of high expectations) account for up to 50 percent of the variation in outcomes among schools.Dobbie and Roland G. Fryer, Jr, \\"Getting Beneath the Veil of Effective Schools: Evidence from New York City,\\" NBER Working Paper, No. 17632, December 2011. A second study of charter schools in New York City found that a longer year was one of the strongest associations with higher student achievement.Caroline Hoxby and Sonali Murarka, \\"New York City Charter Schools: How Well are They Teaching Their Students?,\\" Education Next, Summer 2008: 54-61. On the system level, several studies have examined whether changes to instructional time have any effect on academic outcomes. An analysis of Maryland school over several years looked at the effect of snow days on test scores ‚Äîin particular, lost school days due to inclement weather in school in the weeks leading up to the administration of state assessments‚Äîrevealed that in those years when there were fewer snow days students performed better than in those years that had more than five snow days. A study of schools in Israel found that an increase in instructional time from one year to the next‚Äîthe result of a re-financing plan that provided schools more resources‚Äî\\"positively impacts\\" test scores in English, science, and math tests, with some variation by subject and student socioeconomic status.Victor Lavy, \\"Expanding School Resources and Increasing Time on Task: Effects of a Policy Experiment in Israel on Student Academic Achievement and Behavior,\\" NBER Working Paper, No. 18369, September 2012. In both these cases, then, adding more time to an otherwise fixed system equates with more learning. As for studies that considered the effects of adding time to schools for the express purpose of improving educational outcomes, a meta-analysis examined 15 empirical studies of extended school days and/or years and found that adding time was, more often than not, associated with improved student outcomes, noting stronger effects for schools serving large populations of at-risk students. The authors of this research point out that quantity of time cannot be considered an independent variable, however, because the ways in which the time is used by educators and students is what actually matters for learning. > It is only common sense that if additional school time is not used for > instructional activities or if additional instruction is poor in quality, it > is unlikely to lead to achievement gains. ... Going further, we would > suggest that instructional practices can be viewed as mediators of extended > school time effects on students. That is, the effectiveness of instruction > might determine whether extended school time has positive, negative, or no > effects on student outcomes. The National Center on Time & Learning has conducted research in high- performing expanded-time schools to better understand how time can be used in ways that promote strong student achievement. In its publication, Time Well Spent, NCTL identifies eight categories of practices: (a) making every minute count, (b) prioritizing time, (c) individualizing learning time, (d) building school culture, (e) incorporating a well-rounded education, (f) integrating program elements that focus on college and career success, (g) enabling productive teacher collaboration, and (h) assessing, analyzing and responding to data. Authors describe \\"dynamic synergies\\" among these practices that together help to ensure a productive use of school time.  Organizations calling for ELT  America's Promise is a national partnership founded by Colin Powell in 1997 to help children from all socioeconomic sectors to have access to five promises in the United States. One of America's Promises five focus areas is an effective education. Through Grad Nation, America's Promise supports communities as they raise graduation rates, including through expanding learning time and opportunities. The Ford Foundation is an independent, global philanthropic institution, committed to developing innovative leaders of social change. As part of its Education Opportunity and Scholarship Program in the U.S., the Foundation is a leader in providing support to initiatives that provide more and better learning time for students in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.http://www.fordfoundation.org/issues/educational-opportunity-and- scholarship/more-and-better-learning-time Children At Risk is a non-profit organization in Texas that drives change for children through research, education, and influencing public policy. One of its key legislative priorities in education is expanded learning time. Citizen Schools is a national nonprofit organization that partners with middle schools to expand the learning day for low-income children across the country. The organization's programs blend these real-world learning projects with rigorous academic and leadership development activities, preparing students in the middle grades for success in high school, college, the workforce, and civic life. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is a civil rights organization formed in 1909 with a mission to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons. The NAACP included expanded learning time as one of the four focus points to increase education equality in their 2012 report \\"Finding Our Way Back to First: Reclaiming World Leadership by Educating All America's Children.\\"http://naacp.3cdn.net/b405f72ea227a97b84_mlbrus9il.pdf The National Center on Time & Learning (NCTL), a non-profit 501 (c)(3) organization, is dedicated to expanding learning time to improve student achievement and enable a well-rounded education. Through research, public policy and technical assistance, NCTL supports national, state and local initiatives that add significantly more school time for academic and enrichment opportunities to help children meet the demands of the 21st century. The After-School Corporation (TASC) is a nonprofit intermediary organization founded in 1998. TASC demonstrates models for school re-invention, builds the capacity of schools and community partners to implement at scale, and advocates for sustainable expanded learning in New York and the nation. TASC leads the ExpandED Schools Network, with schools in Baltimore, New Orleans, and New York City. Time to Succeed Coalition (TSC), launched in May 2012 by the National Center on Time & Learning and the Ford Foundation, is a diverse coalition, bringing educators, parents, community leaders and civic officials together with CEOs, policymakers, and leading thought leaders to inspire and motivate communities across the country to add more learning time as part of a redesigned school day and year, enabling children to get the education they need to succeed. The Wallace Foundation is a national philanthropy that seeks to improve education and enrichment for disadvantaged children. One of its five major initiatives includes supporting school district and other efforts to expand learning time during summer and the regular school day or year.  Why most Schools, districts, and states have not ELT  Controversy over educational budgets and spending has led to much of the debate over ELT. Most cost estimates account for paying teachers and administrators for extending contract hours, but many of the other costs involved in public education have not even been added to current proposed budgets for ELT. \\"The recent proposal by Minnesota school superintendents to extend the school year by 25 days (from 175 to 200) was estimated to cost $750 million dollars, which the superintendents determined was not feasible, either financially or politically.\\" With most states currently operating in the red, adding educational budgetary spending is unlikely to occur. \\"America spends over $500 billion a year on public elementary and secondary education in the United States. On average, school districts spend $10,314 for each individual student.\\" For the fiscal year 2010, State and local funding accounted for 87% of total funding in the U.S.School Finance: Federal, State, and Local k-12 School Finance Overview; Federal Education Budget Project. The focus of reform-minded politicians has been unilateral; Increase the output of citizens' economic potential in order to keep up with the rest of the world. What is forgot while new legislature is forged are the many other goals families and communities have for their children. Developing respect for each other, responsibility, economic sustainability, cultural diversity, equality, and happiness are just a few of the many goals Americans have for their children in schools. Larry Cuban, a professor emeritus of education at Stanford University argues that, \\"policy makers and reform-minded civic and business elites have not only defined economic problems as educational ones that can be fixed by more time spent in schools but also neglected the powerful hold socialization goals have on parents' and taxpayers' expectations.\\" There are other educational reform options for improving the U.S. educational system that do not cost more money and still allow for local control. Much of the current school day is spent on activities other than instruction. As stated in Improving student achievement by extending school: Is it just a matter of time?, by Aronson, Simmerman, & Carols, (1998) \\"A review of the research literature on how time is divided up during the school day shows that a large portion of the potential learning time is typically eaten up by non-instructional activities, which have little relationship to student learning.\\" Districts and schools are brainstorming ways to reallocate time more effectively. Current staff development opportunities are focusing on time on task, a term associated with the amount of time students actually spend in engaged learning activities. Parents and communities members are partnering with local districts and schools to provide educational opportunities that engage students by individualizing instruction, yet still focus on the state and local curriculum. More focused curricular goals, such as the Common Core State Standards, have been implemented to help focus learning activities.

The battalion spent 339 days in the treacherous Belgian trenches, 164 of which involved front line duty. They fought in the Actions of St. Eloi Craters (27 March ‚Äì 16 April 1916), at Hill 62, Mount Sorrel and Sanctuary Wood. These battles marked the first occasion in which Canadian divisions engaged in planned offensive operations during World War I. In those actions the Canadians reconquered vital high-ground positions that denied the Germans a commanding view of the town of Ypres itself. Of the 1000 men that started with the battalion, after the first year of fighting 900 men were killed, taken prisoner, missing or injured. (See the Hill 62 Memorial).

The objective of the Canadian Corps was to take control of the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The town of Th√©lus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient of considerable German resistance.

Ahram Online. 2011-04-06. was an Egyptian politician and activist. He is the founder of the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party,Moustafa, 2007, p. 103. serving as its secretary-general between 1992 and November 2010. Early life and law career Dawoud was born and raised in the rural Nile Delta village of al-Roda in the Damietta region. At the time, many of al-Roda's inhabitants were impoverished, although Dawoud's family lived in relatively better conditions, owning about 100 feddans of land. Most of the village's lands were owned by Mohammed Abdel Halim Halim, a Turkey-based relative of then-King Farouk. Dawoud grew up resenting what he saw as the exploitation of al-Roda's inhabitants by the royal aristocracy and the poor conditions of his village. In an interview with Al Ahram Weekly, Dawoud claimed he was the only person from al-Roda who attended university in the 1940s. He spent his first year, 1946, studying at the Alexandria University's Faculty of Law, before being admitted to King Fuad University in Cairo in 1947. He graduated with a law degree in 1950. He briefly joined the Muslim Brotherhood during his time at King Fuad University, but left shortly after due to his disillusionment with what he called \\"absolutist religious thinking.\\" During his university years, Dawoud took an interest in socialism and political activism, joining the National Party headed by Abd al-Rahman al-Rafai in 1946. That year, students from Alexandria University's law school staged a protest against the British military presence in Alexandria prompting the Egyptian security forces to quell the demonstration, killing two of Dawoud's classmates. The British military barracks was then attacked by students the following day, resulting in the closure the university until October. Dawoud began his law practice working for a firm in Faraskur, a city near his hometown. He continued his law practice in the Damietta area after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, when the Free Officers Movement overthrew the monarchy of King Farouk. Dawoud welcomed the revolution and left the National Party, viewing the party system itself as \\"politically bankrupt and lack[ing] solutions to help the country escape the continued political and socio-economic crisis.\\" When the Free Officers, who governed through the Revolutionary Command Council, established a single-party system in 1953 with the Liberation Rally being the only legal political movement of the state, Dawoud joined it. The National Union replaced the Liberation Rally in 1956. Political career =Minister and party cadre= In 1962, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) was inaugurated as the new ruling party. Two years later, Dawoud ended his law career, became a local party official in the Damietta Governorate's ASU chapter and a member of its local council. Also in 1964, he entered his candidacy in the parliamentary elections, winning the Faraskur seat. Afterward, President Gamal Abdel Nasser appointed him as the Executive Bureau Secretary of the ASU in Damietta. Dawoud was elected to the eight-member Supreme Executive Committee of the ASU in party elections in 1968,Ansari, 1986, pp. 137-138. receiving 104 votes, falling behind Anwar Sadat, Mahmoud Fawzi, Hussein el-Shafei and Ali Sabri.Farid, 1996, p. 97. He was affiliated with Sabri's left-leaning faction, and his election to the ASU was seen by observers as strengthening the position of Sabri,Ansari, 1986, p. 145. who gained the highest votes within the party. Dawoud was consequently made Social Affairs Minister in Prime Minister Nasser's cabinet;Smucker, Phillip. 50 years after his coup, legacy of Nasser lives on. The Telegraph. 2002-07-23. Nasser had taken the additional role of Prime Minister in 1967. =Conflict with Sadat= In a private meeting with Vice President and Speaker of Parliament Sadat, Al-Ahram editor-in-chief, Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, and ASU Press Secretary Khaled Mohieddin during the 1968 ASU Congress, Dawoud entered into an argument with Sadat, accusing him of \\"corrupting Egypt's parliamentary life\\". Heikal informed Nasser of Dawoud's concerns, which Nasser shared. Nasser appointed Labib Shukair as speaker later that year. Following Nasser's death in September 1970, Sadat succeeded him as president. Sadat faced opposition from Dawoud and the members of Sabri's camp, who favored a form of collective leadership to fill the political vacuum left by Nasser. Tensions between the two sides were initially eased when Sadat announced his preference for collective leadership during his inaugural speech.Ansari, 1986, p. 153. Conflict between the pro and anti-Sadat factions resumed in April 1971, when members of the Supreme Executive Committee voted 5 to 3 against Sadat's agreement to form a federation with Libya and Syria, with Dawoud being one of the opposing votes. During that meeting Dawoud also called on Sadat to resign from the presidency.Egyptian Coup was Slated for Sunday. Star News. Originally published by UPI. 1971-05-17. In disapproval of Sadat's policies, which they viewed as running counter to the goals of the 1952 Egyptian Revolution and Nasser's legacy, members of the pro-Sabri faction, including Dawoud, announced their resignation on 13 May.Dekmeijan, 1975, pp. 221-222. Later that month, Sadat announced that members of the pro-Sabri faction were orchestrating a coup to topple him and ordered the arrests of Sabri and his allies, including Dawoud. In September, Dawoud was brought to trial along with 91 other ASU officials. Dawud was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, while Sabri was given a death sentence, which was commuted by Sadat to a life sentence.Nyrop, 1976, p. 48. The arrest and imprisonment of prominent ASU members was seen as a purge by Sadat, not necessarily of Nasserists, but of powerful members of the party leadership opposed to his rule. The purge was part of a broader monopolization of power by Sadat known as the \\"Corrective Movement\\".Ansari, 1986, p. 166. =The Nasserist Party and the Mubarak era= In 1987, during a period of limited political d√©tente offered by President Hosni Mubarak (r. 1981-2011), Nasserist opponents of Sadat from the ASU (it was dissolved in 1978), including Dawoud who had been released from prison by that time, founded the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party. Dawoud was chosen as the party's chief representative.Bernard-Maugiron, 2008, p. 220. The party modeled itself as the upholder of Nasser's legacy, calling for state-led economic growth, rejection of Zionism and American imperialism and closer inter-Arab ties.Stacher, Joshua A. Parties Over: The Demise of Egypt‚Äôs Opposition Parties . British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies. 31:2. Carfax Publishing. November 2004. When Dawoud's reentry into politics was opposed by Mubarak's administration due to his 1971 conviction, Dawoud launched an appeal to the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) challenging that particular provision law. Dawoud succeeded in arguing that the provision law ran counter to articles 66 and 187 of the constitution because it was a form of retroactive punishment and barred a person's political rights. The SCC nullified the provision.Moustafa, 1996, pp. 103-104. However, when the ADNP sought to be legalized as a party, their application was rejected by the Committee for Parties on account of the ADNP's rejection of the Camp David Peace Treaty with Israel. This prompted Dawoud to appeal to the Court of Parties. The case remained in deadlock until 1988 when the SCC ruled the ADNP to be legal, despite government objections.Bernard-Maugiron, 2008, p. 92. Dawud remained as secretary-general, but the party was not officially proclaimed until 1992.Podeh, 2004, p. 109. Dawoud's legal victories opened the door for numerous other opposition activists to press for further rights in the courts. In the 1995 and 2000 People's Assembly elections, the ADNP was the only party that was legalized after 1990 (there were a total of ten) to win any seats. In 1995 the party won two seats and in 2000, three seats. However, the party failed to win any seats in the 2005 and 2010 elections amid internal divisions, low sources of funding and government financial pressure and harassment.Nasserist Party moves to quash discord rumors. 2010-03-29. Between 2007 and 2008, tensions developed between Dawoud and party cadre Sameh Ashour, when the latter tried to oust Dawoud from his role as secretary-general.Ottawi and Hamzawi, 2012, p. 52. Dawoud stepped down from the party leadership in November 2010, citing health reasons. Although he delegated Ashour to serve as the party's leader, Dawoud was succeeded by Amhed Hassan, creating further rifts within the ADNP.

Formed in late July 1941, the army fought in the Battle of Smolensk (1941). It was forced to retreat after German troops broke through in October 1941 and subsequently fought in the Battle of Moscow. The army then fought in the Rzhev-Vyazma Offensive. After the end of the offensive, the army held its positions and transferred to the Demidov area in late 1942. It fought in the Battle of Smolensk (1943). During the summer of 1944 the army fought in Operation Bagration. In the fall the army advanced into the Baltic region and fought in the Riga Offensive (1944) and the Battle of Memel. In 1945 the army fought in the East Prussian Offensive before being placed in reserve near the end of April. The 43rd Army was disbanded postwar in July 1946.  History  = Battles of Smolensk and Moscow = The 43rd Army was formed on 31 July 1941 in accordance with a Stavka order dated 30 July 1941. The army was formed from the 33rd Rifle Corps and was part of the Reserve Front. It was commanded by Lieutenant General Ivan Zakharkin. By 10 August, it included the following units.Appendix No. 2 to the Directive of the General Staff No. D-043, 1970 * 38th Rifle Division * 53rd Rifle Division * 145th Rifle Division * 149th Rifle Division * 211th Rifle Division * 217th Rifle Division * 222nd Rifle Division * 279th Rifle Division * 303rd Rifle Division * 104th Tank Division * 109th Tank Division From its formation the army defended the Desna River south of Yelnya on the line of Kholmets and Bogdanovo, fighting in the Battle of Smolensk.

In the game, players control up to four archers in a multiplayer platform fighter. It was released on the Ouya microconsole in June 2013 and was later ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Linux, OS X, and Windows as TowerFall Ascension. TowerFall was Thorson's first commercial game. It followed from a June 2012 game jam single-player prototype. Thorson tested the game on their indie developer colleagues with whom they lived, and developed its capacity as a party game. Its mechanics were inspired by games of Thorson's youth, such as Bushido Blade and GoldenEye 007, and influenced by demo feedback at the Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament. TowerFall was known as the standout title for the Ouya at the console's launch. In its first year, the game sold around 7,000 copies on Ouya, resulting in a gross revenue of about $105,000. When the Ouya exclusivity expired, Thorson signed another exclusivity agreement for the PlayStation 4, where Ascension received an expanded single-player mode, and new levels, weapons, and gameplay variants. A PlayStation Vita release followed in 2015, and Xbox One and Switch versions have been released as well. A standalone eight-player edition for Windows released in 2016. Ascension was met with generally favorable reception. Critics recommended it as a party game favorable to Super Smash Bros. and praised its balance. However, some felt that its single-player mode was a low point, and lamented the lack of an online multiplayer mode.  Gameplay  Typical combat between three players TowerFall is an archery combat arena game where players kill each other with arrows and head-stomps until only one player remains. (Though you also can play on Co-op mode), In multiplayer, up to four players fight in an arena using a limited supply of arrows. Players replenish their arrow supply from those shot about the arena. The players can also catch other players' arrows. \\"Treasure\\" power-ups give players shields, wings, and arrows with increased power. The game's rules can be customized and saved for future use. Kotakus Chris Person described the gameplay as \\"[Super] Smash Bros. bred with games like Spelunky or Nidhogg\\". There are four game modes. In single-player, the player must hit targets around the arena before a timer runs out. The developer compared this mode to \\"Break the Targets\\" in the Super Smash Bros. series. Ascension adds a remodeled version of the target levels as a Trials mode, which requires the players to use power-ups to break all targets within several seconds. Ascension also adds a Quest mode, where one or two players attempt to survive against enemy waves of increasing difficulty. As a single- player event, Quest functions as a score attack mode. The new Ascension improvements were also released for the Ouya version. The Ouya release supports the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 controllers. Ascension uses the DualShock 4 controller's built-in speaker to play sound effects. The game does not have online multiplayer.  Development  The game was developed and produced by Maddy Thorson, who previously made Planet Punch and browser games. TowerFall was their first full commercial game. The idea came from a visit with Alec Holowka as they worked at a game jam, the 48-hour June 2012 Vancouver Full Indie Game Jam. The team iterated through a Legend of Zelda- inspired multiplayer mode that became a single-player platformer Flash game where the player was a \\"skilled archer out of an ancient legend\\". They intended to add multiple weapons, but chose to keep their first one‚Äîthe bow and arrow‚Äîdue to its feel. The arrow was designed to fire without charging and to bias towards targets so as to give the player \\"more leeway\\". Thorson also chose to limit the aim direction to the eight ordinal directions rather than affording complex 360 degree controls. They also added levels, items, a store, and a story based on ascending a tower. Along with in-game progress, players would gain new items and skills. Thorson originally intended to send the game to Adult Swim for \\"easy money\\", but changed their mind upon developing a multiplayer version after the jam. Holowka credits the multiplayer's party game feel to the many hours of local multiplayer testing it received in Thorson's homes in Vancouver. Thorson lived with a developer they met through Game Maker's community and the two eventually moved in with Holowka in \\"Indie House\\", a Vancouver house whose occupants are all indie developers. The close community of indie gamers and their interest in trying new game ideas was both a product and generator of their living arrangements. Though Holowka dropped back from the project shortly after the game jam, leaving the project to Thorson, he stepped in to demo the game at the 2013 Game Developers Conference at the last minute when Thorson's passport was expired. With an increase in press attention following an exhibition at PAX East, Thorson entered an agreement with Ouya's Kellee Santiago to release exclusively on the microconsole. Critics saw this as being the action the new console needed to compete with existing consoles, and Thorson felt the release for Ouya to be less \\"intimidating\\" than if for the PlayStation 3. The game also fit Ouya's emphasis on couch co-op gaming. Thorson originally did the artwork themself but was not satisfied with the results and hired MiniBoss to finish the graphics. Holowka composed the music, and Thorson hired Power Up Audio to make the sound effects. Thorson said that the game started to come together about six months into its development. They tested the game on close friends once every few weeks, and the friends would ask Thorson when they could play it again. Thorson brought the game to the 2013 Evolution Championship Series fighting games tournament, where they unexpectedly received more praise than criticism. The game mechanics were inspired by games from Thorson's youth. Upon reflection, they felt that the game had the item-catching mechanics of Super Smash Bros., the one-hit kills and tension of Bushido Blade, the playfulness of Goldeneye 007, the shooting mechanics of Yoshi's Island, and the positioning strategy of Team Fortress 2. They described their development process as tweaking Super Smash Bros. Melee to their tastes. The limited arrow design was intended to slow the gameplay and encourage player strategy. They considered adding online multiplayer, a popular request, but lacked the programming skills themself. The game's medieval scenery came from their contemporary interest in the Game of Thrones book series and their pairing of the arrow mechanic with \\"stone-walled castles and lava-filled dungeons\\". The player-characters also have individual personalities and backstories that Thorson intended to elaborate in a \\"lore\\" section of an instruction manual.  Release  TowerFall was released June 25, 2013 as an Ouya exclusive. The game sold well, minding the Ouya's newness, which allowed Thorson to develop the game into a fuller package. Thorson stated their plans to extend the single- player, and signed a new exclusivity agreement to release TowerFall Ascension on PlayStation 4 and Steam with new levels, weapons, and gameplay variants after the Ouya exclusivity agreement ended six months later. Sony actively pursued the game, and a majority of the porting work was handled by Dallas- based Sickhead Games by two people over the course of eight weeks using MonoGame, \\"an open-source rewrite\\" of Microsoft XNA. Thorson thought that the DualShock 4's directional pad was \\"perfect for TowerFall and that the PlayStation 4 was \\"the natural next step\\" for the game. They received a letter from George Broussard before Ascension launch with pre-congratulations on Thorson's becoming a millionaire. The main additions to Ascension were its single-player and cooperative gameplay modes. A level editor is planned for a future update, and Thorson has expressed interest in six controller support for three-on-three matches. Ports for Linux and OS X platforms were released on May 29, 2014, with updated game variants. TowerFall was selected for the July 2014 Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament's Indie Showcase, and as a free game with PlayStation Plus for the same month. Towerfall: Ascension was eventually released as a sequel to the original Towerfall for the OUYA console in November 2016. = Updates = In February 2015 a \\"Blue Archer\\" was revealed as a new playable character for the expansion \\"Dark World\\", developers stated her appearance was based on that of Anita Sarkeesian.\\"Alternate Archers\\" on the TowerFall Tumblr posted February 9, 2015: Next up is the alternate blue archer. If you keep up on gaming news she may seem familiar - her appearance is loosely based on feminist games critic Anita Sarkeesian. An expansion pack, Dark World, was released in North America on May 12, 2015, for the PlayStation 4 and PC (Linux, OS X, and Windows) via Steam, the Humble Store, and GOG.com. The European PlayStation released followed several days later. The pack includes a four-player multiplayer campaign mode where players fight boss battles together and can resuscitate each other. It also adds a power-up that makes arrows explode by remote- detonation. The pack began as a set of new levels and became four sets, ten new characters, procedurally generated levels, and the aforementioned power- up, co-op, and boss battles. A PlayStation Vita version was released on December 15, 2015. An Xbox One version, including both Ascension and Dark World, was released on January 18, 2018. A Nintendo Switch version was released on September 27, 2018, and includes Madeline and \\"Part of Her\\" from the game Celeste, which was also made by Matt Makes Games. Thorson also created an additional, standalone Windows game that modifies the versus mode for five to eight simultaneous players. TowerFall 8-Player released in August 2016.http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/30/12717662/towerfall-ascension-xbox-one = Physical Edition = In September 2015, Matt Makes Games partnered with the subscription box company IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to offer an exclusive, individually-numbered physical release of TowerFall. This limited edition box included a flash-drive with a DRM-free game file, official soundtrack, instruction manual, Steam key, and various custom-designed collectibles.  Reception  Multiple reviewers cited TowerFall as the standout game for the Ouya microconsole at the time of its launch. The Penny Arcade Report's Ben Kuchera called the game \\"the Ouya's killer app\\", Polygons Russ Frushtick and Chris Plante said that TowerFall was the reason to purchase an Ouya. Destructoids Spencer Hayes said that he did not consider purchasing the Ouya until he played TowerFall. He added that the game had a \\"deceptive level of depth\\". Eurogamer described its reputation as \\"the only thing worth playing on Ouya\\". The added cost of additional controllers (for four-player local multiplayer) exceeded the cost of the new console itself, and was cited as a negative for the game, though later offset by its support for Xbox 360 and PS3 controllers. Plante later described the original release as \\"critically beloved, humbly sold\\", \\"punching way above its weight class\\" with recognition on the yearend lists of Ars Technica and Polygon. By April 2014, Thorson told Eurogamer that the game had grossed a half of a million dollars, with the most sales from Ascension on the PlayStation 4. At the time, a fifth of the games sales came from Ouya, a comparatively smaller platform with a smaller install base than PlayStation and Steam. The game was a nominee for the 2014 Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Design award, but lost to Papers, Please. TowerFall Ascension received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to game review aggregator Metacritic. At the 2013 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards the game won Game, Original Fighting. Reviewers praised the game's balance, compared it favorably with Super Smash Bros., and recommended it as a party game. Critics felt that the single-player mode was a nadir, and lamented for an online multiplayer mode, with Jon Denton of Eurogamer calling the lack \\"painful\\" and \\"a crying shame\\". Griffin McElroy of Polygon found the game joyful and called it \\"a powerful distillery of childlike glee\\". IGN's Jose Otero thought highly of its visuals. He considered the single-player mode a low point of the game, that it was only useful as practice. Eurogamer Denton called it \\"an afterthought\\", and that Trials was \\"a tertiary mode at best\\". Edge wrote that the boundaries of the game's play area were confusing, and that it was difficult to watch both the area around the player-character as well as the boundaries, which worked against what they deemed to be TowerFall \\"greatest strength\\": close range combat. Denton praised the arrow catching mechanic, which he compared to the \\"hooks\\" of other \\"great multiplayer games\\", like the Ultra counter in Street Fighter IV. He further compared the multiplayer to the battle modes of Bomberman, Mario, and Super Smash Bros., the Trials mode to 10 Second Ninja, and the game's \\"immediacy\\" to Nidhogg and Samurai Gunn. Polygon named the game among the decade's top 25 games.

After having been suppressed by law enforcement authorities, the paper reemerged briefly in 1887 and 1888 with Dyer D. Lum manning the editorial chair. The Alarm was an anarchist newspaper published in the American city of Chicago during the 1880s. The weekly was the most prominent English-language anarchist periodical of its day. The paper was famously edited by Albert Parsons, who was executed in response to the Haymarket affair of 1886. Publication history =Establishment= Albert Parsons, editor of The Alarm, was among those executed in retaliation for a fatal anarchist bombing in Chicago on May 4, 1886. The first issue of The Alarm appeared on October 4, 1884 in Chicago, Illinois as the weekly voice of the International Working People's Association (IWPA).\\"The Alarm,\\" OCLC 10478576, www.worldcat.org/ At the time of its launch The Alarm was one of eight newspapers in the United States to declare their allegiance to the anarchist IWPA ‚Äî and the only paper published in English.Henry David, The History of the Haymarket Affair. [1936] Second Edition. New York: Russell and Russell, 1958; pg. 113. Editor of the paper was the Southern-born Albert R. Parsons, formerly the assistant editor of the English-language weekly of the Socialist Labor Party of America, The Socialist.Carlotta R. Anderson, All- American Anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 1998; pg. 102. Parsons had first come north from Texas in 1873 to take a job as a printer for the Chicago Inter-Ocean before moving to a more steady job in a similar capacity working for the Chicago Times.Herbert G. Gutman, \\"Alarm (Chicago and New York, 1884-1889),\\" in Joseph R. Conlin (ed.), The American Radical Press, 1880-1960: Volume 2. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1974; pg. 385. A pioneer member of the American Typographical Union as well as the Knights of Labor, the gifted orator Parsons soon emerged as among the leading English-speaking radical trade unionist in the city of Chicago, a position even more firmly established with the launch of The Alarm. =Development= Of the eight newspapers affiliated nationwide with the IWPA, five were published in Chicago alone. Joining The Alarm as Chicago-based IWPA publications were the German-language daily Arbeiter- Zeitung (Workers' Newspaper) and weeklies Der Vorbote (The Harbinger) and Der Fackel (The Torch), as well as the Czech-language weekly Budoucnost (The Future).Gutman, \\"Alarm (Chicago and New York, 1884-1889),\\" pg. 380. The paper claimed a circulation of 3,000 during the first part of 1886 ‚Äî a figure well exceeded by its non-English compatriots. By way of comparison, the Arbeiter- Zeitung maintained a circulation of between 5,000 and 6,000 in the same period, while the Vorbote ranged between 7,000 and 8,000. Der Fackel was the largest publication yet, with an 1886 circulation topping the 12,000 mark. While The Alarm was Albert Parsons' paper, he was assisted in its production by Lizzie M. Holmes, who wrote variously under the pseudonym \\"May Huntley,\\" as well as under her maiden name, \\"Lizzie M. Swank.\\" Other contributors of written material included his activist wife Lucy Parsons, C.S. Griffin, and Dyer D. Lum. The paper's finances were tenuous throughout its existence. Financing came in the form of a publishing society which sold benefactors \\"shares\\" of the paper in addition to a stream of fundraisers, including picnics and benefit evenings.David, The History of the Haymarket Affair, pg. 114. =Ideology= The Alarm styled itself as the official English-language voice of the International Working People's Association and very frequently reprinted the political platform of the IWPA in its pages. The paper unceasingly railed against private ownership of productive capital and the system of wage labor ‚Äî depicted as the root cause of a wide range of social maladies. The paper consistently argued that the state was a mechanism for the perpetuation of this unjust social order as well as an instrument for the suppression of individual political liberty.David, The History of the Haymarket Affair, pg. 115. Parsons and his co-thinkers proclaimed as their task the destruction of private property in the means of production.David, The History of the Haymarket Affair, pg. 118. If this were to be eliminated, it was argued, social ills such as poverty, crime, and war would fall away in tandem with the collapse of the old economic order. Physical force would be necessary to bring about this destruction of the old order, in the view of Parsons and The Alarm. Propaganda of the deed would inspire a revolutionary upsurge of the impoverished majority against their opulent masters, the anarchists believed. The Alarm advised: > \\"Workingmen of America, learn the manufacture and use of dynamite. It will > be your most powerful weapon; a weapon of the weak against the strong.... > Then use it unstintingly, unsparingly. The battle for bread is the battle > for life.... Death and destruction to the system and its upholders, which > plunders and enslaves the men, women, and children of toil.\\"The Alarm, Nov. > 8, 1884, quoted in David, The History of the Haymarket Affair, pg. 119. The Alarm's advocacy of the use of explosives as a tool for social change was not limited to abstract discussion. Practical advice in the manufacture and use of dynamite, nitroglycerine, and explosive devices, including such articles as a piece on bomb-making entitled \\"The Weapon of the Social Revolutionist Placed Within the Reach of All,\\"The Alarm, May 2, 1885, cited in David, The History of the Haymarket Affair, pg. 120. and another on the creation of dynamite in home laboratories, \\"A Practical Lesson on Popular Chemistry: The Manufacture of Dynamite Made Easy.\\"The Alarm, April 4, 1885, cited in David, The History of the Haymarket Affair, pg. 120. This political orientation and practical advocacy would make the paper itself a target in the aftermath of a fatal bombing in Chicago on May 4, 1886, remembered to history as the \\"Haymarket affair.\\" =Suppression= The Alarm was suppressed on May 4, 1886, a period during which Albert Parsons was still in hiding prior to his voluntary surrender to the Chicago police for trial in the Haymarket affair. The last edition of the paper to see print under Parsons' editorship was dated April 24 of that year. =Re-launch and demise= On November 5, 1887, just one week before Parson's execution by hanging in connection with the Haymarket bombing, political activist and editorial contributor Dyer D. Lum relaunched The Alarm, beginning the numbering system fresh as \\"Volume 1, Number 1.\\"\\"About The Alarm (microform), Chicago, Ill., 1884-188?\\" Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers, Library of Congress, chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ Lum managed to continue the paper without interruption until April 22, 1888, at which time publication was temporarily suspended. A restart was made on June 16, 1888, but the effort proved short-lived and The Alarm was terminated in February 1889. =Legacy= The Alarm is available to scholars and activists on microfilm, with the master negative being held by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois.

The New York City Metropolitan Area, including Brooklyn and Queens in New York City and Fair Lawn in Bergen County, New Jersey, is home to by far the largest Uzbek population in the United States. Other large Uzbek populations are most centred in Texas. San Antonio and Houston have the largest Uzbek population in Texas, but Dallas and Austin also have a considerable sized population.  History  Since the late 1950s, over 1,000 Uzbek families migrated to the United States, according to unofficial data. The first of them came from Europe, but from the mid-1960s they mainly came from Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. According to U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs Statistics,US DoS Bureau of Consular Affairs Statistics US DoS Bureau of Consular Affairs Statistics 56,028 families has won DV lottery during 1996‚Äì2016.

However, smaller pockets of Uzbek Americans can be found in other major American metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. The years of 2012 and 2013 had the largest migration of Uzbeks to the United States in history, much more so than the 1,000‚Äì1,800 green card lottery winners that were originally set in place. Most Uzbek migrants are engaged in business and science, working in various institutions and companies. Part of the Uzbek diaspora is involved in government offices, schools and colleges of the country, as well as in areas like defense, aviation and medicine. Some representatives of the Uzbek diaspora hold senior executive positions in a number of American states. In the United States, according to officials of law enforcement, representatives of the Uzbek diaspora are the most law-abiding and rarely violate the law. Among them are many families of models.  Organizations  As with other ethnic groups in the United States, Uzbek Americans also have several cultural associations. The Central Asian Foundation, established in July 2015, is a non-profit organization that promotes the social welfare of its members by developing and fostering cultural and social awareness and relations between the American and Central Asian communities in the United States. By other way, from December 13, 1958, Uzbeks of USA formed the \\"Turkestan -America\\" Association (ATA) in Philadelphia, which joined the citizens of the former Soviet Turkestan living in United States, taking advantage the growing number of immigrants in the United States of Central Asian origin. Under federal law the U.S. first registered Association in Philadelphia and, later (in 1961), it was recorded in New York. The \\" Turkestan -America \\" Association is a non -profit organization that represents the interests of the community of Central Asia in the U.S. organization and help their integration into American society. Company activities intended to provide assistance and support of the peoples of Central Asia in the United States, through the preservation of cultural and educational organizations and charitable activities of their native language, identity, cultural heritage and national traditions. In the structure of society has a council homes and offices it comes to issues of women and youth. Comprehensive strengthening and intensifying the relationship between members of society, both within their organizations and with representatives of other U.S. and foreign communities, Turkestan society promotes awareness worldwide about the association \\" Turkestan America \\" about the history and culture of the peoples of Central Asia, to foster mutual understanding, trust and friendship between the peoples of Central Asia and America supports and strengthens the links with other similar organizations such as the Federation of American Turkey. In order to improve their situation and protect the interests of the ATA provides its members a number of privileges and benefits. In particular, the Turkestan Association membership provides access to many resources and programs of society, inclusion on the mailing list of the organization; privileges in the election, the possibility to obtain special discounts on family and personal matters, space guarantees for burial on favorable terms; subscribe to newspapers, the ability to publish news and announcements on the website and ATA. Currently the company is one of the largest NGOs in the U.S. and is highly respected. The association has a rather narrow and multilateral ties with the U.S. government, is active in the political life of the country. One of the main activities of the ATA was most recently anticommunist propaganda. Members of the public have used all Congress sessions, international conferences, festivals and other events in order to inform the world about the problems of Soviet Turkestan, tried to articulate what the nations of Central Asia are not able to say in conditions of strict censorship and lack of transparency. So they were in charge of the world about Stalin Bans buried without shroud fellow Uzbek people reprisals against Gorbachev. At the same time, members of the ATA organized rallies and demonstrations outside the UN, wrote memoranda on the release of the Uzbek people . Faced with criticism of the Soviet system and protect the interests of the citizens of CA members of the association were active against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

In 1884 Ernst Beckert relocated his needle factory to Chemnitz. Already in 1888 Theodor Groz & S√∂hne founded their own health insurance fund for their employees ‚Äì the precursor of today's BKK Groz-Beckert. In 1937 the two companies merged, laying the foundation of the present group of companies. At that time, Walther Groz was the Head of the Executive Board of the company. Today, besides the headquarters there are further production sites all over the world (Germany, Belgium, Czech Republic, Portugal, India, China, Vietnam, USA).

With its product group Customized Precision Components (CPC), formerly Ceramic Punching Components, Groz-Beckert went into a new field of application of precision tools. The products are carbide tools, punches, and dies for special machines as well as precision micro-components. Since the end of 2006 also cylinders and dials for circular knitting machines are produced (former SMC). Under the name of \\"SMG\\", another line of business produces and sells plastic ball bearings and components as well as first class plastic technology products. Also the brands \\"Eisb√§r by Groz-Beckert\\", Schmeing\\", \\"Knotex\\", and \\"Grob by Groz-Beckert\\" belong to the group.

His cultural work grew out of his initial teaching job, when the director of the Palacio de Bellas Artes refused to help him bring musicians to play in Monterrey. He founded the Sociedad Art√≠stica Tecnol√≥gico, which he directed for thirty-two years, followed by stints directing several museums and other cultural institutions. He also has written poetry, essays, books and a play. Life Jos√© Emilio Amores was born in Frontera, Tabasco; however, three months later, his family went to live permanently in Mexico City. He did his schooling there, obtaining a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico . When he arrived to Monterrey in the 1940s, he thought the city was ugly, squat and hot, but soon found things that he felt were important, respect for human life and individuality, with little violence compared to the rest of the country. He says that people there felt that the north of the country had no culture, although he disagreed with that. He stated that they were aware that they had a ‚Äúculture‚Äù of working and saving, distinct from the rest of the country, but did not accept that as culture as in artistic expression. Amores was active well into his later years. As of the late 1990s, he stated he still liked to travel in Mexico, although he could no longer do long-distance driving. His house was filled with elements related to the arts including a piano, sculptures, paintings, books, records and videos. Two of his closest friends were Virgilioi Garza and Ram√≥n Lamadrid, with the three calling themselves the ‚ÄúLos Memelos.‚Äù Teaching career Amores began his career at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies in 1944, become one of the first chemistry teachers at the institution. His father reading the paper found an announcement for the job as a chemistry teacher and mentioned it to his son. Amores walked fifteen city blocks to the office in Mexico City where he met the first director of the Tec de Monterrey Le√≥n √Åvalos y Vez. The director was impressed with his references, which included those of Manuel Sandoval Vallarta and Carlos Graef Fern√°ndez, two of the founders of modern physics in Mexico. Soon after, he was on a bus to Monterrey and worked in the first building to house the institution. In 1947, Amores became the director of the preparatory and began to teach algebra as well. He remained director of the preparatory until 1959, then was director of the engineering and architecture school from 1959 to 1966 and vice-rector of academics from 1966 to 1969. Career as a ‚Äúcultural promoter‚Äù In 1947, Amores was asked to visit the director of the Palacio de Bellas Artes, Carlos Ch√°vez to see about having some young musicians play at the Tec de Monterrey. However, he was not well- received, with the director saying ‚ÄúLook, I will never waste my time in the provinces, but if someday I do, I will not work with a private institution; I will work with the government.‚Äù However, the school was able to get a local business to sponsor a piano recital by Walter Hautzig, with Amores needing to find a piano. This was one of a number of performances to follow. The success of these events led to the creation of the Sociedad Art√≠stica Tecnol√≥gico, which he directed for thirty-two years. This work led him to become a major force in the development of the arts in the city. He retired from the Tec de Monterrey in 1969 and held a number of positions in organizations such as director of the Desarrollo Social del Grupo Alfa, undersecretary of culture for Nuevo Le√≥n, the director of the Museo de Monterrey (1988-1990), the director of the Centro Cultural Alfa, the director of the Museo de Historia Mexicana and the director of Radio Nuevo Le√≥n (1996-1998) . Although generally known as a ‚Äúcultural promoter‚Äù he does not see himself that way, just one of many in the city who does what he does. In 1998, he was paid homage by the city for his cultural work. As a writer He began to write poetry five years after he retired from the Tec de Monterrey, and wrote essays and books as well. Many of his essays related to efforts to save green spaces in Monterrey, such as Parque Fundida, but was not always successful. His books include Los siete d√≠as de la creaci√≥n (1977), Lectura de Hoy (1978) and the chapter Monterrey: Una cultura propia in Nuevo Le√≥n en el Siglo XX:La Industrializaci√≥n Vol II (2007).

It is thought to have been painted after 1625, and thus in the last three years of Ter Brugghen's life; he died in 1629. The painting shows a marked departure from Ter Brugghen's earlier painting in its emphasis on play of light, its baroque quality and a resolved sensibility. Composition The painting depicts a scene from the Denial of Peter as specifically recounted in the Gospel of Luke chapter 22: > \\"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set > down together, Peter sat down among them. But a certain maid beheld him as > he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was > also with him. And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.\\" The action takes place in an interior. Two soldiers are warming themselves around a fire, one evidently asleep, one rousing as a servant girl points at Saint Peter in the act of accusing him. He is cowering in the very left of the painting. Diametrically opposite and in a separate scene is Christ taken by soldiers. Their fence-like sticks echoes that of the soldier on the ground, the sticks in the fire, illuminating the scene, and the tent-pole or stick behind Peter and his accuser. A figure stares out at the viewer from the scene of the taking of Christ. This scene is taken from Albrecht D√ºrer's Small Passion: Pilate Washing his Hands of 1512 where it is also used as a background motif and, in much the same way, implicates the viewer, through the staring soldier, in the foreground goings-on; there Pilate absolving himself, here Peter himself. Albrecht D√ºrer, Pilate Washing his Hands, engraving on copper, 118 √ó 75 mm, Metropolitan Museum of Art A painting in the Shipley Art Gallery in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England, attributed to Ter Brugghen, appropriates D√ºrer's composition directly and in reverse. This is again copied in another, nearly identical, painting by Ter Brugghen in the Lublin Museum, Poland. The soldier supporting himself on his hands, perhaps in the act of getting up, is similar to a semi-recumbent figure in the left foreground of Caravaggio's Martyrdom of Saint Matthew installed in the Contarelli Chapel, Rome in July 1600; early enough for Ter Brugghen to have known it during his sojourn in the Eternal City no later than 23 April 1607 when he is placed there by Utrecht records. The second soldier, to the right, is taken from The Resurrection of Christ from Albrecht D√ºrer's Small Passion. Albrecht D√ºrer, The Resurrection, woodcut, 12.7 x 9.8 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art The figure of the maidservant has her closest parallel in a fragment of a Denial at Stourhead, where the accusing arm is modelled in the same manner. The female model appears elsewhere, in The Concert (about 1927), wearing a similar headdress and costume, and in Girl Blowing on a Firebrand (circa 1626-1627). Origins and Provenance Ter Brugghen's Denial has strong similarities in style to his The Liberation of Peter at the Staatliche Museum, Schwerin. Here the sparseness of the composition has done away altogether with the tradition of having two sleeping guards present. The picture is signed and dated 1629, the year Ter Brugghen died, giving us an indication that Denial might also have been painted around this time. The Art Institute of Chicago next finds the present painting in the collection of Reedtz-Thott, Guan√∏ Castle near N√¶stved, Denmark, by about 1750. It was owned by Baron Kjeld Thor Tage Otto Reedtz-Thott (1839-1923), 2nd Baron Guan√∏ by at least 1914, from whom it descended to Baron Axel Reedtz-Thott. He sold it to a London dealer in the late 1960s. By 1968, it was with Wildenstein & Company, New York and was purchased by the Chicago Institute in February 1969 from the Charles H. and Mary F. S. Worcester Collection.

After being beaten in both her races as a two-year-old and disqualified on her three-year- old debut, the filly won the Lingfield Oaks Trial, the Oaks Stakes and Irish Oaks before her career was ended by injury in the Yorkshire Oaks. She was then retired to stud, where she had some success as a broodmare. Background Juliette Marny was a bay mare with no white markings bred in Wiltshire by the Fonthill Stud which was managed by James Ian Morrison, the filly's owner throughout her racing career. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Blakeney the winner of the 1969 Epsom Derby, who was standing at the National Stud. Juliette Marny's dam Set Free, was in fact the first mare covered in Blakeney's first season at stud after the inexperienced stallion reportedly \\"took a while to realise was what required of him\\". Set Free was a moderate racehorse, with a best Timeform rating of 90, but she became an outstanding broodmare. In 1975 she produced the St Leger Stakes winner Julio Mariner (also by Blakeney) and in the following year she foaled Scintillate a filly who won the Oaks in 1979. The filly, named after the heroine of the novel I Will Repay, was sent into training with Jeremy Tree at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= Juliette Marny failed to win in two races as a two-year-old in 1974. She showed some promise on her second appearance when she finished second in a race at Salisbury Racecourse. =1975: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Juliette Marny contested the Group Three Princess Elizabeth Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Epsom Downs Racecourse in April. She finished first, beating Persian Market by two lengths, but was disqualified and placed last after veering to the left in the closing stages and causing interference. Her jockey, Greville Starkey was suspended for his performance and did not ride the filly again. In May, Juliette Marny was moved up in distance to contest the Oaks Trial over one and a half miles at Lingfield Park Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott, she won by a head from Harmonise, a filly who was carrying five pounds more. On 7 June, Juliette Marny contested the 197th running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom and started at odds of 12/1 in a field of twelve fillies. Piggott had the choice of Tree's two entries and elected to ride Juliette Marny ahead of Jock Whitney's filly Brilliantine. Racing on firm ground, she took the lead a furlong from the finish and drew clear to win very easily by four lengths from Val's Girl with the favourite Moonlight Night in third. Piggott, who equaled the record of 21 British classic victories said: \\"We were never in any danger ... Juliette Marny was running away in the straight.\\" Tree called the result \\"the highlight of my career.\\" In the Irish Oaks a month later at the Curragh, she was opposed by a field which included Nobiliary, a filly who had finished second to Grundy in The Derby. Juliette Marny ridden by Piggott (who could have ridden any of the three ) won by a neck from Tuscarora, with Nobiliary in third. In August, Juliette Marny was sent to York Racecourse for the Yorkshire Oaks. She finished third behind May Hill, sustaining a leg injury which ended her racing career. Assessment and honours In 1975, the independent Timeform organisation gave Juliette Marny a rating of 123, placing her ten pounds behind the season's top rated three- year-old filly Rose Bowl. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Juliette Marny an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record Juliette Marny was retired from racing to become a broodmare at Fonthill Stud, where she produced at least seven winners: 1978 Sans Dot (GB), bay filly, by Busted (GB) - 4th LR Sir Charles Clore Memorial Stakes, Newbury from 2 starts in England 1981 1979 North Briton (GB), bay colt, foaled 14 April, by Northfields (USA) - won two races from 28 starts in England 1980 Jolly Bay (GB), bay filly, by Mill Reef (USA) - won LR Pretty Polly Stakes from 4 starts in England 1983 1981 Aunt Judy (GB), chestnut filly, foaled 15 April, by Great Nephew (GB) - unplaced all six starts in Britain 1983-84 1988 Surrey Dancer (GB), bay colt, foaled 22 April, by Shareef Dancer (USA), won thirteen races 1989 July Girl (GB), bay filly, foaled 1 January, by Rousillon (USA), won Listed Premio Pietro Bessero 1991 Lac Ladoga (GB), chestnut colt, foaled 1 January, by Sharpo (GB), won one race from 6 starts in France 1995-97 1992 Duchess of Alba (GB), bay filly, foaled 13 May, by Belmez (USA) won one race from 4 starts in England 1995, dam of Nicobar (won Sandown Mile, Premio Emilio Turati, sire of Dunaden) 1994 Jaunty Jack (GB), bay colt, foaled 23 March, by Midyan (USA), won five races including Gran Premio d'Italia Juliette Marny's daughter Sans Dot (by Busted failed to win a race but produced the Grade I winning hurdlers French Holly and Deano's Beeno.

The musical is based on the 1963 Profumo affair involving the War Minister John Profumo and the socialite Stephen Ward who introduced Profumo to his mistress Christine Keeler, who was also involved with a Russian spy. The musical's world premiere was in London's West End at the Aldwych Theatre in 2013. Background In February 2012, Webber first revealed in an interview with the British broadcaster Chris Evans that he was considering working on a show based on the Profumo affair. A first reading of the musical was held in London in early 2013, with its first public staging in March, with Milos Karadaglic performing the title song from the show on an ITV special Andrew Lloyd Webber: 40 Musical Years. The track was later released as a digital download. Officially confirmed on 28 June 2013, producers announced that the initial production would be staged at the Aldwych Theatre, with tickets going on sale immediately. The show, budgeted at ¬£2.5 million had a book with lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton and is directed by Richard Eyre, with choreography by Stephen Mear, set design by Rob Howell, lighting design by Peter Mumford and sound by Paul Groothuis. In 2014, the full libretto of the musical was published by Faber and Faber in book form. Production history =West End (2013)= Stephen Ward began previews on 3 December 2013, at the Aldwych Theatre, London, before holding its official opening night on 19 December, booking until 1 March. On 6 September 2013, full casting was announced with Alexander Hanson playing the title role of Stephen Ward, Charlotte Spencer as Christine Keeler, Joanna Riding as Valerie Hobson, Charlotte Blackledge as Mandy Rice Davies, Anthony Calf as Lord Astor, Daniel Flynn as John Profumo, Ian Conningham as Ivanov, Christopher Howell as Percival Murray, Ricardo Coke Thomas as Lucky Gordon and Wayne Robinson as Johnny Edgecombe. The West End production of Stephen Ward received mixed reviews from critics. The official opening night was overshadowed by an incident at the Apollo Theatre : during a performance of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, part of the theatre's ceiling fell onto the audience. Members of the West End theatre circuit, managers and producers, who were attending the premiere of Stephen Ward were told of the incident during the interval; many left the theatre to attend to the incident at the Apollo Theatre. Media who were attending Stephen Ward were diverted by news-desks to cover the incident at the Apollo Theatre. The planned after-show press room was cancelled, once the scale of the incident at the Apollo Theatre became clear and that audience members had been hurt. Despite initially announcing the production would extend to 31 May, the show closed on 29 March 2014, the same day as Lloyd Webber's former lyricist collaborator Tim Rice's show From Here to Eternity. A typical London performance ran 2hrs 20mins, including one interval. Michael Billington believes Lloyd Webber's \\"great gift is for writing music about either fulfilled or unrequited romantic passion\\". On Stephen Ward, he wondered why Lloyd Webber \\"ever felt it was the right subject for his particular talents and why the producers thought a show about a flagrant miscarriage of justice half a century ago had much resonance for a modern audience.\\" An admirer of Lloyd Webber, Billington believed such a project had demanded the \\"satirical bite\\" which Kander and Ebb displayed in the musicals Cabaret and Chicago.

It is or was endemic to the Mae Klong and Chao Phraya River basins in Thailand. Taxonomy and discovery  The burnt-tailed barb was long considered as conspecific with the bala shark (Balantiocheilos melanopterus) until it was described as separate species in 2007.Ng, Heok Hee; Kottelat, Maurice (2007). \\"Balantiocheilos ambusticauda, a new and possibly extinct species of cyprinid fish from Indochina (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae)\\". Zootaxa 1463: 13‚Äì20. The holotype was collected by German ichthyologist Rolf Geisler (1925‚Äì2012) in February 1967 at Bung Boraphet, Nakhon Sawan province, Thailand. The material labelled as paratypes was collected by Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee in 1936, by M. Harmand in 1883, and by Marie Firmin Bocourt in 1862. Description The burnt-tailed barb is closely related to the bala shark (B. melanopterus). It differs from its congener by a shorter snout, grooves which are posteriorly directed at rictus curved (vs. straight in the bala shark), and narrower black margins on the pelvic and anal fins (on distal third or less compared to the bala shark where the black margins are on distal half or more). Distribution and status It is endemic to Thailand where known from the Mae Klong and Chao Phraya River basins. It has also been reported from the Mekong Basin in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, but confirmed records from this basin are lacking and this is not recognized as part of its range by the IUCN. The closely related B. melanopterus has been reported from the same rivers, but this is due to confusion with B. ambusticauda; the true native range of B. melanopterus is further south in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra. Large numbers of B. melanopterus are exported from Thailand for the aquarium trade, but these are all captive bred. From Kittipong Jaruthanin's notes, who is Thai freshwater fish explorer said he found the last fish in nature habitat at one Bang Mot tangerine orchard's ditch, that drains from Chao Phraya River in Rat Burana district (now it becomes Thung Khru district), Bangkok's Thonburi side in 1986.Kittipong Jaruthanin & Chavalit Vidthayanon, ‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏à‡∏∑‡∏î‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î ‡πë‡πê ‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (The Top - Ten endangered freshwater fishes of Thailand), Aquarium Biz, Vol. 2 Issue 16 (October 2011) Despite surveys within its native range, it has not been recorded in more than three decades and is likely extinct.

After February 2013, it was officially renamed the CBD Rebuild Zone by government agencies, but remained known as the Red Zone. It gradually shrank in size and the last cordons were removed on 30 June 2013, 859 days after the earthquake. Background Colombo Street in May 2011; 15 people died in this section, including 8 on buses hit by falling fa√ßades = February 2011 earthquake = The February 2011 earthquake caused widespread damage across Christchurch, especially in the central city and eastern suburbs, with damage exacerbated by buildings and infrastructure already being weakened by the 4 September 2010 earthquake and its aftershocks. The earthquake, which struck at lunchtime on a weekday, caused devastation in the central city, with two large office buildings having collapsed (the CTV Building and the PGC House), many historic building fa√ßades had collapsed into the streets, two buses were crushed by falling fa√ßades in Colombo Street, and many people in City Mall were trapped by fallen masonry. A total of 185 people died in the February earthquake, 169 died in the central zone alone: 115 in the CTV building, 18 at PGC House, 8 on buses in Colombo Street and 28 others in various CBD locations. Authorities cleared the central city of people, established a cordon on the day of the earthquake and denied access. The day after the earthquake, the government declared a state of national emergency, which stayed in force until 30 April 2011. =Colour confusion= Oxford Terrace in the Avon Loop, an area that was initially in the Central City Red Zone and later became part of the residential red zone Post-Christchurch had a confusing colour-coding applied, with the same colour meaning different things in different areas. The Central City Red Zone is not to be confused with the residential red zone. In the central city, it described the area that was cordoned off after the earthquake. In the eastern suburbs, the colour red refers to land that is subject to liquefaction or the related effect of lateral spreading and that is deemed uneconomic to repair; with over 7,000 properties being purchased by The Crown under what has been called a voluntary yet coercive scheme ‚Äì while residents were free to refuse the government's buyout of their homes, the government cautioned that remaining in place would entail a lack of insurance, infrastructure, and city services. In the Port Hills, red zoning refers to land where it is not economic to protect buildings that are at risk from rockfall, or land that is unstable due to its proximity to cliffs, with The Crown offering to buy the land. 510 properties are zoned red in the Port Hills. As explained below, the Central City Red Zone was further divided, with an outer orange zone accessible to residents. In the eastern suburbs, the orange zone was that land that had yet to be assessed and zoned (either green, blue, or red). There was no orange zone in the Port Hills, though, and land that had yet to be classified was zoned white. A white zone also applied in the central city initially, as geotechnical assessments were not carried out there for many months. The Avon Loop, which is located in the central city, further adds to the colour confusion. Until 13 March 2011, the Avon Loop was in the orange zone of the Central City Red Zone. When the residential land zoning was first announced in June 2011, the Avon Loop was zoned orange. Much of the Avon Loop was eventually zoned red, and this is the only land in the central city that was initially in the Central City Red Zone which later became part of the Residential Red Zone. Cordon Manchester Street on the day of the earthquake An initial cordon was established by Police and the New Zealand Army around the perimeter along the central city along Bealey Avenue, Fitzgerald Avenue, Moorhouse Avenue, Antigua Street, Rolleston Avenue, and Park Terrace. Within days, cordon checkpoints were also manned by Australian Police (mostly New South Wales Police Force and Australian Federal Police) and Singapore Armed Forces. The CBD fringe is in large areas of residential nature, so the initial cordon saw many residents within the restricted area. At the last census in 2006, some 7,600 people lived within the three census zones (Avon Loop, Cathedral Square, and Hagley Park) that make up the central city. A triangular area defined by Antigua Street, Hagley Avenue, and Moorhouse Avenue in the south-west of the central city was outside of the cordon. Not much of that area is residential, though, as large areas are occupied by Christchurch Hospital, Hagley Community College, and many industrial uses. Hence, some 7,000 residents were initially affected by the red zone. The cordoned area was thus further subdivided, with an outer orange zone accessible to residents, but no access to the inner red zone other than people authorised first by Civil Defence and later by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA). Residents living in the inner red zone did not have access to their buildings and had to find accommodation elsewhere. A vehicle recovery programme was initiated by Police around 10 March 2011. Cars and bicycles were transferred to a secured compound within Hagley Park, from where vehicle owners could retrieve their vehicles. On 21 March 2011, about 100 business owners protested at the Art Gallery, the temporary headquarters of Civil Defence, about lack of access to critical business property (e.g. computer servers, merchandise, cash) as well as a lack of communication, with some buildings having been demolished without any prior communication. They demanded to speak to the National Controller of Civil Defence, John Hamilton. When Hamilton would not see them, some of the business owners breached the inner cordon in protest by simply walking past soldiers manning the entrances, but within minutes, Police started arresting the protesters and pushed protesters back outside the inner cordon. The next day, the Government issued a press release, with Civil Defence Minister John Carter stating that it was \\"foolish to breach the cordon around the red zone. People died behind that cordon.\\" The employment of the New Zealand Army finished on 28 June 2013, after the army having served for 858 days. The cordon was removed two days later on 30 June 2013. Many individual buildings are still fenced off, as they are deemed unstable by the authorities; this includes the Anglican Cathedral in Cathedral Square. Over time, the role of the army personnel at the cordon entry points changed from simply restricting access to become guides to tourists and locals alike, with even locals not knowing their way around any longer as so many landmarks have been demolished. Timeline The first time that CERA set a target date for the removal of the red zone cordons was in September 2011, when a 1 April 2012 removal was announced. A red zone removal by 28 June 2013 was first announced in March 2013; the ultimate removal date was 30 June.

Halodule uninervis (Forssk√•l) Ascherson. AlgaeBase. National University of Ireland, Galway. Accessed 28 June 2013. Distribution and habitat This is a common plant of the sublittoral zone in its range, growing in depths up to 20 meters in lagoons, on reefs, and in many other types of marine habitat just offshore. It is known from Asian waters along the coasts of Japan, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other nations. It occurs on Pacific Islands such as Fiji. It occurs along the Australian Pacific coast, including the Great Barrier Reef. It can be found along Indian Ocean coastal regions from Australia to India to eastern Africa. It is resident in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Description This species is a flowering plant spreading via a branching rhizome that roots at the nodes. It produces erect stems and alternately arranged leaves. The narrow, toothed leaf blades are up to 15 centimeters long and usually roughly a millimeter wide,Halodule uninervis. Flora of China. though leaf width is variable and can be up to 7 millimeters. Each leaf has a sturdy sheath up to 3.5 centimeters long. The tip of the leaf blade has three teeth.Halodule uninervis. New South Wales Flora Online. National Herbarium, Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney. Plants of this family are dioecious. The male flower is borne on a short peduncle and is enclosed in a leaf. The tiny anthers are red. The fruit is about 2 millimeters long. Leaf morphology changes according to habitat type. The leaves are wider in deeper waters. There are apparently two morphs, a narrow leaf and a wide leaf, rather than a continuous range. The narrow leaf type is found closer to shore where it is exposed more often. The wide leaf type is found in deeper areas with cloudier waters. Plants that receive less light may need more leaf blade area to perform enough photosynthesis.Hedge, S., et al. (2009).

Report to the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Reef and Rainforest Research Centre Limited, Cairns. Biology This grass forms dense carpets or meadows on the substrate, sometimes mixing with other seagrasses and algaes. It occupies the lower intertidal zone, and it is less tolerant of exposure to air than are plants of the upper intertidal zone such as Thalassia hemprichii. It desiccates quickly. It is also sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. These factors restrict it to deeper intertidal waters than some other plants.Lan, C. Y., et al. (2005).

Conservation This plant is widely distributed and it is common throughout its range. In general its populations are stable, though it may be decreasing in localized areas, such as the coast of Bangladesh, and it fluctuates in some Australian waters. It is affected by some degradation of habitat by forces such as coastal development, siltation, sedimentation, weather events and tidal action, predation, parasites, disease, trawling and other fishing practices, dredging, pollution, eutrophication, and climate change. Conservation plans are in effect in various regions. Populations are monitored in the United Arab Emirates. It grows within the bounds of several marine parks and reserves in Africa. Populations can be disturbed only with permits in parts of Australia. Large beds are protected in Hat Chao Mai National Park in Thailand. References External links *WoRMS. (2013).

Abrea Armstrong of XXL felt that his lyrics are still confident, but now informed by new life experiences, and recommended Summer Knights to hip hop buffs rather than Badass' typically teenage listeners, although she wrote that \\"Joey is here to prove that they're the same.\\" In a mixed review, Phillip Mlynar of Spin felt that Summer Knights lacks the immediacy of his early music and found his rapping dull and enervated, which he mused is a result of pressures and expectations from the music industry.Music & Film Reviews  NME.COM On December 24, 2013, XXL positioned it at number 19 on their list of the best mixtapes of 2013. They commented saying, \\"One thing is clear when you listen to the tape, he‚Äôs not kidding around, as he unleashes some bone- shattering bars with a calm cold assassin-like demeanor. 1999 was more of a coming-of-age tale from Joey while Summer Knights provides as a worthy follow- up illustrating his maturity and growth.

Life Hogness spent most of his youth in Chicago, the son of Thorfin R. Hogness and Phoebe S. Hogness. His parents were both children of immigrants and graduates of the University of Minnesota; his father later received a PhD in chemistry from the University of California at Berkeley, taught at Berkeley and in 1930 joined the faculty at the University of Chicago. After service in the Navy, David Hogness acquired his bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1949 at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); and in 1952, his PhD in biology and chemistry. As a postdoctoral fellow, he worked with a scholarship of the National Research Council with Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and with a grant from the National Science Foundation at the New York University in New York City. In 1955, Hogness became an instructor of microbiology at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and was promoted to an assistant professor in 1957. In 1959, he moved to Stanford University School of Medicine. In 1961 he became an associate professor and in 1966, he was promoted to full professor of biochemistry. In 1989 he also became a joint faculty member in Stanford's newly created Department of Developmental Biology. He was professor emeritus since 1999. Hogness married Judith Gore in 1948; the couple had two sons. Research Hogness was essential to understanding the ontogeny of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). He examined the role of the hormone ecdysone in the development of the fruit fly. In 1978, Hogness and his group identified the TATA box (Goldberg-Hogness box) as the start sequence for the transcription of genes in eukaryotes. Hogness' work contributed to the discovery that the genetic material of eukaryotes consists of non-coding (introns) and coding (exons) sections and that the expression of numerous genes is regulated by so-called cis-elements. Hogness contributed to the fusion of genetics, molecular biology and developmental biology. Awards *1965 Newcomb Cleveland Prize *1968 Guggenheim FellowDavid S.

In its 2013 report Transnational Organized Crime in Eastern Africa: A Threat Assessment, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that > China‚Äôs recent wave of investment in Africa has brought thousands of Chinese > executives and workers to the continent, including countries where ivory is > openly sold, often carved into items for the Asian market.

The quantities involved are > generally small (although tusks cut into suitcase-sized chunks have been > detected), but, due to their frequency, could constitute a major source of > supply. Chinese nationals on the ground in Tanzania have been jailed in connection with large-scale interdictions. In November 2013 three Chinese nationals were arrested in Dar es Salaam with a stockpile of 797 tusks. Growing purchasing power among Chinese tuhao and baofahu has combined with corruption among Tanzanian rangers and police to devastating effect. Between 2010 and 2013, over three tonnes of ivory has been seized in Tanzania, and two-thirds of the elephants at Selous Game Reserve‚ÄîTanzania's largest‚Äîhave disappeared. According to the United Nations report, the link between Chinese demand and Tanzanian supply is the single most destructive influence on the African elephant population: * Recent research indicates that the rate of poaching in Eastern Africa has increased, rising to levels that could threaten the local elephant population. * The bulk of the large ivory shipments from Africa to Asia appears to pass through the container ports of Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania, where interventions could be addressed. * It is estimated that between 5,600 and 15,400 elephants are poached in Eastern Africa annually, producing between 56 and 154 metric tons of illicit ivory, of which two-thirds (37 tons) is destined for Asia, worth around US$30 million in 2011. * Expatriate Chinese residents in Eastern Africa comprise some of the most important middlemen. Although they have taken measures to address the illicit trade, Thailand and China remain two of the most important destinations. * Recent Interpol operations...have found a growing number of carved objects...with vendors speaking Chinese to their clients. In the immediate aftermath of the UNODC findings, Tanzania's Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism was forced to respond to citizen complaints of \\"... Chinese nationals, engaging in the massacre of our animals and transporting them to their countries for their own benefit.\\" Lazaro Nyalandu said that the government of Tanzania would take action against poachers without regard to their countries of origin, and that any threat against tourism revenues would be taken seriously. In March 2014 Chinese national Yu Bo appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrates‚Äô Court in Dar es Salaam, accused of illegally collecting 81 elephant tusks. Yu petitioned for leniency, citing his several dependents and lack of criminal history, as he entered a guilty plea. Senior Resident Magistrate Devota Kisoka imposed a fine of 9,781,204,900 Tanzanian shillings, in default of which Yu is detained in Tanzania pending appeal of a 20-year sentence. Chinese officials have taken steps to curb the influx of illegal ivory‚Äîof the 900 ivory seizures performed annually in China, 90% involve items uncovered in hand inspections of travelers' luggage‚Äîand they are not known to have offered legal-, financial-, or political assistance to Chinese nationals suspected of poaching in Tanzania.

The brigade was part of the Territorial Force and created as a 2nd Line of the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade and part of the 65th (2nd Lowland) Division, itself formed as a 2nd Line of the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The brigade was initially composed of four battalions of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). Origin The units and formations of the Territorial Force were mobilised on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914. Almost immediately, they were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form them into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. The large numbers of volunteers coming forward were assigned to these 2nd Line units for training. Later, the Home Service men were separated into provisional units, while the 2nd Line continued to train drafts for the 1st Line serving overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.

Service The brigade was formed in January 1915, but progressive training of the 2nd Line units was hampered by the need to provide frequent reinforcement drafts to the 1st Line, by the lack of up-to-date arms and equipment, and the reorganisation when Home Service men were drafted to separate units. By August 195, 65th (2nd L) Division had concentrated round Bridge of Allan, with 195th Bde at Cambusbarron, where it remained until March 1916. In that month the division moved to Essex, where it joined Southern Army (Home Forces), with 195th Bde at Billericay, later at Witham and Terling. Early in 1917 the division was sent to Ireland to relieve 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, which had been based there since the Easter Rising of 1916. 195th Brigade was dispersed to Fermoy, Tralee, Limerick, Moore Park and Kilworth. 65th (2nd Lowland) Division and its brigades were disbanded on 18 March 1918.

The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968. The term was first introduced in Japan, with an externally mounted badge on the trunk of vehicles equipped. Nissan's implementation began with the Y44E V8 engine installed in the Nissan President along with all vehicles installed with the Nissan L engine and the Nissan A engine in 1975. The initial introduction of Nissan's technology was the installation of an exhaust gas recirculation valve, followed with the addition of a catalytic converter and an air pump that added oxygen into the exhaust to promote higher temperatures in the catalytic converter, thus cleaning the exhaust further. The NAPS-Z technology, introduced in 1978, was developed with assistance from Hitachi.Yamaguchi, Jack K., \\"Japan: Reluctant Number One\\", World Cars 1981: 66 It uses a novel implementation of two spark plugs per cylinder, called dual ignition together with electronically controlled fuel injection, installed on the Nissan Z engine. This terminology is often confused with the engine installed in the Nissan 280Z, which used the \\"L\\" engine. However, the NAPS technology was installed in the Fairlady/Z and sold internationally. Another version of the twin spark plug method was introduced on the Nissan Stanza with the CA engine, called NAPS-X, which eventually replaced the NAPS-Z approach. The CA engine implemented a hemispherical cylinder head, an approach used by several auto makers.

In the early 2000s, Dish Network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers. Most notably, when the Hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without commercials, major networks sued Dish Network. AutoHop Dish Network's Hopper digital video recorder, announced in January 2012, led to controversy over a feature, called \\"AutoHop\\", which allows viewers to watch some programming without commercials, subject to time restrictions. AutoHop is an extension of the DVR's prime time recording capability. When activated, the feature records but hides commercials, giving viewers the option of viewing primetime programming on the four major networks commercial-free. Commercials cannot be skipped until 1 am Eastern Time, and the viewer must choose to do this. Recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired. News of AutoHop met with an immediate, polarized response. The feature was deemed a \\"dream come true\\" for consumers, but for networks, a nightmare undercutting the revenue model. Dish asserted that AutoHop would encourage its customers to sample new programming. Leslie Moonves, CBS chief executive, asked rhetorically how he is to produce CSI without the revenue stream of commercials. News Corporation refused to accept Dish advertising for the device. A Forrester Research analyst said the move demonstrated Dish's desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the Internet. The controversy surrounding AutoHop contributed to one small-market station group, Hoak Media Corporation, removing its 14 stations channels from the service on June 6, 2012. In negotiations, Hoak sought a 200 percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the AutoHop feature. David Shull, Dish senior vice president of programming, accused Hoak of effectively telling Dish's customers that they must watch commercials, disrespecting customer control over its services. Eight days later, the two companies announced a distribution deal. Terms were not disclosed. On June 27, 2012, Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen told the United States House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and fast food advertising. The next day, Michael Petricone of the Consumer Electronics Association spoke to the subcommittee, likening Hopper to earlier time shifting devices. He argued that Hopper is legal and that AutoHop entices people to watch more television, thereby expanding television's market. CNET was also forced by parent company CBS to disqualify the newest Hopper with Sling model from the CES Best in Show award for 2013 because of its active litigation with the company. CEO Joe Clayton said that Dish was \\"saddened that CNET's staff is being denied its editorial independence because of CBS' heavy- handed tactics.\\" Dish Network directly attacked CBS for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website. The ad proclaimed the DVR as being CNET's \\"Best in Show\\", but with a footnote stating that \\"CBS will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying ad-skipping technologyeven censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name Hopper 'Best In Show.' Your vote is the only one that really matters.\\" Telemarketing violations Dish Network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics, such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered. Dish Network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges. In March 2009 the Federal Trade Commission charged Dish Network and two of its dealers with multiple violations of the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. Fee disclosures In January 2004, thirteen states charged that Echostar, then the parent company of Dish Network, had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers' bank accounts for hidden fees. The company settled the lawsuit, paid $5 million, and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers. Dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with Dish. The shipping cost as of Sept. 2014 is $17. This fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed. Programming disagreements Dish Network has a lengthy history of carriage disputes. =QTN= Dish Network began negotiations with GTN (Gay Television Network) to carry the channel. GTN sent out a press release on February 2, 2001, announcing its launch and that its channel would be carried by Dish Network.

In the dispute, several CBS O&O; stations, as well as all the channels of Showtime would originally be slated to be removed on November 20. However Dish reached 2 short-term extension agreements, the first on the date of the original deadline and the second short-term agreement was reached on the afternoon of the last day of the original extension agreement of November 26. Then CBS announced on December 2 that they would have removed the stations on the evening of December 4 if a new deal wasn't reached by then. Dish then got another short-term agreement to extend the deadline by one day. On December 5, Dish dropped CBS O&O; stations in 14 markets Then on December 6, a day later, DISH and CBS reached a multi- year deal that would restore the CBS O&O; stations in 14 markets as well as allow DISH customers to continue watching Showtime, The Movie Channel, Flix, CBS Sports Network, TVGN (which became Pop in early 2015) and would bring back Smithsonian Channel and DISH also added Showtime Anytime, and would allow CBS program to have ad-skip for their programming for Dish's Primetime Anytime on the Hopper DVR systems 7 days after the shows originally aired, which is 4 days longer than Disney/ABC's deal for the ad-skip feature. In early 2016, Dish announced the removal of all Viacom channels set for the night of April 20. Although Viacom says it offered Dish financial terms ‚Äúas good as larger distributors,‚Äù the No. 2 satellite company ‚Äúmade demands that are designed to be impossible to meet in order to take our negotiations public and likely force our programming off the air.‚Äù =Disney/ABC/ESPN lawsuit= On August 4, 2009, Dish Network sued ESPN for $1 million in a federal lawsuit, alleging that it had breached its contract by not extending the same carriage terms the programmer provided to Comcast and DirecTV for ESPNU and ESPN Classic. The lawsuit claims ESPN violated the \\"Most Favored Nations\\" clause. The next day, ESPN announced they will fight the lawsuit and said in a press release: \\"We have repeatedly advised Dish Network that we are in full compliance with our agreement and have offered them a distribution opportunity with respect to ESPNU and ESPN Classic consistent with the rest of the industry. We will not renegotiate settled contracts and will vigorously defend this legal action, the apparent sole purpose of which is to get a better deal.\\" Dish Network moved ESPNU from its \\"America's Top 250\\" package to its \\"America's Top 120\\" package on September 30, 2009. However, they claim it has nothing to do with the lawsuit. On June 22, 2010, The Walt Disney Company (owner of ESPN) pulled ESPNews HD, Disney Channel HD, Disney XD HD and ABC Family HD from the Dish Network channel list because of Dish's \\"Free HD for Life\\" campaign, although the standard definition channels remained.https://web.archive.org/web/20100625044033/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT- CO-20100622-712323.html Disney later sued Dish because of the Hopper system which allows the stripping of commercials from their networks, and the animus affected both to the point where the original carriage agreement which expired in October 2013 was extended due to the Hopper, ESPN and HD issues while those were worked out to prevent the loss of access to Disney-ABC networks Dish and Disney finally came to terms on all of the issues on March 4, 2014, which will allow Disney to launch Disney Junior, Fusion, ESPN Goal Line, the Longhorn Network and SEC Network on Dish, along with the launch or return of HD feeds for their other networks, along with mobile app access to Disney-ABC networks via Dish's TV Everywhere logins. ESPN Classic was returned solely as a video on demand option. In return, Disney agreed to drop legal action against Dish for the Hopper system in exchange for programming recorded on ABC stations by Hopper DVR's being disallowed from having their advertising stripped until 72 hours after its original broadcast. =The Weather Channel= On May 20, 2010, Dish Network announced that it was dropping The Weather Channel at midnight ET that day in favor of its own similar weather information channel, The Weather Cast. The switch was due to high rates that The Weather Channel demanded Dish Network to pay (The Weather Channel requested a rate increase from 11 cents per subscriber per month to 12 cents).Dish Network is dropping The Weather Channel. The Weather Channel news release (May 20, 2010) As of May 24, The Weather Channel stated that it had come to an agreement with Dish Network that would result in Dish Network carrying The Weather Channel for the next several years. Despite the earlier announcement that The Weather Channel would be dropped, the channel was never officially removed from Dish Network. The Weather Cast was discontinued in anticipation of a Weatherscan-based service that would provide local weather information for Dish Network customers. The financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed at this time. =Fox dispute= A month-long negotiation between Dish and Fox over licensing fees took place in October 2010, with Dish Network temporarily losing FX, the National Geographic Channel, and regional FSN channels. The two companies gave divergent accounts of the negotiations: Dish claimed that Fox was seeking a 20 percent hike in licensing fees; Fox disputed the number. The parties settled on October 29, two days before their agreement was set to expire. Terms were not disclosed. For much of the summer of 2013, Dish, along with Time Warner Cable and DirecTV had been in a dispute whether to carry the new Fox Sports 1 formerly Speed, the new Fox Sports 2 formerly Fuel TV and the new FXX channel formerly Fox Soccer. On August 14, just three days before the launch of FS1, all three providers reached an agreement to carry those Fox channels. For two weeks ending October 6, 2019 Dish Network also had to remove Fox owned local channels due to an expired retransmission consent agreement. Fox News and Fox Affiliates in smaller markets were not included in the outage. =MSG Network dispute= On October 1, 2010, Dish Network subscribers lost the MSG and MSG Plus regional sports networks due to a contract dispute with Madison Square Garden, Inc. MSG called on Dish Network to resume negotiations and reconsider its proposals but there was still no agreement as of September 15, 2013. MSG is linking carriage of these networks to their sister network Fuse, which was replaced with Palladia in July 2010. However, in October 2012, Dish brought back Fuse, along with the AMC networks, so customers can enjoy both Fuse and Palladia. However, as of April 2017, Dish has not restored either MSG Network nor MSG Plus. =Belo Corp.= On October 29, 2010, it was announced that Belo Corporation and Dish Network were in a carriage dispute regarding rates. ABC affiliates WFAA in Dallas, Texas, KVUE in Austin, Texas, CBS affiliates KHOU in Houston, Texas, WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, Fox affiliate KMSB in Tucson, Arizona and 10 other local stations are affected. Two days later, both Belo and Dish Network reached an agreement, avoiding a service interruption. Belo had offered Dish Network an extension while negotiations were taking place. Had there been no agreement made by October 31 at midnight (all time zones), Belo would have pulled these channels from Dish Network.A WFAA message about Dish Network ‚Äì WFAA.com (released October 29, 2010) If the Fox Networks dispute would've continued throughout that time period, this combination would've created the biggest blow to Dish Network customers since Echostar's disagreement with CBS/Viacom in 2004. =SportsNet New York (SNY)= On April 1, 2011, Dish Network pulled SportsNet New York (which broadcasts New York Mets games) from its channel lineup due to a carriage dispute. As a result, Dish Network becomes the only satellite provider not to carry any Regional Sports Networks in the New York area. As of April 2017, Dish has still not returned SNY to its channel lineup. =Heritage Broadcasting Group of Michigan= On December 15, 2011, Dish Network pulled WWTV and WFQX, stations in the Northern Michigan television market owned by Heritage Broadcasting, citing \\"an outrageous fee increase\\". The dispute was resolved on December 20, restoring those two channels to the lineup. The same 2 channels were again pulled from the DISH Network lineup on May 28, 2015, due to another retransmission consent dispute, and were not restored for 3 months of being off the DISH lineup. =AMC Networks= On March 4, 2012, Dish Network announced that it would no longer carry the AMC Networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite provider's distribution agreement with the company at the end of June 2012, citing that AMC Networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels. AMC Networks responded to Dish's announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by former company parent Rainbow Media's Voom HD Networks, in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005, until May 12, 2008, when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup (the five remaining Voom HD channels were removed from Dish the day after). However, Dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms. On May 20, 2012, Dish Network removed Sundance Channel from its channel lineup. Two weeks later on June 4, 2012, Dish relocated AMC, WE tv, and IFC to higher channel positions with AMC being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds; the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with HDNet, Style and MoviePlex multiplex channel Indieplex. The move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a June 3 airing of an episode of Mad Men urging Dish Network customers to inform the company to keep the three AMC Networks channels on the satellite provider with Dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels' ratings.Dish Network Kicks AMC Networks Channels To Nosebleed Section Of The Dial, Deadline Hollywood, June 4, 2012. On June 30, 2012, Dish dropped the three AMC Networks properties, replacing AMC with HDNet movies, IFC with HDNet, and WE tv with Style. The move coincided with a new agreement between Dish and AT&T; U-verse. On July 12, 2012, AMC said in an e-mailed statement that it would stream over the Internet the season premiere of \\"Breaking Bad\\" to DISH customers. \\"Dish subscribers can register online starting July 13 for the show, which airs on July 15. We want to give Dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season.\\" On October 21, 2012, AMC Networks announced a settlement was reached between them, Cablevision and Dish in which Dish was forced to pay up to $700 Million in damages to Cablevision for damages from removing Voom owned channels off the Dish Lineup back in 2008, and in return Dish signed a new agreement to bring the AMC networks owned channels back on the Dish lineup with AMC returning October 21 and the rest on November 1st. Also, DISH simultaneously brought back FUSE, and all 4 channels were moved from \\"America's Top 200\\" to 120. =Big Ten Network= On August 27, 2012, Big Ten Network (BTN) and Dish Network (Dish) began a dispute over the extant contract. This contract expired on August 31, 2012, the day before the college football season started. On September 1, 2012, Big Ten Network and Dish Network entered into a short-term arrangement and avoided a blackout. By September 14, 2012, the parties had failed to reach further agreement and BTN was dropped from the Dish lineup. On September 22, 2012, the Big Ten Network and Dish reached an agreement, returning BTN to the Dish lineup. =Gannett Company= In October 2012, Gannett Company threatened to pull all 23 of its television stations (serving 19 U.S. markets) from Dish Network. Though retransmission consent compensation is an issue with the dispute, Gannett also demands that the satellite provider discontinue the AutoHop commercial- skipping feature on its digital video recorders.Fight over ad-skipping feature may lead to WTSP-Ch. 10's removal from DISH Network , Tampa Bay Times, October 4, 2012. Narrowly averting a blackout, Gannett Company reached a long-term carriage agreement with Dish Network for all 23 of its television stations to remain on the satellite provider. The deal was reached despite reported contentious demands reportedly made by Gannett for Dish to disable its AutoHop ad-skipping feature on its digital video recorders or pay a \\"massive penalty\\" of a 300% increase in carriage fees (claims that Gannett publicly denied).Dish, Gannett Reach New Retrans Deal to Avoid Blackout, The Hollywood Reporter, October 8, 2012. =WWE pay-per-view events= In September 2011, WWE announced it would launch its own 24/7 TV Network, the original plan was for the network to launch on April 1, 2012 to coincide with WrestleMania XXVII on several cable and satellite TV providers, however, Dish and its competition in the cable and satellite TV industry in the United States declined and it sat the network's launch two years back. Then on January 8, 2014 at a press conference for the Consumer Electronics Show, WWE announced that the WWE Network would launch as an Internet TV network with an on-demand streaming service similar to Netflix in which they also announced that all pay-per-view events starting with WrestleMania XXX would air on the network for free as part of the subscription to the network in which people would pay for it at a fixed price with a six-month commitment. This decision did not set in with all cable and satellite TV providers as this would devalue the monthly WWE pay per views as they charge a price that would be higher than what the monthly price of the online service would cost. DirecTV and Comcast had considered removing the pay per views from their lineup. It was revealed on February 19, days before the February pay-per-view event Elimination Chamber and the network's launch on the day after the pay per view that Dish would not carry Elimination Chamber and all WWE pay per view events from that point forward. Dish cited in a statement that \\"WWE has chosen to launch a 24/7 online network, without its TV partners, that includes all of its pay-per-view events. As WWE enters the increasingly fragmented media world by themselves, DISH will continue to consider the value of WWE pay-per-view on an event by event basis. DISH continues to provide a variety of WWE programming, including 'WWE Raw' on USA, 'WWE Smackdown' on Syfy, 'WWE Main Event' on Ion and 'WWE Total Divas\\" on E!. At this time, WWE pay-per-view events are not available on DISH\\". Meanwhile, WWE released a statement in response to Dish's decision to pull WWE pay per views in which WWE said \\"WWE is pleased that the majority of our cable and satellite pay-per-view distributors are giving our fans an option to purchase traditional Pay-Per-Views as we prepare to launch WWE Network on Monday, February 24. Unfortunately, Dish will not be doing so. We hope Dish will reconsider for this Sunday's 'Elimination Chamber' pay-per-view event and especially for 'WrestleMania 30.\\" Dish later made a decision to air Wrestlemania XXX. =Fox Sports South= In April 2013, Dish Network declined to pay Fox Sports for 47 Braves games. These games were acquired by Fox from WPCH-TV two months prior in February. Dish Network claimed it didn't want to pay a \\"significant\\" local surcharge, however, all others major providers (AT&T; U-verse, Xfinity, DirecTV, and Charter) agreed to FSS's terms. The dispute lasted three years until Fox and Dish Network finally came to terms on March 15, 2016, less than three weeks before the start of the 2016 season. =Hearst Television= On April 8, 2014 at 10pm EDT, Hearst Television forced Dish Network to remove its 29 stations off of the provider because they failed to reach a Retransmission consent agreement.

Dish removed CNN, HLN, Cartoon Network/Adult Swim, Boomerang, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, and CNN en Espa√±ol as the contract to carry those channels expired on October 20. TBS and TNT were not removed, as they are carried under a different contract. Dish pulled the channels without warning and Dish and Turner didn't let their customers know about the dispute before the expiration of their deal as normally Dish would warn about a potential channel removal.http://dishstandsforyou.com Dish replaced CNN and HLN with MSNBC, replaced Cartoon Network with Nicktoons (except for the West Feed which was replaced by a message about the removal of the channels), replaced Boomerang with Nick Jr., replaced Turner Classic Movies with FXM, and replaced TruTV with Esquire Network during the duration of the dispute.

Fox pointed out the recent pattern Dish had created with other networks. A deal was finally reached on January 14, 2015, with terms undisclosed. Update: The new deal is 1.50 for each subscriber on Dish Network, up 50% from the old deal of 1.00 per. =UFC pay-per-view events= On April 22, 2015, Ultimate Fighting Championship announced that Dish Network will not carry further pay-per-view events from the mixed martial arts promoter, starting with UFC 186, citing contractual issues. UFC advised Dish customers to subscribe to its UFC.TV over the top streaming service, or watch at a venue served by another television provider. According to a Dish representative, the company is still in negotiations with UFC for future event carriage. =Sinclair Broadcast Group= On August 25, 2015, Dish Network dropped 129 stations in 79 markets owned and/or operated by Sinclair Broadcast Group, in what has been called the largest single blackout in pay-TV history. Dish claims that Sinclair is strong-arming them into carrying a cable network Sinclair is looking to acquire in addition to the local stations. Sinclair has rebutted by stating that Dish is \\"trying to spin the facts in an apparent effort to make a political statement.\\" A day later, a new agreement was reached and the channels were restored. =Tegna, Inc.= On October 9, 2015, Tegna-owned 46 stations in 38 markets were blacked out after the two parties failed to come to an agreement.Tegna Blacks Out Dish Network Customers In 38 Markets - Deadline Hollywood (published October 9, 2015) This affected 9 markets where the Red River Showdown was airing Saturday October 10 on ABC affiliates, including WFAA in Dallas, KVUE in Austin, KIII in Corpus Christi and KBMT in Beaumont. It wasn't until Sunday, October 11 that TEGNA and Dish reached a new multi-year agreement to restore the channels. No terms have been disclosed, but it was noted that the NFL games scheduled to air that day on TEGNA's Fox, CBS and NBC affiliates helped the urgency of negotiations.Dish Network, Tegna Reach Deal Ending Blackout in 38 Markets - Variety (published October 11, 2015) =Tribune Broadcasting= Tribune Broadcasting announced that its 42 television stations in 33 markets and basic cable network WGN America were pulled from Dish Network on June 12 at 7 p.m. (Eastern) after the two sides failed to reach a new retransmission agreement.

This also impacts major market CW affiliates KDAF in Dallas, KIAH in Houston, WPIX in New York City, KTLA in Los Angeles, and Tribune's flagship WGN-TV in Chicago (which switched to being an independent station on September 1). Dish proposed having an arbitrator to settle the dispute. Meanwhile, Tribune proposed to have the FCC chairman monitor negotiations between the two companies.Dish Network Proposes Arbitration to Tribune in Fee Dispute - Wall Street Journal (published June 16, 2016) As the blackout reached its 2nd week, Dish sues Tribune over their \\"Dump Dish\\" campaign, accusing them of deceptive claims about worst customer service and hindering contracts with its customers, damaging the provider's good reputation.Dish Network Sues Tribune Over ‚ÄòDump Dish‚Äô Campaign as Blackout Stretches Into Week Two - Variety Tribune responded to said lawsuit calling it \\"frivolous\\", and stated that they \\"repeatedly offered Dish an extension through August 31, 2016, which Dish has continually rejected.\\" Throughout this spat, Dish customers in markets affected also missed out on Games 5, 6, and 7 of a historic 2016 NBA Finals and Game 6 of the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals on Tribune-owned ABC and NBC affiliates respectively.Tribune Broadcasting Responds to Frivolous Lawsuit Filed by Dish Network - PR Newswire (published June 21, 2015) Dish Chairman and CEO Charlie Ergen said that the satellite distributor is prepared for the long-haul, adding that if necessary he could do without the channels indefinitely. Ergen also states that the longer this dispute continues, the less valuable the Tribune stations and cabler WGN America will be.Ergen: Dish Prepared To Do Without Tribune Stations - Multichannel News (published July 21, 2016) As the blackout continued through August, customers in affected markets already missed NBC's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics in its entirety on its Tribune-owned affiliates, although NBC's sister cable networks were also showing select events. They also missed most of the NFL Preseason games on its CBS and Fox affiliates.Tribune Blitzes Dish with NFL Blackout Spots - Broadcasting & Cable (Published August 2, 2016) It wasn't until September 4, 2016, when the 2 parties finally came to an agreement to make Tribune's stations and WGN America available again to Dish customers. The terms of such have not been disclosed.DISH and Tribune Broadcasting Reach Agreement on Carriage and Retransmission Consent - PR Newswire (published September 4, 2016) Lawsuits On May 24, 2012, Dish and the networks filed suit in federal court, the Dish case in Manhattan and the networks' cases in Los Angeles. On May 30, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled the networks' cases should not be filed in Los Angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to New York. On July 9 preliminary judgement, Swain denied Dish's request to set aside the issue of copyright violation, ruling that Dish's argument lacked specificity. She also ruled that the case could be heard in Los Angeles, thereby eliminating New York as a potential venue. On November 7, 2012, the United States District Court for the Central District of California denied Fox's motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because (1) PTAT and AutoHop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract; and (2) while QA copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract, the harm from the copies was not irreparable but was compensable with money. Fox appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 24, 2013, the Ninth Circuit reviewed the district court's decision with a very deferential standard of review, and affirmed it. =TiVo patent lawsuit= On June 3, 2009, satellite service provider EchoStar was found by Marshall, Texas, federal district court judge David Folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of TiVo's technology and was required to pay the DVR pioneer $103.1 million plus interest. On May 3, 2011, DISH Network Corporation and EchoStar Corporation agreed to pay TiVo Inc. $500 million to settle a dispute over the use of some of TiVo's technology. This lawsuit took more than ten years to resolve. One of the judges involved said that the conduct of DISH's lawyers didn't \\"even meet law-school student behavior,\\" and \\"presented the saddest day I have seen in my many years in court.\\" Work environment DISH fired a quadriplegic wheelchair user, Brandon Coats, from his job as a telephone operator in 2010 for using medical-marijuana during off-work hours. Coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms. His paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash. After Coats failed a random drug test, he sued, claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee. His suit relied under a Colorado law called the Lawful Off-Duty Activities Statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time. The trial court and Colorado Court of Appeals ruled in Coats v. DISH Network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law. The trial court ruled that Coats should have to pay DISH's legal fees; the appeals court overturned this ruling.

Frequency acquisition subsidies DISH Network received about $3 billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth. DISH Network used the 1934 Federal Communications Act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the January 2015 auction of wireless spectrum. Under the terms of that act, \\"designated entities\\" qualify for a 25 percent discount on the market price of such licenses. DISH used small subsidiaries such as Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless in order to qualify. DISH only paid $10 billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost $13 billion. The difference would have been paid to the federal government. The FEC and the United States Senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints. Related party transactions In 2012, DISH invested $500,000 in a technology startup, Yottabyte Ventures LLC, in which Christoper Ergen, the son of CEO Charlie Ergen, has 7.1 percent equity. Yottabytes develops mobile video applications. At the end of 2012, DISH held 71.4% of that company's equity. In 2011, DISH paid $100,000 to an online marketing company that Chase Ergen, another son of Charlie Ergen, owns 50% of. As part of a reseller agreement, DISH paid another firm owned by Chase Ergen $101,000 during 2010 and 2011. Candy Ergen, Charlie Ergen's wife, is paid between $100,000 to $110,000 per year in consulting fees. Other unnamed children of Ergen received about $25,000 in 2010 and 2011. These transactions were criticized by shareholder advocates due to the potential conflict of interests. Investor relations It is alleged that DISH treats analysts and major shareholders poorly. They have been accused of being uncooperative with investors and analysts. These allegations have included not meeting with investors and analysts. They have also been accused of sending out late press releases that are too late to be actionable References Category:Criticisms of companies Criticism of Dish Network ","title":"Criticism of Dish Network"},{"id":"39805284","text":"Earl Leroy \\"Buddy\\" Carter (born September 6, 1957) is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Georgia's 1st congressional district since 2015.

He sat on the Senate Appropriations, Health and Human Services, Higher Education, and Public Safety committees. In March 2014, a controversy emerged regarding S.B. 408, a bill authored by Carter that would increase reimbursement rates for pharmacies in Georgia. As he is the owner of three pharmacies which would see increased profits as a result of the proposed action, his vote was considered by many to be in violation of the ethical guidelines of the State Senate. \\"Obviously, it's borderline,\\" he admitted when questioned afterwards. Carter gave up his state house seat in 2014 to make a run for Congress after 22-year incumbent Jack Kingston announced he was running for the United States Senate. He finished first in the six-way Republican primary with 36 percent of the vote, well short of the 51 percent required for outright victory. He then defeated Bob Johnson in the runoff with 53 percent of the vote. In the general election, he trounced his Democratic challenger, Brian Reese, with 60.9 percent of the vote, carrying all but two counties in the district.

In 2017, Carter renewed his push to drug test citizens who receive unemployment insurance. =Health care= Carter supports the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He has stated that there is no circumstance that would induce him to vote in favor of keeping the ACA, including if most of his constituents were in favor of it. On July 26, 2017, Carter was asked during a live television interview if he supported Trump's criticism of Republican U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski for her opposition to the procedural vote to begin the Senate's healthcare debate. Carter agreed with the criticism, saying, \\"Somebody needs to go over there to that Senate and snatch a knot in their ass.\\"GOP lawmaker on Murkowski: 'Snatch a knot in their ass' Julia Manchester.

Retrieved July 28, 2017. = Tax reform = Carter voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. His reason for voting \\"Yea\\" on the bill was that he believed businesses located in his district would become more competitive in a global market. He also said it would help his constituents earn and/or save more money. =Immigration= Carter has stated that \\"granting amnesty to illegal immigrants is unconstitutional.\\" However, he has co-sponsored a bill which would let illegal immigrants serve in the US military in exchange for legal residency. Carter supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration from six countries until better screening methods are devised. He stated that \\"While I believe there needs to be thoughtful clarifications on the executive actions similar to Secretary Kelly‚Äôs announcement about lawful permanent residents, the number one priority of the federal government is to provide for the common defense.\\" Carter wants to prohibit all federal funding from sanctuary cities in Georgia (sanctuary cities prohibit city officials from asking about a person's immigration status when they're reporting an unrelated crime). Carter also stated he would like to test the huge backlog of rape kits in Georgia, except in sanctuary cities. He said about testing the rape kit backlog, \\"We'll do everything we can to help,\\" but then added, \\"Unless they‚Äôre a sanctuary city.\\" = Abortion = Carter opposes abortion. He cosponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act (H.R. 586), which would make all abortions illegal. H.R. 586 provides a constitutional right to life to embryos at the moment of fertilization. While a similar bill in the Senate, S. 231, claims to not target women who use birth control, women who suffer from miscarriages, or families that want to conceive using vitro fertilization, the House bill contains no such exceptions. When asked by a constituent during a town hall in Savannah, Georgia whether he had concerns about restricting access to birth control when rape is so common on college campuses, Carter replied \\"I'm not going to vote for any bill that endorses abortion.\\" H.R. 586, which would ban abortion, contains no exceptions for the life or health of the mother or for cases of rape or incest. =Education= When questioned during a February 2017 town hall in Savannah, Georgia as to whether religious doctrine ought to be taught in public school science classes, Carter responded \\"I have always thought we should teach the Bible in school.\\" =LGBT rights= Carter believes gay marriage should be illegal. During an August 2017 town hall in Brunswick, Georgia, Carter stated that he supported a ban on transgender people serving in the military, saying, \\"I don't want 'em serving in the military. I'm sorry.\\" = Gun rights = Carter is a strong supporter of gun rights, and has an \\"A\\" rating from the National Rifle Association for his stances on gun issues. In 2018, Carter stated: \\"I support the 2nd Amendment so I don't want to see us outlawing anything. However, however I will say that I have recently come out and said I am against bump stocks.\\" (Bump stocks are what allowed the shooter in the Las Vegas Massacre to fire more rapidly than semi-automatic weapons normally do.) \\"Automatic weapons are against the law here in America and a bump stock in my opinion is nothing more than an attempt to circumvent the law so I don't think that we should have those,\\" said Carter. \\"But you know at the same time people have the right to bear arms, it's the 2nd Amendment,\\" Carter reiterated. \\"And you know even if you were to outlaw some of these semi-automatic weapons they're going to get a get a weapon from somewhere,\\" he said. In February 2018 during a town hall in Hinesville, Georgia when asked about mass shootings in America, Carter told attendees to not look towards Congress for answers about gun violence, stating Congress is not responsible for gun violence in America. Bills introduced and signed into law The GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017 (,), which was one of the first Acts of the 115th United States Congress signed into law by President Trump during the first 100 days of his presidency, was introduced to the House by Carter on January 1, 2017. It passed through the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and was passed by the full Senate, on January 17, 2017. It was signed by Trump on January 31, 2017. The bill ensures that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has full access to a database created by Congress in 1996 to track recent job hires mainly to assist agencies at the state level with child support enforcement. 115-3 will enable the GAO to ensure that recipients of federal means-tested programs like Unemployment Insurance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Earned income tax credit (EITC), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) are eligible.

It is located on Christie Street, the first street in the world to be lit up by lightbulb, just off Lincoln Highway, near the Metropark Train Station. It covers a total area of . The park commemorates the site where the famous inventor Thomas Alva Edison had his Menlo Park laboratory. In his laboratory, Edison invented over 600 inventions such as the incandescent electric light and the phonograph, the latter being the first object to record and play sound. History The research and development laboratory in Menlo Park was the first of its kind in the world. On October 22, 1879, Thomas Edison tested a bamboo filament which lasted over 30 hours, which was used to create the first successful incandescent light bulb. This accomplishment followed Edison's testing of over a thousand filaments in six months. 3 years earlier, Thomas Edison tested his wax and tinfoil phonograph by recording and playing \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\\" Thomas Edison improved Alexander Graham Bell's telephone using carbon. In addition, he invented an electric train and tested it on a track built around his laboratory, now coinciding with modern day Christie Street and Route 27. In 1887, when Thomas Edison needed a bigger laboratory closer to New York City, he moved his research laboratory to West Orange, New Jersey. Most of the buildings either burned down or collapsed, and the two surviving buildings, the glass shed and the Sarah Jordan Boarding House were moved by Henry Ford in 1929 to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan, now part of The Henry Ford museum. The remaining structure from the other buildings was used by Henry Ford to rebuild them in Greenfield Village, where they are still open today. Despite the fact that Edison's laboratory had fully been relocated, on May 16, 1925, John Leib, vice president of the New York Edison Company, dedicated a stone tablet and memorial at the intersection of Christie Street and Route 27 (Lincoln Highway), a gift from the State of New Jersey, with Edison, his wife Edison, and Governor George S. Silzer attending the event. On May 17th, 1937, construction began on a new monument to Edison, the Edison Tower. On February 11, 1938, 7 years after Edison's death, a tall Art Deco tower was dedicated in honor of the Wizard of Menlo Park. Today There is also a small, two room museum with a collection of Edison memorabilia such as historic light bulbs, phonographs, dynamos and portions of Edison's electric train test track. Tours are available for free but the Edison Tower Memorial Corporation recommends visitors to donate at least $5.00 per person. Souvenirs are also available at the museum. After it was put on the list of New Jersey's most endangered historic sites in 1997 (the tower was closed in 1992 after slabs of concrete started falling from the 54-year-old freestanding structure), the Edison Township Memorial Corporation started a $3.875 million renovation. On October 24th, 2015, the end of the restoration was marked by a rededication ceremony which included the relighting of the tower. In the future, there are plans to build a new, larger museum featuring many hands-on activities, and exhibits with artifacts. Surrounding the two historic acres is a small forest with a couple of trails. The forest contains a small pond, a meadow, and several ravines which are visible from the trail. On Christie Street, the world's first street lit by electric lights, there are several informative boards describing Menlo Park in the Edison Era.

It was founded in 1949 by Rudolf von Beckerath (born 19 February 1907 in Munich, died 22 November 1976). History Rudolf von Beckerath was born in 1907 in Munich, the son of a painter and a pianist. Soon after his birth his parents moved to Hamburg. There he went to school and began training as a mechanical engineer, but then switched to organ building, being impressed by organs built by Arp Schnitger. On the recommendation of Hans Henny Jahnn, he finally went to France in 1929 to put the necessary finishing touches on his training at Victor Gonzales' organ-building in Ch√¢tillon-sous-Bagneux, near Paris. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked for a brief time with Frobenius Orgelbyggeri in Denmark, where he took part in building the great organ of the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen. In 1931 Gonzales asked him to return, and he became a partner in the company. However, in 1935, as a result of the French sanctions against German businesses and business people, he parted amicably from the Paris company and returned to Germany. There he initially worked as an independent consultant in Hamburg, designing the organ for the Christuskirche (Christ Church) in Othmarschen. In 1938 he was appointed to an official position advising on organs and bells for the Reich Ministry for Ecclesiastical Affairs and in 1939 moved to Berlin. In 1941 he was called up for military service in the Wehrmacht and in 1945 was captured by the Americans. Released in May 1946, he first returned to Munich, and resumed working as an organ consultant. His reports on numerous organs in North Germany in the post-war period are valuable documentation. However, in 1949, he finally succeeded after many difficulties in passing his master's examination, required for him to work independently as an organ builder. His international career began in the 1950s. Rudolf von Beckerath died in 1976 and the business was converted into a limited liability company headed by his wife and closest associates. Managing directors Helmut Kleemann and Herta Deichmann retired in 1987 and 1990 respectively, and Timm Sckopp, a former apprentice of von Beckerath, took over the management of the company. In 1995, von Beckerath's widow Veronika gave up control of the company: Sckopp handed over the organ-building division to Rolf Miehl, and Holger Redlich took over the business aspect. Both had been members of the board since 1995. In 2001, with assistance from the investor Whitney Reader, they bought out the business.

Originally built as a poor house by the Belfast Charitable Institution. Today it is houses a heritage centre alongside a residential home and sheltered accommodation apartments. Foundation The Belfast Charitable Society was founded in August 1752, with the aim of setting up a poorhouse and a charitable hospital infirmary. The Society was financed by subscriptions collected from leading inhabitants of the then town of Belfast, and a nationwide lottery. After over 20 years, land was donated by Arthur Chichester, the first Marquess of Donegall to the north of the town, and a plan was drawn up by Mr Cooley for a combined 36 person poorhouse and 24 bed infirmary, estimated at ¬£3,000 to construct. In the centre of the final approved design were large assembly rooms. The foundation stone was laid on 7 August 1771, with the building opening on 17 September 1774. History Quickly becoming full and continually operating at full capacity, the Society agreed in March 1800 to permit Dr William Haliday to try the first trials of inoculation and vaccination in Ireland. Subject to the condition of approval of their parents, poorhouse children were given vaccinations to protect them against diseases. The funds generated allowed the building to be extended, adding a lunatic ward. Doctor William Drennan, although never one of the Poor House's physicians, was a strong supporter of the Belfast Charitable Society, and gave sound medical advice, especially on the advantages of public inoculation against small pox to the Board. Drennan lodged in the house of Henry Joy McCracken and Mary Ann McCracken who had strong links to the Society. Edward Bunting (1773‚Äì1843), an Irish musician and folk music collector, asked the Committee to support him in organising a festival, the proceeds of which were donated to the Charitable Society. A small sub-group of the Society's committee went to England to establish high-value trades which the poor should be trained in, and having studied the Lancashire cotton trade, came back to Belfast with the plan of training all inmates in the skills of the same industry. Hence training was set up on weaving, spinning, knitting, and net-making. The result was the foundation of Belfast's cotton industry. Present After Belfast Charitable Society celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2002, it decided to build a new nursing home at Carlisle Circus. This allowed them to lease Clifton House to Helm Housing Association for 75 years, allowing funding of required renovation work.Belfast Charitable Institution (Clifton House), Clifton Street, Belfast: Historic Building Details. Northern Ireland Buildings Database. Northern Ireland Environment Agency. Retrieved 30 June 2010. Clifton House is now shared by Helm who operate sheltered accommodation, and the Society who run an old persons home.

H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs (October 1, 1911 - May 14, 1985), was a lawyer and politician from Alexandria, Louisiana, who served as a Democratic member in both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature. He was a state senator during the final two terms of the Earl Kemp Long administration, 1948 to 1952 and 1956 to 1960. He was Long's senatorial floor leader and later a key player in the administration of another Long faction governor, John J. McKeithen. Background Born in 1911, C. H. Downs, known as \\"Sammy\\", was one of seven children from the 1900 marriage of the former Callie McCann (died 1983) and U. T. Downs, a native of LaSalle Parish. Sammy Downs was born in his mother's native community of Effie in Avoyelles Parish, south of Rapides Parish. He is named for his paternal great-grandfather, Crawford Downs, originally from Mississippi. His maternal great-grandfather, Uriah Whatley, came to Louisiana about 1812 as a Methodist circuit preacher. U. T. Downs, a businessman, served two terms and a portion of a third as the mayor of Pineville, located on the eastern side of the Red River across from Alexandria. In 1924, Downs was elected Sheriff of Rapides Parish, a post which he held for sixteen years. In the 1920s, Sheriff U. T. Downs, a Southern Baptist, had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan, which had enjoyed a revival after 1915. When the organization folded its Rapides Parish chapter after a national scandal, he joined a still functioning KKK unit in Atlanta, Georgia.Henry E. Chambers, A History of Louisiana: Wilderness, Colony, Province, Territory, State, People, (Chicago and New York City: American Historical Society, Inc., 1925), pp. 245-246 C. H. Downs graduated in 1932 from the Southern Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College, a secondary school in Pineville; he was president of the senior class. In 1933, he graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Career From 1933 to 1939, Downs worked as a teacher and coach at Glenmora High School in Glenmora in south Rapides Parish. From 1939 to 1944, he served as principal at Cheneyville High School in Cheneyville, also in south Rapides Parish. In 1941, principal Downs was elected president of the Louisiana Teachers Association. > As long as people run for government office, you will have indictments, > stealing, and the like. - said the educator-turned-lawyer, Democrat C. H. > \\"Sammy\\" Downs In November 1939, his father, U. T. Downs, and three of his deputies: W. C. Nash, N. G. Aymond, and Roy Yerby, were among nineteen persons named in sixty- six indictments by a Rapides Parish grand jury. The four men from the sheriff's department were charged with malfeasance in office. Other men faced charges for bribery, embezzlement, and income tax violations. Mayors V. V. Lamkin of Alexandria, an Earl Long supporter, was charged with bribery and malfeasance in office. Mayor Rollo C. Lawrence of Pineville and State Representative Richmond C. Hathorn were indicted for dual-officeholding, or being \\"deadheads\\" on the state payroll. Other indictments were issued against George C. Gray, the former Alexandria chief of police and a candidate to succeed Downs as sheriff, and Alexandria police officers Allen E. Zachary and Joseph T. Ohman. Downs entered state politics and was elected in 1944 as a Democratic state representative. While still serving, he completed his law degree, which he received in 1946 at the age of thirty-five from LSU's Paul M. Hebert Law Center in Baton Rouge. Downs was a member of the Masonic lodge, the Chamber of Commerce, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. Like his parents, he belonged to the First Baptist Church of Pineville, Louisiana. Political career Downs was first elected in 1944 at the age of thirty- three to one of three at-large seats in the Louisiana House from Rapides Parish. In contrast to single-member districts, these seats required candidates to gain a majority of votes across the parish. Downs' tenure coincided with the first administration of Governor Jimmie Davis, and he served alongside future Alexandria Mayor Carl B. Close. In 1948, Downs moved up to the state Senate; also elected were Earl Long as governor, Bill Dodd as lieutenant governor, and Bolivar Edwards Kemp, Jr., as attorney general. After a four-year absence, Downs returned to the Senate in 1956 for his second term by defeating fellow Democratic State Representative Cecil R. Blair, an Alexandria businessman allied with the anti-Long faction of Louisiana politics. In 1959, however, with anti-Long sentiment running strongly statewide, Blair unseated Downs.The Shreveport Times, December 6, 1959, p. 1 Blair held the seat until 1964, when he was defeated after one term. Blair was re-elected in 1965, and served after that in the state senate from 1966 to 1976. After Downs left the state Senate, he joined the group working for Earl Long's election in 1960 for the vacant seat in Louisiana's 8th congressional district. (This has since been redistricted.) Others on the bandwagon were Bill Dodd, Sixty Rayburn, Long attorney Joseph A. Sims, and A. A. Fredericks, Long's former executive assistant and another former state senator from Natchitoches. While Long defeated the short-term incumbent, Harold B. McSween of Alexandria, for the Democratic nomination for the House, he died before he could take his seat. McSween won the ensuing special election for the term ending on January 3, 1963. In the spring of 1964, Downs was the chairman of the Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee, in which capacity he largely allied himself with Leander Perez, the political boss of Plaquemines Parish and the leader of the forces opposed to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, then seeking a full term in office. Perez at first pushed for Democratic electors pledged to George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, but he later abandoned that approach and endorsed Republican Barry M. Goldwater. Downs resigned from the Democratic party chairmanship in December 1966 and was succeeded by Edward M. Carmouche, a Lake Charles attorney backed by the loyalists who favored another term for President Johnson, who soon took himself out of contention for reelection. Carmouche defeated, fifty-four to thirty-eight, the Perez- backed W. L. \\"Jack\\" Howard, the mayor of Monroe, who in 1964 had been among the list of Democratic defectors to Goldwater.Biloxi Daily Herald, December 24, 1966, p. 14 Downs joined the administration of John McKeithen in the spring of 1964. The two had served together in the legislature from 1948 to 1952; McKeithen, as a state representative from Caldwell Parish and Downs, as senator from Rapides Parish. Downs was the master of ceremonies at the McKeithen inauguration. He left the administration in 1965 but remained an unpaid advisor to McKeithen. Downs once remarked, rather nonchalantly, that political corruption is common in Louisiana and would likely remain so: \\"As long as people run for government office, you will have indictments, stealing, and the like.\\" He made the statement in 1972 after appearing before a federal grand jury which investigated allegations of kickbacks in the Louisiana state insurance program. Downs indicated that he had never taken insurance commissions.\\"'As Long As People Run, Stealing Will Occur,' Says Downs\\", Minden Press-Herald, March 30, 1972, p. 1 When Life Magazine reported the strong influence of organized crime on Louisiana state government, a defensive McKeithen named Camille Gravel, another Alexandria lawyer, to head an investigation into the question. Gravel soon resigned in outrage when the investigation was stopped after Downs became the target. Downs' private telephone in the capitol, kept in a \\"locked box\\" and available only to him, allegedly kept the governor's office in contact with Mafia kingpins. Without Gravel, the investigation continued during 1966 under the supervision of Sargent Pitcher, then the district attorney of East Baton Rouge Parish. It was revealed that Downs had been in communication with the New Orleans crime family boss Carlos Marcello regarding a real estate transaction in Alexandria, but no allegation of wrongdoing came forth on the matter. Pitcher also found no link between Marcello and another former McKeithen aide, Aubrey W. Young, other than two telephone calls to which Young admitted, one of which concerned what became the Louisiana Superdome. Despite Pitcher's report, McKeithen still described Downs as \\"the only Mafia link I know of in my administration.\\" In 1968, Downs joined the presidential campaign of American Independent Party nominee George Wallace, who after having withdrawn from consideration in 1964, hoped without success to deny Richard M. Nixon and Hubert H. Humphrey an electoral college majority. McKeithen, however, had supported Humphrey at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Afterwards, Downs returned to the McKeithen administration as executive counsel, the Mafia link apparently overlooked or discounted. In 1969, McKeithen named Downs director of public works.Life Magazine (Vol. 68, No. 13), p. 53 Downs was suspended by Governor McKeithen as the public works director early in 1972 after indictment by a federal grand jury for taking bribes from the Shoup Voting Machine Company\\"McKeithen Suspends Public Works Head,\\" Minden Press-Herald, February 1, 1972, p. 1. Downs soon resigned from the administration, and the Shoup company was also indicted in the case. In the 1973 trial, the case against Downs resulted in a hung jury. Family legacy Downs married the former Alice Daigre (1914-1994), a sister of the Alexandria consulting engineer Louis Jacob Daigre, Jr. They had a son, James Crawford Downs, known as Jam Downs, and two daughters together before their divorce. Alice Downs and six employees of the Louisiana State Department of Education were indicted on fraud charges brought forward after an investigation of the vocational rehabilitation department, which receives federal funding.

Lewis was the longtime voice of Chiquita Banana in that company's animated ad campaign, beginning in 1947. Biography =Early life= Lewis was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States on May 22, 1922, the youngest of three children. Her father, Leon, was a pianist, musical director for CBS, and composer while her mother, Jessica, was a singer with the Chicago Opera Company, with Lewis studying voice with her mother. At the age of 11, Lewis' family moved to New York City due to The Great Depression. =Career= Lewis began singing on radio after a successful audition with WMCA in New York City led to her own program. While studying at Hunter College at the age of seventeen, she started working as a singer for a radio show called Gloom Dodgers in order to support her family. Shortly after working for Gloom Dodgers, Lewis had a radio show titled Monica Makes Music. She went on to co-star on The Chesterfield Supper Club on radio. She won a part as a singing cigarette girl in the Broadway show Johnny 2X4. Lewis' work on Broadway led to performing at the Stork Club and leaving school; she changed her name from May to Monica because she thought it was \\"sexier\\", telling The New York Times that \\"I feel much more like Monica and I look much more like Monica, too\\". In 1943, jazz pianist Leonard Feather told Lewis that bandleader Benny Goodman needed a singer since Peggy Lee had left upon marrying his band's guitarist, Dave Barbour. At an audition in Times Square with hundreds of women participating, Lewis earned the part as a singer and began to sing on Hotel Astor's roof with Goodman's orchestra. With the help of Goodman she began to establish her career through nationally broadcast shows such as The Revere Camera Show and Beat the Band. Lewis was dubbed \\"America‚Äôs Singing Sweetheart\\" during this time. Some of her songs included \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\", \\"I Wish You Love\\", and \\"Autumn Leaves.\\" However, Lewis' parents did not allow her to perform in out-of-town tours. For a short time, Lewis participated in advertisements for companies such as Burlington Mills and Camel cigarettes. In 1947, Lewis began to provide the singing voice for \\"Miss Chiquita Banana\\", a cartoon television commercial character. In 1948 she appeared in the first ever Ed Sullivan Show, which was created and produced by her brother Marlo Lewis. In 1950, she was signed to a contract with MGM. Some of her films included The Strip, Everything I Have Is Yours, and Affair with a Stranger, ‚Äò ‚ÄòThe D.I‚Äô‚Äô, and she later appeared in some 1970s disaster films such as Earthquake (1974), Rollercoaster (1977), and both Airport '77 (1977) and The Concorde ... Airport '79 (1979). She also from the 1950s to the 1980s made appearances in several television action series, including Those Whiting Girls, Peter Gunn, Johnny Staccato, The Virginian and Ironside. She spoke about her career just 10 days before her death to The New Yorker magazine, in an article published in the September 7, 2015 edition =Personal life= Lewis was married twice. Her first husband was the American record producer Bob Thiele. They married in 1945 but divorced a couple of years later. She moved to Beverly Hills, California in the 1950s. In 1956, she married film producer Jennings Lang and they remained together until his death in 1996. They had three children. Her sister Barbara was a pianist and her brother Marlo worked as a television producer. In her 2011 memoir Hollywood Through My Eyes, Lewis revealed that actor (and future U.S. President) Ronald Reagan had proposed to her. However, Lewis declined Reagan's marriage proposal. Monica Lewis died of natural causes at the age of 93 on June 12, 2015 at her home in Woodland Hills, California.

Conservator of Scottish trading privileges Andrew Halyburton was stationed at Middelburg in Flanders where he was 'Conservator of the Scottish Staple,' or 'Conservator of the Scottish privileges in the Low Countries.' A surviving letter in French calls him, 'Conservateur de la Nasion des Eschosoys a Midelburg.'C. Innes, ed., Ledger of Andrew Halyburton (Edinburgh, 1867), p. xx & illustrated frontispiece. This consular role administered to the Scottish import and export trade with the county of Flanders. However, few official Scottish or Flemish records of Andrew's administration survive.J. Davidson & A. Gray, Scottish Staple at Veere, (London, Longmans, 1909), pp. 137, 173, 363 In two letters to the town of Middelburg James IV of Scotland called Andrew 'our merchant' and 'the King's familiar servant,' and 'privilegiorum nationis in istis terris conservator,' - conservator of our nation's privileges in your lands. The letters reminded the council of Middelburg of Andrew's jurisdictions over Scottish trade issues, and how he should speak in their courts on behalf of Scottish sailors and captains.H. J.

One of Andrew's ledgers survives in which he recorded a series of accounts he opened with Scottish clients who sent money and goods to him in Flanders, often to fund special purchases. Some of the cargoes were carried in the ships of Andrew Barton of Leith.C.

Archibald, 'Coinage in Andrew Halyburton's Ledger,' in, Studies in Numismatic Method, Presented to Philip Grierson, (Cambridge, 1983), pp. 263-302. Primarily, Andrew's clients sent him wool or skins to sell. A letter from Andrew to a Scottish client survived with the ledger, advising hides would sell best at Eastertide 1502; he wrote, > \\"Thar standis yet ii sekkis of woll of youris unsauld, and quhen thai are > sauld, I shall send you your reckoning of all things between us. ... Please > you to wit that here is an evil mercat, sa help me God, except your woll, > ...

Halyburton also commissioned two carved stone tomb sculptures for the Duke, which he called 'throwchts.'A 'through-stone' was a grave slab, and the word also meant in the Scots language of the time a sheet of paper: Oxford English Dictionary; 'through stone,' 'through n.,' 'throuch, Scots n.' Andrew sent the stones to Veere in a barge he called a Schout, from where they were shipped to Scotland.Ledger, p. lix, 214-8 Andrew bought painting materials in Antwerp for an Edinburgh merchant, Thomas Cant, in June 1497. Thomas Cant had sold cloth, clothes, and hats to the royal wardrobe since 1474, and Master John Cant, probably his son, bought a Mass book for Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland.Accounts Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), p. 39.

Cornelia's younger brothers were the painters Simon Bening (1483‚Äì1561) father of Levina, and Paul Bening. It has been tentatively suggested that the painters in Scotland called 'Binning' during the sixteenth century were connections of the Flemish Bening family.David McRoberts, 'NOTES ON SCOTO-FLEMISH ARTISTIC CONTACTS,' Innes Review, 10 (Spring 1959), pp. 91-96. Andrew and Cornelia's children included a son Thomas and a daughter Cornelias. Andrew Halyburton was also well-connected in the close-knit society of Edinburgh merchants.

EnterpriseWorks, the Research Park's 43,000-square-foot business incubator for early-stage tech firms, is operated by the University of Illinois to help launch successful startup companies. History I-Hotel located within Research Park in Champaign, Illinois Research Park gained the approval of the Board of Trustees in November 1999 and established its governance with the University of Illinois Research Park Limited Liability Company in March 2000. The Research Park opened its first building in 2001 and grew into a 200-acre technology hub for corporate research and development operations. In 2003, the State of Illinois provided funding to build the EnterpriseWorks Incubator, a 43,000 square-foot business technology incubator for early-stage tech firms, and the first tenants moved in during early 2004. In May 2000, the University entered into a partnership with Fox/Atkins who now leases the land from the University and constructs customized buildings for Research Park's tenants. The company is responsible for transforming the land from fish ponds, agricultural fields, and livestock barns. By 2004, the Research Park hosted 35 tenants, 702 employees and 5 buildings. New Developments The next phase of development in the new master developer agreement is to add 160 acres of additional land east of the main Research Park area. The total operation in Research Park annually contributes $4.1 million in tax revenues to the state of Illinois. The total construction over 10 years contributed $7.2 million in state tax revenue. The Research Park Master Plan, adopted in September 2018 by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees, aims to double its size and continue attracting more companies, employees, and private development. This vision is a concept for a new building that would address two known factors impacting the future growth of the Research Park. The first being a lack of adequate lab facilities for growth-stage startup companies, in the community and throughout the state of Illinois; secondly, the need for additional Research Park community spaces providing an environment for creative collisions between the companies, employees, and faculty. EnterpriseWorks Incubator EnterpriseWorks Incubator located in the University of Illinois Research Park The EnterpriseWorks Incubator provides a bridge between the research of the University and the commercialization of technology by university faculty, researchers, and students. The award-winning incubator provides free counseling services to technology entrepreneurs and facilities such as laboratories, offices, conference rooms, kitchen, and co-working space. The Entrepreneur-in-Residence program is a free service provided by Research Park which consists of 7 experience tech entrepreneurs who provide monthly consulting to new startup ventures and prospective entrepreneurs. Research Park and the EnterpriseWorks Incubator hold educational, training, social, and networking events to facilitate a community feel while providing a place where the newest startups have the opportunity to develop relationships with established national and international corporations. The incubator has basic labs as well as full fit-out labs for chemical and life science companies. All leases in EnterpriseWorks last one year; renewal is based on company progress and the continued need for services. In addition to office and lab space, EnterpriseWorks offers complementary conference room space to its tenants. Rooms for groups from six to 30 persons are available by reservation. Kitchen and vending services are also on-site.

Vela Guti√©rrez (died 1160) was a Leonese nobleman. He first founded the convent of Santa Mar√≠a de Nogales in 1150, but it failed and was re-founded as a monastery at later date. Vela was a son of Count Gutierre Verm√∫dez. Highly unusually for the son of a count in twelfth- century Le√≥n, he never attained the rank of count himself.Barton, 30‚Äì31. He was addressed only as \\"my knight\\" (militi meo) on 14 May 1149, when the Emperor Alfonso VII granted him the village of Morales del Rey with the territory of Nogales in hereditary right \\"with all its appurtenances ... for his services\\" (cum toto eius honore ... pro servitio).Barton, 34; Reilly, 235‚Äì36; Y√°√±ez Neira, 502. This likely indicates that he was then serving in the royal military household, it may also indicate that he himself was knighted by Alfonso.Barton, 161; Y√°√±ez Neira, 502. After the knighting of the emperor's second son, Fernando, Vela was appointed to serve as his majordomo.Reilly, 145. Vela married Sancha Ponce de Cabrera, daughter of Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera. He adopted the arms of her family and had them displayed on the tombs of himself and his wife in the monastery of Nogales.Barton, 45, citing E. Fern√°ndez-Xesta y V√°zquez, \\"De cu√°ndo y d√≥nde naci√≥ el uso de la cabra como signo distintivo en el linaje de los vizcondes de Cabrera\\", Hidalgu√≠a 33 (1985), 820. Vela and Sancha donated some houses they owned in the city of Le√≥n to the monastery of Vega.Barton, 209; Reilly, 192. Beginning sometime after 23 April 1148, probably in 1149, he ruled the fief of La Cabrera, which was granted him by the Crown probably at the request of his father-in-law, who had ceded it for just this purpose, probably to serve as a wedding gift.Barton, 109. For a map showing the location of the tenancy of Cabrera relative to the other major tenancies of Le√≥n c.1150, cf. Barton, 88. Vela governed the territory until sometime before 29 September 1156, when it had passed back to Ponce Giraldo.Barton, 109 n32. In April 1150 Vela and Sancha founded a Benedictine nunnery at Nogales with some nuns from the Galician house of San Miguel de B√≥veda, then just a priory of San Clodio del Ribeiro.Barton, 205; Y√°√±ez Neira, 502 n1. In the foundation charter of the nunnery, which was written up at Salamanca before his father-in-law, Vela thanks Ponce for the help he received from him in acquiring the property on which the convent was to be built from Alfonso.Barton, 205. The statement of donation reads thus: > In the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, amen. I, Vela Guti√©rrez, jointly with > my wife, Sancha Ponce, give out of goodwill and voluntarily to God and to > you, Lady Aldoara P√©rez, and to your successors, for the remedy of our souls > and those of our parents and of all the late faithful, that hereditary > property that the emperor gave us in the valley of the Eria, namely, the > village they call Nogales. . .Y√°√±ez Neira, 502: En el nombre de nuestro > Se√±or Jesucristo, am√©n. Yo, Vela Guti√©rrez, juntamente con mi mujer, Sancha > Ponce, damos de buena gana y voluntariamente a Dios y a ti, do√±a Aldoara > P√©rez y a tus sucesoras, por el remedio de nuestras almas y de las de > nuestros padres y de todos los fieles difuntos, aquella heredad que nos dio > el emperador en Valder√≠a, a saber, la villa que llaman Nogales. Within ten years the new foundation had failed. According to a sixteenth- century source, Vela never completed the buildings of his monastery and after his death the nuns returned to Galicia, ceding Nogales back to Sancha.Y√°√±ez Neira, 503, citing Basilio Becerra, Chronica de la Excelent√≠sima casa de Archos Ponce de Le√≥n in the Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid, 3.292, f. 561. The sixteenth-century tumbo (cartulary) of Nogales blames the lack of resolve and discipline of the nuns. In 1164 the property of the defunct convent was given by Vela's widow to the abbey of Moreruela, which refounded it with some Cistercian monks. Besides the abbey which he had attempted to found, Vela made a pair of donations twelve years apart (1 March 1143 and 20 March 1155) to Sobrado dos Monxes with his mother, Toda P√©rez, and uncle, Rodrigo P√©rez de Traba.Barton, 262. On 23 and 29 June 1141 Vela and his cousin Gonzalo Alfonso had alienated their portions of the monastery of Lapedo to Gonzalo's brother Pedro Alfonso.Barton, 274. Vela and Sancha had six sons‚ÄîFernando, Garc√≠a, Juan, Pedro, Ponce and Rodrigo‚Äîand one daughter, Mar√≠a.There is a family tree in Barton, 307. On 5 June 1181 the three brothers Fernando, Juan and Pedro and Suero Mel√©ndez granted an estate they had inherited at Gema to their sister on the condition that after her death it would fall to the Order of Fontevrault and a convent be established there.Barton, 201. The laymen of the V√©laz family, however, retained the right to veto the election of a prioress, who was to be from among their kin. The laywomen of the V√©laz clan were given the option of residing and being cared for in the convent without having to take the habit. Notes Sources *Barton, Simon.

The game is the sequel to the 2011 game Rage. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on May 14, 2019. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its combat but criticism for its story, characters, and open world gameplay. Gameplay Rage 2 is a first-person shooter. Players assume control of a ranger named Walker, who is free to explore the game's apocalyptic open world. Players are given control over some of Walker's attributes, such as their gender, skills, or attire. Walker is able to wield various firearms and tools to fight against enemies, including returning weapons such as the wingstick. Players can develop Walker's skills with Nanotrite-based powers. Through a mode called Overdrive, Walker's guns do more damage, enemies drop more energy and they get healed constantly ‚Äî providing players with an aggressive way to mow down enemies. Nanotrites from the first game, which act as special powers and ability boosts, can be used to increase combat efficiency. The game features vehicular combat, including trucks, buggies and gyrocopters, with the player being able to drive any vehicle in the game's world. Plot Players assume control of Walker, the last Ranger of Vineland, who must survive in a world inhabited by dangerous mutants and crazed bandits after it was hit by the asteroid 99942 Apophis. The majority of humankind died during this apocalyptic event. While new settlements and factions emerged, a group called the Authority declared themselves the new military power. The game's prologue begins in Walker's home, Vineland, a city founded by former Ark residents and their descendants. Vineland gets stormed by the Authority's rebuilt Abadon mutant armies, and Walker's adoptive Aunt Prowley is killed by General Cross. Prowley leaves a pre-recorded holotape asking Walker to carry out Project Dagger, a mission conceived to stop General Cross. Walker is inducted as the last Ranger, a group of Ark survivors whose nanotrite-powered suits give them enhanced combat abilities. They are asked by Prowley's recording to find the three other members of Project Dagger; Loosum Hagar, Marshall, and Dr. Kvasir. Prowley's biological daughter, Lily, provides Walker with the Phoenix, an indestructible vehicle to travel the Wasteland, and promises to rebuild Vineland in the Ranger's absence. Marshall is found in the town of Gunbarrel. Walker is asked to assist him in restoring power to Gunbarrel before Marshall and retrieving Gulo, a scout sent by Marshall from an hostile enemy clan named the Immortal Shrouded. The scout's last defiant act was to swallow the recorder with the bunker's location, which Walker recovers from her already-carved-out gut. They proceed to the bunker, wiping out both the Immortal Shrouded and the Authority patrol sent to dislodge them, and secures the data necessary to penetrate the Authority's security scans. Loosum Hagar is the mayor of Wellspring, a major travel hub in the Wasteland. When Walker arrives at her office, the Ranger is forced to fight off an assassination attempt against the mayor, who she suspects Wasteland tycoon Klegg Clayton of masterminding the attack. Klegg tries to kill Walker after admitting he was on a first name basis with General Cross. Fighting through Klegg's henchmen, Walker warns Loosum of the plot against Wellspring and uncovers a Xerxes MK III Authority Predator tank hidden in Klegg's catacombs beneath the town. The Ranger follows Klegg to an Authority bunker, to witness General Cross put down his unsuccessful lackey for failing to deliver Wellspring. Exploring deeper into the facility, Walker finds evidence that the Authority is building massive Abadon mutants piece by piece, calling them \\"Titans\\" and planning to unleash them on the rest of the Wasteland. Walker tears the fusion core out of a huge, half-build Titan, causing a chain reaction that destroys the facility and simultaneously securing a power source for the Xerxes III Predator tank that is necessary to complete Project Dagger. Dr. Anton Kvasir is a master of genetic manipulation tasked to create a nanotrite virus that would disable General Cross' ability to clone himself indefinitely to prolong his life. The scientist invites Walker into his sanctum, where he says he is held back from finishing his project by insufficient computing power. Walker is asked to land Eco-Pod 15, the last of a series of satellites tasked with re-seeding the Earth with life in the event that the Apophis meteor rendered the planet barren after impact. After entering EDEN Space Center, Kvasir hacks the Vault mainframe to grant Walker the status of POTUS to ensure they can access every aspect of the EDEN Project. Successful in lowering Eco-Pod 15 back to Earth, Walker slaves its processor to Kvasir's mainframe before being forced to fight off an Authority strike force. Kvasir sends Walker on a mission to retrieve a DNA sample from General Cross. Raiding an Authority base for the sample, Walker frees captives from Vineland whose DNA was used in horrific cloning and mutant experiments. Walker decapitates General Cross after defeating him in battle, though a fresh clone of the General escapes. Back at Kvasir's lab, the doctor uses Cross' severed head to produce the nanotrite virus that was his part of Project Dagger. With the three components, Walker initiates the final phase of Project Dagger by infiltrating the Authority HQ. Able to gain entry to the compound by impersonating General Cross, the Ranger is discovered by the real general. General Cross meets Walker while riding a gigantic Cyber Titan, and the two battle. Killing the Titan, Walker stabs Cross in the eye with the Nanotrite Virus, causing his DNA to be corrupted to prevent future clones from being created. However, unbeknownst to Walker due to Kvasir's manipulation, the Ranger's own nanotrites are also susceptible to the virus. Choking to death alongside the broken body of General Cross, Walker is saved by the intervention of Lily, who returns them to Hagar's Wellspring office for medical treatment. With Lily's gun to his head, Dr. Kvasir works frantically to save the Ranger. When he succeeds, the doctor begs for his life from the enraged Lily, who spares him. The game ends with Walker regaining consciousness and thanking Lily for her help, promising to continue helping the Wasteland as the Last Ranger. Development Rage 2 is a joint development between id Software and Avalanche Studios. Avalanche was selected as the collaboration partner for the project as id Software was impressed by Avalanche's work on Just Cause 3, especially its physics-based emergent gameplay. According to Tim Willits, the team hoped that the sequel could deliver on the promise made by the first game, which was limited by technology during its time of release. Willits added that Rage 2 was designed to be the player's \\"power fantasy\\", thus they ensured that they will not feel underpowered at the beginning of the game. The game features a colorful color palette so as to distinguish itself from other id Software games. Rage 2 utilizes Avalanche Studios' proprietary Apex game engine instead of id Tech, which had been used for the predecessor. The Apex engine allowed the team to create detailed indoor environments as well as broad outdoor locations, also allowing players to transition between these worlds without any loading screens. The game engine uses the Vulkan API exclusively. A sequel to Rage was hinted by Bethesda's Pete Hines, who believed that both Rage and The Evil Within had sold enough to warrant sequels. In mid-May 2018, rumors of the sequel were fueled when Walmart Canada's website updated its video game sections with several as-yet-unannounced titles, which included Rage 2. Bethesda poked fun at Walmart over social media in the following days, but this turned into more direct hints of the sequel's existence. Bethesda formally revealed Rage 2 on May 14, 2018 with a teaser trailer and a gameplay trailer the next day. The game was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on May 14, 2019. The game's Collector Edition, which includes a severed mutant head voiced by Andrew W.K., is set to be released alongside the standard edition. Players who preordered the game will have access to an exclusive mission and additional gameplay items. Willits revealed that the game will be a game as a service, and he promised that lootboxes would not be present in the game. Rage 2 was released on Steam with Denuvo digital rights management. However, the game was cracked within a day because the version on Bethesda's own store did not use Denuvo. Denuvo was subsequently removed from the Steam release. An expansion pack titled Rise of the Ghosts was released on September 26, 2019. It introduced cheats, new vehicles, a new story, and pilotable mechs to the game. Reception On release, Rage 2 received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to the review aggregator Metacritic. Daniel Tack from Game Informer rated the game a 7/10, praising the game's shooting mechanics and music but criticized the visuals, open-world and characters. Dan Stapleton from IGN gave a rating of 8/10, comparing the game to 2016's Doom, praising the game for its gunplay and the open-world gameplay as well as the abilities and the visual style, but felt bemused about the use of microtransactions as it featured no co-op or multiplayer. Michael Higham from GameSpot gave the game a 6/10, praising the game's combat and abilities, but criticized the humor, short length, narrative, characters, gameplay and side activities. =Sales= Rage 2 was the best-selling retail game in the United Kingdom in its week of release, beating Days Gone, although its physical sales figures were only 25% of the original game's launch-week sales. In Japan, the PlayStation 4 version Rage 2 was also the best-selling retail game during its first week of release, selling 12,146 copies.

The University of Leeds held a referendum on the sales of bottled water in 2008, becoming the first university in the United Kingdom to ban bottled still water from all their bars, cafes and shops. The small town of Bundanoon, New South Wales (Australia) enacted such a ban in 2009 and was the first town to do so anywhere. In 2009, Washington University in St. Louis became the first university in the United States to ban the sale of plastic, single-use water bottles. In 2013 The University of Vermont (UVM) in Burlington became the first public college in the U.S. to enact such a ban. As of late 2016, 82 high schools, colleges and universities across the world have implemented bottled water bans on their campuses. Municipalities have also banned bottled water from their facilities, such as the city of San Francisco, California.  Motivation  The use of plastics continues to rise in our daily lives due to its convenience and cheap price. But the cost that is not obvious to many is the environmental and health impacts they are leaving behind. Plastics are made from fossil fuels. The use of these leaves a large ecological footprint on the environment, not to mention that these plastics do not break down easily, if at all. According to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, a discarded plastic bottle takes 450 years to decompose. The overuse of plastics results in a dumping of plastics into the oceans at a rate of 8 million tons per year. The piling up of plastics around the world continues to build up and now we are facing issues like the Great Pacific garbage patch. Scientists now have estimated that at the rate will continue to dump plastics into our oceans, by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans. Additional to environmental impacts, plastics have been claimed to leave behind chemicals detrimental to human health such as the neurotoxin Bisphenol A (also known as BPA). Other chemicals in plastics have even been linked to cancer. These claims, however, are generally urban legends or vast exaggeration. For these reasons some governments are interested in banning the use of single-use plastic water bottles in their regions to lower these impacts on the environment and promote sustainability within their boundaries.  Sub-national bans by country  = Australia = In 2009, the New South Wales town of Bundanoon voted to become the first town in the world to outlaw bottled water. Its citizens voluntarily chose to ban bottled water in response to a bottling company's desire to sell water from the town's local aquifer, prohibiting the selling or dispensing of bottled water within the town precinct.http://www.bundyontap.com.au Bundanoon's twelve stores and cafe's as well as events in the town, have removed bottled water from their stock. The town now offers public drinking fountains and filtered water dispensers where people can fill up reusable water bottles and canteens. The reusable empty bottles are sold in place of full bottles in the local stores. The town's ban received media attention from major news outlets. The decision to ban bottled water was partly due to opposition to a proposed water extraction plant, and partly to concern related to the environmental and health impacts. =Canada= Many Canadian municipalities have passed bans on municipal properties including: Ajax; Burlington, Cornwall, London, Newmarket, Niagara Falls, Oakville, Oshawa, Peterborough, St. Catharines, Windsor, Waterloo, Nelson, Victoria, Vancouver. These were followed in December 2008, by Toronto, Canada's most populous city. The Toronto City Council approved a water bottle ban to take effect in January 2012. The ban, which affects most of Toronto's parks and park facilities, prohibits the sale and distribution of water bottles in all Civic Centres, City facilities. and parks. =United States= In 2011, New Haven passed a municipal spending ban including bulk bottled water dispensers. In June 2007, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom released an executive directive to phase out the usage of water bottles in the city. The directive for San Francisco had strict consequences. If a public event that has more than 100 people is caught distributing water bottles, the event sponsors can pay a fine of up to $500. Many city offices who supported the ban complied quickly with the phase out of water bottles except for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who spent about $4,387 on water bottles for three years after the ban was put into effect. San Francisco is one of the largest cities in the country to initiate such a ban yet the city did not offer the people a public policy to allow for access to free water. On March 11, 2014, The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed Ordinance 28-14 which amends its Enivroment Code to execute a ban on the sale of plastic water bottles that contain less than 21 ounces through the City of San Francisco.http://sfenvironment.org/sites/default/files/policy/sfe_zw_bottled_water_ordinance.pdf With only a 23% recycle rate of the 50 billion plastic bottles used in the U.S., it is no surprise that this ban of plastic bottles was widely accepted by city officials of San Francisco and its citizens. To maintain easy access to water for its citizens, the City of San Francisco plans on implementing a Drink Tap Program which will install outdoor water bottle refilling stations to ensure the public stays hydrated. Many of these stations will be dispersed throughout the city. At the Town Meeting of May, 2015, Brookline, Massachusetts passed a by-law prohibiting the spending of Town funds on water in single-use plastic bottles in offices. It will be considering further restrictions based on San Francisco's ordinance. The Town also instituted a requirement that restaurants serve tap water on request including take-out orders.  Concord, Massachusetts  Legislation banning the sale of single-serving plastic water bottles passed in Concord, Massachusetts on April 26, 2012, making Concord the first village in the nation to ban single-serving plastic bottles. The passage was largely due to the efforts of 84-year-old Jean Hill. The ban took effect on January 1, 2013. Two previous attempts to ban bottled water in the town had failed. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, which have the number 1 and/or PETE with the recycling symbol on the bottle are no longer allowed to be sold if they are less than or equal to 1 liter (34 ounces) and contain water which is non-sparkling and non-flavored. The sale of water in bottles made of other types of plastic is allowed. Bottles of flavored water, regardless of size, may be sold. The sale of cases of small (<1 liter) bottles of water is prohibited. Bottled water less than or equal to 1 liter in volume may not be sold in vending machines. Bottled water less than or equal to 1 liter in volume may not be sold at civic events including but not limited to sports events, road races, festivals, theater performances and catered events. Water may be offered for free to patrons in any form. In January 2013 the Health Division of the Town Manager‚Äôs Office of the Town of Concord began inspections of retail stores, restaurants, and other venues that sell bottled beverages. The Health Division is tasked with ensuring compliance with the bylaw against bottled water sales under 1 liter. If bottled water less than 1 liter is being sold, a written warning is issued. Within one week a re-inspection will occur; if this is failed, a $25 fine is issued as a non-criminal citation. On the third and subsequent inspections, a non-criminal citation with a fine of $50 is issued if bottled water continues to be sold in violation of the bylaw. There is controversy over this act. The International Bottled Water Association issued a press release stating that: ‚ÄúThis ban deprives residents of the option to choose their choice of beverage and visitors, who come to this birthplace of American independence, a basic freedom gifted to them by the actions in this town more than 200 years ago. It will also deprive the town of needed tax revenue and harm local businesses that rely on bottled water sales.‚Äù The IBWA reinforced this statement in response to the proposed ban on bottled water in the city of San Francisco. It added that restricting access to bottled water will lead consumers to opt for unhealthier bottled options that may involve, ‚Äúmore packaging, more additives (e.g., sugar, caffeine), and greater environmental impacts than bottled water.‚Äù Some businesses opposed the ban, saying it restricts freedom of choice and will simply drive bottled water sales out of town. Other towns near Concord have explored similar bans. Some residents of the Town of Arlington brought one to its Spring Town Meeting of 2013, but it was defeated in a voice vote. A high-school student proposed a ban by-law at the Fall 2014 Town Meeting in Framingham, where it was defeated by a vote of 60 to 40. Among those opposing the ban in both communities was the supermarket chain Stop & Shop. Framingham also has a Poland Spring bottling plant, and its owner Nestl√© Waters North America opposed the ban as well. Two towns that border Concord have passed bottled water bans similar to Concord's by-law: Sudbury on May 2, 2017; and Lincoln in March, 2018. Great Barrington in Berkshire county passed one in May, 2018. Some citizens attempted to revoke the law the following August, but failed.  Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts  On April 9, 2019, the Town Meeting of West Tisbury, Massachusetts, banned the sale of non- alcoholic carbonated beverages in single-serve plastic bottles (defined as less than 34 ounces) starting January 1, 2020. This is apparently the first such law in the United State to cover soft drinks and similar beverages. Two neighboring towns on the island, Chilmark and Aquinnah, will vote on similar measures within the following month.  Cape Cod, Massachusetts  In January 2019, a regional campaign, the Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban, to eliminate municipal purchase of single-use plastic bottles and the sale of beverages in single-use plastic containers on town property, was initiated by Sustainable Practices, a Cape Cod-based nonprofit focused on grassroots environmental action and stewardship. The organization was established in Massachusetts by Madhavi Venkatesan. Citizen's Petitions were filed for town adoption of the Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban by-law in the towns of: Brewster, Chatham, Dennis, Harwich, Orleans, Sandwich and Yarmouth and two petitions were submitted through the town Recycling Committees of Provincetown and Wellfleet. The Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban by-law was adopted in Chatham, Harwich, Orleans, and Wellfleet on their respective town meeting floors and passed unanimously with the exception of Harwich, which passed by a margin of 57 votes. Provincetown's Selectboard adopted the Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban as policy. Of the remaining towns: Brewster, Sandwich and Yarmouth postponed the vote, while Dennis failed to pass by 24 votes. Sustainable Practices refiled Citizen's Petitions in the towns of Brewster, Yarmouth and Sandwich in the fall of 2019 and filed a Citizen's Petition in Falmouth. In Dennis, the organization worked through the town Recycling Committees and in Eastham directly with the town, to have the Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban adopted as a policy, pending a bylaw vote at spring 2020 Town Meeting. As of November 18, 2019 the Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban was adopted in the form (bylaw or policy) submitted in all towns that were petitioned: Brewster, Dennis, Eastham, Falmouth, Sandwich, and Yarmouth for a overall adoption of 11 of the 15 towns that comprise Cape Cod, also identified as Barnstable County. The goal of the Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban is to have a uniform municipal policy on single-use plastic bottles across Barnstable County and facilitate education on citizen-based responsibility in protecting municipal water. The organization also includes an economic literacy dimension by providing education on the true cost (lifecycle expense) of resource-intensive, convenience-oriented, plastic beverage containers. The Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban references the first stage of the Sustainable Practices' strategy. The second phase is the Commercial Single-use Plastic Water Bottle Ban, which was initiated in January 2020. As of February 2020, all 11 towns having adopted the Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban will be voting on the Commercial Single-use Plastic Water Bottle Ban at their respective Town Meetings. The remaining four towns: Bourne, Mashpee, Truro and Barnstable have been petitioned to implement the Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban. Given social distancing and congregation limits recommended by the state of Massachusetts related to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Town Meetings scheduled for April and May were postponed. =India= In 2015, the state of Bihar has banned the usage of plastic water bottles in governmental meetings. In 2016, the state of Sikkim restricted the usage of plastic water bottles (in government functions and meetings) along with styrofoam products. The government of Maharashtra banned all single-use plastic beverage bottles in March 2018. Single-use is defined there as under half a liter. Larger sizes have a refundable fee applied to them. The government of Gujarat banned use of plastic mineral water bottle in all government offices and events from March 2019.  University bans  Despite being the first American public university to enact a ban on bottled water in 2013, the University of Vermont has not yet experienced much positive effect from the implemented ban. University professor Rachel Johnson has seen, ‚Äútotal number of bottles on campus increase.‚Äù In conjunction with the ban, UVM integrated a number of filtered water stations across campus. However, the consumption of other bottled beverages such as soda and juices has become more prevalent. The university continues its efforts by, ‚Äúdoubling the number of water stations on campus and stocking them with biodegradable cups.‚Äù Contrary to the University of Vermont, overall bottled beverage sales have decreased by more than a third over the past seven years at Washington University in St. Louis. Since eliminating the sales of bottled water on campus, the university has also seen a decrease in soda fountain sales, which leads observers to believe that water is not necessarily being replaced by sugary beverage alternatives. The assistant vice chancellor for sustainability largely attributes the university‚Äôs success to its bottled water ban, as well as its accompanying efforts to retrofit old water fountains, add new water stations on campus, and celebrate the student body‚Äôs growing interest in sustainability.  Alternatives to plastic bottles  Some alternatives to plastic bottles are already available and many more are to be designed. For example, a simple solution to this is to use a reusable bottle and fill it up at stations, water fountains, or food establishments. Another alternative to single use plastic bottled water is aluminum canned and bottled water. Aluminum cans are unique in that they are most often recycled directly back into themselves meaning that the average can has a very high percentage of recycled content. This means that aluminum cans have more than three times the recycled content than EPA estimates for glass or plastic, with 70 percent recycled content on average. Innovative alternatives to plastics continue to emerge. A group of students has managed to created a biodegradable plastic bottle from algae and other natural materials. The implementation and use of a product like this could take a big cut in the use of plastics.

VJ has been portrayed by various child actors since his introduction. Felix Dean played the role from 2007 until it was recast in 2014, and Matthew Little took over. VJ made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 30 November 2001. He departed on 23 November 2017. He made a final appearance over video footage on 5 February 2018. Casting The character made his first appearance on 30 November 2001 when he was born to established characters Leah (Ada Nicodemou) and Vinnie Patterson (Ryan Kwanten). From his introduction, VJ has been played by eleven different child actors: Carlo Teodorowych, Jack Monger, Max Theoharis, Marcus Spinetti, Jack Riddle, Harry Roberts, James Roberts, Nicholas Stevens, Cameron Stevens and Cooper Scott. Felix Dean was cast in the role in 2007. Nicodemou viewed Dean as a \\"surrogate son\\" and felt the same way that Leah does for VJ. She has also stated that she became attached to each actor that has played VJ. In May 2014, Nicodemou confirmed that the character had been recast once again. Dean finished filming earlier in the year, while VJ went off-screen for a while. Of the new actor, Nicodemou explained \\"We've got a new bloke, Matt, who's started in the role. He is really lovely and eager. I think he's going to be really, really popular as well.\\" The actress added that VJ would be all grown up when he returns, as the producers wanted him to look older. On 31 August 2014, it was confirmed that Matthew Little had taken over the role. Little was cast shortly after he completed a brief stint in rival soap opera Neighbours. He said, \\"I was facing unemployment and literally got the call, so it was a relief to be offered another job to be honest.\\" Development =Father figures= Early storylines for VJ were developed through his mother, Leah's relationships. His father, Vinnie is sent to prison and meets his old friend Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin). Vinnie convinces Jesse to go to Summer Bay on his release and look out for VJ and Leah. Nicodemou told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that Leah thinks Jesse is a reformed character because Vinnie would not have sent him to stay otherwise. Leah grows close to Jesse following the death of Vinnie in a fire. VJ begins to choke and Jesse saves his life and subsequently Leah kisses him. The actress told Herbison that Jesse forms a bond with VJ which makes him an ideal partner. Jesse helps Leah through problems with VJ's hearing. Following a break-up, Leah learns that VJ will become permanently deaf unless he has another operation. Jesse acts as Leah's \\"rock\\" throughout VJ's health issues and Leah wants to reconcile their relationship. Leah begins a relationship with Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart) They keep it a secret knowing that VJ is still close to her ex-boyfriend Elijah Johnson (Jay Laga'aia). Nicodemou told a writer from Inside Soap that VJ and Miles get along \\"really well\\" and he plays a \\"great father figure\\" to VJ. Leah does not want to ruin their friendship. VJ discovers the truth but chooses not to tell Leah. When Leah does admit to being with Miles, VJ reveals that already knew and has \\"major reservations\\" about their relationship. The actress said that Leah has been a struggling single mother since VJ was born. \\"As a result, the poor boy's had to grow up so quickly. He's very protective of his mum, so any man coming into their lives is going to have to prove himself worthy - even Miles.\\" Leah later discovers that she is pregnant. But VJ is unhappy with the development and voices his concern. Nicodemou told the writer that Leah and Miles are worried because VJ is unenthusiastic about her pregnancy. She explained that VJ has \\"seen his mum go through a lot over the years, and isn't sure that they're ready for this just yet.\\" VJ is \\"devastated\\" when Leah and Miles break up and he blames his mother. When Miles notices that VJ is struggling to cope with the changes, he tries talking with him, but VJ ends up hating his mother even more. VJ tries telling Leah how he feels, but when she refuses to listen, VJ packs a bag and runs away from home. A show spokesperson told Susan Hill from the Daily Star, \\"Leah has been through a lot these past few weeks and has not realised just how badly VJ has reacted to her split from Miles. When she notices he's gone she is beside herself with worry. She realises how selfish she's been and is desperate to find the lad before anything happens.\\" =Kidnap= In early 2009, VJ was kidnapped by Brian Lawler (Ric Herbert), who was desperate to get his hands on Leah's inheritance. VJ was playing with Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best) when he went missing. When Leah started looking for him, she was not initially worried, until she got a phone call from someone asking for a ransom of $25,000. Leah was not aware that the kidnapper was Brian, until she went to hand over the money. Nicodemou revealed that VJ was in \\"a lot of danger\\" and Leah did not know if he was okay. When she met with Brian, she saw VJ in the car, but Brian had a police radio and when he heard there was a call-out, he drove off with VJ. Leah was hysterical and thought that since Brian had the money, why would he come back with her son? Brian was eventually apprehended by the police and VJ was reunited with his mother. =Departure= On 23 November 2017, Little's final scenes as VJ were broadcast. VJ flees the Bay with Luc Patterson, so that her biological father Mick Jennings (Kristian Schmid) cannot gain custody of her. Little admitted that he was not surprised to learn that VJ was being written out, saying \\"I knew it had to end at a certain point. The way he left, I was comfortable in that it made sense.\\" Following Little's departure, his co-stars paid tribute to him on social media, with Nicodemou commenting \\"I miss you so much and work just isn't the same without my little big boy there. I'm so proud of your work and your journey and I can't wait to see what the next adventure looks like.\\" Storylines On the day VJ is born, his father Vinnie is arrested for fraud and later stands trial. Vinnie is found guilty and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. VJ's mother Leah struggles to raise him despite assistance from VJ's uncle Alex Poulos (Danny Raco).

On VJ's third birthday, Vinnie, revealed to be alive in witness protection, visits in the guise of a teddy bear and leaves a letter telling Leah and VJ to move with their lives. VJ is left injured when Dan's son Ryan (Issac Gorman) sets fire to Dan and Leah's wedding invitations but makes a recovery. In spite of Ryan's behaviour, Leah and Dan marry and VJ gains a new father figure and stepbrother.

Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) returns and tells Leah that her daughter, Pippa Saunders, who Leah carried as a surrogate, has mitochondrial disease. Leah gets VJ tested and he is given the all-clear. Pippa didn't know about it until VJ and Jett told her about her disease and VJ and Jett felt stupid to tell her.

Reception For his portrayal of VJ, Dean was nominated for Best Young Actor at the 2008 and 2009 Inside Soap Awards. VJ's name has been a source of amusement to some critics, with one calling him \\"unfortunately named\\" and another believing that he was named after an \\"early model Holden\\". Linda Barnier and Ben Doherty from the Newcastle Herald wrote that they understood his name to be short for \\"Video Disc Jockey\\", while the Sun Herald' Brian Courtis thought he had been \\"sensitively named\\". A reporter for the Sunday Mail dubbed the character a \\"hideous brat\\". Gary Gillatt from Inside Soap bemoaned VJ's 2014 recast, saying \\"Are we really supposed to believe these Summer Bay 'kids' are the same age? VJ now looks about 10 years older than Jett!\\" References External links *VJ Patterson at the Official AU Home and Away website * VJ Patterson on IMDb Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2001 Category:Fictional Greek people in television Category:Child characters in television Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Male characters in television ","title":"VJ Patterson"},{"id":"39806060","text":"Jimmi Madsen (born January 4, 1969) is a Danish former cyclist who raced professionally from 1993 to 2004.

Species in this family infect insects (Diptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera). History This family was created by L√©ger and Duboscq in 1908. Taxonomy Three genera are currently recognised in this family. The type genus is Schizocystis. Lifecycle The parasites develop in extracellular locations. The trophozoites are large, band like and wide. They have longitudinal striae and are aseptate. A mucron of small pseudopods or sucker is present. The nuclei are large. Merogony occurs once in the lifecycle. Nuclear division proceeds with binary fission during growth. Cytokinesis occurs to form uninucleate merozoites arranged in clusters in the shape of the trophozoite. The merozoites become free by dropping off the parent trophozoite. Gamonts, gametocysts and oocysts are of the actinocephalid type with syzygy occurring just before gametocyst formation. The young gamonts are vermiform (wormlike). The gametocysts are mostly spherical. The oocysts are spindle-shaped with eight sporozoites.

Biography =In Ia»ôi= Liviu Deleanu was born in Ia»ôi, the capital of the Romanian province of Moldavia, in a house on strada Veche (Veche street) in 1911. His father, Semi (Shmil) Kligman, was a poet in Yiddish and Hebrew, who supported his earliest poetic efforts. Deleanu hated his childhood, recalling the privations faced by him and his mother after his father was conscripted during the First World War. His mother, who was not well educated, instilled in him a love of language and folk imagination. However, it was his aunt, famous in the family for her verses, from whom he inherited his poetic gift. Deleanu studied at a cheder and at a Romanian gymnasium. At age 11, he began an apprenticeship as a lithographer and a proofreader, and quickly entered the literary life. He joined the magazine Vitrina Literar«é (Literary showcase) as a staff-member at the age of 16, where he wrote under the pseudonyms Cliglon and C.L. Deleanu. The same year, under the name Liviu Deleanu, he published his first collection of poetry Oglinzi fermecate (Magic mirrors). In 1928, along with the poet Virgil Gheorghiu (1903-1977), Deleanu founded his own journal Prospect (subtitled Simptom literar), which was recognised by George CƒÉlinescu in his authoritative Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne (History of Romanian Literature) as one of the first modernist periodicals published in Romania. In the first three issues, edited by Deleanu himself, appeared poems by him and Virgil Gheorghiu; from the fourth issue onwards, other names appeared as well: Mihail Bicleanu, Sa»ôa PanƒÉ, Aurel Zaremba and others. =In Bucharest= In 1928, Deleanu continued his literary career in Bucharest. During his sojourn in the Romanian capital, he wrote theatre reviews, reportage, articles on art, advertising, printed translation from the Yiddish, and published fragments of his novel in such journals as Adam (the organ of the Jewish community of the city), Edi≈£ie special«é (Special edition), Bilete de papagal (a satirical magazine edited by Tudor Arghezi) and Cuv√Æntul liber (The Free Word). His second collection of poetry Ceasul de veghe (The Hour of the Vigil) was released by Santier publishing house in 1937 to favourable reviews from Bucharest's critics such as George CƒÉlinescu ('Mr. Deleanu's collection of poems reveals humanitarian concerns, sympathy for the miners, workers, designers, vagrants. The subject should not frighten, because Mr. Deleanu has treated it with remarkable skill...'), Izabella Sadoveanu, and Enrica Furtuna. Deleanu's third collection Glod alb (White mud) was published by Cultura Poporului (Popular Culture) in 1940. In it was included a long poetic cycle on the Spanish Civil War that was originally written in 1937, Sabii peste Spania (Swords over Spain), along with well-known poems such as Serenade pe baricade (Serenade on the barricades), Don Quijote, Guernica, A doua moarte (Second death). In the prewar years, some of Deleanu's poems became popular songs, including Sanie cu zurgƒÉlƒÉi (Sleigh bells - set to music by Richard Stein, 1909-1992), which was for a long time considered the national song. =In Moldavia= After the absorption of Bessarabia into the USSR, Deleanu moved to Chi»ôinƒÉu and immediately joined the literary life of the city. Along with Bogdan Istru, he translated the National Anthem of the Soviet Union into Moldovan. During the Second World War, he lived in Moscow, translating Russian poetry into Moldovan. Some of the poets he translated were Ivan Krylov, Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Nikolay Nekrasov, Sergei Yesenin, Sergey Mikhalkov, Korney Chukovsky, Aleksandr Tvardovsky as well as Agniya Barto. He wrote Balada lui Kotovschii (The Ballad of Kotovsky), Ballada urii and several other works. From 1943, he also worked as literary editor of the ensemble Doina. Returning to Chi»ôinƒÉu in 1944, Deleanu received news of the death of his parents during the Ia»ôi pogrom of 1941, in which during a week, more than 14,000 Jews of the town were murdered. Deleanu wrote the anguished poem Co≈ümar (Nightmare). The same year, he met his soon-to-be wife, Baka Rivilis (1921-2005), at Soroca, where she was working at the provincial archives. For the rest of his life, she remained a faithful and energetic promoter of Deleanu's oeuvre while maintaining a busy schedule of her own translation work. In the post-war years, he wrote Elegy to victory and his great poem Krasnodon (1950; but a reworked version of this appeared in book form titled Tinere≈£e f«ér«é moarte (Immortal youth) came out in 1957, with eleven subsequent editions), which was influenced by A. A. Fadeyev's Young Guard. In 1951, he wrote the dramatic poem Buzduganul fermeca (The magic mace), based on a Moldovan folk-tale; it remains very popular in the Moldovan theatre to this day. His wartime poems were published in the 1952 collection Vremuri noi (New times). In subsequent years, he published numerous other collections of poetry: Mi-i drag sƒÉ me≈üteresc (I love tinkering, 1953), Poezii ≈üi poeme (Poems, 1954), C«énturi de ieri ≈üi de azi (Songs of the past and the present, 1958), Stihuri alese (Collected poetry, 1958), FreamƒÉt (1962), Ie≈üire din legend«é (Exit into legend, 1963), Dragostea noastr«é cea de toat«é zilele (Our everyday love, 1966), Versuri (Verses, 1967). He also wrote books for children: Poezii pentru copii (Verses for children, 1947), Nepo≈£ica o √Ænva≈£ƒÉ pe bunica (The Granddaughter teaches her grandmother, 1952), Licurici: stihuri pentru mici (Firefly: poems for little ones, 1961), Triluri vesele (Merry trills, 1963 and 1979). After his premature death, Deleanu's oeuvre went into several editions, including the collections Scrieri (Writings in two volumes), De la mic la mare (For little ones and big ones, 1968), Cartea dorului (Book of wishes, 1968), DestƒÉinuire (1970), StrigƒÉt din inimƒÉ (Cry from the heart, 1976), Cu c√¢ntƒÉri ≈üi flori pe plai (With songs and flowers of the realm, 1980), ≈ûi de n-ar fi cuv√¢ntul iubire (Were there no word for love, 1981), Chem c√¢ntecul (Call songs, 1982), Ala-bala portocala (1984), Cioc√¢rlii pentru copii (Larks for kids, 1987), Poezii (Poems, 1991), Z«ép«écil«é (2002). Selected poems began to appear in collections in Romania: RƒÉscolite tƒÉceri (2001) and Prutele, t«écutele! (2003) in Timi»ôoara, and Vremi √Æn alte vremi topite (2005) in Ia»ôi. The publisher Causa Mundi (Chi»ôinƒÉu) released Deleanu's translations of Pushkin's The Fisherman and the Golden Fish (Povestea pescarului si a pestisorului de aur, 2005). Many of his children's poems gained prominence in Russian translation. Some of Deleanu's works were set to music: Poem on Haia Lif≈üi≈£ by the composer Solomon Lobel (1910-1981) for mixed choir, a cappella and solo (1965). During the last months of his life, Deleanu finished The Book of Wishes, having written a poem a day. He died in hospital on 12 May 1967. During his literary career in Moldova, Deleanu never received any literary prizes. Posthumously, however, he was awarded the Boris Glavan Komsomol Prize in 1967 for his poem Tinere≈£e f«ér«é moarte (Immortal youth). These days, his poems are included in the curricula of Moldovan schools. In Romania, Deleanu's works remain practically unknown, and only recently have they started appearing in disparate books and magazines, despite the fact that his Romanian sojourn had been one of the most fruitful of his life. The reasons for this obscurity can be found in the realities of pre-war Romania and the political circumstances that forced him to emigrate to Soviet Moldavia. For the same reasons, Deleanu's artistic oeuvre accomplished while in Romania remained practically unknown in Soviet Moldavia as well. Style Deleanu's poetry evolved from the modernism of his early days to a more traditional style of classical poetry in his later years. Its motives, concepts and expressive works of the period between the first and second world wars, are modern, fitting perfectly in the direction of Romanian poetry of those years. He used modernist techniques and stylistic devices of poetry including free verse. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, Deleanu's literary profile took a new and different form. In his poetry collections, which included literary works of absolute maturity, he cleaved to the traditional in his classic expression. The world of his creations of the postwar period is based on a certain themes: love, nature, the process of creation, the fate of the creator, and age over time - the motives which in the context of the Bessarabian poetry of the postwar period, clearly depict the image of a lyric poet of genuine sensitivity. His poetry indicates a special interest in formal and expressive perfection.

He was a part-time student in the ceramics department of Derby College of Art from 1946 to 1956, becoming later a part-time lecturer there and at Ilkeston College of Further Education. At the pottery Colledge was given the studio formerly used by the Austrian designer Alice Teichtner. Here he created \\"Glyn Ware\\", characterised by designs of trailing leaves. To avoid the high rate of purchase tax on decorative pottery the ware was given functional descriptions, and each piece was signed by Colledge so that it would be classed as studio pottery. Colledge took early retirement from Denby in 1983.

In 2013, he joined Machine Head as bassist, replacing Adam Duce. Biography MacEachern started singing in his parents' church choir when he was five and did that until he was thirteen. He started playing musical instruments when he was ten, starting with the violin but then switching to cello, and then to bass guitar, which he played for several years. He graduated from Frank W. Cox High School in Virginia Beach. He went to college for music performance for bass. He then met his future Sanctity bandmates and switched to guitar. MacEachern became exposed to heavy metal music around the age of twelve. A friend had a copy of Metallica's Black album and he played the song \\"The Unforgiven.\\" Afterwards, another friend gave MacEachern an old copy of Kill 'Em All. MacEachern was captivated, as he did not previously know music in that style existed. He considers his two favorite heavy metal albums to be Kill 'Em All and Arise by Sepultura. He became completely enamored with all the metal bands of that time, such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Pantera, but for his bass playing, his main influence was former Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. =Sanctity= With a brief stint at the Brevard School for Music Performance, MacEachern has consistently played bass for over two decades. However, in Sanctity he played Rhythm Guitar. They formed in 1998 and have released one album, Road to Bloodshed, on April 24, 2007. In February 2008, MacEachern left Sanctity for personal reasons. His child had recently been born and MacEachern wanted to focus on being a good father. In October 2010, Serenity Dies, a thrash metal band from the Maldives formed in 2005, announced that it had begun writing new material with MacEachern, who stated: ‚Äî \\"I'm really excited to join Serenity Dies. This band is exactly what I was looking for and I'm stoked that they asked me to be a part of it! We've already got our collective creative juices flowing, and new songs are in the works. We're all really looking forward to breaking some heads!\\" =Machine Head= In June 2013, Machine Head announced that Jared MacEachern had joined as an official member, replacing their former bassist and founding member, Adam Duce.

In 1965 the firm was granted a 40-year lease to operate an open pit mine on 385 square kilometers by the Guatemalan government. The mine is located in El Estor in Izabal Department. The mine has reserves amounting to 36.1 million tonnes of ore grading 1.86% nickel. The Fenix ferro-nickel project in Guatemala is owned by Compa√±√≠a Guatemalteca de Niquel (CGN), formerly EXMIBAL, a subsidiary of Inco, which was 98.2% owned by Hudbay Minerals from August 2008 to September 2011 when it was sold for $170 million to the Russian owned Solway Group, headquartered in Cyprus. The operation had been on care and maintenance since 1980. Skye Resources, a Vancouver firm, had purchased the project from Inco in 2004 but was acquired by Hudbay in 2008. The Fenix Project in eastern Guatemala is a substantial brownfield nickel laterite mine and process plant. HudBay Minerals and two of its subsidiaries are subject to an ongoing $12 million lawsuit in Canada over the killing of a prominent Mayan community leader at the Fenix Mining Project. The lawsuit alleges that on September 27, 2009, security personnel employed at the Fenix mine surrounded, beat and hacked at Adolfo Ich Cham√°n with machetes before shooting him in the head at close range in an unprovoked attack.http://www.chocversushudbay.com/wp- content/uploads/2010/11/Fresh-As-Amended-Statement-of-Claim-filed.pdf An arrest warrant was issued for the Head of Security at the Fenix mine, Mynor Ronaldo Padilla Gonz√°les.Mining Weekly Guatemalan widow's lawsuit against HudBay could be precedent setting A non-governmental organization has referred to the murder as the ‚Äútargeted killing of a well-known community leader.‚Äù Amnesty International has stated with respect to the murder allegation ‚Äú[t]he allegations are very serious, and Amnesty International calls for a swift, full and impartial investigation into the death of Adolfo Ich Cham√°n and other incidents of violence, to make the results public and to bring those responsible to justice‚Äù. HudBay states that it and CGN have cooperated fully with all investigations conducted by Guatemalan authorities in connection with the incidents which occurred on September 27, 2009, in El Estor. CGN carried out an internal investigation and determined that none of its employees or security personnel were involved in the death of Cham√°n.HudBay Minerals Web Site Statement of Events, of September 27, 2009, El Estor, Guatemala HudBay Minerals web site Correcting W5 Report In June 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the Canadian company could be held legally responsible for crimes committed in Guatemala, including the alleged murder of Adolfo Ich Cham√°n and the alleged sexual assault of 11 women from Lote Ocho. A jury notice was filed in December 2013. The Fenix mining project is also subject to ongoing land claims by local Mayan communities. In 2006, the International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations, ruled that Guatemala had breached international law by granting the Fenix mining concession without first consulting with local Mayan people. The ILO released a report discussing the violation in 2007. In late 2006 and early 2007, Skye Resources (acquired by HudBay Minerals in 2008, renamed HMI Nickel and subsequently sold by HudBay in 2011) sought forced evictions of Mayan communities located on contested mine land.

She sometimes used the pseudonym Lotta Triven. She published poems, stories, and work about political and scientific subjects. She was the first female to be published by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Biography Charlotta Fr√∂lich was the daughter of the Royal Councillor General Count Carl Gustaf Fr√∂lich and Beata Christina Cronstr√∂m, and the paternal niece of the religious visionary and author Eva Margareta Fr√∂lich. In 1735, she married count Johan Funck, country governor of Uppland. Fr√∂lich described her childhood as very strict, deprived of any luxury and devoted to Lutheranism and hard work, and stated that she was educated in history, reading, writing, household tasks and religion. She resisted marrying for many years because she wished to devote herself to agriculture, but she continued to do so after marriage in 1735; both before and after her marriage, she was the owner of the estate √ñverbo, which had a blast furnace where she made pig iron. In 1741-42, she became the first of her gender to be published by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences with three books in agricultural science depicting her own experiences and suggesting various inventions in agriculture. The only other female to be published by the Academy of Sciences during the age of liberty was Eva Ekeblad. In 1759, she published a history book, making her the first female historian of her country. In 1768, she became one of two Swedish women, alongside Fran√ßoise Marguerite Jani√ßon, to participate in the political debate on economic policies of the state who published herself without a pseudonym during the age of liberty. She was also a poet known for her funeral poems. Works * Et ankommit bref om s√•ningsmachinen under namn af Lotta Triven.

On May 22, the first official single from Black Flag, \\"Pe$o\\" featuring rappers Pusha T and Meek Mill was released. On June 4, Machine Gun Kelly released a statement regarding the concept behind Black Flag and would later activate a countdown clock on his website that would release new content from Black Flag such as the album booklet, song previews, and even Black Flag itself; each time it struck zero. The clock counted down eleven times, with each countdown period being named \\"Operation:.....\\". On June 25, the \\"Operation: Complex Catastrophe\\" countdown hit zero and Machine Gun Kelly released a new track titled \\"Breaking News\\" along with an accompanying music video onto YouTube. The next day, Black Flag was released through the \\"Operation: Weapon Of Mass Destruction\\" countdown. Shortly after the release, Machine Gun Kelly would tweet: \\"To media and to fans: Black Flag is my 2nd ALBUM, please consider it and treat it as such.\\" Physical copies of the project will be available in limited quantities on Machine Gun Kelly's upcoming tour in promotion of Black Flag. On June 27, Machine Gun Kelly personally uploaded, edited, and commented on the lyrics for all the songs featured on Black Flag for the website Genius.com. The final countdown, \\"Operation: Unconventional Warfare\\" struck zero on July 16 and released a music video for \\"Black Tuxedo\\". The countdown clock has since been removed. Black Flag included a cover of \\"Swing Life Away\\". The cover has new verses written by Kelly, and features guest vocals by Kellin Quinn of Sleeping with Sirens. Rise Against approved of the cover, after Kelly wrote a letter to the band explaining that he \\"wouldn‚Äôt do anything to make them or their song look corny\\". Originally, Quinn had recorded vocals for an acoustic rendition, but Kelly decided against this, insisting that the cover be more melodic rock.http://noisecreep.com/machine- gun-kelly-heavy-metal/ Ramirez, Carlos (February 27, 2013). \\"Machine Gun Kelly: Rapper Reveals Why He's So Influenced by Metal and Punk Music (Interview)\\".
