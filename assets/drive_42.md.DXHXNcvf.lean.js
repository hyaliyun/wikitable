He wrote many articles in radical journals. In his later years he was active in the Committee of Social Defence (CDS), an organization that helped political prisoners and exiles. Early years Henri F√©lix Camille Beaulieu was born in Paris on 30 November 1870. His parents were Charles Beaulieu and Jeanne Beylie. a seamstress. At a young age he was a non- commissioned officer in the African Battalions, but was dismissed for \\"collective revolt and protest\\". On returning to the metropolis he mixed in libertarian circles in Montmartre and began to publish articles in La Revue Libertaire (1893‚Äì94). After anarchists staged several attacks in Paris in 1893 there was a wave of arrests. In January 1894 Beylie, Henri Gauche and Henri Guerin were arrested questioned by a judge. Gauche and Guerin were the editors of La revue libertaire (Paris, December 1893 ‚Äì February 1894). The three briefly took refuge in Brussels, Belgium. Naturist anarchist After his return to France Henri Beaulieu worked as a plumber for the Northern Railway, then in 1895 became a bank employee. He participated in \\"naturist\\" libertarian groups led by Henri Zisly and Jules Bariol in Paris. Between July 1894 and February 1898 Beaulieu, √âmile Gravelle and Henri Zisly published four numbers of L'√âtat Naturel which advocated naturism, vegetarianism and veganism. Between 1895 and 1898 the three men published the monthly La Nouvelle Humanit√©, which proclaimed that humans would be released from slavery through a healthy diet and outdoors living. Writing under the pseudonym Henri Beylie he contributed to various other libertarian publications. He was in contact with the paper Tribune Libre published in Charleroi, Pennsylvania by French miners who had emigrated to the US. On 10 September 1898 Beylie married Cl√©mentine Bontoux and found work as an accountant. The naturist group was dissolved in 1898, and he joined the fight to defend Alfred Dreyfus. In the summer of 1899 Beylie left this cause, dissatisfied with the way that S√©bastien Faure was handling the case. He continued to contribute to various anarchist publications. In 1901 another naturist group was formed, and from June to October 1901 Beylie edited Le Bulletin de l'Harmonie. In 1901 he also contributed to the Cercle d‚Äô√©tudes sociales (Circle of Social Studies: CES) in Paris. In February 1902 the naturist group dissolved due to disagreement between those such as Beylie and Zisly who thought it was necessary to make a radical break by retiring from the world, and those who thought the excesses of urban civilization could be moderated without sacrificing the benefits of progress. In 1902 Beylie and Georges Butaud co-founded the \\"milieu libre\\" anarchist society, with the goal of \\"creating and developing a free environment in France\\". Early in 1903 this gave rise to the Milieu Libre de Vaux (Free Commune of Vaux) located in Ess√¥mes-sur-Marne, Picardy. G. Butaud was the facilitator. From November 1903 the anarchist colony was the target of an attack some libertarian journalists, and the 5‚Äì12 December 1903 issue of Le Libertaire published a negative report on the colony. Beylie and Butaud answered in the colony's monthly bulletin of December 1903, giving a positive report of ten months of communism. However, in February 1907 the experiment came to an end. Anarcho-communist Cover of Le Militarisme. Ses causes, ses cons√©quences, les moyens de le combattre Brochure published by the groupe Germinal of Lyon, 1903 In December 1902 Beylie was one of the founders of the Ligue antimilitariste, along with fellow anarchists Georges Yvetot, Paraf- Javal, Albert Libertad and √âmile Janvion. This was to become the French section of the Association internationale antimilitariste (AIA), which was the subject of intense police surveillance. Beylie was secretary-treasurer of the league. In 1903 he published the brochure Le militarisme. Ses causes, ses cons√©quences, les moyens de le combattre. Beylie was a member of the First of May society, whose members were arrested on the night of 29 April 1906 when they were putting up a poster in the street of Paris called the Manifeste abstentionniste et antimilitariste, and were accused of anarchist propaganda. They were later pardoned. From 24‚Äì31 August 1907 he attended the International Anarchist Congress in Amsterdam with Pierre Monatte, Beno√Æt Broutchoux, Ren√© de Marmande, Am√©d√©e Dunois and others. In 1908 he joined the Anarchist Federation of the Seine and Seine-et-Oise. Beylie became a member of the Committee of Social Defence (CDS), an organization that helped political prisoners and exiles. From 1909 to 1912 he worked for the Bulletin du Comit√© de D√©fense Sociale. At the end of 1910 the police accused him of inciting soldier to abandon their arms and desert. In February 1912, representing the CDS, he was a member of the committee that prepared the funeral of Albert Aernoult. From March to May 1912 Beylie participated in the Anti-Parliamentary Revolutionary Committee (RAC) of the Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail (CGT). He led a campaign for abstention from the municipal elections in May. In December 1912 he participated on the board of Le Libertaire, and in 1913 the following year was a supporter of La Bataille Syndicaliste. Beylie was registered by the police in the Carnet B list of anarchists. With the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì18) he was mobilized in the 14th Territorial Infantry Regiment and assigned to an office job. In April and May 1918 he helped found the pacifist paper La Pl√®be. After the war he was again active in the CDS. He was a delegate to the congresses of the Anarchist Union (UA) in Paris in 1920 and 1923. At the 1923 congress he was elected to the board of Le Libertaire, to which he contributed. In March 1932 he was appointed secretary of the CDS. In January 1937 he was still secretary of CDS and working as an accountant in Paris. Henri Beylie died in 1944.

The core development team currently works out of Instituto Superior T√©cnico, Lisbon. The goal of this project is to develop a large suite of software products that schools can easily install and configure on their own organization, with very little resources. The project also works as advanced engineering training group for students of Instituto Superior T√©cnico, by giving them a realistic software development environment without the real pressures of a job. The motivation behind it is that by optimising the teaching process, there are increases in the speed of science and culture development and by doing so there is a faster societal development. History thumbProjecto F√©nix original logo The project started around 1999 when Instituto Superior T√©cnico felt the need of updating their student information systems, written originally in COBOL. The school started Project F√©nix as a research project involving several final degree projects with the objective to create a new software platform, called F√©nix, that would serve the school in their administrative needs. Right from the beginning the project released its software as open source, as a way for the academic community to contribute back and also for the system to serve as a teaching tool, particularly to Software Engineering students. Over the next 12 years the project grew to manage almost all the school tasks, from grading to parking. Although the system by 2012 covered a lot of school tasks, it was a monolithic platform, and was very hard to deploy it on another schools, requiring a team of specialized developers to do it. It was around this time, when the system started growing beyond one school, that the project restructured it, and rebranded itself into FenixEdu. The focus was to develop easy deployable, highly modular, pluggable and customizable pieces of software that schools could cherry pick to match their needs, requiring no more than one person to fully configure an installation. Over the next years, the original platform source code was cleaned, Instituto Superior T√©cnico specific code removed and sliced into individual modules, that could be reused and picked individually. Projects As of 2014, FenixEdu released four individual software packages: * FenixEdu Academic, an open source Student Information System * FenixEdu Learning, an open source Learning Management System * OddJet, a reporting library designed to work with OpenOffice documents. * Bennu, a web framework integrated with the Fenix Framework persistence system.

While the insurgency has been active in various forms since 1960, insurgent groups have recently redoubled their efforts after the 2011 jail break that freed G√©d√©on Kyungu Mutanga, who now commands the majority of the Katangese separatist groups. Since 2000, FDLR insurgents have been engaged in a low level military conflict with the FARDC and various Katangese separatist groups; the FDLR are mostly active in the north-eastern portion of Katanga province near the border with South Kivu. The conflict in the region has caused an exodus of around 600,000 refugees to various other parts of the DRC and an unknown number of civilians have died as a result of the conflict. Background Insurrection and political instability first appeared in Katanga immediately after Democratic Republic of the Congo's independence in 1960. The region attempted to create a breakaway state with the support of Belgium, which aimed to create a puppet state and gain access to the mineral rich region. The State of Katanga however failed to defend its independence during the Congo Crisis and was integrated into Congo in 1963. Between 1977 and 1978, Front for the National Liberation of the Congo sparked two major conflicts in the region known as Shaba I and Shaba II. A number of separatist groups have conducted a low intensity insurgency since the end of Shaba II, the main factions being Co-ordination for a Referendum on Self-determination for Katanga (CORAK) and Mai Mai Kata Katanga. On 9 September 2011, rebel leader G√©d√©on Kyungu Mutanga managed to escape the Kassapa prison where he was detained. Mutanga soon established the Mai Mai Kata Katanga a rebel faction aiming to create an independent Katanga state. Mutanga also established Mai Mai G√©d√©on effectively having two separate militia groups under his command. These two militias primarily operate in the Mitwaba, Manono and Pweto localities of Katanga Province; an area that has been nicknamed the \\"Triangle of Death' as a result of the conflict. Timeline alt= On 15 October 2004, rebels attacked the town of Kilwa, approximately 3,000 people fled into neighboring Zambia in the aftermath of the attack. On 20 October 2004, security forces recaptured Kilwa killing 30 insurgents and detaining rebel commander Alain Ilunga Mukalyi as well as several other rebels. On 23 May 2010, authorities apprehended 7 separatists belonging to CPK on charges of planning an attack on the Vangu military camp. Three AK- 47 rifles, Katangese flags as well as ritual fetishes were confiscated from the militants. On 23 November 2010, militants raided a village situated in the vicinity of Luena. On 26 November 2010, FARDC bombed rebel positions and engaged in clashes with insurgents in the area of Luena. A total of 6 people were killed, including 1 government soldier and 5 insurgents; 12 insurgents were also captured. Among those killed was rebel leader Yesu Mulongo. On 11 January 2011, FARDC recaptured the towns of Bendera, Wimbi, Kabimba and Lunga, previously controlled by FDLR. A total of 19 insurgents and 3 government soldiers were killed during the fighting. On 5 February 2011, Katangese Separatists seized control of the Luano airport in Lubambashi but were forced out of the area by members of the FARDC and the local police. One death was reported and local sources indicated that the attack may have been done by the insurgent group known as the CPK.

It was reported that 35 attacks rebel attacks occurred within the first four months of 2014, the incidents occurred in the Katangese territories of Kalemie, Manono, Mitaba, Pweto, and Moba. On 7 January 2014, Bakata Katanga separatists launched an attack on Lubumbashi, the attack was repelled by security forces after a skirmish in Kiziba, southeast of Lubumbashi. A total of 26 people were killed during the clashes, as scores of civilians fled the city. On 5 April 2014, FDLR guerrillas pillaged a number of villages and ambushed cargo trucks on Route Nationale 5, near Kabulo in Kalemie territory. On 19 May 2014, Congolese authorities detained Kata Katanga commander Fidel Ntumbi in the town of Mpyana. On 6 July 2014, the Congolese army retook the town of Wimbi previously occupied by elements of Mai Mai Yakutumba, the militants looted the town, stealing fuel, livestock and other material goods. On 7 August 2014, FDLR rebels ambushed a bus outside the village of Kanyangwe, killing one and seriously injuring two people. On 12 September 2014, a group of 10 militants shot dead a police officer along with his wife in the town of Malemba Nkulu, the rebels then proceeded to plunder the town, later torching 10 houses and taking 3 people hostage. On 16 September 2014, the Congolese military announced the take over of 11 towns previously controlled by Bakata Katanga rebels including: Ndela, Kabunda, Kishale, Paza, Nkokole, Muluvia, Kabala, Lubinda, Lenge Wa Bangi, Lenge Wa Bunga, and Kyungu. Mai Mai G√©d√©on commander Kafilo was recognised among those killed during clashes that took place earlier in September. On 26 September 2014, MONUSCO confirmed the death of Bakata Katanga commander Kasompobe, whose corpse was discovered on the shore of the Luvua river on September 12. On 27 September 2014, 6 Bakata Katanga militants were killed during fighting in the vicinity of Kingoma. In a separate event 2 Ma√Ø-Ma√Ø Yakutumba insurgents were detained in the village of Manyanga.

He holds a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair Tier in Major Depressive Disorder and Suicide. He is the sitting Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University, the Scientific Director of the Douglas Research Centre, and the Psychiatrist-in-Chief of the Centre int√©gr√© de sant√© et de services sociaux de l‚ÄôOuest-de-l‚Äô√éle-de-Montr√©al (CIUSSS ODIM), which includes the psychiatric departments of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, St. Mary's Hospital, Lakeshore General Hospital, and Ste. Anne's Hospital. He works at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, where he heads both the McGill Group for Suicide Studies and the Depressive Disorders Program, and is the co-director of the Douglas Bell-Canada Brain Bank. As a clinician and neuroscientist, his research focuses on examining the influence of life experiences on brain function, and their relationship to depression and suicide risk. Among his major contributions, published in over 500 peer- reviewed publications and 30 book chapters, is the first description of the long-term impact of childhood abuse on the brain, particularly how it affects the activity of key genes involved in the stress response.  Scientific contributions  Turecki's neurobiological work has focused strongly on the processes underlying depression and suicide. A defining moment in his career came from a collaboration with Michael Meaney and Moshe Szyf, in which they uncovered that early-life adversity epigenetically regulates the glucocorticoid receptor gene, a key component of response to stress. This groundbreaking study helped to reconcile the longstanding debate about the relative influences of genes and environment on behaviour (‚Äònature vs. nurture‚Äô debate), and garnered international attention, leading to Turecki's selection as the scientist of the year by Radio Canada/Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2009, along with Meaney and Szyf. Turecki's further research on the human brain explored the epigenetic control of genes related to stress- response systems, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in association with childhood abuse and suicide. The promising results obtained in studying the epigenetic control of the HPA axis prompted Turecki to expand his interest in the epigenetic regulation of the brain, focusing on mechanisms that may explain what happens when individuals are exposed to traumatic experiences early in their lives, as well as what epigenetic processes are involved in depression and suicide. In addition, his work has focused on epigenetic mechanisms explaining response to antidepressants. Turecki also conducts work aiming at refining the depression and suicide phenotype. His clinical work focuses on depression. He leads the Depressive Disorders Program, a clinical group that treats patients affected with major depression and integrates research projects into clinical practice. Two key aspects of this work are exploring how impulsive-aggressive behaviours contribute to suicide risk, and implementing novel protocols and standards in the field.  Personal life Turecki is married and has three children. He was born in La Plata, Argentina and moved to Montreal, Canada in 1994.  Recognition of work  Turecki is a fellow of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences and of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. His contributions have also been recognized through numerous prizes and awards. * 2005 William Dawson Scholar, McGill University * 2009 Scientist of the year Award, Radio Canada/CBC * 2009 Top 10 findings of the year, Qu√©bec Science * 2010 Celebrity of the week, La Presse * 2012 Heinz Lehmann Award, CCNP * 2012 Research Career Award, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention * 2014 Samarthji Lal Award for Mental Health Research, Graham Boeck Foundation * 2014 Top 10 findings of the year, Qu√©bec Science * 2015 Joel Elkes Award for Clinical Research, ACNP * 2016 L√©o-Pariseau Prize, Acfas * 2016 Distinguished Investigator Award, NARSAD * 2019 Margolese National Brain Disorders Prize, University of British Columbia * 2020 Sumitomo/Sunovion Brain Health Clinical Research Award, CINP  Selected publications  = Neurobiology studies =    * * = Clinical and behavioural studies of depression and suicide =  * References  External links  * MGSS * Douglas Research Centre * PubMed Search * Google Scholar Profile Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian psychiatrists Category:McGill University faculty Category:McGill University alumni Category:Canadian geneticists Category:Scientists from Montreal ","title":"Gustavo Turecki"},{"id":"44649614","text":"Ageneiosus magoi is a species of driftwood catfish of the family Auchenipteridae.

It should not be confused with the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius. History The site of the present church used to be occupied by a wooden church, following the form a Latin cross, erected in 1638, when Vilnius was part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and was known as Wilno. Associated with the church was a convent, opened in 1567. After a fire gutted the wooden church in the 18th century, a stone church was erected in 1749‚Äì1753 in the Baroque style, with details of the interior in Roccoco style. It was designed by Johann Christoph Glaubitz, an architect of German descent who was noted for developing a Lithuanian school of Baroque architecture, known as Vilnian Baroque. Architecture In the 19th century, when Vilnius was part of the Russian Empire, several Byzantine Revival architectural elements were added to the church, but it nevertheless retained its essentially Baroque form. Indeed, the added Orthodox frescoes, Iconostasis and dome enhanced its magnificence, as did the addition of deep blue and green interior decor. Unusual in an Orthodox church are the Scagliola (simulated marble) sculptures. A new reliquary was added in 1853. In the crypt lie the remains of Saints Anthony, John, and Eustathios. A tradition of the church is to cloak them in black during Lent, in white at Christmas and in red on other major religious holidays. Present The Church of the Holy Spirit is the major Orthodox church in Lithuania, and it is affiliated with two Orthodox monasteries: The Monastery of the Holy Spirit and the Convent of Saint Mary Magdalen. These are the only remaining Orthodox monasteries in Lithuania.

Less than a month later, the Whites were forced to evacuate from Novorossiysk, the Armed Forces of South Russia and the South Russian Government were dissolved. Denikin resigned and delegated power to General Pyotr Wrangel, who established the new Government of South Russia in Sevastopol and the new Russian Army, commonly known as the Army of Wrangel in April. During mid-1920, South Russia's territory had receded to the White stronghold on Crimea, a highly defensible location that had repelled several Red offensives. The Whites were defeated at the Siege of Perekop in November 1920, losing the highly strategic Perekop Isthmus and leaving Crimea vulnerable to Red invasion. Wrangel ordered the evacuation of Crimea, effectively ending his government and the Southern Front in Red Victory. South Russia ceased to exist after the Red conquest of Crimea, and its territory was absorbed by Soviet Russia, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Black Army.

According to the myth, Dohkwibuhch began the creation of the world in the east, giving a new language to each group that he created. When he reached the Puget Sound, he liked the area so much that decided to stop there. He then took the remaining languages and spread them around, explaining why the tribes of the area have so many different languages. Since they were unable to talk to each other, the people were displeased with Dohkwibuhch. Dohkwibuhch had also made a mistake when making the sky. It was too low, and tall people would strike their heads on it. People could also enter the sky world by climbing trees. A group of wise men gathered to devise a plan to lift the sky. They decided that it could be done if everyone in the world lifted at the same time, when the wise men called \\"Yah-hoh\\", which meant \\"lift together\\" in all of their languages. However, when the time came, a group of three hunters were unaware of the plan. They had followed a herd of four elk into the sky world.

Early career Tuala was born in Samoa, but moved to New Zealand with his family aged 2 years old and grew up in South Auckland. Club career Tuala began his senior rugby career in New Zealand with the Counties Manukau Steelers, debuting during the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup season while only 20 years old. His ability to play in several positions across the backline saw him become an integral part of the Steelers squad and earn over 50 ITM Cup caps. He was also involved in the Chiefs Development squads in both 2010 and 2011. On 3 February 2015, Tuala signed for English club Northampton Saints in the Aviva Premiership until the end of the 2014-15 season. However, he signed a new deal with Northampton, making his move permanent at Franklin's Gardens. It could be said that while Tuala has been at Saints for two season now, his breakthrough year was this past season (2016/17). The full back secured his place within the starting lineup on a weekly basis while George North was away on international duty and retained that on the wing's return, crossing the whitewash five times that season for Saints. Teaming up with the rest of Saints' backline to form a formidable force when firing, Tuala was awarded Saints' Supporter' Breakthrough Player of the Year award at the 2016/17 End of Season Awards, pipping newcomers Nic Groom and Juan Pablo Estelles to the post. Most recently Tuala helped Saints secure a place in European Rugby Champions Cup, scoring the match winning try as Saints beat Stade Francais by one point to clinch the final top-tier European spot. International career Despite being born in Samoa, Tuala's early international experience came with New Zealand. He was a member of the New Zealand Under-20 wider squad in 2009 and the New Zealand sevens wider training group in 2012. However, in January 2012 it was announced that Tuala had withdrawn from the New Zealand sevens squad to focus on gaining international recognition with his native Samoa. His ambitions were realized 2 years later when he was named in the Samoan squad for the 2014 end-of-year rugby union tests and made his international debut on 14 November 2014 in a 23-13 victory over in Vannes, France. Most recently Tuala was called up, alongside fellow Saint Ken Pisi, to the Samoan squad for the 2017 internationals.

The uniform use of this standard enables the flexible connection of decentralized power plants to virtual power plants and Smart Grid applications. VHPready was originally developed by Vattenfall on the basis of international communication standards and was initially used to network its own plants. At the beginning of 2014, Vattenfall handed over the standard with all rights to the Industrieforum VHPready e. V., which had been significantly prepared by the Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems (FOKUS) and took over the further development and dissemination as an international industry standard.  Background In the wake of the energy revolution, decentralised power generation plants such as wind power plants, photovoltaic plants, biogas plants, small hydropower plants and mini or micro combined heat and power plants, as well as controllable consumers and energy storage systems, are becoming increasingly important. One approach to integrating them into the energy supply and exploiting synergies is to interconnect these decentralised plants to form virtual power plants. These can help to intelligently orchestrate and reconcile consumption and generation, which should lead to better integration of renewable energies and decentralised plants, a reduction in the maximum load on the grids and cost advantages for market participants. An intelligent power grid (see Smart Grid) plays a key role in this. Various price mechanisms, some of which are already in use today (see standard power), can serve as an incentive for providing this so-called flexibility. Up to now, the connection of the plants has been carried out by manufacturer-specific information and communication standards using different data models. With the aid of an open industry standard and certification of the decentralised plants, the process for connection and pre-qualification is to be facilitated and shortened.  History 2011 * Vattenfall develops the standard on the basis of international communication standards, initially to network its own plants. 2012 * Vattenfall releases version 3.0 of the VHPready specification 2013 * Due to the interest in the specification, it was decided to develop an open industry standard for general use. 2014 * Foundation of the Industrieforum VHPready e.V. as a competition-neutral and cross-sector platform for the further development of the standard and the certification of standard-compliant plant components. * Vattenfall hands over the standard with all results and rights to the industrial forum VHPready e. V. 2015 * Publication of the white paper of the specification VHPready 4.0, developed by the members. * Foundation of VHPready Services GmbH, which is responsible for the implementation and international dissemination of the standard. 2017 * Publication of the specification VHPready 4.0 at the E-world energy & water 2019 * The remaining members of the VHPready e.V. agreed on liquidation of VHPready e.V. in a general meeting on 29.11.2019. https://www.vhpready.com/en/vhpready/  Scope and certification  VHPready comprises different requirements regarding system configuration as well as necessary control and measuring elements. Supported plant types range from power generation plants to energy storage units and consumers. Certification is carried out by VHPready Services GmbH and accredited testing laboratories. After receipt of an application for the VHPready certificate, testing laboratories are commissioned to test the respective systems on the basis of the technical requirements. The process is divided into two stages: first, the systems are tested against specifications by means of conformity tests. They begin with the static testing of the properties specified by the manufacturer. This is followed by the verification of the dynamic properties, i.e. tests under controlled conditions. In the second stage, end-to-end tests are carried out using reference systems. After successful testing and acceptance of the test report by VHPready Services GmbH, the systems receive a product-related VHPready certificate. Changed products require recertification.  Technical details  In order to obtain the VHPready certificate, the plants must meet certain minimum requirements. These ensure that a technical connection to a virtual power plant runs smoothly. They concern, among other things, the connection protocols used, technical performance requirements, security of data transmission and types of commands to the plants. The focus is on data communication, remote monitoring and remote control of the equipment. The current version of the specification is VHPready 4.0. The functional core of VHPready 4.0 is an extensive data point list. It supports the integration of different energy systems into virtual power plants. The telecontrol protocol IEC 60870-5-104 or a modelling according to IEC 61850-7-420 is used for this purpose. In addition to a plant park with a network of different energy systems, this data point list enables the integration of block-type thermal power stations (CHPs), wind power and solar plants, heat pumps, batteries, electric heaters, boiler and buffer storage. In addition, there are data points for meters and external signalling contacts.[8] The security of data transmission is guaranteed by the establishment of a virtual private network (VPN) based on OpenVPN with SSL/TLS connections (Secure Sockets Layer, Transport Layer Security).[9] An essential goal of VHPready is the definition of subsets or profiles of the standards used, so that only the profile has to be named during certification and project realization. Project-specific agreements on the details of the standards are thus largely eliminated. All tests for certification to the VHPready standard follow internationally standardized methods and techniques as defined by ISO/IEC and ETSI.  Members of Industry Alliance VHPready e.V.  The member companieshttps://www.vhpready.com/en/vhpready/members/ participated in the initiative for the integration and standardization of decentralized energy systems. The members include manufacturers of system components, providers of software and IT services, network operators, test service providers as well as companies from research and development. The members of the Industry Alliance VHPready e.V. designed new application areas for new use cases of the VHPready specifications. In working groups the technical advancements of the industry standard were compiled together, application scenarios have been developed, testing and certification processes were modeled as well as positions and strategies of the industry forum for the public work were conceived. The development statuses were available to the member companies ahead of time. This allowed them to test the VHPready communication in their products and in interaction with the systems of other member companies even before the publication, for example during a Plugfest.

He specialised in the technical utilisation of scientific results rather than engaging in theoretical research.  Marriages and children  In 1888, he married Elvina Duling, daughter of William Duling, and the couple had one daughter and two sons: Frederick Charles Eastick, Melita Florence Eastick and Douglas Martineau Eastick.  Sugar refining  In 1880, excited by sugar‚Äôs recent rise into the ubiquity of British life, Charles together with his two brothers (also chemists) John Joseph and Samuel began a sugar analysis and consulting practice in Trinity Square in the City of London. In 1881 Abram Lyle together with his three sons bought two wharves in Plaistow, East London to construct a refinery for making syrup. Impressed by the Eastick brothers' ground-breaking work, Abram Lyle invited the brothers to set up a laboratory at the new Plaistow Wharf refinery, where John Joseph became the first chemist at Lyle's, ably assisted by his brother Charles. Initially the analysis of raw sugar was established for the purpose of establishing price and duty payments, however in 1883 tough times importing cargoes of sugar bring production to a near- halt, so Charles and John Joseph experimented with the refining process, of the bitter molasses-brown treacle-hitherto a waste by-product of sugar refining-into an eminently palatable syrup with the viscosity, hue and sweetness of honey, leading to Charles formulating the first version of the world's oldest branded product, golden syrup. Under the leadership of his elder brother John Joseph the two brothers formulated the special methods of making brewers' saccharum, inverted sugar and golden syrup. By 1890 John Joseph was succeeded at Lyle's by his brother-in-law Lawrence John De Whalley, who went on to perfect many improvements in the refinery process and control at Lyle's refinery. Meanwhile John Joseph went to the Australian sugar refinery in Melbourne (and subsequently Bundaberg, Queensland), and Charles left Lyle's to run London's second largest sugar refinery, Martineaus in Whitechapel. During the Great War Charles assumed a national role, being responsible for administering the UK wartime sugar rationing quotas, for which he was awarded an MBE in the 1918 Birthday Honours. On his brother's return from Australia, Charles and John Joseph continued the analysis and consulting of sugar through the Newland Brothers practice in Dunstan Hill (inherited from John Joseph's father-in-law) and together with their brother Samuel, formulated 11 sugar refining related patents between 1880 and 1919. During the 1920s, only small amounts of specialised sugars were being imported to Britain as it was not economic for the larger refineries to manufacture these, so Charles saw an opportunity to manufacture brewers' saccharum, inverted sugar and golden syrup for brewers, bakers and confectioners, which led him to establish a specialist factory Ragus Sugars in West London on the new Slough trading estate. At the Martineaus refinery Charles was joined by his eldest son Fredrick as managing director and later by his eldest grandson Bernard, who became production director until a year after the business was sold to Manbre and Garton in 1961. Charles' youngest son Douglas took over the running of the Ragus operation, but on joining the RAF during the Second World War, Charles came out of retirement and had time for one last invention, \\"Golden Shower\\" crystallised golden syrup. This was sold in grocery shops as a replacement for honey. Charles died two years after the end of the war and in the 1950s Ragus passed to Charles' youngest grandsons Ronald and Barry, and the company today continues to be run by Charles' great-grandsons, Peter, James and Benjamin.

He is currently a partner of Goldstein & Orr and is Board Certified by the State Bar of Texas in Criminal Law and Criminal Appellate Law. Early life and education Goldstein was born in Santa Maria, California in 1944. At the time, his father, Eli Goldstein, was a lawyer working for the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) at the Army Air Force Base in Santa Maria. His parents later moved to San Antonio, Texas, where Goldstein grew up.Gordon, Stephen H. ‚ÄúGerry Goldstein, for the Defense.‚Äù San Antonio Lawyer. March‚ÄìApril 2013. Pg. 5 Goldstein has a bachelor's degree in art from Tulane University and received his law degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1968. Career Goldstein joined his father's law firm in San Antonio. After a medical deferment from the Vietnam War, he partnered with Maury Maverick, Jr., a liberal leader in Texas politics, to defend conscientious objectors and civil rights cases.Swartz, Mimi. ‚ÄúThe High Times of Gerry Goldstein‚Äù Texas Monthly. April 1996 In 1970, Goldstein joined the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), and began building a reputation for defending drug charge cases after he represented the organization's founder, Keith Stroup, after a drug bust. Goldstein represented a newly hired theater operator in San Antonio who had been arrested for showing the x-rated movie Deep Thoat in 1974. Goldstein won the case before the Supreme Court on appeal. Goldstein's 1978 appeal reversed the convictions in the Piedras Negras Jailbreak Case. In that case, the two men, Sterling Davis, Sr. and William McCoy Hill, entered the border city's jail in Mexico and freed fourteen American inmates charged with drug offenses. The U.S. government indicted the two men alleging that a sawed-off shotgun used during the raid violated gunrunning laws. The men went to prison. Goldstein won the appeal by arguing that the two men had unknowingly, as opposed to intentionally, violated the law because neither had known the length at which a sawed-off shotgun was illegal. He represented one of Texas House Speaker Billy Clayton's cronies in the kickback scandal known as Brilab in 1980. Goldstein represented a fringe Mormon group that advocates polygamy, regarding a raid of their Texas ranch. He represented the Yearning for Zion Ranch head Frederick Merril Jessop's case. The polygamist sect was investigated and prosecuted after a massive child-abuse investigation. Goldstein argued in court that although the multiple marriages were not common, the group had the right to their faith and privacy. Goldstein was elected president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association (TCDLA) in 1992 and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) in 1994 and 1995.Anderson, Patrick. ‚ÄúHigh in America: The True Story Behind NORML and the Politics of Marijuana.‚Äù Viking Press. 1981.

November 2009 Goldstein testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2010 and was critical of the Patriot Act. Goldstein's criticism centered around the detainment of his client, Dr. Al-Badr Al Hazmi, a radiology resident, who was arrested the morning after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Dr. Al Hazmi was later cleared of any wrongdoing but Goldstein highlighted the violation of Dr. Al Hazmi's Fifth Amendment protections in criticizing the Patriot Act and the authorization of the Federal government by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to monitor communications between suspected terrorist and their attorneys. He wrote an amicus brief on behalf of Manuel Noriega. Goldstein is also a former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a Fellow of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, American College of Trial Lawyers, and of the American Board of Criminal Lawyers.\\"International Academy of Trial Lawyers, American College of Trial Lawyers, American Board of Criminal Lawyers\\" In December 2019, Gerry Goldstein was selected as one of five 2019 recipients of the Texas Bar Foundation's Outstanding 50 Year Lawyer Award.

By his death in 1895, Wilkins was \\"a large stockholder in nearly every manufacturing enterprise in Greenville.\\"Greenville Mountaineer, December 7, 1895, 4. In 1867, Wilkins married Harriet Dawkins Cleveland (1843‚Äì1930) of Greenville, a woman wealthy in her own right; and in 1875 they settled in her hometown. On 93 acres Wilkins built a two-story brick mansion in the Italianate style, reflecting their prominence in the business and social life of the community. An 1898 publication described the house as \\"the finest home of any man in northern South Carolina.\\"Angelia Davis, \\"Greenville mansion on National Register,\\" Greenville News, August 8, 2016, 1.

When the now four-acre property was sold to a buyer who wished to demolish the house and build a nursing home and assisted living center, real estate developer Neil Wilson bought the house, intending to preserve and restore it. With assistance from the Palmetto Trust for Historic Preservation and members of the Greenville community, the necessary $720,000 to move the house was raised in 2014.

As a young man he was a persistent participant in Communist Resistance against the Nazi regime: between 1933 and 1945 much of his time was spent inside a succession of concentration camps and prisons. Life Bergold was born in Saxony. His father was a lithographer and porcelain painter who later worked as a library administrator. Wolfgang Bergold successfully completed his school career in 1932 and then started to study Economics, Russian and Chinese at the Dresden University of Technology. However, he was excluded in 1933. In 1930 he joined the Young Communists (KJVD), and in the same year was a co-founder of the Socialist School-students League. From 1932 he was also a member of the Free Socialist Student Fraternity. At the start of 1933 the Nazi Party took power and set about making membership all political parties other than their own illegal. Their leader, Adolf Hitler, was a powerful speaker who was particularly vitriolic about the Communist Party, Between 1933 and 1945 Wolfgang Bergold was imprisoned several times. In 1933 he was sentenced to a year's detention, and was interned, from April 1933 till July 1934, in the concentration camp at Hohnstein. On his release he resumed his illegal activities, Bergold was arrested again in December 1934, and in November 1935 he was sentenced to a year in prison for \\"Preparation of High treason\\". In 1935/36 he was interned in Dresden and in the Sachsenburg concentration camp. Between 1937 and 1941 he worked in as a clerk in Dresden. Along with Karl Stein and Herbert Bochow he was among the organisers of the Dresden Resistance Group. In April 1941, still in Dresden, Bergold was arrested again, and in 1942 sentenced to ten years imprisonment by the People's Court. With the exception of three months, from July till August 1943, in the 999th Light Afrika (punishment) division, he spent the rest of the Second World War in the prison at Waldheim. In May 1945 the war ended and Dresden found itself in that part of what had been Germany that was now designated by the winning side as the Soviet occupation zone (SBZ). Bergold was a member of the now legal Communist Party of Germany (KPD). However, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany had a plan for what now began to mutate into the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The plan involved a return to a one-party state, and in 1946 the KPD merged with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in this part of the country: members of both parties were invited, with a simple signature, to switch their party allegiance to the new Socialist Unity Party (SED). In 1946 Wolfgang Bergold joined the SED. From May till September 1945 he participated in the reconstruction of municipal administration in the Wilschdorf quarter of Dresden. Between September and November he worked as a teacher of German to officers from the Soviet Military Administration in Dresden. In 1945/46 he then worked in the Saxony region administration team, heading up the Statistics and Organisation division in the Department for Refugees. He underwent a training at the regional Party Academy and then in 1947, joined Sachsenwerk Radeberg, an electrical manufacturing business with a complex history which was now focusing on the manufacture of domestic radios and televisions. Bergold joined as a technical buyer, moving on to become secretary to the Commercial Director, and then, from 1948, as Culture Director and Party Secretary, during the period covering the enterprise's nationalisation. He stayed with VEM till 1954. Between 1953 and 1961 he undertook correspondence based study with the party's Karl Marx Academy in Berlin, but in Bergold's case this did not lead to a degree. In 1954/55 he worked as an instructor with the Dresden regional party leadership, and in 1955 joined the party's national Central Committee, becoming deputy section leader with the Department for Foreign Policy and International Relations. Between 1963 and 1968 Wolfgang Bergold served as his country's ambassador to Hanoi.Wolfgang Bergold zum Botschafter ernannt Neues Deutschland, 19 September 1963, p. 2 In 1969 he became Secretary of the Central Leadership of the so- called Committee of Anti-fascist resistance fighters in East Germany, and from 1970 he was secretary of the international umbrella organisation, the International Federation of Resistance Fighters ‚Äì Association of Anti-Fascists (FIR).Wolfgang Bergold.

Sumner is wise enough to know how to engage you in his theater and also smart enough to stand back and let you react on your own terms. The paintings are generous, funny and just a bit opaque... Echoes of Bay Area painting, flavors gleaned from Morandi, Guston and Magritte and a hint of Buster Keaton come together in his recent works through the filter of a sly, discerning intelligence.\\" Sumner was involved in a dialogue with artist Shane Guffogg and others in the non- profit space, Pharmaka in Downtown Los Angeles.

The basic models of this series are intercity bus Karosa C 934 and later produced C 954.  History  After completion of the project 800 Series in the early 1990s and several radically modified prototype vehicles of 700 series Karosa decided to \\"only\\" modernize range of 700 to 900. Production of a series of test series of new buses began in 1995, the serial production started in 1996 (B 931 city buses). A year later started production and other models (including the basic type C 934) Series 930 (standard bus) and 940 (articulated bus). Since 1996, was manufactured for the French market school bus R√©cr√©o, which became an unprecedentedly successful product. Compared to the 700 series changes were made in the driver's cab, which was equipped with a completely new layout dash with associated LED panel and \\"alarms\\". The steering wheel was adjustable and buses had electrically adjustable exterior mirrors. Visually, the design was improved according to current trends - front and back face was rounded and windscreen was large, undisturbed by columns. Otherwise, the 900 series buses were designed from the ground up based on the previous model. A certain exception was the wiring, which was completely redesigned in terms of Western customs. Partial Innovation 900 series took place in 1999. For example, at the municipal performance was in front of a lowered floor of 100 mm. Also, system control functions, and the door has been changed. Emphasis was placed on meeting European standards in the field of ecology and safety. Thus, an innovated line was rated as 900 E (E = evolution). Radical modernization of the 900 series touched in years 2001 and 2002, when Karosa began producing buses series 950 (standard bus) and 960 (articulated bus) and also ended production of the series 930 and 940. Modernization itself didn¬¥t change only on the outer the appearance of the bus. Modernisation was needed because of the entry into force of EURO 3 emission standards, which led to the introduction of engines Iveco that comply with this standard. Also a leading independent swing axle was remowed, and was replaced by rigid axle ≈†koda or RI75. In interurban cars C 954/955 and coach LC 956 has been cooling moved from the front radiator to the right side of the rear overhang, i.e. next to the engine. In autumn 2003 were again slightly modified production buses (the type designation was added the letter E). Modification consisted among others in better ventilation of the engine compartment (adding the ventilation grilles in the rear panel) and the glued glazing. Production of the 900 series buses, which was ended during the year 2006 was completed at the end of January 2007. Successor in production have become the new buses from Irisbus. A special category is a remote and not very widespread buses (Coach) Karosa LC 937 and LC 957. The first - LC 937 (GT 11), which other cars too unlike the 900 series, was produced from 1994 to 1996. Coach LC 957 (HD 12) with a raised floor was a successor to the LC 757 and its production lasted from 1997 to 1999. A total of 13,071 units of buses series 900 were made.  Designation  For new buses reserved Karosa 900 series, thus 9xx.

The polymer is derived from the molecular backbone of carrageenan.  Terminology  The name \\"poligeenan\\" was confirmed in 1988 by the United States Adopted Names (USAN) Council. The Council is sponsored by the American Medical Association, the American Pharmaceutical Association, and the US Pharmacopeial Convention Inc. Prior to 1988, poligeenan was referred to as \\"degraded carrageenan\\" in the scientific literature. The terms \\"poligeenan\\" and \\"degraded carrageenan\\" were often used interchangeably in research articles and reports.Beattie, et al. 1970. \\"A Study of Orally-Administered Degraded Carrageenan in the Baboon\\". Food. Cosmet. Toxicol. 8:257-266. The use of the term \\"degraded carageenan\\" caused confusion, which resulted in the attribution of the negative observations associated the polymer being attributed to carrageenan.McKim JM. 2014. ‚ÄúFood additive carrageenan: Part I: A critical review of carrageenan in vitro studies, potential pitfalls, and implications for human health and safetyWeiner ML. 2014. ‚ÄúFood additive carrageenan: Part II: A critical review of carrageenan in vivo safety studies. Poligeenan and carrageenan are completely different products.  Usage  = Diagnostic = The primary use for poligeenan is for clinical diagnostic applications, and specifically the suspension of barium sulfate slurries used in X-ray studies of the mouth, throat, and esophagus during swallowing. For this application, poligeenan delivers three essential properties: First, its viscosity imparts lubricity to make the slurry easier to swallow. Second, this same viscosity is high enough to maintain full suspension of all barium sulfate particles during the complete X-ray procedure. Third, the high charge density of the poligeenan solution (ester sulfate units) prevents caking or aggregation of the barium sulfate particles during long-term storage of ready- to-use slurry products, these being easily reconstituted by shaking. The combination of these three application properties necessitates poligeenan to have molecular weights in the range 10-20 kDa. = Experimental research = In 1969, Adrian Julian Marcus and James Watt demonstrated that poligeenan could induce gastrointestinal lesions in animal models, which was followed by decades of medical research using the substance to study inflammatory bowel disease. = Food = Poligeenan is not an approved food additive in the United States. The low molecular weight of poligeenan precludes it from exhibiting functionality in food. The International Agency for Research on Cancer assigned poligeenan to carcinogenic risk category 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans).IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Human. Agents Classified by the IARC Monographs Volumes 1-110. Updated List 23 October, 2014 Unlike poligeenan, carrageenan is an approved food additive21 C.F.R. ¬ß172.620 with an extensive toxicology data base that has been reviewed by regulatory bodies and provides scientific evidence for safe inclusion in foods.  Production  Poligeenan is produced by the harsh acid degradation of carrageenan. Carrageenan in solution is processed at low pH (~1.0) and high temperature () for up to six hours until the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) has been reduced to the range 10,000 ‚Äì 20,000 daltons (10-20 kDa). The resulting poligeenan solution is neutralized and spray dried to a fine powder.

It is a predominantly working-class residential area, bounded on the north by Capitol Avenue, the east by Lafayette Street, the south by Madison and Hamilton Streets, and on the west by Interstate 84. The neighborhood was developed between about 1850 and 1930, and still contains a remarkable concentration of residential housing from that period. The entire neighborhood, covering more than and including more than 900 buildings, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description Frog Hollow takes its name from the marshy conditions in the low land near what is now the corner of Broad and Ward streets. Most of the area was farmland until 1852 when the Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company constructed a factory, beginning the area's transformation into a major industrial area. Although not the first factory to be situated along now-buried Park River, Sharps located there specifically to take advantage of the railroad line that had been constructed along the river in 1838. After the Sharps Rifle Company failed in 1870, the Weed Sewing Machine Company took over its factory and soon surpassed the Colt Armory in nearby Coltsville in size. Inspired by a British-made, high-wheel bicycle, or velocipede, he saw at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, industrialist Albert Pope bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States. Wanting to contract out his first order, however, Pope approached George Fairfield of Hartford, and the Weed Sewing Machine Company produced Pope's first run of bicycles in 1878. Bicycles proved to be a huge commercial success and production in the Weed factory expanded, with Weed making every part but the tires, and by 1890, demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market. That year, Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the Pope Manufacturing Company. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near the turn of the century when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from over-production amidst falling demand. In an effort to save his business, Pope opened a Motor Carriage Department and turned out electric carriages, beginning with the \\"Mark III\\" in 1897. Pope's venture might have made Hartford the capital of the automobile industry were it not for the ascendency of Henry Ford and a series of pitfalls and patent struggles that outlived Pope himself. After his business failed, Pope donated a parcel park to provide recreational facilities for neighborhood families. Today, the park provides recreational facilities for neighborhood families. Park Street has also been called \\"New England's Spanish Main Street\\" because of the predominantly Puerto Rican population and merchants. Former Hartford Mayor Eddie Perez hoped to attract new merchants looking to expand their businesses into Hartford and in 2005, plans were first floated to spend $64 million on a project at the intersection of Park Street and Main Street. Original plans included two luxury condo towers, some retail, and a massive main square‚Äîor Plaza Mayor, as it came to be known. The plan later got smaller in size, and was eventually shelved entirely during the Great Recession. The neighborhood is home to Hartford Superior Court, Hartford Community Court, Family Court, Trinity College, The Learning Corridor, The Lyceum Resource and Conference Center, and Broad Street Juvenile Court. Residential construction in Frog Hollow began around 1850, with the construction of Greek Revival houses along Grand Street, and continued with Italianate houses, including a number of duplexes, along Affleck Street. The major building boom in the area took place between 1890 and 1910, when houses, schools, churches, and commercial properties were developed in large numbers. Much of this housing was multi- unit housing, with a locally distinctive \\"perfect six\\" wood frame building, three stories in height with two units per story, coming to typify the housing built at that time. A significant number of triple deckers (one unit per floor) were also built.

Bacha posh translates from Dari as \\"dressed up like a boy.\\" It is a term used in Afghanistan and in this book to describe children who are born as girls but are dressed up, raised and treated as if they were boys. The girls will usually serve as a son for the family until she hits puberty. However, the book also delves deeper into those bacha posh that remain boys even after puberty. It is written by journalist and foreign correspondent Jenny Nordberg and was published on 16 September 2014. It was later released on 30 September in the UK.  Synopsis  The book follows the stories of many women who are or who have been bacha posh. It also offers the insight of mothers considering bacha posh for her newborn daughters. Some families who have only a daughter or multiple daughters will designate their children as sons instead. The communities in which they live are often tolerant of this for the span of their childhood. The experiences of these individuals give personal accounts of how some women handle the treatment of girls in modern day Afghanistan. There is tremendous importance placed on being male or having male children. To grow up as a boy instead of as a girl in Afghanistan offers the child freedom and autonomy that young girls do not have access to. Oftentimes the mother is judged as well for not bearing a son.  Characters  Azita is a middle class mother of four daughters. Her fourth daughter, Mehran, is to become a bacha posh. She buys her clothing and a haircut to fit her new identity as a six-year-old boy. Azita wants to give Mehran the freedom to play sports, open communication, and activities that young boys can enjoy. Additionally, Azita herself was a bacha posh as a young girl, which allows her a deeper insight into their plight within Afghanistan. Zahra is a teenage bacha posh. She does not enjoy the treatment of Afghan women and wishes to remain a boy. She defies her parents‚Äô attempt to transition her into womanhood. Zahra wants to hold onto the freedoms she is given as a boy, and wishes to work and support herself without marriage or a family.

She was honored by the Government of India, in 2012, with the fourth highest Indian civilian award of Padma Shri. Biography Binni Yanga was born on 7 July 1958 in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh to late Binni Jaipu, a former political assistant at Lower Subansiri district and Binni Yanya, known for her efforts for the revival of traditional handlooms, as the elder of their two daughters, the younger being Gumri Ringu, the incumbent chairman of Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Women. She did her education at Banasthali Vidyapith, Rajasthan and during her student days, she formed a girls' forum, All Subansiri District Girls Welfare Association. After her studies, she started her career as a teacher. During this period, she set up an adult education and nursery centre in 1979 and, later, a shelter home for destitute girls. In 1987, Yanga joined Arunachal Police Force, when the first batch of women officers were inducted in 1987. After only a year of service with the police force, she resigned in 1988 to enter social service on a full-time basis. Binni Yanga was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2007 but carried on with her activities. She lived in Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh and owned Oju Craft Centre, a small enterprise employing 200 workers. She died on 3 September 2015. Oju Welfare Association and social career Binni Yanga registered the adult education and nursery centre she started in 1979 as a society in 1988, under the name Oju Welfare Association (OWA). The centre has grown over the years into an organization of larger proportions, covering a number of divisions, each catering to a specified purpose. OWA maintains a free educational institution in Seppa with a student strength of 100 boys and girls, a children's home, Shishu Greh, home to 150 orphaned children, Short Stay Home, a temporary place of residence with a capacity to house 45 destitute girls or women, a working women's hostel, a family counselling centre and a women's help line. They also run a girls' school, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya at Jang in Tawang district, a secondary school following CBSE syllabus and a vocational training centre. OWA also hosts the central government agencies, Jan Shiksha Sansthan and State Resource Centre in its premises. Yanga organized social awareness campaigns and seminars on health and other issues and was also involved with the promotion of traditional crafts of India for which she has founded Himgiri Multi-purpose Co-operative Society, a marketing agency for the rural artisans. The society has participated in many national and international exhibitions in countries such as UK, South Africa and Bhutan. Positions Binni Yanga was a former member of the National Planning Commission of India and has held the chairs of the Jan Shikshan Sansthan, and Arunachal Pradesh State Resource Centre, both nodal agencies under the Ministry of Human Resource Development (India). She was a member of the executive committees of the National Literacy Mission Authority and the Khadi and Village Industries Commission. She also served as Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Women, Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED), (a Ministry of Tribal Affairs undertaking), the Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship, Guwahati and the District Rural Health Mission, Yupia, as a member. She was the secretary of Himgiri Multipurpose Cooperative Society Limited, Naharlagun and Arunachal Pradesh Women's Voluntary Association. She was also a member of Muskaan Society, Papum Pare Juvenile Justice Board, Rama Krishna Mission Hospital, Itanagar and Country Women Association of India. She also served in the executive committee of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, Itanagar. Awards and recognitions Binny Yanga received Dr. Durga Bai Deshmukh Award in 2000 followed by the COSIA Entrepreneur Award in 2009-10 from the Chamber of Small Industry Associations. A recipient of the NCDC Award of cooperative Excellence, Yanga received the National Tribal Award and IFFCO Sahakarita Ratna Award in 2012.

It may be viewed as linking Huygens' principle of optics with Jacobi's Principle of mechanics.Kemble, E.C. (1937), pp. 7‚Äì10.Lanczos, C. (1949/1970). Lanczos wrote on p. 136: \\"[Maupertuis] ... thus pointed to that remarkable analogy between optical and mechanical phenomena which was observed much earlier by John Bernoulli and which was later fully developed in Hamilton's ingenious optico- mechanical theory. This analogy played a fundamental role in the development of modern wave-mechanics.\\"Synge, J.L. (1954). On p. 2, Synge writes: \\"... the analogy between Newtonian mechanics and geometrical optics is completed only when we supplement the former by thinking of waves in association with the paths of particles. This completion was actually present in Hamilton's theory, since he made it so wide as to include both corpuscular and wave theories of light, and in the former interpretation his surfaces of constant action are the waves in question. Thus, since the time of Hamilton we have actually had what might be called 'Newtonian geometrical mechanics', based on the principle of Maupertuis, , where is given in terms of energy by .\\"Messiah, A. (1961), pp. 53‚Äì55.Arnold, V.I. (1974/1978), p. 252. According to Cornelius Lanczos, the analogy has been important in the development of ideas in quantum physics. According to Erwin Schr√∂dinger, for micromechanical motions, the Hamiltonian analogy of mechanics to optics is inadequate to treat diffraction, which requires it to be extended to a vibratory wave equation in configuration space.Schr√∂dinger, E. (1926/1928), p. ix. Huygens' principle The propagation of light can be considered in terms of rays and wavefronts in ordinary physical three-dimensional space. One may consider an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium with smoothly distributed properties that are described by an index of refraction that is a well-behaved function of position. Huygens' principle governs the propagation of a wavefront as it can be derived from Fermat's principle. The wavefronts are two-dimensional curved surfaces. The rays are one-dimensional curved lines.Arnold, V.I. (1974/1978), p. 250. Thus, a wave is a foliated set of moving two-dimensional surfaces. In classical physics, it is not part of the definition of a wave that it be distinctly vibratory. One difference between wave and particle conceptions is thus in the spatial dimensionality of their moving objects. On one hand, a ray can be regarded as the orbit of a particle of light. It successively punctures the wave surfaces. The successive punctures can be regarded as defining the trajectory of the particle. On the other hand, a wave-front can be regarded as a level surface of displacement of some quantity, such as electric field intensity, hydrostatic pressure, particle number density, oscillatory phase, or probability amplitude. Then the physical meaning of the rays is less evident. This is wave‚Äìparticle duality for a single particle in ordinary three-dimensional physical space or for a wave of some property of a medium with a spatial distribution of properties that is mostly continuous but not homogeneous. Extended Huygens' principle Going beyond ordinary three- dimensional physical space, one can imagine a higher dimensional abstract configuration \\"space\\", with a dimension a multiple of 3. In this space, one can imagine again rays as one-dimensional curved lines. Now the wavefronts are hypersurfaces of dimension one less than the dimension of the space. Such a multi-dimensional space can serve as a configuration space for a multi- particle system. Classical limit of the Schr√∂dinger equation Albert Messiah considers a classical limit of the Schr√∂dinger equation. He finds there an optical analogy. The trajectories of his particles are orthogonal to the surfaces of equal phase. He writes \\"In the language of optics, the latter are the wave fronts, and the trajectories of the particles are the rays. Hence the classical approximation is equivalent to the geometric optics approximation: we find once again, as a consequence of the Schr√∂dinger equation, the basic postulate of the theory of matter waves.\\"Messiah, A. (1961), pp. 224‚Äì225. History Hamilton's optico-mechanical analogy played a part in the thinking of Schr√∂dinger, one of the originators of quantum mechanics. Section 1 of his paper published in December 1926 is titled \\"The Hamiltonian analogy between mechanics and optics\\".Schr√∂dinger, E. (1926) p. 1049. Section 1 of the first of his four lectures on wave mechanics delivered in 1928 is titled \\"Derivation of the fundamental idea of wave mechanics from Hamilton's analogy between ordinary mechanics and geometrical optics\\".Schr√∂dinger, E. (1928), p. 1. In a brief paper in 1923, de Broglie wrote : \\"Dynamics must undergo the same evolution that optics has undergone when undulations took the place of purely geometrical optics.\\"de Broglie, L. (1923). In his 1924 thesis, though de Broglie did not name the optico- mechanical analogy, he wrote in his introduction \\"... a single principle, that of Maupertuis, and later in another form as Hamilton's Principle of least action ... Fermat's ... principle ..., which nowadays is usually called the principle of least action. ... Huygens propounded an undulatory theory of light, while Newton, calling on an analogy with the material point dynamics that he created, developed a corpuscular theory, the so-called \\"emission theory\\", which enabled him even to explain, albeit with a contrived hypothesis, effects nowadays considered wave effects, (i.e., Newton's rings).\\"de Broglie, L. (1924). In the opinion of L√©on Rosenfeld, a close colleague of Niels Bohr, \\"... Schr√∂dinger [was] inspired by Hamilton's beautiful comparison of classical mechanics and geometrical optics ...\\"Rosenfeld, L. (1971/1979), on p. 286. The first textbook in English on wave mechanicsJammer, M. (1966), p. 366. devotes the second of its two chapters to \\"Wave mechanics in relation to ordinary mechanics\\". It opines \\"... de Broglie and Schr√∂dinger have turned this false analogy into a true one by using the natural Unit or Measure of Action, , .... ... We must now go into Hamilton's theory in more detail, for when once its true meaning is grasped the step to wave mechanics is but a short one‚Äîindeed now, after the event, almost seems to suggest itself.\\"Biggs, H.F. (1927), pp. 50, 52. According to one textbook, \\"The first part of our problem, namely, the establishment of a system of first-order equations satisfying the space-time symmetry condition, can be solved in a very simple way, with the help of the analogy between mechanics and optics, which was the starting point for the development of wave mechanics and which can still be used‚Äîwith reservations‚Äîas a source of inspiration.\\"Frenkel, J.

Merrie Melodies color cartoon short supervised by Chuck Jones (credited as \\"Charles M. Jones\\" on the original issue). The short was released on September 5, 1942. Plot A man is relaxing inside his cabin, listening to his radio; outside, a red fox is on the prowl. With apparent sinister intent, the animal creeps to the door then springs into the house, but rather than attack the man, he steals the radio. At a distance from the house, the fox pulls out an ax and starts destroying the radio. Two crows on a tree branch above are confused, and one asks, \\"What's bitin' you anyhow?\\" The fox begins telling them, via flashbacks: While scrounging for food in trash cans outside the same cabin, the fox overhears an announcer on the radio saying that foxes are in style this year for well-dressed ladies. Badly misinterpreting this message, the fox pictures himself as the pampered pet of a wealthy, adoring owner, and rushes to the Sterling Silver Fox Farm (named in the advertisement) to put himself up for adoption. At the farm, the fox inserts the tip of his tail into a fox trap, but the trapper points out that the trap is for silver foxes only, and kicks the fox into a nearby garbage heap. The fox scrounges a can of silver paint and coats himself with it, repeating the ruse and this time getting himself eagerly scooped up by the trapper. Inside the farm, the faux silver fox is told by an actual silver fox in the cage next to his that they are escaping that night. The painted fox laughs and says he is quite happy to stay, and the silver fox states that he will be joining their break-out, \\"or else...\\" and runs his finger across his throat. Again, the painted fox badly misinterprets this as meaning the silver fox is threatening to kill him if he does not go along. Nervous and looking for an excuse to stay, he points out that his cage is locked and there is no key. For answer, the silver fox bites down hard on the nail file he has been holding, creating a perfect copy of the trapper's cage key. The painted-silver fox (left) and his next-door cell mate (right) make their escape. Animation by Rudy Larriva. At nine o'clock, the silver foxes escape. The painted fox feigns joy at being set free, but deliberately falls back, re-enters his cage and re- locks the door. Now alone, he notices a tag attached to his cage, reading, \\"This skin reserved for 'Silver Fox Cape for Mrs. Van Dough'\\". He finally understands that what the radio advertisement was promoting was not live fox pets, but rather coats made from their dead pelts. Hearing a grinding noise, he looks through the bars of his cage and sees the trapper sharpening his ax, realizes the true meaning of the silver fox's throat-cutting gesture, and is thrown into a panic. As the trapper heads towards the painted fox's cage, ax in hand, the fox grabs the silver fox's dropped key, unlocks his cage and flees into the woods. Angered, the trapper sends his hunting dogs after him. After a long chase, the painted fox jumps into a lake, makes his way to the other side, and notices the silver paint has washed away. Believing this to be his ticket to safety, he stops the dogs and informs them he is not and never was a silver fox, and therefore it should not be necessary to chase him any longer. The dogs respond, \\"Silver Shmilver... as long as you're a fox!\\" and proceed to beat him up. The flashback ends and the fox ends his story with \\"And that's what's bitin' me. That's what!\\" In a show of support, the crows drop down and finish destroying the radio. Release A video for the short. \\"Fox Pop\\" was released on September 5, 1942. It was later reissued as a Blue Ribbon release on September 28, 1946. It has since been made available to the public domain after years of copyright neglect. Though Fox Pop has yet to make its way onto any official Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies Collection DVDs and Blu-rays, the short was released on The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 4 LaserDisc, released on July 14, 1993.

Seven crewmen died, and Johnson suffered major injury including dislocated hips, broken ankles and a broken arm. Flight Sergeant E.J.

Biography The band was dreamt up when all the members were taking part in one of Marc Riley‚Äôs annual Christmas shows on BBC 6 Music, which involved a large number of local musicians coming into the studio to sing carols live during the show. Frost had already worked with several members of the band on other projects, including during the recording of his second solo album when he travelled to the Earlies studio in Burnley to record a song In a 2012 newspaper interview with the band, Christian Madden was quoted as saying \\"We read a review of Liam's second album and it criticised him for being a ballsy vocalist‚Ä¶And I just thought, I've got to work with that guy.\\" Named after the Tokoloshe; a mischievous sprite which appears in African mythology, the band's moniker was suggested by Christian Madden as an emergency measure but as the band developed their songs many had working titles which include the word Tok and the name began to define the music. TOKOLOSH's music was described in national press as \\"danceable folk with darkly sexual lyrics.\\" and the band explained this by saying \\"All of these songs focus on a slightly different side of adult relationships‚Ä¶The desperate and slightly obsessive aspect maybe, but also how people can change inside of a relationship - for better or worse.\\". On 12 January 2012 TOKOLOSH performed a live session on BBC 6 Music for DJ Marc Riley‚Äôs radio show where he described the band as a supergroup. The band played three tracks; The Hollow, Tok De France and Shapeshifter; the second song of which underwent a minor name change by the time it appeared on the album Stay Strong. The band played a second 6 Music session for Riley on 22 October of the same year where again they played tracks which at the time only had working titles. TokoDiddly later became The Knife Twists whilst Tokvember was released as Unknown Animal. The band also played TokoHorse which retained this title when released as a single by Static Caravan. October 2012 also saw the release of the band's debut single consisting of the tracks The Hollow and TokoHorse. The 7\\" vinyl release was limited to 300 grey wax pressings and was released via the Static Caravan label with artwork from Marc Atkins. Static Caravan released a further 7\\" from the band in January 2013 containing the tracks Shapeshifter and Bloodlines. In August 2014 the band released their debut album Stay Strong on the Jack To Phono label with Louder Than War describing it as \\"a landmark album sweetly accessible and full of surprises\\". Live Performances TOKOLOSH have played sporadic dates in eclectic venues mainly in Manchester. Their debut Manchester show was in the reading room of the historic John Rylands Library on Deansgate and other shows have included a gig in Whitworth Park to mark the temporary closure of the Whitworth Art Gallery as it shut for refurbishment, a support slot for I Am Kloot at the Manchester Apollo on 13 December 2013, an outdoor show in St Anne‚Äôs Square, Manchester as part of the Dig The City urban gardening festival and a woodland gig at Festival No 6 in Portmerion where they played the 'In The Woods' stage. In March 2015 it was announced that the band would play micro-festival Cloudspotting; a festival situated at Gisburn Forest in the Forest of Bowland which TOKOLOSH previous played in 2013. Some of the band's gigs have seen slight line up changes when the musicians have had commitments with their other bands. Sudders bass duties have been covered by guitarist Tom Lloyd Goodwin whilst drummer Bo Walsh has stood in for Richard Young when he was available.

Confucius considered him unintelligent because he was very short and ugly, but he served capably in the governments of the states of Lu and Wey. Life Gao Chai was born in 521 BC, 30 years younger than Confucius. He was a native of the State of Qi, and a member of the noble house of Gao. He was said to be very ugly and dwarfish in stature, not even six chi tall (about ). Confucius considered him unintelligent, but he showed great ability as a governor. Gao Chai served as a city magistrate in the State of Lu, and later accompanied Zilu, another prominent disciple of Confucius, to serve in the government of the neighbouring State of Wey. In 480 BC, Prince Kuaikui plotted a coup d'etat and took over the throne of Wey. Gao urged Zilu to flee from the turmoil, but Zilu, determined to protect his lord Kong Kui, refused and was killed. Gao Chai escaped to safety. When Gao Chai served as a judge in Wey, he once condemned a criminal to the punishment of having his foot cut off. When he was later fleeing the state, the same man saved his life. Confucius praised Gao's ability to administer harsh justice with benevolence, so as to prevent resentment from the people he punished. Honours In Confucian temples, Gao Chai's spirit tablet is placed in the outer court, beyond those of the Four Assessors and Twelve Wise Ones, and next to that of Gongxi Ai. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously awarded Gao Chai the nobility title of Count of Gong (ÂÖ±‰ºØ). During the Song dynasty, Emperor Zhenzong further awarded him the title of Marquis of Gongcheng (ÂÖ±Âüé‰æØ).

It mostly consists of wet, often flooded, meadows interspersed with ditches and canals, and is an important wintering area for water birds. It acts as a buffer zone between the city and the R4 ring road's noise-reducing barriers have been erected to lessen the road's impact on the wildlife. There are three main trails through the reserve and at the centre is the Valkenhuis or Falcon House, a historic building previously used by falconers for the training of birds for the Counts of Flanders. A visitor information centre was built in 2006 at the entrance to the reserve.  Fauna  Willow trees at sunset The reserve is best known for the large numbers of ducks and geese that overwinter here on the flooded grassland. The commonest wildfowl are wigeon, teal and shovelers. Also present are smaller numbers of pintail, gadwall, shelduck, tufted duck and pochard. There are also Canada geese and barnacle geese, neither of which are native species. Other water birds include lapwings, curlews, ruff and snipe. Some of these waterfowl are present in the reserve throughout the year and others are summer visitors. Lapwings, gadwall and black-tailed godwits breed here as do the great crested grebe, the little grebe and the kingfisher, and there is a large colony of cormorants at the west end of the park. Small passerine birds nesting here include the reed warbler, the marsh warbler, the sedge warbler, the reed bunting, the willow tit, the bluethroat, the common grasshopper warbler and the Cetti's warbler. Other nesting species include the hobby hawk, the Eurasian sparrowhawk, the lesser spotted woodpecker, the cuckoo and the tawny owl. Near the water are dragonflies and in the water are many species of aquatic invertebrates. Amphibians present in the park include smooth and Alpine newts, the common toad, the common frog and the green frog. Land mammals include hares and rabbits, and many species of bats, mice and shrews.

It is a record of the kabuki actors Onoe Kikugoro V and Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç IX performing a scene from the kabuki play Momijigari. It is the oldest extant Japanese film and the first film to be designated an Important Cultural Property. Film content The film features the scene in which Taira no Koremori defeats a demon who has disguised itself as Princess Sarashina. Production and exhibition Momijigari was planned primarily as a record of the performance of the two famous actors. Shibata, who worked for the Konishi Photographic Store, shot it using a Gaumont camera. It was filmed in November 1899 in an open space behind the Kabuki-za in Tokyo, with Shibata using three reels of film. It was a windy day, however, and a gust blew away one of Danj≈´r≈ç's fans, a mishap that remained in the film since retakes were not possible. Since the film was meant only as a record, it was not initially shown publicly. Danj≈´r≈ç only saw it himself a year after it was filmed. There was an agreement that it would not be screened for the public until after Danj≈´r≈ç's death, but when he fell ill and could not appear at a performance at the Naka-za in Osaka, it was screened in his place. It ran from 7 July to 1 August 1903, a long run spurred in part by the fact that Kikugor≈ç had recently died. Danj≈´r≈ç himself died in September 1903, and the film showed at the Kabuki-za after that, for one week starting on 9 February 1904. Legacy Barring the discovery of another film, Momijigari is the oldest Japanese-made film for which a print still exists. Kabuki actor Onoe Baiko VI stated on his book Ume No Shita Kaze that a test movie of the dance drama Ninjin Dojo-ji, starring himself and fellow actor Ichimura Kakitsu VI (later Ichimura Uzaemon XV), was shot months before but it probably got lost before 1912. It is also an early example of the kind of \\"kabuki cinema\\" that would become prominent in the first decades of the Japanese film industry, in which films were often records of or attempts to reproduce kabuki theater. According to the film historian Hiroshi Komatsu, it is also an example of how the distinction between fiction and non-fiction cinema was not yet an issue at the time, since the film was both a documentary of a stage performance and a presentation of a fictional story. In 2009, Momijigari became the first film to be designated an Important Cultural Property under Japan's Law for the Protection for Cultural Properties. What has specifically received that designation is a dupe negative 35mm celluloid print of the film that is 352 feet in length, which if projected at 16 frames per second would be 3 minutes and 50 seconds long.

These wooden models represented the work of servants, farmers, other skilled craftsman, armies, and religious rituals.Kathryn A. Bard, Steven Blake Shubert, Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, pp.266f, Routledge, 1999 The different types of models served as symbols and were believed to perform various functions for the deceased.Bard & Shubert 1999, pp.266f. Origin During the Protodynastic and Early Dynastic period (3200‚Äì2686 BC) the funerary sacrifice of servants was practiced to provide for the deceased royal retainers to accompany him into the afterlife.Ian Shaw & Paul Nicholson, The British Museum Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p.134, 1995, British Museum Press At Abydos and Saqqara (3100‚Äì2890 BC), the tombs of 1st-Dynasty rulers suggest this practice with shared-roof subsidiary burials surrounding the tombs.Shaw & Nicholson 1995, p.134 The practice of human sacrifice was later superseded by the wooden model representations of servants instead.Shaw & Nicholson 1995, p.134 Egyptian royalty likely felt a pressing need for servants in the afterlife, having been waited on hand and foot by them during their entire lifetime. This seems to have led to the diverse variety of models found in tombs to perform various functions.\\"Ancient Egypt: Funerary Objects\\", Kibbutz Reshafim, n.p., [cited 9 Dec. 2014]. Online: http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/funerary_practices/funerary_objects.htm Originally royal tombs were provided only one model servant, but as time went on the number of wooden models increased, some containing 365, one for every day of the year.Shaw & Nicholson 1995, p.266 Additional scenery, animals, and objects also began to be provided.Kibbutz Reshafim, n.p. As the practice of wooden models moved into the New Kingdom, numbers continued to increase. More than 700 figurines are said to have populated the tomb of Sety I (1294‚Äì1279 BC).Shaw & Nicholson 1995, p.266 Variety of models As the practice of funerary models increased in popularity, especially during the Middle Kingdom, so did the variety of the models and their functions. In addition to models of servants, models of bakeries, farms, granaries, factories, military, and religious worship complete with workers, tools, weapons, and animals were made. Each model had a different purpose in the belief of the Egyptians and was provided to perform its specific function. Model houses were included to ensure existence in the afterlife. Farmers, artisans, and craftsmen models were said to increase the material wealth of the individual. If the tomb's resident needed to perform a specific task in the afterlife, a wooden model would be included to perform that task for him. Funerary boat models reflected the mythological beliefs of the Egyptians, that they would help to further the deceased's progression in the underworld.Kibbutz Reshafim, n.p. The best known wooden models come from the tomb of the chancellor Meketre, over half of which are funerary boats.The British Museum, \\"Wooden model of a granary with figures\\", The British Museum, n.p., [cited 9 Dec. 2014].

Shabtis, similarly, were funerary models provided in the tombs of Egyptian royalty to spare the tomb owner from labor in the next life. Shabtis were inscribed with chapter 6 of the Book of the Dead providing them with instructions that enabled them to perform their labors. \\"Overseer\\" models were also provided to ensure the shabti performed their labors. Shabtis were composed of wood, clay, wax, stone, bronze, faience, or glass.

History Prototype of the A8V.01.01 Wetlina. Driver cab in the Autosan Wetlina City. This model was first presented in 2007 at the Transexpo Trade Fair as a prototype version named A8V.01.01 Wetlina. The following year the company produced a variety of models, the A8V.01.02 (tourist version) and the A8V.01.03 (intercity version). The prototype version was reduced in length by 475 mm, this was done by shortening of the overhang. In September 2008, during the Seven Public Transport Days in Warsaw, and a month later in the Transexpo in 2008 the company presented a variation of an urban Wetlina City (A8V.02.01). This was the new series which the company Autosan had begun to manufacture as they did with their older series of the Autosan Solina. The first units of the minibus were delivered to a company in Sweden. In the third quarter of 2009 the company started producing models with engines that meet the standard of the Euro 5 qualification. The series is sold on the market in the United Kingdom and Ireland, where the minibuses are known as Autosan Osprey. At the end of 2010, the trade name removed the A8V. From that moment, the minibuses are known as Autosan Wetlina and Autosan Wetlina City. In 2011, the Autosan company has made a prisoner transportation bus in the series. The production of the Autosan Wetlina minibus had been stopped in 2013, which was related to the stop in manufacture of the chassis for the Mercedes-Benz Vario. Specification The minibuses in the A8V series were built on the chassis of the Mercedes-Benz Vario O818D. The body structure is made of steel tubes with square and rectangular cross-sections, which are joined together by welding. The outer structure, is welded to the frame, and is made of corrosion- resistant materials such as stainless steel and plastic. When compared to the previous model the seat next to the driver has been removed, which makes the driver cab very big. With larger dimensions and better built interior layout the minibus can carry more passengers when compared to the Autosan Solina.

Although technically open to all political views, it was dominated by anarchists. The members agreed that the workers should revolt if war were declared, but disagreed on whether soldiers should desert. They were subjected to police surveillance and arrests. By 1908 the association had few remaining members. Background In December 1902 Georges Yvetot was one of the founders of the Ligue antimilitariste, along with fellow anarchists Henri Beylie, Paraf-Javal, Albert Libertad and √âmile Janvion. The Ligue antimilitariste was to become the French section of the Association internationale antimilitariste (AIA). Beylie was secretary-treasurer of the league. In 1903 he published the brochure Le militarisme. Ses causes, ses cons√©quences, les moyens de le combattre. Foundation The founder of the AIA was the Dutch pastor Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis of Amsterdam, a socialist who considered that militarism was created by the capitalist press, politicians and education. The anarchists Charles Malato, Urbain Gohier and Victor M√©ric were founding members of the AIA, also called the Association internationale antimilitariste des travailleurs (AIAT), in 1904. Yvetot and Miguel Almereyda (Eug√®ne Vigo) led the French section and sat on the AIA committee. The AIA was open to workers of all political leanings, including socialists, syndicalists and anarchists. Yvetot wrote in the AIA bulletin, \\"There is no need that is more urgent than antimilitarist propaganda. ... This is why, outside of political groups, outside even of economic groups, the AIA truly has its raison d'√™tre.\\" History On 26-28 June 1904 the AIA held its founding congress in Amsterdam, with a 12-member delegation from France. L'Ennemi du Peuple reported that there were 4,500 attendees at the last public meeting, but this is probably an exaggeration. The congress was dominated by anarchists, but also included syndicalists and communists. The question of whether refusal of military service should be AIA strategy was hotly debated. Libertad and Paraf- Javal considered the simple call for desertion as too timid, and refused to participate further. Although technically not linked to the Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail, (CGT), the AIA moved its headquarters into the CGT building and had many of the same members. The AIA was the subject of intense police surveillance. The AIA held a national congress in Saint-√âtienne on 14-16 July 1905, attended by delegates from across France. It was agreed that the AIA was committed to a workers' revolution in the event of war, but that it was neutral on the subject of desertion. After publishing a poster aimed at conscripts, twenty eight members of the AIA were tried on 26‚Äì30 December 1905. Twenty six received harsh sentences, including Gustave Herv√© with four years in prison and Miguel Almereyda with three years. Eventually they were pardoned on 14 July 1906. The second AIA congress was held in Amsterdam on 30‚Äì31 August 1907. However, by 1907 the organization was in terminal decline in France, with only small groups remaining in the main cities. In September 1907 Le Libertaire called for formation of a new French antimilitarist federation. At a meeting in Paris in October 1907 the secretary-treasurer for greater Paris was expelled for extorting subscription fees, and for rumors that he was being paid by the police. The AIA tried to revive itself in March 1908 under the leadership of Georges Durupt and Gaston Delpech, but was unable to obtain an adequate base of support.

Her One Night Stand suite (1977-9) anticipated the conceptual and narrative concerns, formal rigor and emotional depth of her mature work. Shot in the flat, unaffected tones and color of the day's minimalist and non-theatrical aesthetic, these playfully sparse compositions offered fragmented clues intimating a sexual tryst: Polaroid snapshots of people disrobing tucked behind phone cords and alarm clocks, rumpled sheets, nightstands. Absence was a key theme, with the Polaroids and nightstands‚Äîboth humble holders of mundane personal effects and silent witnesses to life's most intimate moments‚Äîstanding in for protagonists.

Shot in Cowin's home and cast with herself and family members including her twin sister, these tableaux evoked familial intimacy and tension (marital, parental, sibling and professional), as well as a sense of artifice that subtly undermined the illusion of spontaneous documentary. In several works, Cowin used doubling devices‚Äîblack-and-white background images and her twin‚Äîto suggest memory, history, a ghostly or other self, and the challenges of female identity from multiple vantage points. The series' images function as stand-alone multi- layered works, and collectively, as commentary on contemporary American family life, the web of social construction, and the media's blurring of public and the private, which can distort personal moments into pathologically self- conscious \\"performances.\\" Eileen Cowin, I‚Äôll Give You Something to Cry About, Photographic installation, 96\\" x 120\\", 1998. In the latter 1980s, Cowin shifted toward more broadly resonant, sparsely staged images that The New York Times compared to the stylized theater work of Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars. Working with models and archetypal, symbolic gestures emerging from inky, black backgrounds, she drew, alternately, on the language of film noir (men in trench coats, women in slinky red dresses, billowing curtains, shadowed backgrounds) and Renaissance tableau vivant paintings.Muchnic, Suzanne. \\"From the Street to the Studio,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 1, 1982.

It was written in the fall of 1241 at D≈çgen's monastery K≈çsh≈çh≈çrin-ji in Kyoto. As the title implies, the work is a discussion of the concept of buddha nature, laying out D≈çgen's unique viewpoint on what the term means. While more typical interpretations see Buddha-nature as the inherent prospect of becoming a buddha, or alternatively a sort of life force within us, in Bussh≈ç D≈çgen interprets Buddha-nature simply as concrete reality itself. He presents this thesis in his characteristically difficult style using frequent allusions to and comments on classical Zen literature, as well as complex word play hinging on creative interpretations of Classical Chinese sentence structure. Interpretations of buddha nature The literature of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism includes many discussions and comments on the notion of buddha nature, and its exact meaning has been interpreted in numerous ways over many centuries. At is most basic, it can simply be synonymous with \\"buddha\\" or the qualities that make one a Buddha. More commonly, it is used to mean the potential to become a buddha, with common analogies likening buddha nature to a seed and a fully-fledged buddha to the mature plant. Finally, it may mean the absolute, fundamental nature of all things. D≈çgen begins his work by quoting the putative words of Shakyamuni Buddha as recorded in the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra stating that all living beings have buddha nature. He then equates this statement to a dialogue D≈çgen often cites between Nanyue Huairang and his teacher Dajian Huineng in which they discuss the undefiled nature of \\"practice and verification\\" (), setting up his argument that buddha nature is just reality itself.

He was more inclined to art, however, and had his first lessons at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he studied with Carlos de Haes. His ample income allowed him to devote himself entirely to painting.

Hoar Jr., \\"Gald√≥s y Aureliano de Beruete, visi√≥n renovada de Orbajosa\\" @ Memoria Digital de Canarias. Later, he made a trip to Paris, where he was introduced to plein-air painting by Mart√≠n Rico. For many years, he was a Professor at the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza (which he helped to create) and is often associated with the Generation of '98 or its political movement, Regenerationism. He also supported scientific conferences and excursions, which included a crossing of the Sierra de Guadarrama that he participated in and used as inspiration for many of his works. Throughout his life, he remained an avid traveller and enthusiastic exhibitor. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1900. During the last years of his life, he wrote several brief treatises on painting and painters, including one of the first monographs on Diego Vel√°zquez, which was published in Paris in 1898. In fact, he numbered most of the great Spanish artists of the day among his friends. After his death in 1912 in Madrid, Joaqu√≠n Sorolla organized the first retrospective of Beruete's works, held at Sorolla's mansion.

It was the first cereal-themed caf√© in the United Kingdom. It announced its closure on 8 July 2020 as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. Development Identical twins Alan and Gary Keery, from Belfast, came up with the idea of selling breakfast cereal after experiencing a morning hangover during a lunch break in Shoreditch and craving a \\"sugary cereal fix\\". The brothers were initially dissuaded from pursuing the project but continued after conducting their own market research. Inspired by established cereal cafes in the United States and the premise of the 2007 film Flakes, they went about asking consumers on the streets whether or not they would buy into the concept. They discovered that more than half of the people they had asked would consider visiting their cafe. Funding for the proposal came from a business loan following an unsuccessful ¬£60,000 crowdfunding attempt on Indiegogo. They claimed they found it difficult to rent a location based on their business venture but eventually settled on an old video store. Business The interior of the Brick Lane branch The two-storey caf√© is situated on Brick Lane, near Shoreditch, and employs eight staff. The interior is designed to reflect a retro style with exposed brickwork, formica furniture and 1980s and '90s music. Among the decor are novelty cereal boxes, vintage milk bottles and other cereal related memorabilia. The cafe offers more than 100 different varieties of global cereal brands, 12 kinds of milk and 20 toppings. It also sells coffee, toast and poptarts. In 2014 the brothers were challenged by Channel 4 over the price of their bowls of cereal in Tower Hamlets. After being told the London borough had some of the highest rates of poverty in the country, Gary denied this was the case and said his cereal was \\"cheap for the area\\" before refusing to continue with the interview. Media commentary ranged from praise of their entrepreneurship from Boris Johnson to criticism pointing at gentrification around Shoreditch. In response, the brothers wrote an open letter to the broadcaster on Facebook, claiming the reporter \\"didn‚Äôt even pay me for the cereal, which you could so easily afford with your overpriced River Island suit‚Äù.

Passenger trolley service operated through the terminal from 1908 until 1948 when trolley service over the Williamsburg Bridge ended. The station was constructed with balloon loops for turning around streetcars after they crossed over the Williamsburg Bridge to send them back to Brooklyn. In 2011 a proposal was made to turn the Williamsburg Bridge Trolley Terminal into the Lowline park.Foderaro, Lisa W. \\"Inspired by High Line, Park Is Envisioned With Sights Set Low\\", The New York Times, November 21, 2011. Accessed November 21, 2011.Plans for Delancey Underground presented to Community Board 3 Layout A plan of the underground trolley terminal and the adjacent Essex Street subway station. =Underground terminal= The trolley terminal is located under the south side of Delancey Street between Clinton Street to the east and Norfolk Street to the west, one block east of Essex Street. The terminal is adjacent to the Brooklyn-bound subway track of the Essex Street subway station. The terminal consisted of eight balloon loops which fed directly into and out of the trolley tracks on the south side of the Williamsburg Bridge, allowing trolleys running over the bridge to reverse direction and return to Brooklyn. The loops were numbered 1 through 8 from west to east. Each loop was assigned to at most two streetcar services. In between the loops were seven low-level island platforms, slightly raised from track level. Each platform had 12 foot-wide staircases leading to the street. Each loop could hold two trolley cars, with a trolley stopping at the west end of the platform to discharge Manhattan-bound passengers, then moving up to the east end to pick up Brooklyn-bound passengers. The terminal was designed with both electrical incandescent lighting and vaults that allowed natural light to enter the station. Below are the list of routes that served each loop: *Loop 1: Nostrand Avenue Line, Belt Line *Loop 2: Broadway Line, Reid Avenue Line *Loop 3: Wilson Avenue Line *Loop 4: Ralph Avenue Line *Loop 5: Bushwick Avenue Line *Loop 6: Sumner Avenue Line, Tompkins Avenue Line *Loop 7: Williamsburg Bridge Local *Loop 8: Grand Street Line, Franklin Avenue Line =Surface terminal= At ground-level was an additional terminal for through- trolley service from the New York Railways Company and Third Avenue Railway, whose lines traveled from Manhattan along the north side of the bridge to the Washington Plaza trolley terminal in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The covered exit stairs from the subway and underground terminal led directly to the shelters serving the Manhattan surface trolleys. Both the staircases and shelters were designed with terracotta features. The exit stairs were designed as kiosks constructed of concrete, and finished with blue and white tiling. =Transfers= Brooklyn trolley lines which crossed the Williamsburg Bridge and terminated at the terminal included the Belt Line, Broadway Line, Bushwick Avenue Line, Franklin Avenue Line, Grand Street Line, Marcy Avenue Line, Nostrand Avenue Line, Ralph Avenue Line, Sumner Avenue Line, Reid Avenue Line, Tompkins Avenue Line, and Wilson Avenue Line (also called the Hamburg Avenue Line). Several of these lines, including the Franklin, Nostrand, Tompkins, and Reid Lines, traveled via the Culver surface line to the Culver Depot in Coney Island. The Marcy Avenue line traveled to a racetrack in Sheepshead Bay. The Wilson Avenue Line traveled to the resorts in Canarsie. The Grand Street Line, meanwhile, traveled via the Junction Boulevard Line to the North Beach amusement area in northern Queens, now the site of LaGuardia Airport. History Williamsburg Bridge and Delancey Street, 1919. Kiosks in center go down to underground trolley terminal; larger one to left goes to subway. Foreground: waiting areas for Manhattan streetcars The Williamsburg Bridge opened on December 19, 1903. In March 1904, it was determined that Brooklyn streetcars operated by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) would cross the bridge and terminate at Delancey Street, while the Manhattan trolleys of the New York Railways Company would terminate at Washington Plaza in Williamsburg. On November 6, 1904, BRT streetcars including the Reid Avenue Line began crossing the bridge to Lower Manhattan. In 1905, it was decided to build a permanent underground terminal for Brooklyn surface cars and future elevated cars coming from the BRT's Broadway elevated; this station would eventually become the first stop of the BMT Nassau Street Line. The Essex Street trolley terminal was constructed along with the adjoining subway station, but was delayed due to changes in the plans for the subway station. Both stations were constructed using cut-and-cover methods, by excavating Delancey Street. In addition, the approaches of the subway tracks and the southern bridge trolley tracks were lowered into ramps leading to the terminal. As a temporary solution until the terminal was completed, trolleys terminated at stub-end tracks on the street. This setup, however, was inefficient and led to passenger congestion. The underground trolley terminal opened on May 19, 1908, with New York City mayor George B. McClellan Jr. operating the first streetcar over the bridge into the terminal. The new terminal allowed the BRT to double the capacity of its streetcar operations over the bridge. On December 1, 1923, service on the now-Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) lines over the Williamsburg Bridge ended, due to decreasing profits and a dispute with the city over tolls. BMT service was truncated to Washington Plaza in Williamsburg, and bridge service was replaced with municipal shuttle service. On February 15, 1931, BMT streetcars once again began running to Manhattan after municipal shuttle service ended. Only the Nostrand, Ralph, Reid, and Tompkins lines resumed traveling over the bridge, while the remaining lines continued to terminate in Brooklyn. On December 6, 1948, the last of the streetcar lines to run over the bridge, the \\"Williamsburg Bridge Local\\" shuttle between the Manhattan and Brooklyn trolley terminals, was converted into the bus route. Afterwards, the Essex Street terminal was closed, and the kiosks to the terminal and subway station were removed from Delancey Street.

A0808MN Sancity and which are designed for urban and suburban public transportation services. History of the bus model =Prototype= In 2000, the International Trade Fair presented the prototype Autosan A613MN Mini, which was built based on the chassis of the Csepel 613.04. It was the first low-entry bus built by the Autosan company. The bus was equipped with a door 1-2-0 system. The bus had a 4-cylinder Cummins B 135-20 engine which meets Euro 2 standards with a capacity of 5.9 dm and maximum power of 100 kW (136 hp), with a 6-speed ZF 6S-36 manual transmission. It had a length of 7850 mm, width 2400 mm and a height of 2630 mm. The structure was supported by steel pipes with a cross-section joined together by welding. The roof and side walls were made of aluminium and the front and rear walls were made from plastic. Four prototypes were made of such buses, which were delivered to Bydgoszcz. The bus gained many potential buyers, but trouble's with the Csepel company which provided the chassis meant that Autosan had to find a different company which had built chassis. There was considered cooperation with the Turkish company BMC, but ultimately the company decided to develop their own Autosan chassis for this bus. After the company Polskie Autobusy was founded, there was development and increased sales of the buses with Autosan and Jelcz brands, in 2002 it was decided to increase the quantity of production. In the main they were built for city public transportation purposes, although some were built for urban and local use making the H7 series, which were transferred to Jelcz. Due to financial difficulties of the Jelcz company, the prototype bus Jelcz M083C Libero had begun being built in 2006. In 2007 the company presented the final model of the bus, and in 2008 the company started its production. The bus was based on the chassis of the bus Autosan Gemini A0808T and was produced in Sanok. =Specification of the serial model= Autosan A0808MN Sancity the rear of the bus. In October 2008, with the announcement of bankruptcy of Jelcz, Autosan took over (as owner of the rights to the design of the Polskie Autobusy). This bus is now called Autosan A0808MN Sancity and was presented at the Transexpo Trade Fair in Kielce in 2008. In Sanok in 2008, the company built one copy of the bus, which did not have any major stylist differences in between the Jelcz M083C. The bus became popular in Sweden. The serial production of the model Sancity Autosan A0808MN was launched in late 2008. The chassis has a long frame, which is integral with the structure. The body structure is built from stainless steel pipes joined together by welding. The outer structure has stainless steel panels and plastic on the front and the back, welded to the frame of the bus. The rear side flaps are made of aluminium. The bus has a possibility of including air conditioning and monitoring of the passenger compartment. The front LAF axle has been linked by two pneumatic bellows, four shock absorbers and two stabiliser heels. The rear axle built by the Meritor company is linked on four pneumatic bellows, four shock absorbers with a stabiliser heel.

Origin Firuz Bey belonged to the Mihaloƒülu family, a noted akinji family that was instrumental in the conquest of the Balkans. Career = Bosnia = From 1495 to 1496, Firuz was sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Bosnia. His predecessor Jahja Pasha built a mosque in Sarajevo during his reign in Bosnia (1494‚Äì95) but did not provide a water supply to it. According to a legend, he asked his successor, Firuz Bey to do so from Sedrenik to the Jahja Pasha mosque. Firuz Bey did so and also built a public tap in honour of his predecessor. = Scutari = Firuz Bey held the position of Sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Scutari from 1496 to 1502. ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá who controlled the neighboring Principality of Zeta maintained frequent correspondence with other Christian feudal states with the intention of establishing an anti-Ottoman coalition. When his brother Stefan betrayed him to the Ottomans in 1496, ƒêuraƒë proposed to accept the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire and Firuz Bey if they allowed him to remain as governor in Zeta. Firuz Bey refused this proposal and invited ƒêuraƒë to either come to Scutari to clarify his anti-Ottoman activities or to flee Zeta. When Firuz Bey attacked Zeta with strong forces in 1496 ƒêuraƒë was forced to flee to Venice. In 1497, Firuz Bey captured Grbalj and put Zeta under his effective military control, although it was still part of the Zeta governed by Stefan Crnojeviƒá. In 1499, Firuz Bey formally annexed Zeta to the territory of Sanjak of Scutari, after he became suspicious of Stefan because of his connections with Venice. Firuz Bey invited Stefan Crnojeviƒá to Skadar where he imprisoned him. It is thought that Stefan probably died in prison since he was never mentioned again in historical sources. In 1499, Firuz Bey organized raids of the territory around Durazzo. It was poorly defended and its population would have surrendered if Firuz Bey had brought more forces. During the same year Firuz Bey joined Isa Pasha and raided the inland of Dalmatia. In 1501, Firuz Bey captured Durazzo. After the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1499‚Äì1503), Firuz Bey became the Ottoman representative for the region of Cattaro. = Bosnia = After the death of Skender Pasha in November 1504, Firuz Bey became Sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Bosnia again. The first mention of the name of the city Sarajevo was in a 1507 letter written by Firuz Bey. In 1509, he built a hammam () in Sarajevo and several shops around it as its vakif. He also built a maktab (elementary school) and madrasa before 1515. This was the oldest madrasa in Sarajevo and one of the oldest in Bosnia. In 1528, the neighborhood of this madrasa developed into a mahala named Mahala of Firuz Beg's Madrasa (). Legacy Until 1945, one street in Sarajevo was named after Firuz Bey. After Bosnia and Herzegovina seceded from Yugoslavia in 1992, one street is again named after Firuz Bey.List of streets of Sarajevo on Sarajevo.ba portal (Glasinaƒçka # Firuz-begova) His madrasa was destroyed at the end of the 17th century by the army of Eugene of Savoy. His hammam was operational until 1810 when it was closed because of the poor state of its roof. The building slowly deteriorated and was almost completely destroyed right before the First World War. The site and remains of this hammam are defined as a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 2008. Annotations He is known as \\"Firuz Bey\\" () and \\"Feriz Bey\\" (). In Serbo-Croatian he is also called Firuz Mihajloviƒá.

He began his senior career with Walsall, but never played for their first team. He also played in the Irish Premier League for Glenavon and for a number of non-league clubs, mainly in his native north- east of England. A midfielder in the early part of his career, he has also played as a forward. Football career Jameson was born in Middlesbrough, and as a youngster played for Whinney Banks in the Teesside League. He joined Football League First Division club Walsall in the 2003 close season, and signed a professional contract a year later. He was twice named as a substitute for Walsall's first team, once when manager Paul Merson fielded a team of reserves in a League Cup match, and once for a league match against Blackpool, but was not used. He went on loan to Southern League club Bromsgrove Rovers in February 2005, but was reported to be homesick and his contract was ended by mutual consent in March. He returned to the north-east where he played twice for Northern League club Durham City, before earning himself a monthly contract with League Two club Darlington, to give them further depth in midfield. He made his debut as a last-minute substitute as Darlington were eliminated from the League Cup by local rivals Hartlepool United, and his first Football League appearance, again off the bench, in the next match, a 4‚Äì4 draw away at Chester City. He made four more substitute appearances before his first start, which was on 22 October as Darlington beat Cheltenham Town 3‚Äì1. Within days, he had broken a metatarsal bone and was expected to be out for several weeks, and he was released in January. Jameson then played in the Northern League for Dunston and Billingham Town, before joining Irish League club Glenavon in January 2008. He returned to the Northern League in August 2008 with Billingham Synthonia, where he spent five seasons, then had short spells with Consett, Shildon and Guisborough Town, before returning to Billingham Synthonia in September 2014.

Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management. Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used. In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management. Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations. Classification mapping is usually now done using geographic information systems (GIS) software.  Classification schemes  Following, some important classification schemes. =K√∂ppen (1884)= Although this scheme is in fact of a climate classification, it has a deep relationship with vegetation studies: * Class A ** Tropical rainforest (Af) ** Tropical monsoon (Am) ** Tropical savanna (Aw, As) * Class B ** Desert (BWh, BWk) ** Semi-arid (BSh, BSk) * Class C ** Humid subtropical (Cfa, Cwa) ** Oceanic (Cfb, Cwb, Cfc, Cwc) ** Mediterranean (Csa, Csb, Csc) * Class D ** Humid continental (Dfa, Dwa, Dfb, Dwb, Dsa, Dsb) ** Subarctic (Dfc, Dwc, Dfd, Dwd, Dsc, Dsd) * Class E ** Tundra (ET) ** Ice cap (EF) ** Alpine (ET, EF) =Wagner & von Sydow (1888)= Wagner & von Sydow (1888) scheme: Vegetationsg√ºrtel (vegetation belts):Wagner, H. & von Sydow, E. 1888.

Another boy is selected to collect the stick during which time all the boys run up the tree. The boy who has collected the stick places it in the circle. The other boys try to get the stick before being caught by the boy who placed it there. If the boy who placed the stick tags another player before anyone picks up the stick, the boy who has been tagged is the one who has to stay on the ground and try to tag another player. If a player picks up the stick before the original player on the ground who collected the stick tags another, the game ends and a new game start but the original player has to tag another player. =Bandar keela ()= This Game Start was Since 1902 5 October Boys play this game in winter by digging a pole into the ground and attaching a four-foot rope.

The player that catches it will then be carried by the key player to enable key player to kick the ball into the hole. If he does, the two players switch and the key player will be carried enabling the other player to kick the ball. If the player kicks the ball into another player's hole, then the two will switch sides. This is repeated for all the players.

Outside the grid, another box is drawn on the northern edge, in the center which represents the store called sandook (). The key player is selected to mind the salt in the center square. The other players try to get the salt and run along the pathways to go to the other side of the store. The key player's aim is to tag the other players. To start the game, one player will touch the key player's hand and then run away to avoid being tagged. If the other players step into the 4 boxes in the grid, they will be killed and declared \\"madeen\\" (). The key player cannot go backwards on the track, until he reaches the end of the box, whilst remaining on the track. He cannot step into any box in the grid. Players who take the salt and run across the store area are declared \\"nar\\" () The players who get tagged become \\"madeen\\". The key player will become \\"nar\\" after tagging another player. Otherwise, he will be \\"madeen\\". Once all players become either\\"nar\\" or \\"madeen\\", the game ends. At this point, the players who have crossed the store area and have become \\"nar\\" will stand in a line. About 25 metres away, the \\"madeen\\" group will stand in a line. The \\"nar\\" players will ask the \\"madeen\\" players: \\"bil bachya di maa, roti pakki ai ki na?\\" (translation: bill's mother, are the chapattis made?) (). If the \\"madeen\\" group say no, the \\"nar\\" group will ask the question again until the \\"madeen\\" group say, yes. At this point, all the players run to tag each other. The \\"madeen\\" players who get tagged by the \\"nar\\" players, will need to carry them to the centre square. The game then starts again but this time, the key player will be the player who became \\"madeen\\" first. =Tipri= Tipri is a dance cum team sport played on the festive occasion of Vamana Dwadashi on the streets, predominantly in the current city of Patiala but also Ambala.

If the ball does not hit the stones and is caught by any of the opposite team member after a single bounce, the captain is marked out of the game and have to sit outside the field and wait till his team has finished their turn. This way each member has a turn from the striker team and if is marked out has to sit outside the field, till all members are out, then the opposite team gets to be the striker team. ** When the ball hits the stone tower, the stones scatter on the ground and everybody can be seen running around the field. At this time the striker team members try to fix the stone tower back without getting hit by the ball. The job of the fielder team is to hit the ball to as many members of the striker team before the striker team members can build the stone tower back up. ** This chaos ends if members of striker team are unable to build the stone tower back up and get hit by the ball or they successfully build the tower. If the tower is built back, the striker team can accumulate points or can also call any one member of their team from outside of the field is any one was sent out. Once all the members of the striker team are out, then the opposite team gets a chance to be the striker and the game starts again.

She became a woman's health care advocate and spread her message through lectures, clinics, and her writings. Mary Gove Nichols raised children, treated patients, published writings, and sought to live what she believed.\\"Shameless.\\" Google Books. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Dec. 2014. Nichols first marriage was to Hiram Gove, an unsuccessful businessman. Gove married Nichols expecting financial support and obedience from his wife. Nichols moved to Lynn, Massachusetts with her husband and child. In Massachusetts, Nichols ran a girls' school, and this was where she began her health reform career. In 1841, she took her daughter and moved back with her parents leaving her husband behind; he eventually agreed to a divorce in 1847 or 1848. After being abused, both sexually and emotionally, she made it her life's work to inform women of their bodies and their opportunities. In July 1848, she remarried to Thomas Low Nichols, a writer who also had an interest in health reform and progressive views on women's rights. Together they planned to open a School of Health, School of Progress and School of Life in a three-story building they leased. They moved to England at the outset of the Civil War. Nichols wrote novels and stories under the pseudonym Mary Orme.Ogilvie, Marilyn Bailey; Harvey, Joy Dorothy. (2000). The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: L-Z, Volume 2. Routledge. p. 941. She wrote short stories for Godey's Lady's Book. Edgar Allan Poe praised her fiction.Myerson, Joel. (1986). Mary Gove Nichols' Mary Lyndon: A Forgotten Reform Novel.

Natural hygiene and free love advocacy Nichols studied the writings of Sylvester Graham and became a vegetarian around 1837. She was an influential proponent in the natural hygiene movement. She lectured to all-female audiences on anatomy, physiology, and hygiene to relieve women of what she saw as unnecessary physical and mental suffering. She recommended that women exercise daily, breathe fresh air, shower with cold water, avoid the fashionable tight-laced corsets of the day, and abstain from coffee and meat. Nichols lectured for the Ladies Physiological Society, an offshoot of the American Physiological Society. She has been described as the \\"first woman in America to lecture on topics of anatomy and physiology and she included lessons on vegetarianism, and prevention and cure of sickness.\\" Nichols believed that cancer could be cured by a vegetarian diet. In 1851, Nichols and her husband Thomas Low Nichols founded a \\"water-cure\\" clinic, the American Hydropathic Institute in New York City.Weiss, Harry Bischoff; Kemble, Howard R. (1967).

History Venice for centuries wanted to control Cyprus and Venetian merchants worked on the island beginning in 1000 AD, when the Venetian (commercial and military) expansion in the eastern Mediterranean had started. In 1468, James II of Cyprus of the house of Lusignan became King of Cyprus. In 1468, he chose Catherine Cornaro (born in Venice from the noble family of the \\"Corner\\") as his wife and Queen consort of Cyprus. The King's choice was extremely pleasing to the Republic of Venice, as it could henceforth secure the commercial rights and other privileges of Venice in Cyprus. They married in Venice on 30 July 1468 by proxy when she was 14 years old. Venetian Caterina Cornaro, the last medieval \\"Queen of Cyprus\\", by Titian James died soon after the wedding due to a sudden illness and, according to his will, Caterina, who at the time was pregnant, acted as regent. She became monarch when their infant son James died of malaria in August 1474 before his first birthday. The Kingdom of Cyprus had long since declined, and had been a tributary state of the Egyptian Mamluks since 1426. Under Caterina, who ruled Cyprus from 1474 to 1489, the island was controlled by Venetian merchants, and on 14 March 1489 she was forced to abdicate and sell the administration of the country to the Republic of Venice. According to George Boustronios, \\"On 14 February, the Queen dressed in black and accompanied by the Barons and their ladies, set off on horseback. Six knights held her horse's reins. From the moment she left Nicosia, her eyes kept streaming with tears. Upon her departure, the whole population was bewailing.\\" So, the last Crusader state became a colony of Venice, and as compensation, Catherine was allowed to retain the title of Queen and was made the Sovereign Lady of Asolo, a county in the Venetian terraferma in northern Italy, in 1489. The bulk of Venetian Cyprus was composed of Greek Orthodox peasants who were oppressed by the Latin ruling class (related to the former Lusignan kings), and it was estimated that there were some fifty thousand serfs. Venice favored Catholicism, which thus enjoyed a huge increase in followers: there were some problems because of this with the local Greek Orthodox priests. =Attacks by the Ottoman Empire= Map of Nicosia in Cyprus, created by the Venetian cartographer Giacomo Franco, showing the Venetian walls of Nicosia that were built by the Venetians to defend the city in case of an Ottoman attack Throughout the period of Venetian rule, Ottoman Turks raided and attacked the peoples of Cyprus at will. The Greek population of Cyprus were given weapons by their Venetian rulers and fought the attacking Ottomans. In 1489, the first year of Venetian control, Turks attacked the Karpass Peninsula, pillaging and taking captives to be sold into slavery.Library of Congress In 1539 the Turkish fleet attacked and destroyed Limassol. Fearing the ever-expanding Ottoman Empire, the Venetians had fortified Famagusta, Nicosia, and Kyrenia, but most other cities were easy prey. In 1489, when Cyprus came under Venetian rule, Nicosia became their administrative center. The Venetian governors saw it as a necessity for all the cities of Cyprus to be fortified due to the Ottoman threat. In 1567 Venetians built the new fortifications of Nicosia, which are well-preserved until today, demolishing the old walls built by the Franks as well as other important buildings of the Frankish era including the King's Palace, other private palaces and churches and monasteries of both Orthodox and Latin Christians. The new walls took the shape of a star with eleven bastions: the design of the bastion was more suitable for artillery and a better control for the defenders. The walls had three gates: the \\"Kyrenia Gate\\" to the north, the \\"Paphos Gate\\" to the west, and the \\"Famagusta Gate\\" to the east. The river Pedieos flowed through the Venetian walled city, but in 1567 it was diverted outside into the newly built moat for strategic reasons, due to the expected Ottoman attack. The Venetians even modified Kyrenia Castle to meet the threat that the use of gunpowder and cannons posed. The castle's royal quarters and three of its four thin and elegant Frankish towers were demolished and replaced by thickset circular towers that could better withstand cannon fire. Indeed, commercial activity under the Republic of Venice turned Famagusta into a place where merchants and ship owners led lives of luxury. The belief that people's wealth could be measured by the churches they built inspired these merchants to have churches built in varying styles. These churches, which still exist, were the reason Famagusta came to be known as \\"the district of churches\\". The development of the town focused on the social lives of the wealthy people and was centered upon the \\"Lusignan palace\\", the Cathedral, the Square and the harbour. In the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again, but this time with a full-scale invasion rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha landed unopposed near Limassol on July 2, 1570, and laid siege to Nicosia. The city fell on September 9, 1570; 20,000 Nicosians were put to death, and every church, public building, and palace was looted. Only women and boys who were captured to be sold as slaves were spared.Turnbull, Stephen (2003). The Ottoman Empire 1326‚Äì1699 (Essential Histories Series #62). Osprey Publishing. p. 58Hopkins, T. C. F. (2007). Confrontation at Lepanto: Christendom vs. Islam. Macmillan p.82 Word of the massacre spread, and a few days later Mustafa took Kyrenia without having to fire a shot. The Venetian walls of Nicosia were incomplete and not useful in stopping this powerful Ottoman army, which was reinforced in the last months of 1570. However, Famagusta, strengthened by Cyprus' governor Astorre Baglioni,Astorre Baglioni biography (in Italian) resisted with the Siege of Famagusta and put up a strong defense that lasted from September 1570 until August 1571. On 15 September 1570, the Turkish cavalry appeared before the last Venetian stronghold in Cyprus, Famagusta. At this point already, overall Venetian losses (including the local population) were estimated by contemporaries at 56,000 killed or taken prisoner.Setton (1984), p. 990 The Venetian defenders of Famagusta numbered about 8,500 men with 90 artillery pieces and were commanded by Marco Antonio Bragadin. They held out for 11 months against a force that came to number more than 200,000 men, with 145 guns,Turnbull (2003), pp. 58‚Äì59 providing the time needed by the Pope to cobble together an anti-Ottoman league from the reluctant Christian European states.Hopkins (2007), pp. 87‚Äì89 The Turks lost some 52,000 men in five major assaults in early 1571, until in summer the Venetians, despairing to receive any rescue from the homeland and on request from the local starving civilians, decided to surrender. In July 1571 the Turks eventually breached the fortifications of Famagusta and their forces broke into the citadel, being repulsed only at the cost of heavy losses. With provisions and ammunition running out, his soldiers able to fight reduced to just seven hundred and no sign of relief from Venice, on August 1Madden. Page 330. Bragadin asked for terms of surrender. The Turkish commander, Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha, agreed to allow the survivors to safely return to Crete, but he did not keep his word: he was enraged because of his older son's death attacking so few Venetian defenders. There followed a massacre of all Christians still in the city, with Bragadin himself most brutally abused. From a military point of view, the besieged garrison's perseverance required a massive effort by the Ottoman Turks, who were so heavily committed that they were unable to redeploy in time when the Holy League built up the fleet later victorious against the Muslim power at the Battle of Lepanto (1571): this was the legacy of Bragadin and his Venetians to Christianity, as Theodore Mommsen wrote. Historians to this day debate just why Venice did not send help to Bragadin from Souda, Crete. It is alleged that some Venetians thought about putting their limited military assets to better use in the forthcoming clash, already in sight, which would climax in the Battle of Lepanto. The fall of Famagusta marked the beginning of the Ottoman period in Cyprus. It is noteworthy to pinpoint that this is the historical setting to Shakespeare's Othello, the play's title character being the commander of the Venetian garrison defending Cyprus against the Ottomans.

Based at Bardufoss Air Station, the squadron operates eight NHIndustries NH90. The helicopters are used by the Norwegian Coast Guard and serve on the Nordkapp-class, the Barentshav-class and on NoCGV Svalbard. The unit was created on 1 May 1950 to operate de Havilland Vampire Mk. 52 fighter- bombers. The squadron was stationed at Gardermoen Air Station, although from 1952 a detachment was allocated to Bardufoss. From April 1953, 337 was based at V√¶rnes Air Station. The Vampires were retired in 1954 and 337 was made a storage unit. It was reactivated as an operational unit on 1 September 1955, returning to Gardermoen. It then operated the North American F-86K Sabre. This role lasted 1 September 1963, when the squadron was deactivated. The squadron was reactivated on 1 January 1980 and based at Bardufoss. Its new role was to operate six Westland Lynx helicopters for the newly created Coast Guard. The NH90 replacements were ordered in 2001, but delays caused the Lynxes to remain in service until 2014. History =Vampire= Heritage Norwegian Vampires During the build-up of the RNoAF, a central part was the establishment of a fleet of jet aircraft. After rejecting the Gloster Meteor, the air force opted for the de Havilland Vampire. The first order was made on 26 January 1948. All in all Norway bought 62 Vampires, consisting of 20 Mk 3 fighter jets, 36 Mk 52 fighter-bombers and 6 Mk 55 trainers.Duvsete: 53 The first Vampires were delivered on 29 April 1948, constituting the start of the delivery of the Mk 3 and Mk 55s. These entered service with the 336 Squadron based at Gardermoen Air Station.Duvsete: 61 With the delivery of the Mk 52 Vampires from 1950, the quantity exceeded that of which the 336 Squadron could operate. This also involved a split in roles. The existing Mk 3 Vampires would remain with the 336 Squadron and be used for interception and air defence; the new Mk 52s and the 337 Squadron were given the task of bombing ground targets. Both would be based at Gardermoen Air Station.Duvsete: 63 By early 1950 the number of Vampires in the 336 Squadron was sufficiently large that they allowed some Vampires to be transferred to the new squadron. The 337 Squadron was therefore established on 22 May 1950. It was largely made up of newly trained soldiers and was to begin with characterized with a lack of experience in management and operations. Within a year it had twelve aircraft. Training was conducted at the Marka field outside Lista Air Station. Aircraft were flown home from the United Kingdom via RAF G√ºtersloh in West Germany. This base was also regularly used for international training. The 337 Squadron also participated in an international exercise at RAF North Weald. One aircraft crashed after a mid-air collision over Enebakk in 1950. Three aircraft were written off and one pilot killed in late 1951 at or near Gardermoen. Two aircraft collided over Nesodden the following year. The squadron received two Vampire trainers in late 1952.Arheim: 143 The 337 Squadron gradually received more missions in Northern Norway. With the delivery of new Republic F-84 Thunderjets to the 336 Squadron, the remaining Mk 3 Vampires were transferred to the 337 Squadron in 1952. From 1 November the squadron was given responsibility for air defence in Northern Norway. A detachment was stationed Bardufoss Air Station. It had at any given time about six to eight Vampires. The detachment suffered six write- offs and fatal accidents.Arheim: 144 Between 17 and 27 April 1953 the squadron was relocated to V√¶rnes Air Station and became subordinate Air Command Tr√∏ndelag. Shooting training took place at Tautra, which opened in May of that year. There were two accidents that summer, one which was fatal. The unit participated in an exercise during the summer, when it was temporary located at T√∏nsberg Airport, Jarlsberg. In most of September 1954 the squadron was placed at Bardufoss for training. The Vampires were taken out of active service from late 1954. =Sabre= From 1 January 1955 the squadron was dedicated as a storage unit, relocated to Gardermoen and made responsible for storing 42 Vampires and 49 other aircraft of a wide range of obsolete models. Nearly all staff of the squadron was relocated, anticipating the arrival of the North American F-86K Sabre. The reactivation took place on 1 September 1955 and the first Sabre landed at Gardermoen twelve days later. Training was initially carried out with the Lockheed T-33A. The first F-86K was airborne on 1 November. The Sabres were intended for defence against possible Soviet attacks, using ground-controlled interception. They were all-weather fighters and advanced compared to the air force's other fighters. The 337 Squadron was therefore manned with experienced fighter crews.Duvsete: 139 Preserved Norwegian F-86K Four aircraft and equipment were destroyed in a hangar fire on 10 March 1956. The new 337 Squadron was declared operative in April. Norway initially took delivery of 60 F-86Kshttp://www.airvectors.net/avf86_2.html  04 Dec 18 during 1955 & 1956, of which half were allocated to the 337 Squadron and the other half to the 339 Squadron. Additionally four aircraft, of which two were allocated to 337, were delivered in June 1957 from Fiat licence-built production.Arheim: 145 The Sabre was a technically demanding aircraft, both to operate and to maintain. Assistance was needed through 1957 to train the crews. In the first years technical faults caused a high portion of grounded aircraft. In particular the electronic fuel controller and the radar would frequently break down. Lack of sufficient hangar capacity, forcing the aircraft to be stored outdoors, and insufficient training of mechanics contributed to the issues.Duvsete: 140 These issues were aggravated by a high turnover amongst mechanics at Gardermoen.Duvsete: 141 The squadron had two fatal accidents, in June and July 1958. They grounded the fleet and resulted in the installation of ejection seats. For the rest of the Sabres operation history the squadron had no accidents. For a longer period of 1959 they were operating out of Torp Air Station. F-86Ks were from 1961 gradually transferred to the 334 Squadron, which rebuilt them to F-86F. By 1963 the number of Sabres in Southern Norway was sufficiently small that the 332 and the 337 squadrons could merge. This took effect 1 September 1963, with the 332 Squadron taking over operations and the 337 Squadron being deactivated.Arheim: 146 =Lynx= Westland Lynx landing on NoCGV Senja During the 1960s and 1970s Norway carried out several extensions of its fisheries zone and established an exclusive economic zone. This led to discussion on the establishment of a coast guard.Jansen: 87 The Military Fisheries Surveillance represented one of very few exceptions in which military force could be used against Norwegian civilians.Terjesen: 460 Several organizational models were discarded, including a civilian agency, a continuation of an integrated model and a virtual coast guard made up of units from various branches. Instead the coast guard was organized as a separate unit under the navy. An important argument was to avoid duplicating services, such as an operative headquarters and naval bases. Meanwhile, the coast guard could act as a military presence to assert sovereignty.Terjesen: 461 The premise for the coast guard was that its largest offshore patrol vessels, the Nordkapp-class, would be equipped with helicopters.Jansen: 113 A 1976 commission considered the options and concluded that three rotorcraft met the criteria: the Westland Lynx, the Sikorsky S-76 and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk. It recommended the Seahawk, citing its supreme range, de-icing and cabin space. It was also suitable as to provide a unified helicopter fleet for the Air Force. The Navy preferred the Lynx, emphasizing its low cost, manoeuvrability, that most North Sea-countries were purchasing it and that it already was in British service. The Seahawk would not be operational until 1984. Parliament approved the purchase of six units in 1978.Jansen: 114 The squadron was reactivated on 1 January 1980. Bardufoss Air Station was a natural choice for the base of the helicopters. It was the only airbase in Northern Norway to have an existing squadron of helicopters and it was the only airbase to have sufficient space to house a new squadron. The base was prepared through the construction of a new main hangar and several auxiliary buildings.Jansen: 115 However, only a year after the squadron moved in were the buildings completed. Westland Lynx at Bardufoss Air Station in 1998 Training initially took place at RNAS Yeovilton, and the first Lynx landed at Bardufoss on 4 October 1981. In addition to the Nordkapp-class, the Lynxes trained with HNoMS Horten. During one of these missions it carried out its first live search and rescue mission, in the search after the Wider√∏e Flight 933 on 11 March 1982.Jansen: 116 The combination of naval and air force operations caused a significant amount of friction and initially there were difficulties with cooperation. As the training progressed most of these issues were resolved. The main issue was related to the border between the command of the helicopters between the ship's captain and the helicopter's pilot.Duvsete: 330 The squadron was declared operative in May 1983.Jansen: 117 The Lynx proved unreliable for the first decade of operation. The aircraft had a large number of technical problems, which were aggravated through long delivery times for spare parts. Secondly the 337 had high turnover, amongst both pilots and mechanics. This caused an excessive number of flight hours to be used for training instead of service. The latter was largely solved when the number of crew members was cut from six to three. This gave each crew member more tasks, which increased the contentment and decreased turnover.Duvsete: 331 Along with Denmark, Germany and Netherlands, a simulator was bought. This allowed more training there. Combined this allowed the Lynx to operate the requested number of service hours from 1992.Jansen: 119 Andenes carried out two research expeditions to the Antarctic, in 1984‚Äì85 and 1989‚Äì90 as part of the Pro Mare research program. It was also used to signal the Norwegian territorial claim to Dronning Maud Land and the Weddell Sea.Terjesen: 484 Andenes also participated in the Gulf War as Norway's contribution. It acted as a support ship of the Royal Danish Navy's Olfert Fischer frigate.Terjesen: 486 Andenes was dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea in May 2014 to participate in the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons. Replacing the frigate Helge Ingstad, Andenes was used to escort the freighter MV Taiko. The Lynxes were originally planned retired about 2005. However, delays with the delivery of the successors forced the Air Force to retain their Lynxes for a further nine years. Several of the helicopters exceeded their designed lifetime of 7,000 flight-hours by 2,000 hours. In the end the lack of spare parts was the main hindrance towards keeping the fleet airborne. The last departure from a Coast Guard vessel took place on 7 December 2014, after which the type was officially retired. =NH90= A prototype NHIndustries NH90 During the late 1990s the Air Force started considering replacing its fleet of helicopters. One aspect it considered was to buy a unified fleet, thus replacing the Lynx, the Westland Sea King search and rescue and the Bell 412 transport helicopters with one model. Norway took initiative in 1998 to establish the Nordic Standard Helicopter Program (NSHP), which would see a common unified model for the three Nordic countries. Four helicopters were considered: the AgustaWestland AW101, the NHIndustries NH90, the Eurocopter AS532 Cougar and the Sikorsky S-92. Norway initially considered placing an original order for eight Coast Guard helicopters and six for the then under planning Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates. Options would be places for a future ten SAR helicopters and fifteen troop transporters. Denmark and Sweden withdrew from NSHP and in September 2001 the Norwegian Armed Forces bought fourteen NH90 units. Eight of the helicopters will service with the Coast Guard and be allocated to the 337 Squadron. The rest will serve on the frigates and be allocated to the 334 Squadron. To utilize the new helicopters, four new helicopter-carrying vessels were ordered. Svalbard was commissioned in 2002 as the first icebreaking vessel of the Coast Guard.Terjesen: 470 The Barentshav- class consists of three vessels which were delivered from 2009 onwards.Terjesen: 472 The contract stipulated that delivery of the NH90 would commence in 2005. However, delays in production caused the first unit to not be delivered before 2011. Norway is the first country to take into use the navalized NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH) variant. The 337 Squadron aims to have the NH90 operational by 1 May 2015. Only nine units were delivered of the initinally ordered 14 pieces and non of them are in use as planned in early 2019.All deny blame for helicopter scandal, newsinenglish.no, February 1st, 2019 Operations The 337 Squadron is based at Bardufoss Air Station The 337 Squadron operated eight NHIndustries NH90 naval helicopters.Mo & S√¶lensminde: 275 They are long, have a cruising speed of and have a range of .Mo & S√¶lensminde: 274 The squadron is based at Bardufoss Air Station.Mo & S√¶lensminde: 273 The squadron's helicopters are exclusively used by the Norwegian Coast Guard. The squadron therefore maintains and operates the helicopters, while they are under command of the navy in terms of operative power. The helicopters can be used on board seven coast guard vessels, the three Nordkapp-class ships, the three Barentshav-class ships and Svalbard. They are used to extend the mobility and efficiency of the vessel's operation. At any given time at least two Coast Guard vessels have a Lynx on board, which remain on two-week cycles. They are predominantly used to patrol the coast off Troms, Finnmark and the Barents Sea, including the seas off Svalbard. The Coast Guard's main task is to assert and uphold Norwegian sovereignty over its inland waters, territorial waters and exclusive economic zone (EEZ).Terjesen: 462 Its structure is centred around a peace-time role,Terjesen: 473 and is part of the Royal Norwegian Navy.Terjesen: 463 The helicopters thereby assist in roles relating inspection and assistance of the fishing fleet, removing foreign objects at sea,Jansen: 105 and search and rescue missions.Ministry of Justice and the Police: 13 References Bibliography   Category:Royal Norwegian Air Force squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1950 Category:Military units and formations established in 1980 Category:1950 establishments in Norway Category:1980 establishments in Norway Category:Organisations based in Troms ","title":"No. 337 Squadron RNoAF"},{"id":"44654694","text":"Francisco Alejandro Moreno Merino (born 11 August 1966) is a Mexican lawyer and politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

It was written by the series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Carl Tibbetts. The episode follows Victoria (Lenora Crichlow), a woman who does not remember who she is and wakes up in a place where almost everybody is controlled by a television signal. Along with some of the few other unaffected people (Michael Smiley and Tuppence Middleton), she must stop the \\"White Bear\\" transmitter while surviving merciless pursuers. Brooker originally wrote the episode in an apocalyptic setting, but when the script was about to be filmed at a former Royal Air Force base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a plot twist at the end of the script, which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers. The episode, first aired on Channel 4 on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers and was very well received by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s Moors murders, in which five children were killed. Its horror aspects have been said to be reminiscent of the 1970s film The Wicker Man and the video game Manhunt, while some similarities with The Twilight Zone have also been noted. This dystopian episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, desensitisation, violence as entertainment, vigilantism, the concept of justice and punishment, and the nature of reality. Plot A woman (Lenora Crichlow) wakes up with amnesia, in a house where television screens are showing an unknown symbol. Turning the screens off, she finds photos of herself and a man (Nick Ofield), along with one of a small girl (Imani Jackman) which she takes with her. She leaves the house and pleads for help, but people ignore her while recording her on their phones. When a masked man opens fire at her with a shotgun, she flees and meets Jem (Tuppence Middleton). Jem explains that the symbol began appearing on television and mobile phone screens, turning most people into passive voyeurs. The woman and Jem are unaffected, but they are also a target for the \\"hunters\\", unaffected humans who act sadistically. Jem plans to reach a transmitter at \\"White Bear\\" to destroy it. As they travel, Baxter (Michael Smiley), a man who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where he tries to torture the woman, but Jem kills Baxter first. They continue travelling to the transmitter; when they reach it, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti. Walls open to reveal that everything was staged. The woman is strapped to a chair and informed that her name is Victoria Skillane, and that the girl in the photograph is Jemima Sykes, whom Victoria and her fianc√©, Iain Rannoch, had abducted and murdered. After the pair were arrested, Iain committed suicide in his cell, while Victoria was sentenced to undergo daily psychological punishment at the present facility, which is called White Bear Justice Park after a white teddy bear that Jemima owned. Victoria is driven back to the compound past an outraged crowd and returned to where she awoke. As she is shown footage of Jemima, Baxter places electrodes on her head, simultaneously torturing her and wiping her memory of the day's events. Over the end credits, the next day's events are seen from the point of view of the park's staff, and its visitors who play the voyeurs. Production Series creator Charlie Brooker came up for the idea while working on the 2008 zombie horror serial Dead Set. During filming, Riz Ahmed's character was being chased by zombies; some schoolchildren noticed the production and begun watching, taking pictures on their phones. Brooker considered it to be \\"an interesting and frightening image, because they're standing there, not intervening\\". Brooker converted it to a script for Dead Set, in which a photograph goes viral on social media and \\"unlock[s] this primal urge for people to be voyeurs of agony\\". Although the idea was given the green light, they did not have the budget to do it. The first conception of the episode was as \\"a straightforward apocalypse story\\", featuring a female journalist and taking inspiration from the 1967 science fiction horror film Quatermass and the Pit. The signal would have affected people all over the world, turning 90% of them into voyeurs and the rest into mad people who attacked each other; its source was never explained. It was to end with a public crucifixion. The glyph that appears on Baxter's balaclava, and elsewhere in the episode, was made by Brooker. The second version opened with a patient speaking to their psychiatrist about their nightmares and a recent urge to commit violence. The patient draws a glyph from their dreams, and the psychiatrist files it along with identical symbols drawn by her other patients. This glyph resembles an upside-down \\"Y\\" and was created by Brooker after much experimentation; it is the one used in the final episode. This draft had the character Baxter in it and resembled the 1973 horror film The Wicker Man. Executive producer Annabel Jones noted that the theme had shifted more towards voyeurism. By this point, director Carl Tibbetts was involved with the project. After working on the other series two episodes \\"Be Right Back\\" and \\"The Waldo Moment\\", the latter of which was in production, there was little of the budget remaining for \\"White Bear\\". Filming was limited to a military base at RAF Daws Hill in southeast England, which was formerly a United States Air Force base. The base contained an abandoned housing estate and buildings that could be repurposed to look like shops and garages. The base was surrounded by chicken wire and Brooker considered that the fence could be there because the events of the episode were not real. Brooker believed that the public would watch certain people be tortured for entertainment, such as Jimmy Savile‚Äîagainst whom hundreds of sexual abuse allegations have been made‚Äîor Myra Hindley‚Äîa serial killer who committed the Moors murders with her boyfrend, Ian Brady. Brooker then rewrote the script in two days \\"in a bit of a fever dream\\". He noted that he had never changed a script so dramatically so late in the production process, and that this is the first major plot twist in a Black Mirror episode. Brooker considered making Victoria innocent, but settled on making her unknowingly guilty. Lenora Crichlow had already been cast as Victoria prior to the rewrite. Prior to the twist, the episode is shown from Victoria's perspective. According to Tibbetts, handheld cameras were used to make the episode \\"very intense and personal\\" and to make the viewer identify with Victoria. Contrastingly, in the end credits scenes filming is \\"still and static\\" to resemble an observer's perspective. Flashback scenes were balanced to avoid giving away too much information before the twist. The scene in which Victoria is driven through the crowd was cut shorter in the final edit and many of the crowd members were added digitally. Brooker had the idea during editing of displaying Victoria's next day at the park during the credits. The episode is 42 minutes long, slightly shorter than Channel 4's standard of 45‚Äì48 minutes for an hour-long episode. The episode's soundtrack was composed by Jon Opstad. The score is mostly electronic. To give a different character to the music played as Victoria lives her next day in the theme park, Opstad added acoustic elements, but feeling that this did not fit with the universe he used pizzicato cello music and overlaid \\"spidery\\" atonal lines. Brooker had other ideas that were removed from the original script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts not to function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario. Cultural references Many reviewers identified an allusion to the Moors murders, committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, a British couple who killed children in the 1960s. The A.V. Club David Sims emphasised the similarities between Victoria's taping and the fact that Hindley taped the torture of one of their victims. The influence of horror works was highlighted by critics and Brooker himself. Lambie found aspects of the forest scene reminiscent of 1970s exploitation films. He also felt there are several visual and thematic parallels to The Wicker Man and Kill List. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy affirmed it is reminiscent of zombies and slasher films \\"and even has that unsettling Wicker Man feel with its notion of 'society gone wrong'.\\" Brooker commented it is indeed \\"a Wicker Man‚Äìstyle horror\\", and Tibbetts commented that the film was \\"a big touchstone\\" for him. Because they have similar concepts, 28 Days Later and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre were also mentioned by reviewers as possible influences. Paul Brian McCoy of Comics Bulletin stated it \\"recalls any number of zombie apocalypse dramas, including Brooker's own Dead Set at times\\" and The Signal. While Brooker said the hunters' design was inspired by the horror video game Manhunt, McCoy felt its opening echoed another game, Resident Evil. The Twilight Zone has been seen as an influence by some reviewers. Jeffery commented that Black Mirrors \\"roots in\\" the American anthology series \\"have never been more visible\\", while Sims affirmed \\"White Bear\\" is \\"the most Twilight Zone-y episode of the show\\", and James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly said it could even have been an episode of that series. Lyndsey Weber of Vulture made a \\"post-viewing guide\\" to Black Mirror, where she included The Twilight Zone episode \\"Five Characters in Search of an Exit\\" as \\"bonus watching\\" to \\"White Bear\\". Themes Despite the similarities to real murder cases, David Sims noted the focus is not any single case, arguing that when an \\"abhorrent crime\\" occurs people create \\"totem[s] of hatred and evil\\" from the figures involved in the crime. He said Brooker examines what he calls the \\"lurid media frenzy\\" trend. Lambie, as well as Aubrey Page of Collider, considered it was mainly directed towards tabloids' coverage of criminal cases that turns them into \\"witch hunts\\". Simon Cocks of Screen Anarchy affirmed it is an allegory of the Internet, but also a discussion on how society processes information and treats shocking news stories. Paste Roxanne Sancto wrote it is aimed at media's tendency \\"to turn horrific news stories into national spectacles, riling people up to the point of mass panic and violence in the process\\". Alfred Joyner of International Business Times stated \\"the argument is that in the media notorious criminals must be demonised to appease the public's insatiable appetite to see that 'justice' is served\\". Jon O'Brien of Metro and James Poniewozik of The New York Times identified vigilantism as a central concept in the story. Writing for Esquire, Corey Atad commented it is about the societal \\"appetite for punishment\\", while Sam Parker of The Huffington Post and Andrew Liptak of The Verge considered it represents \\"a cruel society's fantasy of 'real justice and a \\"perverted justice\\" respectively. More specifically, it deals with the remote punishment done via the anonymity of the Internet, according to some of TheWrap staff members and Page. While Sims stated there are parallels between Victoria's suffering and the crime she committed, Joyner considered these parallels to be central to the episode's critique. When her crime is revealed, Joyner wrote, \\"the construction of the White Bear centre becomes apparent now, as a real-life karmic experience for the general public who wish to see biblical retribution\\". Mark Monahan of The Telegraph wrote that the episode \\"mocked, above all, our insatiable, voyeuristic, neo-Medieval thirst for supposedly 'real-life' pain and humiliation repackaged as entertainment\\". Jeffery stated it depicted how society turns horror into entertainment, and Parker concluded, \\"The fact Victoria was a murderer allows them to accept her suffering, but it's the mobile phones that allow them to enjoy it‚Äîafter all, she's just a character on their screens.\\" Critics considered Crichlow's character's repeated suffering to be a plot device to evoke sympathy Liptak said it portrays people as victims of technology, while Joyner commented it denotes that \\"the way in which we are spoon-fed an almost constant stream of information through technology has turned us into passive consumers\\". Joyner believes that Brooker implicates the viewer with the story's credits scene, noting \\"we're the ones with the smartphones, passively absorbing abuses to human rights and decency, and yet revelling in the image from the safety of the screen\\". Jeffery and Parker affirmed it contains the idea that people are preferring to document life rather than living it, as exemplified by \\"people who see violence break out ... and decide to film it rather than intervene.\\" Leigh Alexander of Boing Boing said the episode reflects how violence is easily accessed on the Internet and quickly arouses people's attention. She noted, \\"you can view the episode as a critique of all kinds of themes: Mob mentality, reality television, even the complicated treatment of women in the justice system ... Primarily, though, this episode is a critique of our deep, often-unexamined mass desensitisation, or at least a dread portent of its potential to grow. It aims to ask: To what extent can you stand by and watch horror before you are complicit, punishable?\\" Brooker commented that after watching the episode, the viewer feels \\"sympathetic towards [Victoria] but also repulsed by what [she] did\\". Tibbetts opined that the episode is \\"about not torturing people\\" and Victoria's guilt is irrelevant to whether one should take pleasure from her torture. Sims said Victoria's suffering was shown to make the viewer sympathise with her, but noted it is difficult to do so because she committed an unforgivable crime, although her mental state is not entirely clear because of the fact \\"her mind has been erased so many times that the crime is barely a memory\\". Lambie stated it was done to explore \\"how human empathy breaks down when individuals are reduced to an image on a screen\\", and concluded, \\"whether it's directed at the innocent or the guilty, cruelty is still cruelty\\". Atad asserted it ultimately leads viewers to choose between their \\"so-called justice and the competing value of empathy\\". Writing for Sabotage Times, Gareth Dimelow concluded it leaves the viewer to ponder: \\"If someone has no recollection of their crimes, can they be effectively punished? Does our societal bloodlust for vengeance make us just as dangerous as the criminals we seek to discipline?\\" GamesRadar's Richard Edwards found that Brooker was able to present a \\"morally complex idea\\" without taking a side on the discussion. Sancto felt the episode \\"plays with the viewer's emotions ... making it all the more difficult to find a moral stance on her story in the end\\". Jones interpreted that Victoria is \\"incredibly remorseful\\" once she learns who she is, saying that Victoria's knowledge of what she did to the young girl is \\"obviously destroying her\\". In contrast, Brooker believes Victoria to only be feeling \\"confusion and animal fear\\" as her life is like \\"a nightmare in which society tells you're a child killer\\". Joyner stated the episode uses \\"the idea of having what the viewers are led to believe as reality exposed as a sham\\". Alexander affirmed this could be interpreted as questioning \\"the assumptions we bring to the things we see ‚Äì we can capture nearly any issue from all angles and pin it to virtual glass forever, but still only own a piece of the story, the unknowable remainder filled in by our own preconceptions\\". Alasdair Stuart of Bleeding Cool commented it \\"builds on this idea of the reflection that you know is fake but can't look away from and internalizes it\\". With the plot twist, Stuart said, \\"we're shown exactly what's been a reflection of the truth all along; everything\\". He also affirmed it questions \\"our own fundamental need to be the hero or heroine of our own story\\". Reception \\"White Bear\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 at 10pm on 18 February 2013. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode was viewed by an estimated 1.2 million viewers, which was 7.2% of the British audience. This was lower than the second series premiere, \\"Be Right Back\\", which was watched by 1.6 million people (9%). Brooker opined that \\"White Bear\\" is definitely the episode that provides \\"the most visceral, holy shit reaction from viewers\\", while Hibberd deemed it a \\"fan-favorite\\". The episode was very well received and appeared on several lists of the series' best episodes. Sancto deemed it the best episode among the first seven because its theme was presented \\"in a chilling manner\\", while O'Brien ranked it as the second-best. He called it \\"an intense watch from start to finish\\" and said \\"it's the episode which undoubtedly packs the biggest emotional punch\\". Page rated it the fourth-best among the thirteen episodes, asserting that it has an \\"ability to truly disturb\\" and \\"has put off many a viewer as spinning on a cheap twist, but despite the fact that the episode's impact does turn on a reveal, there's little in the episode that even feels remotely done before.\\" Mat Elfring of GameSpot placed it fifth out of thirteen, labelling it \\"the most successful horror episode [of the series] to date\\". Atad ranked it seven out of thirteen, saying it \\"begins a dystopian horror reminiscent of 28 Days Later, but where it ends up is far more disturbing\\". Out of the thirteen, Hibberd ranked it eighth, highlighting its plot twist and noting that \\"most [would] rank this episode much higher; I just happened to like the rest of the episodes better\\". Moreover, Stuart said it \\"may be one of the best hours of TV produced [in 2013]\\". He emphasised how it transits from \\"John Wyndham stuff\\" to horror and then action, and commended its final twist. He concluded: \\"The last fifteen minutes of White Bear are amongst the most blisteringly angry pieces of television I've ever seen.\\" It is considered to have \\"one of the most shocking twists on Black Mirror\\", as Jenelle Riley of Variety puts it, some time before the third series started. Writing before the third series, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times said it is \\"the most outright disturbing\\" episode of Black Mirror. Right after it aired, Cocks deemed it \\"the single darkest episode of Black Mirror so far\\" and considered its twist to be \\"nothing short of genius\\". Sims stated that it \\"is, by a significant margin, the most disturbing episode Black Mirror has produced\\". Although he praised the twist as \\"a smart one, brilliantly concealed and smartly revealed\\", he criticised it because \\"once the point is made, it is made over and over again.\\" Lambie praised its \\"fearsome pace\\" and highlighted \\"its subtle approach\\", with sparse dialogue, that gives \\"the events and performances greater impact\\". He concluded: \\"its horror-infused drama leaves us unsure whom we can trust or what will happen next, and its last act is truly gut-wrenching\\". Monahan wrote that the twist was unpredictable and the episode \\"was an exciting and efficient piece of narrative rug-pulling\\". Tuppence Middleton's performance was highly praised Regarding the acting and the characters, Sims and Monahan praised Middleton's performance. By contrast, Crichlow's role was considered to be repetitive. Monahan stated she just wailed, and Parker called it \\"a harrowing performance with no arc or resolutions, just sheer fear and distress\\". Lambie said: \\"If there's a criticism to be levelled at the first two-thirds of White Bear, it's that Victoria's carried helplessly along by events.\\" Simon said Crichlow's potential was wasted because of the script. Jeffery criticised the fact \\"Victoria maintains one emotional level across the episode ... she's tearful, panicked and terrified throughout\\", but he remarked it was not Crichlow's fault, while praising Middleton and Smiley as \\"uniformly excellent\\". Cocks was more favorable, praising Crichlow's commitment to her performance. He also attributed to her performance \\"one of the episode's greatest accomplishments ... how much it makes audience members feel as though they are in the position of [Victoria]\\". Edwards asserted she gave a \\"tour de force performance\\" that is \\"an excellent, convincing portrayal of a frightened, confused woman\\". Some reviewers had mixed feelings about the episode. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that \\"White Bear\\" lacked the \\"instant emotional tug\\" of the series opener. She commented that, a third of the way through the episode, she had lost hope that it would conclude effectively, \\"[...] the acting was unbelievable, the script was riddled with horror-film cliches, the violence was a bit over the top [...]\\", but that by the end she was positively surprised. Joyner praised it as \\"stylistically ... breath-taking\\" with \\"intense action\\", but felt \\"the themes come across as particularly flat\\" and \\"hardly original\\". He was disappointed until the twist, and concludes that Brooker has \\"crafted an hour of television more bold and daring than I've seen in a long time\\". Jeffery said \\"this is Black Mirror as full-blooded horror\\" and that it never gets boring, while criticising the characters and the final sequence as \\"a little overlong and obvious\\". TheWrap staff was divided; while some found it has a good social critique, others considered it to be \\"least effective when it goes for horror\\". Although Parker compared the first 45 minutes to \\"a low-budget, low-quality version of 28 Days Later\\", full of \\"horror movie clich√©s\\", he realised that was \\"the whole point\\". He was positive to its societal criticism and wrote: \\"So the reason it all felt like a rubbish horror movie for 45 minutes is because that's what it was, just with a real person in the centre of it.\\" It was ranked eleventh out of the thirteen episodes by Charles Bramesco of Vulture, who said its message is \\"lost beneath a simplistic twist that pulls a switcheroo and [it] fails to do much else\\".

It was written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Bryn Higgins, and first aired on Channel 4 on 25 February 2013. The episode originated in an idea for Nathan Barley, an earlier TV show by Brooker and Chris Morris. The episode tells the story of Jamie (Daniel Rigby), an unhappy comedian who plays a blue animated bear called Waldo in a satirical television programme. After a politician he interviewed‚ÄîLiam Munroe (Tobias Menzies)‚Äîenters a by-election to become member of parliament, Waldo stands as a candidate. Meanwhile, Jamie and another candidate Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie) develop feelings for each other. Waldo's popularity continues to rise, but Jamie becomes increasingly discontent with the role he is playing. The episode is in contrast to other Black Mirror episodes with its contemporary setting; it explores public distrust of politicians. Initially based in part on the politician and future British prime minister Boris Johnson, the character of Waldo was widely compared to business magnate Donald Trump following his successful 2016 campaign to become President of the United States. The episode was considered by critics to be very poor in comparison to other Black Mirror episodes, with criticisms made of its reliance on tropes and its ending. The characters of Waldo and Jamie received mixed reception. Plot On a topical comedy show, Jamie Salter (Daniel Rigby) plays Waldo‚Äîa vulgar, blue animated bear who interviews public figures under the pretence of filming a children's television programme. After Conservative politician Liam Munroe (Tobias Menzies) files a complaint over his interview, a television pilot of a programme starring Waldo is commissioned. Despite this, Jamie is dissatisfied with his life, particularly over a recent breakup. At a meeting led by producer Tamsin (Christina Chong), executive Jack Napier (Jason Flemyng) notes that Munroe is standing to become a member of parliament in the by-election for the constitutency of Stentonford and Hersham. It is agreed that Waldo should stand as a candidate. Playing Waldo on the side of a van, Jamie goads Munroe into confrontation as he campaigns. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie) has been chosen as the Labour Party candidate, though the constituency is a safe seat for the Conservatives. Harris and Jamie get drunk together, Jamie expressing his displeasure at being stuck as Waldo and Harris admitting she will not win. They have sex and promise to continue their relationship. Harris' campaign manager Roy (Michael Shaeffer) is alarmed that she talked to Jamie. Harris tells Jamie that she cannot see him during the campaign. Waldo and the other candidates are invited to a student-organised hustings, in which Munroe details Jamie's mostly unsuccessful television career and derides his message as meaningless. Jamie attacks both Munroe and Harris as disingenuous career politicians, using information Harris divulged during their encounter. Waldo's rant goes viral on YouTube and he is invited to an interview with Philip Crane (Pip Torrens) on Consensus. Jamie is reluctant to continue as Waldo but does so after Jack threatens to play him instead. Afterwards, Jack and Jamie meet with American agent Jeff Carter (David Ajala), who talks about the advantages of a cartoon figurehead over a human in spreading political messages. Jamie tries to apologise to Harris but she is furious with him. The next day, as Waldo, Jamie urges people not to vote for him; Jack takes over as Waldo and incites a member of the public to hit Jamie. In hospital, Jamie sees the results of the election: Munroe won, Waldo was second and Harris was third. In the final scene, Jamie is homeless and ordered to move on by police. He sees a screen displaying Waldo on every channel, in different languages. When he throws a bottle at it, the police taser and attack him. Production \\"The Waldo Moment\\" was the third episode of the second series of Black Mirror, produced by Zeppotron for Endemol. It aired on Channel 4 on 25 February 2013 at 10 p.m. On 22 January 2013, a trailer for the second series was released, featuring a dream sequence, a factory location and a large dust cloud. The advert ran on Channel 4 and in cinemas. A trailer for \\"The Waldo Moment\\" premiered on 19 February 2013. =Conception and writing= The episode was written by series creator Charlie Brooker. It originates from an idea by Brooker and Chris Morris, conceived when the pair were writing Nathan Barley in 2005. They imagined a politician based on the British virtual band Gorillaz, whose members are animated cartoon characters. When Brooker came to write the episode, he took inspiration for Waldo's character on British politician Boris Johnson, and Ali G was also an inspiration. J√≥n Gnarr, a stand-up comedian who became mayor of Reykjav√≠k, was another reference point, and after the episode idea was conceived. Chris Morris, with whom Brooker conceived the initial idea for \\"The Waldo Moment\\". Brooker said that the episode is \\"asking what satire's about\\". Some of Jamie's dialogue is based on Brooker's own perspective from his career, such as co- presenting 10 O'Clock Live, a political comedy which ran from 2011 to 2013. Brooker commented that the episode was rushed due to time constraints, as he was busy rewriting drafts of another series two episode, \\"White Bear\\". He had wanted to do more research, though he did consult with his sister-in-law Rupa Huq, a Labour politician. Brooker said in 2018 that the idea should have been executed in a longer format, such as a two-part episode, miniseries or movie. He also wanted Jamie to be in more jeopardy, and to further develop the idea of Waldo as a \\"lightning rod for dissatisfaction with politicians\\". He expressed regret at rejecting the idea of having Gwendolyn and Jamie be ex- partners. =Pre-production= Brooker based Waldo on Ratz, a virtual floating cat head from the first series of 1990s children's show Live & Kicking. As Waldo was controlled live during filming, using state-of-the-art live animation techniques, several months of pre-production work was done at the design studio Painting Practice. Staff at Passion Pictures worked on animation, having recently developed the animated meerkat Aleksandr for the advertising campaign Compare the Meerkat. =Filming= Bryn Higgins directed the episode. Describing the comedy as \\"implicit\\", Higgins aimed to film the episode in the style of a \\"fairly slick modern thriller\\". The technology shown in the episode was not too far beyond what was possible at the time, as Brooker wanted the episode to veer away from science fiction. The rig used mapped the emotions and facial movements of the performer onto the Waldo character, and it is seen in the episode. As well as Rigby, four puppeteers controlled Waldo, assigned to the roles of his eyes, his mouth, his body and the rest. Brooker requested Waldo's animation to be purposefully clunky so that the viewer would believe that Jamie was controlling him live. The Waldo van was taken to High Wycombe, a town in southeast England, where members of the public were involved in interacting with Waldo. Due to legal concerns, Waldo's penis was not shown in public. Following Liam Munroe's line \\"He's making the whole system look absurd. Which it may well be, but it built these roads\\", it was planned for the car to go over a pothole, but this was cut as it looked like a camera mistake. Analysis \\"The Waldo Moment\\" is a political satire and dystopia; it features aspects of dark humour. It differs from most previous episodes in its lack of science fiction elements and absence of technology as a key theme. It bears similarities to the programme's first episode, \\"The National Anthem\\", which also has a storyline where \\"the political process is subverted by the general public's insatiable appetite for stupidity and scandal\\", according to Sam Parker of HuffPost. \\"The Waldo Moment\\" explores distrust and apathy towards politicians. Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek summarised the episode's message in the phrase \\"self-absorption will be the death of politics\\", whilst Parker felt that the episode demonstrated \\"a desire for a more honest form of politics\\". Serena Davies of The Telegraph commented that the episode was \\"a mockery of the deeply compromised ideals of modern politics\\", whilst reminding viewers that politicians are \\"all we've got\\". Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy analysed that the episode criticises satire and \\"those who persecute others without having anything meaningful to say\\", and Emily Yoshida of Grantland believed that it exposed the issues of \\"cheap humour\\" being leveraged by politicians. Boris Johnson, a British politician who became prime minister in 2019, was an inspiration for Waldo's character. Brooker described Johnson as \\"quite a clown\\", opining that his image \\"inoculated him from criticism\\" and set him apart from other politicians, who were seen as \\"bland robots parroting the same platitudes\\". Three years after the episode aired, in 2016, the presidential campaign of business magnate Donald Trump began to take off. \\"The Waldo Moment\\" was seen as prescient with regards to Trump. Several news reports, including one by Chris Cillizza, political reporter for The Washington Post, compared Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to the episode. Brooker also compared Trump to Waldo, describing the latter as \\"an anti-politics candidate who's raucous and defensive\\" and \\"offers nothing\\". Brooker said that Trump and Johnson were both \\"entertainers\\" who \\"upend normality\\", and successfully predicted in September 2016 that Trump would win the election. On the night that Trump was elected, the Twitter account for Black Mirror posted in response: \\"This isn't an episode. This isn't marketing. This is reality.\\" The episode has also been compared to the 2019 election of Volodymyr Zelensky, a satirical actor and comedian, as President of Ukraine. Zelensky's campaign was almost exclusively restricted to the internet, with Adrian Karatnycky of Politico commenting that his campaign resembled Waldo's in that he \\"made no public speeches, held no rallies and gave no press conferences\\". Like Waldo, Zelensky had few clear policy positions prior to election. The character of Waldo was also compared to \\"Professor Pongoo\\", a candidate in the 2012 Scottish local elections who dressed as a penguin and received more first-preference votes than the Liberal Democrats. The technology in the episode was later compared with \\"animoji\\"‚Äîavatars in the style of emoji which animate in coordination with the user's facial movements. Animoji were announced in 2017 as a new feature of the iPhone X, and resembled the technology used to animate the fictional Waldo. Reception The episode aired on Channel 4 at 10 p.m. on 25 February 2013, and was watched by 1.28 million viewers, according to 7-day data from BARB. In contrast to previous episodes, it drew poor critical reviews at the time of broadcast. It was considered to be the weakest episode to date by Yoshida and the weakest of the series by Parker and Richard Edwards of GamesRadar+, though Luke Owen of Flickering Myth found it to be the \\"best and most ambitious\\" of the series. \\"The Waldo Moment\\" garnered ratings of four out of five stars in The Arts Desk, 3.5 out of five stars in GamesRadar+, three out of five stars in HuffPost and The Telegraph, and a C+ rating in The A.V. Club. The characters of Jamie and Waldo received mixed reviews. David Sims of The A.V. Club criticised the \\"frustratingly vague\\" motivations of Jamie's character, who was \\"poorly sketched out\\". Sims further reviewed that Waldo failed to be funny or to make meaningful comments. Edwards also criticised Waldo's dialogue and called him \\"too two-dimensional\\". He did, however, laud Waldo's virtual appearance and interactivity as a \\"fantastic premise\\" which was \\"brilliantly executed\\". Lisa-Marie Ferla of The Arts Desk praised the \\"perfectly-pitched comedy\\" in Waldo's speech on the student-organised panel. The writing was poorly received, with Parker describing it as \\"unfocused\\". Edwards found the storyline to be predictable and filled with tropes and Parker wrote that the characterisation in the episode was \\"riddled with stereotypes\\". Owen criticised that conclusions to the relationship of Gwendolyn and Jamie were \\"merely afterthoughts\\". Sims criticised the American think-tank meeting as \\"the laziest kind of spoofery\\" and Edwards concurred, calling it \\"totally unconvincing\\". However, in praise of the writing, Yoshida, Ferla and Owen believed the episode's storyline to be plausible. The ending was widely criticised. Lambie described it as \\"sudden\\" and \\"on-the-nose\\", Sims opined that it was \\"ludicrous\\", and Jeffery and Davies called it \\"half-baked\\" and \\"hammy\\", respectively.

Ting and the Ting Lab at MIT for site- specific labeling of proteins in living cells with chemical probes. Probes often have useful biophysical properties, such as fluorescence, and allow imaging of proteins. Ultimately, PRIME enables scientists to study functions of specific proteins of interest.  Significance  Protein labeling with fluorescent molecules allows the visualization of protein dynamics, localization, and protein-protein interactions, and therefore serves as an important technique to understand protein functions and networks in living cells. The protein labeling should have a high selectivity towards the protein of interest, and should not interfere with the natural functions of the protein. Although genetic coding of fluorescent proteins, such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP), is the most popular technique due to its high specificity, fluorescent proteins are likely to interfere with the functions of the protein to which they are fused because of their large sizes. There are multiple tagging tools, such as HaloTag, SNAP tag, and FlAsH, developed in order to overcome the weakness of traditional protein labeling with fluorescent proteins. However, they still have significant shortcomings either due to the large size of a tag or the low specificity of the labeling process. PRIME has been developed in order to achieve a high labeling specificity comparable to fluorescent proteins with small molecules.  Principles  In PRIME, a mutant enzyme LplA (lipoic acid ligase from Escherichia coli) first catalyzes the conjugation of the ‚Äúfunctional group handle‚Äù and LplA acceptor peptide (LAP), which is genetically fused to the protein of interest. ‚ÄúFunctional group handle‚Äù indicates a bridge molecule connecting a LAP tag to a fluorescent probe or fluorophore. Fluorescent probe reacts with the ‚Äúfunctional group handle‚Äù connected to the tag, and ultimately labels the protein of interest. Different chemical reactions can be utilized to attach the fluorescent probe to a complex consisting of the protein, the LAP tag, and the bridge: Diels-Alder Reaction, and chelation-assisted copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) (refer to Azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition). Two other versions of PRIME labeling technologies use mutant LplA proteins to directly incorporate a fluorophore to the LAP-tagged protein of interest.  Limitations  Despite the advantages of PRIME over other tagging methods, PRIME still has some possible limitations. First of all, the LAP tag may interfere with the function of proteins to which it is fused. It is recommended that the experimenters perform control experiments in order to make sure that the tagged recombinant protein functions properly. Secondly, even at a low concentration, chemicals such as the fluorescent probe can be toxic to the cells. Experimenters are also required to obtain the right balance between maximal signal of fluorescence and minimal disruption of cellular function.

Additional information  Franck Mwe di Malila, is currently in a major dispute with his family and his other, 15 siblings. The subject of the argument is the properties of his on 7 June deceased father, Edouard Mwe di Malila Apenela, who left his numerous children a large estate empire after his death. At the public hearing on 4 February the Supreme Court of Kinshasa Gombe made a judgment, which only acknowledges four children of Edouard Mwe di Malila, as legitimate heirs of which one is Franck Mwe di Malila. The 15 other potential heirs appealed against the decision demanding to set the judgment aside. The quartet, to which Franck Malila belongs to, is accused of defrauding the basis of the documents on which the Court based their judgment on. At a council meeting on 7 August 19 children were identified as legitimate heirs and it was decided that the four eldest brothers were merely temporarily obliged as representatives of the remaining siblings. The committee decided that they had six months to create an inventory. After this period, the quartet did not feel obliged to the agreements and decided to no compromising with the other siblings. One of the lawyers of the plaintiffs wrote a complaint with the argument that the judgment made on 4 February did not obtain this unanimous agreement.

History Whilst Divex publicly traces its roots back to 1790 and the formation of Barry, Henry and Cook (an Aberdeenshire foundry), its modern history begins in 1980 as Gas Services Offshore Ltd. In 1981 ex-US Navy diver Don Rodocker established a company called Gas Services Offshore Ltd in Aberdeen. Don brought together British inventor, Alex Copson's Helinaut valve with his Gasmizer reclaim system to provide the first practical heliox recovery system. His technology was proved on the highly successful HMS Edinburgh gold recovery project. The industry quickly adopted Gas Services reclaim system technology following the success of the Edinburgh salvage and the company became well established in Westhill, only 50 metres from the site of the current Divex headquarters. The company thrived and manufactured many gas reclaim systems throughout the 1980s until the offshore oil and gas industry suffered a major recession in 1987. At this point the company was majority owned by Air Products, it was diversifying and had formed subsidiaries: Hydrovision producing ROV's and Hyox, manufacturing hyperbaric medical chambers. Royal Australian Navy Clearance Diver preparing for a dive with Shadow Excursion rebreather during Exercise RIMPAC 2016 Another Aberdeen based company Mara Engineering, founded by former Divex Joint Managing Director Derek Clarke and providing subsea engineering design solutions, was also suffering from the effects of the 1987 downturn and a merger between the two companies allowed complementary services to be provided and overheads to be shared. In 1990, Gas Services Offshore founder Don Rodocker decided to return to his native US and a management buyout took place led by Derek Clarke who assumed the role of Managing Director. At this point the company was trading under the name Pressure Products Group (PPG) and retained the market identities of Mara Engineering, Gas Services Offshore and Hyox Systems. In the subsequent years other Aberdeen-based companies involved in diving and subsea equipment could see the benefits of becoming part of a larger group and a series of mergers and acquisitions followed. PPG acquired UWI Circle, one of its closest competitors in 1997, which was itself a result of a merger between UWI and Circle Offshore. This strengthened the company's position as the leading supplier of commercial diving equipment in the UK. The Finance Director of UWI Circle at that time was Douglas Godsman. In 1998 the management decided that the Company needed a single corporate identity. One of the acquisitions, Subsea Services, had itself bought out an American company called Divers Exchange, formed in the 1950s in Louisiana in the USA. Divers Exchange had over the years become abbreviated to Div-Ex. As the company now owned this name it was decided that this was the most appropriate name for the new company, and so in 1998 the name Divex was adopted to replace Pressure Products and so became the Divex of today. In 2001 Divex established a joint venture company Divex Domeyer in Germany to provide In-Service-Support to the German Navy, who had selected our Stealth EOD-M closed circuit non magnetic rebreather. In 2004 Divex acquired Southern Oceanics in Cape Town, South Africa to create Divex Oceanics and in the same year opened Divex FZE in Dubai, UAE. Divex FZE was closed in 2013.

The book was first published in 1827, then in 1834, with changes, and in its last form in Naples (1835), in a censored edition; Antonio Ranieri, a longtime friend of Leopardi's, had it published in the original text in 1845. Small Moral Works expresses most of the ideas collected in the Zibaldone di pensieri. The themes discussed in these Works are: the relationship between man and history, between man and other men, and, most importantly, between man and Nature, of which Leopardi develops a personal philosophical view; a comparison of past values and the present, static, degenerate situation; the power of illusions, glory and boredom. Unlike Leopardi's Canti, Small Moral Works was written entirely in 1824. Different editions show the addition of later dialogues and other adjustments.  Background  The works reflect the conviction that reason, far from being the cause of man's unhappiness, is the only means by which man can avoid despair. Leopardi reached this final point of his reflection about human condition in the years 1822‚Äì1824, and in 1824 he conceived the \\"Operette morali\\", which collected and elaborated in a dramatic and ironic expression the philosophical research developed in the Zibaldone. In this period, Leopardi, believing that his lyrical voice has vanished, devoted himself to philosophical prose. A first idea of this work can be traced in the plan of some \\"prosette satiriche\\" (satirical prose), \\"alla maniera di Luciano\\" (following the style of Lucian).Dialoghi satirici alla maniera di Luciano, ma tolti i personaggi e il ridicolo dai costumi presenti e moderni, e non tanto tra i morti [...], quanto tra personaggi che si fingano vivi, ed anche volendo, fra animali [...]; insomma piccole commedie, o Scene di Commedie [...]: le quali potrebbero servirmi per provar di dare all'Italia un saggio del suo vero linguaggio comico che tuttavia bisogna assolutamente creare [...]. E questi dialoghi supplirebbero in certo modo a tutto quello che manca nella Comica Italiana, giacch√© ella non √® povera d'intreccio d'invenzione di condotta ec., e in tutte quelle parti ella sta bene; ma le manca affatto il particolare cio√® lo stile e le bellezze parziali della satira fina e del sale e del ridicolo attico e veramente e plautino e lucianesco [...].Giacomo Leopardi, Disegni letterari, Recanati, 1819, in:Ottavio Besomi, Scritti vari e inediti, Milano,1979 In Italian literature, nothing similar to the Operette can be found. Leopardi imitates Lucian's comical style with wit and humor, and moves through different levels of language. He even mixes various genres and themes. Apart from Lucian, the most significant models in literary style come from the Enlightenment. Leopardi appreciates Fontenelle for his \\"leggerezza\\" (lightness), while in Dialogo della Natura e di un Islandese, one can perceive some of Voltaire's cynicism. Among the Italians, Leopardi admired Ariosto, whose \\"comical style\\" he imitates in Dialogo della Terra e della Luna. The extensive knowledge of a great number of works, both philosophical and scientific, are the basis for the humorous and frivolous erudition that Leopardi ironically flaunted. A philological research about the sources that Leopardi cites or merely re-uses in the Operette, in a constant intertextual dialogue, is still lacking. Analysis This book is particularly important in the evolution of Leopardi's ideology, and the dialogues have intense lyrical value. As Mario Fubini observed, in the Operette one finds some myths- concepts: happiness, pleasure, love, hope, nature, which are also central themes in the Canti. Happiness is absurd and impossible, but can seem lovable in its deceptive apparitions; pleasure is only a vain ghost; hope inspires pleasant imaginations even if it has no basis; love is a rare miracle that can give man the only real happiness, though short-lived; nature is indifferent or hostile to men, who anyway feel fascinated by natural beauty.Mario Fubini, Introduzione a G. Leopardi, Operette Morali, Loescher, Torino, 1966 = The title = The title ties the satirical form with the moral purpose. Operette is a humble diminutive: these are short texts, which the author considers small both in size and in value. Their shortness enhances the bright philosophical and poetic strength, while morali stresses the philosophical subject. There is an implicit link to Opuscula moralia by Plutarch. The title comes also from the practical message: since modern philosophy with its truth makes man unhappy, going back to ancient passions and imaginations could make life less unbearable or, at least, suggest ways to soothe sorrow. = Themes = The themes revolve around the philosophical ideas of the author: the relationship of mankind with History and Nature, the comparison with the valours of the past and the degenerated situation of the present, illusions, glory and boredom. One of the most famous dialogues is the Dialogo della Natura e di un Islandese, in which the author expresses his main philosophical ideas, through the imaginary meeting, \\"in the heart of Africa\\", between a simple man coming from Iceland and a giant, beautiful and terrible woman, Nature, who has been chasing and oppressing him everywhere. Another important text is the Dialogo di Plotino e di Porfirio, in which two ancient philosophers, Plotinus and Porphyry, debate on the meaning of life and the choice of death as a possible exit from the senseless existence. The dialogue ends by refusing suicide, not in the name of superior rules or religious creeds, but in the name of human solidarity. Men have so many causes of sorrow that it would be wrong to add them another one, as the loss of a friend or a loved person. Instead, says Plotinus, \\"let us help each other to endure this struggle of life, which anyway will be short\\". In the earlier poems Bruto minore and Ultimo canto di Saffo, suicide is presented, instead, as the action of a great soul rejecting cowardice and bleakness of life. The last dialogue, Dialogo di Tristano e di un Amico, reflects Leopardi's experience and thoughts in the person of Tristano. The name of this character is inspired by the famous legendary hero, and by Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy.Giacomo Leopardi, Operette morali, a cura di Marco Antonio Bazzocchi, Mondadori, Milano 1991, p.328 The incipit describes the \\"Operette\\" themselves as a \\"melancholic book\\", and \\"a desperate one\\". Later, however, Tristan ironically expresses admiration for the new times and for the optimistic faith in a better future, but he ends up by proudly affirming his refusal of all illusions, and by courageously facing \\"tutte le conseguenze di una filosofia dolorosa, ma vera (all the consequences of an agonizing but true philosophy)\\".

The name Ibn al-Ikhshad or Ibn al-Ikhshid derives from the Persian title ikhshid. From 890 until 897, the city of Tarsus and the borderlands (thughur) with the Byzantine Empire were controlled by the autonomous Tulunid dynasty of Egypt, but in 897 a pro-Abbasid party under Raghib took power in the city and arrested the Tulunid governor Damian and other pro-Tulunid officials. Envoys were then sent to the Abbasid capital Baghdad to ask for the appointment of a new governor. This was done, as Caliph al-Mu'tadid appointed Ibn al-Ikhshad as governor (amir), the latter leaving Baghdad to take up his post on 17 April 898 along with the Tarsiote envoys. In the same winter (December 898/January 899) he undertook a raid against the Byzantines, reaching the fortress of Salandu (Traianopolis), which he captured, returning to Tarsus in early 899. Following the arrest of Raghib at Raqqa in August 899, Ibn al-Ikhshad arrested his servants and confiscated his possessions in Tarsus. Ibn al-Ikhshad was killed in another expedition into Byzantine territory shortly after, probably in early 900, leaving Abu Thabit as his deputy and successor behind him.

It was created in 1964 as the Center for Labor Research and Education and is a unit of the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. History As organized labor in the U.S. reached its height of influence after the Second World War, the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Berkeley, California created industrial relations programs under the initiative of Governor Earl Warren. The Institutes were tasked with outreach to both employers and trade unions, but by the 1960s Labor felt itself the junior partner in the arrangement. An agreement between the California AFL-CIO and the University of California led in 1964 to the founding of Centers for Labor Research and Education at UCLA and UC Berkeley focusing on issues such as job displacement, the needs of white collar unions, reducing hours of work, and the problems of unemployment. In 2002, the Labor Center opened a downtown location overlooking MacArthur Park in a building that was formerly a union hall. The Downtown Labor Center has supported groups such as the National Day Labor Organization Network, the California Construction Academy, and the Los Angeles Black Worker Center. The Labor Center is also home to the Dream Resource Center, an action research center focusing on issues of immigrant integration, particularly related to undocumented youth. Labor Center research has led to county and state actions to mitigate wage theft.

It opened theatrically on February 27, 2015 in select markets through AMC, and stars Edy Ganem, Luis Guzm√°n, Michael Steger, Juan Pablo Gamboa and Elizabeth Pe√±a in her final film role. It was developed and distributed by Fluency, as part of NBC Universal.  Plot  Ana Maria (Edy Ganem) is a bored twentysomething living in Los Angeles. After she gets fired from her job, bails on her best friend (Carla Morrison), and blows off her sister‚Äôs (Mercedes Masohn) bridal fitting, Ana Maria gets into a fight with her mother (Elizabeth Pe√±a) and father (Nestor Serrano) about where her life is going. Her only solace at the end of a crummy day is watching the telenovela Pasi√≥n Sin Limites (Passion Without Limits) which features her favorite bad girl character, Ariana Tomosa (Edy Ganem). In the novela, Ariana has just been blackmailed by the evil lawyer Schmidt (Luis Guzm√°n) after being caught in a love triangle between the wealthy Eduardo (Juan Pablo Gamboa) and his sexy son Armando (Michael Steger). When both Ana Maria and Ariana simultaneously complain about their lives, lightning strikes and the two women switch places. Ana Maria thinks she's having the best dream ever and begins to live out all of her novela fangirl fantasies as Ariana: romancing the two leading men and enjoying the pampered life of the volatile leading lady. Back in the real world, Ariana believes she's been kidnapped, runs away from Ana Maria's family, slaps a cop and gets bailed out of jail by Ana Maria's neighbor, the cute boy next door, Tony (Michael Steger). In Novela Land, Ana Maria‚Äôs romp is interrupted when she gets a call from her best friend who warns that Ana Maria might be stuck in the show forever unless she can figure out why she ended up there in the first place. Meanwhile, in the real world, a psychiatrist (Tamara Taylor) diagnoses Ariana as having amnesia and advises Ana Maria's parents to cut their flaky daughter some slack. Comforted by Ana Maria's family and the lovestruck Tony, Ariana begins to enjoy her new life as Ana Maria. The real Ana Maria has a made mess in the novela, alienating everyone and putting her life in jeopardy. But using her knowledge of novelas, Ana Maria conceives a plan to set things right: she fakes her own death, gathering all the characters at her wake and confesses that her selfishness has caused them all undue grief. Her admission triggers the novela's final twist: the return of the novela's secret villain played by the legendary Lupita Ferrer. After Schmidt shoots Ana Maria in the stomach, she takes one final selfie. This epic moment transports Ana Maria and Ariana back to their respective worlds. Ariana returns with the desire to explore a world bigger than the novela written for her and Ana Maria makes it back in time to serve as her sister‚Äôs maid of honor ‚Äì the supporting role she refused to play before the start of her journey.

Joey Leydon of Variety called it an \\"overlong but modestly amusing bilingual indie\\", opining that \\"Those who have at least a nodding acquaintance with the highly addictive serial dramas (telenovelas) will smile even more often than the uninitiated as director and co-scripter Georgina Garcia Riedel (‚ÄúHow the Garcia Girls Spent Their Summer‚Äù) affectionately satirizes both the limited-run series and their most avid aficionados.\\"https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/film-review-ana- maria-in-novela-land-1201443592/ Referring to the film as a \\"future slumber party classic\\", Inkoo Kang said in The Wrap, \\"This switching-places comedy warmly and trenchantly sends up the telenovela genre‚Äôs swooning melodrama and oversexed-but-prudish contradictions.\\" She offered another positive take stating the film was: \\"A spirited dual performance by Edy Ganem and a pointed telenovela spoof breathe plenty of life into a comedy that offers comfort through familiarity.\\"https://www.thewrap.com/ana-maria-in-novela-land-review- edy-ganem-luis-guzman-elizabeth-pena/ Chuck Wilson of LA Weekly called the film ambitious and praised it for having a great set up. He also criticized it, saying, \\"By its nature, the telenovela world is funnier than ours, but here it's never as inspired as you might hope. Ganem and her talented co-stars work hard, but Riedel's pacing is always a beat or two behind their mad energy, making for a film that's enormously appealing but not quite addicting.\\"http://www.laweekly.com/movies/ana-maria-in-novela-land-5301828 Bel Hernandez of Latin Heat said, \\"Director Georgina Garcia Riedel directing of the cast, has enabled the film to successful navigate from film to telenovela ‚Äì with just enough of the stereotypical telenovela melodramatic acting to not get in the way.\\"http://www.latinheat.com/everything-related-to- film/film/fluency-banking-on-telenovelas-on-te-big-screen/ Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \\"While this effort directed and co-scripted by Georgina Garcia Riedel lacks true comic inspiration, it provides some genial laughs along the way. ... Despite its relatively brief running time, the film runs out of comic steam long [before] the convoluted proceedings reach their conclusion, with the spoofery having the feel of an overextended variety show skit. But it's mostly enjoyable nonetheless, thanks largely to the charms of its young star who is clearly destined for bigger things.\\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ana-maria-novela-land- film-777694  References   External links  * Category:2015 films ","title":"Ana Maria in Novela Land"},{"id":"44655131","text":"Diaphania adelalis is a moth in the family Crambidae.

Both components are amongst the most massive and most luminous stars known, and the system is the most massive known binary system. Binary NGC 2070 region. MK 34 is the bright isolated star to the left of the R136 cluster in the righthand panel. Melnick 34 is a binary star with an orbital period of 155 days. It shows high x-ray luminosity characteristic of colliding-wind binaries, and periodic variations in luminosity, spectral absorption, and the x-ray brightness. The orbit has been calculated based on spectroscopic observations with the Very Large Telescope. The two components have identical spectral types of WN5h and the spectral lines of each vary every 155 days, indicating projected orbital motions with speeds of and respectively. The similar orbital speeds show that the two components have similar masses; the secondary has amass 92% of the primary, assuming an inclination near . The inclination of best matches the orbital properties of the two stars to their observed properties. The primary is designated A and the secondary B. The orbit is moderately eccentric, with a periastron separation of about . Physical characteristics R136 in NGC 2070, with Mk 34 just to the left of the central concentration The two components of Mk34 have identical spectral classes of WN5h, having spectra with prominent emission lines of highly-ionised helium, nitrogen, and carbon. The h suffix indicates that the spectrum also contains lines of hydrogen which are not usually seen in Wolf-Rayet spectra. The strength of the helium emission lines in the spectrum shows that the outer layers of the star consist of 35% helium. The WN5 spectral class indicates an extremely high photospheric temperature. Modelling the profiles of several spectral lines gives an effective temperature of for each star. The primary star has a bolometric luminosity of about and a radius of about , while the secondary has a luminosity of about and a radius of about . The masses of the two components inferred from their spectra are about and respectively. The masses determined from the orbit of the stars depends strongly on the inclination of the orbit, which is poorly known. The best match with the observed masses is found for orbits with an inclination near . The emission line spectra of the two stars in the Mk34 system are caused by strong mass loss which produces a dense stellar wind. Both stars have a stellar wind with a velocity of about causing each star to lose more than the mass of the sun every , a billion times stronger than the sun's wind. Evolution Although Wolf-Rayet stars are typically old stars that have lost their outer layers of hydrogen, some are very young massive stars which still contain hydrogen. Both stars in the Mk34 system are very young, and the helium, carbon, and nitrogen fusion products in their spectra are produced by the strong convection that occurs in massive main sequence stars and by rotational mixing. The stars are rotating at about and respectively. Modelling the evolution of the stars gives ages of about , with current masses of about and respectively, and initial masses of and respectively. These are similar to the masses deduced from observation. The stars are expected to have a hydrogen-burning lifetime of about 2.2 Myr, and are not expected to experience significant mass exchange during their evolution. Both stars should reach core collapse with masses too high to produce a normal supernova. Instead they are likely to produce a weak supernova followed by collapse to a black hole, or directly collapse to a black hole with no visible explosion.

He is recognised as a significant figure in contemporary New Zealand ceramics, and a leading figure in contemporary MƒÅori clay art. Early career and training After leaving school, Taepa worked as a window display designer for a Wellington department store for five years. He enlisted with the New Zealand Army in 1968 and served in Vietnam from 1970 to 1972. After his military career, Taepa worked as a prison officer at Rimutaka Prison, where he used art as a way of connecting with prisoners, teaching wood and bone carving and leather and copper work. He also took part in carving two pou for the Michael Fowler Centre in Wellington at this time and worked on the Orongomai meeting house in Upper Hutt. In 1985 Taepa became a social worker at Kohitere Boys Farm and again introduced art as a form of connection and rehabilitation. He began working with clay at this time as obtaining wood for carving was expensive and the tools potentially dangerous. After the closure of Kohitere Taepa enrolled in the four-year course for the New Zealand Certificate of Craft Design at Whitireia Polytechnic, graduating in 1992. In 1999 he graduated from Wanganui Polytechnic with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. In 2007 he received a Masters of MƒÅori Visual Arts from Massey University, Palmerston North.  Career as a clay artist Taepa dates his interest in clay back to the 1960s, when he saw an exhibition of ceramics by an English artist, Jo Munro, at Willeston Gallery in Wellington. In 1985, while living in Levin and working at Kohitere, he attended night classes with the Levin Pottery Club. He prefers to handbuild his work rather than throw it on the wheel. In 1986 Taepa, alongside Baye Riddell, Paerau Corneal, Colleen Waata Urlich and Manos Nathan formed NgƒÅ Kaihanga Uku, a collective of MƒÅori clayworkers. In 2013 Uku Rere, an exhibition of the five founding members, was held at Pataka Art + Museum. In 2014 Uku Rere subsequently toured to Whangarei Art Museum: Te Manawa Toi, the Suter Art Gallery: Te Aratoi o Whakatu, Waikato Museum: Te Whare Taonga o Waikato, Tairawhiti Museum: Te Whare Taonga o te Tairawhiti, and Te Manawa Museum of Art, Science + History, Palmerston North. Taepa has exhibited both nationally and internationally including a solo exhibition Wi Taepa at City Gallery Wellington (2012), NgƒÅ Toko Rima at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (2005), Kiwa at Spirit Wrestler Gallery, Vancouver (2003), and the National Gallery of Zimbabwe (1995). He has received support from Creative New Zealand to attend residencies and carry out research. In 2016 a major survey of Taepa's work, Wi Taepa: Retrospect was organised by Pataka Art + Museum. The exhibition travelled to Auckland Art Gallery in 2018. Taepa has continued to teach, including at Te Whare WƒÅnanga o AwanuiƒÅrangi. He says 'I'm interested in using clay as a form of creative expression. Teaching is also an art, so combining clay and teaching is an enjoyable challenge'. Public collections Taepa's work in held in private collections and also in public collections including the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and Auckland Art Gallery. Family Taepa descends from a line of Te Arawa master carvers. He assisted his uncle, Taunu Tai Taepa, with carving the pulpit in Rangiatea Church, Otaki. Taepa's sons Ngataiharuru Taepa and Kereama Taepa are also respected contemporary artists. The three artists showed work together in 2013 in the exhibition Papa Tipu at Expressions Whirinaki in Upper Hutt. And also has another son Tai Taepa that lives in Auckland.

He was born at Westminster, London and died in the fighting of the First World War near Loos, France. Eric Penn was the eldest son of William Penn, a cricketer and a businessman who ran the family engineering company of John Penn and Sons founded by his own father, John Penn, which was based in Greenwich, London. Eric Penn was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Penn played cricket as a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler while at school. At Cambridge, he played in a few first-team games in 1898 but did not consolidate his place in the side and was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University. In 1899, he played regularly as a lower-order batsman and bowler and in the match against the MCC he took five second-innings wickets for 47 runs, the best bowling performance of his first- class cricket career. He was awarded a Blue, though he took only one wicket in the 1899 University Match. There was then a hiatus in Penn's university and cricket career, as he joined the 3rd (Militia) battalion of the Royal Scots as a lieutenant on 30 August 1899. The battalion was embodied in December 1899 to serve in the Second Boer War, and in early March 1900 left Queenstown on the SS Oriental for South Africa. He returned to both Cambridge and cricket for the 1902 season, when he had less success as a bowler but more as a batsman, scoring 51 not out in the match against Ireland, his only half-century. He won a second Blue but again made little impact in the University Match. Penn appears to have left Cambridge University without taking a degree. He played in only one further first-class cricket match ‚Äì a single game for MCC against Cambridge University in 1903. From 1899 to 1906 he played Minor Counties cricket for Norfolk, where his father had bought Taverham Hall near Norwich. On the outbreak of the First World War, Penn joined the Norfolk Yeomanry; he transferred to the 4th Battalion of the Grenadier Guards in April 1915 and was promoted to the rank of captain in September that year, a month before he was killed in the fighting of the Battle of Loos. In 1906, Penn married Gladys Eveleen Ebden, daughter of Charles Ebden of Baldslow Place near Hastings in East Sussex.

History  The Aransas Pass Light Station was one of original Texas stations of the Lighthouse Service, that was formed in 1851, and merged into the Coast Guard in 1939. The Board wrote Inspector Stevens, \\"‚Ä¶it is very important that the Sabine, Aransas Pass, Shell keys, Ship Shoal, Barataria, & Timbalier Lights should be built as soon as possible.\\" The lighthouse is the second oldest on the Texas coast and the oldest surviving structure in the Aransas Pass-Corpus Christi area. When the Aransas Pass shifted, the light station was not needed and a new light was installed on Port Aransas. The Light was extinguished and the property delisted in 1952, and the property considered surplus. It was sold at auction in 1955. The channel was renamed Lydia Ann Channel and the light station Lydia Ann Light Station.  Current  H-E-B CEO Charles Butt purchased the light station, hired a caretaker, remodeled and restored the structures after a hurricane, and put the automated lighthouse back into service in 1988. It is currently the only light station on the Texas coast to have an on-site caretaker and as of 2012, Rick Reichenbach is currently the second.

Governor Ibn al-Ikhshad left him behind in the city as his deputy and successor when the former went on a raid against the Byzantine Empire in late 899/early 900. Ibn al-Ikhshad was killed during the raid, and Abu Thabit succeeded him. He soon had to face a Byzantine counter-raid, which in March 900 reached the gates of Tarsus. Abu Thabit pursued the Byzantines to the river Rayhan (unidentified), but there was defeated and captured. According to al-Tabari, along with other Muslim prisoners he was taken prisoner to Iconium and thence to Constantinople. Back in Tarsus, his son tried to take over his post, claiming that his father had appointed him as his successor, but this was opposed by the elders of Tarsus and the surrounding towns of the thughur, who chose Ali ibn al-Arabi. Abu Thabit's son armed followers to impose himself by force, but in the end was persuaded to accept Ibn al-Arabi.

It was built for Fedder Jensen. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Astrea, a two- storeyed timber building, was constructed as a pair of semi-detached houses. The architect may have been John Ibler, who in February 1888 called tenders for a pair of semi-detached brick and wood residences in Bank Street. They were erected for Fedder Jensen as an investment, and rented to white collar tenants. These included his son Magnus Jensen, a solicitor and Member of the Queensland Legislative Council 1904-15, who is first listed in the post office directories as resident on the east side of Bank Street in 1888. In 1909 the building was sold to Thomas and Harriet Walters, who converted it into a single residence, and possibly gave it the name Astrea. After falling into a state of disrepair Astrea was sold in 1981 and refurbished as a pair of semi- detached houses.  Description  Astrea is a pair of two-storeyed semi- detached timber houses. A double-storeyed verandah runs across the front of the building. This is ornately decorated with cast-iron valances, posts, frieze and balusters. The building has a single hipped roof in corrugated iron. The separate identity of each house is highlighted by a small gable at either end of the top verandah, each with an intricate fretwork pediment. These are supported by double columns which continue down to the lower level and flank the entry on the ground floor. Leadlight fan and sidelights surround the cedar panelled front doors. The internal joinery is also cedar. During the conversion to a house, the brick party wall was opened and one staircase was removed. Recent refurbishment has included the replacement of these features as well as double-storeyed additions at the rear.  Heritage listing  Astrea was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Astrea at West End, erected , is significant as a rare Brisbane example of a pair of semi- detached timber houses built in the late 19th century, and as an example of a speculative multiple housing venture of the 1880s boom period. They are important also in illustrating the development of West End in the years prior to the floods of 1890 and 1893. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.

After reviewing a matrix of all 10 options and weighing each on several factors identified as relevant, committee members ranked the choices; based on committee votes, the three preferred choices were (1) to keep K-5 students in Lambertville and West Amwell, while moving 6th grade to the high school complex, (2) keeping all facilities at their present locations with equity additions as needed and (3) a consolidated K-12 at a single site.District Wide Master Planning Study: Phase II - Board Summary, South Hunterdon Regional School District, February 29, 2016.

The book was adapted into a screenplay written by Michael Bronner. Early life and background Egyptian-Canadian award-winning journalist and author Fahmy was born in Egypt on April 27, 1974. He has reported extensively in the Middle East, North Africa and North-America for BBC, CNN, and Al Jazeera English. He covered the Iraq War in 2003 for the Los Angeles Times and entered Iraq on the first day of the ground war. Upon completion of his one-year mission, he authored his first book, Baghdad Bound. Fahmy spent the following two years reporting for Dubai Television, producing dozens of segments for a prime time television talk show focused on social issues in the Persian Gulf states of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and the UAE. In 2007 he completed a one-year mission as a protection delegate for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Lebanon, protecting the rights of political prisoners, refugees and the missing. In 2011, he was honored with a Peabody Award along with the CNN team for the network's coverage of the Arab Spring. The following year he won the Tom Renner Investigative Reporting award for producing the CNN Freedom Project documentary series \\"Death in the Desert\\". For the first time, the series exposed the organized crime rings operating the illegal human trafficking of Sub-Saharan Africans to Israel through its Sinai border with Egypt. Fahmy co-authored Egyptian Freedom Story. The book is a photo documentary of the January 25th revolution of 2011. In September 2013, he accepted a new post as the Al Jazeera English Egypt Bureau Chief. On December 29, 2013, Fahmy was arrested along with his colleagues Peter Greste and Baher Ghorab. The trio is accused of conspiring with a terrorist group and fabricating news to portray Egypt in a state of civil war. Fahmy has suffered a permanent disability in his right arm, as he was forced to sleep on the floor in solitary confinement of a freezing, insect-infested cell in the terrorist wing for the first month of his detention, worsening an injury he had sustained before his arrest and mis-healing his bones. Fahmy received the Canadian Commission World Press Freedom Award and a certificate from the UNESCO on World Press Freedom Day dated May 3, 2014, which coincided with his appearance in court. World Press Freedom Day on 3 May 2014 Fahmy received the Canadian Commission World Press Freedom Award and a certificate from the UNESCO on World Press Freedom Day dated May 3, 2014, which coincided with Fahmy's appearance in court. He was allowed out of the cage to explain the nature of journalism to the judge. He reminded judge Nagy Shehata that ; \\"the world is watching\\" and asked for bail. His request was overruled after the judge wished him and his colleagues a \\"Happy Press Freedom Day\\" On June 23, 2014, Mohamed Fahmy was sentenced to seven years in a maximum-security prison. International news organisations called the trial a farce. US Secretary of State John Kerry was highly critical of the sentences of Fahmy and his co-workers, terming them \\"chilling and draconian\\" and noted he had spoken to Egyptian governmental officials including President Abdul Fattah al- Sisi. The Egyptian president the following day announced that he would not interfere with the judiciary. Fahmy along with his Al Jazeera English colleagues were seen internationally as political prisoners. Mohamed Fahmy and his colleagues were awarded the Royal Television Journalism Judges' Award announced in London in February 2015. Fahmy draws strength from similar experiences of his father who was imprisoned and placed on a watch-list for his writing and critique of the Mubarak regime before the January 25th revolution. Career =2011 Egyptian Revolution= Fahmy reported live from the scene of the Israeli Embassy attack in Cairo in September 2011 and saved an American PBS NewsHour crew and senior correspondent Margaret Warner from a mob attack while covering the embassy attack.

A Peabody Award was granted to Fahmy in 2011 for his contribution to the CNN coverage of the Arab Spring. =Arab Spring= In his role with CNN, he reported extensively on the fall of Hosni Mubarak during the January 25th revolution and on the Syrian uprising. He traveled to Libya during the early days of the revolution in 2011 and reported on the hunt for dictator Gaddafi, the formation of a transitional government and the rise of extremism. In 2012, he covered the elections that brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power in Egypt and was the first western journalist to interview Mohamed Al Zawahiri , the brother of the Al Qaeda leader upon his release from prison. =Journalism Awards= * Tom Renner Investigative Reporting Award in 2011 for producing Death in the Desert broadcast on the CNN Freedom Project program.

Fahmy Foundation partnered with Amnesty International in writing a Protection Charter presented to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the liberal government in Ottawa. The document entails 12 practical steps for the government to reform and strengthen its mechanisms to protect Canadian citizens, permanent residents, journalists, and individuals with close Canadian connections from serious human rights violations in other countries. =Al Jazeera English= On 5 May 2015 Mohamed Fahmy sued Al- Jazeera for $100 million Canadian dollars ($83m; ¬£53m) in a British Columbia court. The punitive and remedial damages are demanded for alleged negligence and breach of contract. He accuses the network of \\"negligence\\" by misinforming him about its legal status and their safety in Egypt. Egyptian trial On January 29, 2014, it emerged that the Egyptian authorities were to charge 20 defendants in the case including Fahmy. On 20 February 2014, Fahmy plead not guilty and described his prison conditions as \\"psychologically unbearable.\\", Fahmy was denied bail and had his court case adjourned until 5 March 2014. On 31 March 2014, he and co-defendants Peter Greste and Baher Mohammed made a request to a judge during a hearing to be released. Fahmy received the Canadian Commission World Press Freedom Award and a certificate from the UNESCO on World Press Freedom Day dated May 3, 2014, which coincided with his appearance in court. He was allowed out of the cage to explain the nature of journalism to the judge. He reminded judge Nagy Shehata that ; \\"the world is watching\\" and asked for bail. His request was overruled after the judge wished him and his colleagues a \\"Happy Press Freedom Day\\". Fahmy addressed the court in an emotional plea on June 16 and once again denied the charges and said, \\" I wish there was a single shred of evidence so I could defend myself. And, even if there was, you would have to prove ill-intent\\". On June 23, 2014, the Cairo Criminal Court convicted the three journalists. International news organisations called the trial a farce. US Secretary of State John Kerry was highly critical of the sentences of Fahmy and his co-workers, terming them \\"chilling and draconian\\" and noted he had spoken to Egyptian governmental officials including President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. The Egyptian president, who later said that he wished the journalists had simply been deported, the following day announced that he would not interfere with the judiciary. President al-Sisi said in a speech at the Military Academy graduation ceremony that he called Minister of Justice Mahfouz Saber and told him, On 23 July 2014, the judge in the case released his reasoning for the sentence, saying the Al-Jazeera journalists were brought together \\"by the devil\\" to destabilize Egypt. Telecommunication mogul and billionaire Naguib Sawiris alleged that Fahmy has no affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood. Sawiris even took his fury further and released a video calling on president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to release Fahmy. His lawyer Amal Clooney hired on his own capacity and not through Aljazeera Media Network called the judicial process a \\"show-trial\\" in her 18 August 2014 op-ed for the Huffington Post. She released several statements, including one on 24 November 2014 calling on the Egyptians to release her client, and urged the Qatari government and Al Jazeera to take positive steps to support his freedom and refrain from actions that hinder his cause. On January 1, 2014, the highest court in Egypt upheld the sentence. On 1 February, his colleague Peter Greste was deported to Australia. The Egyptian law allowing the deportation of foreigners stipulates that they face prison or trial in their home country, but Australia is not likely to uphold Greste's conviction, no explanation was given for his release. However, Mohamed Fahmy was released on bail after spending 411 days of incarceration. He is currently banned from leaving Egypt where he continues the battle for freedom as his retrial continues in the Cairo Criminal Court and facing the possibility of returning to prison at the end of the retrial. =Retrial= The trio stood trial on 1 January 2015, before the Egyptian High Appellate court. The court ordered a retrial for Fahmy and his two colleagues, while keeping them in custody. On 2 February 2015, it was reported that he would renounce his Egyptian Citizenship so he could fit the Foreign-Pardon law and be deported to his Canada, where he is a citizen. He renounced his Egyptian citizenship on 3 February 2015. On 12 February 2015 Fahmy was released on bail of 250,000 Egyptian Pounds. Baher Mohamed was also released. The presiding judge adjourned proceedings until 23 February. On 29 August 2015, the Egyptian court sentenced Fahmy and Mohammad to three years in prison. They were found guilty of not registering with the country's Ministry of Culture, using central Cairo's Marriott hotel as a broadcasting point without permission, bringing into Egypt equipment without security officials' approval,haaretz.com: \\"UK Ambassador Summoned by Egypt Over Criticism of Sentencing of Al-Jazeera Journalists\\", 29 Aug 2015 and spreading false news.

The interference was deemed \\"incompatible with diplomatic norms and practices\\", and a spokesman \\"rejects any foreign criticism of judicial verdicts.\\" Casson said the court's decision would \\"undermine confidence in Egypt's stability\\" although it was not immediately apparent why this should be the case. In the original trial, two al-Jazeera journalists from Britain, Sue Turton and Dominic Kane, had been tried and found guilty in absentia.

Aldo Pedron was the editor-in-chief of Buscadero from its founding until 1992. It is published in the Milanese city of Gallarate. It is one of the oldest Italian music periodicals still being published, and has been called the principal source in Italy for aficionados of American music. The name is a tribute to the film of Sam Peckinpah, Junior Bonner, known in Italian as L'ultimo Buscadero. The first issue featured Bruce Springsteen. Among the writers who have appeared in the magazine over the years are Guido Chiesa, Cico Casartelli, Alfredo Marziano, Stefano Bianchi, Piero Tarantola, Marco Grompi, Adelmo Quadrio, Giancarlo Susanna and Davide Sapienza. The term \\"buscadero\\" originally meant \\"one who searches\\" and was applied to lawmen, and then later to the outlaws for whom they searched. Hollywood took it one step further and applied the term to a gunbelt and holster rig. In Italy the term came to epitomize the cowboy culture of the American West, and thus the Peckinpah film was renamed L'ultimo Buscadero for its Italian release.

She is one of the national referents of the Socialist Workers' Party (PTS), a trotskyist party member of the Workers' Left Front (FIT) for which she is a provincial deputy in C√≥rdoba Province since 10 December 2014. She previously worked as a teacher of literature.  Biography  Laura Vilches was born on 24 March 1982 in the Santa Fe Province, but has lived in C√≥rdoba since 1987. She grew up and lived as a child in the Bella Vista neighborhood. She studied highschool in the Manuel Belgrano school, where she was an activist and was several times elected as delegate of her class. In 2005, as she was studying Modern Languages in the National University of C√≥rdoba, she participated in the protests for the abolishment of the Higher Studies Law (Ley de Educaci√≥n Superior), approved years before by Carlos Menem and which N√©stor Kirchner harshened. During that time, she would come in contact with the En Clave Roja/Tesis XI (Red Key/11th Thesis) student group made up by independent activists and PTS militants. She soon became a militant in 2006; in a few years she would start her job as a teacher and would specialise in Gender studies, becoming one of the main referents of the socialist feminist group Pan y Rosas.  Provincial deputy  2011 would see the formation of the Workers' Left Front (FIT), a coalition that would bring together the main left-wing trotskyist parties nationally. In C√≥rdoba, the FIT won a seat in the provincial elections for a single district, which would rotate between the three parties of the FIT. On 10 December 2014, Vilches would enter as legislator replacing Cintia Frencia during the remaining term; her sworn in offive was accompanied by other PTS referents such as Nicol√°s del Ca√±o, Noelia Barbeito and Ra√∫l Godoy. In the 2015 elections, the FIT won 6.27% of votes and three seats, which would allow Vilches to hold a full four-year term. As legislator, she keeps her wage as a teacher and donates the rest of her salary to different worker conflicts, such as the laid-off workers of Minetti, the La Ma√±ana newspaper or the Valeo autoparts factory, as well as the worker- controlled factories MadyGraf and Zan√≥n. She has also donated money to support student and university teacher struggles demanding more budget for education. Against the salary increases of legislators, she has presented a project that forces all deputies having the same wage as a teaacher. She has requested information about femicides and presented a proposition to create an emergency provincial plan against violence towards women and establishing easy access to subsidies, housing and working and student licenses. She has protested in the Ni una menos movement in C√≥rdoba and is an activist demanding the legalisation of free abortions and integral sexual education, which allowed her to present the project for Legal, Safe and Free Abortions in 2018 in the National Congress of Argentina. Likewise, she made a judicial case against the Catholic Church in C√≥rdoba for tax evasion and demanding information in the provincial legislature on rents destined by the province governor to the Church.

It was built in 1886. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Wanda Walha was built in 1886 for successful merchant William Alexander Wilson. It was probably designed by his neighbour, the architect Arthur Morry. Originally a grocer, Wilson was also a partner in the neighbouring West End Sawmill & Steam Joinery Co Ltd. This may explain the choice of timber as the material for Wanda Walha. He also built a number of other timber houses on his five-acre (2 hectare) property, for rental. From the early 1890s he also rented Wanda Walha. In 1906 Wanda Walha became the home of Robert Scott, an accountant, who bought the house from Wilson in 1914. It remained in the Scott family until 1978 during which time it was converted into flats. During the early 1980s the house was refurbished and returned to its use as a family home.  Description  Wanda Walha is a large two-storeyed timber residence with a double-storeyed front verandah. The hipped corrugated iron roof features a projecting gable on the left side at the front. The verandah has cast iron posts and balusters. The wide decoratively notched valance on the lower level is in timber. A gabled frontispiece projects from the verandah at the centre. Sash windows with timber hoods feature along the side elevations and there is an upstairs verandah at the rear. A central hallway runs the length of the house with drawing and dining rooms, separated by cedar folding doors, on the right. A sitting room, study and a bedroom are on the left. The kitchen wing at the rear has been relocated at right angles to its original position. Upstairs are a further six bedrooms. The interior is austerely finished. Although most of the house is original, much of the verandah decoration and the central staircase were removed in the conversion to flats. These have been replaced with copies of the originals.  Heritage listing  Wanda Walha was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Wanda Walha is significant as an example of an imposing timber house built on the southside for a successful businessman. Wanda Walha is significant as a timber variation of a style usually associated with brick residences built during the 1880s boom.

She was a writer and editor for magazines, including The Crisis, the Journal of Negro Education, and Opportunity. Early life and education Esther Popel was born on July 16, 1896, to Joseph Gibbs (a mailman) and Helen King Anderson Popel in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She had an elder sister, Helen, and a younger brother, Samuel. Shaw graduated from Central High School in Harrisburg in 1915 and went on to Dickinson College in the fall. She was the first African-American woman to enroll at the college and also the first to graduate (in 1919). Popel chose to pursue what was then termed the Latin Scientific curriculum, which emphasized Latin and modern languages such as French, German, and Spanish. When she graduated she received Dickinson's top academic prize, the John Patton Memorial Prize for excellent scholarship, and she was inaugurated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. On April 11, 1925, Popel married chemist William Andrew Shaw (d. 1946); their daughter, Esther Patricia, was born on June 1, 1926. While most of her poetry was published under her maiden name, she later wrote reviews and other articles under her married name of Esther Popel Shaw. Career as poet and writer Historians recognize Popel as an activist and a poet of the Harlem Renaissance. In 1915, while a senior in high school, she self-published her first book of poetry, Thoughtless Thinks by a Thinkless Thaughter. Forty years later, she privately published an anthology of lyrical and political poems entitled A Forest Pool and dedicated it to the memory of her mother, who had recently died. Although these were her only two books, she also published poems in a number of magazines of the era and numbered among her friends and admirers such poets as Langston Hughes, Marita Bonner, and Georgia Douglas Johnson; Popel was a member of the latter's Saturday Nighters literary salon in Washington. Popel published poems in The Crisis, which was the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and in Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life, published by the National Urban League. She is listed among the prize-winning authors of the latter publication. She wrote one her most recognized poems, \\"Flag Salute,\\" in response to the highly publicized October 18, 1933 lynching of an African- American man named George Armwood on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her poem juxtaposes this historical event with quotations from the Pledge of Allegiance. In 1934, The Crisis published Popel's poem and featured it again on the cover of the November 1940 issue. A committee reporting the Board of Education in Washington found the poem \\"objectionable\\" and it was used to recommend that the District of Columbia schools disallow The Crisis. Other of her most recognizable poems include \\"Blasphemy-American Style,\\" \\"October Prayer,\\" \\"Night Comes Walking,\\" and \\"Little Gray Leaves.\\" Five of her poems were republished in the Beltway Poetry Quarterly in 2013. Popel Shaw served on the editorial board for the Negro History Bulletin, which was a publication of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History established by the historian Carter G. Woodson. When Woodson died in 1950, Popel Shaw was named among the individuals who would carry on his legacy. In addition to her contribution to the Bulletin, Popel Shaw regularly published book reviews in the Journal of Negro History and the Journal of Negro Education. In her writings in these publications she voiced her opinions about race relations in the United States. She also wrote a half dozen plays for high school students. Teaching career and activism In order to support herself, Popel Shaw taught junior high school classes in French, English, algebra, and penmanship. Her teaching career spanned four decades beginning with brief early positions at Douglass Junior High School in Baltimore and Shaw Junior High School in Washington, DC. Her longest-running job was at Francis Junior High in Washington, DC, where she taught from the late 1920s until her retirement in 1952. Popel Shaw was active throughout her life in African-American and women's rights organizations. In the early 1920s she was a member of the College Alumnae Club, an organization of college-educated African-American women activists who supported education, especially for African-American girls. She served as vice-president and president during her involvement with the club. In 1923, the club became the National Association of College Women (NACW), and as a charter member Popel Shaw was appointed chair of the committee on the constitution. She went on to serve as secretary of the NACW's executive board for 19 years, during which period she also functioned as the organization's chief spokeswoman. In 1933, Popel Shaw represented NACW when the Women's International League of Peace and Freedom presented disarmament petitions to President Roosevelt in the White House. In 1942 she became the NACW's wartime liaison to the Washington Department of the Office of Price Administration. Other positions that Popel Shaw held included serving on Delta Sigma Theta vigilance committee. Delta was an organization that Popel had been extremely active with; dating back to 1922 when she and four other women chartered the Epsilon Sigma Chapter, now known as Baltimore Alumnae chapter. Her only daughter Patricia was also involved with the sorority, joining Delta while enrolled at Howard University. Popel served as a consultant to the Educational Policies Commission and a board member of the Southeast Settlement House for African-Americans. As part of her work with the commission, she was appointed by the National Education Association and the Department of Superintendence to develop long-range plans to improve education in the United States. In 1952, a heart condition forced Popel Shaw to retire from teaching. In her retirement she took up painting as a hobby. On January 28, 1958, she died of a stroke and was buried in the Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Washington, DC.

The embolization therapy can reduce the size of the tumor, and decrease the tumor's impact such its hormone production, effectively decreasing symptoms. The treatment was initially developed in the early 1970s. The several types of hepatic artery treatments are based on the observation that tumor cells get nearly all their nutrients from the hepatic artery, while the normal cells of the liver get about 70-80 percent of their nutrients and 50% their oxygen supply from the portal vein, and thus can survive with the hepatic artery effectively blocked. In practice, hepatic artery embolization occludes the blood flow to the tumors, achieving significant tumor shrinkage in over 80% of people. Shrinkage rates vary. Background The several types of hepatic artery treatments are based on the observation that tumor cells get nearly all their nutrients from the hepatic artery, while the normal cells of the liver get about 70-80 percent of their nutrients and 50% their oxygen supply from the portal vein, and thus can survive with the hepatic artery effectively blocked. In practice, hepatic artery embolization is an option if the neoplastic growth is mainly within the liver. By occluding the blood supply to the tumors, achieving significant tumor shrinkage in over 80% of people. Shrinkage rates vary. The therapy can effectively decrease symptoms by reducing the size of the tumor, or by decreasing the tumor's impact, for example by decreasing the tumor's production of hormones. Primary liver tumors, metastatic neuroendocrine tumors to the liver and other metastases to the liver may be considered for therapy directed via the hepatic artery. Method The percutaneous Seldinger technique introduces a catheter, which is a thin flexible tube made of medical grade material, into the hepatic artery under radiological control. This approach was developed for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors in the early 1970s. Tumor cells get over 90% of their nutrients from the hepatic artery, while the normal cells of the liver get about 70-80 percent of their nutrients and 50% their oxygen supply from the portal vein, and thus can survive with the hepatic artery effectively blocked. Once the catheter is carefully placed in the artery or in a selected branch, the blood flow can be occluded by injecting various items, such as plastic particles, glue, metal coils, foam, or by deploying a balloon. Additional considerations and procedural details have been reviewed. Related methods In hepatic artery chemotherapy (HAC), chemotherapy agents are given into the hepatic artery, often by steady infusion over hours or even days. Compared with systemic chemotherapy, a higher proportion of the chemotherapy agents is (in theory) delivered to the lesions in the liver. Hepatic artery chemoembolization (HACE), sometimes called transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), combines hepatic artery embolization with hepatic artery chemo infusion. In one method, embospheres bound with chemotherapy agents injected into the hepatic artery, lodge in downstream capillaries.

It has been proposed from Michael Kearns, Yishay Mansour, Dana Ron, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Robert Schapire and Linda Sellie in 1994 M. Kearns, Y. Mansour, D. Ron, R. Rubinfeld, R. Schapire, L. Sellie On the Learnability of Discrete Distributions. ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1994 and it was inspired from the PAC- framework introduced by Leslie Valiant.L. Valiant A theory of the learnable. Communications of ACM, 1984 In this framework the input is a number of samples drawn from a distribution that belongs to a specific class of distributions. The goal is to find an efficient algorithm that, based on these samples, determines with high probability the distribution from which the samples have been drawn. Because of its generality, this framework has been used in a large variety of different fields like machine learning, approximation algorithms, applied probability and statistics. This article explains the basic definitions, tools and results in this framework from the theory of computation point of view. Definitions Let \\\\textstyle X be the support of the distributions of interest. As in the original work of Kearns et al. if \\\\textstyle X is finite it can be assumed without loss of generality that \\\\textstyle X = \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}^n where \\\\textstyle n is the number of bits that have to be used in order to represent any \\\\textstyle y \\\\in X. We focus in probability distributions over \\\\textstyle X. There are two possible representations of a probability distribution \\\\textstyle D over \\\\textstyle X. * probability distribution function (or evaluator) an evaluator \\\\textstyle E_D for \\\\textstyle D takes as input any \\\\textstyle y \\\\in X and outputs a real number \\\\textstyle E_D[y] which denotes the probability that of \\\\textstyle y according to \\\\textstyle D, i.e. \\\\textstyle E_D[y] = \\\\Pr [Y = y] if \\\\textstyle Y \\\\sim D. * generator a generator \\\\textstyle G_D for \\\\textstyle D takes as input a string of truly random bits \\\\textstyle y and outputs \\\\textstyle G_D[y] \\\\in X according to the distribution \\\\textstyle D. Generator can be interpreted as a routine that simulates sampling from the distribution \\\\textstyle D given a sequence of fair coin tosses. A distribution \\\\textstyle D is called to have a polynomial generator (respectively evaluator) if its generator (respectively evaluator) exists and can be computed in polynomial time. Let \\\\textstyle C_X a class of distribution over X, that is \\\\textstyle C_X is a set such that every \\\\textstyle D \\\\in C_X is a probability distribution with support \\\\textstyle X. The \\\\textstyle C_X can also be written as \\\\textstyle C for simplicity. Before defining learnability its necessary to define good approximations of a distribution \\\\textstyle D. There are several ways to measure the distance between two distribution. The three more common possibilities are * Kullback- Leibler divergence * Total variation distance of probability measures * Kolmogorov distance The strongest of these distances is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the weakest is the Kolmogorov distance. This means that for any pair of distributions \\\\textstyle D, \\\\textstyle D' : : KL-distance(D, D') \\\\ge TV-distance(D, D') \\\\ge Kolmogorov-distance(D, D') Therefore, for example if \\\\textstyle D and \\\\textstyle D' are close with respect to Kullback-Leibler divergence then they are also close with respect to all the other distances. Next definitions hold for all the distances and therefore the symbol \\\\textstyle d(D, D') denotes the distance between the distribution \\\\textstyle D and the distribution \\\\textstyle D' using one of the distances that we describe above. Although learnability of a class of distributions can be defined using any of these distances, applications refer to a specific distance. The basic input that we use in order to learn a distribution is a number of samples drawn by this distribution. For the computational point of view the assumption is that such a sample is given in a constant amount of time. So it's like having access to an oracle \\\\textstyle GEN(D) that returns a sample from the distribution \\\\textstyle D. Sometimes the interest is, apart from measuring the time complexity, to measure the number of samples that have to be used in order to learn a specific distribution \\\\textstyle D in class of distributions \\\\textstyle C. This quantity is called sample complexity of the learning algorithm. In order for the problem of distribution learning to be more clear consider the problem of supervised learning as defined in.Lorenzo Rosasco, Tomaso Poggio, \\"A Regularization Tour of Machine Learning ‚Äî MIT-9.520 Lectures Notes\\" Manuscript, Dec. 2014 In this framework of statistical learning theory a training set \\\\textstyle S = \\\\\\\\{(x_1, y_1), \\\\dots, (x_n, y_n) \\\\\\\\} and the goal is to find a target function \\\\textstyle f : X \\\\rightarrow Y that minimizes some loss function, e.g. the square loss function. More formally f = \\\\arg \\\\min_{g} \\\\int V(y, g(x)) d\\\\rho(x, y), where V(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) is the loss function, e.g. V(y, z) = (y - z)^2 and \\\\rho(x, y) the probability distribution according to which the elements of the training set are sampled. If the conditional probability distribution \\\\rho_x(y) is known then the target function has the closed form f(x) = \\\\int_y y d\\\\rho_x(y). So the set S is a set of samples from the probability distribution \\\\rho(x, y). Now the goal of distributional learning theory if to find \\\\rho given S which can be used to find the target function f. Definition of learnability A class of distributions \\\\textstyle C is called efficiently learnable if for every \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon > 0 and \\\\textstyle 0 < \\\\delta \\\\le 1 given access to \\\\textstyle GEN(D) for an unknown distribution \\\\textstyle D \\\\in C, there exists a polynomial time algorithm \\\\textstyle A, called learning algorithm of \\\\textstyle C, that outputs a generator or an evaluator of a distribution \\\\textstyle D' such that : \\\\Pr[ d(D, D') \\\\le \\\\epsilon ] \\\\ge 1 - \\\\delta If we know that \\\\textstyle D' \\\\in C then \\\\textstyle A is called proper learning algorithm, otherwise is called improper learning algorithm. In some settings the class of distributions \\\\textstyle C is a class with well known distributions which can be described by a set of parameters. For instance \\\\textstyle C could be the class of all the Gaussian distributions \\\\textstyle N(\\\\mu, \\\\sigma^2). In this case the algorithm \\\\textstyle A should be able to estimate the parameters \\\\textstyle \\\\mu, \\\\sigma. In this case \\\\textstyle A is called parameter learning algorithm. Obviously the parameter learning for simple distributions is a very well studied field that is called statistical estimation and there is a very long bibliography on different estimators for different kinds of simple known distributions. But distributions learning theory deals with learning class of distributions that have more complicated description. First results In their seminal work, Kearns et al. deal with the case where \\\\textstyle A is described in term of a finite polynomial sized circuit and they proved the following for some specific classes of distribution. * \\\\textstyle OR gate distributions for this kind of distributions there is no polynomial-sized evaluator, unless \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\#P \\\\subseteq P/\\\\text{poly}. On the other hand, this class is efficiently learnable with generator. * Parity gate distributions this class is efficiently learnable with both generator and evaluator. * Mixtures of Hamming Balls this class is efficiently learnable with both generator and evaluator. * Probabilistic Finite Automata this class is not efficiently learnable with evaluator under the Noisy Parity Assumption which is an impossibility assumption in the PAC learning framework. \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon-Covers One very common technique in order to find a learning algorithm for a class of distributions \\\\textstyle C is to first find a small \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon-cover of \\\\textstyle C. Definition A set \\\\textstyle C_{\\\\epsilon} is called \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon-cover of \\\\textstyle C if for every \\\\textstyle D \\\\in C there is a \\\\textstyle D' \\\\in C_{\\\\epsilon} such that \\\\textstyle d(D, D') \\\\le \\\\epsilon. An \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon- cover is small if it has polynomial size with respect to the parameters that describe \\\\textstyle D. Once there is an efficient procedure that for every \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon > 0 finds a small \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon-cover \\\\textstyle C_{\\\\epsilon} of C then the only left task is to select from \\\\textstyle C_{\\\\epsilon} the distribution \\\\textstyle D' \\\\in C_{\\\\epsilon} that is closer to the distribution \\\\textstyle D \\\\in C that has to be learned. The problem is that given \\\\textstyle D', D \\\\in C_{\\\\epsilon} it is not trivial how we can compare \\\\textstyle d(D, D') and \\\\textstyle d(D, D) in order to decide which one is the closest to \\\\textstyle D, because \\\\textstyle D is unknown. Therefore, the samples from \\\\textstyle D have to be used to do these comparisons. Obviously the result of the comparison always has a probability of error. So the task is similar with finding the minimum in a set of element using noisy comparisons. There are a lot of classical algorithms in order to achieve this goal. The most recent one which achieves the best guarantees was proposed by Daskalakis and Kamath C. Daskalakis, G. Kamath Faster and Sample Near-Optimal Algorithms for Proper Learning Mixtures of Gaussians. Annual Conference on Learning Theory, 2014 This algorithm sets up a fast tournament between the elements of \\\\textstyle C_{\\\\epsilon} where the winner \\\\textstyle D^* of this tournament is the element which is \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon-close to \\\\textstyle D (i.e. \\\\textstyle d(D^*, D) \\\\le \\\\epsilon) with probability at least \\\\textstyle 1 - \\\\delta. In order to do so their algorithm uses \\\\textstyle O(\\\\log N / \\\\epsilon^2) samples from \\\\textstyle D and runs in \\\\textstyle O(N \\\\log N / \\\\epsilon^2) time, where \\\\textstyle N = C_{\\\\epsilon}. Learning sums of random variables Learning of simple well known distributions is a well studied field and there are a lot of estimators that can be used. One more complicated class of distributions is the distribution of a sum of variables that follow simple distributions. These learning procedure have a close relation with limit theorems like the central limit theorem because they tend to examine the same object when the sum tends to an infinite sum. Recently there are two results that described here include the learning Poisson binomial distributions and learning sums of independent integer random variables. All the results below hold using the total variation distance as a distance measure. =Learning Poisson binomial distributions= Consider \\\\textstyle n independent Bernoulli random variables \\\\textstyle X_1, \\\\dots, X_n with probabilities of success \\\\textstyle p_1, \\\\dots, p_n. A Poisson Binomial Distribution of order \\\\textstyle n is the distribution of the sum \\\\textstyle X = \\\\sum_i X_i. For learning the class \\\\textstyle PBD = \\\\\\\\{ D : D ~ \\\\text{ is a Poisson binomial distribution} \\\\\\\\}. The first of the following results deals with the case of improper learning of \\\\textstyle PBD and the second with the proper learning of \\\\textstyle PBD. C. Daskalakis, I. Diakonikolas, R. Servedio Learning Poisson Binomial Distributions. ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2012 Theorem Let \\\\textstyle D \\\\in PBD then there is an algorithm which given \\\\textstyle n, \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon > 0, \\\\textstyle 0 < \\\\delta \\\\le 1 and access to \\\\textstyle GEN(D) finds a \\\\textstyle D' such that \\\\textstyle \\\\Pr[ d(D, D') \\\\le \\\\epsilon ] \\\\ge 1 - \\\\delta. The sample complexity of this algorithm is \\\\textstyle \\\\tilde{O}( ( 1 / \\\\epsilon^3 ) \\\\log (1 / \\\\delta) ) and the running time is \\\\textstyle \\\\tilde{O}( (1 / \\\\epsilon^3) \\\\log n \\\\log^2 (1 / \\\\delta) ). Theorem Let \\\\textstyle D \\\\in PBD then there is an algorithm which given \\\\textstyle n, \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon > 0, \\\\textstyle 0 < \\\\delta \\\\le 1 and access to \\\\textstyle GEN(D) finds a \\\\textstyle D' \\\\in PBD such that \\\\textstyle \\\\Pr[ d(D, D') \\\\le \\\\epsilon ] \\\\ge 1 - \\\\delta. The sample complexity of this algorithm is \\\\textstyle \\\\tilde{O}( ( 1 / \\\\epsilon^2 ) ) \\\\log (1 / \\\\delta) and the running time is \\\\textstyle (1 / \\\\epsilon)^{O(\\\\log^2 (1 / \\\\epsilon))} \\\\tilde{O}( \\\\log n \\\\log (1 / \\\\delta) ). One part of the above results is that the sample complexity of the learning algorithm doesn't depend on \\\\textstyle n, although the description of \\\\textstyle D is linear in \\\\textstyle n. Also the second result is almost optimal with respect to the sample complexity because there is also a lower bound of \\\\textstyle O(1 / \\\\epsilon^2). The proof uses a small \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon-cover of \\\\textstyle PBD that has been produced by Daskalakis and Papadimitriou,C. Daskalakis, C. Papadimitriou Sparse Covers for Sums of Indicators. Probability Theory and Related Fields, 2014 in order to get this algorithm. =Learning Sums of Independent Integer Random Variables= Consider \\\\textstyle n independent random variables \\\\textstyle X_1, \\\\dots, X_n each of which follows an arbitrary distribution with support \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\{0, 1, \\\\dots, k - 1\\\\\\\\}. A \\\\textstyle k-sum of independent integer random variable of order \\\\textstyle n is the distribution of the sum \\\\textstyle X = \\\\sum_i X_i. For learning the class \\\\textstyle k-SIIRV = \\\\\\\\{ D : D \\\\text{is a k-sum of independent integer random variable } \\\\\\\\} there is the following result Theorem Let \\\\textstyle D \\\\in k-SIIRV then there is an algorithm which given \\\\textstyle n, \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon > 0 and access to \\\\textstyle GEN(D) finds a \\\\textstyle D' such that \\\\textstyle \\\\Pr[ d(D, D') \\\\le \\\\epsilon ] \\\\ge 1 - \\\\delta. The sample complexity of this algorithm is \\\\textstyle \\\\text{poly}(k / \\\\epsilon) and the running time is also \\\\textstyle \\\\text{poly}(k / \\\\epsilon). Another part is that the sample and the time complexity does not depend on \\\\textstyle n. Its possible to conclude this independence for the previous section if we set \\\\textstyle k = 2.C. Daskalakis, I. Diakonikolas, R. O‚ÄôDonnell, R. Servedio, L. Tan Learning Sums of Independent Integer Random Variables. IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2013 Learning mixtures of Gaussians Let the random variables \\\\textstyle X \\\\sim N(\\\\mu_1, \\\\Sigma_1) and \\\\textstyle Y \\\\sim N(\\\\mu_2, \\\\Sigma_2). Define the random variable \\\\textstyle Z which takes the same value as \\\\textstyle X with probability \\\\textstyle w_1 and the same value as \\\\textstyle Y with probability \\\\textstyle w_2 = 1 - w_1. Then if \\\\textstyle F_1 is the density of \\\\textstyle X and \\\\textstyle F_2 is the density of \\\\textstyle Y the density of \\\\textstyle Z is \\\\textstyle F = w_1 F_1 + w_2 F_2. In this case \\\\textstyle Z is said to follow a mixture of Gaussians. Pearson K. Pearson Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Evolution. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in London, 1894 was the first who introduced the notion of the mixtures of Gaussians in his attempt to explain the probability distribution from which he got same data that he wanted to analyze. So after doing a lot of calculations by hand, he finally fitted his data to a mixture of Gaussians. The learning task in this case is to determine the parameters of the mixture \\\\textstyle w_1, w_2, \\\\mu_1, \\\\mu_2, \\\\Sigma_1, \\\\Sigma_2. The first attempt to solve this problem was from Dasgupta.S. Dasgupta Learning Mixtures of Gaussians. IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1999 In this work Dasgupta assumes that the two means of the Gaussians are far enough from each other. This means that there is a lower bound on the distance \\\\textstyle \\\\mu_1 - \\\\mu_2. Using this assumption Dasgupta and a lot of scientists after him were able to learn the parameters of the mixture. The learning procedure starts with clustering the samples into two different clusters minimizing some metric. Using the assumption that the means of the Gaussians are far away from each other with high probability the samples in the first cluster correspond to samples from the first Gaussian and the samples in the second cluster to samples from the second one. Now that the samples are partitioned the \\\\textstyle \\\\mu_i, \\\\Sigma_i can be computed from simple statistical estimators and \\\\textstyle w_i by comparing the magnitude of the clusters. If \\\\textstyle GM is the set of all the mixtures of two Gaussians, using the above procedure theorems like the following can be proved. Theorem Let \\\\textstyle D \\\\in GM with \\\\textstyle \\\\mu_1 - \\\\mu_2 \\\\ge c \\\\sqrt{n \\\\max (\\\\lambda_{max}(\\\\Sigma_1), \\\\lambda_{max}(\\\\Sigma_2))}, where \\\\textstyle c > 1/2 and \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda_{max}(A) the largest eigenvalue of \\\\textstyle A, then there is an algorithm which given \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon > 0, \\\\textstyle 0 < \\\\delta \\\\le 1 and access to \\\\textstyle GEN(D) finds an approximation \\\\textstyle w'_i, \\\\mu'_i, \\\\Sigma'_i of the parameters such that \\\\textstyle \\\\Pr[ w_i - w'_i \\\\le \\\\epsilon ] \\\\ge 1 - \\\\delta (respectively for \\\\textstyle \\\\mu_i and \\\\textstyle \\\\Sigma_i. The sample complexity of this algorithm is \\\\textstyle M = 2^{O(\\\\log^2 ( 1 / ( \\\\epsilon \\\\delta ) ))} and the running time is \\\\textstyle O(M^2 d + M d n). The above result could also be generalized in \\\\textstyle k-mixture of Gaussians. For the case of mixture of two Gaussians there are learning results without the assumption of the distance between their means, like the following one which uses the total variation distance as a distance measure. Theorem Let \\\\textstyle F \\\\in GM then there is an algorithm which given \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon > 0, \\\\textstyle 0 < \\\\delta \\\\le 1 and access to \\\\textstyle GEN(D) finds \\\\textstyle w'_i, \\\\mu'_i, \\\\Sigma'_i such that if \\\\textstyle F' = w'_1 F'_1 + w'_2 F'_2, where \\\\textstyle F'_i = N(\\\\mu'_i, \\\\Sigma'_i) then \\\\textstyle \\\\Pr[ d(F, F') \\\\le \\\\epsilon ] \\\\ge 1 - \\\\delta. The sample complexity and the running time of this algorithm is \\\\textstyle \\\\text{poly}(n, 1 / \\\\epsilon, 1 / \\\\delta, 1 / w_1, 1 / w_2, 1 / d(F_1, F_2)). The distance between \\\\textstyle F_1 and \\\\textstyle F_2 doesn't affect the quality of the result of the algorithm but just the sample complexity and the running time.A. Kalai, A. Moitra, G.

It is administered by Health Canada and covers benefit claims for certain drugs, dental care, vision care, medical supplies and equipment, short-term crisis intervention mental health counselling, and medical transportation. In Canada, provinces and territories deliver health care services, which can be accessed by First Nations people and Inuit. The NIHB program provides health-related goods and services not insured by provinces and territories or other private insurance plans. Health care providers must submit cases to Health Canada for review to access all vision care, transportation, and counselling, most dental, medical supplies and equipment benefits, and for some drug benefits. Coverage of Benefits Benefits are considered for coverage when: *listed on an NIHB benefit list or schedule *intended for home or other ambulatory care settings *prior approval or predetermination is obtained (if required) *unavailable through other health or social programs *prescribed by a licensed health professional *provided by a recognized provider. Eligibility Non- insured health benefits are available for eligible First Nations people and Inuit in Canada, as well as infants under one year whose parent is eligible. =Inuit= Inuit must be Canadian residents and must be beneficiaries of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or beneficiaries of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. Inuit living in Nunavut or the Northwest Territories are automatically registered for the program when they receive their territorial health care card. If they live outside the land claim settlement area they must register with the land claim organization and provide documentation to the government to receive an 'N' number, a personal identification number. =First Nations= First Nations people must be Canadian residents and a registered Indian according to the Indian Act in order to access NIHB programs. Controversy Health Canada asserts the program exists to support First Nations people and Inuit in reaching an overall health status that is comparable with other Canadians. Many First Nations groups assert that health benefits are an inherent Aboriginal and treaty right and are constitutionally protected. Only Treaty 6 specifically mentions health care, which includes a clause for a medicine chest to be held at the Indian agent's home and a clause for emergency help. Other treaty negotiations included a discussion about medical services, and doctors were often in attendance when treaty annuities were paid out. The medicine chest clause and historical documentation of treaty discussions have been interpreted by First Nations groups to signal a responsibility for the government to provide ongoing healthcare. From the government of Canada's perspective, there were no statutory or treaty obligations for providing health care to indigenous people, though health services would be provided when medically necessary. Though they recognized that medical care had been written into Treaty 6, the government provided health services on humanitarian rather than on legal grounds. Drug Benefit List The Drug Benefit List (DBL) is a list of drugs that are covered by the NIHB program. Updates are issued quarterly and drugs are frequently added or removed from the list. The DBL also provides a tool for doctors and pharmacists to encourage the use of generic drugs.

She is also one of the designers of the Australian flag. Early life On 19 March 1866, Annie Whistler was born at Litchfield Ashe, near Southampton, England. She was the second of nine children of Richard Whistler and his wife Sarah Mills (n√©e Vines); she had six sisters and two brothers. Richard was a tenant farmer on the Foliejon Estate and farm in Winkfield, Berkshire; the family claimed to be related to the artist James McNeill Whistler, but this has not been proven.Erickson, Dorothy. \\"Annie Dorrington (1866-1926)\\". Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, 2005. The farm adjoined Windsor Great Park, and Annie and her sisters sometimes saw Queen Victoria being driven through the park.Kennedy, Philip. \\"The Annie Dorrington Story\\" . One Nation website. Annie began painting in childhood and she and her sisters enjoyed painting scenes on the banks of the Thames River.\\"Annie Whistler Dorrington\\" . Australian Flag Association website. Richard Whistler died in 1887 and a bailiff named Charles Dorrington, who later became Annie's husband, came to manage the farm. When the Whistler sisters asked their mother the name of their prospective bailiff, she replied, \\"It could be Ahasuerus for all I know!\\" As a result, Charles Dorrington was known by the nickname 'Asu' from then on, and Annie would use 'Ahasuerus' as a pseudonym when she later entered Australia's national flag competition (see below). Several years after Richard's death, Sarah emigrated to Melbourne, Victoria, with all nine of her children. Charles Dorrington accompanied them, and in 1892 Charles and Annie were married in St. Alban's Church of England in Armadale, a suburb of Melbourne. Sarah had not wanted Annie to marry Dorrington and cut her off entirely as a result. Many years later, Annie's niece Kath Dowsing would recall that her name was never mentioned in the family.\\"Australian Wildflowers and Flags\\". Whistler Family Sketches website. In 1895, Annie and Charles moved to Western Australia; they lived at Fremantle in 1897 before they moved to Perth in 1898. Charles worked for the Swan River Shipping Company in Perth until 1914, after which he became a shire clerk at Mundijong. The Dorringtons had no children. Art career It was after the Dorringtons moved to Perth that Annie became known as a painter who specialized in watercolours of Western Australian wildflowers. Her botanical paintings are for the most part moderately detailed and realistic, with some subjects painted in a more impressionistic style and with more vivid colours.Gooding, Janda. Wildflowers in Art: Artists' Impressions of Western Australian Wildflowers, 1699-1991. Art Gallery of Western Australia, 1991. The subjects are often sprays of flowers with their leaves, isolated against a plain background. Typical of the plants she chose to depict are Orthrosanthus laxus (a small flower commonly known as morning iris), Chamelaucium aorocladus (known as waxflower), and kangaroo paw. She gave some of her paintings to a friend, Alice Moore, who picked specimen flowers for her in Kings Park. By 1901, Annie was exhibiting widely, with watercolours in the Western Australian pavilion at the 1900 Paris International Exhibition, the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition, the 1904 St. Louis International Exposition, and the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition, London. The London show included no less than 50 of her paintings. She offered to sell some of them to Bernard Woodward, director of the Western Australian Museum and Art Gallery, but without success. To help support herself, Annie taught private painting classes at home from 1902 to 1906, advertising them in the local newspaper.\\"News and Notes\\". The West Australian, February 9, 1898. In 1901, using the pseudonym 'Ahasuerus', Annie entered the 1901 Federal Flag Design Competition to design a flag for Australia; hers was one of over 30,000 entries. She was the first named and only woman among the five entrants who submitted similar designs, all of which featured the constellation of the Southern Cross. She split a prize of ¬£200 with the other four other winners: Ivor Evans (a schoolboy), Leslie John Hawkins (an apprentice optician), Egbert John Nuttall (an architect), and William Stevens (a ship's officer). Suffering from depression, Annie had treatments at Claremont Mental Hospital for a few months in 1908 and again in 1918. In 1914, she and her husband moved to Serpentine, where Charles became a farmer and fruit grower. Annie died there of cancer in 1926 at the age of 60 and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery in an unmarked grave. Charles died nine years later, in 1935, and the following year 124 of Annie's paintings were donated to the Art Gallery of Western Australia. In 1991, her paintings were featured in a survey exhibition mounted by the gallery and subsequently reproduced in the resulting show catalogue. In 1999, in honor of her contributions to Australian culture, a new monument to Annie Dorrington was erected at the cemetery.

They were composed in October 1913 and published the following year. Two additional sets were published posthumously. Description Many of Satie's contemporaries spoke of his essentially childlike nature.Composer Robert Caby, an associate of Satie's last years, said: \\"His was a unique personality. He was something else: a child of genius, with the candor and purity one finds in a child.\\" Robert Caby, interview with Robert Orledge on September 13, 1986. Cited in Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber Ltd., London, 1995.In a 1922 letter, Dada artist Francis Picabia called Satie \\"truly a sad child, whom alcohol sometimes renders optimistic.\\" Quoted in Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 517.Satie addressed his own aging with a characteristic blend of irony and conviction. In a 1922 lecture he referred to his Premier Menuet (1920) as \\"written when I was still quite young - 54 years old.\\" See http://www.musicalobservations.com/publications/satie.html. Paul Zukofsky, \\"Satie Notes\\" (2011), revised text of program notes for the 1991 Summergarden Concert Series of the Museum of Modern Art, New York City. He identified with children, and his respect for their innocence and naivet√© has been related to his own quest for purity and directness in music.http://www.allmusic.com/composition/menus-propos-enfantins-childish- chatter-for-piano-from-quot-enfantines-quot--mc0002361546 Alexander Carpenter Allmusic review. From 1908 to 1910 he ran a charity group in his hometown of Arcueil to take orphans and poorer boys and girls on country outings; and on Sunday mornings he gave them solf√®ge lessons and improvised melodies with funny titles to make them laugh.Michel Robillard, \\"Erik Satie in Arcueil\\", Paris, 1990. Quoted by Olof H√∂jer in his notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5\\", p. 22, Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. This side of Satie found its most direct creative expression in the Enfantines, music his first biographer Pierre-Daniel Templier described as not \\"about children, or for children, but of a child.\\"Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, p. 85. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932. These are genuine children's pieces, crafted for small hands,Anne Rey, \\"Erik Satie\\", Seghers, Paris, 1974, Collection Musiciens de Tous les Temps. Quoted by H√∂jer, \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5\\". with simple themes that can be easily learned. Each set is built on a different five-finger scale, using only the white keys of the piano. Menus propos enfantins serves as a sort of introduction. There is greater rhythmic variety in the Enfantillages pittoresques while the Peccadilles importunes have more dissonant harmonies and varied tempi. Thus, according to pianist Olof H√∂jer, \\"the music is gradually more advanced and the degree of technical difficulty increases.\\"H√∂jer, \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5\\". As with his humoristic piano suites of the period (1912-1915), Satie's eccentric wit is evident in the titles and playful narratives appended to the Enfantines. He avoids didacticism in order to give his young pupils \\"the freedom to engage in the music through play...Satie hoped to have children learn without knowing they were doing so. Indeed, these pieces were designed ‚Äî visually, musically, textually, and physically ‚Äî with the delight of the child in mind.\\"Dr. Julianne Lindberg, abstract of lecture \\"Pedagogy, Play, and 'the pianist's reward': Erik Satie's Piano Albums for Children\\", delivered at University of California, Santa Barbara, January 16, 2010. http://www.music.ucsb.edu/projects/musicwrittenword/panel20th.html Satie never lost his devotion to young people and the promise of the future they represented. This later manifested itself in his support of the budding composers who made up Les Six and the \\"Arcueil School\\". Towards the end of his life he told Darius Milhaud, \\"I should so much like to know what kind of music the children who are now four years old will write.\\"Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 100. Original Enfantines Title page of the first edition (1914) of Satie's Enfantines =Menus propos enfantins (Childish Small Talk)= :1. Le chant guerrier du roi des haricots ::(The Warrior Song of the King of Beans) :2. Ce que dit la petite princesse des tulipes ::(What the Little Princess of Tulips Said) :3. Valse du chocolat aux amandes ::(Chocolate Waltz with Almonds) Dated October 10, 1913, and dedicated to Valentine Gross. The pieces are marked Mouvt. de Marche (march tempo), Tr√®s lent (very slowly), and Valse (Waltz). Satie's texts for movements 1 and 2 deal with imaginary royalty. First we are offered a sketch of the jolly King of Beans and his brave horse, who likes dancing, war and bullets. The Little Tulip Princess speaks softly because her doll has a headache, having fallen from the third floor (\\"The doctor says it's nothing\\"). The third story is a dialogue between a mother and her young son. The \\"greedy\\" boy thinks he finds a bone in his chocolate (\\"No, my little one, it's an almond\\") and throws a tantrum when he's not allowed to eat the whole box.English summary of original French text at IMSLP http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/a/a0/IMSLP198846-SIBLEY1802.20118.3f8c-39087012833465score.pdf =Enfantillages pittoresques (Picturesque Child's Play)= :1. Petit pr√©lude √† la journ√©e ::(Little Prelude to the Day) :2. Berceuse ::(Lullaby) :3. Marche du grand escalier ::(March of the Grand Staircase) Dated October 22, 1913, and dedicated to Madame Leon Verveuil. The first two pieces are marked Mod√©r√© (moderately) and Lent (slow); the Marche is in standard time. The annotations for the Petit pr√©lude are a matter-of-fact itinerary that Satie certainly followed himself (\\"Wake up...Brush your hair well...Go for a good walk\\"),Satie hid his poverty by keeping an immaculately-groomed personal appearance, and his long daily walks from Arcueil to Paris were well known. See Robert Orledge, \\"Satie's Musical and Personal Logic\\", transcript of lecture at Gresham College, April 16, 2010.http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and- events/erik-satie-part-one-saties-musical-and-personal-logic-and-satie-as-poet while in the Berceuse little Pierrot is tucked in for the night by his mother. She assures him his grandparents will know he was a good boy - they'll see it in the newspaper. In the Marche a king has built a 1000-step ivory staircase so beautiful that people are afraid to use it. The king himself leaves his room by jumping out the window. He is so fond of the staircase he wants to have it stuffed.English summary of original French text at IMSLP http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/3/3c/IMSLP08117-Enfantillages.pdf =Peccadilles importunes (Tiresome Pranks)= :1. Etre jaloux de son camarade qui a une grosse t√™te ::(Being jealous of a friend who has a big head) :2. Lui manger sa tartine ::(Eating up his bread and jam) :3. Profiter de ce qu'il a des cors aux pieds pour lui prendre son cerceau ::(Taking advantage of his corns to steal his hoop) Dated October 26, 1913, and dedicated to Marguerite Long. The pieces are marked Andante (moderately slow), Lent, and Un peu vif (a little lively). For this set Satie's texts assume a faux-moralizing tone, with admonitions such as \\"Those who are jealous are unhappy,\\" \\"The Good Lord will be angry if he sees this,\\" and \\"Never do this unless someone tells you to.\\" The commentator of Lui manger sa tartine remarks on the temptations of stealing someone else's bread and jam, then mentions that his dog secretly smoked all his cigars and got a bellyache from them.English summary of original French text at IMSLP http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/e/e9/IMSLP08131-Peccadilles.pdf Posthumous Enfantines =Trois Nouvelles Enfantines (Three New Enfantines)= :1. Le vilain petit vaurien ::(The Ugly Little Rascal) :2. Berceuse ::(Lullaby) :3. La gentille toute petite fille ::(The Nice Little Girl) These pieces were composed in early October 1913. Satie's notebooks show the care and self-critical attitude he devoted to his children's music, with material ranging from possible fingering trials to neat copies of pieces he ultimately rejected.Robert Orledge, \\"Appendix: Chronological Catalogue of Satie's Compositions and Research Guide to the Manuscripts\\", published in Dr. Caroline Potter (ed.), \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\", Ashgate Publishing, LTD, 2013, pp. 243-324. Musicologist Nigel Wilkins edited three of the latter and published them as Trois Nouvelles Enfantines in 1972. Olof H√∂jer felt the first two in particular have \\"a flavor of two-part, chromatic inventions\\" and speculated they may have derived from unused material of Satie's early Schola Cantorum period (1905-1908).H√∂jer, \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5\\". =L‚ÄôEnfance de Ko-Quo (Ko-Quo‚Äôs Childhood)= :1. Ne bois pas ton chocolat avec tes doigts ::(Don't drink chocolate with your fingers) :2. Ne souffle pas dans tes oreilles ::(Don't blow in your ears) :3. Ne mets pas ta t√™te sous ton bras ::(Don‚Äôt put your head under your arm) Subtitled Recommendations maternelles (Motherly Advice) and dated September 27‚Äì28, 1913, L‚ÄôEnfance de Ko-Quo was the first projected set of Enfantines Satie completed.Orledge, The Frogweb. He never published it, possibly because he felt it was too sophisticated for children. It covers a wider keyboard range, including the black keys.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRTcJh-jyfo Ornella Volta discovered the manuscript in a private collection and published the texts in her edition of Satie's literary writings A Mammal's Notebook (1996, reprinted 2014); she edited the score for publication in 1999. Volta suggested that the unique name \\"Ko-Quo\\" may be a childish pronunciation of \\"Que quoi?\\" (\\"What‚Äôs that?\\").Orledge, The Frogweb. Recordings Recordings of the Enfantines have been primarily confined to more comprehensive editions of Satie's piano music, including those by Aldo Ciccolini, France Clidat, Jean-Pierre Armengaud, Jean-Jo√´l Barbier, Olof H√∂jer, Kl√°ra K√∂rmendi, and Jean-Yves Thibaudet.

Biography Emmy Drachmann (n√©e Culmsee) was born as the youngest of nine children parented by Frederik Leopold Culmsee (1811‚Äì95) and Nicoline Rasmussen (1818‚Äì86). She was born in K√∏ge but grew up at the Havreholm Paper Mill which her father owned. She first met Holger Drachmann, a friend of her elder brother, Valdemar, when he visited Havreholm in 1866. At the age of 13, Emmy moved to Kristiania with her parents and stayed there until 1876 when she moved to Hamburg to study language. Drachmann paid her a visit but when she realized it was due to his interest in her sister Polly Thalbitzer she left for England where she assumed a position as German teacher in a pastor's house. During a holiday with friends in Hamburg in 1878, she was contacted by Drachmann's sister who informed her about the writer's breakdown after Polly had left him. She went to Copenhagen to nurse him and they were later married in St Paul's Church on 17 May 1879. They adopted Drachmann's daughter with Polly and had four more children. Their marriage marked the beginning of a calm and productive period for Holger Drachmann. Emmy assisted him with the translation of Byron's Don Juan. She later translated Gottfried Keller's Der gr√ºne Heinrich (1883‚Äì84) as well as works by authors such as Rudolf Baumbach, Peter Rosegger, Sergey Stepnyak- Kravchinsky and Peter Kropotkin. In 1887, Holger Drachmann began an affair with the cabaret singer \\"Edith\\" and in 1892 left their home. Emmy Drachmann travelled with her children to Dresden, where they lived for five years while she began her career as an author. Emmy and Holger Drachmann were divorced in 1903. She died in Roskilde in 1928 and is buried at Vestre Cemetery in Copenhagen. Works Emmy Drachmann published the novel Grevinde Cossel in 1899. It was followed by Villa Mackenzie (1902), Inger (1910), a fictional account of her marriage, and M√∏dre (1914). Her memoir Erindringer. Barndom og Ungdom til 1883 (until 1883) was published in 1925.

She also worked as head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' architecture department. Early life and education India Boyer was born on June 27, 1907, to Ethel and Calvin Boyer in Shelby County, Ohio. She was named after India Schoaff, a family friend. India's mother was the first woman to serve on the Perry Township Board of Education, while her father was an agriculturalist. She had two brothers, Ralph and Howard, one of whom became an engineer and the other a metallurgist. In 1925, India graduated as valedictorian of her class at Pemberton High School and, with the encouragement of her parents and brothers, went on to Ohio State University. The year she entered, Ohio State's Department of Architecture opened its doors to women for the first time, and India was one of the six who enrolled. Boyer was surprised to learn that military training was a requirement of the architectural program, but she refused to participate in it. The difficult workload eliminated the other women in the architectural field of study until only India Boyer remained. Boyer's fellow students were cool towards her at first, but her perseverance earned their respect and eventually they warmed up enough to lend a hand with a critical design project towards the end of her time in the program. However, serious obstacles remained: at one point she learned that she was not eligible to take part in a competitive examination that allowed the winner to study architecture in France over the summer. She protested her exclusion and was told that the reason for it was that she \\"might win and there were no facilities for women there.\\" During her junior and senior year, she worked for local architect Joseph Bradford. She graduated in 1930 in a class of 1,450 students of whom only 11 were architects and Boyer the only woman. Career The Great Depression struck just as India entered the job market. She struggled for four years trying to make a career in a profession in which women were barely accepted before giving up and taking an exam for the U.S. Army Corps for Engineers. The Corps offered her a permanent job working on navigation and flood control projects, and in 1939 she was promoted to head of the Corps of Engineers' architecture department, a position she held for seven years. During World War II, she was involved in designing buildings for wartime needs, including hospitals, airports, supply depots, warehouses, and housing. Boyer never gave up her dream of becoming an architect in private practice. In 1941 she made history as the first woman in Ohio to sit and pass the state architecture exam. After four more years with the Corps of Engineers, Boyer and colleagues Robert C. Vogt and William J. Ivers resigned and founded the architectural firm of Vogt, Ivers and Associates in Cincinnati, Ohio. Despite not being included in the firm's name, India became head of the firm and found herself up against tough competition from all-male practices. Boyer's interests ranged from commercial to industrial, recreational, educational buildings. She is known in the Cincinnati area for designing the Elmwood Place School and the Shawnee Park. During this time, the Ryerson Steel Company was expanding and Boyer helped with their architectural plans. Later life Boyer suffered a heart attack in 1975 and as a consequence had to retire early, although she continued to work as a consultant for the Hamilton County Park District, Elmwood Place School, and Shawnee Park. Even after she stopped being active in architecture, Boyer continued to receive local awards such as the YMCA Women of Achievement award and the Outstanding Alumnus Award from Ohio State University. In 1994 a group of women who considered her a role model established the India Boyer Guild of Women in Architecture in her honor. She died in Cincinnati on February 9, 1998, at the age of 90.The Sidney Daily News, February 12, 1998, pg. 2A.

Grodno Zoo was founded in 1927 as the first zoo in future Belarus on the initiative of the high school teacher Jan Kochanowski. In 1926 Kochanowski, together with his pupils, established a botanical garden in the city park, which in 1927 received the first animals. The new zoological department had 17 species of local fauna. Nine years later in 1936, Grodno zoo had about 400 exhibits, The second world war more or less destroyed the zoo, and not much was left in 1944. On 12 December 1944 the Executive Committee of Grodno decided to restore the zoo. The zoo opened its gate again on 28 September 1946. The first Asian elephant arrived on 30 August 1955 from Vietnam. Grodno Zoo became a member of EARAZA in 2009. Jan Kochanowski The founder of Grodno Zoo, Jan Kochanowski, was born in 1894 in the city of Grodno. In 1942, local Polish resistance fighters were arrested by the Gestapo for the alleged murder of a German doctor and imprisoned along with other representatives of the intelligentsia of Grodno. When the city turned to the occupation authorities for the release of hostages, the Gestapo chief agreed not to shoot all of the captives. Among the captives to be shot was one Kochanowski teacher J√≥zef Wiewi√≥rski - the father of five or six children. The remaining hostages, including Jan Kochanowski, were to be set free, but Kochanowski appealed to the German officer to include him among those sentenced to death instead of J√≥zef Wiewi√≥rski, since he did not have a family. In the autumn of 1942 Jan Kochanowski was shot dead. Wiewi√≥rski was executed in 1943 together with his family.

It was designed by Arthur Morry and built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Arthur Morry, 1890 Nassagaweya was built in c.1885 by architect Arthur Morry as his own residence. He was later to become mayor of the City of South Brisbane and a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for South Brisbane. After Morry left the house in 1895 the property was probably rented until 1915 when it was purchased by a Scottish-Canadian, John Gillies. He named the house Nassagaweya after his birthplace of Nassagaweya Township in Ontario, a Delaware Indian word meaning \\"home by the maple forests\\". Gillies died in 1946 and the house remains in the family. Today it occupies a corner site, the adjoining streets of which are named after two previous owners of the property, Gray and Morry.  Description  View from Morry Street, 2015 Nassagaweya and front lawn, 2015 Nassagaweya is a two-storeyed timber house (c.1885) with a pyramid roof in corrugated iron, which was previously slate. Built on a corner block, the square-shaped core has a number of gabled projections on the street frontages. The front elevation is dominated by a double-storeyed gabled verandah on the left which has cast-iron balusters and frieze and a pierced timber valance. On the right is a gabled portico. This leads onto a small verandah, enclosed by timber louvres, which projects to the side. The side elevation is a complex arrangement of gabled insert verandahs, the louvred verandah and a projecting kitchen entry. Internally, the room spaces and joinery reflect the innovative spirit of the exterior. The house remains unaltered except for a room apparently added at the rear. The overall effect is an unusual and whimsical composition. Outbuildings, including stables, burnt down some time ago.  Heritage listing  Nassagaweya was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. One of several, sizeable timber houses built at Hill End during the 1880s boom. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Nassagaweya is significant as an individualistic and intact 1880s residence. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Nassagaweya is significant for its close association with architect and politician Arthur Morry, built as his own residence.

The name was proposed by Denham and Crook in 1976, to describe a thermal front that extends from Australia and New Zealand between the Coral Sea and Tasman Sea. Originating in the edge of the East Australian Current (EAC), the Tasman Front meanders eastward between longitudes 152¬∞ E and 164¬∞ E and latitudes 31¬∞ S and 37¬∞ S, then reattaches to the coastline at New Zealand, forming the East Auckland Current. Topography plays a dominant role in establishing the Tasman Front. Data on the Tasman Front shows that the path of the front is influenced in part by the forcing of the flow over the major ridge systems. Meanders observed in the Tasman Front can be driven by meridional flows along ridges such as those observed at the New Caledonia Trough (166¬∞ E) and the Norfolk Ridge (167¬∞ E). Abyssal currents also drive meanders associated with the Lord Howe Rise (161¬∞ E) and Dampier Ridge (159¬∞ E). There have been a number of observational and modeling studies on this front in addition to a number of paleo-oceanographic studies of marine sediments. Contrarily, there have been few biological observational studies, but those have been conducted resulted in relating the physical features of the front to properties of fish communities. Likewise, there are even fewer studies relating biogeochemical properties to physical processes of the Tasman Front.

It depicts three young men grouped around a dinner table playing music. It is painted in chiaroscuro, a Baroque painting technique that made use of the contrast between light and dark shadows to achieve a sense of volume. Painting The Three Musicians is one of Vel√°zquez's earliest works, from his early Seville period. It is one of approximately ten paintings in the bodeg√≥n style that Vel√°zquez created before 1622, while living in Seville. Its subject is similar to that of another painting, The Farmers' Lunch. In this painting three young men are grouped around a table eating, drinking and playing music, with strong contrasts of light and darkness around the figures. The light falls from the left, creating sharp shadows and intense highlights. Two men with stringed instruments are singing while the third, the youngest, has an instrument of his own under his arm and a glass of wine in his hand; he displays the glass with a mocking smile, pointing out the wine that inspires the musicians. In the background can be seen a monkey with a pear in hand. The monkey emphasizes the grotesque nature of the scene. A loaf of bread on a napkin, a glass of wine, and a piece of cheese with a knife stuck into it give Vel√°zquez the opportunity to study the different textures. An interesting feature of The Three Musicians is the variety of issues raised, such as whether it is a genre representation or whether behind the supposedly everyday scene there are hidden layers of meaning, which can make the picture readable as an allegory, giving it a different interpretation.

It draws on Mesoamerican, Spanish Roman Catholic, and Mexican rituals, incorporating many diverse cultural traditions with the common goal of honoring and remembering the deceased. Background All Souls Weekend is more commonly known as All Souls Procession weekend and is derived from the All Souls Procession, an event first initiated and organized in 1990 by Tucson artist Susan Kay Johnson to \\"express her sorrow\\" over the recent death of her father and to initiate an artistic ritual in honor of the dead in Tucson. Johnson had studied art therapy based in part on the work of Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung including his study of rituals in cultures around the world. After her father died, Johnson planned and invited other artists to participate in a three-day ritual, which lasted from Halloween through All Saints Day and ended on All Souls Day. The ritual took place in public and private spaces in downtown Tucson, and involved art objects Johnson created for the event. These objects included \\"a giant fabric-and-wire cocoon big enough to hold 15 masked performers who snaked through the neighborhood and emerged as butterflies to dance to the cue of a flute player.\\" By 1991, public interest the ritual led Johnson and other artists to apply for a grant from the Tucson Partnership in order to involve the Tucson community in the event, through free public workshops in art and music followed by a large procession. One of the artists listed on the grant application, Mykl Wells, has reported that he helped Johnson write the 1991 grant application, on which his name is spelled \\"Michael Wells.\\" Wells has reported that he helped inspire Johnson's initial planning of the 1990 All Souls Procession when he told Johnson about D√≠a de los Muertos rituals he had witnessed in Guanajuato, Mexico in the 1980s. Controversy Organizers of All Souls Weekend have made explicit efforts to present the All Souls Procession and associated events as inclusive of but distinct in origin from D√≠a de los Muertos, partly in response to charges of cultural appropriation by academic critics who have charged that its organizers and participants have primarily been Anglo-Americans. Similar charges have been directed at the Day of the Dead parade in the Mission District in San Francisco. However, with All Souls Weekend events now bringing together over 100,000 people of varying backgrounds in a public celebration in downtown Tucson, the organizers influence but do not control the traditions participants choose to represent and honor in the event. Each year thousands of participants in All Souls Weekend activities choose to wear calavera-style makeup and objects, familiar to many in Tucson due to the city's location 50 miles from the US-Mexico border. After the Spanish conquest of middle America, ancient Mesoamerican rituals merged with Roman Catholic tradition along with modern cultural interests in the Americas, yielding the holiday known today as D√≠a de los Muertos in Spanish or Day of the Dead in English. At least one writer has argued that All Soul‚Äôs Weekend in Tucson represents a further step in the evolution of precolonial Mesoamerican rituals and Day of the Dead. Though there is evidence the All Souls Procession was directly inspired by the history of Day of the Dead, the organizers of the All Soul‚Äôs Weekend emphasize that the event includes and encourages all forms of individual expression, drawing from many cultures, religions, and rituals.Many Mouths One Stomach. \\"The All Souls Procession, History\\", 2014.

He worked in many jobs: as a barber's boy, shop assistant, cordial factory employee, bitumen spreader, and in a fruit packing shed at Merbein in 1919. The big strike of that year forced his parents to leave Broken Hill, and they moved to 3 Vine Street Prospect. In 1922, he was a shop assistant, and in 1924 he started driving a bread cart for Nicholls Bros. of Nailsworth. In 1927 he was fined ¬£11/10/ for his part in an illegal gambling operation at the Northern Hotel, Enfield. He was a delegate to ALP Council meetings from 1928 as the representative of the Breadcarters' Union, and in 1936 became their full-time secretary, and greatly increased the influence of that organisation. He became a member of the Australian Labor Party executive in 1940, and held that position for many years. In 1944 he was elected to the Prospect seat in the House of Assembly. At the declaration of the poll in 1944 he made a forceful attack on the Communist Party and its leader Dr. Alan Finger, who was one of his opponents. He served for a year as a Government representative on the board of Adelaide University, then lost his seat in Parliament at the following election in 1947. In 1949 he was elected secretary of the Trades and Labor Council, and in 1940 elected secretary of the Trades Hall management committee and secretary of the Labor Day celebration committee. In 1949, as a moderate, he deposed Tom Garland (a former Communist) as secretary of the Trades and Labor Council, winning the election by 17 votes. The same year, he was made treasurer of the Breadcarters' Union, and held that position for many years. In 1951 he represented Australian workers at the International Labour Organization conference at Geneva, and during that trip attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace, which infuriated some of members of Trades Hall. In 1953 he represented the ACTU at the New Zealand Federation of Labor conference. In February 1956 he was elected to the Legislative Council as a member for Central No. 1 district, and held the seat until July 1975. Shard was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1977 Australia Day Honours for service to government. Other interests He played lawn bowls and was for a time president of the Broadview Bowling Club. He was a longtime supporter of junior football clubs in the North Adelaide district and a follower of the North Adelaide Football Club, and a committee member from 1940 to 1947, then was reelected in 1950. Family He married Muriel Mavis Whiting in 1927; they had two sons: *Bruce Walter Shard (1928‚Äì1999) *Ross David Shard (10 September 1929 ‚Äì ) They lived at Goldfinch Avenue, Cowandilla in 1925 and at 6 Le Cornu Street Broadview in 1950.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2007.  History  The Dornoch Terrace Bridge was built in 1941 by the Brisbane City Council. It provides a vehicular and pedestrian thoroughfare down Dornoch Terrace towards the Brisbane River. Built as an overpass across Boundary Street, the bridge allows access to the road below by a series of staircases and a slip road. The Bridge is a prominent landmark in the West End and Highgate Hill area and reflects the period when Boundary Street was regraded as part of an ambitious scheme to connect West End to the new University of Queensland campus at St Lucia. The excavations are supported by concrete retaining walls, faced in fine stonework, creating dramatic approaches to the bridge and incorporating connecting staircases and a slip road between the two streets. The Dornoch Terrace Bridge and associated retaining walls survive as the only visible evidence of this ambitious scheme. Highgate Hill was first settled by Europeans in 1856. The first European settler in this area was Mr. Trimble, an officer at the Customs House. He was followed by many new settlers, including the Wilson family, famed for naming the area \\"Highgate Hill\\". Prior to European settlement of this area there was a track along the present Dornoch Terrace through to the present Gladstone Road and through to Annerley. In the mid 1800s Dornoch Terrace was known as \\"The Broad Road\\", and ran atop the area we now know as Highgate Hill. Initially a farming area, by 1889, the area around Dornoch Terrace became increasingly built up and populated. A reservoir was built on the corner of Dornoch Terrace and Gladstone Road to service the growing population. Not long after this much of the land surrounding Dornoch Terrace was subdivided into various estates. The increase in urban population in the Highgate Hill area can be partly attributed to the rapid growth of industry in the West End area, especially along the river. Initially the main industry in this area was timber. Once the area had been cleared of timber, factories were subsequently constructed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, many along the river and on Montague Road (well below the high hill of Dornoch Terrace). A variety of industries were established and included a gas works (West End Gasworks and Gas Stripping Tower), a concrete pipes works, a soft drink factory, a boot factory, glass works and an ice-cream plant. The introduction of a public transport system to service the Highgate Hill area began with the Soden omnibus service in 1878. This ran from the city centre, across the river and up to Dornoch Terrace, from there it would travel to Ipswich Road. Electric trams were introduced to Brisbane in the early 1900s, and by 1908 Highgate Hill could be reached by this service. The electric trams travelled all the way up Hardgrave Road and down to the Hill End ferry. There was also a tram service that travelled up Boundary Street, this however, ceased well below the summit of Dornoch Terrace. The bridge was never used for trams. Tram services ceased in 1969. Several large houses were built along Dornoch Terrace at this time, including \\"Torbreck\\" (now the apartment building Torbreck) and Kinauld, designed by architect Alexander Brown Wilson and built in 1888. The building of these prestigious houses signifies the growth and increased wealth of the Highgate Hill area, in particularly along Dornoch Terrace. There were two prior bridges known to span Boundary Street. A map of 1895 reveals that an \\"over bridge\\" was in existence and in December 1888, the South Brisbane Municipal Council approved a tender by the firm of Walters and Cooper to construct a bridge at this intersection. This late 1880s bridge existed until the current bridge replaced it in 1941. This earlier bridge was known to locals as the \\"Black Bridge\\" due to wet tar falling from wagons carrying felled timber. The ends of the timber were washed with tar, and on the journey across the bridge the tar would drip onto the road and subsequently be splashed onto the bridge railings. In 1909 the University of Queensland was formed, and was initially accommodated in Old Government House at Gardens Point. However, in 1926, Dr James O'Neil Mayne and Miss Mary Emelia Mayne donated to the Brisbane City Council to resume land at St Lucia and this was to become the new site of the University. Due to the Great Depression there was no prospect of building the new university until 1935 when the Queensland Premier, William Forgan Smith, announced that the Queensland Government would undertake construction at St Lucia. Part of this construction was the proposal to build a bridge over the Brisbane River from West End to St. Lucia. Building a bridge over the Brisbane River involved developing a suitable approach from the city to the proposed bridge included the resumption of land and excavation along Boundary Street. Drawings for a new bridge carrying Dornoch Terrace over Boundary Street, and associated retaining walls, were prepared between 1939 and 1941 and the works were carried out by the Brisbane City Council. The University of Queensland development was suspended during the Second World War, the St. Lucia Bridge project was subsequently postponed. When work resumed after the War, the University building program was revised and downsized due to inflated building costs. The bridge connecting West End to St. Lucia never eventuated; however, in 1941 the Dornoch Terrace Bridge was built. Excavation of the approach to the proposed West End to St. Lucia bridge, Brisbane, 1940 The building of the Dornoch Terrace Bridge was achieved with no major hurdles. The bridge was designed to sit somewhat lower in elevation to the original \\"Black Bridge\\". This was due to the side accesses running down the bridge onto Boundary Street below. It was also to attain a comfortable slope down Dornoch Terrace towards Hill End. During the construction of the bridge the embankments were dug away, what was removed was then reused in the Victoria Park embankment on Bowen Bridge Road. Today the Dornoch Terrace Bridge receives a great deal of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, both over and under. It provides an easy pedestrian thoroughfare to the West End shops on Boundary Street, vehicular and pedestrian access to the restaurants at Hill End, and ease of access to the houses and apartments for Highgate Hill residents.  Description  The Dornoch Terrace Bridge in Highgate Hill is a distinctive landmark, which is highly visible from both northern and southern approaches along Boundary Street. The northern view along Boundary Street undulates through corrugated iron roofed cottages and past local landmarks such as the Kurilpa Library clock tower. Looking south, the scene takes in the St Lucia Reach of the Brisbane River and the suburbs beyond. Its arch spans the excavated Boundary Street, and Dornoch Terrace passes over it. The excavations are supported by concrete retaining walls, faced in fine stonework. Pedestrian access is via incorporated concrete staircases and ramps, and vehicular traffic access between the two streets is provided by a slip road. View down Boundary Street Located at the highest point in Boundary Street, the bridge's arch terminates powerful axial views along West End's main thoroughfare. Looking south and upwards from the West End shopping area, the eye is led past the Kurilpa Library clocktower towards the bridge. From the south, the arch is also a prominent part of the streetscape. The Dornoch Terrace roadway is supported by a painted concrete vault, generated by a basket-handle arch and sprung from concrete abutments on either side of Boundary Street. The abutments stand proud of the surrounding stone retaining walls and feature a plinth and impost painted in a contrasting green. The off-form striated finish of the vault's soffit is evident beneath the paintwork, whereas other parts of the bridge appear to be rendered and painted. The arch features an architrave painted in a contrasting green and crowned with a keystone. Above the spandrels, the bridge's solid concrete balustrade features a rendered stringcourse at pavement level and a simple concrete capping. The balustrades are terminated at each end by a pair of Brisbane Tuff piers, except at the eastern end of the southern balustrade which ends in a single stone pier. The balustrade and abutment walls of the bridge are frequent targets for graffiti attacks and bear evidence of many attempts to paint over them. =Retaining walls and bridge approaches= To facilitate pedestrian and vehicular movement between the two streets, a slip road and a series of staircases and ramps were integrated into the treatment of approaches to the bridge. Fine Brisbane Tuff walls taper out from the bridge, supporting surrounding houses. The stonework to the retaining walls is generally Brisbane Tuff rubblework. The stones are hammer finished to effect a flat surface and carefully shaped and positioned, eliminating the use of infill pieces and effecting the random distribution of Brisbane Tuff colours. The pointing is generally proud of the stone face and shaped into smooth curves. =Western approach - Dornoch Terrace= Lower western approach, 2015 The main feature of this approach is the narrow two-way slip road along the southern side. This is the only vehicular connection between Dornoch Terrace and Boundary Street Near-vertical retaining walls rise from each side of the slip road. The wall rising to Dornoch Terrace is surmounted by concrete capping and a simple painted post and rail fence. The wall on the southern side incorporates openings to stairways to the properties above. A small section of this wall curves around into Boundary Street. =Southern approach - Boundary Street - eastern side= The retaining wall stepping down from the southern side of the bridge supports flights of stairs alternating with gentle ramps. The stonework is finished to the profile of the stairs and ramps and capped with concrete. The capping, in turn, supports a balustrade of solid concrete panels spanning between stonework piers. Like the piers on the bridge itself, these consist of Brisbane Tuff ashlaring with a bevelled capping piece. The retaining wall between the stair and the adjoining property to the east comprises sections of brickwork and Brisbane Tuff ashlaring. =Northern approach - Boundary Street - eastern side= This embankment extends from the bridge down to outside 222 Boundary Street. It combines exposed rock faces, vegetation, dry masonry closest to the bridge, sections of fine stonework similar to that used on other embankments. Part of this stonework appears to have fallen away from the concrete retaining wall behind. =Northern approach - Boundary Street - western side= This embankment supports a pedestrian walkway from the bridge to the corner of Bristol Street. In an unusual arrangement, the stair at the bottom of this walkway passes below the awning of what appears to be a former corner shop. The path, supported on a stonework retaining wall, then ramps up to a dog-leg. Here the retaining wall rakes down to form a low wall in front of a vegetated rock face, before raking up again to meet the bridge. The dog-leg in the path takes it behind this overgrown embankment and connects it with the footpath on Dornoch Terrace. A simple painted timber handrail follows the top of the retaining wall.  Heritage listing  Dornoch Terrace Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Dornoch Terrace Bridge is part of a substantial road expansion / infrastructure project undertaken by the Brisbane City Council and is evidence of the 1930s proposal to connect West End and the University of Queensland at St Lucia. It is important as an indication of a phase in Queensland's history when the value of education, and providing suitable academic institutions, was beginning to be recognised. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Consisting of substantial stone retaining walls, supporting pedestrian and vehicular paths and associated residential development, Dornoch Terrace Bridge is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places as it displays uncommonness in bridge design in Queensland as well as being an important community facility in the past and the present. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a prominent landmark in the district, the scale, texture and colour of the walls have considerable visual impact on Boundary Street, Dornoch Terrace and the surrounding streets. The bridge provides attractive views from Dornoch Terrace and is itself an important scenic element.

It has a large ear with grains that are more white, round, and tender than the typical field corn grain. The dried grains are soaked and/or cooked in water with lime or wood ash, then rinsed thoroughly to remove the outer seed coat as well as any traces of the alkali salts (from the lime or ash)‚Äîthis is an ancient process called nixtamalization. This creates a fresh, wet hominy, which can be dried for later use or ground into a flour called masa to make tortillas, tamales, atole, pozole, etc. (the dry hominy can also be ground to make dry masa). When boiling the grains, they open by themselves like a flower, and a loose foam appears. The primary use of cacahuazintle grain is in the embodiment of the traditional Mexican dish pozole.

Written by lead singer Jason Wade, the track served as a preview of the band's album Out of the Wasteland, release in May 2015. It was the first new recording released by the band since their hiatus in July 2013. Background and composition Unlike previous Lifehouse singles, the song is a piano ballad, beginning solely with a simple chord and melody set before growing to include drums, bass, and electric guitar. After the second chorus, it builds to a climactic crescendo. Wade had previously stated that writing on the piano was a skill he had wanted to develop. Music video A lyric video directed by Thomas Kirk was released alongside the song, featuring actress TL Forsberg. The clip was filmed in one single shot with no cut, and weaves in and around an abandoned diner and motel in the desert in point of view before focusing on a woman sitting on a bed and communicating the song's closing lyrics to the camera using sign language.

Early life Borgstrom was born in Lycksele, Sweden in 1919. As a teenager, he began using his father‚Äôs tools to carve wooden cutlery and crockery and was strongly influenced by Lapp and Norrland settler culture. His career was largely focused upon spoon carving. Career In 1951, he moved to New Zealand and began incorporating New Zealand resources into his Scandinavian-influenced works. He used New Zealand and introduced timbers in his works, including kowhai, tanekaha, akeake, rewarewa, manuka, macrocarpa, cherry wood, privet, mangrove, and silky oak. Borgstrom worked by drawing a design on a piece of wood and roughly creating the shape using a Scandinavian bow saw. He would then use knives and chisels to further refine the carving, followed by work with files and rasps. The final stages of creating a spoon included sanding, waxing and oiling.

It is located at 561 C√¥te-Saint- Antoine Road on the corner of Victoria Avenue. History The land was purchased in 1699 by Jean Hurtubise, the son of Louis Hurtubise. Members of the Hurtubise family had lived there for 6 generations. Originally, the land around the house was farm fields. The Hurtubise family worked the land, which included an orchard and market garden. The property was divided in half in 1839, and numerous other times between 1847 and 1873. The Hurtubise family gave up farming in 1880 and the agricultural lands of C√¥te-Ste-Antoine became a residential area. The last occupant was Leopold Hurtubise, a doctor who died in 1955. Heirs of the doctor sold the house to three individuals: Mable Molson, Colin J.G. Molson, and James R. Beattie, their friend. This group established the Canadian Heritage of Quebec. In 1961, they transferred the ownership of the property to that organization. Leopold Hurtubise initially wished to sell the property to a local developer who wanted to demolish the house and use the land to build modern homes. Alice Lighthall persuaded him to delay signing the documents. She was a heritage activist and one of the founders of the Westmount Historical Association. In 1944, in response to the slated demolition of the house, Lighthall contacted newspapers and organized a protest meeting at Victoria Hall. Her efforts resulted in Mable Molson, Colin Molson, and James R. Beattie being able to buy the property. In 1956, Hurtubise House was saved from demolition by the Canadian Heritage of Quebec. It is now protected indefinitely. On December 16, 2004, the Minist√®re de la Culture et des Communications classified the house and land as a heritage site and subsequently restored it. The first phase took place in 2005 and involved the restoration of the first floor, roof, and chimney. The second phase was carried out in 2012 where the second floor, front gallery and stone wall on west side were restored. Financing for the restoration project came mostly from the Canadian Heritage of Quebec, Minist√®re de la Culture et des Communications, and the City of Montreal. Hurtubise House is open for visitation by appointment. The house Hurtubise House in 2011 The house was called \\"La haute folie\\" by those who lived in Ville Marie. This was because it was so distant from the safety of the town at the St. Lawrence River. Rear It is a 3-storey, gable-roof house built in rural French-style. For an urban home, it is larger than average for the period. There are stone walls that are thick. Around the windows are flat stones. This suggests a wealthy family as it was rare at the time. There are S-shaped holders and hinges designed to hold the shutters open. There is a flat stone that served as a kitchen sink. Wallpaper is from 1885. The first floor is supported by 3 trees, one of which still has bark. The attic is constructed with wooden posts and beams. There are ventilation holes in the basement walls to allow the storage of vegetables during the winter and prevent them from rotting. These holes were once thought to be gun holes to defend against \\"marauding natives\\". In the 1870s, an annex constructed of brick was added. References Further reading  External links *Robert J.

In 1880, he designed a ship that he felt could withstand the worst lake water and carry the greatest cargo in the least depth of water. Early life McDougall was born on March 15, 1845, on the island of Islay, Scotland. He was the eldest son of parents David and Ellen McDougall. In 1854, when McDougall was ten, he emigrated with his parents to the Canadian-Scotch settlement of Nottawa, Ontario, now part of Collingwood. In 1862, at the age of seventeen, McDougall shipped out on the Great Lakes after limited schooling. He had time to pursue his hobby of designing ships of steel, and his experience with the violent storms of the Great Lakes prompted him to design the Whaleback. Whaleback McDougall built his first whaleback barge on his property in Duluth, on a site now occupied by Jeff Foster Trucking (formerly Superwood Corp). Whaleback was made of iron with an unusual design: when fully loaded, only the round portion of the hull could be seen above the waterline. It had a rounded neck so that water would not stand on board, and a spoon shaped prow to reduce water resistance. Because of its rounded hull, it was also easier to load and unload goods. McDougall conceived of a Whaleback that could withstand the worst lake weather with maximal capacity of cargo. At first, he designed it to carry iron ore, but later it carried almost every commodity freighted by cargo ship. Between 1890 and 1893 McDougall built fifteen whalebacks, in collaboration with John D. Rockefeller. Among them, it include the famous steamer Christopher Columbus, the only passenger carrier; the Meteor, the last whaleback in operation, was constructed as the Frank Rockefeller in 1896. In all, McDougall built 44 whalebacks. He died on May 27, 1923, at the age of 78. Drawbacks The primary problem of the Whaleback design was its hatches. The edges of the hatch openings and their covers would get bent, destroying the watertight seal. Collisions between unloading equipment and the hatch edges also often occurred, resulting in slow loading and unloading.

Written by Bill Wells and J. B. White, the film is about a young widow unable to celebrate Christmas because of the memories invoked, who meets a Christmas tree shop owner who helps her start her own cookie business and in the process rediscover the spirit of the holiday. Plot A young widow, Kathy (Kellie Martin), is not putting up a Christmas tree this year. For years, she and her recently deceased husband gave each other Christmas ornaments as gifts that represented their love for each other. Now she keeps those ornaments locked away in order to avoid memories of her tragic loss. The only holiday tradition she observes now is baking Christmas cookies for her friends, which she's been doing since childhood. Shortly before Christmas, Kathy meets a handsome Christmas tree shop owner, Tim (Cameron Mathison), who tries to sell her a tree, but is initially unsuccessful. The two are attracted to each other, and soon she accepts a tree from him as a gift, as well as an ornament that symbolizes hope for her. She helps him deliver his trees, and he helps her start a new cookie business‚Äîsomething she's always dreamed of doing‚Äîand brings the joy of the Christmas season back into her life. Supported by her best friend, Jenna (Jewel Staite), and her newfound feelings of love for Tim, Kathy starts to accept the message of hope symbolized by Tim's ornament. Their relationship, however, is complicated by her memories of her husband and by Tim's ex-girlfriend, Rebecca, who comes back into his life unexpectedly. As Christmas approaches, they come to realize how much their love means to each other and their future together. Cast Release The Christmas Ornament first aired on the Hallmark Channel on November 16, 2013. Critical response In her review for the DVD Verdict website, Dawn Hunt gave the film a positive review, writing that it combines the joys of Christmas with a gradually developing love story. The film's effectiveness, according to Hunt, is due to the chemistry of the leading actors and the performances of a strong supporting cast.

Early life Freeman was born in Flushing, Queens to Mr. and Mrs. E. G. Freeman. His parents did not have a birth certificate issued for Freeman, but according to his widow he was born circa 1890. He attended public schools in Flushing. Flying =Instruction= Freeman attended the Wright Flying School on Long Island, New York, where he was instructed by Arthur L. Welsh. In addition to being Welsh's pupil, Freeman also served as his assistant. He assisted Welsh and did some flying during Robert J. Collier's October 1911 aerial exhibition at his estate outside Wickatunk, New Jersey. He later went to Dayton, Ohio, to train under Oscar Brindley. On January 10, 1912, he was granted a pilot's license (#84) by the Aero Club of America in Dayton, Ohio. =Atwood Park= That May he became an assistant flying instructor at the General Aviation Corporation flight school at Atwood Park in Saugus, Massachusetts. The school had more than any other aviation school in the country (43). Although the field's namesake, Harry Atwood, was the chief instructor, Freeman did most of the flying. His students included Jack McGee, H. Roy Waite, and Ruth Bancroft Law. On May 20, 1912, Freeman and Waite took part in a mock bombing of Fort Heath, Fort Banks, and the battleships New Jersey and Rhode Island (which were anchored Boston Harbor) by dropping sacks of flour with a note stating \\"What if this bomb, instead of flour, contained nitroglycerin's deadly power?\\" onto the targets. On May 25, 1912, Freeman and George C. Parker raced a Boston and Maine train in Lynn, Massachusetts. That afternoon he performed stunts over Revere Beach. On May 30, May 31, and June 1, 1912, Freeman participated in an aviation meet at Atwood Park that included some of the biggest aviators in the country, including Atwood, Lincoln Beachey, and Philip W. Page. During the meet, Atwood was granted permission by the United States Postmaster General's office to operate an airmail route between Lynn and Saugus. Freeman attempted two deliveries. His first fell into the Atlantic Ocean. His second delivery, containing 2,000 letters and postcards, successfully arrived in Lynn Common. On June 10, 1912, Atwood quit the flying school. The reasons given for his departure were that he could make more money in exhibition flights and he had become disenchanted with Freeman. Atwood took the school's only plane with him and as a result, the school closed. =Exhibition flying= After leaving Atwood Park, Freeman flew in exhibitions throughout New England and worked as a flying instructor for various companies. In 1912 he participated in a meet at Harvard Aviation Field that included Lincoln Beachey, Philip W. Page, Glenn L. Martin, Charles K. Hamilton, Blanche Stuart Scott, and Harriet Quimby. During the meet, Freeman raced Farnum Fish in a passenger-carrying event (which Fish won) and competed in a bombing event (which was won by Paul Peck), and performed aerial stunts with Martin, Hamilton, Page, and Fish. Because Freeman participated in the unsanctioned meet he was suspended by the Contest Committee of the Aero Club of America. The committee overturned his suspension later that year based on the \\"circumstances of this unusual case\\". In the fall of 1912, Freeman performed at exhibitions in Chicago, Illinois, Newark, Ohio, Suffolk, Virginia, and Louisville, Kentucky. In December 1912, Freeman married Helen Stevens of Brookline, Massachusetts. Stevens was not a fan of Freeman's flying and asked him to give it up. On February 24, 1913, Freeman announced that he was going to give up flying. Freeman eventually returned to flying. From 1913 to 1915 he was an instructor at the Wright Company's flight school in Mineola, New York. =World War I, accident, and death= In 1916, Freeman became involved in a private aviation venture backed by Edward A. Deeds, Harold E. Talbott, Harold E. Talbott, Jr., and Charles F. Kettering which eventually became the Dayton-Wright Company. Freeman served as the assistant flight instructor at the company's school in McCook Field. After the Signal Corps took control of McCook Field, the company moved to South Field in Moraine, Ohio. After the U.S. entered World War I the Dayton-Wright Company began manufacturing bomber and reconnaissance planes. Freeman was tasked with testing the planes. On June 27, 1918, the engine on Freeman's plane suddenly lost power during takeoff. However, he was able to land the plane. The mechanics went over the engine's fuel system and Freeman attempted another take off. The engine failed again, but Freeman was once again able to land it safely. The engine failed once more on the third takeoff, however a strong wind prevented Freeman from making the 360¬∞ turn needed to land the plane and it forcefully struck the ground. Freeman's head hit the instrument panel with such force that the ignition switches dug themselves into his head. He was driven to the nearest hospital where he was declared dead by an emergency room doctor.

It was designed by John Beauchamp Nicholson and built from 1887 to 1890. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Brighton Terrace, which consists of two sets of identical pairs of semi-detached houses, was apparently built for investment purposes for Emile Adrian Gaujard in 1889-90. Tenders for the construction of the four houses were called on 6 August 1887 by John B. Nicholson, a successful Brisbane architect who prospered in the boom conditions of the late 1880s. Gaujard was a wholesale and retail tobacconist and importer of Gaujard and Elson, which was located in Queen Street, Brisbane. The first two houses were completed in 1889 and were immediately let to A. Mirls, a commercial traveller and WH Robertson, a bank manager. Despite completion in 1890, the second pair of houses were not occupied until 1894. Each of the four houses was individually identified with its own name. At the time of Brighton Terrace's construction, South Brisbane as in other parts of city, was experiencing a boom period. Residential expansion for respectable middle-class families proliferated in South Brisbane, with the predominant housing type being the four roomed timber cottage with a corrugated iron roof. Terrace housing was not particularly popular as a housing style in early Brisbane, especially amongst the land authorities who were unhappy with the small allotments that resulted after subdivision of the multi-dwelling properties. The passing of the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act in 1885 abruptly brought an end to the early style of terrace housing in Brisbane. In response, developments, such as Brighton Terrace, were introduced as an alternative to terrace housing that retained some cost benefits in construction. The advantage of building Brighton Terrace as a pair of residences on two allotments was that each pair could be legally sold separately. Most houses in the vicinity of Brighton Terrace were privately owned residences owned by clerks, salesmen and accountants. Upon the death of Gaujard, ownership of the four houses passed to his daughter Helene Therese Nicol, who was spouse of George Bruce Nicol, co-founder of the West End Brewery. The property was sold in 1923 and later, with the addition of fibrous cement sheeting and internal subdivision, converted into twelve flats. In 1990 the buildings were substantially renovated back into four residences and individually sold.  Description  Residences and footpath, 2015 The two houses at the northern end, 2015 Brighton Terrace is built on steeply sloped land that drops down from the street frontage and overlooks Brisbane city. The timber picket fence that extends across the entire street length of the terrace was constructed in 1990. Wooden decking provides access to the houses that are set back from the street boundary. Gardens exist only at the rear of the properties where the land evens out. No original vegetation survives as the grounds were extensively re-landscaped with palm trees, low shrubbery and brick paving in 1990. The four residences which collectively form Brighton Terrace are basically identical. The timber houses are each single storied at street level, with a subfloor level at the rear where the land falls away. Each pair of residences is housed under a single gabled hip roof that is clad in corrugated iron. Projecting gables at the front of each house are decorated with timber sunburst designs and finials while the eaves have pairs of brackets. The exterior walls are clad with narrow chamferboards. Windows at the front of each house are timber framed double hung sashes that have been grouped in threes. Each house consists of six main rooms and three bathrooms, the plan of which is roughly rectangular. The facades are asymmetrically arranged so that the front bedroom of each house projects forward and a small verandah is created. Original cast iron lacework and posts decorate the front verandahs and the window hood brackets. At the rear of each house are verandahs at two levels that are decorated with introduced timber balustrading and decorative timber brackets. The verandahs are separated by a deep timber valance and the soffits are fitted with introduced ripple iron that has been painted. The brick firewalls which separate the pairs of residences, are cement rendered at the front of the properties only and plastered internally. The internal partition walls at street level are single skinned with vertical beaded tongue and groove boards on a timber frame. The ceilings are also tongue and grooved boards except in the living and dining rooms where plasterboard with plaster ceiling roses has been introduced. At the lower level the walls and ceilings are all plasterboard on timber frames. Floors throughout the house are timber boards overlaid with carpet in the main rooms and vinyl or ceramic tiles in the kitchen and bathrooms. Some original cedar joinery such as architraves and four panelled doors survive at the street level, however most, including the timber fireplace surrounds and the timber consoles in the entry hall, have been introduced during the 1990 renovations. Obscure patterned glass has been fitted into the fanlights above each door at street level and coloured glass into the sidelights of the front door. Each house has two sets of staircases connecting the two floor levels; one internal and the other external. The internal staircase has been entirely reconstructed however the external staircase at the rear contains some original fabric at its upper reaches. The existing kitchen and bathroom fittings and fixtures were all introduced at the time of renovation. At the rear of each property is a large gabled timber garage with loft above. The structures were constructed in 1990. Access to the garages is via a common driveway located between the two pairs of residences.  Heritage listing  Brighton Terrace was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Brighton Terrace, completed in 1890, is important for its ability to visually demonstrate an unusual response to the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act of 1885 had on the built environment of Brisbane during the boom of the late 1880s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. This particular response, which involved the speculative construction of an identical pair of semi-detached houses built in timber on two separate allotments, was comparatively rare in Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The terrace is important as an example of multi dwelling construction that was uncommon in Brisbane in the late nineteenth century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The residences are of considerable aesthetic significance for their strong contribution to the streetscape, currently enhanced by their coordinated colour scheme and detailing.

According to the University of the Philippines Archaeological Studies Program, or UP- ASP, the closest settlement can be found in New Ibajay, which is covered by the town capital of El Nido, which is located around south-east of Dewil Valley. Physically it measures around long, and wide. It is in this place which the Ille Cave, one of the main archaeological sites, can be found. It is actually a network of 3 cave mouths located at its base.Paz, V., Ronquillo, W., Lewis, H., Piper, P., Carlos, J., Robles, E. Xhauflair, H. (2008). Palawan Island Paleohistoric Research Project: Report on the 2008 Valley field season. Research Project, Archaeological Studies Program of the Philippines; National Museum of the Philippines, Archaeological Studies Program of the Philippines. Retrieved November 8, 2014, from www.researchgae.net It has been discovered that this site in particular has been used and occupied by humans over multiple time periods. Although excavations for this site have been done since 1998, according to UP-ASP, surveys and recordings have been done as early as the 1920s by Carl Guthe, in an attempt to record as many archaeological sites in northern Palawan as possible. This sparked the interest of Robert Fox (1970), but was also limited to recordings rather than excavations. It was only in 1990 that a full archaeological survey was made by the National Museum of the Philippines and it was only in 1998 that the first test excavation was started. In 1999, a full excavation by archaeologists Solheim, De La Torre, and Bautista. Since then, multiple excavations have been made, with one of the most recent ones being in 2012.  Archaeological Discoveries  Different archaeological evidences led to different revelations about the area. During the first excavation in 1998, the archaeologist were able to discover shell middens and human burials. Excavations in Ille continued in 2000 and 2002 at the west mouth and east mouth with deeper excavations. Evidence of shell middens, burials and similar artifacts in previous excavations were found. Dating of the cultural deposits below the shell midden placed it at an age of around 10,000 years old. Archaeological Studies Program, University of the Philippines. (n.d.). Dewil Valley, New Ibajay Archaeological Investigations. Retrieved November 8, 2014, from Archaeological Studies Program: http://asp.upd.edu.ph/palawanproject/index.html Continued excavations in 2004 resulted to the discovery of more human burials. In 2005, artifacts such as pottery design and nephrite ornaments reinforced the connection of Palawan to Mainland Southeast Asia. Excavations in 2006 resulted to greater understanding of the stratigraphy of the cave and the first cremation burial was first uncovered in the east mouth trench. In the field season in 2007 of Ille cave, approximately eleven complete and incomplete burials were found in the east and west mouth trenches including possibly human cremations and tiger bones in the east mouth trench. Further exploration of other cave sites in the valley were explored and evidences of human activity along with archaeological features and burial with grave goods were found near the cave entrance of Pasimbahan cave. In 2008, continuing excavations of the Ille site reconfirmed the practice of cremation with the recovery of two cremation features at the 9000 years deposit. = Ille Cave = Ille Cave is part of a massive Late Eocene Pabellion karst-formation in New Ibajay, El Nido, Palawan. It is about high and has an overhang about high that extends from the mouth of the cave. It is located at the base of a limestone tower. The cave has two main mouths facing the south: the east mouth and the west mouth. Both mouths have large trenches placed on them. Vegetation of mostly secondary growth trees surround and top the cave. The ground of the cave is mostly dry, but some areas are wet due to the water dripping down from the ceiling. Based on radiocarbon dating, the cave was used as a habitation and burial site (Neolithic to Protohistoric). In 1998 alone, 20,000 artifacts were excavated by the National Museum and the Archaeological Studies Program of the University of the Philippines Diliman and the Solheim Foundation. Several artifacts date back to more or less 14,000 years ago. Adze blades and their fragments were used as samples to determine the date of the cave and it was discovered that the cave was used extensively during the Paleolithic and Neolithic. Ongoing excavation has determined the cave to be continuously inhabited from fairly recent times to the Late Pleistocene. So far, excavations have provided a cultural timeline down to the Upper Paleolithic and Pleistocene. Two articulated phalanx bones of a tiger were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools in Ille Cave near the village of New Ibajay. The other animal fossils were ascribed to macaques, deer, bearded pigs, small mammals, lizards, snakes and turtles. From the stone tools, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones. Additionally, the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the Upper Paleolithic. The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the cortical bone due to weathering, which suggests that they had post-mortem been exposed to light and air. Tiger parts were commonly used as amulets in South and Southeast Asia, so it may be that the tiger parts were imported from elsewhere, as is the case with tiger canine teeth, which were found in Ambangan sites dating to the 10th to 12th centuries in Butuan, Mindanao. On the other hand, the proximity of Borneo and Palawan also makes it likely that the tiger had colonized Palawan from Borneo before the Early Holocene. = Burials = A total of 32 burials in various phases have been discovered and recorded from this site. Most burials at the oldest phase have been found to have bivalve shell beddings under the buried individuals (UP-ASP, 2008). Only two burials were found with associated material culture‚Äîthe first one, with a metal point, and an infant with an Indo-Pacific bead bracelet. The recovered remains point to its community having early and long-time burial traditions, as well as possibilities of jar burials (from sherds found). There is an evident practice of cremation of remains, as both human and animal remains with evidences of burning were found a pit, making this the only evident \\"cremation cemetery\\" of this age, so far. An evidence of a complex burial ritual was also discovered. The ritual involves an elaborate process of defleshing and disarticulation of bones, crushing of (large) bones, and lastly, cremation and burial. As the remains were also found to be tightly concentrated and compact, it was suggested that it might have been placed in a container that decomposed later on.Lara, M., Paz, V., & Solheim, W. (2013). Bone Modifications in an Early Holocene Cremation Buriam from Palawan, Philippines. International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, Abstract. doi:10.1002/oa.2326 The found remains were suggested to be of a young adult to middle adult female, dated 9000‚Äì9400 years old. Currently, this is the best documented burial of this kind in Southeast Asia, and this is the second archaeological burial in the Philippines. = Ceramics = A variety of earthenware pottery sherds were recovered from the site, amounting to approximately 12,600 pieces. Unfortunately, these finds cannot be confidently associated with any of the surfaces in the site due to turbation (postdepositional disturbance) of the layers where most of the sherds were discovered. However, some of the decorated sherds were traced back to 4000‚Äì5000 years ago, mostly red-slipped with impressed circular designs, with some circles filled white with either lime or clay. Other sherds were associated with the \\"Metal Period\\" (which was around 2500 to 1500 years ago in Philippine Archaeology) due to its designs with geometric forms (with some painted red), commonly associated with this period. Large pieces of undecorated sherds were also found that may have been fragments from burial jars. Majority of the pottery decorations are associated with Sa Hyunh-Kalanay pottery. Variations of the designs (in both technical and stylistic aspects) between the pottery from Ille Cave and other sites in Dewil Valley suggests that these may have been adapted from other traded pottery. Evidence of pottery firing have also been found in the Ille cave.Balbaligo, Y. (2010). Preliminary Report of the Earthenware Pottery from Ille Cave and Rockshelter, Palawan, Philippines. Hukay, 15, 1-20. While there are no primary jar burials in this site, Ille pottery would have probably played a vital role in burial practices of its communities of practice. Tradeware, although limited, were also found in Dewil Valley. Tradeware sherds recovered from the Ille platform were mostly brown stoneware, celadon, whiteware and brownware. These brown- glazed shards are determined to be \\"dusan\\" jars from the 10th century. On the other hand, shards found on the Ille tower were blue and white and quite a lot in number, making them easy to pick out. = Fossils = Many fossil remains had been dug up in different sites in Dewil Valley. An excavation in the Ille Cave provided the first proof that the tiger Panthera tigris once roamed the island of Palawan. A complete basal phalanx of the second digit of the left manus and the distal portion of a sub-terminal phalanx of the second digit of the left manus of a tiger specimen were recovered from the site. Also, a distal end and midshaft of a sub-terminal phalanx of another tiger were obtained.Piper, P., Ochoa, J., Lewis, H., Paz, V., & Ronquillo, W. (2008). The first evidence for the past presence of the tiger Panthera tigris (L.) on the island of Palawan, Philippines: Extinction in an island population. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 264(1-2), 123-127. doi:10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.04.003 stated that \\"it is probable that tigers first entered Palawan from Borneo and established a population in the Middle Pleistocene some 620 ka or 420 ka during periods when the expansion of the polar ice sheets reduced relative sea levels to their lowest at ca. ‚àí 130 m.\\" The tiger remains were associated with a large animal bone assemblage dating between c. 9,000 and 12,000 cal. yr. BP, which includes remains of snakes, lizards, macaques, pigs, deer and other mammals.(Lewis, et al. 2008) From the late Pleistocene until the early Holocene epoch, there was an abundance of deer in the island. However, deer became rarer while the number of pigs increased during Mid Holocene based on the records from the Ille and Pasimbahan sites.(Ochoa, et al. 2014) said that \\"the increased number of pig remains and scarcity of deer in the middle Holocene middens of Pasimbahan also strengthen the observation that there is a clear shift from deer to pig hunting by the middle Holocene\\". Aside from faunal remains, plant fossils were also recovered from the different sites. Many plant remains such as seeds, wood fragments and plant tissues were obtained from the Pasimbahan ‚Äì Magsanib site. After the sampling of archaeobotanical remains, results showed that \\"six out of the eleven plant tissues, seeds and nuts were found to be consistently transformed, either charred or probably mineralized state\\".(Ochoa, et al. 2014) The recovered seeds of Boehmeria, Platanifolia, and Macaranga were also said to be mineralized. Carbonized remains found include all fragments of Canarium hirsutum and another nut, parenchymatous tissues and wood fragments. Archaeobotany evidences from the site also point that the inhabitants practiced arboticulture and the collection of wild nuts. Cayron, J. G. (2011). Archaeology and Exchange in Palawan Island. PhD Thesis, National University of Singapore, Southeast Asian Studies. = Stone Tools = In total, there are more than 1000 stone tools discovered out of 50,000 artefacts recorded from Ille Cave‚Äî a part of Dewil Valley located in Brgy, New Ibajay, El Nido, Palawan‚Äî since the start of the excavations in 1998 under the direction of Wilhelm Solheim. These stone tools and other artifacts recovered helped provide estimate timeline for the deposit of the cave for the site. Excavations of both east and west mouth of Ille Cave in 2005 by the UP-ASP also showed presence of other stone materials and stone tools. It was reported that the sequence in the east mouth that was of silty topsoil contained post- Neolithic artifacts which includes stone and shell beads. In the west mouth, some graves were found with stone adze which may date to an early phase. Stone adze was also one of the most significant artifacts found in the excavation in the southern half of the trench of the west mouth.(Lewis, et al., 2006) Aside from this, stone flakes were also found in Phase E, the habitation and cremation practice phase dated 8,000 to c.a. 10,000, of Pasimbahan site located within the Magsanib district of Dewil. In addition, the assemblage of artifacts discovered by the UP-ASP and National Museum in the deposit labeled Midden 2, one of the caves in the Dewil Valley which was first investigated for its archaeological material in the year 2007, were composed of mainly of stone tools, together with consumed animal remains and shell fish. Stone tools found in Midden 2 were cobble size stone tools associated with shell food remains, and pig bones. These finds negated the hypothesis that the deposits labeled Midden 2 were not actually an in situ assemblage of stones, bones, and shells.(Ronquillo, et al., 2008) = Cultural Heritage = In the 1960s, Robert Fox (1970) headed a National Museum team that continued Guthe's work in northern Palawan; new sites were added to the list of sites first described by Guthe. A good number of these sites were from small islands located in Bacuit Bay. Of the sites Guthe surveyed, there were a few that National Museum excavated. One such site excavated in the 1960s was Leta-leta cave. Located in Lagen island, in the bay of Bacuit; the conclusion of the 1960s excavation led Fox (1970) to confidently describe the archaeology as a \\"Metal Age\\" burial site. The excavation was highlighted by the recovered unique earthenware jar with a mouth fashioned to look like a yawning/shouting person. This unique jar is now considered a national heritage artefact and displayed in the National Museum in Manila. The research and heritage work at Dewil has accumulated much information throughout its years of existence. In 2005 more artefacts were recovered at Ille in the form of pottery design and nephrite ornaments that reinforced the Mainland Southeast Asian connection of the site. In 2006 the excavation at Ille further expanded to include areas inside the cave itself. There were more artefacts recovered and the understanding of the stratigraphy became clearer. Excavation on the southern half of the trench continued with the aim of understanding the nature of having Neolithic and Metal Period deposits at deeper levels compared to most of the area of the trench. Further excavation on these contexts yielded more materials such as pottery fragments and human remains. Some of the pottery fragments were found in concentration and belong to one vessel. Some of the most significant artefacts found in this square were a stone adze, a complete pottery pedestal base, and a Melo amphora shell dipper. In total, there are more than 50,000 artefacts recorded from Ille since the start of the excavations in 1998; broken down to around 25,000 ceramics, 23,000 shell and bone artefacts, 1,000 stone tools and 1,000 metal artefacts and other materials.

It was built in 1908. It is also known as Dixon's Shoe Centre and T C Dixon & Sons. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 October 1998.  History  The Thomas Dixon Centre was constructed in 1908 as premises for the expanding business of Thomas Dixon, bootmaker and tanner. A substantial two- storey brick building, it was designed by Richard Gailey Architects. In 1869, encouraged by his brother who was already residing in Brisbane, Thomas Coar Dixon relocated from New South Wales, where he had established a small tannery, to Brisbane. Shortly after his arrival, Dixon established a tannery at West End, which was expanded in 1878 to incorporate a boot and shoe manufacturing business, with equipment, machinery and lasts brought by Dixon from Sydney. Tanneries and boot and shoe manufacturing were among the earliest established industries in Brisbane. In Barton's Jubilee History of Queensland it is stated that by 1909 there were 21 boot making factories, employing over 1000 people in the metropolitan area. T C Dixon and Sons are mentioned as one of the companies having recently constructed a large factory. The first Dixon shoe factory was opened in Russell Street and was announced in The Queenslander on 6 July 1878. The advertisement guaranteed that the TCD Brand was \\"equal to any boot manufactured\\" due to use of machines of the 'latest and most approved construction and the best materials only being used.' Disruptions to the business occurred in 1885 when fire destroyed the buildings and again in 1893 when floods damaged goods and swept the tannery shed away. By the early 1900s, Thomas Dixon's son was urging him to construct larger premises. This was partially due to the loss of the previous buildings, but also due to delays of customer orders due to the lack of space available for the employment of additional hands. In 1906, Dixon purchased the land bounded by Montague Road, and Raven and Drake Streets prior to travelling to Sydney to view the most recently constructed boot manufacturing premises. On his return to Brisbane, Dixon engaged architect Richard Gailey and (according to Dixon) with Dixon's suggestions and Gailey's skill they designed 'the present magnificent building.' Richard Gailey was one of Queensland's most prolific architects. Born in Ireland, he emigrated to Australia in 1864. Described as the 'doyen of Brisbane's architects,' he is responsible for the design of many substantial buildings in Brisbane, including the Bapist City Tabernacle, a number of hotels including the Regatta and the Orient, private homes including Moorlands and Verney, and commercial buildings and warehouses including Smellie and Co.'s Warehouse, the Metro Arts building and Finney Isles and Co. He also designed many buildings in various towns throughout Queensland. The contractor of the new Dixon's factory was Mr Burton. Constructed of brick, the warehouse was described by Thomas Dixon as second to none in appearance in the Commonwealth. The building is symmetrically composed and uses materials which were uncommon for factory buildings of the period. It is Georgian Revival in style, with details including sills, banding and dressings picked out in dark blue salt glazed bricks. The roof was originally covered with diagonally laid asbestos-cement slates which were developed in France and not imported to Australia until . They were not manufactured in Australia until after the First World War. The slates survive under the present super-six sheeting. The front elevation features windows with arched glazing bars, whilst the fanlight above the door features scalloped glazing bars. The remainder of the windows were originally nine paned in rows of three which pivoted inwards or outwards, however most were replaced with sheet glass or glass louvres in 1983. Internally, the ground floor originally consisted of an office and storerooms which were located at the southern end of the building. A brick fire wall divided them from the larger area which housed the workroom. The first floor was similarly divided, with the southern end housing a warehouse for finished shoes and a small showroom. The remainder of the first floor contained presses to cut uppers and an area for sewing the uppers. The engine room was located in a single storey building attached to the eastern side of the main building and the original gas engine which drove power shafts suspended beneath the first floor was replaced with an electric motor . This method of power was replaced by self-contained sewing machines . Staff pictured outside Dixons Shoe Factory, West End The new factory was in close proximity to residential dwellings, indicative of the nineteenth century/early twentieth century practice of workers living close to their place of employment. It appears that Thomas Dixon also resided in West End upon his arrival in Brisbane, and the Post Office Directories record him residing near the factory from 1883 until his death in 1909. After Dixon's death, the business continued under the management of his sons, one of whom managed the shoe factory whilst the other managed the tannery. Additional buildings were constructed on the site, including a store for wooden lasts constructed prior to 1920, an air raid shelter constructed during the Second World War, and an addition to the south western corner of the factory comprising air conditioned office and showroom, constructed in 1965, all of which survive on the site. A staff amenities block and garage were also constructed, however these no longer survive. The company of T C Dixon and Sons continued to operate from the West End factory until 1973 when they sold the factory to K D Morris and moved to new and larger premises at Wacol. In 1975, the building was purchased by the Queensland Government and used as a store until 1991 when it became the home of the Queensland Ballet and the Queensland Philharmonic Orchestra after undergoing a $1.8 million refurbishment.  Description  Drake Street entrance, 2015 The Dixon Centre is a substantial two storey brick building, rectangular in plan with a super six asbestos-cement roof covering the original roof of asbestos- cement slates. The site is bounded by Montague Road and Drake and Raven Streets, along which are located a substantial brick fence (which becomes a retaining wall in places) surmounted by regularly spaced brick piers. The timber picket fence which original enclosed the space between the piers is no longer extant. Also located on the site is the store for the Queensland Ballet props (formerly the store for wooden lasts), the engine house, air raid shelter and 1965 brick addition to the main building. The main building is located at the front of the site with the long axis following the Montague Road boundary. The foundations and ground floor are constructed of concrete which support load bearing walls of plain red machine-made bricks laid in English bond pattern. Attached buttresses are evenly spaced along the walls on the long axis, and sills, dressings and banding at the first floor and sill levels and are highlighted with dark blue salt glazed bricks. Two sets of new metal fire stairs are located on the eastern side of the building. A single storey brick air raid shelter is located on the eastern side of the main building, the top of which is used as an outdoor seating area opening from the former engine room, now a kitchenette. The 1965 brick showroom at the southwestern corner also survives. The front entrance, facing Drake Street is symmetrically composed, with a centrally located doorway flanked by windows on either side. The doorway features a pair of five panel bolection moulded doors, surmounted by a fanlight with scalloped glazing bars. The windows to the ground level have arched headers, and they and the entrance are surrounded by dark blue salt glazed voussoirs set out in the manner of a Gibbs surround. A sandstone tablet above the entrance is relief carved with the words \\"ESTABLISHED 1873\\". The original nine paned windows to the first floor have been replaced with single panes of sheet glass and have flat arches of dark blue salt glazed voussoirs. The rear elevation, facing Raven Street is similarly composed to the front elevation, but with a less decorative central doorway and rectangular windows featuring three vertical rows of glass louvres to both floors. Each of the side elevations are also symmetrically composed with a regular fenestration pattern. All windows to the side and rear elevation have three vertical rows of glass louvres with flat arches of dark blue salt glazed voussoirs. The brick fire wall is evident approximately one third from the Drake Street end of the building. It divides both the walls and the hipped roof which has ventilators evenly spaced along its ridge. Internally, the space is divided into offices around a central corridor on the ground floor and four practice rooms, three of which are interconnecting, on the first floor. Stairs are internally located both centrally and at the northern end on the Montague Road side of the building. The former engine room is now utilised as a kitchenette. The first floor practice rooms have exposed king post trusses which span the width of the building.. Evidence of the original use and form of the building includes a piece of equipment suspended within the roof trusses of the practice room at the southern end, hardwood columns in the reception space and exposed brick walls to some areas and an early fire system in the entrance. A timber framed weatherboard building with a saw tooth roof is located in the south-eastern corner of the site. It is now used as a store for the Queensland Ballet and is an open space divided by wire mesh screens. The walls are unlined and the floor is timber. Light is provided by windows on the side elevations and on the vertical planes of the saw tooth roof.  Heritage listing  Thomas Dixon Centre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 October 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1908 as a shoe and boot manufacturing factory, the Thomas Dixon Centre provides evidence of an early Brisbane industry which is now obsolete. Surrounded by residential dwellings, the location of the factory demonstrates the former practice of workers to live close to their place of employment. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Thomas Dixon Centre provides evidence of early manufacturing industries in Queensland. The significance of the building is further enhanced as few buildings providing evidence of early manufacturing industries survive in Brisbane. The Thomas Dixon Centre is a rare surviving example of an early twentieth century industrial factory in West End and demonstrates the principal characteristics of a building of its type through its form and use of materials. It also incorporates unusually decorative features for a building of its type, such as feature brickwork and decorative glazing bars to the front windows. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

It also incorporates unusually decorative features for a building of its type, such as feature brickwork and decorative glazing bars to the front windows. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is a landmark within the streetscape due to its scale and elevated location. The symmetrical design and repetitive fenestration pattern, as well as details including the decorative windows to the front elevation and the use of dark blue salt glazed bricks contribute to the aesthetic significance of the place. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As the headquarters of both the Queensland Ballet and the Queensland Philharmonic Orchestra since 1991, the Thomas Dixon Centre has strong associations with these particular cultural groups and the community of West End. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Centre has strong association with the Dixon Family who held a high reputation in Brisbane as a \\"family\\" company with management providing good working conditions for their staff. The place also has special association with architect Richard Gailey, as an example of his work.

It is a bicyclic molecule consisting of two cis-fused cyclopropane rings, and is a colorless and easily condensed gas. Bicyclobutane is noted for being one of the most strained compounds that is isolatable on a large scale -- its strain energy is estimated at 63.9 kcal mol‚àí1. It is a nonplanar molecule, with a dihedral angle between the two cyclopropane rings of 123¬∞. The first reported bicyclobutane was the carboxyethyl derivative, C4H5CO2Et, which was prepared by dehydrohalogenation the corresponding bromocyclobutanecarboxylate ester with sodium hydride. The parent hydrocarbon was prepared from 1-bromo-3-chlorocyclobutane by conversion of the bromocyclobutanecarboxylate ester, followed by intramolecular Wurtz coupling using molten sodium. The intermediate 1-bromo-3-chlorocyclobutane can also be prepared via a modified Hunsdiecker reaction from 3-chlorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid using mercuric oxide and bromine: :300px A synthetic approach to bicyclobutane derivatives involves ring closure of a suitably substituted 2-bromo-1-(chloromethyl)cyclopropane with magnesium in THF. Stereochemical evidence indicates that bicyclobutane undergoes thermolysis to form 1,3-butadiene with an activation energy of 41 kcal mol‚àí1 via a concerted pericyclic mechanism (cycloreversion, [œÉ2s+œÉ2a]).  Biological synthesis  Multiple research groups have reported success in synthesizing bicyclobutane- containing molecules using enzymes in living cells. One group reported the transformation of linolenic acid into a bicyclobutane fatty acid via a protein produced by a strain of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (strain PCC 7120). The other group reported a directed evolution approach, whereby engineered heme protein was expressed in E. coli and successfully optimized for increased rate and yield of biosynthesis of a substituted bicyclobutane derivative.

It was built . It is also known as Greyscourt and Byanda. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Collins Place was constructed in 1889 or 1890 for Ship Inn proprietor Michael Foley, on land he acquired in 1887. Around the same time Foley also built the neighbouring semi-detached houses of Greyscourt and Beth Eden, which later became known conjointly as Grays Court. Foley's houses were erected during the boom which transformed Grey Street, South Brisbane's principal residential street since the mid 1840s, into a fashionable address. From 1890 until the early 1910s it was occupied by respected Brisbane surgeon Francis Glynn Connolly who called the house Byanda. It passed from the Foley family in 1928, but remained a rental property through subsequent ownerships. Lynette Bloss, who purchased the property in 1983 and renovated the building, unsuccessfully appealed against its resumption by the Expo Authority in 1984. Ms Bloss bestowed the name Collins Place to commemorate 1857 deed of grant holder, squatter John Collins. During Expo '88 the building functioned as Collins Place Spaghetti House. At the time of the building's heritage listing in 1992, it was in use as a police station. The precinct around Collins Place was redeveloped in 2013-14 with a major residential, commercial and hotel development named \\"Southpoint\\" being built around the historic building. Collins Place has been retained as a focal point for the development, and will house a restaurant or tavern when complete. However, the redevelopment of the site involved raising the property by nine metres which occurred in December 2014.  Description  Collins Place, 2009 Collins Place is a two-and-a-half storeyed rendered brick building with pitched corrugated iron roofs situated on a slope which falls away from the adjacent Southbank railway station (formerly Vulture Street railway station). Fronting Grey Street at its south- eastern end, Collins Place currently stands without immediate neighbours on either side. The building is L-shaped, with a service wing to the rear, and has verandahs on three sides to two levels. It has a hipped roof linking to a gabled roof running over the service wing. The street-facing gable projects and is decorated with a finial and cross pieces. Chimneys with double clay pots rise above the roof line. The verandah has a skillion roof. Externally- exposed walls have been painted, while those sheltered by the verandah are unpainted, and show light-coloured splayed brick lintels, stone sills, and darker face brickwork. The building has timber sash windows, French doors opening onto the second level verandahs, tripartite windows facing the street to the first floor level, and flat arches to window heads on second floor level. It sits on a rendered masonry base which has intricate brick and iron ventilators. The verandahs are supported on timber columns with bevelled corners and square capitals, and have cast-iron valances and balustrading. Louvred timber spandrels run beneath the first floor verandah. Internally, the building comprises rooms either side of a central corridor and stairs, with the two-storeyed service wing being accessed from the rear. It is entered from street level via timber stairs which arrive at the first floor verandah; there are also timber service stairs to the rear. The house retains some earlier detailing, including pressed metal ceilings on the first floor, timber stairs with a richly detailed balustrade and timber panelling, and deep cedar skirtings and reveals. Collins Place retains the form, some of the internal and much of the external picturesque detailing of a turn of the century townhouse. In its new context it is a fragment of a former streetscape.

Like The Fog Warning and Breezing Up, he created it during his time in Maine. It is on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Viewers are presented a struggle of elements between the sea and the rocky shore. Winslow Homer excelled in painting landscape paintings that depicted seascapes and mountain scenery. Background and description After extensive travel, Homer settled in Prouts Neck, Maine. He had a studio built for him, which was completed in 1884, and painted marine subjects, including the hard lives of the fishermen and their families. He increasingly chose to depict the sea itself, and was especially attracted to stormy seas. During this period he painted a wide array of seascapes such as The Gulf Stream (1899), Moonlight ‚Äì Wood's Island Light (1886), Northeaster (1895) and Early Morning After a Storm at Sea (1902). Many of his paintings depict the battlefront of the sea and the shore, and the waves crashing onto the rocky shore. It has been said that they \\"are among the strongest expressions in all art of the power and dangerous beauty of the sea\\". Northeaster shows the waves while the Northeaster blows. Northeasters are storms along the upper East Coast of the United States that derive their name from the direction of the wind as it rotates onto land. The painting dates from 1895, but Homer reworked it by 1901. Provenance Northeaster was at M. Knoedler and Company of New York in 1895 and then in 1895‚Äì96 with Thomas B. Clarke, also in New York. It was then returned to Homer in Maine. In 1900 it was again with Knoedler. From 1901 to 1910 it was owned by George A. Hearn, also of New York, who gave it to the Metropolitan Museum.

He and his wife Corley, married since 2010, attend St. Ann Catholic Parish Roman Catholic Church in Coppell.  Political career  In 2012, Rinaldi placed third in the Republican primary election for the House District 115 seat. On March 4, 2014 the one-term incumbent, Bennett Ratliff, narrowly lost re-nomination to Rinaldi, who received 4,167 votes (50.6 percent) to Ratliff's 4,075 votes (49.4 percent). Rinaldi's 2014 campaign received support from the Tea Party movement, Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, Texas Eagle Forum and Texas Right to Life, among others. In the Republican primary held on March 1, 2016, incumbent Rinaldi held off the challenge from Ratliff who tried unsuccessfully to regain his seat. The voters favored Rinaldi, 8,804 to 7,668 (53.45 to 46.55 percent). Rinaldi narrowly held on to his House seat in the general election held on November 8, 2016. He polled 29,987 votes (50.9 percent) to 28,939 (49.1 percent) for the Democrat Dorotha M. Ocker. = 84th legislative session = During the 84th legislative session, Rinaldi served on the Agriculture & Livestock committee and the Business & Industry committee. He joint- and co- authored successful pieces of legislation that were signed into law, including: HB 11 (authorizing additional troopers for border security and strengthening smuggling laws), and HB 283 (increasing government transparency by requiring certain governmental bodies to make audio and video recordings of open meetings available online). Rinaldi fought to eliminate or minimize the effects of the Robin Hood plan on Texas public school districts with HB 945 and HB 1411. Rinaldi co-authored legislation that would repeal in-state tuition and end welfare benefits for undocumented immigrants as well as penalize businesses that knowingly hire undocumented immigrants. Rinaldi was rated the number one conservative in the Texas House by a Rice University study that drew on the 1,138 non-lopsided roll call votes taken during the 2015 regular session. He received a 100 percent rating which tied him in the number one spot on the Texans for Fiscal Responsibility index with seven other conservative members. He was also the top-rated Representative by the Texas Eagle Forum with a 98% rating. Rinaldi had a 100 percent record on the Texas Right to Life scorecard and was designated by the organization as one of 14 \\"Pro-life Heroes\\" in the legislature for his work in passing pro-life legislation. = 85th legislative session = During the 85th legislative session, Rinaldi served on the Agriculture & Livestock committee and the Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence committee. Rinaldi was, according to the Dallas Morning News, \\"instrumental in strengthening the punishments in the sanctuary cities ban,\\" and authored and passed into law measures that: remove from office public officials who adopt sanctuary city policies, require government contractors and subcontractors to use e-verify, revoke pensions of teachers convicted of committing sex crimes against students, allow churches to utilize volunteers to provide security services without risking heavy fines, and prohibit any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood. He also re-introduced legislation he had previously proposed to end the Robin Hood school finance system. He served as the Pro-Life Whip for Texas Right to Life. Rinaldi also co-founded the Texas Freedom Caucus during the 85th legislative session. The caucus was founded by members of the House of Representatives committed to protecting life, strengthening family values, defending the Texas and U.S. Bill of Rights, restraining government and revitalizing personal and economic freedoms. In May 2017, Rinaldi called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers on protesters inside the Capitol building. Rinaldi claimed that he called ICE after seeing individuals holding protest signs indicating they were illegal immigrants. An altercation ensued; according to multiple Hispanic Democratic lawmakers, Rinaldi got into their faces during the dispute and cursed at them. Video shot from the House floor showed both Republicans and Democrats pushing each other. Rinaldi claimed that Representative Poncho Nev√°rez threatened his life during the incident, which Nev√°rez denied. Democratic lawmaker Justin Rodriguez claimed that Rinaldi threatened to \\"put a bullet in one of my colleagues‚Äô heads\\"; Rinaldi did not deny making the statement, but claimed it was made in self defense. Rinaldi‚Äôs actions were widely seen as having a racial motivation. After the incident, state representative Ramon Romero Jr. said Rinaldi had \\"racially profiled every single person that was in the gallery today.\\" During Rinaldi's second term, he remained ranked as the most conservative legislator (tied with Briscoe Cain and Jonathan Stickland) in Austin according to a Rice University's study roll-call vote analysis drawing on 1,460 non-lopsided roll- call votes taken during the 2017 regular session. He was also named one of the Top 10 Legislators by Empower Texans, as well as one of the Top 10 Worst Legislators by Texas Monthly. His voting record earned a 100 score from Texans for Fiscal Responsibility. = 86th legislative session campaign = Rinaldi lost his state House seat in 2018 in the Democratic tide that swept Dallas County. Rinaldi was unseated by Democrat Julie Johnson, whose campaign included volunteers that Rinaldi had called ICE on in May 2017 at the Texas Capitol. Receiving 24,512 votes (43.21 percent) versus Johnson's 32,214 votes (56.79 percent), Rinaldi received the lowest vote percentage of any House incumbent in Dallas County.

It was built in the 1860s. It is also known as The Grange. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Coorooman, a single-storeyed timber residence with attic and basement, was constructed by , when it was known as Grange House. Materials and stylistic details suggest it was erected much earlier, probably in the 1860s. Portion 147, a 9-acre parcel which included the Grange House site, was alienated in 1856 by Thomas Blacket Stephens. Portion 147 was part of approximately - most of the land between what is now Stephen's Road and Gladstone Road, and from Vulture Street to Gloucester Street - alienated by TB Stephens at this period. Stephens erected the first Cumbooquepa (Somerville House) on this land, and may have erected Grange House as well, which would account for its northern orientation to Vulture Street. Stephens subdivided portion 147 about 1863, and title to the Grange House site of (subdivisions 16 and 17), fronting the newly created Water Street West to the south and overlooking the Brisbane River to the north, was transferred to Helen Bell and her sister Ann Paton Love, in April 1863. The Love family retained title to this property until the late 1870s, but do not appear to have lived there. In 1882 title passed to Janet Burns, and she and her husband John were resident at Grange House by the following year. He was a merchant in business with his brother, James, who established the trading and mercantile firm of Burns, Philp & Co. Ltd in 1883. John Burns died in 1884, but Grange House remained the property of the Burns family until 1912, during which time it was mostly rented to middle class tenants. Lionel Clive Ball acquired the property in 1912, and renamed the house Coorooman. Ball became chief government geologist in 1931 and pioneered the geological mapping of Queensland based on aerial photography. The Ball family held the property until 1956. Coorooman remains a substantially intact, mid-19th century residence.  Description  Coorooman is a substantial timber residence situated on a ridge at South Brisbane overlooking the Brisbane River. The house is oriented to the north and Vulture Street, but from at least 1865, the site has been accessed from Dorchester Street to the south. The core is rectangular in form, with an encircling verandah, a highly pitched gabled-roof (originally shingled but now clad with corrugated iron), attic rooms and a brick basement. Parts of the verandah have been enclosed. Decorative elements include scalloped barge boards, turned finials with twisted lightning conductors, distinctive arched dormer windows, turned cedar verandah balusters and two classically moulded chimney heads. Internally, much of the original cedar joinery survives. There are four rooms on the main floor and another four rooms in the attic. These are lit by windows in the dormers and in the gable ends. The brick foundations contain two large basement rooms, one of which was used as LC Ball's photographic darkroom. To the southeast of the main building is a formerly detached timber wing containing kitchen and staff quarters. The grounds contain part of an early slab fence, and plantings include a Norfolk Island pine thought to date to .  Heritage listing  Coorooman was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Coorooman, erected by , is significant historically for its association with the mid-19th century expansion of middle-class residential settlement on the ridges of South Brisbane, overlooking the Brisbane River. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It remains substantially intact, and is an important example of an early gothic-style house in Brisbane. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Coorooman occupies a prominent position, and is important as one of Brisbane's commanding hilltop houses which contributes significantly to the townscape of South Brisbane.

Legend: 1. Tel≈°iai, 2. ≈†iauliai, 3. Kaunas, 4. Alytus,5. Grodno, 6. Osowiec, 7. Zambr√≥w, 8. Brest, 9. Kovel, 10. Volodymyr-Volynskyi, 11. Kamianka-Buzka, 12. Rava-Ruska, 13. Przemy≈õl A fortified district or fortified region (, ukreplyonny raion, ukrepraion) in the military terminology of the Soviet Union, is a territory within which a complex system of defense fortifications was engineered. Each fortified district consisted of a large number of concrete bunkers (pillboxes) armed with machineguns, antitank guns and artillery. The bunkers were built in groups for mutual support, each group forming a centre of resistance. The area in between was filled with various barriers and obstacles, as well as mine fields. A dedicated military unit (Fortified district troops) was permanently assigned to man each region. The concept of ukrepraions was developed during the Russian Civil War, when large territories were to be defended by relatively sparse military force. The first military units named so appeared in 1923. In 1928 the program for the construction of the comprehensive system of fortified districts was launched. It started with 13 fortified districts, which over time evolved into the Stalin Line.  Field Fortified Regions  Beginning in early 1942, long after the fortified lines in the west had fallen, the Red Army began organizing a somewhat different sort of unit, also known as a \\"Field\\" Fortified Region (District). These were brigade-sized in terms of manpower (apx. 4,500 men), with anywhere between four and eight machine gun - artillery battalions, a signal company, a medium mortar company, and other supporting units. They were not tied to any fortified line and had some, mostly horse-drawn, mobility, so are sometimes referred to as \\"field\\" units, as opposed to the pre-war units, which were static. In effect, as Soviet production of heavy weapons vastly increased in the middle part of the war, while manpower was hard put to keep pace, the men of the fortified regions were almost entirely trained as heavy weapon crews, in order to hold ground by firepower rather than by manpower. This was a very practical solution, given that so much of the Soviet-German front was impracticable for offensive action by either side. The new field fortified regions were most extensively employed during Operation Ring. Don Front was outnumbered by the German forces of 4th Panzer and 6th Armies, but those armies were in no position to attack to break the siege due to lack of supplies. Don Front employed six field fortified regions, 54th, 115th, 156th, 77th, 118th, and 159th, to protect and cover wide swaths of the encirclement front, enabling the field armies of the Front to concentrate the bulk of their combat forces in narrow, carefully selected main attack sectors. This use of fortified regions in an economy of force role proved so successful that the Red Army routinely employed them in the same fashion, but on an even larger scale, for the remainder of the war.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, p. 432  After World War II  Of the 47 fortified regions in the Red Army at the end of World War II, more than 30 were used to form machine gun artillery brigades and the rest were disbanded. By the 1950s the fortified regions in the Far East had been disbanded, and only a few remained in the Transcaucasus and Karelia, using different TO&Es; from the World War II units. As Sino-Soviet tensions increased during the 1960s, the Soviet Army began to create new fortified regions to provide security in the Far East. The first two, the 97th and 114th, were formed in March 1966 to protect the Transbaikal railways. Each included three motor rifle battalions with four companies each, four tank battalions with four companies equipped with T-34-85, IS-2, IS-3, IS-4, T-54/T-55, and OT-55 tanks. The units also included a separate machine gun artillery battalion of six companies, two of which were equipped with ten OT-55 and IS-4, and separate sapper, communications, repair and recovery battalions, as well as an anti- tank battalion with 18 85 mm guns and a rocket artillery battery with 4 BM-13 Katyusha units. By the late 1980s, ten fortified regions were located in the Primorsky and Amur regions, five in the Transbaikal, one in Kazakhstan, and four on the Turkish border. The organization of each fortified region differed according to the needs of their respective military districts. However, each fortified region generally included between three and five separate machine gun artillery battalions (with some additionally including a motor rifle battalion), a tank battalion and between one and three battalions or companies of tank turrets dug in as pillboxes, one to three artillery battalions or separate batteries (including rocket and anti-tank), an anti-aircraft rocket battalion or battery, a separate communications battalion or company, an engineer-sapper battalion, company, or platoon, and support and maintenance units. The machine gun artillery battalions of the fortified regions differed little in their organization, usually consisting of two machine gun companies, a motor rifle company, and a mortar battery. Depending on their location, they could also consist of a company of tank turrets dug in as pillboxes, two or three artillery caponiers, and a ZPU-2 anti-aircraft gun platoon. Machine gun companies consisted of three platoons each armed with six PK and PKS 12.7 mm machine guns, the 12.7 mm NSV heavy machine gun, the AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher, and the SPG-9 anti-tank grenade launcher. The motor rifle units of the fortified regions had a similar structure to other motor rifle units and were mostly equipped with ZIL-131 and GAZ-66 trucks. The tank battalions numbered 31 tanks, generally T-54s or T-55s and sometimes including OT-55 flamethrower tanks. Separate rocket battalions were equipped with 18 BM-21 Grad or BM-13 systems, six per battery; anti-tank batteries were equipped with six 100 mm MT-12 anti-tank guns. During the fall and winter of 1989, during the reorganization of the Soviet Army, most of the fortified regions were reorganized into machine gun artillery regiments of newly created machine gun artillery divisions.

It premiered on March 31, 2016. A family unravels during a bloody, berserk summer as when a horrifying plague transforms a small town into the flesh-eating walking dead,  Plot  A family of four, Dino, his wife Pernille, and their children the young Maj and teenaged Gustav are living in idyllic Sorgenfri, Denmark during the summer. Pernille dotes on Maj, who in turn dotes on her pet rabbit, Ninos. Another teen, Sonja, moves in with her mother across the street, much to Gustav's interest. At a picnic one of the neighbors, Casper, tries to persuade Dino to get a gun so they can go hunting together, but Dino refuses. Meanwhile, some picnickers begin showing signs of disease. An elderly neighbor reports her husband has died, but upon investigation his body has gone missing. Over the course of several days, the situation escalates as a deadly virus that reanimates its hosts into hostile killing machines sweeps the neighborhood, but Dino lies to the children assuring them that everything is alright. Sorgenfri is then quarantined by the military which orders all residents to self-isolate. The military keeps the families supplied but each house is kept strictly incommunicado, hermetically sealed with plastic sheets, and the power frequently fails. During the night some of the neighbors are dragged from their homes and placed in the back of trucks in a brutal purge, and many are shot. Gustav, having snuck out, witnesses this while spying on Sonja and, in a burst of fervor, frees the infected. The military is quickly overrun and retreats, abandoning everyone to their fate. Sonja and her infected mother are taken in at Gustav's insistence against Pernille's protests. As zombies overrun the neighborhood, Casper's significant other Anna is finally able to flee after having made several attempts. Abandoned, Casper joins Dino and prepares for a siege while Sonja's mother grows progressively sicker and Ninos has gone missing. The infected begin roaming the night and Gustav's habit of peeping with the lights on nearly gets them all killed. Anna eventually returns, thoroughly traumatized. Sonja and Gustav have a romantic interlude as Sonja's mom's condition rapidly deteriorates. When Sonja wakes up in her mother's embrace, she slowly realizes that her mother is in full rigor mortis. Dino and Casper scout the area, finding an abandoned landscape, except for dead neighbors, surrounded by a wall. After fair warning, and almost refusing to budge, Dino and Casper are fired upon by the military and forced back. Gustav and Sonja are caught red- handed by Pernille, and they discover Maj is missing. Gustav and Sonja go outside to find corpses in the street while, despite his posturing, Casper is killed. Dino then robs a woman of her meager supplies at rifle point.. Maj, having previously snuck out to find Ninos, is quickly bitten but then rescued by her family. The gunshot attracts a horde and the family retreats. Previous preparations to the house prove adequate against the approaching zombies for the time being. Dino finally decides to put a bullet into Maj's brain. Pernille fights him but she is bitten. Dino then hesitates and proves incapable of destroying what used to be his daughter. Gustav uses fireworks to distract the zombies, although forgetting to take any extra with him, but nonetheless succeeds in escaping with Sonja just ahead of a nuclear blast which sterilizes the area.

Biography Egill Helgason began his career in journalism in print media, in newspapers such as T√≠minn and Helgarp√≥sturinn. He studied journalism in Paris in 1986-1987, at the international Journalistes en Europe. In 1988 Egill Helgason started moving into television, first with a series on different aspects of Icelandic nationality called Mannlegi √æ√°tturinn. Later he became a reporter at R√öV, the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service, and later at the independent St√∂√∞ 2. In 1999 Egill Helgason started a political talk show called Silfur Egils at a newly founded television station called Skj√°r einn. The show quickly became very popular and influential, with Helgason interviewing guests both in Icelandic and English, and occasionally in other languages. In 2007 the show moved to St√∂√∞ 2 due to differences with the owners of Skj√°r einn. In 2007 Silfur Egils moved again, now to R√öV. During the Icelandic economic crash it became a center of the heated debates going on in the country, with Egill also inviting foreign guests such as the French prosecutor Eva Joly to his show, Nobel prize winning economists such as Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz and social critics Noam Chomsky and Slavoj Zizek, as well as Julian Assange, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Carl Bildt. At R√öV Egill Helgason also started a television show on books, named Kiljan. It is a weekly program on books, blending literary criticism and interviews with authors. Among noted authors who have appeared on the show are Michel Houellebecq, Dave Eggers, David Mitchell, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Nawal El Saadawi, Alice Walker and Dan Brown. Kiljan has been running since 2007. Egill Helgason has made documentary series on historical subjects. Vesturfarar (Westward Bound, 2014) was a ten part series on the Icelandic emigration to Canada and the US from 1873 to 1914. Steinsteypu√∂ldin (The Age of Concrete, 2016) is in five parts, recounting how Reykjav√≠k was built after a terrible fire in 1915 which devastated the center of town, than mainly built from timber. Kaupmannah√∂fn, h√∂fu√∞borg √çslands (Copenhagen, capital of Iceland, 2017) is the story of the long relationship between Iceland and Copenhagen, for a long time the de facto capital of the country. Egill Helgason is presently working on a series called Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, saga b√¶jar (Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, the story of a town). It recounts how an isolated village in the north of Iceland became a great hub of activity, creating great riches, due to herring fishing which took off in 1903, and than the subsequent crash when the herring finally disappeared in 1967. Egill Helgason has won numerous Eddas, annual awards given by The Icelandic Film and Television Academy. Helgason has been active on the internet since February 2000 when he started a blog on a now defunct website called Striki√∞. Helgason has since kept on blogging, later on V√≠sir, Eyjan and now on a webside called DV/Eyjan. He writes about different topics, politics, international affairs, literature, history, travel and music ‚Äì which is another passion of Egill. He has also written a lot about Greece, being a noted philellene who spends time in Greece every year.

It is one of the pioneering companies in the space of automatic text generation, and when it floated on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in December 2013, it was valued at over ¬£160 million. However, Arria was later delisted from the stock exchanged as the company moved from the UK to Australia. Arria's technology is based on three decades of scientific research in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG).  History  The company was founded in 2009 under the name Data2Text Limited by Professor Ehud Reiter, Senior Lecturer Dr Yaji Sripada, and post-doctoral researcher Dr Ross Turner from the NLG research group at the University of Aberdeen, and meteorologist/entrepreneur Ian Davy. In May 2012, Data2Text joined forces with a specialist software development and marketing firm, Arria NLG (then a limited company), which took a 20% stake in Data2Text. In late 2013, Arria NLG acquired the remaining 80% of Data2Text, and in December 2013 Arria NLG converted to a public listed company and was floated on the AIM.  Technology/Science  \\"The fundamental goal of the technology is to take large quantities of data, identify the key information contained in that data, and express that information in natural language text or voice,\\" says Dr Robert Dale, the company's Chief Technology Officer. To reach this goal, the Arria NLG Engine, a cloud-based enterprise software platform, automatically recognises patterns in large volumes of complex data, which are then distilled into a narrative description of the most significant information. The NLG Engine consists of two components: * The analysis and interpretation component takes raw transactional or sensor data and turns it into information using rules based on the knowledge of a domain expert. * The NLG component communicates this information in natural language, based on general linguistic rules augmented with industry-specific terminology and usage. Arria NLG's capabilities are rooted in the scientific research conducted since the 1980s by its founder and Chief Scientist, Professor Ehud Reiter, and Chief Technology Officer Dr Robert Dale. In June 2014, Arria NLG's technology was awarded US patents 8,762,133 and 8,762,134. Among Arria's founders are Professor Ehud Reiter and Dr Yaji Sripada, both currently teaching and researching in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Aberdeen. Reiter, Arria's Chief Scientist, holds a PhD from Harvard and founded the NLG research group in Aberdeen, one of the world's most renowned research groups on Natural language generation. Dr Robert Dale joined Arria as Chief Strategy Scientist and CTO after 17 years as professor in the Department of Computing at Macquarie University, where he was director of the now defunct Microsoft Research Institute and later the Centre for Language Technology. From 2003 to 2014, Dale was editor in chief of Computational Linguistics, the leading journal in the field of Natural Language Processing. In 2000, Reiter and Dale co-authored the seminal textbook Building Natural Language Generation Systems.  Applications  Data2Text Limited originally focussed on automatically producing meteorological reports based on numerical weather forecast data, but quickly extended its offerings to the conversion of vast amounts of data from oil and gas platforms into natural language reports for engineers and operators, with the UK's Met Office and Shell US being among its main clients. More recently, Arria NLG has signed a contract with FarmLink to produce narrative reports to optimise agricultural yield potential, as well as a proof-of-concept agreement to provide data intelligence to aircraft engine maintenance staff. The group is also developing applications providing automatic analysis and reporting capabilities for fraud detection, risk mitigation and compliance to the banking industry.  Competitors  Other companies who operate in the NLG space include Automated Insights, a firm based in Durham, North Carolina, Chicago-based Narrative Science, and Yseop, Inc, a European firm headquartered in Dallas, Texas, as well as Linguastat from San Francisco, California, United Robots from Sweden and Retresco, based in Berlin, Germany.

The story involves a Daoist monk and is interpreted through the Daoist and Buddhist belief of life as an illusion and the moral of not striving too much in one's life. Plot The story begins with a Daoist monk called L√º travelling when he meets a man named Lu. This man is unhappy with his life and laments that he was a great man born at the wrong time. The monk responds asking him if his life is not happy then whose life could possibly be happy. Lu monologues that a good and happy life ought to have a certain level of prestige, wealth, and glory, and immediately after he finishes speaking he falls into a deep slumber. The monk offers Lu a blue porcelain pillow on which to sleep. The pillow had an opening on each end. While the man slept he entered the pillow. Inside the pillow the man was married to a wealthy family and a beautiful wife and became quite rich. He was appointed to be chancellor to the emperor during a time of war, as well. But soon afterwards his colleagues became jealous and started spreading rumors that Lu was a traitor; the rumors caused an edict that he should be imprisoned. Upon his capture he told his wife that he had been afflicted to have wanted such a large salary that he should deserve such a fate. He grew old inside the pillow and upon his dying breath wrote a memorandum about his life and divine fate explaining that his strife was in vain. When he died an old man inside the pillow he then awoke in an inn with the Daoist monk. He proclaims that it may have been a dream and the monk responds that \\"the happinesses of human life are all like that.\\" Themes The Tang Dynasty was an open system with many religious influences including Buddhism and Daoism. Daoist themes are prevalent in the story. The Daoists believe in inaction-action and not striving to gain fortune, wealth, or status. This theme is evident in the moral of \\"The World Inside a Pillow\\" as the man Lu realizes that all of his strife was in vain. This theme is also argued to have Buddhist influence because the Buddhists also believe in ceasing desire which also has traces in the story. According to John Hawley the story is a forumulaic dream tale in which a religious teacher (Buddhist or Daoist) causes a mortal person to become enlightened through some type of dream. Other Related Works The Governor of Nanke referred as \\"The Governor of the Southern Tributary State‚Äù is a work that was regarded by the Chinese literary critic, Lu Xun, as a superior dream tale to \\"The World Inside a Pillow\\". The story was written in a similar time frame (also during the Tang Dynasty) and follows a similar story method in which the mortal falls asleep and the lines between dream and reality are blurred. The episode \\"Puhoy\\" of the American animated television series Adventure Time explores a similar story line when the show's main character Finn builds a giant pillow fort. While seemingly fallen asleep in it and dreaming, he ends up in a magical pillow world where he marries a pillow woman, grows old with a family and eventually dies. Unlike in the Chinese story, Finn later doesn't retain any memories to the happy life he experienced.

SCIM could be used to automatically add/delete (or, provision/de-provision) accounts for those users in external systems such as G Suite, Office 365, or Salesforce.com. Then, a new user account would exist in the external systems for each new employee, and the user accounts for former employees might no longer exist in those systems. In addition to simple user-record management (creating & deleting), SCIM can also be used to share information about user attributes, attribute schema, and group membership. Attributes could range from user contact information to group membership. Group membership or other attribute values are generally used to manage user permissions. Attribute values and group assignments can change, adding to the challenge of maintaining the relevant data across multiple identity domains. The SCIM standard has grown in popularity and importance, as organizations use more SaaS tools. A large organization can have hundreds or thousands of hosted applications (internal and external) and related servers, databases and file shares that require user provisioning. Without a standard connection method, companies must write custom software connectors to join these systems and their IdM system. SCIM uses a standardised API through REST with data formatted in JSON or XML. History The first version, SCIM 1.0, was released in 2011 by a SCIM standard working group organized under the Open Web Foundation. In 2011, it was transferred to the IETF, and the current standard, SCIM 2.0 was released as IETF RFC in 2015. SCIM 2.0 was completed in September 2015 and is published as IETF RFCs 7643 and 7644. A use-case document is also available as RFC 7642. The standard has been implemented in various IdM software. The standard was initially called Simple Cloud Identity Management (and is still called this in some places), but the name was officially changed to System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) when the IETF adopted it. Interoperability was demonstrated in October, 2011, at the Cloud Identity Summit, an IAM industry conference. There, user accounts were provisioned and de-provisioned across separate systems using SCIM standards, by a collection of IdM software vendors: Okta, Ping Identity, SailPoint, Technology Nexus and UnboundID. In March 2012, at IETF 83 in Paris, Interoperability tests continued by the same vendors, joined by Salesforce.com, BCPSoft, WSO2, Gluu, and Courion (now SecureAuth) - nine companies in total. SCIM is the second standard for exchanging user data, but it builds on prior standards (e.g. SPML, PortableContacts, vCards, and LDAP directory services) in an attempt to be a simpler and more widely adopted solution for cloud services providers. The SCIM standard is growing in popularity and has been adopted by numerous identity providers (e.g. Azure Active Directory) as well as applications (e.g. Dynamic Signal, Zscaler, and Dropbox). As adoption of the standard grows, so do the number of tools available to you. The standard leverages a number of open source libraries to facilitate development and testing frameworks ensure that endpoint compliance with the SCIM standard.

It is situated in the fork between the Helsing√∏r Motorway to the east, separating it from Esperg√¶rde, and Helsing√∏rsvej (part of National route 9) to the west. Kvistg√•rd station is a stop on the Litte North railway line between Helsing√∏r and Hiller√∏d. As of 2020, Kvistg√•rd has a population of 1,150BY3: Population 1 January by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark. History The first known reference to the village of Nyrup (Nuthorp) is in a letter from Pope Alexander III dated 2 November 1178. The village belonged to Esrum Abbey until the Reformation. In 1497 it consisted of 10 farms and in 1681 of six farms and four houses. From 1674 until 1712 the residence of the forester of Kronborg County was in Nyrup. After that he resided at Gurrehus. Before Fredensborg was built, the king also had a hunting lodge at Nyrup. It was located a little north of the village. Nyrup was located at the site where the two royal roads (kongeveje) from Frederiksborg and Hirschholm Palace met before continuing to Helsing√∏r and Kronborg. The village was therefore from at least the beginning of the 18th century and probably much earlier home to an inn. The area east of Kvistg√•rd station in 1928: Still open countryside Kvistg√•rd developed around Kvistg√•rd station which opened on the new North Line in 1868. The town was named after the farm Kvistg√•rd (formerly Qvistgaard) on whose land it was built. The farmhouse was subsequently referred to as Kvistg√•rd Hovedg√•rd (literally \\"Kvistg√•rd Manor\\") to distinguish it from the station and settlement even if it had never been a manor house. The land originally belonged to the hamlet of Munkegaarde but after the agricultural reforms of the 1780s came under Nyrup. The first new buildings were in a housing development built by the railway company for railway workers. In the mid-1870s, Ludvig Lichtenberg, owner of Kvistg√•rd Hovedg√•rd, established Kvistg√•rd Brickyards (Kvistg√•rd Teglv√¶rk). Havreholm Fabrikker A/S a manufacturer of wood products, moved to a new site next to Kvistg√•rd Station after a fire in 1897. When these enterprises closed, new companies took over their premises. The area remained relatively open until the middle of the 20th century but was gradually surrounded by residential neighbourhoods, workshops, a few shops and new industries. Landmarks Kvistg√•rd's former main building today houses the only Rudolf Steiner school in the North Zealand area. The buildings have been expanded and altered several times. All of the land has been sold off. Some of it has been laid out as allotments since 1975. Nyrup boasts two English-style country houses from the 1820s, Fairyhill and Claythorpe. They were built by Charles Fenwick, an English born businessman and General council. Fairyhill was listed in 1959. Nyrupgaard now houses the head office of the Noa Noa clothing company. Companies in Kvistg√•rd include Bavarian Nordic, the Barslund A/S construction and engineering company, Signal Clothing A/S and Insight Cosmetics Group. The nearest supermarket is Rema 1000 in Kvistg√•rd. The local parish church is in Tik√∏b. Surroundings Kvistg√•rd is surrounded by several small forests. Nyrup Hegn and Kronborg Hegn are located north of the town and Kelleris Hegn and Egebljsvang are to the west. Transport Kvistg√•rd is served by Kvistg√•rd station on the Little North Line between Helsing√∏r and Hiller√∏d. Trains are operated by the railway company Lokaltog with frequencies of twice an hour in the daytime on week days and once an hour in the evening and on weekends. The Helsing√∏r Motorway provides a fast connection to Copenhagen. Helsing√∏rsvej, part of National route 6, connects Kvistg√•rd to Fredensborg, Hiller√∏d, Slangerup, and Roskilde.

The aircraft was built in 1944 and delivered to the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) in the following year to serve in World War II. At the time, the P-51D was a major component of the USAAF fleet and Worry Bird escorted Allied bombers on long-range air raids in Germany. While the P-51 Mustang was a versatile aircraft used in many roles during the war, its role in European bombing missions was perhaps its most significant, and several historians and Air Force veterans believe the aircraft gave the Allies a decisive advantage in the European aerial theater. After World War II ended, Worry Bird served in the Korean War and at several Air Force bases before its retirement in 1957. It passed through multiple private owners over the following decades; in the early 1990s, Mike George restored the aircraft and moved it to its current base.

It was designed by Addison & MacDonald and built in 1929 by Albert Stonadge & Son. It is also known as Ng House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 May 2000.  History  The building was originally constructed as the South Brisbane branch of the Queensland National Bank. Constructed by local builders, A Stonadge and Son, to a design by Addison and MacDonald, the new premises at 39 Melbourne Street was opened for business on 31 July 1929. The land on which the building was to be constructed was one of thirty allotments sold in the Brisbane land boom of 1854. The Deed of Grant for the land was acquired on 11 May 1854 by William John Loudon. As it was situated within the town limits drawn up in 1846, the allotment was affected by each of the major urban developments on the South Brisbane peninsula such as the development of the public transport systems, the declaration of the first-class urban areas and the widening of the major arterial roads (Melbourne and Grey Streets). It was also one of the many areas inundated by the floods of the 1890s. Subdivision of the original blocks was underway by 1870 and allotment 1 section 15, of which this site is a part, was acquired by Patrick Maunsell on 3 March 1871. It was sold by Maunsell's widow in 1897 and passed through several hands until the site was acquired by Janet Mearns Pike and Richard Pike in 1912. The economic development of South Brisbane was reflected in the various properties which occupied the site prior to the construction of the bank in the late 1920s. These included boarding establishments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries which served the needs of workers and visitors to the city until 1917. The more diversified nature of commerce in the area from that time is reflected in the tenancy of the Pikes Building which was constructed by 1917. The State Department of Works leased the site in 1917 and various state offices including the Chief Protector of Aboriginals and the Department of Water Supply were situated there. In 1925, the whole of the site was resumed by the South Brisbane City Council. It passed to the Brisbane Municipal Council and, in 1927, part of the land was dedicated for road purposes. Resubdivision of the land followed and sub 3 of allotment 1 of section 15 was sold to the Queensland National Bank in September 1927. The Architecture and Building Journal of Queensland in July 1927 describes the \\"corner purchased by the Queensland National Bank as one of the gem positions of the whole business thoroughfare\\". Brisbane City Council approved a new building for the Queensland National Bank Ltd, Queen Street, Brisbane in October 1928. Architects advertised for tenders and in the A & B Journal of Queensland, 19 November 1928, advertised that Albert Stonadge and Son's tender had been successful. The building cost just over . From 22 May 1928, the bank had occupied temporary premises in the adjacent Trocadero Building in Melbourne Street. Situated on the corner of one of the three distinct shopping centres which developed in South Brisbane in the early twentieth century, Baynard's Corner Melbourne Street, the Queensland National Bank was ideally placed to capitalise on the industrial and commercial development on the South Brisbane Peninsula. The construction of the South Brisbane Branch of the Queensland National Bank may have reflected the determined drive by the Bank to increase its market share in Queensland and to acquire the custom of the importers and merchants of the cities. The business potential of the Queensland National Bank many not have benefited to the same extent as that of its rival from the major developments in transport in the area; however, its drive to acquire the business of merchants and importers may well have been served by the up-grading of transport facilities in the area. These included the relocation of the in-bound lane of the tramway from Stanley Street to Grey Street in 1918. From that time, all in-bound trams from West End, Dutton Park, Ipswich Road, Coorparoo, Greenslopes and Balmoral stopped at the Bayards corner intersection where the bank was situated. When the Melbourne Street railway station became the terminus for both the interstate line through Kyogle as well as the southside commuter services, access to potential clients would have been increased considerably. The South Brisbane branch was one of a number of suburban branches established in the 1920s. Its move into the area reflects the bank's optimism and confidence in the potential of the locale and its desire to capture a large slice of Queensland's financial markets - a confidence and desire which it apparently shared with its counterpart and rival, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia whose banking chambers adjoined. The building in both its aspect and architecture reflects both the optimism for the future and the competitive drive which several of the banks were exhibiting at this time. In July 1949, title passed from the Queensland National Bank to the National Bank of Australasia, who held the property until 1978, when the branch was closed. Title to the land changed several times until the property was purchased by the current owners in 1983. The former Queensland National Bank, South Brisbane Branch was identified as a Place of Contributory Significance in Brisbane City Council's 1993 Heritage Study of the South Brisbane, West End and Mater Hill areas. The Heritage Study was prepared as part of the South Brisbane Development Control Plan. In 2016, the building is occupied by accountancy company Roger Ng & Co and the building is known as Ng House.  Description  Structure in 2015 The former Queensland National Bank, South Brisbane Branch is a two storey rendered brick building with a corrugated iron roof partly concealed by a decorative, moulded parapet with a dentilled cornice. The building turns the corner between Melbourne and Grey Streets in three stages. Every change in angle occurs between a pair of pilasters. The eastern facade, along Grey Street, is divided into five bays by paired giant order pilasters. A paired, copper door is located along Grey Street topped by a classical entablature with a row of dentils. A similar entablature can be seen over a second entry at the right hand bay of the Grey Street frontage. The southern facade, along Melbourne Street is divided into two bays by pilasters. Double hung sash windows are located on both the ground and first floors. Recessed, square copper panels are placed between the upper and lower windows. Internally, the building has undergone refurbishments on both the ground and first floors. The entrance foyer has a decorative plaster ceiling and cornices. An archway with recent decorative timber work opens to a hallway from which offices open on each side. Original timber doors, with breezeway assembly, remain in offices along the eastern wall. The original strong room is located in the northwestern corner of the ground floor. A staircase, with a copper handrail, leads to the first floor landing which has an original cast iron railing. A downpipe has been retained in the southwestern wall on the first floor. The first floor offices are currently unoccupied.

The early years of his reign were comparatively free from Maratha and Mughal inroads but a dispute with Marwar (Jodhpur) on a point of honor brought the two states, which had worked closely during Maharaja Pratap Singh's time, into confrontation, which however ended in peace and a matrimonial alliance. An important event at the commencement of his reign was the signing of an offensive and defensive alliance on 12 December, 1803 with the British. This treaty was likely to free Jaipur from Maratha depredations, but after Lord Wellesley's departure, it was annulled by the Governor General, George Barlow who was an advocate of the policy of non- interference. As a result of this, territories of the state were depredated by the Maratha's and Amir Khan Pindari till the signing of the historic treaty of 1818 ‚Äòdefensive alliance, perpetual friendship, protection and subordinate cooperation‚Äô with the British. Barely nine months later Sawai Jagat Singh died at the young age of 32. Arts & Culture Like his father, Sawai Jagat Singh was also a patron of the arts and crafts. He was very much interested in sports as well as in literature. All the Karkhanas that have been thriving for long in Jaipur and came down to him as heritage were bursting with activities. Many Painters prospered in the Suratkhana, a number of paintings depicting Durbar scenes and Zenana Majlis were painted. Painter Sahib Ram painted a life size portrait of him.

Soviet forces were led by General Mikhail Tukhachevsky and General Nikolai Sollogub. Most of the Polish units, which participated in the battle, created the so-called First Assault Group (I Grupa Uderzeniowa), commanded by Pilsudski himself. The group consisted of the Third Army (Smigly-Rydz), and Fourth Army (Leonard Skierski). They concentrated in the area of Deblin, while the Second Assault Group under Wrzalinski, attacked from Warsaw, capturing Minsk Mazowiecki. Wrzalinski's group was supported by tanks. On August 12, 1920, a few days before the Wieprz river counteroffensive, Jozef Pilsudski came to Pulawy, to inspect the troops. On the next day he arrived at Deblin, meeting with Generals Smigly-Rydz and Skierski. During the meeting, Pilsudski presented to them his plan of the attack on the Soviet positions. Facing Soviet 16th Army and Mozyr Group, Pilsudski took command of the First Assault Group, locating his headquarters at the intersection of the roads from Deblin to Kock and from Warsaw to Lublin. On August 16, at 4 am, Pilsudski issued the order to attack. Polish objective was to reach the road connecting Warsaw with Brzesc nad Bugiem, in order to cut supply lines and evacuation routes of Soviet Western Front. Right wing of Polish advance was protected by the 3rd Infantry Division, which attacked along the line Wlodawa ‚Äì Brzesc. The First Assault Group managed to destroy Mozyr Group of the Red Army and southern wing of Soviet 16th Army. Simultaneously, Second Assault Group of Colonel Wrzalinski, concentrated near Wesola, attacked towards Minsk Mazowiecki, supported by Armoured Group of Major Nowicki (five tank units, three armoured trains, 10 airplanes). Colonel Wrzalinski and his soldiers began their offensive at 9 am. Divided into two columns, Poles advanced rapidly, crushing Soviet resistance with their tanks and artillery. 10th Rifle Division of the Red Army, which defended Debe Wielkie, abandoned its positions, and at app. 6 p.m. two Polish armoured trains entered the rail station at Minsk Mazowiecki, forcing the Soviets to retreat.

After the victorious battle of the Wkra river, units of Polish 5th Army (General Wladyslaw Sikorski), began their assault towards Przasnysz and Mlawa (August 18). Soviet 4th Army, which at that time occupied positions along the lower Vistula river, found itself in a difficult situation. As a result, on August 20 General Mikhail Tukhachevsky ordered his troops to concentrate in the area Ciechanow - Przasnysz - Makow Mazowiecki. The town of Przasnysz was of strategic importance to the Soviets, as the control of it enabled them to withdraw their forces eastwards, to Myszyniec and Kolno.

However, Rober Stern argues that much of his pro-reform stances derived from a tendency to acquiesce to British preferences in exchange for titles and honors, thus ensuring his seat of power. Between 1854 and 1855, the dewan and bakshi were given charge of revenue and army respectively. Subsequently, the duties of the prime minister lightened. During this period, Ram Singh established four new departments ‚Äì education, police, medical, and survey and settlement. In 1856, he built his own private secretariat. The kingdom was divided into five districts. Each district had a separate magistrate, judge, collector and police chief. In 1867, Ram Singh founded a Royal Council which consisted of eight members. To prevent any corrupt practices, two to three ministers were given charge of each portfolio. Ram Singh reorganized the police department of his state. The police departments consisted of two separate units ‚Äì rural police and general police. While the rural police consisted of chowkidars (night watchmen) and sepoys, the general police was directly under the control of the respective minister. Previously criminals were imprisoned within the fort. Ram Singh built the Jaipur Central Jail in 1854 where the prisoners were kept. According to Jadunath Sarkar, the greatest contribution of Ram Singh \\"to the cause of economic progress was the construction of metalled and bridged roads, with good staging bungalows at intervals\\". These bungalows were necessary for road travel. He built of the Agra‚ÄìAjmer road. The road connected the western and the eastern parts of his kingdom and his capital Jaipur was located at the road's midway. He also built the long Jaipur‚ÄìTonk road. The Karauli to Mandawar road built by him became an important route of trade. Ram Singh wanted to convert the city of Jaipur into a \\"second Calcutta\\" (present-day Kolkata. At that time, Calcutta was the capital of the British India). He built modern schools, colleges and gas lights in streets of Jaipur. Piped water supply was also introduced. He built the Ram Niwas Garden after being inspired by the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. He built the Jaipur Zoological Gardens as a counterpart of the Alipore Zoological Garden. The Calcutta Medical College found its Jaipuri counterpart in Mayo Hospital. He also constructed the Maharaja School for Girls in 1867 for the cause of women's education. After converting to Shaivism in 1862, the Maharaja humiliated in public and confiscated the properties of Vaishnava in the Jaipur kingdom who did not convert to Shaivism : wear tripundra tilak and rudraksha mala. ref : The Trident in the Palace : An Anti-Vaishnava Cabal in a Hindu Kingdom during the Colonial Period, http://ceias.ehess.fr/docannexe/file/2384/the_trident_extracts_in_english.pdf  Personal life  In 1853, Ram Singh initially chose as his first wife the daughter of the Maharaja of Rewa, in spite of the custom that required him to marry the daughter of the Maharaja of Jodhpur as first wife. Under pressure from the British, he changed his mind while on the way to Rewa, and first married the daughter of the Maharaja of Jodhpur, taking the Rewa woman as his second wife. Ram Singh married 12 times in total. Ram Singh had no issue. He appointed Madho Singh II, the second son of the thakur of Isardha as his heir. On 17 September 1880, Ram Singh died. Madho Singh II also had no issue and appointed Man Singh II as his heir. Photography Ram Singh by Bourne & Shepherd, c. 1872 Ram Singh was passionate about art and photography; he captured (and developed) numerous photographs of women, junior functionaries (like tailors) and nobles of his court. It is believed that Ram Singh was introduced to a camera in 1864 when photographer T. Murray visited Jaipur. After learning how to photograph, he used to carry his camera on all his trips. When western visitors came to his court, he used to learn photography from them. Many of the photographs taken by him were of elite women who so-far lived an entirely secluded private life in the zenanas of his palace; captured in an western artificial setting, consisting of elegant backdrops, Victorian furniture and Persian carpets. It has been since considered as a pioneer effort at portraying Rajput women behind the purdah. Aprior to Ram SIngh's photographs, portraits of specific Rajput women were nearly unknown and artists mass-produced idealized representations of women based on a single model, to serve a variety of occasions, for centuries. Interestingly, the names of the photographed women were not mentioned and whether the Maharanis allowed themselves to be photographed is unknown. Laura Weinstein, an acclaimed art curator argues that the photographs served as an important tool to engage in the widespread discourse about Indian women behind the purdah and they stood out as a rare group of photographs that did not mirror oriental conceptions of Indian domestic life. By appropriating the very European model of portrait photography ‚Äì which emphasized the dignity and propriety of women, he infused dignity into the life of his photograph-figures unlike other concurrent attempts and refuted the colonial notion of the zenana-inhabitants being idle, unhygienic, superstitious, sexually deviant and oppressed. Rather than reforming the purdah system or associated woman issues, his photographs were modern tools that staunchly defended the tradition, much more than it breached, by portraying an apparent normalcy. Ram Singh had also commissioned numerous self-portraits in a variety of poses ranging from a Hindu holy man to a Rajput warrior to a Western gentleman. Vikramaditya Prakash, an art- historian had described them as \\"self-consciously hybridized representations [which] straddle and contest the separating boundary ‚Äì between colonizer and colonized, English and native ‚Äì the preservation and reaffirmation of which was crucial for colonial discourse\\". The glass negatives that produced the portraits, the albumen print photograph collection and his own self-portraits are now displayed at the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum in Jaipur. He was also a life-time member of Bengal Photographic Society.

The battle was part of the so-called Ivangorod Operation, during which the Austro-Hungarians tried to capture the Dƒôblin Fortress (known at that time as Ivangorod), and cross the Vistula. Battle The battle began in the night of October 22/23, 1914, when 3rd Company of 3rd Battalion of Captain Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy was sent on a reconnaissance mission near the fortress. At the same time, Austrian headquarters ordered 1st Legions Regiment to seize the crossings over the Zagozdzonka river and capture hills located on its eastern bank. The Regiment was tasked with holding these positions until the arrival of Austrian 46th Division, and its two battalions: 5th and 6th were sent into the battle. In the morning the battalions achieved the objectives, followed by other subunits of the Regiment. In the afternoon, a battle with three Russian regiments took place near Anielin. On October 23, 1st Battalion of Captain Michal Zymierski captured Russian trenches near the village of Laski. Polish forces suffered heavy losses, with a number of officers killed. In the night of October 23/24, additional Polish battalions entered the battle, but the Russians had initiated their own attack, and Austrian soldiers retreated.

Biography  Born in a former stable of a Blairgowrie hotel to Belle, a member of a group of Travellers, and Alex, a bagpiper, Stewart was chosen as a child by her uncle to carry on her family's stories and songs. Performing at family c√®ilidhs for ten-shilling notes became more public performances in village halls, although the family collectively thought performing was \\"[producing] a natural function\\". In 1954, journalist Maurice Fleming and, later, folklorist Hamish Henderson arrived in town, looking for singers of traditional songs. Over the next twenty years, the Stewarts of Blair became a folk attraction on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1976, Stewart and her family were asked by United States President Gerald Ford to sing in the White House for the bicentennial celebrations. On 1 June 1982, she was chosen to represent the travelling people during Pope John Paul II's visit to Scotland. She sang Ewan MacColl's \\"Moving On Song\\". In addition to writing her mother's biography, Queen Amang the Heather ‚Äì The Life of Belle Stewart, in 2006, she published a series of booklets, titled An Ancient Old Culture, which led to her autobiography, A Traveller's Life, in 2011. Until her death, Stewart shared her family's songs and stories with audiences at home and abroad. She lectured on travellers' culture at Princeton and Harvard universities and sat on the Secretary of State for Scotland's advisory committee on travellers. Stewart died on 9 December 2014, in Dundee, at the age of 77. She was preceded in death by her husband of 51 years, Ian McGregor, who died in 2007. They had four children. Awards and honours In the 2006 Birthday Honours Stewart was made an MBE for her services to Scottish traditional music. In 2016 Stewart was featured in the documentary 'Where You're Meant To Be' along with Aidan Moffat. The film features Moffat travelling around Scotland to perform his reinterpretations of traditional Scottish folk songs. Stewart is critical of Moffat's versions of the songs, though ultimately appears on stage with Moffat at a performance at Glasgow Barrowlands.

He was the adopted son of Ram Singh II, Raja of Jaipur. Biography He was born Kaim Singh, the second son of the Thakur of Isardha, a petty chieftain related to the ruling house of Jaipur. After the death of their father, a dispute with his elder brother over the succession left the teenaged Kaim exiled and living in poverty. He found work as a risaldar in the cavalry of the Nawab of Tonk. His fate was altered by his encounters with the guru Brahmachari Giridhari Sharan, whose disciple he became, and with the ruling Ram Singh II. When Ram died in 1880, he had no heir, and chose on his deathbed to adopt the 18-year-old Kaim, who was crowned under the name Madho. Married a Jadaun lady, daughter of Rao Budhpal Singh of Ummargarh estate, Etah, U.P. As ruler of the large and prosperous state of Jaipur, Madho Singh embraced modern ideas on education and sanitation. He built schools, colleges, hospitals and a museum. When famine struck in 1896‚Äì1897 and 1899‚Äì1900, he used state funds to feed the population. He also appealed to the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, to start a permanent Famine Relief Fund, which Singh began with a gift of ¬£133,000 (). Singh was exceptionally loyal to the British crown, and sent his troops and horses to assist the British side in fighting in Chitral in 1894‚Äì1895, the Tirah Campaign in 1897‚Äì1898 and in the South African War. In the First World War, he again sent his men and machine guns to assist in the Mesopotamian campaign at his own expense. Singh was made an honorary Major-General, and was further rewarded with honours. He was made Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India and of the Order of the Indian Empire, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and of the Order of the British Empire.

It was designed by Simkin & Ibler and built from 1892 to 1929. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2004.  History  Sketch of the proposed church, which was never completed, 1893 St Mary's Catholic Church, South Brisbane, is a late 19th-century rendered brick church designed by Brisbane architects, Simkin and Ibler and constructed by Woollam and Norman in 1892-1893. At the time of its opening on 2 July 1893, construction of the church was not finalised. The proposed tower, transepts and chancel were never built and it was not until 1929 a permanent sanctuary was added to the eastern end of the church to the design of architects Cavanagh and Cavanagh. The former presbytery (now parish house), built at about the same time as the church, was completed by February 1893. St Mary's was the second Catholic church to be built in South Brisbane and was built adjacent to the first church, a small wooden chapel erected in 1865. The chapel was expanded in 1868 when two aisles were added almost doubling its size. Sparsely inhabited in 1861, the population was only 1,080, South Brisbane was a small but growing residential suburb. By 1871 the number of inhabitants had increased to 4,222. In the 1880s, Brisbane experienced an economic and building boom and South Brisbane's population trebled, reaching 22,849 in 1891. The connection of the rail network and the development of commercial, industrial and dockside activities on the southern banks of the river further contributed to South Brisbane's growth. The Municipality of South Brisbane was declared in 1888. As residential suburbs expanded the population of the old municipality of Brisbane decreased, by more than 2,000 between 1886 and 1891. The expansion of the population meant that the chapel was no longer adequate to the needs of the South Brisbane congregation and a meeting was held in August 1889 to discuss the construction of a new and larger church. The Catholic Church had begun acquiring allotments adjoining the original church reserve in 1884 and by 1889 it had amassed considerable land at the northwest end of the block bounded by Cordelia, Peel and Merivale streets. Fund raising for the construction of a new church commenced in 1890 and by the end of 1891 half the cost of the building had been collected. Architects Simkin and Ibler produced drawings of the proposed church. An imposing edifice with Italianate and Romanesque revival details, it was designed to accommodate a congregation of 800 people. George Simkin and John Ibler were architects practising in Brisbane in the 1880s who joined in partnership from 1889 to 1894. One of their early projects, the Breakfast Creek Hotel, is a well-known Brisbane landmark. Much of their work together was for the Roman Catholic Church and included important commissions such as Dara, Archbishop Dunne's residence at Petrie Bight, St Stephen's Roman Catholic Girls School in Charlotte Street and a convent for the Sisters of Mercy in Warwick, Our Lady of Assumption Convent, now a private building called the Cloisters. Simkin and Ibler worked in a variety of architectural styles and their designs are noted for an eclectic, sometimes flamboyant, use of ornament. At St Mary's, described at the time of opening as having the Basilica form of plan and an architectural style derived from \\"a phase of early Italian\\", ornamental details drawn from a variety of sources are elegantly combined to enliven a traditional plan and arrangement. The style of the church, which combines Romanesque and Renaissance revival elements, was not common at the time as most 19th-century churches were designed in the Gothic revival style. Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran laid the foundation stone of the new church on 25 September 1892 at a ceremony attended by Archbishop Robert Dunne (Brisbane), Archbishop Thomas Carr (Melbourne) and other high- ranking clergy. Blessed and opened by Archbishop Dunne on 2 July 1893, St Mary's cost ¬£2,150 to build. Despite the economic crisis and devastating floods of the early 1890s, ¬£1,473 had already been raised for the project and a further ¬£400 was collected at the opening. Due to the limited funds only part of the proposed church was built, the nave and aisles. The concrete rendering was postponed and several parts of the building including the eastern end and the rose window were temporarily constructed from timber. A description of the church as it appeared at its opening, noted the ample provision made for ventilation and the high altar installed in the new church that had previously been used at St Stephen's Cathedral. The presence of St Mary's in South Brisbane in the 1890s reflects to some extent the character of South Brisbane at the time. The Roman Catholic Church drew much of its membership from the Irish and the proletariat, and it was linked to the labour movement. Though South Brisbane attracted some of Brisbane's elite because of its proximity to the city and elevated home sites, South Brisbane in the 1890s had a reputation as a \\"workingman's suburb\\". Most of the names on St Mary's baptism register at the turn of the century were Irish. From 1866 the original chapel had been a dual-purpose building also functioning as a school. After the opening of the new church it continued to be used as a school until 1909 when substantial new school buildings were built on the southwest portion of the site. The chapel then served as the infant's school until 1926 when extensions to the school incorporated rooms for infants. A substantial bell housed in a timber belfry was erected in 1914 adjacent to the church and in 1915 a convent for the Sisters of Mercy was constructed, diagonally opposite the school on the corner of Cordelia and Peel streets. The most significant change to the church since its construction in 1893 was the completion of the sanctuary, including vestry and sacristy, in December 1929. Designed by Cavanagh and Cavanagh Architects in a similar manner to the original building, the sanctuary was constructed of reinforced concrete and brick by B. Robinson. The third Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig, officially opened the additions. The interior of the chancel with its marble wall linings and altar rails, terrazzo floors, domed plaster ceiling and stained glass windows was more ornate than the rest of the church. A new marble altar by sculptor and monumental mason, Frank Williams of Ipswich, who carried out all the marble work, was installed. The original chapel, no longer required for school purposes, was demolished at this time. In 1938, the presbytery was completely renovated. F. Chamberlain of Toowoomba was appointed as architect. The renovations were blessed by the Rev. J. English. The appearance of the building must have been altered quite dramatically. The archbishop expressed amazement at the alteration and the current building bears little resemblance to the original. The original gabled roof appears to have been altered to a hipped roof. With the influx of Catholic immigrants into the area after World War Two, St Mary's became an important gathering place for a number of ethnic groups. Prior to the war the Lebanese community had used the church for Mass, which was said by their own priest, until their church in Ernest Street was constructed. A variety of Catholic communities, which lived initially in South Brisbane after emigrating, were invited to use the church. Italian, Dutch, Polish, Lithuanian and Slovenian people attended St Mary's for services conducted by their own priests. The Dutch Men's Choir performed at the church during the 1950s and 1960s. As late as 1993, the Lithuanian and Slovenian communities regularly met at the church. The Lithuanians conducted a regular Sunday Mass. The Slovenians, whose priest lived in Sydney, used the church less frequently. A plaque in Lithuanian is mounted on a wall at St Mary's. The school closed in 1964 and the school, convent and belfry have since been demolished. The St Vincent de Paul centre now occupies the site of the school. Of the original complex of buildings at St Mary's only the church and presbytery, which has been substantially altered, remain. The former presbytery is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. In 2008, the church was the subject of controversy when the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, John Bathersby, removed the church's long-serving priest, Peter Kennedy, following complaints that he was not observing standard Roman Catholic teachings and practices. Many of his parishioners left the church with him to continue holding services as St Mary's Community in Exile at the Trades and Labour Council building on Peel Street ( away).  Description  St Mary's Catholic Church at South Brisbane, 1900 St Mary's Catholic Church is situated on a large corner block at the intersection of Merivale and Peel Streets in a light industrial and commercial area of the inner Brisbane suburb of South Brisbane. An imposing rendered masonry building with corrugated iron roofs the church is located on the highest part of the site near the western corner. The front of the church faces northwest onto Peel Street. Formerly occupied by an earlier church, the northern portion of the site adjacent to the church and closest to the street intersection is now a car park with some landscaping. In the eastern part of the site facing onto Merivale Street is the former presbytery, a timber building on stumps with corrugated iron hip roofs. The former presbytery is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. St Mary's Catholic Church consists of a wide high central space or nave, narrower aisles on each side of the nave, and a semicircular chancel. A proposed bell tower and transepts were never built. The nave, a double height space with a clerestory, projects forward of the single storey side aisles to form the main facade or liturgical west front of the church. Terminating the longitudinal axis of the nave at the liturgical eastern end is the projecting semicircular chancel. Small rooms, the sacristy and vestry, flank the chancel on the north and south. The nave is roofed by a simple timber framed gable roof with gabled ventilators and the aisles by lean-to roofs. The chancel, sacristy and vestry, all additions at the rear of the church, have smaller separate roofs that are largely concealed by parapet walls. The arrangement and form of the church is based on the traditional model of the basilica, originally a type of Roman public building that early Christians adapted for worship. Described at the time of its completion as being built in a style of architecture based on early Italian, the church has a form and architectural features that are associated with the Romanesque revival but includes a variety of details drawn from other styles. The most characteristic feature of Romanesque architecture is the use of the round arch. Other distinguishing motifs that are used at St Mary's include the wheel or rose window, a frieze that contains a blind arcade, string courses and a type of arched corbel motif known as mock machicolation. The liturgical west front of the church, which actually faces northwest, is simple in form but richly embellished with architectural detail. A two storey structure, taller than it is wide, the symmetrical west front is divided into three bays and surmounted by a parapeted gable in the form of a broken bed pediment. The central bay of the facade contains the main entrance to the church, an imposing arched opening with a shafted jamb framing a recessed doorway. Over the timber panelled doors is a semicircular tympanum containing three arched windows and above the tympanum, a blind arcade of colonettes (thin columns). The main feature of the gable is a wheel window centred in the gap created by the broken base of the pediment. Raked corbelling over the wheel window supports the projecting edge of the pediment. A cross is situated at the pinnacle of the pediment and at the other end of the ridge of the nave roof. The bays on either side of the entrance bay consist of pairs of pilasters on a banded base that appear to support the pediment. Between each set of pilasters are two narrow rectangular windows separated by a half or engaged column. A small square window centred in the base of each bay has unusual moulded surrounds including jambs terminated by a stylised volute and a coved cornice with a leaf pattern. Other facade details include rosettes, dogtooth banding, acanthus leaf capitals to pilasters and arabesque ornamentation on the pediment. The northeast and southwest side elevations are similar. The aisles consist of four bays delineated by engaged piers with an ornamental top. Tall narrow windows with round arched tops are arranged in pairs in each bay with the exception of the bay second from the front that contains the side entrance doors. Each side entrance is an arched opening further emphasised by a shallow decorative gable. Masonry stairs lead up to the entrance into the north aisle while the south aisle is level with the ground outside. The main decorative detail on the side elevations is a double-layered arched corbel table running along the top of the aisle walls between the engaged piers. Above the roof of the aisles the clerestory portion of the nave wall is visible. The wall treatment is similar to the aisle walls including engaged piers and the same pairs of arched windows. The walls are blank at the northern corner of the building where the bell tower was originally proposed. Rear of the church, 2020 The chancel, sacristy and vestry, additions to the rear of church were built using similar materials and details to the original part of the building. Three sets of external masonry stairs lead to timber entrance doors that open directly into each of these three spaces, the stairs on the eastern corner being the tallest due to the slope in the land. The curved walls of the chancel are distinguished by a high row of quatrefoil stained glass windows. All of the entries into the church are marked with a cross, situated at the apex of the roof over. The interior of the church, well lit by natural daylight, has rendered white painted walls, dark stained timber ceilings and choir mezzanine and a concrete floor. The main entrance to the church, located under the mezzanine, has a low raked plaster ceiling. A decorative timber canopy and posts further differentiates the entrance. Quarter-turn timber stairs with winders in the northern corner of the west front lead up to the stepped choir platform, a balcony-like space housing the organ and overlooking the nave. A colonnade of four round arches supported by stumpy columns on tall pedestals runs along the north and south edges of the nave separating it from the aisles. Above the colonnade is the clerestory with arched windows that let light directly into the double height space of the nave. The ceiling of the nave is lined on the rake and exposed timber trusses, a variant of a queen post truss with arched braces, span across the nave. The skillion-roofed aisles also have raked clear finished timber boarded ceilings supported by exposed timber trusses. Narrow round arched windows illuminate the aisles and a set of timber doors with fanlight over open to the exterior. Shrines dedicated to Jesus and Mary are located at the southeast ends of the aisles. The sanctuary is located at the eastern end of the nave. A chancel arch flanked by decorative niches separates the chancel from the nave. A change in floor finish and level defined by a marble altar rail also mark the sanctuary as a different kind of space. The chancel, roofed by a dome, is more richly finished than the rest of the church. It has a mosaic tiled and marble floor, quatrefoil stained glass windows over pilasters surmounted by arches in low relief. The lower part of the curved chancel walls are lined in marble panelling. Located in the centre of the space under the dome is the high altar, an elaborate gothic structure in various coloured marbles. Small rooms located on either side of the chancel are the vestry and sacristy. The room on the southern corner retains built in timber wardrobes and cupboards. Externally the church is surrounded by hard paved surfaces except for lawns near the main entrance and gardens on the northeast side of the church. The original front fence and gates have been replaced but masonry piers on either side of the gates remain. A stone grotto is situated to the west of the main entrance. The former presbytery, now known as the Parish House, and various sheds and utility buildings at the rear of the church are not of cultural heritage significance. The St Vincent de Paul Centre, to the southwest of the church on the neighbouring block, is not included in the listing.  Heritage listing  St Mary's Catholic Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Mary's Catholic Church demonstrates the pattern of development in Brisbane that resulted from the economic boom of the 1880s, in particular the development of South Brisbane at a time when rapid expansion of riverside industry and the adjoining residential suburb created the need for more substantial buildings to service an increased population. Surviving evidence of South Brisbane's former character as a predominantly working class suburb, the church reflects the Irish and proletariat origins of the congregation. Built without the proposed belltower and transepts and not completed at its opening, the church also shows the impact of economic hardships experienced in the 1890s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Most 19th century churches were built in the Gothic Revival style. St Mary's is an early example of a church built in a style derived from Italian Romanesque and Renaissance architecture. Modelled on the basilica, St Mary's was designed in an eclectic manner typical of late 19th century architecture but in a style that was then unusual for churches in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. An excellent example of a substantial late 19th century masonry church, St Mary's demonstrates the principal characteristics of second or permanent churches that were built in established parishes to replace earlier temporary and often dual-purpose structures. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. St Mary's is an important landmark in Peel Street. Simple in overall form and finishes, the church is elegantly detailed with a spacious well-lit interior. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site of the first Catholic church built in South Brisbane in 1865 and used continuously for both worship and Catholic social services ever since, the place has a strong association with the Roman Catholic Church of Queensland. In particular St Mary's has a special association with the migrant Catholic communities that developed in South Brisbane after the Second World War.  In popular culture  In 2011, a feature documentary has been made about Kennedy and the exiled community and their conflict with the Catholic Church, entitled The Trouble with St Mary's. In 2016, the play St Mary's in Exile was written by David Burton about the events that led to the removal of Father Peter Kennedy as parish priest. It was performed in August‚ÄìSeptember 2016 as part of the Brisbane Festival at the Queensland Theatre Company's Bille Brown Theatre, approximately from St Mary's.

She was one of the largest ships in her class at the time and served as the mother-ship of the first Estonian herring expeditions in the 1930s. In World War II she served as a Soviet Navy transport vessel and was subsequently sunk in 1941 near Prangli Island during the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn. History Crew of Eestirand, 1930s (Cpt. Boris Nelke center bottom) The ship was built in 1910 by Archibald McMillan & Son Ltd. in Dumbarton, Scotland and launched as Starthardle for the Burrell & Son Steamship Line. in Glasgow In 1916 the Scottish-American shipping magnate Robert Dollar bought her for his Dollar Steamship Lines. Renamed Harold Dollar, she worked between New York City and Asia. In 1932 the Estonian Fishing Co. bought the ship, then called Glenbeath, from the Waverley Shipping Company in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom for ¬£7,500 pounds sterling. She came to the Estonian port of Tallinn on 12 May where she was renamed Eestirand and refitted for the fishing trade. At the time she was the largest ship in the Estonian merchant fleet. The ship made her maiden voyage as Eestirand on 9 June 1932 under captain Jakob Lepni, with a crew of 142 men and women. She served as the mother ship for the first Estonian herring expedition off the coast of Iceland and took in her first herring catch on 7 July. After its return to Tallinn on 15 September with its cargo, the expedition was considered a success, with Estonian fish exports now exceeding imports. Eestirand continued to serve as the flagship for the Estonian fishing industry until she was requisitioned into the Soviet Navy during the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states. Service in World War II In World War II Eestirand was recommissioned into the Baltic Fleet as VT-532 in 1941. Her primary role was transporting troops and war materiel in the heavily-mined Baltic Sea. As German troops advanced on Tallinn in August 1941, the Soviets began preparations for evacuation. Eestirand would be part of a convoy or ships responsible for the evacuation of Soviet military personnel and Estonian conscripts to Kronstadt to help relieve the German siege of Leningrad. On 24 August 1941 Eestirand came under attack from German planes as she neared the Keri Lighthouse on Keri Island. 44 men were killed in the bombardment, and many more drowned after falling overboard. The commander of the evacuation fleet, Vladimir Tributs, ordered Eestirands captain, Boris Nelke, to continue to Kronstadt. Ignoring the order, Nelke instead chose to head to Prangli Island, about to the south, and beach the badly damaged ship off the shore of the island. Once grounded, Nelke and his crew helped the 2,700 surviving Estonian conscripts to disarm the Soviet military personnel aboard the ship and escape onto the island and avoid mobilization to Leningrad. In 1946 the wreck of Eestirand was raised and towed to Kopli Bay for scrapping. Monument After the war a monument was erected on Prangli Island to honor the passengers and crew of Eestirand who were killed on that voyage. The monument includes a large -high wooden cross with the inscription \\"Eestirand 24‚Äì08‚Äì41\\", adorned with a life preserver from the ship. The original anchor was salvaged from the wreck and set in concrete at the foot of the cross. 42 smaller white wooden crosses stand for those killed in the attack. A central granite pedestal bears a plaque which reads (translated from Estonian): \\"Here at Prangli Island off the coast of Keri on 24 and 25 August 1941, the steam ship Eestirand was lost to bombing of German aircraft. For dozens of Estonians and Russian Jews it was their last sea voyage.\\" Eestirand memorial site.jpg Eestirand memorial site, 2016.jpg II maailmas√µjas hukkunute √ºhishaud-\\"Eesti rand\\".JPG References Category:1910 ships Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:Fishing vessels Category:Maritime incidents in August 1941 Category:Maritime incidents in the Soviet Union Category:Merchant ships of Estonia Category:Ships sunk by German aircraft Category:Shipwrecks in the Gulf of Finland Category:Steamships of the Soviet Union Category:Steamships of the United Kingdom Category:Steamships of the United States Category:World War II naval ships of Estonia Category:World War II naval ships of the Soviet Union Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea ","title":"Eestirand"},{"id":"44657757","text":"William R.

Thirlwell, 1991 EXIT () was a New York-based large- format alternative comic art and graphics magazine published from 1984 through 1992. It was founded in 1983 by George Petros and Adam Parfrey, with Kim Seltzer joining shortly afterward. Five issues were released; a sixth was partially completed. The magazine's history is divided into two eras: the first, from inception through 1987, was characterized by the collaboration of Petros and Parfrey; and the second, spanning from Parfrey's 1987 departure until the project's end, was characterized by Petros's work with J.G. Thirlwell, Robert N. Taylor, Michael Andros and Salvatore Canzonieri.  Contents  Science, science fiction, fringe politics and alternative history influenced EXIT's graphic style. Some of the magazine's contributors worked in a form they christened Serial Art, which adopts the techniques of timelines, graphs and diagrams to show changes, processes, and the flow of situations. Serial Art also appropriates techniques of comic art and film storyboards. Other contributors worked in a form they christened Propagandart, which adopts principals of advertising and propaganda in order to manipulate emotions and opinions. EXIT also presented alternative comics, photomontage, photography, poetry and incendiary literature. EXIT reflected the confrontational punk rock and hardcore punk attitudes of the 1980s. It drew upon the prevailing nihilism of New York's Lower East Side. It presented art and writing considered controversial from contemporaneous political and sociological perspectives. For example, some of the magazine's content endorsed the eradication of boundaries between Left and Right. Notorious historical figures appeared in iconic form. Some of the magazine's content dealt with psychopathic social phenomena such as serial killers and mass murderers. Disparate genres such as scientific illustration and pornography came together in graphic form. In his introduction to the compilation The EXIT Collection (Tacit Press, 1998), George Petros describes EXIT as ‚Äú‚Ä¶ an outlaw Pop Art magazine in opposition to both the underground and the establishment. It was a forum for extreme ideologies and inclinations manifested as political pornography, psychosexual terrorism, scientific threats and infernal texts. It was graced by contributions from the best artists and writers in America ‚Äî famous, infamous, and unknown ‚Ä¶‚Äù  Staff and contributors  Publisher and editor George Petros was a writer, illustrator and graphic artist.

It was built from 1864 to 1932. It is also known as Brisbane South Intermediate School, South Brisbane Primary School, and currently as Brisbane State High School Block H. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 October 1994.  History  Brisbane State High School's Block H, a two-storeyed brick building which is now part of the Junior School, is one of the oldest state school buildings in Queensland. The core was constructed in 1864 as the South Brisbane Primary School, with key extensions erected in 1877 and 1932. The building is associated with the early establishment of general education in Queensland. It was erected under the new Education Act of 1860, which brought all Queensland schools under a Board of General Education, and provided for a system of government-subsidised primary schools, similar to the system then operating in New South Wales (which in turn had been based on the Irish system of National Schools). Under Queensland's Education Act, communities were required to contribute one-third of the cost of construction of new school buildings. Only six primary school buildings were erected in the period 1861‚Äì63, parents finding the one-third contribution difficult to raise. This led to some relaxation of the regulation, and in 1864, eleven schools, including the South Brisbane Primary School, were constructed. Of the 17 primary school buildings erected between 1861 and 1864, the only ones known to remain are Gayndah State School (1861), South Brisbane (1864) and Warwick East State School (1864), all of which are brick buildings. Moves to establish a school at South Brisbane commenced in 1860, and in November 1861 the Queensland Government granted to the Board of General Education, of land fronting Cordelia and Merivale Streets, for school purposes. Subscriptions took some time to raise, and in April 1863, a primary school was established in temporary, overcrowded accommodation at the Mechanics Institute in Stanley Street. The colonial government had approved the application for a new school in February 1863, and had employed Brisbane architect Charles Porter to prepare plans, but delayed calling tenders until December 1863, waiting for the School Committee to raise the one-third contribution. Porter was the first architect for the Board of General Education, and his work for it included the design of the Normal School at North Brisbane, and schools at Little Ipswich, Ipswich State School, and Gladstone. The plan for the South Brisbane school may have been duplicated from that of the Ipswich School. The contract was let in August 1864 to Brisbane contractor Charles Beauchamp, with a tender of , and the building was completed in time for the commencement of the new school year on 23 January 1865. Although designed by Charles Porter, Brisbane architect Benjamin Backhouse was employed to supervise the construction. The two-storey brick building was rectangular in plan, and designed to accommodate 300 pupils. Each floor comprised one large room, with boys on the ground floor, and girls and infants on the upper floor. The unrendered building had a shingled roof, and projecting porch and balconies on the front facade to Merivale Street. The staircase and hat rooms were at the rear of the building. By the 1870s, South Brisbane was rivalling North Brisbane in importance as a commercial and residential area, and the accompanying population increase put pressure on the accommodation at the South Brisbane Primary School. At least one playshed (no longer extant) had been erected by 1873, and in 1874 a balcony was added to the rear of the school building, for girls and infants. In the second half of 1877, substantial additions were made with the construction of a two-storey brick wing at right-angles to the rear of the building. This provided two new classrooms, each about , with exterior stairs. The contractor was P Nott, with a price of . South Brisbane, with its busy wharves and commercial sector, continued to expand in the boom years of the 1880s, and the district population trebled. During this decade the school playground, much of which comprised low-lying swampy ground, was filled and levelled, partly using rock excavated in 1884 for the second stage of the South Brisbane Dry Dock. Early in 1888 the shingled roof of the school building was replaced with corrugated iron sheeting. By the late 1880s, overcrowding at the South Brisbane Primary School had reached a critical stage. In 1888 the Department of Public Instruction decided to divide the school, which had already been operating as two separate departments. A new building was erected on the other side of Merivale Street, at the corner of Glenelg Street, and this became Brisbane South Boys School. South Brisbane Primary School was closed, then re-opened as Brisbane South Girls & Infants School. Comparatively few changes were made to the Girls & Infants School in the following three decades. About 1914 a small, single-storey, timber retiring room for staff was erected on the northern side of the 1877 wing, and this room was duplicated on the southern side. (These two small buildings have since been re-located about to the south against Cordelia Street.) New windows were installed in the rear wing in 1927. By the late 1920s, South Brisbane's heyday was over. The progressive City of South Brisbane had been absorbed in 1925 by the new City of Brisbane, and South Brisbane had lost much of its civic focus. Many of the larger residences were being converted into flats by the mid-1920s, and young families were moving to the less crowded workers' dwellings suburbs, like Annerley, Greenslopes and Coorparoo. Enrolments at both Brisbane South Girls & Infants School and Brisbane South Boys School were declining. In December 1928, Department of Public Instruction approval was given for alterations costing to the Girls & Infants School, for conversion to an Intermediate School. On 31 December 1928, the two existing South Brisbane state schools were closed, and on 1 January 1929, the former Boys School was re-opened as the combined Brisbane South State School. At the former Girls & Infants School, the exterior walls were rendered, the rooms were partitioned, and the front porch was removed, and the building was re-opened in August 1929 as Brisbane South Intermediate School. In 1930, plans were prepared to extend the 1864 wing of the Brisbane South Intermediate School by an additional four bays to the southeast, virtually doubling its size. The contract for this work was let in 1932, at a cost of . Intermediate schools, equipped with workshops, laboratories, and domestic science rooms, were established in principal Queensland towns after 1928. They reflected a fundamental change in Queensland education policy in the late 1920s, focussing on syllabus revision and the education of children over 11 years of age. In Brisbane, Intermediate schools were established as separate institutions, but in country areas, they formed part of existing high schools. They catered for children 12‚Äì13 years of age, offering a two-year course as a link between primary and secondary education. Setting up new schools for a two-year course proved expensive, and the Intermediate school concept was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by multilateral high schools offering a variety of courses. Brisbane South Intermediate School was closed on 31 December 1953. In the late 1940s, the deteriorating condition of the Brisbane South State Primary School building (erected 1888), had prompted proposals either to close the school, or to transfer to another site. The decision was postponed for some years, but by March 1954, the cost of repairs to the 1888 building was considered too great, and recommendation was made to transfer the school to the premises formerly occupied by the Brisbane South Intermediate School. In August 1954, Brisbane South State School re-occupied the premises vacated by the Girls & Infants School 25 years before. At this time, nearby Brisbane State High School was using two rooms and the laboratory on the top floor of the building; it was anticipated that the High School would vacate these rooms in 1955, but it is not clear whether this eventuated. With student numbers continuing to decline, Brisbane South Primary School was closed permanently on 31 December 1963, after more than one hundred years of operation. The school premises, also close to a century old, subsequently became part of the High School, and were used mainly for domestic science and manual training classes. The building was refurbished in 1989 as Brisbane State High School's Junior School, and further work was carried out in 1991. The former primary school building and the teachers' retiring rooms continue as part of the high school campus in 2014.  Description  Brisbane State High School, Block H is a two-storey rendered brick building with steeply pitched corrugated iron gable roofs. It stands within a complex of school buildings which includes two small timber pavilions, the former teachers' retiring rooms, which were once attached to verandahs of an 1877 wing former primary school building. Constructed in three primary stages, the former primary school building comprises a main north-east facing wing (constructed in 1864 and 1932), with a smaller wing projecting to the south-west (1877). In the main building, a stairwell and main entrance divides the 1864 section to the north-west from the 1932 section to the south- east. The 1877 section projects out from the centre of the 1864 section. The building has full-length timber verandahs to each long side. The principal frontage to the north-east is decorated with toothed windows surrounds and quoins, and has large carved brackets supporting the verandah. The ground floor entry is marked with battened panels over a porch. The verandah has a timber balustrade and square timber posts with square capitals supporting a skillion roof. The skillion is timber-lined and the verandah soffit has a timber battened ceiling. The south-western frontage of the main building is clad in weatherboard with internally exposed framing and small openings. The building has large casement windows and timber French doors with fanlights with timber mullions opening onto the verandahs. The 1877 wing has similarly detailed verandahs, windows and doors to the main building, but opening surrounds are not decorated. The upper floor has a row of large casement windows facing south-east, and smaller windows to the north west. The gable end of the 1864 section has windows with toothed surrounds, whilst the 1932 and 1877 sections have gable ends without openings or decoration. The main building contains five classrooms on each level, three belong to the 1864 section, and two to the 1932 section. The building has two sets of concrete stairs with timber balustrades; the main entrance stair and another in the north-western corner of the building. The ground floor classrooms in the main wing have timber lined ceilings, and are separated by timber folding partitions. The upper floor classrooms have timber floors, timber-lined ceilings with raked sides, and partially exposed trusses. The south-western verandah has a timber-lined ceiling with exposed rafters, which butts against fixed-on-the-diagonal, timber-lined gable end where the rear wing intersects the main wing. The 1877 building has a single large classroom on each level. The ground floor room has a timber-lined ceiling, whilst the first floor room has timber floors, exposed timber trusses and a diagonally boarded ceiling. The teachers' retiring rooms, now detached from the former primary school buildings, are located about to its south against Cordelia Street. These two buildings are single room, weatherboard buildings with corrugated iron half- gabled roofs, sitting on painted concrete stumps with timber battening. The half-gables have shaped barge boards and battened panels with louvred vents behind. The rooms have central solid timber doors reached by timber stairs, and single casement windows on two faces, with sunhoods which extend out from the roof and have lattice side panels and timber brackets. The buildings are virtually identical, with the exception of a high window on the southern building. Internally they are lined with vertically jointed timber, and have timber boarded ceilings with partly raked edges.  Heritage listing  The former Brisbane South Girls and Infants School, now Block H of Brisbane State High School, was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 October 1994 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building is one of the oldest state school buildings in Queensland, and was associated with the early development of a system of general education in Queensland following separation from New South Wales in 1859. It illustrates the development of South Brisbane, as reflected in the 1877 additions and in the 1888 separation of the boys and girls schools. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is a rare example of a two-storeyed 1860s brick school building with several extensions, and has remained coherent in form and detail. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is a rare example of a two-storeyed 1860s brick school building with several extensions, and has remained coherent in form and detail. The alterations and extensions carried out in 1929-32 are important evidence of the implementation of the Intermediate School system, experimented with by the Queensland Department of Public Instruction during the interwar years. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The 1910s teachers' retiring rooms are skilfully detailed modest pavilions.

Early life and career Bailey was born in Melbourne, Derbyshire, the son of William Heap Bailey and his wife Elizabeth n√©e Worall. Bailey attended the Derby Mechanics Institution and joined the Civil Service in 1864 as an assistant bookkeeper in the Science & Arts Department. In 1866, he moved to the Civil Service Commission and then in 1869 to the Paymaster General's office. Football career Bailey played football for the Civil Service and for Upton Park (from 1868 to 1870), becoming the club captain. In November 1870, C. W. Alcock and Arthur F. Kinnaird were organising the second \\"international\\" match between an England XI and a Scotland XI. Kinnaird had initially selected William Baillie-Hamilton (who also played for the Civil Service) as one of the \\"Scottish\\" players, but he failed to arrive in time for the match, to be played at Kennington Oval on 19 November 1870. Despite having little or no Scottish connections, William Bailey was selected to make up the numbers. The Bailey family tradition is that an ancestor had come to England with Bonnie Prince Charlie's army in 1745 and had settled in Derby. In the match report in the Sporting Gazette, Bailey's name is mis-spelt as \\"Baillie\\". The match ended in a 1‚Äì0 victory to the English, with the solitary goal coming from R.S.F. Walker. Later career In about 1870, Bailey joined the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent, and later returned to London as their local manager. There are two mentions of William Heap Bailey in The London Gazette: *On 16 April 1880, he is mentioned as executor of Thomas Henry Dagg. Bailey is described as a \\"Brewer\\" of Burton- on-Trent. *On 24 July 1900, he is listed as a shareholder in a petition to wind up Doherty Iron Castings Process Limited. He is described as a \\"gentleman\\". Other petitioners include Dugald Drummond, the locomotive engineer. In 1881, he married Louisa Cartlidge; they had one son and two daughters.

The acropolis hill is about 90 metres above the plain of Katara, and the plain is above the level of the sea. The ruins occupy a considerable space on both sides of the stream. There are two theatres at Balbura; one is on the south side of the acropolis hill, and the other is in a hollow in the front of the mountain on the south side of the stream: the hollow in the mountain formed the cavea. There are also remains of several temples at Katara; and of Christian churches. The ethnic name ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ≤ŒøœÖœÅŒµœçœÇ occurs on two inscriptions at least at Katara. The site was discovered by Hoskyn and Forbes. Balbura was part of a district called Cabalia, named Cabalis by Strabo with two other cities, Bubon and Oenoanda. Balbura minted coins during the Hellenistic Age and during the reign of Caligula.  Bishopric  Balbura was a bishopric early, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Myra, the capital of the Roman province of Lycia. The names of four of its bishops are recorded in extant documents.

Many nations use foreign vaults for safe-keeping of part of their gold reserves. In 2014, there was movement by some European nations to return gold stored abroad back to the owner country. The Dutch De Nederlandsche Bank reduced its proportion of gold held by the New York Federal Reserve from 51% to 31%, and Austria and Belgium reviewed the possibility of taking similar measures. World Gold Reserves from 1845 to 2013, in tonnes. Changes in central bank gold reserves by country 1993-2014. Switzerland sold three times more gold than any other country.  Venezuela  Before 2012, the Central Bank of Venezuela, Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV), held about 211 tons of its 365 tons of gold reserves in American, European, and Canadian banks. In January 2012, however, Venezuela completed the move of 160 tons of gold bars (valued at about $9 billion) back home. The operation was ordered by President Hugo Ch√°vez in August 2011 and was overseen by Central Bank chair Nelson Merentes. In early November 2018, the Bank of England in London refused the withdrawal of 14 tons of gold owned by the BCV at the request of top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, who lobbied their U.K. counterparts to help cut off the regime from its overseas assets.  Netherlands  In 2014, 122.5 tons of Dutch gold reserves were returned to Amsterdam from New York, where they had been stored in a vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; the De Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, said that it \\"felt that in times of financial crisis, it was better to have the gold near at hand.\\" The Netherlands continues to store gold reserves in New York, Ottawa and London.  Germany  In January 2013, Deutsche Bundesbank, the German central bank, announced plans to repatriate 300 tons of its 1,500 tonne reserve from the U.S., and 374 tons from France by 2020, in order to store (1,695.3 tons) of its official gold reserves in Frankfurt. The gold stored in the U.S. was acquired by West Germany during a period trade surpluses with the U.S. before the 1970. The gold was never repatriated to Germany due to fear of invasion by the Soviet Union. In 2013, five tons were repatriated due to logistical difficulties. However, 120 tons in 2014 (35 tons from Paris, 85 tons from New York); a further 210 tons in 2015 (110.5 tons from Paris and 99.5 tons from New York); and finally 200 tons in 2016, were repatriated.  Belgium  In an interview with Belgium broadcaster VTM Nieuws, Luc Coene, governor of Belgium‚Äôs central bank, confirmed that the bank is looking at how they can bring their gold reserves back into the country. According to IMF data compiled by the World Gold Council, Belgium holds 227.4 metric tons of gold, representing 34.2% of its official foreign reserves. According to reports, most of the gold is held outside of the country with the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Bank for International Settlements.  Switzerland  Save our Swiss Gold motion was a citizen movement that called for the central bank to hold at least 20 percent of its assets in gold, prohibit selling any gold in future and bring all its reserve of gold back in the country. This referendum was held on November 30, 2014, but was lost.  Austria  Austria currently holds 80% of their 280 tons of gold in London, 17% in Austria, and 3% in Switzerland. Citing a need for risk diversification, Austria announced they will be repatriating gold from London during 2015. After the repatriation process has completed, 50% of Austria's gold will be held in Austria, 20% in Switzerland, and the remaining 30% in London.  India  India's central bank bought 200 metric tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund in 2009, in the first major move by a major central bank to diversify its foreign-exchange reserves.  Mexico  In 2011, Mexico quietly purchased nearly 100 tons of gold bullion, as central banks embarked on their biggest bullion buying spree in 40 years. China, Russia, and India had acquired large amounts of gold in recent years, while Thailand, Sri Lanka and Bolivia had made smaller purchases.  Bangladesh  On September 9, 2010, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced the sale of 10 metric tons of gold to the Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of Bangladesh.

It is administered by a trustee and the HR & CE departments of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temple has a fairly large Ghoshala (Cow Care Center) housing more than 15 cows and calves. Daily poojas are conducted according to the Vaighanasa Agama as laid out by Sree Viganasha Acharya. Mythology According to the mythology associated with the temple, Lord Vishnu accompanied by his consorts Sree Bhoodevi and Sree Shridevi visited this town to attend the purported marriage of Sree Kamakshi with Lord Shiva in his capacity as brother of Sree Kamakshi. He had to return as the scheduled marriage could not be solemnized in Mangadu. It is said that it is mandatory for Pilgrims visiting to Mangadu Kamakshi Amman Temple must also visit this Temple along with the Valleeswarar Temple and offer their prayers. The Temple The Temple has a five Tier Vimana facing the Main road in the east direction. There is a Shrine for Thirukachi Nambi - Saint Philosopher and Guide to Sree Ramanujacharya in a seated posture. An idol of Sree Ramanujacharya has also been installed. Lord Vishnu is seen sporting a Ring that he had to present to Shri Kamakshi in his right palm. He is in a seated posture flanked by his consorts. Sage Markandeya Maharishi is seen in a seated posture meditating before the Lord. The Lord holds Chakra (Discuss) Shanku (Conch) in his upper arms. The Discuss and the Conch are carved out in a similar design to the Discuss and Conch in the Valleeswarar Temple, suggesting both the temples have origins around the same time. The Temple also houses separate shrines for Goddess Kanakavalli Thayar (Lakshmi) and Sree Andal. There are also separate shrines for Sree Chakarathalwar (Sudarshana) and Anjaneya.http://www.greenmesg.org/temples_chennai/m/mangadu_vaikuntha_perumal_temple.php  References Category:Vishnu temples Category:Hindu temples in Kanchipuram district ","title":"Vaikunta Perumal Mangadu"},{"id":"44659369","text":"Anil Kumar Mann (born 11 December 1980) is an Indian wrestler who was a silver medallist at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in the men's freestyle 96 kg event.

Career Hikmet Ersek is Chief Executive Officer and Director of The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU). During Ersek's tenure as CEO, which began in 2010, Western Union has diversified its business model into a digital global payments company, growing its retail money-transfer business to more than 550,000 worldwide locations, over 100,000 ATMs and kiosks, and connecting billions of bank accounts and mobile wallets worldwide. During this time, the company's market capitalization has decreased by over 25% while the NASDAQ Composite has increased by nearly 200%. Also during his direction, The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) stock price has decreased by over 5% while the Vanguard Financials Index has increased by over 120%. Ersek has maintained a base salary of $1 million for the last three years ending 2017, but his full pay for 2017 was $9,726,400. This is a 13% increase in pay from fiscal year 2016. In 2018, Ersek experienced a 6% decrease in full pay to $9,175,300. In 2018, Ersek spent $128,570 on personal travel expenses using the company's private jet. Ersek began his career in financial services in 1986 at Europay / MasterCard in Austria. In 1996, he joined GE Capital, and also represented the GE Corporation as a National Executive in Austria and Slovenia before he joined The Western Union Company.  Controversies  The Western Union Company has been fined hundreds of millions of dollars under Ersek's leadership. In 2017, Western Union admitted to anti-money laundering and consumer fraud violations and agreed to pay $586 million in a settlement with the Department of Justice. Among other charges, the Justice Department showed that Western Union was complicit in creating an ecosystem where criminals were able to engage in consumer fraud and human trafficking. In 2018, Western Union was fined $60 million by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The press release accompanying the fine stated that, \\"Western Union executives put profits ahead of the company‚Äôs responsibilities to detect and prevent money laundering and fraud, by choosing to maintain relationships with and failing to discipline obviously suspect, but highly profitable, agents.\\" On May 29, 2019, Western Union announced the departure of a company executive, Odilon Almeida, who served as executive vice president and president of Global Money Transfer. In 2012, Stewart Stockdale, who had the same position as Almeida, left the company in a similar situation. This marked the second time, in less than a decade that an executive at Western Union left with Ersek alone at the helm. Personal life Eresk was born in Istanbul, Turkey to a mother from Austria and a father from Turkey. His parents met in Paris and then settled in Istanbul. Ersek attended TED Ankara College in Ankara until, at 19, he moved to Austria to attend the Vienna University of Economics and Business. where he graduated with a Master's (Magister) degree in Economics and Business Administration. He speaks English, German and Turkish fluently. He also had a short career as a professional basketball player. Ersek currently lives in the Denver Metro Area, where Western Union is based.

The movie had its world premiere on 7 October 2014 at the Sitges Film Festival and stars Luz Cipriota as a journalist whose devotion to her craft has placed her life in danger. In 2013 an unfinished version of the film was one of two films that were given a Bloody Work in Progress Award by the Ventana Sur film festival, which secured distribution rights for DVD, VOD and pay tv for Mexican territory. Synopsis Jazm√≠n (Luz Cipriota) is an intrepid young reporter that decides to investigate the disappearance of the daughter of a wealthy cattle businessman. She soon finds that this disappearance is more than what it seems, as it is related to multiple murders and the resulting story has the potential to give Jazm√≠n a name in the reporting world. As she delves deeper and deeper into the mystery she also brings herself and her cameraman closer to danger, as someone or someones do not want their activities to be uncovered.

He stated that he then began to view footage of cruelty inflicted on food animals, which he felt was a double standard because while the cruelty existed it did not deter consumer purchasing rates and seemed to Grieco as if the cruelty was deliberately being ignored. Grieco filmed the movie on a limited budget and actress Cipriota stated that this aspect was part of what drew her to the film. Reception Bloody Disgusting gave Still Life 3.5 out of 5 skulls, writing that while most of the film- particularly its opening prologue- was extremely powerful, the film's epilogue was \\"so painfully contrived and farcical that it shirks off the previous 90 minutes and dives headfirst into laughable slasher territory.\\" References External links * Category:2010s serial killer films Category:2010s horror thriller films Category:2014 directorial debut films Category:2014 horror films Category:Argentine horror thriller films Category:Argentine films Category:Torture in films ","title":"Still Life (2014 film)"},{"id":"44659495","text":"Udrea is a Romanian name and surname that may refer to: * Udrea BƒÉleanu (died ca. 1601), Wallachian statesman and military leader * Elena Udrea (born 1973), Romanian politician * Maria Udrea (born 1990), Romanian √©p√©e fencer  See also  * Udre»ôti (disambiguation) Category:Romanian-language surnames ","title":"Udrea"},{"id":"44659496","text":"Douglas is a former township in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

The village was settled by the troops of the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants) for their service in the war, protecting Nova Scotia from ongoing American Patriot attacks by land and sea. In 1861, Douglas Township became part of the newly formed Municipal District of East Hants, along with neighbouring townships. References * John Duncanson.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1891. It is also known as Montague Hotel. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 April 1993.  History  The Coronation Hotel was built in 1891 to a design by prominent Brisbane architect Francis Drummond Greville Stanley. It was originally called the Montague Hotel. At the time of its construction the hotel stood near the heart of the prospering South Brisbane commercial and residential areas. Its first proprietor was George Lotz. In 1953 it was renamed the Coronation Hotel after the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. From the early 1970s the licensee was rugby league personality Ripper Doyle. In 1987 the hotel was acquired for redevelopment by neighbouring Queensland United Foods Industries. The redevelopment did not eventuate and it operated as a backpackers hostel during Expo 88 and for some time afterwards. It was unoccupied at the time of its heritage listing in 1993, and housed music venue The Joynt for five years until June 2014. In October 2014, it was reopened as a cocktail bar, The Milk Factory.  Description  The hotel occupies a corner site on Montague Road. It is a two-storeyed rendered and painted brickwork building with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The street facades are surrounded by a cantilevered iron-lace verandah and an awning over the street, with an entrance at the truncated corner. The ground floor street facades have paired half-fluted pilasters with square motifs above the capitals, and relief moulds which express a base to the building. Timber French doors alternate with timber sash windows which have narrow side lights. The corrugated iron awning extends beyond the edge of the cantilevered balcony above, and is supported by timber posts; two of the original cast iron Corinthian columns remain on the Montague Road frontage. The first floor has timber French doors and sash windows. The balcony has a cast-iron balustrade, and galvanised sheet iron columns with cast zinc bases and capitals, and a convex corrugated iron awning. The parapet above the awning has a cornice with dentil blocks, a pediment over the corner, and three shaped gables embellished with spheres. A substantial two-storeyed brick service wing with an intact timber verandah extends off the rear. A gable-roofed laundry stands in the back yard. Next to the service wing is a more recent two-storeyed brick toilet block. The ground floor interior includes two renovated bars, a dining room which is now partitioned, the kitchen, the store and bathrooms. On the first floor, accessed by a fine timber staircase, are a number of bedrooms and bathrooms. With the exception of the bars and bathrooms, the interior is largely intact. The walls are lined with plaster, and fretwork fanlights remain above the doors. In the bedrooms, the tongue and groove timber ceilings have metal rose vents. Although the building requires repairs, it is substantially intact, in particularly the exterior, which is a fine example of the architect's skill.  Heritage listing  Coronation Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 April 1993 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Coronation Hotel is significant as it has a special association with architect FDG Stanley as an example of his work. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Coronation Hotel is significant as an intact remnant of an early streetscape of a residential scale which is now rare and endangered. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The hotel demonstrates the principal characteristics of an 1890s hotel. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Coronation Hotel is important in exhibiting aesthetic characteristics valued by the community in its fine design.

Design In 1961 Jacques and Jules Godbille built a three- seat light aircraft based on the structure of the Piper PA-20 Pacer. Powered by a Lycoming O-235-C air-cooled flat four engine rather than the Pacer's more usual Lycoming O-290-D, the closest Piper variant was the PA-20S 115. The engine cowlings of the Piper and Gobille are distinct, the latter having a wide open nose and a gap at its rear rather than merging smoothly into the fuselage. The Godbille's wing tips are square and fitted with tip plates, whereas the Piper's are rounded, and the Godbille's vertical tail is taller than the Piper's and straight edged rather than curved. Operational history The sole Godbille GJJ was registered on 7 December 1961 and flew for the first time before the end of the year. The Godbilles retained it for a decade but after that it changed hands rapidly, with eight different owners before 1988. It remains on the French Civil Aircraft Register in 2014.

Bundesliga. The highest league these teams can currently enter is the 3. Liga, set at the third tier of the league system. Until 2005, reserve teams of professional sides carried the title Amateure behind the club name to distinguish between the professional and reserve team of a club while all other reserve teams carried the Roman numeral II behind the club name as a distinction. Since 2005 all reserve teams carry the Roman numeral, regardless of the status of the first team. Any additional reserve teams carry the following Roman numeral behind the club's name. From 1974 to 2008 reserve teams were permitted to compete in the DFB-Pokal, the premier German Cup competition. Arguably the greatest success of any reserve team has been the achievement of Hertha BSC Amateure which reached the German Cup final in 1992‚Äì93. Additional achievements have been the eleven titles won by reserve teams in the now defunct German amateur football championship. In the former East Germany, reserve teams were at times permitted to play at the second tier of league football, below the DDR-Oberliga, in the DDR-Liga, and have achieved division titles at this level. Rules and regulations Reserve teams in Germany are permitted to play at all league levels except the top two divisions. Another restriction applies to the Regionalligas, where the number of reserve teams is restricted to seven per regional division. Reserve teams of 3. Liga clubs are also not permitted to play at Regionalliga level. Until 2014 reserve teams in the form of under 23 sides were compulsory for Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga clubs, this rule was however dropped at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. Reserve teams at this level are generally run as under 23 side and have U 23 attached to their name as special exceptions apply to the use of under 23 players in both the first and second teams. While senior players can not be freely moved between the individual teams of clubs and require a four-game stand down period between team moves this rule is relaxed for under 23 players. Reserve teams are not permitted to take part in the DFB- Pokal anymore. Should a reserve team qualify for it through its league placing or a regional Verbandspokal the spot will be awarded to the next-ranked first team. The leagues below the 3. Liga are governed by regional federations and associations and rules and regulations governing reserve teams can vary. In the Bavarian Football Association, the largest regional one in Germany, reserve teams can only play one tier below the league of the senior team from the Regionalliga Bayern, the fourth tier, to the Kreisliga, the eighth tier. Below the Kreisliga reserve teams can play at the same level as the senior team but not in the same league. If this is the case a club has to designate a first and second team before the start of the season.Spielordnung BFV website: Rules & Regulations, accessed: 15 January 2015 History =West Germany= In post-Second World War West Germany and the Saarland, which joined the former in 1957, reserve teams of professional sides playing at Oberliga and 2. Oberliga level, termed Vertragsspielervereine (English: Clubs with contracted players), were granted permission by the DFB in 1951 to field an amateur reserve team within the league system.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fu√üball-Verband, page: 20 Reserve teams started earning promotion to the third tier, the highest level they were permitted to play, in the late 1950s. The third tier of league football in the West was generally quite regionalised with most leagues carrying the title 1. Amateurliga in their name. The exception was Northern Germany and West Berlin, where the Amateurliga was set at the second tier as there were no 2. Oberligas in those two regions.Das Deutsche Fussball Archiv Historic German league tables, accessed: 13 January 2015kicker Almanach, Yearbook of German football An early forerunner of these teams was the 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken II which played in the Ehrenliga Saarland from 1948 to 1951 in place of its senior team which played the 1948‚Äì49 season in Division 2 in the French football league system and in a friendlies competition, the Saarland Cup, until 1951.Saar Final Tables 1948 to 1951 RSSSF.com, accessed: 13 January 2015 From the late 1950s reserve teams started to win league titles in their respective Amateurligas. While they were permitted to play in the German amateur championship they could not achieve promotion to the leagues above. With the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963 the Oberligas and 2. Oberligas were replaced by the Bundesliga and five Regionalligas below. The Amateurligas remained as the third tier and the status of reserve teams remained unchanged. From 1974 onwards amateur teams could qualify for the enlarged DFB-Pokal through the regional cup competitions, the Verbandspokale, which incidentally also opened the competition to reserve teams. Also in 1974 the five Regionalligas were replaced by two regional 2. Bundesligas. In 1978 the Amateurligas were renamed to Amateur-Oberligas and reduced in number to eight leagues. On both occasions the status of the reserve teams remained untouched. =East Germany= The DDR-Liga was established as the second tier of the league system in 1950 and did not initially include any reserve teams. The first reserve side to play in the league was Chemie Halle II which played there for a season in 1958, at a time when East German football followed the Soviet Unions example and played a calendar year season. The team was relegated immediately again despite finishing fourth because the senior team was relegated to the DDR-Liga. Reserve teams returned to the league for the 1967‚Äì68 season, now played in the autumn-spring format again and in two regional divisions, when F.C. Hansa Rostock II, FC Carl Zeiss Jena II and Rot- Wei√ü Erfurt II were promoted to the league. The league was expanded in 1971 to five regional divisions and Dynamo Berlin II became the first reserve team to win a division in 1971‚Äì72, repeating this success the following season with Dynamo Dresden II also taking out a league title. Chemie Halle II and Carl Zeiss Jena II won division titles in 1975‚Äì76 but all eleven reserve teams were removed from the league and relegated at the end of that season. At the end of the 1983‚Äì84 season the DDR-Liga was reduced to two divisions again and reserve teams were re-admitted to the league with five reserve teams earning promotion. Dynamo Berlin II won a third championship in the second division in 1985‚Äì86, the last of any reserve team. The last two reserve teams to compete in the DDR-Liga were Dynamo Dresden II and Dynamo Berlin II, with both leaving the league after the 1988‚Äì89 season. No reserve team ever reached the final of the FDGB-Pokal, the premier East German cup competition.East Germany - List of Cup Finals RSSSF.com, accessed: 17 January 2015 =Germany= In 1991 the German reunion brought an influx of former East German teams and their reserve sides as well as three new Amateur-Oberligas in the East. In 1994 the Regionalligas were reintroduced, now as the new third tier of league football, with five regional divisions. Reserve teams were permitted to enter this league provided they had qualified.Regionalliga tables & results from 1963 to present Fussballdaten.de accessed: 13 January 2015 The number of Regionalliga divisions was reduced to two in 2000. From 2005 onwards reserve teams of professional sides in the two Bundesligas were rebranded to the Roman numeral II behind the club name instead of the designation Amateure. In 2008 another major change was made to the league system when the 3. Liga was established. Reserve teams were granted the right to enter this new third division, also initially a ban on reserve teams in the league was considered,Dritte Liga doch mit zweiten Mannschaften? kicker.de, published: 16 August 2006, accessed: 13 January 2015 but were from then on banned from the DFB-Pokal. The number of Regionalligas was expanded to three again and to five in 2012. Reserve teams of 3. Liga clubs were not permitted to enter Regionalliga level and could only rise as far as the Oberliga below. Additionally, the number of reserve teams per Regionalliga division was capped at seven but with the possibility of exceptions being granted.Struktur der Regionalligen seit der Saison 2012/2013 DFB website: Structure of the Regionalligas since 2012, accessed: 13 January 2015Spielordnung DFB website: Rules & Regulations, accessed: 16 January 2015 In 2014 a change in the regulations by the Deutsche Fu√üball Liga regarding reserve teams meant that such sides, in the form of under 23 teams, were not compulsory anymore for Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga clubs. Following this change some reserve teams were withdrawn from competition, among them Eintracht Frankfurt II, FSV Frankfurt II and Bayer 04 Leverkusen II. Bayer 04 Leverkusen had requested the change as it did not see much potential for reserve team players in the Regionalliga to break through to the Bundesliga side and wanted to focus on its under 17 and under 19 sides instead and to loan out young players.Regionalliga: Bayer Leverkusen meldet U23-Team ab Der Spiegel, published: 23 April 2014, accessed: 13 January 2015 This trend continued at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season when both Dynamo Dresden and Chemnitzer FC withdrew their reserve teams, instead favouring a competition of friendly matches that could include other reserve teams from the region as well as the Czech Republic.R√ºckzugswelle der U23 Teams? fupa.net, published: 30 March 2015, accessed: 14 May 2015 Apart from these two teams, 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken II, 1. FC Union Berlin II, VfL Bochum II, SpVgg Unterhaching II and SV Wehen Wiesbaden II were also withdrawn at the end of the season. Support Reserve teams generally average less spectators than first teams in the same league. Since the establishment of the 3. Liga, for example, reserve teams have generally taken up the bottom spots in the spectator tables of the league, the exception being Borussia Dortmund II which fared slightly better. While the 3. Liga, in recent seasons, averaged around 5,000 spectators per home game reserve sides like VfB Stuttgart II and Werder Bremen II have averaged between 1,000 and 1,500 spectators.3\\\\.

It is perpetuated due to the prevalence of perceptions, stereotypes, and images of certain groups. \\"Racism\\" is defined as the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race. Racism functions as a way to distinguish races as inferior or superior to one another. \\"Sexism\\" is defined as prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination on the basis of sex. Gendered racism differs in that it pertains specifically to racial and ethnic understandings of masculinity and femininity, as well as along gendered forms of race and ethnic discrimination. Fundamentally, age, class, and gender are intersecting categories of experience that affect all aspects of human life. Thus, they simultaneously structure the experiences of all people in society. At any moment, race, class, or gender may feel more salient or meaningful in a given person's life, but they are overlapping and cumulative in their effects on people's experiences.Anderson & Collins, 2004 This emphasizes that it is difficult for an individual to differentiate which aspect of their identity is being attacked. It may be impossible for an individual to assess whether discrimination is due to gender or race. Both of these constructs make up the individual's identity, and they intersect with one another. Because people have intersecting social identities, it is important to focus on how these identities shape an individual's experiences. Origin The term gendered racism was originally coined by sociologist Philomena Essed, and refers to the simultaneous experience of both racism and sexism. According to Essed, racism and sexism \\"intertwine and combine under certain conditions into one hybrid phenomenon\\".Essed, 1991 Coping As a means of coping, African American women relied heavily on the support of the black community. They also coped by overachieving or being overly successful, and thinking positively.Thomas, Witherspoon & Speight, 2008. Research demonstrated that the coping mechanisms employed by African American women were not always beneficial because they heightened distress rather than decrease it. Possible ways to cope with gendered racism include education, in which African American women are provided with a space to openly discuss their experiences and develop strategies to better handle situations when they are being discriminated against. Another research experiment was conducted in order to assess how black female college students cope with gendered racial microaggressions. Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.Wing Sue & Rivera, 2010 The results from these focus groups showed that there were five coping strategies employed: two resistance coping strategies, one collective coping strategy, and two self-protective coping strategies. The two resistance coping strategies were using one's voice as power and resisting Eurocentric standards. When Black women use their voice as power they are actively speaking up and addressing the microaggressions in order to assert power in the situation. In order to resist Eurocentric standards black women are compelled to shy away from the traditional standards of beauty as well as dominant ideologies held by the larger society. The collective coping strategy proved to be leaning on one's support networks in which individuals find solace through interactions with friends and family. The women who utilized this coping strategy spoke about the comfort they found in having support from other women who had similar experiences. The two self-protective coping strategies used were becoming a Superwoman of sorts and becoming desensitized and escaping. Self-protective coping involves strategies that are used to minimize the stressful effect of gendered microaggressions. Black women who cope by becoming a Black Superwoman take on multiple roles to demonstrate their strength and resilience. Other women cope by becoming desensitized and escaping, which involves downplaying the seriousness of the situation and attempting to find a way out.

It was built from 1882 to 1897. It is also known as Dry Dock Siding, South Brisbane Wharves Extension, and Stanley Street Terminus. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The first South Brisbane railway was constructed from South Brisbane Junction (now Corinda railway station) to Stanley Street in 1882-84. It was the outcome of late 1870s agitation by commercial interests, in particular West Moreton coal owners, for a link from the Ipswich line to deep water anchorage at South Brisbane. As approved by Queensland Parliament in 1881, the principal railyards were to be established at the water reserve at Woolloongabba, with a passenger line extension along Stanley Street terminating opposite the South Brisbane Dry Dock. Public opposition prevented the railway being run along Stanley Street. Instead, a branch line was constructed from the Woolloongabba railyards through a single-bore tunnel under Vulture Street to the river bank, then continued west to terminate just below Stanley Street. At the river a major coal wharf and sidings, which extended to the dry dock, were constructed. The contract for the main line to Stanley Street was let to Gilliver & Wockner in January 1882, but by May they were unable to continue the work and construction was taken over by the Railways Department. Acheson Overend & Co. were the successful tenderers for the coal wharf and sidings, with a contract price of ¬£11,830. The tender was accepted in December 1882 and work was completed by early May 1884. The South Brisbane line, coal wharf and sidings were opened on 2 June 1884, with passenger trains departing from the Stanley Street terminus three times daily except Sundays. This number doubled within the year. Although the station at Stanley Street catered only for passenger traffic, every train arriving had to be pushed back to Woolloongabba before another could use the line. The station's ability to handle increased traffic was minimal, and when the Melbourne Street extension and passenger terminal was opened on 21 December 1891, the Stanley Street station was closed. In 1894 parliament authorised the extension of the dry dock siding as far as the Victoria Bridge, to service the wharves and commercial enterprises along the river bank at South Brisbane. The contract was let to Kirk Brothers & Frew in May 1896, and the line was opened on 30 March 1897. The wharves extension served a host of major businesses until late 1969, by which time the demise of South Brisbane as a commercial and port facility forced its closure.  Description  Included in this listing are: * Former Stanley Street station platform (1883-4): Stanley Street station initially consisted of a single raised timber platform long on the southern side of the line, overlooking the dry dock. A timber station building long and wide was constructed by Worley and Whitehead in April 1884, but was removed in the 20th century. Remnant timber edgings to the station platform lie buried beneath infill. * Stanley Street retaining wall (1880s): Constructed of rough dressed freestone, the retaining wall effectively terminated the South Brisbane line. It runs along the northern side of Stanley Street above the former South Brisbane station and part of the dry dock reserve. Sections of the attached cast-iron fence remain, but the entry gates to the station have been removed. * Retaining walls (1883-5): Also constructed of rough dressed freestone, these retaining walls form the current southeastern and western boundaries of the dry dock, and were erected between 1883 and 1885. The southeastern wall appears to have been associated with the construction of the rail line to Stanley Street. Sections of this are rendered. Above this wall lies the path of the former South Brisbane line; below was the dry dock siding. * Paths of the former Stanley Street branch line (1882-3), dry dock siding (1882-4) and South Brisbane wharves extension (1896-7). Although the tracks have been removed, the paths and gradients remain. That of the 1896-97 extension of the dry dock siding has been asphalted. * Former railway overbridge at Sidon Street (1896-7): Constructed as part of the extension of the dry dock siding to the South Brisbane wharves, the overbridge necessitated cutting through the western retaining wall of the dry dock reserve and across Sidon Street. It was built of timber, wrought- iron, galvanised iron sheeting and cement concrete. The concrete abutments on the eastern side of what was formerly Sidon Street remain, but the overbridge is no longer visible and the cutting has been filled in.  Heritage listing  South Brisbane Railway Easement was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The South Brisbane Railway Easement, constructed in 1882-84, is significant historically as a collection of remnant structures and sites associated with South Brisbane's earliest rail network, constructed in the early 1880s. The place is important for its strong association with the commercial development of South Brisbane in the 1880s and 1890s. The South Brisbane Railway Easement is an integral element in the historic precinct centred on the South Brisbane Memorial Park, which includes the dry dock (Queensland Maritime Museum), the former South Brisbane Library, Cumbooquepa (Somerville House), the former South Brisbane Town Hall and Ship Inn. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. There is also potential to reveal sub- surface archaeological evidence.
