She was wife of Ari'imate of Huahine, founder of the Teururai dynasty which reigned on the Tahitian island of Huahin√© and Maia'o during the 19th century. She was Queen of Huahine and Maia'o and later Queen regnant in her own right.

His village has been destroyed by torrential rain, and he finds himself living in a world plagued by intolerance, shrouded in darkness, hungry, cold, and wet. Upon meeting and being reluctantly befriended by a hunter named Monser and Sajra, a woman, Yorsh learns of a prophecy and of his importance in saving the world of this Dark Age. To fulfill the prophecy and bring the world into an age where the sun will shine again, he must first find another bereaved creature: the last dragon.

The team played in the Ohio League, which was the direct predecessor to the modern National Football League. 1910 season The team was established and managed by Frank Schiffer, a former executive of the Shelby Athletic Club when the team first started paying players, including the first African-American professional football player, Charles Follis. The coach and quarterback of the 1910 Tigers team was Homer Davidson, a star player for the cross-town, Shelby Blues. Meanwhile Bullet Riley, who caught the first legal forward pass from Peggy Parratt while playing for the Massillon Tigers in 1906, signed with the team in 1910. The Tigers marched to an undefeated season in 1910. The team then signed a contract to play the Akron Indians on Thanksgiving Day. However Akron needed to play the Shelby Blues again after losing to the team the week before. The rematch was needed to decide the championship of the Ohio League. Indians were forced to cancel their game with the Tigers and forfeited their $100 guarantee. The Blues would defeat Akron 8-5 and claim the title. =Ohio League champions?= The Blue and Tigers both laid claim to the 1910 Ohio League title. The Blues were unbeaten with one tie and had those two big victories over the Akron Indians. Meanwhile the Tigers were unbeaten, untied, and unscored upon. The Blues played a harder schedule, but the Tigers won more convincingly. Frank Schiffer challenged the Blues to winner-take-all game for the title and suggested that the entire gate and $500 go to the winner. However having a championship game between the Tigers and Blues was impossible since too many players had seen action for both teams in 1910. Any game between the Blues and Tigers would force several players to choose sides, while the outcome of the game would depend simply on how their loyalties divvied up. It was later determined that since both teams were from Shelby, they should simply share the championship. The players for the Blues and Tigers were so intertwined that it was very hard to determine who was a Tiger and who was a Blues player. Both teams combined for a 13-0-1 record. 1911 In 1911, the Shelby Blues and Shelby Tigers merged, taking the \\"Blues\\" name.

RPKI provides a way to connect Internet number resource information (such as Autonomous System numbers and IP addresses) to a trust anchor. The certificate structure mirrors the way in which Internet number resources are distributed. That is, resources are initially distributed by the IANA to the regional Internet registries (RIRs), who in turn distribute them to local Internet registries (LIRs), who then distribute the resources to their customers. RPKI can be used by the legitimate holders of the resources to control the operation of Internet routing protocols to prevent route hijacking and other attacks. In particular, RPKI is used to secure the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) through BGP Route Origin Validation (ROV), as well as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND) for IPv6 through the Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol (SEND). The RPKI architecture is documented in RFC 6480. The RPKI specification is documented in a spread out series of RFCs: RFC 6481, RFC 6482, RFC 6483, RFC 6484, RFC 6485, RFC 6486, RFC 6487, RFC 6488, RFC 6489, RFC 6490, RFC 6491, RFC 6492, and RFC 6493. SEND is documented in RFC 6494 and RFC 6495. These RFCs are a product of the IETF's sidr working group, and are based on a threat analysis which was documented in RFC 4593. These standards cover BGP origin validation, while work on path validation (BGPSEC)Security Requirements for BGP Path Validation, S. Bellovin, R. Bush, D. Ward, October 19, 2011 is underway. Several implementations for prefix origin validation already exist.Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Router Implementation Report (RFC 7128), R. Bush, R. Austein, K. Patel, H. Gredler, M. Waehlisch, February, 2014  Resource Certificates and child objects  RPKI uses X.509 PKI certificates (RFC 5280) with extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers (RFC 3779). It allows the members of regional Internet registries, known as local Internet registries (LIRs), to obtain a resource certificate listing the Internet number resources they hold. This offers them validatable proof of holdership, though the certificate does not contain identity information. Using the resource certificate, LIRs can create cryptographic attestations about the route announcements they authorise to be made with the prefixes they hold. These attestations, called Route Origination AuthorizationsA Profile for Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), M. Lepinski, S. Kent, D. Kong, May 9, 2011 (ROAs), are described below. = Route Origination Authorizations = A Route Origination Authorization (ROA) states which autonomous system (AS) is authorised to originate certain IP prefixes. In addition, it can determine the maximum length of the prefix that the AS is authorised to advertise.  Maximum prefix length  The maximum prefix length is an optional field. When not defined, the AS is only authorised to advertise exactly the prefix specified. Any more specific announcement of the prefix will be considered invalid. This is a way to enforce aggregation and prevent hijacking through the announcement of a more specific prefix. When present, this specifies the length of the most specific IP prefix that the AS is authorised to advertise. For example, if the IP address prefix is \`10.0.0.0/16\` and the maximum length is 22, the AS is authorised to advertise any prefix under , as long as it is no more specific than \`/22\`. So, in this example, the AS would be authorised to advertise \`10.0.0.0/16\`, \`10.0.128.0/20\` or \`10.0.252.0/22\`, but not \`10.0.255.0/24\`.  RPKI route announcement validity  When a ROA is created for a certain combination of origin AS and prefix, this will have an effect on the RPKI validityValidation of Route Origination using the Resource Certificate PKI and ROAs, G. Huston, G. Michaelson, November 11, 2010 of one or more route announcements. They can be: * VALID  The route announcement is covered by at least one ROA * INVALID  The prefix is announced from an unauthorised AS. This means: * There is a ROA for this prefix for another AS, but no ROA authorising this AS; or * This could be a hijacking attempt  The announcement is more specific than is allowed by the maximum length set in a ROA that matches the prefix and AS * UNKNOWN  The prefix in this announcement is not covered (or only partially covered) by an existing ROA Note that invalid BGP updates may also be due to incorrectly configured ROAs.M. W√§hlisch, O. Maennel, T.C. Schmidt: \\"Towards Detecting BGP Route Hijacking using the RPKI\\", Proc. of ACM SIGCOMM, pp. 103‚Äì104, New York:ACM, August 2012.  Management  There are open source tools available to run the certificate authority and manage the resource certificate and child objects such as ROAs. In addition, the RIRs have a hosted RPKI platform available in their member portals. This allows LIRs to choose to rely on a hosted system, or run their own software.  Publication  The system does not use a single repository publication point to publish RPKI objects. Instead, the RPKI repository system consists of multiple repository publication points. Each repository publication point is associated with one or more RPKI certificates' publication points. In practice this means that when running a certificate authority, an LIR can either publish all cryptographic material themselves, or they can rely on a third party for publication. When an LIR chooses to use the hosted system provided by the RIR, in principle publication is done in the RIR repository.  Validation  Relying parties run local RPKI validation tools, which are pointed at the different RPKI trust anchors and using rsync gather all cryptographic objects from the different repositories used for publication. This creates a local validated cache which can be used for making BGP routing decisions.  Routing decisions  After validation of ROAs, the attestations can be compared to BGP routing and aid network operators in their decision making process. This can be done manually, but the validated prefix origin data can also be sent to a supported router using the RPKI to Router Protocol (RFC 6810), Cisco Systems offers native support on many platforms for fetching the RPKI data set and using it in the router configuration. Juniper offers support on all platforms that run version 12.2 or newer. Quagga obtains this functionality through BGP Secure Routing Extensions (BGP-SRx) or a RPKI implementation fully RFC-compliant based on RTRlib. The RTRlib provides an open source C implementation of the RTR protocol and prefix origin verification. The library is useful for developers of routing software but also for network operators.M. W√§hlisch, F. Holler, T.C. Schmidt, J.H. Schiller: \\"RTRlib: An Open-Source Library in C for RPKI-based Prefix Origin Validation, Proc. of USENIX Security Workshop CSET'13, Berkeley, CA, USA:USENIX Assoc., 2013. Developers can integrate the RTRlib into the BGP daemon to extend their implementation towards RPKI. Network operators may use the RTRlib to develop monitoring tools (e.g., to check the proper operation of caches or to evaluate their performance). RFC 6494 updates the certificate validation method of the Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol (SEND) security mechanisms for Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND) to use RPKI for use in IPv6. It defines a SEND certificate profile utilizing a modified RFC 6487 RPKI certificate profile which must include a single RFC 3779 IP address delegation extension.

It premiered on October 11, 2010 and ended with only one season on May 7, 2011. It is based on three characters that previously appeared in Skechers commercials (Z-Strap, Kewl Breeze and Elastika), although they have been redesigned. It is produced by MoonScoop Group and Skechers Entertainment. Plot The show is about three kids who get powers in a lab when Zevo compound covers them, due to an experiment done by the evil Doctor Stankfoot. Together they fight off mutant monsters that arise while dealing with their own teenage problems, including school, friends, and feelings. Episodes =Season 1 (2010-11)= Characters * Jason James/Z-Strap (voiced by Bryton James): A loner that loves to go free running over in Stankville. He met Ellie/Elastika and her brother Matt/Kewl Breeze when he almost ran them over at the chemical plant. He controls metal objects, and can turn his appendages into metal objects (spears, cages, blocks, etc.). After being Zevoed he began to hang out with the siblings and has become a friend and older sibling to them both from time to time. It might seem like Ellie and Matt annoy him, and sometimes they do, but deep down he cares; showing compassion is just hard for him since he's still bitter about his parents leaving him. He lives on a barge outside of New Eden City with his Grams. It is revealed that his greatest fear is being alone; however, he is able to overcome that. He also seems to harbor awkward, romantic feelings for Ellie; this was shown when they nearly kissed before Matt interrupted to inform them of Mayor Bronson's status as a mutant. He's an urban sports enthusiast, and is an excellent skate boarder and free runner. He's also an artist, something he seemed to get into when his parents were killed in action. * Matt Martin/Kewl Breeze (voiced by Dante Basco): Matt is the younger brother to Ellie/Elastika and looks up to Jason/Z-Strap like a role model and older brother. His powers involve manipulation of ice; and so far he's shown to be extremely powerful and skilled in their use. An example of his power level is shown when he instantly flash freezes a wall of ice taller and wider than the 50 ft tall robot brought to life by Jason's mutated blood. He's also nearly completely flash frozen Jason's barge, and has shown the ability to generate levels of cold close enough to liquid nitrogen that he can shatter metal. He was the one who accidentally released the Zevo Compound infecting him, Ellie and Jason. In the episode Welcome to Paradise Beach, it is revealed that his greatest fear is heat. Despite being the youngest of the group, Matt is easily the smartest, and shows super genius level intellect. So far he's invented a device that allowed Z-Strap to shrink himself to microscopic size due to his metal manipulation, an advanced communication system, a Heads Up Display for his shades, and more. Although many of his technological wonders seem to be trial and error, it's more his lack of resources than anything that hinder him. * Ellie Martin/Elastika (voiced by Kari Wahlgren): Ellie is a sporty busybody that always has something to do or somewhere to be. She seems to be involved in everything possible, and almost never has time for fun. Her hair has become incredibly strong and durable after her exposure to the Zevo Compound. Her hair can be spun around like a rotor blade and fly her through the air like a helicopter, compressed into a giant eardrum to enhance her hearing; her hair is even strong enough to toss a city bus and temporarily slow down a giant robot. Ellie is a talented gymnast. In the episode Welcome to Paradise Bay, it is revealed that her worst fear is failing. She is the older sister to Matt/Kewl Breeze and is good friends with Jason/Z-Strap. There seem to be hints of romantic feelings between Jason and Ellie, although they both deny them whenever anything about it is mentioned. * Grams (voiced by Sheryl Lee Ralph): She is Jason's grandmother and took care of him after his parents were sent out on their missions only to not return. She knows that Jason, Ellie, and Matt have super powers. She admits in the episode welcome to Paradise Beach that she has already faced all her greatest fears. In the episode Shutterbug, she says that she likes Ellie and Jason as a romantic couple. It is later revealed she knows more about Jason's parents and Operation Z than she is letting on. =Villains= * Dr. Stankfoot (voiced by Mark Hamill): Dr. Stankfoot was originally named Stanley K. Foot, the heir to the legacy of Foot family who founded Footville. A scientist working on the Zevo Compound, he caused the accident changing many people to mutants and turning him to stone. When he was revived by the Zevo Compound decades later, he realized his city had been demolished by Ronson in favor of New Eden City and made it his goal to reclaim his birthright from Ronson. He has shown the ability to create new Lifeforms (Blacktop and Dark Materia) to mutating someone (Mutating Ronson's aide to an insect humanoid like mutant). During his battle with Ronson in the season finale, Stankfoot was hit with Anti-Zevo and is reduced to slime as a result.  Blacktop: A brainless but powerful shape shifting mutant intentionally from the slime from the bottom of Stankfoot's foot. Being Stankfoot's first creation, Black is devotedly loyal and server as his creator' enforcer. He is constantly destroyed by Zevo-3, but is always getting recreated by Stankfoot, who views him as a kind of son, from whatever remained of him. * Dark Materia (voiced by Beverly Ann Myers): Dark Materia is a mutant-like homunculus made by Stankfoot from a combination of Dark Matter and pure Zevo compound to keep him company. However, extremely prideful and arrogant, Dark Materia saw Stankfoot as nothing than incompetent fool and harbored a deep hatred for the mad scientist to the point of killing him when given the chance. As a result, she allied herself Ronson a few times in order to perfect her unexpected ability to manipulate all Zevo-affected mutants. However, in the events of \\"Mutation Termination\\", she is killed by Stankfoot. * Mayor Brett Ronson III (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson): Brett is the one who led the creation of New Eden City, the second of the two main antagonists in the series. Knowing Stankfoot, Ronson may have played a hand in the Zevo Compound. As mayor of New Eden City, he spends time with the community, campaigns of a new city, and hires his city enforcers to aid in his propaganda against all mutants and mutant-related incidents, including the Zevo-3 team. However, Ronson hides a variety of dark secrets that only his enforcers know about: One being that he is a mutant with a tumor-like creature emerging from his back that he treats as a separate entity despite being an aspect of himself. Another dark secret is his master plan is brainwashing people to share his views, his workers being among them. Though unaware of Stankfoot's return at first, Ronson later learns of it while attempting to capture Dark Materia for his agenda before she is killed off. During his own battle with Stankfoot in the season finale, Ronson was hit with Anti-Zevo and becomes a normal human again as he resumes his agenda with Stankfoot no longer a hindrance. =Supporting characters= * Sagacity Acumen (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson): The guru-like owner of the 6/10 convenience store in New Eden City. He and Grams have been friends for many years and acted as her eyes and ears in New Eden City. He also acts as an advice guru to Jason when he has a problem. He also owns a small piece of hardened Zevo Compound, which, once held, can give brief visions of the future. * Florence \\"Flo\\" Cara (voiced by Grey DeLisle): A brave-hearted paramedic in New Eden City, who occasionally helps out Zevo-3. She seems to know more about Zevo-3 than she appears to be letting on. * Cotilla (voiced by Grey DeLisle): Ellie's best friend and the local gossip. She is very boy-crazy and frequently calls cute boys \\"hotties\\". In the episode Welcome to Paradise Bay, it is revealed that her worst fear is having no boys around at all. She also seems to harbour schoolgirl feelings for Jason and his alter-ego, Z-Strap. * Angel (voiced by Pamela Adlon): Ellie's other best friend and a gloomy Goth girl. Not much is known about her, except that in the episode Welcome to Paradise Bay, it is revealed that her worst fear is wearing something colorful. * The Moloks: A group of mutants who were fused to parts of the Footville Subway by the Zevo Compound. They live underground and act quite primitively,  Bug (voiced by Benjamin Diskin): A green bug-like mutant who lives in Stankville and is the son of the leader of the Moloks. He is very skilled and a bit of a loner, he left the Moloks some time ago. But after being forced to help Z-Strap and Elastika, he returned to them. Now he is an ally to Zevo-3 and continues to have feelings for Ellie, as shown in episode Heart of Darkness.  Bobby (voiced by Benjamin Diskin): A small blue mutant with metallic limbs and helmet. He and Bug share a \\"Big- Brother/Little Brother\\" relationship and he seems to relate to Kewl Breeze. At first, all he could do was make the sound of a Subway stop signal, but thanks to Grams and Matt, he gained the ability to talk. * The Mengalsons: A family of strange-looking, but quite sentient mutants, who live in a rundown old motel in an old part of Footville. Brett Ronson III tried to tear down their motel, but thanks to Zevo-3, he failed.  George: The patriarch of the family, a green, slime mutant wearing a white shirt and blue pants.  Beatrice: George's wife, a tentacled, worm-like mutant with a pink dress and headband  Thomas and Thomas: George and Beatrice's twin sons, both of them round purple, ball-like mutants with short arms and long legs. They both appear to be very immature and goofy.  Granny: George's mother and grandmother to his kids, when the Zevo Compound mutated the family, she was fused into the floor and gives the appearance of a green shag rug with a face.  Caroline (voiced by Tara Strong): George and Beatrice's daughter and Thomas and Thomas' sister, roughly around Matt/Kewl Breeze's age it seems. Of all the Mengalsons, she is the most unusual. For one thing, she seems the most humanoid (not counting her tail, pointed ears and green coloring) and for another, like Zevo-3, the Zevo Compound gave her special powers. She is able to heal any injury (but not always completely). She is very polite and grateful for when Zevo-3 saved her home and family. Matt developed a crush on Caroline the moment he saw her and from what is seen in her appearances so far, the feeling appears to be mutual (In both her appearances, she gave him a kiss on the cheek).

Thus was started an unbroken series of lecture seasons and field excursions organised by the Tain & District Field Club. TDFC members met in Tain Royal Academy until recently when the refurbished hall at the Tain Parish Church became the regular venue for lectures. The intent throughout has been to deliver erudite lectures from specialists in their field and make field excursions to sites with Natural History interest; the publicly stated aim is \\"To encourage interest in natural history in this area by surveying and recording animals and plants and helping projects organised by conservation organisations\\". Tain & District Field Club is fortunate in its location, surrounded by rich farmland, both mixed and monoculture, firths, woodlands, rivers and lochs such as Loch Eye, an important area for wintering greylag geese and whooper swans. Other important local sites where TDFC takes an active interest have been nesting ospreys, capercaillie (Scottish Gaelic: an coileach-fraoich) strongholds, Scottish crossbill habitat, and extensive mudflats important for feeding wading birds.  TDFC Survey and Recording Activities  With their specific interests and skills TDFC members have managed or contributed to activities such as bird-ringing, cetacean-watch, osprey-watch, amphibian & reptile census, biological surveying, habitat recording, and site monitoring, largely participating in survey work co- ordinated by the Highland Biological Recording Group. Tain & District Field Club members : *contribute to butterfly and moth surveys and site monitoring for Butterfly Conservation Scotland; *participate in estuary bird counts in the local Firths, bird atlas surveys and bird ringing projects for the British Trust for Ornithology; *participate in goose counts on nearby major flyways and winter feeding grounds for the Wetlands & Wildfowl Trust; *contribute locally to the work of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds; *provide wardening and publicity work on harrier and osprey watches in conjunction with the Forestry Commission; *instigated one of the first surveys of the spread of speckled wood butterfly prior to other organisations' involvement. *carried out bird counts for the Forestry Commission in Strathrory.

The Dallas Morning News, 16 Sep 2018. Retrieved 2018-09-17. was an American civil rights activist and women's rights advocate from Dallas, Texas, best known for her work in support of securing the legal right of women to control their reproduction. Whitehill was present at the U.S. Supreme Court during the Roe v. Wade court case that confirmed the legality of abortion. Personal history Her mother, Myrtle Bales Bulkley, marched for women's suffrage as a young woman and remained a vocal supporter of women's rights until her death in 1990. A native of New York, Virginia Whitehill graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1950 with a bachelor's degree in history. She moved to Dallas in 1960 with her husband, James. She was the mother of two daughters and was a grandmother. Advocacy for women's right to abortion On January 13, 1970 Whitehill spoke at a meeting of the Women's Alliance of Dallas' First Unitarian Church. At the meeting she argued that recent cases on abortion that had gone before the US Supreme Court suggested that legislative change in the field would be easier to accomplish through the medium of the courts. In an interview in 2005, Whitehill said \\"There's nothing more important to a woman than controlling her own fertility. The vote and birth control are the cornerstones of the emancipation of women.\\" Links to organizations In 1969, Virginia Whitehill founded the Dallas Committee to Study Abortion. She was also the Texas Citizens for Abortion Education (TCAE) state coordinator in 1974. As a member of the Dallas Junior League, Whitehill also helped found Family Place, a refuge for women escaping domestic violence. Whitehill noted there was some resistance to the idea, however she argued \\"...it wasn't about women's rights. It was about fighting crime, and gosh, maybe it would be good to be safe from crime in your own home.\\" Whitehill was a co-founder of the Dallas Women's Coalition, Women's Issues Network, Dallas Women's Foundation, Women's Southwest Federal Credit Union, Dallas Women's Political Caucus, Veteran Feminist of America (Dallas) and the Women's Equality Action League.

It was written by series creator Brad Falchuk, directed by Paris Barclay, and aired on Fox in the United States on November 30, 2010. In \\"Special Education\\", the McKinley High School glee club New Directions competes in the Sectionals round of show choir competition against the Hipsters and the Dalton Academy Warblers, while dealing with internal feuding that threatens to rip the club apart. The episode shows the former member of New Directions, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), at his new school Dalton Academy, where he joins the rival Warblers. With his departure, New Directions must find a new twelfth member to remain eligible for the competition. Club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) decides to feature overlooked performers from the group for Sectionals, to the consternation of the usual lead singers, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). The episode received a wide range of reviews, with a small majority commenting favorably; some viewed it as a lesser version of the first season's Sectionals episode. By contrast, the six songs covered during the show received generally favorable reviews, with the most praise going to \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" and \\"Valerie\\" as performed by New Directions, and \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\" as sung by the Warblers. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 11.68 million American viewers and garnered a 4.6/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, up significantly from the previous episode, \\"Furt\\". Plot The show choir Sectionals competition is imminent,The first Sectionals event was seen in the season one episode entitled \\"Sectionals\\". and the New Directions glee club is one below the required minimum of twelve members now that Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) has enrolled at Dalton Academy, home of their Sectionals' rivals the Warblers. At club director Will Schuester's (Matthew Morrison) behest, Puck (Mark Salling) attempts to recruit his football teammates, but they lock him in a port-a- potty. He is rescued the next day by AV Club president and wrestler Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), and she agrees to join New Directions, though he has to bribe her first. Will invites school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) to accompany him to Sectionals. She accepts, and suggests he consider featuring other club members instead of his usual choices, co-captains Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). Will gives the lead vocals for one song to duets competition winners Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet),The duets competition occurred in the season two episode entitled \\"Duets\\". which upsets Rachel and Finn, while Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.) are given lead dancing roles on another number. When Brittany admits she is nervous about performing, her boyfriend Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) gives her a \\"magic comb\\" to boost her confidence. She and Mike commence time-consuming rehearsals for their dance routine, and Mike's girlfriend Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) suspects that they are having an affair; when Artie confronts Brittany about it, she confesses that she has been avoiding him because she lost his comb. Artie admits that the comb was never magical, and tells Brittany that she is magic. Kurt attends his first meeting with the Dalton Academy Warblers. He learns that the setlist for Sectionals is selected by a council of upperclassmen, and is offered a chance to audition for a solo at Sectionals. He visits Rachel for advice, and at her recommendation sings \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" from the musical Evita. Kurt is not given a solo, and his friend Blaine (Darren Criss) suggests that he try to fit in rather than stand out. Santana (Naya Rivera) tells Rachel that she and Finn had sex the previous spring, and Rachel is furious that Finn's claim to be a virgin was a lie. Emma counsels them, and then realizes that she should not attend Sectionals with Will since her boyfriend Carl (John Stamos) would be hurt; she and Carl fly to Las Vegas, Nevada for the weekend. At sectionals, the Hipsters and the Warblers perform first, the latter singing Train's \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\" with Blaine on lead. Despite much backstage drama, the New Directions set goes smoothly, with Quinn and Sam performing \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\" and Santana singing lead on Amy Winehouse's cover of The Zutons' \\"Valerie\\"; Brittany and Mike receive several bursts of applause for their dancing. New Directions and the Warblers tie for first place, which means that both groups will advance to the Regionals competition. Emma tells Will that she married Carl in Las Vegas, and despite his shock, Will says he is happy for her. Finn breaks up with Rachel after she confesses that she made out with Puck to get back at him over Santana. New Directions performs Florence and the Machine's \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" to celebrate the club's competition survival, with Tina and Mercedes (Amber Riley) singing lead. Production The competitors for Sectionals were announced three episodes prior in \\"Never Been Kissed\\": the a cappella Warblers from Dalton Academy, an all-male institution in Westerville‚Äîthey were seen in that episode performing the song \\"Teenage Dream\\"‚Äîand the Hipsters from the Warren Township continuing education program, which consists of seniors working toward earning General Educational Development diplomas. While Criss sings lead on the Warblers song, the background vocals are sung by the Tufts Beelzebubs, a male a cappella group from Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, not the actors playing the Warblers on screen. The Beelzebubs had not yet met Criss at the time the episode aired. The scenes of the Warblers performance of \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\" were filmed in a theater over the course of two fifteen-hour days, according to Chris Mann, one of the actors: from the front on the first day, and from the back on the second. Cheyenne Jackson as Dustin Goolsby and John Stamos as Carl Howell were originally supposed to have scenes in this episode‚Äîthe Fox publicity included a photograph of a scene between Dustin and Will‚Äîbut Jackson's was cut entirely, and only a brief shot of Stamos embracing Mays as Emma was retained in the final version. Recurring characters in this episode include glee club members Mike Chang (Shum) and Sam Evans (Overstreet), school bullies Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and Azimio (James Earl), Stamos as Howell, and Criss as Blaine Anderson, lead singer of the Warblers. Vicki Woodlee, mother of Glee choreographer Zach Woodlee, plays one of the Hipsters; as the youngest of the performers at 60, she had to wear a great deal of makeup to emulate an older person's appearance, including \\"pounds of powder\\". Zach Woodlee instructed those cast as Hipsters, the oldest of whom was 83, to limit their dance movements to seem more realistic. Scenes were filmed over the course of four days. Actress and former American Bandstand member Bunny Gibson plays another group member. Co-stars include Fink, who appears as new glee club member Lauren Zizes, Telly Leung and Titus Makin, Jr., who return as Warblers Wes and David, respectively, and Riker Lynch, Eddy Martin and Curt Mega, who debut as Warblers Jeff, Thad and Nick, respectively. \\"Special Education\\" features cover versions of six songs: \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" from the musical Evita, Mike + The Mechanics' \\"The Living Years\\", Train's \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\", \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\" from the film Dirty Dancing, \\"Valerie\\" by The Zutons (although specifically a cover of the version by Mark Ronson featuring Amy Winehouse), and Florence and the Machine's \\"Dog Days Are Over\\". Each song was released as a single, available for digital download, with two separate versions of \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" released --one by Chris Colfer (Kurt) and the other by Lea Michele (Rachel). \\"Valerie\\" and \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\" are included on the fifth soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 4, released on November 26, 2010, and \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\" was included on the seventh soundtrack album, Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers, released on April 19, 2011. Reception =Ratings and viewership= \\"Special Education\\" was first broadcast on November 30, 2010 in the United States on Fox. It received a 4.6/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and attracted over 11.68 million American viewers during its initial airing, and thus won its time slot despite airing simultaneously with network specials, including Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer on CBS, Christmas In Rockefeller Center on NBC, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Shrek the Halls on ABC, and CW's usual offering, One Tree Hill. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were up significantly from those of the previous episode, \\"Furt\\", which was watched by 10.41 million American viewers and acquired a 4.0/12 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic upon first airing on television on November 23, 2010. In Canada, 2.32 million viewers watched the episode, ranking second for the week. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.602 million viewers (2.218 million on E4, and 384,000 on E4+1), which made it the most-watched show on cable for the week. =Critical reception= \\"Special Education\\" received mixed reviews from television critics. The most enthusiastic reviewers were from The Atlantic, where both Kevin Fallon and Patrick Burns declared it the \\"best episode of Glee all season\\", and Meghan Brown suggested that the show should \\"just do competition episodes from now on\\". Aly Semigran of MTV was similarly laudatory, and said that the show was \\"back in top form\\"; she added that the episode \\"felt very reminiscent of the magic the first season provided\\". Others were more tempered in their praise. James Poniewozik of Time said the episode was \\"grounded\\" and \\"solid-if-not-spectacular\\", and highlighted how Glee \\"has developed into a broad ensemble, where any of several characters is capable of taking the spotlight, even an originally comic-relief character like Brittany.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson both liked the episode‚ÄîVanDerWerff gave it a \\"B+\\"‚Äîbut they, like Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone who was less complimentary, were disappointed that it failed to measure up to the last time New Directions competed in Sectionals. VanDerWerff wrote, \\"When the show [‚Ä¶] remains, at some level, a show about a bunch of kids who just love to sing and dance and maybe have wacky adventures on the side, it remains fundamentally strong, as it does tonight.\\" She also stated, \\"The fact that the Warblers and New Directions tied, while probably necessary for whatever reason, is ridiculously anticlimactic and keeps this episode from an A- pretty much singlehandedly.\\" Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times was disappointed with almost everything, and said the episode \\"felt more like a long, slow letdown after a season of gleeful highs\\". She added, \\"New Directions' sectionals performance wasn't a total fumble, but it wasn't the touchdown you might've hoped for either\\", and of the long-awaited opportunity to see other members featured in competition: \\"the anticipated shining moment turned out to be so dull.\\" Reiter was one of a very few critics to note the absence of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester in the episode, and only when she lamented the \\"relative lack of humor\\". Futterman merely remarked on Sue's non-appearance in passing; she came to the conclusion that \\"we got a spazzy, unfocused hour at the expense of emotional investment\\", and though Anthony Benigno of the Daily News complimented the \\"solid acting\\", he also wrote that \\"this is the first time the show's started to feel genuinely boring as opposed to, you know, gleeful.\\" He made a general complaint as well: \\"This show is starting to suffer in a big way from making the music secondary to the plot.\\" Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. He said that the show \\"tried to make it all work, and while the hour was enjoyable enough, each storyline felt just a little bit shy of going from good to great.\\" A few reviewers remarked on how the Hipsters seemed to be a reflection of the New Directions crew in fifty years, with Futterman getting into specifics: \\"We see future Rachel start the number with a cane and future Mercedes break through to finish the song off with a riff, and it's hard not to be endeared to them.\\" Poniewozik wrote that Rachel's \\"silent reminder to Kurt to smile on stage was a perfect, sweet little moment\\", a sentiment shared by Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly. Poniewozik also noted that \\"Lea Michele had some of her strongest non-singing moments of the season by showing not just how Rachel dealt with her problems with Finn but with being on the periphery of the group.\\" The storyline that featured the disintegration of the Rachel‚ÄìFinn relationship, when commented on at all, was viewed unfavorably; VanDerWerff called it a \\"stupid twist\\". Brown praised the addition of Fink as Lauren to New Directions, and declared, \\"I hope she's on the team for keeps\\", while Poniewozik was pleased that \\"the episode used Lauren for comedy without simply making her the butt of jokes\\". Brown also wrote, \\"Kurt's arc was subtler this week, and thereby about 50 times more interesting. I [‚Ä¶] am impressed that Glee handling his acclimation to Dalton so truthfully.\\" Canning was similarly impressed, and called Kurt at Dalton \\"the most solid story\\" of the episode. There was little approval among reviewers for the \\"canary in a cage\\" metaphor in the scene between Kurt and Blaine at the end of the episode, with Kurt the \\"canary\\" in his new Dalton cage; Hankinson characterized it as \\"super ham-fisted\\", and others were nearly as harsh. =Music and performances= The solo by Santana (Rivera, pictured), her first on the show, garnered rave reviews. The musical performances in this episode were mostly praised by critics, though there was little said about the quality of the abbreviated performance by the Hipsters in competition. There was near-universal approval for the first song heard, \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\", which Stack called \\"totally beautiful\\" and gave an \\"A-\\"; he, like Burns, who said it was \\"fantastic\\", loved having \\"Rachel and Kurt get a chance to sing together\\". Jen Harper of BuddyTV echoed Kurt's words in the episode; she said \\"Rachel really is as talented as she is irritating\\", but wished she \\"didn't always look like she's crying while she's singing\\", and added that she was \\"really digging Kurt in a lower register\\". Futterman noted that Rachel, as is usual with her \\"power ballads\\", \\"uses the time to grapple with the latest obstacle to her future stardom, while we see Kurt deliver a clear, restrained take. Benigno called Michele's voice \\"astounding\\", and added that her solo alternated \\"with Kurt's audition with the Warblers, which is predictably outstanding\\", and gave the song a \\"B+\\". Even those who disliked the song or the composer were won over by the performance: Berk gave it three stars out of five, and Burns thought it was \\"fantastic\\"; both liked the song's tag-team presentation. The performance of Train's \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\" by the Dalton Academy Warblers received even more praise than \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\". Benigno called it flawless, and gave it an \\"A++\\", and Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it gave it her \\"top prize\\" of the night. Berk gave it four stars out of five, Burns said \\"the Warblers sounded fantastic and fun\\", and Harper said she loved it, and that, like the audience on the show, she \\"would have given it\\" a \\"standing ovation\\". Stack said he \\"sorta\\" hated the song \\"from sheer overexposure\\", but \\"Darren Criss sold it for me with his choreography and acting\\", and gave it a \\"B+\\". Pat Monahan, the lead singer of Train, said: \\"Loved it! I thought they did an amazing job.\\" The praise was more tepid for Sam and Quinn's \\"(I've Had) the Time of My Life\\". Benigno called it \\"solid\\", but added \\"overkill knocks it down to a solid B.\\" Both Futterman and Stack said the number \\"fell a little flat\\", though Stack said the duo had \\"great physical chemistry\\". Fallon characterized it as an \\"adorable duet\\". Berk gave it five stars of five, his best grade for the episode, and called it \\"oozy, curdling perfection\\", while Reiter was the least impressed, and wrote that their \\"voices (and romantic interplay) seemed wan and thin.\\" The New Directions closing number at Sectionals, \\"Valerie\\", received the most commentary, with Santana's solo given enthusiastic praise, though Brittany and Mike's dancing was also lauded. Hankinson, who had tepidly called songs \\"nice\\" up to this point, shifted gears and said, \\"Then Santana burns the roof down with a rendition of Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie'. It was awesome.\\" Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal echoed that fervor: \\"But then Santana came on and killed. With an on-spot rendition of Mark Ronson/Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie,' and wearing a Snooki bun, Santana was electrifying behind the mic, in an energizing display that revved up the audience\\", and added, \\"Brittany and Mike's pas de deux rocked\\". Benigno opined that \\"Brittany and Mike Chang handle the moves (extraordinarily well), but the vocals here are what steal it. Naya Rivera (Santana) is completely outstanding on lead vocals, and I can't understand why she hasn't gotten a solo before this\\"; he gave it an \\"A\\". Stack was slightly less generous with an \\"A-\\", and wrote that it was a \\"great song choice for Santana\\"; he gave \\"bonus points for the phenomenal Mike/Brittany choreography\\", while Harper said that their dancing \\"totally made the song\\". Nguyen liked the dancing, but she was critical of how the song sounded, as she felt \\"it lacked something and didn't really feel worthy of the standing O\\", while Futterman said \\"Santana's sassy vocals are a perfect echo of Winehouse's, but the rest of the song feels a bit like a circus\\". Reiter felt the entire song \\"seemed kind of tacked on\\", both the dancing and Santana's solo. \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" was the favorite song of several reviewers, including Hankinson, who said \\"it was the exact brand of high- energy jubilation that I love the most.\\" Harper was also enthusiastic: \\"This performance for me represents what I like about New Directions‚Äîand why Kurt needs to come back asap. Everyone got to do their own individual thing, yet they still work really well as a group. I give it best song of the night.\\" In Semigran's view, \\"From the cute choreographed claps to the unconventional (but oddly fitting) choice to have Tina and Mercedes sing the tune, I wish they'd save this one for regionals. It was a winner\\", while VanDerWerff wrote, \\" 'Dog Days Are Over' is right in this show's wheelhouse, so, naturally, it hits the song out of the park.\\" Benigno gave the song a \\"B+\\", and Berk awarded three stars out of five, while Stack gave it an \\"A\\", and said series creator Ryan Murphy \\"chose the perfect gals to pull off this cover.\\" =Chart history= Five of the seven cover versions released as singles debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and appeared on other musical charts. The show's rendition of \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" debuted at number twenty-two on both the Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100,Peak chart positions for season 2 singles in the United States: \\"Dog Days Are Over\\", \\"Valerie\\", \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\", \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" and \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\" and pushed the original version of the song by Florence and the Machine ahead of it to number twenty-one on the Hot 100, up from number fifty-eight in the previous week. The other songs on the Hot 100 were \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\" at number twenty-nine, which also made number thirty-two on the Canadian Hot 100; \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\" at number thirty-eight, which also made number thirty-nine on the Canadian Hot 100; \\"Valerie\\" at number fifty-four, which also made number seventy on the Canadian Hot 100; and \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" in the Lea Michele version, at number ninety-seven.

At the time of his death, Mallaby was the Commanding Officer (CO) of the 49th Indian Infantry Brigade. Mallaby's death became a major event of hostilities in Surabaya surrounding Indonesian Independence, triggering a retaliatory military action by British forces in the city.  Biography  Mallaby was born to actor and acting company manager William Calthorpe Mallaby (n√© William Calthorpe Deeley- his father insisted on a stage name;Blockbuster!

His younger brother was the public servant George Mallaby, British High Commissioner to New Zealand from 1957 to 1959.https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31402 He attended the Wellington Cadet College in India and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on the Unattached List, Indian Army on 1 October 1918, being admitted to the Indian Army on 8 October 1918 and was appointed to the 27th Punjabis. He transferred to the 67th Punjabis (later 1st battalion, 2nd Punjab regiment) on 20 July 1919 and promoted lieutenant on 1 October 1919. He served in Waziristan between 1921 and 1924. He received promotion to captain on 1 October 1924. Mallaby attended Camberley Staff College between 1930‚Äì1931 and was appointed a General Staff Officer, 3rd grade on 5 February 1933, being promoted to General Staff Officer, 2nd grade (for RAF co-operation duties), on 1 April 1933. This appointment lasted until 4 February 1937. He was promoted brevet major on 1 July 1935 and substantive major on 1 October 1936. He was appointed a General Staff Officer, 2nd grade at the War Office in London on 1 March 1938 (being promoted war substantive Lt-Col on 15 August 1941) later being appointed Deputy Director of Military Operation in the rank of Brigadier and remained at the War Office until 1942. He was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire OBE as Major, temporary Lt-Col, acting Brigadier. Mallaby returned to India and served as Major and second in command of the 6th battalion, 2nd Punjab Regiment, from April to August 1943. In August 1943 he was given command of a battalion of the Hyderabad Regiment but after only 6 weeks in command he was appointed Director of Military Operations at G. H. Q. India with the acting rank of Major General. He was promoted from acting to temporary Major-General and war substantive Colonel on 1 March 1944. In order to obtain operational experience he dropped in rank to temporary Brigadier in July 1944 and was given command of the 49th Indian Infantry Brigade, then serving with the 23rd Indian Division. His substantive (permanent) rank was advanced to lieutenant-colonel in October 1944. Mallaby was appointed a Companion of The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire in the London Gazette of 1 January 1945 as a temporary Brigadier. He led the 49th Indian Infantry Brigade to Indonesia in the middle of the national revolution, to find and repatriate former Japanese prisoners of war. He arrived in Surabaya on 25 October 1945. Upon landing, he sent Captain Douglas MacDonald to contact the leader of the revolutionaries, Moestopo; Moestopo stated that they would not oppose the British forces. Mallaby and his squadron worked under constant supervision by the Indonesians, whom he later told that he was focused on finding the POWs. However, the situation became more heated on 27 October after Mallaby interpreted pamphlets demanding the immediate surrender of the Indonesians' weapons, signed by General Douglas Hawthorn, as an order. Communications were broken between Mallaby's forces and the Indonesians, and the following day the Indonesians began launching attacks on the 49th Brigade. To quench the fighting, Mallaby was able to contact General Hawthorn through an intermediary and arrange a meeting between himself and President Sukarno, where they negotiated a ceasefire. = Death = The burnt-out car of Brigadier Mallaby where he was killed on 30 October 1945. Mallaby was killed on 30 October 1945. At the time, he was travelling about Surabaya under a white flag to spread the news about the cease fire agreement and rescue some stranded Mahratta troops, despite being warned of the danger by Force 136 troops. When his car approached the British troops' post in the International building near the Jembatan Merah (\\"Red Bridge\\"), his car was surrounded by Indonesian Republican militia. Fearing that their commander was about to be attacked, the British troops in the International building, led by Major Venu K. Gopal, fired into the air to disperse the Indonesian militia. The militia, thinking that the British were taking hostile action, fired back at the British troops. Captain R.C. Smith, who was in the stationary car, reported that a young Republican shot and killed Mallaby after a short conversation. Smith then reported throwing a grenade from the car in the direction of where he thought the shooter had hidden. Although he was not sure whether or not it hit its target, the explosion caused the back seat of the car to ignite. Other accounts, according to the same source, stated that it was the explosion and not a shooter that killed Mallaby. Whatever the exact circumstances of his demise, Mallaby's death was a significant turning point for the hostilities in Surabaya, and a catalyst for the battle to come. The British ordered an Indonesian surrender, and on 10 November they rolled out a large retaliatory attack. His death also caused the British command to lose trust in the Indonesian politicians. He received a posthumous Mention In Despatches in April 1946 as a Temporary Brigadier.  Personal life  Mallaby married Margaret Catherine Jones (known as Mollie) on 9 April 1935 at St Mark's Church, North Audley Street, London. Mallaby is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery in Menteng Pulo, Jakarta. His son, Sir Christopher Mallaby, was later British Ambassador to Germany and to France.  Views of Mallaby  Patrick Heren, writing for Standpoint, notes that Mallaby was considered a \\"thinking soldier\\" who preferred discourse over fighting.

The ministry is headed by Ogtay Shiraliyev. History The Ministry of Healthcare was established on June 17, 1918 by the decree of Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic led by Fatali Khan Khoyski. The first appointed minister was Khudadat Rafibeyli, who had graduated from Kharkov University in 1903 and was the most experienced surgeon in the country at the time. The ministry consisted of five departments, including city healthcare department, healthcare statistics, therapy, rural healthcare and veterinary offices. The medical care was provided to the population free of charge while the authorities built new hospitals, laboratories, medicine warehouses and purchased medical equipment. Throughout the 23-month-long existence of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, 33 hospitals operated in Azerbaijani provinces with each having 1 doctor, 2 paramedics, 1 gynecologist and one nurse conducting vaccinations. According to statistics, there was only one doctor per every 75,000 citizens. Due to the shortage, the Azerbaijani parliament included building of 35 new hospitals and 56 paramedical office in 1920 fiscal budget committing AZN 43,321,950. During the Soviet rule of Azerbaijan, new hospitals and pharmacies were built. State pharmacy and analytical laboratories was established in Baku in order to prepare medicines, bacteriological drugs, syrups and investigate medical records during the issues relating with crime. In 1960-70s, the medical sector was enhanced and new ambulance services opened for public. The ministry today operates under statute signed by President Heydar Aliyev on December 29, 1998.  The statute of the Ministry of Health  The presidential decree was signed on May 25, 2006 by Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev and covers issues such as the structure and other issues relating with the Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan. Other two statutes accepted in 1998 and 2005 were invalidated after the acceptance of new statute numbered 413. In accordance with the statute the structure of the ministry was submitted and staff of the chairmanship was defined as 87 people. Structure Main functions of the ministry are organization and regulation of healthcare system in the country to provide sufficient medical care to the population; preparation and implementation of state healthcare programs; conduct activities for improvement of services by medical companies in both state and private sector; regulation of sanitary- epidemiology stations in the country; preparation of programs on parenthood and family planning; provision of medical drugs, bacteriological and antivirus products to hospitals; regulations and development of pharmacy offices networks; research and development of medical equipment manufacturing; prevention of dangerous diseases in the country and so forth.  International relations  In order of improvement of healthcare in the country, Ministry of Healthcare Azerbaijan cooperates with a number of international organizations and shares experiences with foreign countries. = Rostrapovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation = During the years of 2010-2012 the Ministry of Healthcare of Azerbaijan cooperated with Rostrapovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation. Parties signed an agreement on ‚ÄúDiagnosis of pregnant women against HepB and HIV viruses and prevention of newborn against HepB.‚Äù At the same time, ministry organized an immunization campaign and vaccine program with support of foundation. As a result, indications of the diseases such as measles, mumps and parotid decreased in the country. = World Health Organization = Since 2006 Ministry of Healthcare Azerbaijan has been represented on European Region‚Äôs Standing Committee of the Regional Committee and twice on WHO‚Äôs Executive Board. 61st session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe was held in Azerbaijan in 2011. During the meeting public health experts and ministers of health from 53 countries signed an agreement relating to the public health problems and current health threats in European region. At the same time, Health 2020 ‚Äì a new European Health Policy Framework was also discussed during the session and accepted Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. Country office of the World Health Organization in Azerbaijan was established in June 1994 in Baku. The office carries out implementation of WHO programs in the country with staff consists of six people. Since 2006 Azerbaijan has started HIV treatment services in the country with the support of WHO. Current prior programs are carried out in the field of healthcare such as, noncommunicable diseases, maternal and child health, health system strengthening, tuberculosis, immunization and tobacco control. = Organization of Islamic Cooperation = Ministry of Healthcare Azerbaijan cooperates with the member countries of OIC and participates in sessions of ministries of health.

Western Cattle in Storm is one of nine commemorative postage stamps in the series, which marked the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition held in Omaha, Nebraska. While the entire Trans-Mississippi Issue set has been praised for its quality, viewed by generations of U. S. stamp specialists as \\"one of the most beautiful sets of postage stamps our country has ever issued,\\"Randy L. Neil with Jack Rosenthal, The Trans-Mississippi Issue of 1898 (Andrew Levitt, Danbury Connecticut, 1997) a: p. xv; b, c, d: p. 145. the $1 stamp, also called the Black Bull, stands out from the rest. The breed of cattle used in the issue were meant to represent the ruggedness of the American West, but actually derive from the Highlands of Scotland. That's because the design originated in a John MacWhirter painting (1878) depicting cattle in a winter storm in central Scotland. An engraving of this painting by one C. O. Murray was published at least twice in England, and this image, copied, without the permission of the painting's owner, Lord Blythswood, was used by an American cattle company on its calendar as a trademark of sorts. \\"MacWhirter, however, was a Scot, and his painting, entitled The Vanguard, was soon discovered to have been a depiction of Scottish cattle in a storm in Scotland,\\" according to a company called Chicago Stamps. \\"It was actually painted in a small farmhouse near the Scottish highland town of Calendar. The scene did not depict an event west of the Mississippi, but it might have been, and few really cared about this detail, for cattle were an important part of the western U.S. economy.\\" (Note: the correct spelling of the town is Callander.) This image caught the attention of the Post Office Department and Raymond Ostrander Smith, the staff designer of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing at the time, and it was adopted for the $1 design. Little did the designer know that the scene depicted was in Scotland, not the Western U.S., as was supposed. A full apology was later issued to the owner of the painting. Both the frame and the vignette of the stamp were engraved by Marcus W. Baldwin; the numerals and lettering were the work of Douglas S. Ronaldson.  Production and printing  Ironically, the feature that gives this stamp its singular distinction and beauty, its coal-black color, was decided upon only a few days before the issue went to press; previous versions seen in surviving essays are far less dramatic in appearance. The $1 stamp and the eight others in the Trans- Mississippi series were originally to be two-toned, with all the vignettes printed in black and the various frames printed in different colors. In preliminary bi-color die essays, a brownish-purple frame surrounds the cattle herd. However, after the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in April, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing found its resources severely overtaxed by the need for additional revenue stamps, and so, elected to simplify the printing process for the Trans-Mississippi series by issuing the stamps in single colors. The color initially chosen for the $1 value, announced by the Post Office on May 16, was light brown. Only on May 26, four days before printing began, did the public learn that the denomination would instead be printed with black ink. The entire printing run of Western Cattle in Storm lasted three days, from June 1‚Äì3, 1898. In all, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing shipped 56,900 copies of the stamp to post offices.  Distribution  The earliest known date of delivery to postmasters of stamps of the Trans- Mississippi Issue is June 15, 1898. The assigned first day of issue was June 17. There had been considerable pre-issue publicity regarding the series, which resulted in an early rush on the initial limited supplies available at post offices. But such interest was short-lived, especially as post offices replenished their stocks, the novelty of the new stamps wore off, and speculative interest waned. On December 31, 1898, the sale of stamps to postmasters was discontinued. Afterward, an unknown quantity of unsold stamps were destroyed. Prior to the issuance of the $1 Western Cattle in Storm, only two other $1 US postage stamps had ever been printed and released: the $1 Columbian Exposition stamp issued in 1893 and titled Isabella Pledging Her Jewels (see :File:Columbian241-1$.jpg) and the $1 Oliver Hazard Perry (see :File:Perry 1894 Issue-1$.jpg) issued in 1894.  Appraisal  While today Western Cattle in Storm is regarded as one of the most attractive U.S. stamps ever produced, there have been detractors. John Luff, one of the most influential philatelic writers of his day, apparently did not think much of the stamp or others in the series, according to Chicago Stamps. \\"The stamps are poorly conceived and executed, overloaded with ornaments, heavy in color and blurred in printing,\\" he wrote in 1902. But by 1933, author Ralph Kimble described the Trans-Mississippi stamps as \\"perhaps the most attractive set of commemoratives which we have ever had,\\" adding additional flattery for the $1 stamp. In 1934, Stamps magazine asked readers to vote on the most beautiful stamp in the world. The Canadian 1928 50¬¢ Bluenose stamp won first place with Western Cattle in Storm placing second. Today, pristine copies of Western Cattle in Storm can sell for tens of thousands of dollars.  Reissue  In 1998, the nine stamps of the Trans-Mississippi Issue were all reissued on a souvenir sheet by the U.S. Postal Service, along with a separate souvenir sheet containing nine copies of \\"Western Cattle in Storm.\\" Unlike in 1898, the 1998 versions were issued in two colors.

Phil (Oxon) is Professor of Medieval Thought and Director, Centre for Studies in Religion and Theology, Monash University, Melbourne. He is an authority on medieval religious thought, especially on the medieval philosopher and theologian, Peter Abelard, and on interfaith dialogue. He discovered and published what are possibly the original letters exchanged between Peter Abelard and his lover, Heloise.Monash University, Faculty, Constant Mews. Early life Mews was born in England and spent his childhood there and in New Zealand. He completed his secondary education at St Peter's College, Auckland, New Zealand. He won the Trenwith Cup for History, the Taylor Cup for languages, the Arthur Bolland Cup for English and was the Dux of the college in his final year at St Peter's College in 1971. His brother is Douglas Mews. Academic career Mews attended the University of Auckland and completed BA and MA degrees there in History. He carried out doctoral study at the University of Oxford, followed by five years (1980‚Äì1985) teaching British civilisation at the Universite de Paris III, while pursuing studies in medieval thought (focusing on Peter Abelard) in connection with Jean Jolivet, at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes en sciences religieuses. This was followed by two years as a Leverhulme research fellow at the University of Sheffield on editing the writings of Peter Abelard. Mews took up a position at Monash University as Lecturer in the Department of History in July 1987. He became involved in developing the Centre for Studies in Religion and Theology and in promoting studies in religion more generally, with a strong interest in interfaith work. He has had spells of study at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, in 1990 and 2000, and has also again taught in Paris, at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes (Ve section) and in the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales. Letters of Abelard and Heloise In 1999 Mews published The Lost Love Letters of Heloise and Abelard. This contains about 113 medieval love letters, edited in 1974 by the German scholar Ewald Koensgen. The letters, ascribed simply to a man and woman, survived because a 15th-century monk copied them for an anthology. Having spent some 20 years studying Abelard's philosophical and theological writings, Mews concluded that the letters (the longest known correspondence between a man and a woman from the medieval period) were written by Abelard and Heloise.The Lost Love Letters of Heloise and Abelard In 2005 the historian Sylvain Piron translated the correspondence into French. Whether the letters were indeed the actual correspondence became a matter of intense scholarly debate in France. Mews and other scholars who support the authenticity case say all the evidence in and around the text points to Abelard and Heloise. Opponents say that is too simple and want definitive proof. They reject accusations of tunnel vision and deny they are motivated by professional envy at not having got there first. \\"It's not jealousy, it's a question of method,\\" said Monique Goullet, director of research in medieval Latin at Paris's Sorbonne University. \\"If we had proof that it was Abelard and Heloise then everyone would calm down. But the current position among literature scholars is that we are shocked by too rapid an attribution process.\\" But after his years of research, Mews is all the more convinced. \\"The first time I encountered the words and ideas they sent a shiver down my spine. Unfortunately, that has been attacked as evidence of an emotional response,\\" he said. \\"There has been some very quick stereotyping of other people's arguments.\\" Most Latin experts agree the document is authentic and of great literary worth, but its uniqueness makes some scholars suspicious. \\"The most probable explanation is that it is a literary work written by one person who decided to reconstitute the writings of Abelard and Heloise,\\" Goullet said. Others say it was a stylistic exercise between two students who imagined themselves as the lovers, or that it was written by another couple.Jane Sullivan, \\"Scholars turn medieval letters into a lovers' tiff\\", The Age, 5 March 2005 Mews has since discovered further textual parallels between the letters and the writings of Abelard which further support his arguments, included in Abelard and Heloise, Great Medieval ThinkersAbelard and Heloise and journal articles published in 2007Cicero and the Boundaries of Friendship in the Twelfth Century and 2009.Discussing Love: The Epistolae duorum amantium and Abelard‚Äôs Sic et Non Selected works * \\"Abelard and his Legacy\\", Variorum Reprints, London, Ashgate, 2001. * \\"Reason and Belief in the Age of Roscelin and Abelard\\", Variorum Reprints, London, Ashgate, 2002. * \\"The Lost Love Letters of Heloise and Abelard: Perceptions of Dialogue in Twelfth- Century France\\", Palgrave MacMillan, New York, 1999; 2nd edition, 2008. * \\"Abelard and Heloise\\", New York, Oxford University Press, 2005. * \\"Cicero and the Boundaries of Friendship in the Twelfth Century\\", Viator 38/2 (2007), 369‚Äì384. * \\"Discussing Love: The Epistolae duorum amantium and Abelard's Sic et Non\\", Journal of Medieval Latin 19 (2009), 130‚Äì47.

Among recent developments is the theory of open source governance which advocates the application of the philosophies of the free software movement to democratic principles to enable interested citizens to get more directly involved in the legislative process. History Since 2007 a variety of bloggers and writers, including Mark Surman,Surman, M., \\"Open, Philanthropy and a theory of change,\\" commonspace, 2008 http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/open-philanthropy-and-a- theory-of-change/ have proposed the concept of \\"Open Philanthropy\\". Few of these early efforts seemed to get much traction with stakeholders or nonprofit leaders. Then early in 2010, Lucy BernholzBernholz, L., \\"Open Philanthropy: A Modest Manifesto,\\" California Voices, 2010, http://california.newamerica.net/blogposts/2010/open_philanthropy_a_modest_manifesto-29189 again surfaced the concept for how nonprofits should follow the conventions of open source and open government initiatives.

The majority of funds spent are in support of programs and services. Administrative and fundraising costs are kept within reasonable limits with a goal of more than 75 percent of funds allocated to program and outreach expenses. =Program efficiency= Organizations shall have a documented methodology to measure and accurately report programmatic achievements, and where appropriate, the actual cost per beneficiary for program services. Additionally, these efforts shall account, and if necessary discount, for program achievements that are accomplished through and with other organizations. Program costs shall be managed to be as reasonable as possible, without sacrificing services, quality, and long-term sustainability of services. =Organizational effectiveness= Programming is designed to be both sustainable and scalable using models other organizations can emulate and adopt or proving new concepts. Fundraising efforts match anticipated programming needs. Program efforts demonstrate high numbers of beneficiaries served with programs, which are sustainable for years and decades. Post-program monitoring and research designed to test impact, value, sustainability, and scalability of solutions. Measures of success are meaningful, accurate, and complete. =Governance, controls and compliance= Organization has documented strategic, fiscal, and annual plans and processes that are shared with appropriate stakeholders. Ongoing management review of key deliverables with risks identified and dis-aggregated by type. Mitigation strategies and processes incorporate controls, accountabilities, monitoring, and reporting. There shall be a clear organizational tone regarding ethical behavior in all the activities of the organization. Proactively explain actions and material decisions to stakeholders, including government, donors, beneficiaries, and the public at large. =Shared lessons and content= As the organization develops, implements, tests, and then refines procedures and processes, it shares those lessons in a non-competitive fashion with other organizations that might benefit from past successes. In regard to content, the organization will strive to collect, process, and share media assets such as video, still imagery, and audio in a manner that allows for release under creative commons, no commercial use, with attribution licensing terms. Where permissible and valuable, make data interoperable and release intellectual property under open source creative commons licensing terms. =Reporting and transparency= Organizations shall publish and make conveniently available important data about the organization, its staffing, resources, and governance. Reporting shall be in a format convenient for stakeholders and can include printed and digital reports, audio programming or real-time online systems. All reports shall be published on a timely basis and in particular financial data, including filed tax returns, shall be publicly available within 30 days of necessary audits. Organizations shall use best efforts to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of information released and shall promptly correct inaccuracies or incorrect materials. =Practical limitations= Within the scope of open philanthropy there are practical limitations to the extent all materials shall be open and visible by the public. Materials whose release would be prohibited by law, or that may compromise the corporate or personal safety of others are exempt. Those items with contractual privacy or licensing arrangements do not require disclosure. Organizations shall not disclose information that compromises the integrity of others, and/or organizational processes and policies. Only to the extent as explicitly permitted, donor information shall be exempt. In compliance with trademark law, trade names and marks are exempt from reuse without attribution.

As a nation living within the United States of America, the Native American people face conflicting opinions within their tribes, essentially those living on federally approved reservations. Interactions with the federal government and the overall American culture surrounding them influence day-to-day tribal life. Native American culture as a whole rests between the divide of the traditionalists and those who wish to trade the old ways for improved conditions. Poverty and culture 1940 government photo of Chippewa baby teething on a magazine titled Indians at work \\"Approximately 14 percent of all American Indians in 1980 lived on large reservations with reservation poverty of 40 percent or higher.\\"Sandefur, Gary D. American Indian reservations: The first underclass areas? Despite the conditions, Natives continue to live on the reservations because they see it as a cultural center for their particular tribe, value the implied sense of community, and receive government-funded benefits that they wouldn't gain otherwise. As a cultural center, the reservations serve as a holding place for the old ways of Native American customs. \\"In the southeastern or Woodland tradition, those old ways are most often connected to myths, stories, music, and dance.\\"Gregory , H.F. \\"Pete\\". The Stories of the Old People. http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Art icles_Essays/creole_art_stories_old_peo.html There are some unwilling to share the \\"old ways\\" with outsiders because they feel it is sacred knowledge not easily given away to someone not of Native lineage. Organizations such as Native American Community Development Institute have been created \\"as an alliance of the major Indian nonprofits and several Indian businesses in the metropolitan area committed to community-building through sector economic development and large-scale development\\".Native American Community Development Institute. http://www.nacdi.org/default/index . cfm/about-us/background/ They are devoted to the increase in economic innovation, and accomplish their mission by focusing on the growing number of Native youths and not placing a priority on traditional ways. Native Americans suffer not only the highest poverty rates of all ethnic groups in America, but also the highest unemployment and disease rates.Carlson, Peter. In the year of 'Dances with Wolves,' everybody wanted to be on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. Nearly a decade later, it can hardly get a quorum The Washington Post. February 23, 1997. Drug and alcohol abuse is common among the youth as well as teenage pregnancy and suicide. =Alcohol in reservation life= In a 2008 study by the Prevention Research Center, \\"Native American youth were more likely to have consumed alcohol in their lifetime and been intoxicated in the [time period of the test] than Whites. Native American drinkers were almost twice as likely to have gotten alcohol from an adult and twice as likely to have obtained alcohol from someone under 21.\\"Friese, Bettina, Ph.D., Grube, Joel, Ph.D. Differences In Drinking Behavior And Access To Alcohol Between Native American and White Adolescents. Journal of Drug Education, 38(3):273-284, 2008 From 1994 to 1996, the alcoholism death rate among Natives was seven times that of the nation. \\"Lifetime prevalence of alcohol dependence was high among all tribes (men: 21‚Äì56%, women: 17‚Äì30%), but one (men: 1%, women: 2%).\\"Dightman, Douglas MPH, Goldman, David MD, Koss Mary P. PhD, Polacca, Mona MSW, Prince, Ronald J. MS, Sanderson, Byron MSW, Yuan, Nicole P. PhD. Adverse Childhood Exposures and Alcohol Dependence Among Seven Native American Tribes. Print Healthcare: improvements vs. shortcomings One aspect of reservation life that discourages tribal members is healthcare, a service provided by the United States government for approximately 800,000 Natives. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Native Americans receive lower quality healthcare than other minorities such as Hispanics. With the addition of the HR3200 healthcare bill comes the promise of better services provided for the Native people. There will be an approximate 13% increase in funding for the Indian Health Service. Dr. Roubideaux, the head of the HIS, praises this addition saying, \\"There is not a Native American alive today who has not witnessed the many shortcomings of the Indian Health Service\\", but as Dr. Roubideaux has said, \\"most of the failures were due to an extreme shortage of funds.\\"Giago, Tim. How Will Universal healthcare affect Native Americans? (2009) http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-giago/how-will-universal- health_b_218636.html Cultural barriers According to Elaine Watson Jordan, Ph.D., the Native American education system is severely flawed with respect to cultural barriers. In Breaking Barriers, Jordan notes that \\"it is important to describe the complexities of culture and language to illuminate how limited standardized practices and measures might be to summarize the skills of many children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds\\".Jordan, Elaine Watson Ph.D. Breaking the Barriers: Educational Empowerment in an Era of Standardization. (2007) She states that total \\"indoctrination to a new culture\\" is not the answer to a healthy education. Jordan argues that barriers must be identified to be overcome and uses the compulsory attendance law of 1898 as an example of overlooking cultural boundaries. \\"Guided by the belief that American Indians should be assimilated into mainstream society\\", Congress put into effect this law which would give the federal government the power to place American Indian children in boarding schools, \\"by force\\" if necessary. =Family values= In March 1974, the Department of Labor issued the results of their research concerning Native youth integrating American culture into their lives after leaving the reservation for educational and occupational pursuits.Belding, Nancye, Miles, H. Guy, Sparks, L. Tamara. Perspective of Adjustment: Rural Navajo and Papago Youth. (1974) Print. Research was done to determine the \\"occupational adjustment\\" of American Indian youth coming from reservations and seeking education away from home. The study found that \\"the family is perhaps the most important aspect of the traditional Indian's life\\". Cultural values of Native American individuals are described as, \\"The traditional Indian's view of the world and his own place in it is one of living in harmony with nature\\". In also studying the parents of the children observed, \\"they distrust the white man as one who wants to destroy their culture, and are likely to see the problems of the Indians as having been created by the white man\\". In response to this research, a counselor for a youth organization said, \\"We want to be assured that we are not misused at all, but that the project will be used in a good way for the benefit of our people\\". Natives did not welcome the research because \\"there is very little history of community involvement\\" and trying to get Native youths who were taught early to be community-oriented is a difficult process in this aspect. =Educational interests= In June 2004, 90% of high school age natives attended public school, although the dropout rate was the highest of any minority. Beyond the fourth grade, academic performance drops quickly. A survey of schools indicates the reasoning behind the dropouts: * Student- teacher relationships (teachers do not care about me ‚Äì 37%; teachers do not provide enough assistance ‚Äì 39%; disagreements with teacher ‚Äì 33%) * Content of schooling (school is not important to what I want to do in life ‚Äì 44%; school is not important to me as a Native American ‚Äì 24%) * Lack of parental support (problems at home ‚Äì 44%; lack of parental encouragement ‚Äì 39%)Alanis, Luisa and Tsai, Grace.\\"Journey to Thinking Multiculturally.\\" NASP Communiqu√©, Vol. 32, #8.\\" June 2004 Despite the dropout rate, some Native students have elected to go to college of their own accord, though the transition is difficult in regards to financing and receiving support from home. \\"Hispanics and Native Americans trail substantially behind blacks in terms of college enrollment, retention, and graduation despite the fact that they, like blacks, may benefit from Affirmative Action.\\" A National Educational Longitudinal Survey revealed that in the late 1990s, the United States Education system served 1.4% of Natives. Also, Native Americans are the second most disadvantaged minority group in the nation when it comes to transitioning from single parent households to a continued education.Charles, Camille Z, Roscigno, Vincent J, and Torres, Kimberly C. Racial inequality and college attendance: The mediating role of parental investments. (2006) In her book Living Through the Generations: Continuity and Change in Navajo Women's Lives, Joanna McCloskey addresses a growing desire to receive a further education among her Native youth. \\"Younger generations recognize the necessity of further training and education to compete in the labor force, and high school graduation remains symbolic of the vast gulf between the elders who never attended school.\\"McCloskey, Joanne. Living Through the Generations: Continuity and Change in Navajo Women's Lives. (2007) Print. =Achievement gap regarding language= To evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction. For example, the Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation & Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.Kituwah Preservation & Education Program Powerpoint, by Renissa Walker (2012)'. 2012. Print. There is also a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade. Because Oklahoma's official language is English, Cherokee immersion students are hindered when taking state-mandated tests because they have little competence in English. The Department of Education of Oklahoma said that in 2012 state tests: 11% of the school's sixth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 25% showed proficiency in reading; 31% of the seventh-graders showed proficiency in math, and 87% showed proficiency in reading; 50% of the eighth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 78% showed proficiency in reading. The Oklahoma Department of Education listed the charter school as a Targeted Intervention school, meaning the school was identified as a low- performing school but has not so that it was a Priority School. Ultimately, the school made a C, or a 2.33 grade point average on the state's A-F report card system. The report card shows the school getting an F in mathematics achievement and mathematics growth, a C in social studies achievement, a D in reading achievement, and an A in reading growth and student attendance. \\"The C we made is tremendous,\\" said school principal Holly Davis, \\"[t]here is no English instruction in our school's younger grades, and we gave them this test in English.\\" She said she had anticipated the low grade because it was the school's first year as a state-funded charter school, and many students had difficulty with English. Eighth graders who graduate from the Tahlequah immersion school are fluent speakers of the language, and they usually go on to attend Sequoyah High School where classes are taught in both English and Cherokee. Changing gender roles \\"The Great Law of Peace included a section akin to the U.S. Bill of Rights, protecting the freedom of worship, speech, and assembly. The Cherokees limited town size so that all citizens could have the opportunity to speak in each council session if they so desired. Both republics were gender-blind, allowing women and men the same opportunities to participate and, if elected, to lead.\\"Sturgis, Amy H.Liberty in Perfection: Freedom in Native American Thought. (1999) As late as 1989, some Native women retained the belief that raising families was their duty. One woman, Cindy Negale describes, \\"I prefer the traditional life because I was brought up very traditional by my grandparents...I am telling [my children] that Navajo is important.\\" Also, she reveals that having large families is discouraged by the Indian Health Service because there is not enough healthcare money available for them. This opposes the Native standard that \\"prenatal values, integral to matrilineal clan membership, were expressed in pride in children\\". As well, other Native women have chosen to decrease the size of their families. The grandmothers would choose a path of natural fertility and give birth until they no longer could. In the present day, most mothers decided to limit their families to three to four children. \\"No longer sources of labor, the children become investments during long years of growth and education.\\" Self- government AIM flag \\"The Iroquois and the Cherokees did not value the process of a democratic republic because it consumed their identity; they valued it because it protected their individuality. The political debate from the Cherokee town council to the Iroquois Grand Council limited by law what the group could do to the person.\\" The Natives place a high importance on individuality in government and thus, the issues dividing them will be resolved using a democratic-like resolution. Through the self-determination policy proposed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, tribal governments have the right to control federal programs directed at the Native Americans. Instead of supervising the tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs \\"began to serve\\".Fouberg, Erin Hogan. Tribal Territory, Sovereignty, and Governance: A Study of the Cheyenne River and Lake Traverse Indian Reservations. (2000) Print. Congress then passed legislation recognizing the tribal judicial system and the decisions made through it. Groups such as the American Indian Movement (AIM) support this movement because it allows them to act independent of the United States government while still securing their voting rights.

At the time approximately 2000 Chinese and 700 European migrants were living in the Buckland area. Riot Anti-Chinese sentiment was widespread during the Victorian gold rush. This resentment manifested on 4 July 1857 when around 100 European rioters attacked Chinese settlements. The rioters had just left a public meeting at the Buckland Hotel where the riot ringleaders decided they would attempt to expel all the Chinese in the Buckland Valley. Contemporaneous newspaper reports claim that the riot was \\"led by Americans 'inflamed by liquor'\\". During the riot Chinese miners were beaten and robbed then driven across the Buckland River. At least three Chinese miners died reportedly of ill-health and entire encampments and a recently constructed Joss house were destroyed. Police arrested thirteen European accused rioters, however the empaneled juries acquitted all of major offences \\"amid the cheers of bystanders\\". The verdicts of the juries were later criticized in the press. One of the police involved in the arrests was Robert O'Hara Burke, later of the infamous Burke and Wills expedition. Aftermath The Chinese miners were invited to return to the Buckland Valley, however only fifty did so. The Buckland Riot has been compared to the Eureka Stockade uprising in size and intensity, but is not remembered such.

English), anapirophobia, anapirism, and disability discrimination) is discrimination and social prejudice against people with disabilities or who are perceived to have disabilities. Ableism characterizes persons as defined by their disabilities and as inferior to the non- disabled.Linton, Simi (1998). Claiming Disability Knowledge and Identity. New York: New York University Press. p. 9. On this basis, people are assigned or denied certain perceived abilities, skills, or character orientations. There are stereotypes, generally inaccurate, associated with either disability in general, or with specific disabilities (for instance a presumption that all disabled people want to be cured, that wheelchair users necessarily have an intellectual disability or that blind people have some special form of insight). These stereotypes, in turn, serve as a justification for ableist practices and reinforce discriminatory attitudes and behaviors toward people who are disabled.W√ºllenweber, Ernst; Theunissen, Georg; M√ºhl, Heinz (2006). P√§dagogik bei geistigen Behinderungen: ein Handbuch f√ºr Studium und Praxis (Education for intellectual disabilities: A manual for study and practice) (in German). Kohlhammer Verlag. p. 149. .

Heilpaedagogik-info.de. Retrieved 2014-05-12. In ableist societies, people with disabilities are viewed as less valuable, or even seen as expendable. The eugenics movement of the early 20th century would be considered an example of widespread ableism. Ableism can also be better understood by reading literature published by those who experience disability and ableism first- hand. Disability Studies is an academic discipline that is also beneficial to explore to gain a better understanding of ableism. Etymology Originated from -able (in disable, disabled) and -ism (in racism, sexism); first known use in 1985‚Äì1990.  History  = Canada = Ableism in Canada refers to a set of discourses, behaviors, and structures that express feelings of anxiety, fear, hostility, and antipathy towards people with disabilities in Canada. The specific types of discrimination that have occurred or are still occurring in Canada include the inability to access important facilities such as infrastructure within the transport network, restrictive immigration policies, involuntary sterilization to stop people with disabilities from having offspring, barriers to employment opportunities, wages that are insufficient to maintain a minimal standard of living, and institutionalization of people with disabilities in substandard conditions. Austerity measures implemented by the government of Canada have also at times been referred to as ableist, such as funding cuts that put people with disabilities at risk of living in abusive arrangements. = Nazi Germany = In 1939 Hitler signed the secret euthanasia program decree, Aktion T4, which authorized the killing of selected patients diagnosed with chronic neurological and psychiatric disorders. This program killed about 70,000 people with disabilities before it was officially halted by Hitler in 1941 under public pressure, and it was unofficially continued out of the public eye, killing a total of 200,000 or more by the end of Hitler's reign in 1945. =United Kingdom= A poster of the British suffrage movement, attacking the fact that women were placed next to \\"lunatics\\" and convicts in being unable to vote. Ableist and eugenicist ideas were often found in suffrage rhetoric. In the UK, disability discrimination became unlawful as a result of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, and the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. These were later superseded, retaining the substantive law, by the Equality Act 2010. The Equality Act 2010 brought together protections against multiple areas of discriminatory behavior (disability, race, religion and belief, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age and pregnancy the so-called 'protected characteristics'). Under EA2010 there are prohibitions addressing several forms of discrimination: direct discrimination (s.13(1) Equality Act 2010), indirect discrimination (s.6 and s.19 Equality Act 2010, harassment (s.26 Equality Act 2010), victimisation (s.27(2) Equality Act 2010), discrimination arising from disability (s.15(1) Equality Act 2010 and failure to make reasonable adjustments (s.20 Equality Act 2010). Part 2, Chapter 1, Section 6, of the Equality Act 2010 states that: ‚ÄúA person P has a disability if (a) P has a physical or mental impairment, and (b) the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on P's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.‚Äú (Please note that as with any English, for the purposes of the interpretation of the Equality Act 2010, and, for the purposes of righteousness, both phonetically and otherwise derived undertones apparently implied by the nomenclature and numbering manifest in the phrase ‚ÄúPart 2, Chapter 1, Section 6‚Äù as well as in the abbreviated ‚ÄúP‚Äù which takes the place of ‚Äúperson‚Äù in the document, are irrelevant.) =United States= Before the 1800s, the perspective of disability was often from a religious point of view. Individuals with disability were seen as evil or possessed by the devil. Much like many minority groups, disabled Americans were often segregated and denied certain rights for a majority of American history. In the 1800s, a shift from a religious view to a more scientific view took place and caused more individuals with disabilities to be examined. Public stigma began to change after World War II when many Americans returned home with disabilities and physical handicaps. In the 1960s, following the civil rights movement in America, the world began the disabled rights movement. The movement was intended to give all individuals with disabilities equal rights and opportunities. Until the 1970s, ableism in the United States was often codified into law. For example, in many jurisdictions, so-called \\"ugly laws\\" barred people from appearing in public if they had diseases or disfigurements that were considered unsightly.  Rehabilitation Act of 1973  Section 504 and other sections of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 enacted into law certain civil penalties for failing to make public places comply with access codes known as the ADA Access Guidelines (ADAAG). These laws prohibit direct discrimination against disabled people in government programs, employment, public transit, and public accommodations like stores and restaurants.  Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984 The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act was passed to promote the fundamental right to vote by improving access for handicapped and elderly individuals to registration facilities and polling places for Federal elections by requiring access to polling places used in Federal elections and available registration and voting aids, such as instructions in large type  Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988  The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of mental or physical disability and requires that newly constructed multi-family housing meet certain access guidelines while requiring landlords to allow disabled persons to modify existing dwellings for accessibility. The law also protects people with mental disabilities by prohibiting discrimination in housing and allowing people with mental illness or any other disability to live where they choose.  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) was passed on July 26, 1990, during the George H. W. Bush administration and amended on January 1, 2009. The act gave individuals with disabilities civil rights protections.  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a four-part (A-D) piece of American legislation that ensures students with a disability are provided with Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) that is tailored to their individual needs. IDEA was previously known as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) from 1975 to 1990. In 1990, the United States Congress reauthorized EHA and changed the title to IDEA (Public Law No. 94-142). Overall, the goal of IDEA is to provide children with disabilities the same opportunity for education as those students who do not have a disability.  Workplace  In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act was put in place to prohibit private employers, state and local government, employment agencies and labor unions from discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in job applications, when hiring, firing, advancement in workplace, compensation, training, and on other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, also known as the EEOC also plays a part in fighting against ableism by being responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. Despite legislation to reduce disability discrimination, roughly 13.3 million Americans with disabilities report difficulty finding a job.  Healthcare  In England, Scotland and Wales it is permitted for an abortion to be performed on the basis of the foetus having physical or mental abnormalities.  Schools  Ableism often makes the world unwelcoming, and inaccessible to people with disabilities - especially in schools. An ableist would assert that children with disabilities need to assimilate to the normative culture. For example, a student who experiences a disability needs to read text instead of listening to a tape recording of the text. In the past, schools have focused too much on fixing the disability, but due to progressive reforms, schools are now focused on minimizing the impact of a student‚Äôs disability, and giving support, skills, and more opportunities to live a full life. Moreover, schools are required to maximize access to their entire community. In 2004, Congress made into law the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which states that free and appropriate education is eligible to children with disabilities with insurance of necessary services. Congress later amended the law, in 2015, to include the Every Student Succeeds Act, which guarantees equal opportunity for people with disabilities full participation in society, and the tools for overall independent success.  Media  Disabilities are not only misrepresented in the media but often underrepresented as well. These common ways of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities. While roughly 20 percent of the population is disabled, only 2 percent of characters played in television and film have a disability. 95 percent of the time, disabled characters are played by actors and actresses who are not disabled. = Disabled villain = One common form of media depiction of disability is to portray villains with a mental or physical disability. Lindsey Row-Heyveld notes, for instance, \\"that villainous pirates are scraggly, wizened, and inevitably kitted out with a peg leg, eye patch, or hook hand whereas heroic pirates look like Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.\\" The disability of the villain is meant to separate them from the average viewer and dehumanize the antagonist. As a result, stigma forms surrounding the disability and the individuals that live with it. = Inspiration porn = Inspiration porn is the use of people with disabilities performing ordinary tasks as a form of inspiration.Young, Stella. \\"Stella Young: I'm not your inspiration, thank you very much  TED Talk\\". TED.com. Retrieved 2015-08-19. Criticisms of inspiration porn say that it distances people with disabilities from individuals who are not disabled and portrays disability as an obstacle to overcome or rehab.Mitchell, Kate (17 July 2017). \\"On Inspiration Porn\\". Huffington Post. Retrieved 5 March 2018. = Pitied character = In many forms of media such as films and articles a person who experiences disability is portrayed as a character who is viewed as less than able, different, and an \\"outcast.\\" Hayes & Black (2003) explore Hollywood films as the discourse of pity towards disability as a problem of social, physical, and emotional confinement. The aspect of pity is heightened through the storylines of media focusing on the individual's weaknesses as opposed to strengths and therefore leaving audiences a negative and ableist portrayal towards disability. = Supercrip stereotype = The supercrip narrative is generally a story of a person with an apparent disability who is able to \\"overcome\\" their physical differences and somehow accomplish an impressive task. In Thomas Hehir's \\"Eliminating Ableism in Education,\\" he uses the example of a blind man who climbs Mount Everest as an example of the supercrip narrative. The Paralympics are another example of the supercrip stereotype, since they generate a large amount of media attention, and demonstrate disabled people doing extremely strenuous physical tasks. Although at face value, this may appear inspiring, Hehir explains that many people with disabilities can view these news stories as setting unrealistic expectations. Additionally, Hehir mentions that supercrip stories imply that disabled people are required to overcome their disabilities by performing these impressive tasks to be seen as an equal and avoid pity from those without disabilities.  Sports  A runner in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games Sports are often an area of society in which ableism is evident. In sports media, athletes with disabilities are often portrayed to be inferior. When athletes with disabilities are discussed in the media, there is often an emphasis on rehabilitation and the road to recovery, which is inherently a negative view on the disability. Oscar Pistorius is a South African runner who competed in the 2004, 2008, and 2012 Paralympics and the 2012 Olympic games in London. Pistorius was the first double amputee athlete to compete in the Olympic games.Robert Klemko (10 August 2012), \\"Oscar Pistorius makes history, leaves without medal\\", USA Today, archived from the original on 11 August 2012. While media coverage focused on inspiration and competition during his time in the Paralympic games, it shifted to questioning whether his prosthetic legs gave him an advantage while competing in the Olympic games.

The singer included a trio of musical numbers from Man of La Mancha in this set as well as songs from Funny Girl, Kismet, and On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, shows that he had recognized on previous releases. Mathis also covers recent imports from France (\\"I Will Wait for You\\", \\"What Now My Love\\") and Brazil (\\"So Nice (Samba de Verao)\\") and offers a rendition of a 1944 hit record (\\"I Dream of You\\") as part of the mix. The title track from the album had its first appearance on Billboard magazine's list of the 40 most popular Easy Listening songs in the US in the issue dated September 10, 1966, and stayed there for seven weeks, during which time it peaked at number 17.. The album So Nice debuted on the magazine's Top LP's chart in the issue dated October 8 of that year and made it to number 50 over the course of 18 weeks.. The So Nice LP was released for the first time on compact disc on December 4, 2012, as one of two albums on one CD, the second of the two being its 1967 follow-up, Johnny Mathis Sings. Both were also included in Sony's Mathis box set The Complete Global Albums Collection, which was released on November 17, 2014. History The bulk of the arranging and conducting chores on this project were handled by Glenn Osser, and the inclusion of a song co-written by his wife Edna brought back memories of the couple for Mathis. \\"'She used to come to the sessions, and I was very fond of her. He and his wife were just the nicest people.'\\"(2012) So Nice/Johnny Mathis Sings by Johnny Mathis [CD booklet]. New York: Sony Music Entertainment RGM-0108. The singer also recalls his introduction to her composition \\"I Dream of You\\". \\"'I first heard it when I heard Johnny Nash sing it on his first album. And of course Glenn arranged it on my album. You know, I can always tell who arranged things by the horn section. On \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\" I can definitely hear Glenn Osser.'\\" Mathis was exposed to the Man of La Mancha selections before they made it to Broadway. \\"'I went to the Village and saw Richard Kiley‚Ä¶It was the first time I had seen him‚Ä¶and he was brilliant. I always loved his voice‚Ä¶That's how I came to record the songs.'\\" That early exposure led to live performances of some of the numbers from the show that he did sooner than most of his colleagues. \\"'I remember doing those songs while the show was still running, and I think I was one of the first ones to do some of the songs live in a nightclub act.'\\" And he continued performing them long afterward. \\"'For many years I did a medley in concert. A high point was in London‚Ä¶I did it there, and it was the best version I ever did. I always remember it.'\\" Reception Allmusic's Joe Viglione was effusive in his praise, \\"The singer works with authority -- his pitch always perfect and his focus never missing the mark.\\" He singles out a few tracks in particular. \\"Mathis can always pull a 'The Music That Makes Me Dance' out of his hat to give his huge and faithful audience the style and sound he is best known for, with Glenn Osser's conducting and arrangement simply sublime. The dozen songs on So Nice range from pop to standards with touches of jazz, with an exquisitely quiet 'I Dream of You' uncovering the singer's uncanny ability to blend his tone with an air of mystery. Even a lesser song like 'Baubles, Bangles and Beads' comes off with a touch of majesty; it's not easy to do, but Mathis pulls it off effortlessly.\\" Track listing =Side one= #\\"The Impossible Dream (The Quest)\\" from Man of La Mancha (Joe Darion, Mitch Leigh) ‚Äì 3:44 #\\"I Will Wait for You\\" from The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (Jacques Demy, Norman Gimbel, Michel LeGrand) ‚Äì 3:01 #\\"What the World Needs Now Is Love\\" (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) ‚Äì 2:37 #\\"Hurry!

He was the second Judge Advocate General for the Canadian Forces and the first Chief Electoral Officer of Canada. He also served as the first Canadian co-chair of the Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defense. Biggar was well known as a leading Canadian lawyer with expertise in public law and patent law. Early life and education Biggar was born in Toronto, Ontario. He was the eldest son of lawyer Charles Robert Webster Biggar and Jane Helen Mowat (daughter of Sir Oliver Mowat, a former Premier of Ontario).Biggar Family Lineage Biggar was educated at Upper Canada College, graduating in 1894. He attended University College at the University of Toronto and graduated with a B.A. in 1898. In 1901 Biggar graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School and began practicing as a lawyer with Biggar & Burton. By 1903, he moved to Edmonton, Alberta, and was called to the bar there. On April 30, 1908 he married Muriel Elizabeth Whitney (daughter of J.G. Whitney). Together they had one daughter, Sally Vernon Biggar.Who's Who Canada, 1943. O.M. Biggar, c. 1917-1918 Early career and military involvement While in Edmonton, Biggar made a reputation for himself as a capable lawyer. He practiced with Short, Cross and Biggar from 1903 to 1915, and was made King's Counsel in 1913. He was appointed in 1911 to the Board of Governors of the University of Alberta, on which he served until 1914. He also served on the Board of Edmonton Hospital during this period. From 1915-1920, he was counsel for Woods, Sherry, Collison & Field in Edmonton. When World War I broke out, Biggar enlisted with the 101st Regiment, \\"Edmonton Fusiliers\\". From 1916 to 1917, he served as the Assistant Judge Advocate General for Military District 13 in Calgary, following which he served on the Military Service Council. He soon rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and was appointed Judge Advocate General of Canada in 1918. The following year, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. Delegate to Paris 1919 peace conference At the conclusion of World War I, Sir Robert Borden, then Canada's Prime Minister, invited Biggar to attend the peace conferences in Paris and Versailles as chief legal adviser and member of the Canadian delegation. Biggar was also asked to serve as British Secretary of the War Guilt Commission and Assistant Secretary of the British delegation.Library and Archives Canada Civil service roles Upon his return to Canada, Biggar continued to serve in various senior civil service roles. He was named vice chairman of the Air Board serving under Arthur Sifton, where he organized Canada's Air Department to govern the fledgling aeronautics industry. This was subsequently divided into its civilian (Canadian Air Transport Board) and military (Royal Canadian Air Force) components. Biggar served on the Air Board from 1919 to 1922. Biggar was also retained as counsel to the Department of Justice to represent the Canadian government on a number of cases, including a case before the Supreme Court of Canada regarding the jurisdiction of the Board of Commerce under the War Measures Act.Price Brothers & Co v Canada (Board of Commerce) (1920), 60 SCR 265. =Chief Electoral Officer= In 1920, the House of Commons of Canada unanimously voted for Biggar as Canada's first Chief Electoral Officer following the enactment of the Dominion Elections Act. During his tenure, he increased the accuracy and completeness of the voter rolls, in particular by adding women, who had been allowed to vote in federal elections for the first time in 1921 but had often been prevented from voting by inaccurate voter rolls. Biggar also recommended to Parliament that advance polling be made more widely available, a suggestion that Parliament took up. =League of Nations= Biggar was a staunch supporter of the League of Nations and advocated for Canada's role in it. As a former advisor to Prime Minister Borden and a delegate to the 1919 Paris peace conference where the League was founded, Biggar often consulted government officials and politicians on matters of international law. He served as chairman of the Canadian Bar Association committee on international law and was also the chairman of the Canadian League of Nations Society executive committee. In 1924, Biggar was asked by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to advise the Department of External Affairs on Canada's role in the League of Nations. This role was later taken over by Oscar D. Skelton. =National Resources Acts= From 1925 to 1926, Biggar was also involved as a negotiator in the drafting of the Natural Resources Acts, which transferred control over crown lands and natural resources from the federal government to the provincial governments. He was appointed by the Department of the Interior to represent the federal government's position in negotiations with Alberta.Tough, Frank J. \\"The Forgotten Constitution: The Natural Resources Transfer Agreements and Indian Livelihood Rights, ca. 1925-1933\\" (2004) 41:4 Alta L Rev 999 at 1019. Biggar played a role in limiting provincial jurisdiction over aboriginal communities, arguing in favour of protection of aboriginal rights including hunting and fishing rights on crown lands within provincial territory.Tough at 1022. Return to private practice with Smart & Biggar In 1927, Biggar was invited by Russel S. Smart, the Ottawa managing partner of the intellectual property law firm then known as Fetherstonhaugh & Smart, to join his growing litigation practice as a partner. Biggar accepted the offer and resigned from his post as Chief Electoral Officer. Together, the two men formed the firm Smart & Biggar. The same year, he published a treatise comparing Canadian, British, and American patent law. During his time in private practice, Biggar appeared on behalf of a large variety of companies in numerous intellectual property cases. He also continued practice in public and constitutional law, including acting as counsel for the Province of Alberta in Reference Re Alberta Statutes,[1938] SCR 100 (CanLII). a landmark Supreme Court of Canada decision on the jurisdiction of Alberta to enact the Social Credit Act and the Bank Taxation Act. Biggar was also retained as counsel in 1938 and 1939 on behalf of the Senate Committee on Railways, which was tasked with the problem of the financial burden the railway system was placing on the government. Second World War Col. O.M. Biggar with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia The outbreak of World War II and Canada's participation led Biggar to return to civil service. In 1940, then Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King selected Biggar to be one of his senior advisors and appointed him to the newly created Canada-U.S. Permanent Joint Board on Defense. This Board was co-chaired by Biggar as representative of Canada and Fiorello La Guardia, the former mayor of New York as the U.S. representative. In 1942, Biggar was appointed Director of Censorship working under Minister of War Services Joseph Thorarinn Thorson. He was tasked with creating a single agency for the purpose of effective wartime censorship out of what was then five separate operations. These operations became one branch of the National War Services Department that was staffed successfully by volunteers. Biggar was also invited to be a member of the Wartime Information Board. Later life and death Biggar suffered a heart failure in the spring of 1944 and was forced to reduce his responsibilities. With his health deteriorating, Biggar relinquished his duties to General Andrew McNaughton in 1945. Biggar died in Ottawa in 1948, at the age of 71.

The Chicago Seven In the late 1970s, Nagle became a member of the Chicago Seven, a group led by Tigerman which emerged in opposition to the doctrinal application of modernism, as represented particularly in Chicago by the followers of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In 2005, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, organized a reunion of the Chicago Seven to discuss the contemporary state of Chicago architecture, Celebrating 25 Years of the Chicago Seven. As part of the panel discussion, Nagle commented on the state of affairs that prompted the intervention of the Chicago Seven: \\"It wasn't Mies that got boring. It was the copiers that got boring....

In his interview as part of the Chicago Architects Oral Histories Project, Nagle spoke of the work his office was doing at that time: \\"I remember the reaction to [one of our projects] was, Wow, these guys are changing; they're doing things that are different from what they did before; there's a new movement afoot. So we all got excited about moving on to something that was different. A lot of it really had to do with history. That's what the postmodernist movement was all about. The appreciation of history made us all much better architects. One of the things that I find from 1930s and 1940s architecture is that the people who have gone through the Beaux-Arts understand the history of architecture and for the good architects, such as Alvar Aalto and Corbusier, it probably made them better modernists because they didn‚Äôt learn through abstraction. Gropius was wrong. You should know your history and understand and be able to operate on those levels and then go on to do your own thing and presumably do something that‚Äôs original.\\"Oral History of James Lee Nagle, interviewed by Annemarie van Roessel, 2000, p. 83.

Unlike spastic or ataxic cerebral palsies, ADCP is characterized by both hypertonia and hypotonia, due to the affected individual's inability to control muscle tone. Clinical diagnosis of ADCP typically occurs within 18 months of birth and is primarily based upon motor function and neuroimaging techniques. While there are no cures for ADCP, some drug therapies as well as speech, occupational therapy, and physical therapy have shown capacity for treating the symptoms. Classification of cerebral palsy can be based on severity, topographic distribution, or motor function. Severity is typically assessed via the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (described further below). Classification based on motor characteristics classifies CP as occurring from damage to either the corticospinal pathway or extrapyramidal regions. Athetoid dyskinetic cerebral palsy is a non-spastic, extrapyramidal form of cerebral palsy (spastic cerebral palsy, in contrast, results from damage to the brain's corticospinal pathways). Non-spastic cerebral palsy is divided into two groups, ataxic and dyskinetic. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is separated further into two different groups; choreoathetoid and dystonic. Choreo-athetotic CP is characterized by involuntary movements most predominantly found in the face and extremities. Dystonic ADCP is characterized by slow, strong contractions, which may occur locally or encompass the whole body. Clinically, physicians have also classified cerebral palsy according to the topographic distribution of muscle spasticity. This method classifies children as diplegic, (bilateral involvement with leg involvement greater than arm involvement), hemiplegic (unilateral involvement), or quadriplegic (bilateral involvement with arm involvement equal to or greater than leg involvement). Signs and symptoms ADCP is often characterized by slow, uncontrolled movements of the extremities and trunk. Small, rapid, random and repetitive, uncontrolled movements known as chorea may also occur. Involuntary movements often increase during periods of emotional stress or excitement and disappear when the patient is sleeping or distracted. Patients experience difficulty in maintaining posture and balance when sitting, standing, and walking due to these involuntary movements and fluctuations in muscle tone. Coordinated activities such as reaching and grasping may also be challenging. Muscles of the face and tongue can be affected, causing involuntary facial grimaces, expressions, and drooling. Speech and language disorders, known as dysarthria, are common in athetoid CP patients. In addition, ADCP patients may have trouble eating. Hearing loss is a common co-occurring condition, and visual disabilities can be associated with Athetoid Cerebral Palsy. Squinting and uncontrollable eye movements may be initial signs and symptoms. Children with these disabilities rely heavily on visual stimulation, especially those who are also affected by sensory deafness. Cognitive impairment occur in 30% of cases. Epilepsy occur in 25% of cases. Cause CP in general is a non-progressive, neurological condition that results from brain injury and malformation occurring before cerebral development is complete. ADCP is associated with injury and malformations to the extrapyramidal tracts in the basal ganglia or the cerebellum. Lesions to this region principally arise via hypoxic ischemic brain injury or bilirubin encephalopathy. =Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury= Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is a form of cerebral hypoxia in which oxygen cannot perfuse to cells in the brain. Lesions in the putamen and thalamus caused by this type of brain injury are primary causes of ADCP and can occur during the prenatal period and shortly after. Lesions that arise after this period typically occur as a result of injury or infections of the brain.Facts about cerebral palsy. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2012). Cerebral cortex and white matters are often relative spared, so intelligence is often normal. =Bilirubin encephalopathy= Bilirubin encephalopathy, also known as kernicterus, is the accumulation of bilirubin in the grey matter of the central nervous system. The main accumulation targets of hyperbilirubinemia are the basal ganglia, ocular movement nucleus, and acoustic nucleus of the brainstem. Pathogenesis of bilirubin encephalopathy involves several factors, including the transport of bilirubin across the blood-brain barrier and into neurons. Mild disruption results in left cognition impairment, while severe disruption results in ADCP. Lesions caused by accumulation of bilirubin occur mainly in the global pallidus and hypothalamus. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier by disease or a hypoxic ischemic injury can also contribute to an accumulation of bilirubin in the brain. Bilirubin encephalopathy leading to cerebral palsy has been greatly reduced by effective monitoring and treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants. As kernicterus has decreased due to improvements in care, over the last 50 years the proportion of children developing athetoid CP has decreased. In most cases, will have normal intelligence. Diagnosis =Motor function= Movement and posture limitations are aspects of all CP types and as a result, CP has historically been diagnosed based on parental reporting of developmental motor delays such as failure to sit upright, reach for objects, crawl, stand, or walk at the appropriate age. Diagnosis of ADCP is also based on clinical assessment used in conjunction with milestone reporting. The majority of ADCP assessments now use the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (formerly the International Classification of Impairments Disease, and Handicaps), measures of motor impairment that are effective in assessing severe CP. ADCP is typically characterized by an individual's inability to control their muscle tone, which is readily assessed via these classification systems. =Neuroimaging= Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to detect morphological brain abnormalities associated with ADCP in patients that are either at risk for ADCP or have shown symptoms thereof. The abnormalities chiefly associated with ADCP are lesions that appear in the basal ganglia. The severity of the disease is proportional to the severity and extent of these abnormalities, and is typically greater when additional lesions appear elsewhere in the deep grey matter or white matter. MRI also has the ability to detect brain malformation, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and areas affected by hypoxia-ischemia, all of which may play a role in the development of ADCP. The MRI detection rate for ADCP is approximately 54.5%, however this statistic varies depending on the patient's age and the cause of the disease and has been reported to be significantly higher. Treatment =Physical and occupational therapy= Physical therapy and Occupational Therapy are staple treatments of ADCP. Physical therapy is initiated soon after diagnosis and typically focuses on trunk strength and maintaining posture. Physical therapy helps to improve mobility, range of motion, functional ability, and quality of life. Specific exercises and activities prescribed by a therapist help to prevent muscles from deteriorating or becoming locked in position and help to improve coordination. Occupational therapy interventions for children with CP emphasises function, and therapists assist with activities of daily living, such as feeding, dressing, bathing and toileting, grooming. Various areas of occupation are also considered, and the occupational therapist may assist the child with pencil grasp and handwriting skills and play. The occupational therapist makes use of everyday activities in order to reach a functional outcome. =Speech therapy= Speech impairment is common in ADCP patients. Speech therapy is the treatment of communication diseases, including disorders in speech production, pitch, intonation, respiration and respiratory disorders. Exercises advised by a speech therapist or speech-language pathologist help patients to improve oral motor skills, restore speech, improve listening skills, and use communication aids or sign language if necessary. =Drug therapy= Medications that impede the release of excitatory neurotransmitters have been used to control or prevent spasms. Treatment with intrathecal baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, decreases muscle tone and has been shown to decrease the frequency of muscle spasms in ADCP patients. Tetrabenazine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Huntington's disease, has been shown to be effective treating chorea. =Deep brain stimulation= Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a technique that uses electrodes placed in the brain to modify brain activity by sending a constant electrical signal to the nearby nuclei. Treatment of muscle tone issues via deep brain stimulation typically targets the global pallidus and has shown to significantly improve symptoms associated with ADCP. The specific mechanism by which DBS affects ADCP is unclear. DBS of the globus pallidus interna improves dystonia in people with dyskinetic CP in 40% of cases, perhaps due to variation in basal ganglia injuries. Prognosis The severity of impairment and related prognosis is dependent on the location and severity of brain lesions. Up to 75% of patients will achieve some degree of ambulation. Speech problems, such as dysarthria, are common to these patients.

He played college football at California before signing with the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent in 2009. He has also been a member of the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL and the California Redwoods of the United Football League. Early life Sundberg was born in Phoenix, Arizona and played high school football at North Canyon High School. He played left tackle until his junior season, when the coaches moved him to center. Since the previous long snapper had graduated, his coaches also made him the long snapper that season. It was at this point, that Sundberg began training with Ben Bernard. Ben Bernard was Sundberg's offensive and defensive line coach at North Canyon. Sundberg also trained under him to become a better long snapper. They trained 5‚Äì6 days a week including lifting weights after Sundberg's senior season. Under Bernard's tutelage, Nick was able to earn a full scholarship to the University of California Berkeley. Sundberg continues to train with Bernard every off-season in Phoenix and now assists him in the training of younger long snappers. During his senior year, Sundberg was the team's captain and was named All- region honorable mention. Sundberg also participated in wrestling and track and field at North Canyon. College career Sundberg attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he played in 52 consecutive games and served as the long snapper for his entire four-year college career. He won the starting job in preseason as a true freshman and served as the long snapper on field goals and punts in all 13 games all four years at Cal. Sundberg graduated with a degree in legal studies in three-and-a-half years. Professional career =Carolina Panthers= Sundberg was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Carolina Panthers on April 28, 2009.

By the start of the 2010 season, he beat out Pro Bowl long snapper Ethan Albright, who was released early in the preseason, and free agent acquisition, James Dearth, for the team's long snapper position. In the 2012 season opener win against the New Orleans Saints, Sundberg broke his left arm late in the first half of the game and continued to play throughout the second half. On September 11, 2012, he was placed on the injured reserve list, but was designated to return and the Redskins signed Justin Snow to replace him. On November 6, the Redskins activated Sundberg from injured reserve list. Originally set to become a restricted free agent for the 2013 season, Sundberg agreed to a four-year contract to stay with the Redskins on March 10, 2013. In the Week 6 game against the Dallas Cowboys in 2013, he tore the meniscus in his right knee and was placed on injured reserve the next day. On January 23, 2017, Sundberg signed a four-year contract extension with the Redskins. On December 15, 2018, Sundberg was placed on injured reserve with a back injury. Personal life Sundberg resides in his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona during the offseason. Sundberg, with the Redskins Charitable Foundation, helped fund and start the Loads of Love program in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area.

It has nearly 1,000 church-school partnerships in 34 states across the U.S. with over 15,000 mentor-student relationships existing within these partnerships.  History  Kids Hope USA was founded in 1993. After asking experts in law enforcement, education, religion, and health and human services if churches could address the needs of growing numbers of at-risk children, a unanimous answer was given‚Äîchurches that mobilize and train their members to form one-to-one relationships with the youngest children can make a profound difference in their lives. Responding to this, in February 1995, Kids Hope USA initiated three pilot sites in Michigan. These programs triggered interest in many other communities, where church and school representatives soon requested program information.  The Kids Hope USA Way  The Kids Hope USA model was designed to teach churches how to give hope to at-risk public elementary schoolchildren through a relationship with a caring church member. The model relies on the interplay of four integral parts: \\\\--One child: an at- risk public elementary school child who needs a relationship with a caring adult; \\\\--One hour: sixty critical minutes each week when a trained mentor befriends a child and helps him or her acquire basic academic skills; \\\\--One church: a committed congregation who owns the program with its neighborhood school and provides a trained mentor and a behind-the-scenes prayer partner for each child; and \\\\--One school: a school that welcomes this proven intervention to increase the academic skills of at-risk children, at no cost to the school. Today, Kids Hope USA has helped nearly 1,000 Christian churches in 34 states engage their members in the lives of nearly 15,000 at-risk children.

It is located between Great Inagua (to the South) and Acklins Island (to the North). Hogsty is a bit of an oddity in the Atlantic basin. It is a 5√ó3 mile coral atoll rising up from 6,000 ft deep surrounding waters. Atolls are presumed to form from extinct volcanoes ‚Äì in a process whereby the volcano creates the sea mount which rises from the ocean depths, then subsides leaving a coral atoll. There are just a handful of these geological formations in the Atlantic, whereas there are hundreds in the Pacific. Hogsty is uninhabited and hardly anyone ever visits. There are just two tiny islands ‚Äì hardly larger than sandbars ‚Äì not enough to offer any real lee anchorage. The islands are small enough to walk/circumnavigate in 5‚Äì10 minutes. They do offer good shelling. Most charts and guides call out an anchorage in the lee of NW Cay. It is also possible to anchor at the head of the lagoon. The lagoon is mostly 20‚Äì30 ft deep with scattered coral heads. Good light is needed to navigate it. Once at the head of the lagoon, there is a large field of 10 ft sand to anchor in. The charts indicate areas of the reef dry at low water, which suggests good protection from surge at low tide, but as of 2009, little of the reef actually dries. There are two impressive shipwrecks on the reef. SS Richmond P. Hobson) One is a Liberty ship named Trebi≈°njica (ex SS Richmond P. Hobson), wrecked on the northern part of the reef 17 July 1963. As of 2009, this Liberty ship is well on its way to being reduced to dust. The superstructure is caving in and the hull is broken. The second shipwreck is on the southern part of the reef. It's much smaller than the Liberty ship ‚Äì and looks like a small inter-island freight boat ‚Äì maybe 120 feet long. The wreck appears to be much more recent and is in much better shape. The name is still plainly visible: Lady Eagle. Other wrecks: The slave ship , wrecked on Hogsty Reef on 9 December 1802 while returning to London after having delivered slaves from West Africa to Jamaica.

Early life Born in Egypt in 1939, Allam moved to the UK from Gamal Abdel Nasser's regime in Egypt in 1968. He studied economics at the University of Hull. Career After qualifying as an accountant, he started work at Tempest Diesel Limited (Co. Number 00335080). In 1981, he used a loan to begin a buy-out of the company. In 1992 the company was put into administrative receivership at the behest of Barclays Bank, along with Ruscador Shipyard Limited. Resulting in the redundancy of the company's entire workforce of more than 50. In the same year, he incorporated a purchase of the companies assets through a new company, Allam Marine Limited (Co. Number 02708090), subsequently leading the company to international success. Assem Allam and his son were included in the Sunday Times Rich List 2010. In 2006, he was named the UK Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young, the same firm of accountants who acted as Administrative Receivers of Tempest and Ruscador. Hull City A.F.C. In September 2010, there was speculation that Allam was interested in investing in Hull City A.F.C., the local football team, which had been relegated from the Premier League earlier in 2010 with extensive financial problems. On 18 October 2010 it was said that Allam, along with his son Ehab Allam, had entered negotiations with Hull City owner and chairman, Russell Bartlett. Allam confirmed at the time that he felt the need to \\"pay back to the area,\\" and that Hull City were important to the area. On 10 November 2010, the Allams said that a deal had been agreed for a controlling interest in the club, and that they would assume control once the relevant requirements had been met. While it was originally reported that Allam intended to only purchase a majority shareholding in the club, and would continue to work with Bartlett, a protracted period of due diligence indicated that the investment required would be substantially higher than originally planned; this resulted in a move to obtain complete shareholding control of the club. The deal was formally completed at 10:45 pm on 16 December 2010, with the club changing hands for the nominal fee of ¬£1, and with Allam and his son Ehab committing themselves to invest ¬£30 million, as well as providing assurance for a further ¬£10 million. Following the takeover, it was confirmed on the official club website that Assem Allam would take up the role of chairman at the club. On 4 May 2013, Hull City clinched promotion back to the Premier League. On 9 August 2013, Allam announced that the club would discard its 109-year old name and be, henceforth, \\"marketed\\" as Hull City Tigers locally and Hull Tigers to national and international audiences.\\"'Hull City irrelevant', says owner Assem Allam\\", The Daily Telegraph, 9 August 2013 Announcing the change in the Hull Daily Mail newspaper, he said: \\"'Hull City' is irrelevant...it is common. I want the club to be special. It is about identity. 'City' is a lousy identity. 'Hull City Association Football Club' is so long.\\" The club's Managing Director Nick Thompson urged supporters \\"to judge it in the fullness of time.\\" The announcement stated that all references to \\"AFC\\" on club branding will be phased out, although they will remain on the shirt crest during their first season back in the Premier League. On 12 September 2013, Allam, speaking to an interviewer, predicted that \\"in a few years many clubs will follow and change their names to something more interesting and I will have proved I am a leader.\\" He added that if he were the owner of Manchester City, he would change their name to \\"Manchester Hunter\\".\\"Assem Allam courts controversy and hands Hull City an identity crisis\\", The Guardian, 12 September 2013 Allam's plans to change the name of the club have been met with strong opposition from supporters of the club,Discussion on City fans' message boardCityTillWeDie website whose complaints he dismissed, stating \\"nobody questions my decisions in my business.\\" In response to the formation of a group opposed to the name change entitled \\"City Till We Die,\\" Allam responded that the supporters involved \\"can die as soon as they want, as long as they leave the club for the majority who just want to watch good football.\\" On 9 April 2014, the FA rejected Allam's proposal to change the club's name. Allam subsequently announced his intention to appeal the decision. Allam does not plan to attend any of the Championship club's matches this season. In early 2016, the club announced plans to replace the existing season ticket system with a new membership scheme, aiming to reduce match day costs for fans. The announcement was met with criticism from Hull City fans, with the scheme set to remove concessionary discounts and instead charge a flat rate to claim seats in particular sections of the stadium. It has also been suggested that the new system will force sections of fans to move to another area of the stadium to maintain their match day seats. Since the changes were announced, match day attendances at the KCOM Stadium have fallen significantly, with Hull City's 2016‚Äì17 campaign in the Premier League producing an average attendance figure of 20,761, a 12 per cent decrease on their previous season in the Premier League, while their 2017‚Äì18 campaign back in the Championship has so far been averaging just 15,980 fans. In spite of attendances falling, vice-chairman Ehab Allam has defended the new scheme, and has stated that it will remain. Allam's running of the club came under criticism in the summer of 2016, when after Hull City had regained promotion to the Premier League, the club only had twelve fit senior professionals available to play in the club's opening day fixture against reigning champions Leicester City, with no acquisitions having been made since their Championship play-off final win and with no permanent manager in place after Steve Bruce's resignation in the off-season. Allam's ownership of the club again came under scrutiny in the summer of 2017, following Hull's relegation from the Premier League, where upwards of seven key first team players were sold during the transfer window. Hull again started a season with a threadbare squad depleted by injuries, and made a poor start to their first season back in the Championship under manager Leonid Slutsky. He was sacked just months into the new season in early December, with the club having been on a poor run of two wins in 15 games, and firmly in a relegation battle. As of late 2017, the club has still been made available for sale by the Allam family, with Assem Allam stating that the club \\"is no closer to being sold\\". Allam has cited issues with the club's stadium ownership and \\"militant\\" fan backlash surrounding the running of the club as reasons for a potential sale being delayed. Hull Kingston Rovers In May 2011, Allam gave a ¬£1 million gift to Hull Kingston Rovers rugby league club \\"to be used for stadium improvements and strengthening the playing staff\\". Squash sponsorship In October 2011, Allam signed a three-year sponsorship of the British Open Squash Championships. The event was successfully moved to Kingston upon Hull in 2013 and repeated in 2014 and 2015. The Allam sponsorship has continued until the 2019 event when his sponsorship of the event was renewed. Philanthropy In 2016 he donated ¬£7 million towards the cost of a ¬£25 million medical building at the University of Hull. In November 2019, he donated around ¬£8 million to Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust for the creation of a diabetes treatment and research centre based at Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle Hill Hospital. He is a former donor to the Labour Party.

Vocals are provided by Mel Fuhrman. It was recorded at A&R; Studios, New York City in two sessions, on April 29 (tracks 1, 2, 4 & 6), and May 7 (tracks 3 & 5), 1968. Reception Phil Freeman noted \\"The interplay between the two saxophonists was fierce, and the rhythm section, borrowed from John Coltrane, combined powerhouse swing with an ineffable gravitas. This feeling of greater grounded- ness is what makes New York is Now! and Love Call unique among Coleman‚Äôs discography, whether on Blue Note or otherwise; the tempos aren‚Äôt much slower than on his other mid ‚Äô60s albums, but they feel somehow heavier here, Jones driving the beat as Garrison strums his bass like a massive guitar. The two albums don‚Äôt even seem to exist as separate entities‚Äîthey feel like two halves of a whole, the compositions all sharing the ebullience and, in their slower moments, the deep feeling of the blues that have marked Ornette‚Äôs music since the 1950s\\".Freeman, P. Good Old Days: Ornette Coleman on Blue Note, bluenote.com, December 18 2012 Allmusic awarded the album three stars and reviewer Thom Jurek stated \\"New York Is Now is one of the true curiosity pieces in Ornette's catalog\\". Jurek sees the album finding Coleman \\"in some sense, at odds with himself\\" and the rhythm section, which he finds \\"a lot more modally than harmonically propelled\\". In particular, he identifies drummer Elvin Jones as sounding restricted by the album's slow tempos. Jurek is also unfavourable about Coleman's violin playing. On the whole, he characterises New York Is Now as \\"pleasant and amusing if not amazing\\". Release history The album was originally released as an LP by Blue Note Records in 1968.

He was a member of the Swedish parliament from the 2010 election until the next election in 2014, representing the Gothenburg Municipality constituency. Biography Waberi was born in Somalia. Prior to entering politics, he worked as a principal at the R√∂mosseskolan Islamic private elementary school in Gothenburg. The school teaches islamic doctrine two hours a week, more than other schools. It is taught that a man can have many wives, which is contrary to the values of the Swedish education system which specifies equality between men and women. The institution was criticized by the Swedish School Inspectorate (sv: Skolinspektionen) for its unusual grading pattern, wherein all the ninth grade boys within the system graduated with full marks and were eligible to apply for college, while a lower 71% of girls graduated with full marks. This was in contrast to the gender ratio typically seen in other local schools in Sweden, where the girls tended to outperform the boys. In the 2010 election, Waberi was elected to the Swedish parliament, representing the Gothenburg Municipality constituency. He was a deputy member of the legislature's Committee on Defence. Waberi has served as the vice president of Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe (FIOE), where he headed the citizenship and public relations duties. In addition, Waberi has served as the chairman of several organizations, including the Islamic Association in Sweden, Muslim Political Forum and Islamic Schools of Sweden. He is also a member of the board of the Muslim Council of Sweden. Waberi lives in Angered, Gothenburg. He is married, with five children.  Religious views  In a 2006 interview by the Ottar magazine published by the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU), he stated that according to the Quran, that a man may have up to four wives. He also stated a man is capable of loving four wives, but that woman cannot love four men. According to Waberi, Islam teaches that a Muslim man may marry a woman of a different religion, but a Muslim woman must marry a Muslim man.

It argues that climate change will bring about large-scale, harmful consequences for habitability for life on Earth including humans, which it is too late to prevent. Hamilton explores why politicians, corporations and the public deny or refuse to act on this reality. He invokes a variety of explanations, including wishful thinking, ideology, consumer culture and active lobbying by the fossil fuel industry. The book builds on the author's fifteen-year prior history of writing about these subjects, with previous books including Growth Fetish and Scorcher: The Dirty Politics of Climate Change. Requiem for a Species has been reviewed in Resurgence magazine, Socialist Review, Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Common Review, and Times Higher Education, which named it \\"Book of the Week\\". Extracts of the book have appeared in The Guardian and Geographical magazine. The book won a 2010 Queensland Premier's Literary Award. Themes Hamilton points out that there have been many reports and books over the years explaining the climate change problem and just how ominous the future looks for humanity. He says Requiem for a Species is primarily about why those warnings have been ignored. Hamilton considers that sometimes an inconvenient truth may be too difficult to bear: > Sometimes facing up to the truth is just too hard. When the facts are > distressing it is easier to reframe or ignore them. Around the world only a > few have truly faced up to the facts about global warming... It's the same > with our own deaths; we all \\"accept\\" that we will die, but it is only when > our death is imminent that we confront the true meaning of our mortality. The most immediate reason for the failure to act on global warming is seen to be the \\"sustained and often ruthless exercise of political power by the corporations who stand to lose from a shift to low- and zero-carbon energy systems\\". Hamilton cites numerous journalists and authors who have documented the influence of large companies such as ExxonMobil, Rio Tinto Group and General Motors. Hamilton makes his argument in three stages: > Firstly, he reviews the evidence about how serious the situation is already > and how much worse it will get. Secondly, he examines the roots of denial, > both in terms of resistance to the evidence and in relation to the actors > and agencies motivated to deny climate change. Lastly, he looks at some > future scenarios and explains what people should do. Hamilton suggests that the foundations of climate change denial lie in the reaction of American conservatism to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He argues that as the \\"red menace\\" receded, conservatives who had put energy into opposing communism sought other outlets. Hamilton contends that the conservative backlash against climate science was led by three prominent physicists ‚Äì Frederick Seitz, Robert Jastrow, and William Nierenberg. In 1984 Seitz, Jastrow and Nierenberg founded the George C. Marshall Institute, and in the 1990s the Marshall Institute's main activity was attacking climate science. When describing climate science, Hamilton says that official numbers published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are highly cautious, and so the real effects of climate change will likely be even more severe. His conclusion is that it will not be possible to stabilise emissions: > ... even with the most optimistic set of assumptions ‚Äì the ending of > deforestation, a halving of emissions associated with food production, > global emissions peaking in 2020 and then falling by 3 per cent a year for a > few decades ‚Äì we have no chance of preventing emissions rising well above a > number of critical tipping points that will spark uncontrollable climate > change. The Earth's climate would enter a chaotic era lasting thousands of > years before natural processes eventually establish some sort of > equilibrium. Whether human beings would still be a force on the planet, or > even survive, is a moot point. One thing seems certain: there will be far > fewer of us. In terms of Australia, Hamilton says that \\"Australians in 2050 will be living in a nation transformed by a changing climate, with widespread doubt over whether we will make it to the end of the century in a land that is recognisably Australian\\". Reception Michael Lynn in The Common Review says that Requiem for a Species explores the gulf between acknowledgment and acceptance of climate change. Lynn explains that the gulf has two main origins and no easy solution: > Hamilton ... argues that the gulf has two primary origins: the enormity of > its consequences and the way it challenges how we as individuals and as > societies have constructed our identities over the past three centuries. In > doing so, he suggests that meeting the challenge of climate change requires > far more than implementing the right policies and making minor adjustments > in our lifestyles. Instead, it implies remaking our psyches and societies on > a scale unseen since the dawn of the modern age. The Times Higher Education listed Requiem for a Species as \\"Book of the week\\" for 3 June 2010. Steven Yearley's review calls it a \\"provocative and sobering book\\". He says the heart of the book are the many explanations that Hamilton puts forward for the everyday, regular denial of the danger of changing climate. Yearley says this is also the most frustrating aspect of Requiem for a Species, because Hamilton proposes so many different explanations but does not make their relative significance clear. David Shearman, in a review for Doctors for the Environment Australia, says that \\"Clive Hamilton is one of Australia's most notable public intellectuals, his work is careful and balanced, he presents the facts as they are and has written a book which is uncomfortable for all\\". According to Shearman, Hamilton's treatment of the topic of denial is one of the best available. Mike Hulme, in Resurgence magazine, agrees with the \\"consumption fetish\\" and \\"spiritual malaise\\" of humanity that Hamilton describes. But, according to Hulme, Hamilton has underestimated the \\"innovative and creative potential of collective humanity\\" and he has put too much faith in the infallibility of science's predictions about future climate risks. Hulme believes that Hamilton \\"is placing too much weight on the foresight of science to provide his desired revolution, rather than calling for it more honestly and directly through political, psychological or spiritual engagement\\". Kelsey Munro reviewed the book in the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism is not the same thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late. Camilla Royle reviewed Requiem for a Species in Socialist Review and recommends it for those who want to get a clearer idea of climate change science. She says that Hamilton is understandably angry at the corporate lobbyists who have encouraged climate change denial. Royle suggests that Hamilton accepts that \\"we should at least try to do something about climate change\\", but he \\"doesn't give much idea of what that something is\\".Royle, Camilla (May 2010).

He joined professional sumo in 2005, reaching the top division in 2010. He has been runner-up three times in January 2011, March 2013, and November 2017 tournaments all with an 11‚Äì4 record. His highest rank has been sekiwake, which he held for one tournament in March 2015 and then held again in November 2016. He has won four Fighting Spirit prizes to date, one for Outstanding Performance, and four gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He wrestles for Hakkaku stable. Early life and sumo background At school he attended local sumo clubs and took part in national competitions, but had no desire to take up sumo as a profession, instead wanting to go to sea and taking examinations to become a licensed mariner. However, he ended up dropping out of high school and was introduced by an acquaintance to Hakkaku-oyakata, the 61st yokozuna Hokutoumi, who persuaded him to join his Hakkaku stable. Okinoumi is known for his good looks. His stablemaster joked at a press conference after Okinoumi's promotion to j≈´ry≈ç that this made him envious. Career He began his professional career in January 2005, fighting under his family name of Fukuoka. He was promoted to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division after taking the y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship in the makushita division in January 2009 with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record. He changed his shikona to Okinoumi, a reference to his birthplace of Okinoshima (a tiny and remote island in Western Japan) which had been suggested by his father. He became the first sekitori from the Oki Islands since 1960. Troubled by a shoulder injury, he was demoted from j≈´ry≈ç after two losing records, but after reverting to the name Fukuoka he won immediate promotion back to j≈´ry≈ç in July 2009. Fighting as Okinoumi once again, in January 2010 he won promotion to the top makuuchi division, becoming the first wrestler from Shimane Prefecture to do so in 88 years. He came through with a kachi-koshi or winning record in his debut makuuchi tournament in March, winning his last three bouts to score 8‚Äì7. This saw him promoted to maegashira 10 for May. He was suspended from the July 2010 tournament, along with several other wrestlers, after admitting involvement in illegal gambling on baseball. As a result, he dropped back to j≈´ry≈ç for September. Ranked at j≈´ry≈ç 8, a 10‚Äì5 record was enough to return him to the top division for the November tournament, where he secured his majority of wins on the final day. His best performance to date came in the January 2011 tournament where he finished runner-up to yokozuna Hakuh≈ç and received his first sansh≈ç award, for Fighting Spirit. This saw him promoted to a new highest rank of maegashira 4 for the May 2011 \\"technical examination tournament.\\" There he fought all the top-ranked men for the first time and defeated three ≈çzeki: Kai≈ç, Harumafuji and Koto≈çsh≈´. He lost his last two bouts, to komusubi Kakury≈´ and Toyonoshima, to fall to a make-koshi 7‚Äì8 but remained at the same rank for the next tournament. Securing his majority of wins on the final day of the July tournament, he reached a new highest rank of maegashira 1 in September. He achieved his first gold star win against Harumafuji in November 2012, and his second Fighting Spirit award at maegashira 7 in March 2013. He managed two non-consecutive komusubi appearances in 2013, but he slid down the rankings after four consecutive losing tournaments in the following year. Following the January tournament in 2015 he was promoted to sekiwake from the relatively low rank of maegashira 6, benefiting from the failure of most of those ranked directly above him to get winning records. He was injured in his sekiwake debut and had to withdraw from the tournament. Nine win in May and eleven in July saw him promoted to the san'yaku ranks for the fourth time (three at komusubi, and one at sekiwake). He was unable to hold the rank, scoring 6‚Äì9, and he also had a losing record in his fourth attempt at komusubi in May 2016. He picked up a kinboshi from maegashira 2 in July 2016, and had a very successful start to the September tournament, defeating ≈çzeki Kisenosato on opening day, Kakury≈´ on Day 2 and Harumafuji on Day 3. By the sixth day he had defeated two yokozuna and three ozeki and was the undefeated tournament co- leader. However he began losing in the second week of the tournament and finished on 9‚Äì6. He was rewarded for this efforts with his first Outstanding Performance Prize, and promotion back to sekiwake. The November 2016 tournament did not go well for Okinoumi who had a lingering injury that had caused him to miss the autumn tour. He ended the tournament with only a 5‚Äì10 record and fell back to the maegashira ranks. In the November 2017 tournament Okinoumi was a runner-up to Hakuh≈ç with an 11‚Äì4 record, and was awarded his third Fighting Spirit prize, shared with Aminishiki. In July 2020 Okinoumi returned to the komusubi rank for the first time since 2016, and secured his first winning record in sanyaku with a 9‚Äì6 score. He is the owner of the Kimigahama toshiyori kabu or elder stock (currently being borrowed by former maegashira Hochiyama), indicating he intends to stay in sumo as a coach upon his retirement. Fighting style Okinoumi is a yotsu-sumo fighter, preferring grappling techniques to pushing or thrusting. His most common winning kimarite is yori-kiri or force out, and he favours a migi-yotsu grip on the mawashi, with his left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. He also regularly uses uwatenage, or overarm throw.

(See -up for further details). In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. The town--set in Salmon Gum woodland-- features a series of tin sculptures. The sculptures are placed in various locations around the town. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops.

When Alisa learns that her mother is having trysts with their boarder she sees it as her mother's betrayal of her father and burns down the house. After an eclipse of the sun, Alisa stops talking. Alisa is then sent to a school for mentally disabled children, where she discovers a magical ability to fulfill her wishes. After wishing to move away and causing a hurricane, she, her mother, and grandmother move to Moscow.

After wishing that she could study at the university the student who had placed just above her dies in a car accident qualifying her for school. After a miserable 18th birthday Alisa contemplates suicide by jumping off a bridge. Before she can jump a more determined man jumps first. In shock Alisa jumps in after the stranger and saves his life. Instantly falling in love Alisa begins to talk again. The stranger's name is Sasha and while initially welcoming of Alisa in the morning, after he sobers up, he is rude and dismissive. Though Alisa tells him she is a ballerina he hires her as a cleaner. Sasha scams people by selling them property on the Moon, Venus, and Mars. To escape what he is doing he parties every night and then becomes suicidal. Alisa rescues him a second time but in the morning he once again is rude and cruel. Returning to Sasha's home a third night Alisa meets a woman named Rita who tells her that a simple spell to win a man's heart is to smoke a cigarette with his name on it. Rita and Alisa smoke cigarettes together, unaware that they have both written Sasha's name on it. In the morning, while still rude and abrupt Sasha asks Alisa to join him for coffee and brings her to work where he is casting children for an ad for his service. The casting director becomes enamoured of Alisa and they cast her as their \\"Lunar girl\\". To celebrate Sasha takes her drinking and then steals pineapples for her. Their night is ruined when Alisa takes a childhood game of \\"Make the Dead Laugh\\" too far. The following morning Alisa wakes up in Sasha's apartment and discovers Rita there. She learns Rita is Sasha's girlfriend of a year. Returning to Sasha's apartment that night, dressed in a mascot costume from her other job, she sees him and Rita having sex and calls him a traitor. The incident causes Rita to believe Sasha is cheating on her and to break up with him. That night Alisa has a prophetic dream that Sasha dies while on a plane. She calls him to try to stop him from boarding and tells him that her grandmother died in his apartment and she is alone with the corpse, causing him to reluctantly miss his flight. He later learns that the flight he was supposed to be on was involved in a collision killing everyone on board. Realizing that the details Alisa gave him don't match up and that he has no way of contacting her, Sasha sees Alisa on the street and tries to chase her down. He loses track of her, and in the meantime she is hit by a car and dies. As Sasha continues to search for Alisa he runs into Rita and tells her he was looking for her.

It gained its name because at the outset most of its members were loyal to the new king. The Whigs, who had previously resisted James's inheriting the throne, were outnumbered both in the Commons and in the Lords. In May 1685 the Parliament treated James generously in financial matters, but by November of the same year it had developed concerns about the direction he was taking, so he prevented it from meeting again. No other parliament was held by James before he fled the country on 18 December 1688 as a result of the Glorious Revolution. Background James's greatest political problem was his known Roman Catholicism, which left him alienated from both political parties in England, but most of all from the Whigs. Between 1679 and 1681 the Whigs had failed in their attempts to pass the Exclusion Bill to exclude James from the throne, but his brother Charles II had had great trouble in defeating this campaign. James's supporters were the High Anglican Tories. The origins of the Tories as a political faction were in the Abhorrers, those who had opposed the Exclusion Bill.Clement Boulton Roylance Kent, The early history of the Tories: from the accession of Charles the Second to the death of William the Third (1660‚Äì1702) (1908), pp. 258‚Äì264 Elections Elections to the House of Commons, especially in the boroughs, were heavily influenced by the king. Following the Exclusion crisis, ninety-nine boroughs had received new charters, the aim being to eliminate the influence of the Whigs. Partly as a result of this, there were only fifty-seven Whigs in the new House of Commons, in which only four years before they had held a majority.Clyve Jones, Britain in the first age of party, 1680‚Äì1750: essays presented to Geoffrey Holmes (1987), p. 56 online at books.google.com Yet the Whigs also lost seats in county constituencies that weren't liable to charter manipulation, dropping from around sixty county seats in 1681 to only eight. In the new parliament, the Tories now had their own majority in both houses, Commons and Lords. Events Lord Jeffreys, the Lord Chancellor The king had summoned parliament for 19 May, when it first met, and on 22 May John Trevor, a Tory and a supporter of James, was confirmed as Speaker of the Commons.Charles Deering, Rupert Cecil Chicken, Nottinghamia vetus et nova: or, An historical account of the ancient and present state of the town of Nottingham (1751), p. 217 online at books.google.comDavid Hayton, Eveline Cruickshanks, & Stuart Handley, The House of Commons, 1690‚Äì1715 vol. 2 (2002), p. 683 The king had appointed Lord Jeffreys as Lord Chancellor. The first session of the parliament lasted from 19 May until 2 July 1685. From 1414 until 1625, it had been customary at the beginning of each new monarch's reign for parliament to grant him or her the duties of tonnage and poundage for life. The parliament of 1625, the first of Charles I's reign, had broken with tradition by granting them for one year only.Michael J. Braddick, The nerves of state: taxation and the financing of the English state, 1558‚Äì1714 p. 52 online At the outset of the 1685 debate in the Commons on this matter, Sir Edward Seymour, a Tory, moved that the House conduct an investigation into irregularities about the election of some of its members before granting any revenues to the king, but no-one seconded this motion. The parliament proceeded to give James tonnage and poundage for life and it also gave him high impositions on sugar and tobacco, in defiance of the protests from producers and traders in those commodities.Nuala Zahedieh, The Capital and the Colonies: London and the Atlantic Economy 1660‚Äì1700, p. 50 online at books.google.com A historian of the period has called the Parliament \\"the most loyal Parliament a Stewart ever had\\".George Henry Wakeling, King and Parliament (A.D. 1603‚Äì1714) (2008), p. 91: \\"...and thus the most loyal Parliament a Stewart ever had was prorogued...\\" The unsuccessful Monmouth Rebellion in the south-west of England of June and July 1685, and a smaller simultaneous rebellion in Scotland led by the Earl of Argyll, demonstrated that the country was divided over accepting James as King, but the rebels acted without parliamentary support.John Miller, The Stuarts (2004), pp. 140‚Äì143Tim Harris, Revolution: the Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685‚Äì1720 (Penguin Books, 2006, ), pp. 73‚Äì86 In November 1685, Lord Delamere was tried in the House of Lords for treason for his complicity in the Rebellion. James appointed Judge Jeffreys to preside as Lord High Steward, and Jeffreys chose thirty peers as Triers to sit with him. As Macaulay later pointed out, the thirty men chosen were all \\"in politics vehemently opposed to the prisoner\\", and fifteen were colonels of regiments, appointments from which the king could remove them. Nevertheless, to James's anger all thirty voted for acquittal, and this marked the end of the period of vengeance upon the rebels.Winston Churchill, Marlborough: his Life and Times, vol. 1, p. 204 online at books.google.comRuth Tyler Bryant, George Jeffreys, first Baron Jeffreys of Wem (2007) online at thegloriousrevolution.org During the Rebellion, James raised substantial forces to oppose it and also commissioned many Roman Catholics to command them. Following the Rebellion, it became clear that unlike his brother, Charles, James had no intention of letting go of the extra forces he had raised and planned to maintain a much larger standing army than before. He was able to do this because parliament had put him in a strong financial position. This raised fears that the country would in future not only be governed by a Popish king but that he would be supported by an army of the same persuasion.John Childs, The Army, James II, and the Glorious Revolution (Manchester University Press, 1980), p. 10 online at books.google.com On 9 November 1685, James made a speech to Parliament in which he announced that he proposed to do away with the Test Acts which prohibited Roman Catholics from holding public offices, and in particular that he intended to keep many as army officers. This met strong opposition from Tories as well as Whigs. In a crucial vote on 13 November on whether to proceed with supplying funds to the king before discussing the nation's grievances, James's loyalists were defeated by his opponents by one vote, with 182 voting for the court and 183 against.Scott Sowerby, \\"Tories in the Whig Corner: Daniel Fleming's Journal of the 1685 Parliament,\\" Parliamentary History, vol. 24 (2005), p. 160. James's response was to prorogue Parliament on 20 November 1685. It did not meet again, with James choosing to silence the opposition of his parliament by a series of prorogations. The first was from 20 November until 15 February 1685/6, the next to 28 April, and the third to 22 November 1686. There were two more prorogations in 1687, and the parliament was finally dissolved by proclamation on 2 July 1687.Robert Beddard, A Kingdom without a king: the journal of the provisional government in the revolution of 1688 (1988), p. 197 Aftermath No further parliaments met before King James was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although he summoned a parliament in September 1688, with the intention of having it meet in November, the elections to the Commons were cancelled, due to the imminent invasion of William of Orange.London Gazette, no. 2386 (27 Sept.-1 Oct 1688) After a disastrous campaign against William's forces, James retreated to London before finally fleeing the country on 18 December 1688. An irregular Convention Parliament met on 22 January 1688/9, summoned by William. It consisted of the House of Lords and the surviving members of the Commons from the Oxford Parliament of 1681, the last of Charles II's reign. This assembly invited William III and Mary II to take what it considered to be the vacant throne.George L. Cherry, The Convention Parliament, 1689: a biographical study of its members (1966)  In literature The short and stormy history of the Loyal Parliament is depicted in Robert Neil's historical novel \\"Lillibulero\\". The book's protagonist, although a Tory member of Parliament, is alarmed by the King's intention to keep a standing army and to restore the Church of Rome, so is drawn into an alliance with the minority Whigs to defy the King. This draws on him the King's anger and ultimately leads to his supporting the Glorious Revolution three years later.

Jennings (20 May 1921 - 19 January 1997) was a comic book artist who lived and worked in the United Kingdom. Biography Richard E. Jennings was born in Hampstead, England. In 1937 he won a free place to the Central School of Arts, London. After 2 years his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War, during which he served in the Air/Sea Rescue service of the Royal Air Force in the Middle East. Following demobilisation he travelled around England before taking work as a fisherman, and decorating public houses and hotels in the Devon area for a brewery company. Moving to London in 1950, he secured a position with the newly launched Eagle comic. His first work was on the Tommy Walls strip (advertising Wall's ice cream). He worked on this for the next three years, eventually writing the scripts as well as providing the artwork. In October 1953 Jennings commenced work as the artist on the new Eagle Storm Nelson maritime adventure strip, in collaboration with film screenwriter Guy Morgan. After Morgan left he continued both drawing and writing the strip until its cancellation in March 1962. Further work for the Eagle followed during that year, with his last strip for the comic being 'Island of Fire' which ran from July to October 1962. Jennings' work was not confined to the Eagle. Other commissions included strips for the Junior Mirror, Swift and early episodes of The Daleks comic strip for TV Century 21. He also provided artwork for several annuals. By the late 1960s Jennings had ceased working as a comic strip artist. At one point he was employed as a long-distance lorry driver, supplementing his income by travelling around the Yorkshire Dales during his spare time painting pub signs and portraits. In later years Jennings retired to Cornwall. He died of pneumonia on 19 January 1997, aged 75.

The school is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health. The school operates on three university campuses: the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colo., Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colo. and the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, Colo.  History  The school officially opened on July 1, 2008, following decades of dedicated development. Planning for the school was initiated by a partnership of public health practitioners, academics, and business leaders. The partnership formed an official taskforce in 2002 in order to develop a strategic plan and seek the funding necessary to open a school of public health. The task force was successful and instrumental in the decision to open the school as a collaboration. In August 2007, each university president or chancellor signed a memorandum of agreement to open the school and the founding dean was appointed that December. Within months the school admitted its first class of students, setting the stage for growth future development.

Built between 1982 and 1993 as part of the seven-strong s, the last five ships of the class were given a comprehensive midlife upgrade between 2007 and 2010, which resulted in HMS Koster becoming the lead ship of the newly upgraded class of MCMVs. After the upgrade, the Swedish Navy expects that it will serve on for another 15 to 20 years. An identifying feature of the Koster class is the fire control radar on top of the bridge. Overview In December 2004, the Swedish Navy awarded Kockums a contract for the mid-life upgrade for five of the Landsort class (excluding HMS Landsort and HMS Arholma). The upgrade includes a new mine countermeasures (MCM) system, adaptations for international operations as well as a new air defence systems involving moving and modification of the Arte 726 from the Kaparen class fast patrol boats. The first is expected to be completed in 2008. The upgraded vessels will be renamed as the Koster class, as the first vessel to be upgraded is HMS Koster (formerly the third ship in the Landsort class). On 31 January 2005 a contract exceeding ‚Ç¨30 million was awarded to Atlas Elektronik for the upgrade of these five vessels with the Atlas Integrated MCM Systems (IMCMS-S). The systems will be commissioned into operational service between 2008 and 2009. The system combines minehunting, minesweeping, mine disposal, surveillance and communication with other naval forces. It comprises an Atlas MCM Tactical Command and Control system, a broadband Atlas HMS-12M hull-mounted sonar and an Atlas mine identification and disposal system (MIDS) Seafox. The IMCMS-S onboard also fully integrates sensors and effectors like the self-propelled variable depth sonar, underwater positioning system, navigation radar and sensors, conventional MIDS systems, and air defence system. The vessels are also upgraded to have Link 16 capability.

The property is located along North Laurel Street at 823 Cathedral Place, facing Monroe Park one block north of Main Street. Construction of the cathedral was begun in 1903, financed by donations of Thomas Fortune Ryan and his wife; it was the only cathedral at that time known to be constructed by the exclusive patronage of a single family. The cathedral was completed in 1905 and consecrated on Thanksgiving Day, November 29, 1906. The cathedral is a Virginia Historic Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart hosts the Catholic Campus Ministry for Virginia Commonwealth University. Background Virginia-born Thomas Fortune Ryan converted to Roman Catholicism en route to Baltimore, Maryland in 1868. In Baltimore Ryan made his fortune in railroads and streetcar transit and married Ida Mary Barry, the daughter of a Catholic former employer. Ida contributed to various Catholic charities and causes, including in Virginia, but the Ryans' philanthropy in Richmond increased after they purchased a 5000-acre plot in Nelson County, Virginia. In 1901 Ida donated money to build a church dedicated to the Sacred Heart in Manchester (now part of Richmond) so that worshippers did not have to cross the James River for services. She also provided funds for the construction of a school, a new chapel convent, and churches in Harrisonburg and Newport News (St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church). They also funded projects in Washington, D.C. and New York. In 1901 Ida and Ryan each donated $250,000 to build a cathedral overlooking Monroe Park near the Fan district‚Äîin today's money, equivalent to $. Historically, Richmond did not have a large or influential Catholic population, but it was growing at the turn of the century. Part of the plot for the church had been owned by the Diocese since 1865. The parish had planned for a $120,000 church at the location since 1882, but an effort to purchase the rest of the triangular block stalled until the Ryans' gift. Construction The Ryans chose Joseph Hubert McGuire as the church's architect. The church, bishop's house and pastoral home fill the entire block. The cornerstone was laid June 4, 1903, by Father Conway of St. Ignatius, New York; the stone block came from the Garden of Gethsemane. According to a diocesan official, it was the only cathedral in the world erected through the \\"sole munificence of one family\\". The building is an example of Italian Renaissance Revival architecture. The exterior is constructed from Virginia granite and Indiana limestone; ceramic tiles and a copper-jacketed dome across complete the roof. The cathedral's two front towers rise . The portico is supported by fluted Corinthian columns; the entablature features the phrase \\"If Ye Love Me Keep My Commandments\\", while the underside of the pediment is lined with fireproof tiles designed by Rafael Guastavino. The cathedral was consecrated on Thanksgiving Day, November 29, 1906 in a series of ceremonies throughout the day. The church's consecration began at 6 am. In the time period following the Second Vatican Council, the cathedral made radical alterations to its interior. The original high altar was destroyed and a freestanding altar was installed. The nave was enlarged and room made for a larger, more open sanctuary. The marble altar rails, present in the building since its construction, were destroyed. Confessionals were repurposed into display cases. Iconography and statuary which had previously adorned the sanctuary was removed. Landmark The cathedral is a Virginia Historic Landmark and is on the National Register for Historic Places.

He was a well-known criminal for hire on the New York waterfront during the post-American Civil War era and later became a member of Patsy Conroy Gang. Mahoney also participated in a number of violent robberies during the early-1870s, including his time leading a group of Fourth Ward railroad thieves, although he usually escaped punishment due to his political connections to Tammany Hall. These activities, however, would lead to his eventual imprisonment by New York District Attorneys Benjamin K. Phelps and Horace Russell in 1873. Biography Michael Mahoney was born in the old Fourth Ward in Manhattan. He began his criminal career while still a young child and became a skilled thief within a few years. He regularly visited the underworld den known as Slaughter-house Point, so named because of the alleged murders which occurred within the establishment, located at the corner of James Slip and Water Street. It was there that he learned his trade from such notorious criminal figures such as Johnny Dobbs, Jack Lowry, John McClosky, Soldier Brown and others. By early adulthood, Mahoney had risen from a low-level dock rat to a criminal whose name had \\"become known to every detective in the country\\". His portrait (No. 688) was eventually added to the Rogue's Gallery at Central Office of the New York Police Department. In the years following the American Civil War, Mahoney established himself as a much feared criminal figure on the New York waterfront and eventually recruited by Patsy Conroy to join his gang of river pirates.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 73) Sante, Luc. Low Life: Lures and Snares of Old New York. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2003. (pg. 207) During this period, Mahoney also worked with Thomas Cummings, Denis Brady, Joe Dollard, Martin Broderick, Sam Lake, John \\"Johnny the Greek\\" Keefe and Abe Coakley among others. He and Broderick staged the successful escape of Coakley from the state penitentiary in 1869. From the city-side of the East River, the two men signaled a guard-boat carrying Coakley by waving handkerchiefs. The keeper, believing it was a doctor who wanted the boat, stopped to pick him up. When the boat docked, however, Mahoney and Broderick drew their revolvers and held the guard at gunpoint while Coakley jumped ashore and escaped. Shortly afterwards, Mahoney and Broderick were involved in the robbery of a messenger boy of Stevens Bank in Hoboken, New Jersey. The bank messenger was robbed by the two men while travelling to the Stevens floating battery. After knocking him \\"senseless\\" with a sandbag, they jumped into a boat in waiting and rowed back to New York. Their escape was short- lived as they were quickly apprehended by Hoboken Police Chief Charles A. Donovan. A subsequent investigation found that Mahoney and Broderick had rented rooms across from the bank and watched the messenger for weeks waiting for the perfect opportunity to make their move. Due to the messengers injuries, he was unable to identify his assailants and Mahoney and Donovan were discharged. A year later, he was convicted with Denis Brady and Thomas Cummings for nearly beating to death local merchant Albert Bornowsky. Mahoney's political influence with Tammany Hall resulted in a mere six-month prison sentence. By early 1873, Mahoney was the leader of a gang of railroad thieves in the Fourth Ward. On April 5, Mahoney assaulted Peter R. Corson while boarding a Third Avenue street car with his small son. Mahoney, with two other gang members, blocked the front platform and then grabbed him by the neck and stole a pocketbook which had $45. The gang leader was later arrested and brought before the Court of General Sessions later that month. Assistant District Attorney Horace Russell prosecuted the case and said, in his opening statement, that Mahoney was \\"one of a class of villains who should be taught that the railroads of the City were intended for the conveyance of honest citizens, and not for the operations of gangs of thieves\\". Russell and his team vowed to \\"spare no pains\\" in bringing these men to justice. Mahoney was found guilty by Recorder John K. Hackett and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment at the New York State Prison. Prior to his conviction, John Keefe and Abe Coakley used \\"every underhanded effort\\" to save Donovan from incarceration but were prevented in their efforts by District Attorney Benjamin K. Phelps.

Mericle, U.S. Navy, an electronics technician at McMurdo Station, 1967. Location Mericle Rock is located in the center of Campbell Glacier in Victoria Land, Antarctica. Victoria Land is located in eastern Antarctica, with the Ross Sea to the east and Wilkes Land to the west. Victoria Land is located north of the Ross Ice Shelf. Sir James Clark Ross led the expedition who discovered the region in 1841, naming it after Queen Victoria. Campbell Glacier is about 60 miles long and begins near the south end of the Mesa Range. It drains southeast between Deep Freeze Range and Mount Melbourne to discharge in north Terra Nova Bay. The Northern Party, led by Lieutenant Victor L.A. Campbell, observed the lower end of the glacier. The glacier was named for the leader, who worked for the Royal Navy from 1910 to 1913. Geography Nunataks are small rock areas that emerge above glaciers and ice sheets. Because they are typically isolated from the main mountains, they are often easier to access. Nunataks were first described in Greenland. Nunatak means \\"lonely peak\\" in Inuktitut. Due to their sterile surroundings and isolation, nunataks are rarely or never visited. The land area on and surrounding Mericle Rock is not cultivated. The vegetation natural to the area is mainly still intact. Mericle Rock is a Summit.

The party aims to produce a generational change in Vanuatu's leadership and is concerned about foreign ownership of businesses. Upon launching the party, Regenvanu‚Äìa popular, young and independent Member of Parliament‚Äìreportedly described chiefs, churches, women and youth as the four solid legs of the party. He also stated that prospective GJP candidates for parliamentary election would be \\"severely tested on their record of community service\\", to ensure that all GJP MPs were committed to defending the public interest. Subsequently, Regenvanu said his party advocated against people selling their land to investors and thereby depriving their children and descendants of that asset. It also supported a greater use of the customary judicial system, where chiefs act as mediators, rather than the \\"Western\\" system, which Regenvanu said often implied significant financial costs for litigants.

Ray Lilly, the series' first person narrator, and protagonist recounts his adventures working for the Twenty Palace Society. The novels have taken place in rural areas in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, as well as Los Angeles.  Premise  Magic is real, along with supernatural creatures such as demons, spirits, and werewolves. Ray Lilly works for a mysterious organization of sorcerers known as the Twenty Palace Society. Their aim appears to be using any means necessary to keep magic out of the hands of anyone other than their own members. Their primary concern is with spell books, which are the source of magic, and with preventing magic users from summoning creatures known as predators from an otherworldly dimension known as the Empty Places.  Works in the series =Twenty Palaces= A prequel to Child of Fire. =Child of Fire= Ray Lilly is the wooden man (a decoy expected to die to allow a sorceress to deal with a predator or enemy sorcerer) and driver of Annalise Powliss, and is under a standing death mark from the Twenty Palace Society. Driving her to Hammer Bay, Washington, Ray helps Annalise uncover a sorcerer, the CEO of Hammer Bay Toys, and his enslaved predator, a Wheel of Fire, that allows Hammer to influence the future. The Wheel is slowly eroding its bindings, enough so that it begins to kill the children of Hammer Bay, using their bodies to build an offspring. Ray eventually kills Hammer and isolates the Wheel. Annalise is horribly wounded during this fight, and Ray manages to resurrect her by force feeding her meat. =Game of Cages= Ray, detached from Annalise and with new knowledge of several of the spells put upon his body prior to Child of Fire by Annalise, is paired with Catherine Little, an investigator of the Society. Sent to investigate rumors of a predator being sold at auction, Ray and Catherine arrive too late to interrupt the sale, and that the sapphire dog, a predator that feeds by forcing victims to kill one another, has escaped. Ray eventually overpowers two other sorcerers who arrive to contest for the dog, and kills the predator itself, again saving Annalise's life, who arrives after the presence of the predator is confirmed. =Circle of Enemies= Ray is contacted by former associates in Los Angeles, and discovers all of his friends have been infected with predators to render them invisible. Ray's old nemesis inscribed them the spells to protect them from the predators in henna, which gradually fades, resulting in Ray's friends eventually being devoured. Again working for Annalise, Ray eventually finds the home of a traitor to the Society, and finds the Book of Oceans hidden in the home. Ray reads the Book of Oceans but refuses the gift of magical power. At the end of the book, after killing his nemesis, Ray is invited to the First Palace along with Annalise, as Ray is one of the few people, including the peers, who has actually managed to secure any recent victories. =\\"The Home Made Mask\\"= A novelette contained in the collection Bad Little Girls Die Horrible Deaths and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy. =The Twisted Path= An ebook novella. Ray Lilly has been summoned to the headquarters of the Twenty Palace Society to answer one question: How has he managed to survive mission after mission fighting alongside his boss, Annalise? He doesn't have the power of a full peer of the society. He's a wooden man. An assistant. A diversion. The other peers want to know what's going on, so it's off to Europe for a trip to the First Palace. And no place in the world is safer than inside the headquarters of the Twenty Palace Society, right?  Characters  * Ray Lilly is an ex-con who works as a driver and \\"wooden man\\" for the Society. His job is to distract enemies so that sorcerers can carry out their duties. Ray's only spells are a \\"ghost knife,\\" a small piece of paper covered in packing tape and laminated, and magical tattoos drawn on him by Annalise. The ghost knife can cut \\"ghosts, magic, and dead things\\", and when it passes through a person it saps their will. The tattoos covering Ray's torso and arms protect him from most physical harm and some spells, cause him to be forgotten by people he encounters, and may have other properties about which Ray is not yet aware. During 'Circle of Enemies' Annalise convinces a peer to give Ray the golem flesh spell, which renders Ray impervious to most injuries provided he eats red meat, which he must now do on a daily basis or begin to die. This also means Ray could live up to 500 years or longer. Ray has also read The Book of Oceans, and while he refused the infusion of knowledge that would've rendered him a primary, it is unclear if this has had any effect on him. * Annalise Powliss is a peer with the Twenty Palace Society, and the usual person to whom Ray answers directly. She has super-strength and invulnerability, as well as the ability to heal from extensive wounds, and carries disposable ribbons that summon \\"spirit fire\\". Although she appears to be around twenty years old, she is at least 90 to 100 years older, and has dealt with extremely famous cases, including the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run, meaning she has been active since at least the 1930s. * Catherine Little is an investigator for the Society. She has no magical powers, and is solely responsible for finding indications of possible predator or magical activity and report in to the Society.  Magic  Magic is almost entirely dependent on rituals or artifacts created by rituals. These can take many forms, and can be performed by anyone with the proper spell form and artifact, though most spells cause incredible pain for the caster during the casting, and are treated like part of the sorcerer who casts them. Ray refuses to loan his ghost knife to an investigator, telling her \\"you might as well ask me for my thumb.\\" Spells are granted in visions to people who possess one of the three true tomes of magic, becoming \\"primaries.\\" As spells or artifacts are then passed from hand to hand, they grow weaker, meaning the same spell performed by a primary is more powerful than the same performed by his apprentice, a secondary. Spells are also known to appear on their own in established spell books. = Spells = * Closed Way: Provides impenetrability on the covered area, and is one of the more common tattoos - Ray and Annalise both have multiple copies of this spell laid upon them (Annalise by an unknown superior, likely her master, and Ray by Annalise). However, for spellcasters who are weaker than primaries, the tattoo becomes visible (allowing knowledgeable individuals to target exposed areas), and the area becomes less and less sensitive, until it becomes completely numb (Ray has often looked down to realize he's been shot but didn't feel anything because the tattoo blocked it). However, the tattoo isn't an absolute protection; \\"Tattoo,\\" an infamous enemy of the society, was almost completely covered in them, but was ultimately wounded by the blast from a backfire of his pistol, allowing Ray to finish him off magically. * The Twisted Path: Appearing as a tattoo on an individual, this spell allows many beneficial effects for a criminal or outlaw. One \\"on the twisted path\\" leaves no accurate forensic evidence. Fingerprints won't match, DNA won't come back to you, and witnesses may even identify someone else in a lineup. Ray's spell (placed by Annalise) is apparently powerful enough to subvert digital photography. It's unclear when exactly Annalise cast this on Ray; a knowledgeable individual pointed it out in Game of Cages, but given that he wasn't picked up after Hammer Bay, it stands to reason that Annalise cast it prior to Child of Fire. * Golem Flesh: Golem Flesh provides an added degree of protection from damage; however, more importantly, it also provides a healing factor that allows for the bearer of the spell to regenerate damage rapidly, provided that they take in fresh meat. However, as a trade-off, the spell requires the consumption of red meat daily, and it is best if the meat is fresh and uncooked, which is disgusting to new recipients of the spell, and takes time to get used to. Until such damage is healed, however, the body of a golem flesh recipient is able to survive long periods of time with horrific injuries - Ansel Zahn survived having part of him sucked into another dimension, and Annalise was able to be revived after being burnt to a husk after the source of the timebending magic was cut off by Ray. Human flesh works well - both Zahn and Wally King are able to consume human flesh to heal damage. In addition, should one consume meat properly on a regular basis, the spell can artificially extend one's natural lifetime - the traditional expectation is often put at \\"five hundred years,\\" but no one knows exactly how long it would last. The spell takes the form of a tattoo that has some form of spirals and apparently bears resemblance to something, though Ray decides to look away rather than study the spell. Although the spell appears in many spellbooks, this one is only cast on rare circumstances - for it to be effective, a caster has to be exceptionally powerful, and it seems to take something out of said casters, as well. Combined with the risks inherent in creating a powerful, long-living individual, the Society reserves casting of the spell to special circumstances. * The Iron Gate: Protects one from mental influence both from spells and predators. The spell throbs or even screams with unbearable agony depending upon the severity of the invasion, providing both a warning and something to focus upon to resist the intrusion. Ray's spell is apparently powerful enough to aid him against any predator so far seen, and against any spell seen provided he is aware of said spell from the throbbing. He even resists a spell cast on an object to protect its contents cast by a powerful sorcerer, which makes most individuals look away. In Ray's case, his spell is located below his right collarbone. * Ghost Knife/Soul Knife: Cast by Ray onto a piece of paper from the book he stole and apparently keeps hidden somewhere. Can be telekinetically controlled. Cuts all non living matter, all magic, and \\"ghosts\\" or souls. Use on humans renders them docile and compliant, even apologetic for past aggression. Use on a non aggressive suspect highly magnifies the effect, enough so to make Ray incredibly disgusted with himself in Child of Fire. Seen in Game of Cages cast upon a silver Chinese jian in the possession of a rich businessman. Effects are similar, perhaps even magnified. Annalise's green ribbons: Causes a massive explosion of green fire that Rays iron gate protects him from Circle of Enemies. Annalise's favored weapon. Kills predators with ease. Annalise's white ribbons: Knocks a person out who views the sigil. Various and sundry summoning spells.  Predators  * Cousins: Balls of light that grant health and super-human abilities to their host (e.g., strength, speed, etc.). The predator eats away the brain of the host, but retains the host's personality and memories. These predators appear in the novel Twenty Palaces, the prequel to the trilogy of the same name. * Wheels of Fire: Fiery wheels made of \\"grey worms\\" that exist outside linear time. Proper manipulation of this creature is what allows the Hammers their abilities in Child of Fire. * Werewolves: Spell cast upon the family police force of Hammer Bay by the Hammers. Allows transformation into a wolf. Effects behavior causing pack mentality and over aggression as well as moral disassociation. * Ball Lightning or \\"floating storm\\": Ball of sentient, electricity hungry lightning. Summoned by Zahn with a magical lightning rod. Shown to be summoned without a circle by killing a person with the rod. Game of Cages. * Sapphire Dog: This creature has a magical gift for compulsion. To see it is to love it. Can also pass through solid matter. Seen in Game of Cages, and possibly inside the person of Wally King in Circle of Enemies (this is probably what gave him the ability to walk through walls) * Iron Balls: Golf ball sized iron balls filled with fire that are simply immovable. Think Blob from X-Men. Killed easily with the ghost knife they explode into flame, often killing their fellows. Can bestow the gift of total immovability upon a person they inhabit physically. Seen to inhabit wally king in untold numbers. * Winds of Air and Hunger or \\"drapes\\": Invisible creatures that are sort of like boa constrictors if boa constrictors could totally envelope a person. Attempts to crawl in sinus cavities (nose, mouth, ears). Seen inhabiting multiple people whom they bestow invisibility on. After the person they inhabit dies they open a hole in the ground to the Deeps where upon they summon exponential numbers of their brethren. Exact curve unknown. First summon in COE brings 2, 2nd brings 3, 3rd brings 4, but after 5 the progression is described as a \\"swarm\\". * Claws in Darkness: Eagle like talons that come out of voids of darkness. According to Annalise a popular form of guardian for summoners. Fairly resistant to the ghost knife but fall easily to Annalise's green ribbons.  Publishing history  The Twenty Palaces books are published by Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books owned by Random House. The first volume, Child of Fire, was released in 2009 in paperback; the next novel in the series, Game of Cages was released in 2010, also in paperback. The third novel, Circle of Enemies was released in 2011. The covers are painted by Christian McGrath, who also does covers for The Dresden Files series. In October 2011, Harry Connolly announced that the series was cancelled due to poor sales.http://www.harryjconnolly.com/blog/?p=5488 In November 2011, Harry Connolly self-published a prequel to the Twenty Palaces series,http://www.harryjconnolly.com/blog/?p=5696 appropriately enough titled Twenty Palaces. This book is available from his website, Amazon.com, and Barnes & Noble. =Reception= Both Child of Fire and Game of Cages have garnered generally positive reviews, and Connolly summarizes and links to both positive and negative reviews at his blog, Twenty Palaces. Child of Fire received a starred review from Publishers Weekly and was subsequently named to their top 100 books of 2009 list.http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20091102/26073-best-books- of-2009.html/ Game of Cages received a starred review as well, and though it did not make the 2010 list, it was named as one of four honorable mentions by the Publishers Weekly sci-fi/fantasy/horror reviews editor. The books are often compared to The Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher, but there are several differences, including the fact that the Twenty Palaces books do not take place in a city. Critics of the novels are generally concerned by the fact that not enough information has been given about the Twenty Palace Society and the way magic works in that universe.

Version 2.0 of the protocol, known as \\"SIP2\\", is a de facto standard for library self-service applications. History SIP version 1.0 was published by 3M in 1993. The first version of the protocol supported basic check in and check out operations, but had minimal support for more advanced operations. Version 2.0 of the protocol was published in 2006 and added support for flexible, more user-friendly notifications, and for the automated processing of payments for late fees. SIP2 was widely adopted by library automation vendors, including ODILO, Bibliotheca, Nedap, Checkpoint, Envisionware, FE Technologies and open source integrated library system software such as Koha and Evergreen. The standard was the basis for the NISO Circulation Interchange Protocol (NCIP) standard which is eventually intended to replace it. Description SIP is a simple protocol in which requests to perform operations are sent over a connection, and responses are sent in return. The protocol explicitly does not define how a connection between the two devices is established; it is limited to specifying the format of the messages sent over the connection. There are no \\"trial\\" transactions; each operation will be attempted immediately and will either be permitted or not. The protocol specifies messages to check books in and out, to manage fee payments, to request holds and renewals, and to carry out the other basic circulation operations of a library.  Encryption and Authentication  SIP has no built in encryption, so steps need to be taken to send the connection through some sort of encrypted tunnel.

Background In 1918, Spracklin took up the pastoral charge of Sandwich Methodist Church,Subsequently Sandwich United Church, and afterwards Bedford United Church http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place- lieu.aspx?id=10783 Windsor. He was noted for the eloquence of his rhetorical style. Spracklin's ministry occurred during a period when Prohibition ‚Äî which was especially promoted by the United Farmers of Ontario' Provincial Government ‚Äî was regarded as a pressing issue by Spracklin and many of his parishioners and supporters. =Dubious supporters= These supporters included the brothers W. H. and S. M. Hallam, who, in the Windsor area, were known less for their religious observance than for their muscular activities in support of questionable causes.Chad Fraser, 'Lake Erie stories: struggle and survival on a freshwater ocean', p. 186 The Hallams thus joined Spracklin in Ontario Attorney-General William Raney's Prohibition enforcement team, as part of the Attorney-General's policy of bypassing the regular police forces in favour of using sub-contracted, private groups of enforcers.'Finding the ordinary police forces insufficient, he [Raney] organized a corps of his own.' Robert Bothwell, 'A Short History of Ontario', Edmonton: Hurtig Publishers, Ltd., 1986, p. 126 This varied component recruited by Spracklin was subsequently to cause William Raney considerable embarrassment. Geographical context of the Detroit River to Spracklin's ministry The proximity of the United States' border to the Sandwich suburb of Windsor, Ontario, where Spracklin fulfilled his ministry, and the huge cross-border trade - legal and illicit - gave heightened focus to the concerns and activities of Spracklin and his zealous followers. This proximity undoubtedly bore relevance also to Spracklin's eventual emigration. Prohibition controversies and events of 1920 On August 26, 1920, the cruiser Eugenia, was stopped in the Detroit River after the speedboat Panther II, with Spracklin and his associate W. H. Hallam on board, fired on the cruiser; nine men were arrested and accused of attempting to smuggle whiskey into the US.Chad Fraser, 'Lake Erie stories: struggle and survival on a freshwater ocean', p. 187 It was reported also on August 27, 1920 that Spracklin had accused the mayor of Amherstburg, W. Fred Park, of harbouring large quantities of alcohol; Mayor Park was subsequently fined $1000.00. =Ministerial benevolence doubted= It was claimed that the pastor was not distinguishing between his spiritual and alcohol inspection duties. Complaints abounded. To skeptics, his enforcers seemed not to act with adequate restraint or oversight. A Windsor, Ontario lawyer claimed that Spracklin's men, allegedly exceeding their proper duty, would arbitrarily fill in blank search warrants at will. Distrusts among even his own parishioners It was also claimed that Spracklin showed excessive zeal, and that this demonstration of zeal extended to his treatment of his own parishioners. The attention of these Spracklin would engage while preaching in the interior of Sandwich Methodist Church; meanwhile, in the parking area outside the building, his uninhibited enforcement associates would surreptitiously search his parishioners' cars at random. =Pastor's wife escapes spray of bullets= On Halloween night, 1920, Spracklin's wife Myrle Welsh narrowly escaped death when the Spracklins' manse was sprayed with bullets from an unproven source. At the time it was assumed that this violent incident was perpetrated on the behalf of persons in the illicit liquor trade disadvantaged by Spracklin and his men; this assumption was never seriously questioned.Chad Fraser, 'Lake Erie stories: struggle and survival on a freshwater ocean', pp. 187-188 It subsequently proved to be pivotal but somewhat obscure to establish whether this traumatic event led to later actions on the part of her husband. =Manslaughter charge and trial= On November 6, 1920, Spracklin, as part of Ontario Attorney-General Raney's Prohibition enforcement team, shot and killed Beverly Trumble, proprietor of the Chappell House hotel, who was engaged in illicit trade in liquor, City Council Minutes, September 5, 2006, City of Windsor, p. 27 and in whose hand Spracklin later claimed to have seen a gun. However, any direct linkage between the occurrence of this violent death only a few days after Myrle's alarming experience on Halloween Night remained unclear. Acquittal At his subsequent trial, Spracklin was acquitted of manslaughter. The transparency of the process by which Spracklin's acquittal emerged was evidently called into question by some, since this verdict was met with considerable surprise in some quarters. =Widespread comment evoked by Spracklin's fate= Much discussion and comment ensued following Spracklin's trial and acquittal. The fact that historical records of Spracklin's actions on November 6, 1920 differ in emphasis underlines the controversy which arose from the series of events leading to his acquittal. =Varying opinions asserted= The tenor of one historical account is suggestive that Spracklin should have been charged with murder rather than of the manslaughter of which he was eventually acquitted.Robert Bothwell, 'A Short History of Ontario', Edmonton: Hurtig Publishers, Ltd., 1986, p. 126 Other descriptions seek to stress that the evidence should be interpreted as indicating that Spracklin acted in self-defence. Later life A more distant relationship between Spracklin and the Hallams emerged. In 1921 Spracklin relinquished his pastoral charge at Sandwich Methodist Church. Spracklin's resignation appears to have occurred without another parish charge having been made available to him, and with the events surrounding his manslaughter charge and acquittal very much in memory. Following Spracklin's resignation, the nature of his pastoral work underwent changes. =Development of itinerant ministry and emigration= The ministerial vocation of Spracklin thus evidenced significant development in its emphasis into itinerant activities in place of localized, parish ministry. Spracklin later emigrated to the United States, and there he continued with his personal mission of campaigning for the anti-liquor cause. =Promotion of Anti-Saloon League in the US= In the US, Spracklin's ministry involved significant travel. His efforts were considerably directed towards the promotion of the Anti-Saloon League. Spracklin thus itinerated as a visiting speaker to local churches on the League's behalf.J. H. James, 'Church Calendar', in: 'Cass City Chronicle', January 16, 1931, p. 4 Legacy By general consent, the conjunction of events around the Canadian period of Spracklin's ministry related to the particularly excessive zeal of the Prohibition era in Ontario, when the ideas and aims of the soon to be eclipsed United Farmers of Ontario were prominent. Spracklin's vigorously vocal ministry at least superficially resembles that of J. Frank Norris, of Fort Worth, Tx, who also maintained an itinerant pastoral charge in Detroit, Michigan. Like Spracklin, Norris also widely employed his considerable, rhetorical gifts in anti-liquor campaigning in opposition to local civic leaders and was himself acquitted of murdering an associate of the local mayor in 1926 on grounds of self-defence, which were later widely challenged. Norris, whose vigorous political views exercised a deep influence upon his seminary student John Birch and others, later undertook a wide, public ministry; however, the reputation of Spracklin never eclipsed the events of 1920.

Slide positions above the score indicate the large and swift change from the first to higher and then the highest positions required. In music, an instrumental idiom refers to writing, parts, and performance, those being idiomatic or nonidiomatic depending on how well each is suited to the specific instrument intended, in terms of both ease of playing and quality of music and the inherent tendencies and limitations of specific instruments. The analogy is with linguistic idiomaticness, that is, form or structure peculiar to one language but not another. For example, the trombone is played with a slide, making it one of the few wind instruments capable of glissando or sliding. However, pitches are different harmonics from the harmonic series on different slide positions. Thus, in the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes to be played in alternate positions. As an example, F4 (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a standard B trombone. There are cross-instrument guidelines. For example, it is difficult to begin playing very quietly in the upper or lower range of some instruments, (it taking more energy to produce sound) with tone quality and/or intonation often suffering. Use of extended techniques and writing in or beyond the highest or lowest range is not recommended, especially for student ensembles, unless writing for a specific performer.  Idiomatic compositional constraints  There are a few notable examples of idiomatic instrumental constraints affecting compositional choices found written music. For example, in the final movement of Ravel's Piano Concerto in G Major, the final note played in the bass voice of the piano sounds an A0, rather than what would be the tonic G0. This is most likely due to the piano's lowest note being A0 rather than G0, which does not exist on a standard piano. Ravel also makes a similar choice in a climactic moment in Jeux d'eau, ending a falling gesture again on A0, rather than G#0 due to the limitations of the instrument. Ravel also employs using A0 to begin the third presentation of the rising motive in the opening of the third movement Gaspard de la nuit when the motive is played down the octave. The ending of Bax's 4th Piano Sonata written in the key of G major also ends with a low A0 in the bass voice. In the Finale to Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, the violins begin the initial melody, though do not complete the melody when it descends to the low E, which is sounded by the violas. A similar continuation of the melody by the violas due to the limitations of the violin's range occurs in the final movement of Saint-Sa√´ns' 3rd violin concerto.

It was built between 1881 and 1884 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Li√®ge. Attacked in both World War I and World War II, the fort has been preserved as a museum. Description The Fort de Fl√©malle is located about southwest of the center of Li√®ge. Fl√©malle overlooks the Meuse valley upstream from Li√®ge. The fort was built as an irregular trapezoid, almost triangular. A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. The fort is one of the larger Li√®ge forts. With the exception of the Fort de Loncin, the Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Li√®ge), with lesser protection than the two \\"salient\\" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear.Donnell, p. 36 The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21 cm.Donnell, p. 52 The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used .Donnell, p. 12 Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21 cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.Donnell, pp. 45-48 Armament Fl√©malle's armament included two turrets with a single 21 cm Krupp gun, a15cm turret with twin guns and two 12 cm turret with two Krupp guns, all for distant targets. Four 57 mm gun turrets were provided for local defense. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight. Eleven rapid-fire 57 mm guns were provided in casemates for the defense of the ditches and the postern. The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with the neighboring Fort de Loncin and Fort de Liers. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.Donnell, p. 17 First World War The Li√®ge forts In 1914 Fl√©malle was commanded by Captain-Commandant Falize with five officers and 150 men. Li√®ge first came under attack on 6 August 1914. When the Li√®ge's fortifications proved unexpectedly stubborn, the Germans brought heavy siege artillery to bombard the forts with shells far larger than they were designed to resist. Fl√©malle was one of the last forts to come under heavy bombardment, and was the last of the Liƒóge forts to surrender. Following the explosion of the Fort de Loncin, the Germans sent delegations to the last two holdouts, Fl√©malle and the Fort de Hollogne, emphasisizing the consequences of continued resistance. Fl√©malle surrendered at 0930 on 16 August, two hours after Hollogne.Donnell, p. 51 Fortified Position of Li√®ge Fl√©malles armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Li√®ge II, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border.Donnell, pp. 55-56 The armament was upgraded with new guns in the turrets and an anti-aircraft battery. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. Armament included a machine gun turret, a twin 105mm gun turret, a turret with a single 150mm gun, and four single 75mm guns in retractable turrets. The 57mm guns were replaced with machine guns. Six anti-aircraft guns were also provided. Second World War In 1940 Fl√©malle was commanded by Captain-Commandant Barbieux, with five officers and about 150 men. Following the successful German assault on Fort Eben-Emael to the east, Fl√©malle provided fire support for Belgian field units for the next few days. On 15 May the fort came under aerial bombing attack, destroying the gun turrets. The next day German ground forces attacked. Unable to mount an effective resistance, the fort surrendered. Present Fl√©malle was partly stripped of its equipment during the German occupation, and again by a salvager in the 1960s. The fort has been maintained by a preservation association since 1992, which has established a museum in the fort.

There have been several schools in the history of modern chess. Today there is less dependence on schools ‚Äì players draw on many sources and play according to their personal style. Philidor Philidor In 1749, Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor published Analyse du jeu des √âchecs. This was the first book to discuss the strategy of chess in the whole in detail. It was also the first to discuss the interplay of and pawns in the game. Philidor believed that maintaining the of pawns was the most important strategic factor of chess, and he discussed pawn structure, particularly isolated pawns, doubled pawns, and backward pawns. Philidor's writings were widely praised and misunderstood for 90 years. His ideas were taken up by the English school in the 1840s. In 1925, Aron Nimzowitsch recognized the importance of pawn mobility. Philidor has increasingly been recognized as the founder of modern chess strategy . Modenese school The Modenese school is due to three 18th-century players known as the Modenese Masters: Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani, Giambattista Lolli, and Ercole del Rio. They recommended playing the Italian Game opening. In contrast to Philidor's idea of pawn structure and mobility, the Modenese school emphasized rapid of the pieces for an attack on the opposing king from the get go, aiming for checkmate or a material advantage in the process, often at the expense of pawn efficiency or even whole pawns. This style of play was employed by Gioachino Greco, Alessandro Salvio, and other Italian players of the 16th century . English school Staunton The English school was founded by Howard Staunton in the 1840s. His followers included Bernhard Horwitz, Elijah Williams, Marmaduke Wyvill, and to some degree Adolf Anderssen and Daniel Harrwitz. In this style, there was no quick attack on the opposing king. Instead, the attacks were prepared, as strategic advantages ‚Äì such as control over the center and key points ‚Äì were first obtained. Pieces were developed behind pawns to support their advance. Staunton pioneered the use of flank openings and the fianchettoing of the bishop. After Staunton practically retired in 1853, these ideas were mostly neglected. Romantic chess Anderssen Romantic chess was the style of chess prevalent in the 19th century. It was characterized by brash sacrifices and open, tactical games. Winning was secondary to winning with style ‚Äì so much, in fact, that it was considered unsportsmanly to decline a gambit (the sacrifice of a pawn or piece to obtain an attack). It is no coincidence that the most popular openings played by the Romantics were King's Gambit Accepted and the Evans Gambit Accepted. Some of the major players of the Romantic era were Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Henry Blackburne. A famous game of this time is the Immortal Game between Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky, which embodies the Romantic style. The style was effectively ended on the highest level by Wilhelm Steinitz, who, with his more positional approach, crushed all of his contemporaries and ushered in the modern age of chess. Classical school Steinitz Around 1860, Louis Paulsen realized that many attacks on the king succeeded because of poor defense. Wilhelm Steinitz agreed with that and rejected the prevailing notion that attack was more honorable than defense. Steinitz, who had engaged in the mid-century Romantic style of play in his youth, began to change his focus to building a strong pawn structure and seeing small advantages to capitalize on rather than sweeping assaults against the enemy king. Positional play was not a new idea and there are many examples of such games from the Romantic era, however it did not become popular or widely accepted until Steinitz won the 1873 Vienna Tournament with his ideas of defense-based chess. He is considered the first true chess world champion, and remained so for 21 years despite not playing actively for almost 15 of them. In addition, he became the first chess master to make a living exclusively from professional chess, while most players up to this time played the game merely as a hobby or way to earn extra money while having other professions as their main occupation. Steinitz's ideas were controversial and widely criticized‚Äîsome older players such as Adolf Anderssen never fully accepted them. He wrote numerous articles in chess publications defending his ideas, but by the 1890s they were embraced by a new generation of young players such as Siegbert Tarrasch and Emanuel Lasker. These players also took Steinitz's ideas and improved and made them more rational and accessible. In 1894, the torch was effectively passed to Steinitz's pupils when he was defeated by Lasker for the world championship. As a result of the classical school, many of the chess openings which had been hallmarks of Romantic chess such as the King's Gambit and Philidor's Defense fell out of use among elite players, while the Queen's Gambit, previously rare, became a staple of high-level chess. By the opening years of the 20th century, chess masters outside of Europe began to appear (previously, Paul Morphy had been the only notable non-European player). These included the Americans Harry Nelson Pillsbury and Frank Marshall, and later the Cuban Jose Raul Capablanca. Emanuel Lasker held onto the world championship a record 27 years, although he did not play chess for long periods of time owing to his career as a mathematics professor. Hypermodern school Nimzowitsch The hypermodern school was founded by Aron Nimzowitsch, Richard R√©ti, Savielly Tartakower, Gyula Breyer, and Ernst Gr√ºnfeld in the 1920s . The hypermodernists rejected the idea that occupation of the center was important. Instead, the hypermodern school emphasizes control of the center by attacking it with pieces ‚Äì especially from the periphery. The hypermodern school also denied the superiority of the in all types of positions and claimed that the bishop pair was only strong in open or semi-open positions Aron Nimzowitsch, My System . While e4 openings and tactical play were still common during the classical era, the post-WWI period saw a significant shift as e4 openings of any kind became unfashionable outside the amateur level. Richard Reti went so far as to pronounce e4 \\"a decisive mistake\\" and argued that d4 was the only rational way to open a game, while the Sicilian and French Defense were the only rational responses to 1. e4. Players such as Frank Marshall and Jose Raul Capablanca (who took the world championship from Lasker in 1921), formerly known as tactical players and users of e4 openings, began switching their repertoires to queen side pawn openings and a more positional style of play in the 1920s. In 1927, Alexander Alekhine challenged Capablanca for the world championship. The match, lasting 34 games, was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina and achieved infamy for its overuse of the Orthodox Defense of the Queen's Gambit Declined, which was used in all but two games (the remaining two featured a French Defense and Queen's Indian Defense). Alekhine defeated Capablanca to become the fourth world chess champion, which he retained until his death in 1946 (aside from two years where he lost the title to Max Euwe). The excessive use of the Queen's Gambit Declined Orthodox Defense in the 1927 championship match brought about an increased acceptance of hypermodern openings, which began to become a staple of competitive chess during the 1930s. In addition, elite players began to explore the Slav Defense and other QGD variants. Soviet hegemony Chigorin In the 1940s the Soviet Union began a long domination of chess. The Soviet school agreed with Tarrasch and emphasized mobility. A weakness that could not be attacked was not a real weakness. The Soviet school was based on the teachings of Mikhail Chigorin (1850‚Äì1908). Mikhail Botvinnik was the first truly dominant Soviet grandmaster, having been groomed for the role due to his youth and loyalty to communism. In 1937, he won the USSR Championship, but the world championship had to wait for over a decade until after WWII had ended and current champion Alexander Alekhine had died in 1946, leaving the championship vacant. Botvinnik became world champion by winning a tournament of five top players, the World Chess Championship 1948. After WWII, hypermodern openings such as the Indian Defenses became a staple of high-level chess and have remained so ever since. In addition, the period saw a meteoric rise of the Sicilian Defense, which had been written about since the 16th century, but was uncommon until the 1950s.

There is evidence for the lateralization of other brain functions as well. Emotions are complex and involve a variety of physical and cognitive responses, many of which are not well understood. The general purpose of emotions is to produce a specific response to a stimulus. Feelings are the conscious perception of emotions, and when an emotion occurs frequently or continuously this is called a mood. A variety of scientific studies have found lateralization of emotions. FMRI and lesion studies have shown asymmetrical activation of brain regions while thinking of emotions, responding to extreme emotional stimuli, and viewing emotional situations. Processing and production of facial expressions also appear to be asymmetric in nature. Many theories of lateralization have been proposed and some of those specific to emotions. Please keep in mind that most of the information in this article is theoretical and scientists are still trying to understand emotion and emotional lateralization. Also, some of the evidence is contradictory. Many brain regions are interconnected and the input and output of any given region may come from and go to many different regions.  Theories of lateralization =Right hemisphere dominance= Some variations of right hemisphere dominance are... a) The right hemisphere has more control over emotion than left hemisphere.Lane, p. 79-80. b) The right hemisphere is dominant in emotional expression in a similar way that the left hemisphere is dominant in language. c) The right hemisphere is dominant in the perception of facial expression, body posture, and prosody. d) The right hemisphere is important for processing primary emotions such as fear while the left hemisphere is important for preprocessing social emotions. Lane, p. 332. General lesions in the right hemisphere reduce or eliminate electrodermal response (skin conductance response ((SCR)) to emotionally meaningful stimuli while the lesions in the left hemisphere do not show changes in SCR response.Lane, p. 192. Subject SB-2046 had part of his right, prefrontal lobe removed because of cancer. While his IQ and a majority of other normal functions were unharmed, he had severely impaired decision-making skills especially when he had to consider immediate vs. future reward and punishment. His decisions were almost always guided by immediate reward or punishment and disregarded any long-term consequences. Researchers were incapable of conditioning patient SB-2046 to nonverbal stimuli containing emotional meaning (reward or punishment), but were able to condition the patient to verbal stimuli containing emotional meaning. Most language production and processing occur in the left hemisphere while the majority of the emotional processing and production of emotion in speech occurs in the right hemisphere. Persons with schizophrenia usually have difficulty processing prosody. These patients also show a remarkable increase in lateralization towards the right hemisphere of both emotionally and non- emotional prosody rich speech.Bach, D.R., et al. Altered lateralisation of emotional prosody processing in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia Research. 110: 180‚Äì187, 2009. Also, a decrease in right-handedness led to an increase in the right hemisphere lateralization. This right hemisphere lateralization extends beyond prosody to many of aspects of language and speech processing in schizophrenic patients. =Complementarity specialization= The two hemispheres have a complementary specialization for control of different aspects of emotion. a) Left hemisphere primarily process \\"positive\\" emotions and right hemisphere primarily process \\"negative\\" emotions. A large portion of regions primarily in the right hemisphere are activated during aversive classical conditioning.Lane, p. 233-237. ::While this theory seems to hold true for some emotions, this theory is generally considered outdated; however a few examples exist. For example, a study found that when subjects were primed with positive stimuli before hearing a consonant, the left hemisphere was more active than the right hemisphere.Alfano, K.M., and C.R. Cimino. Alteration of expected hemispheric asymmetries: Valence and arousal effects in neuropsychological models of emotion. Brain and Cognition. 66: 213‚Äì220, 2008. In contrast, when subjects were primed with a negative stimulus, the right hemisphere was more active than the left hemisphere. b) Other divisions of specialization ::The amygdala plays a role in the conscious awareness of emotion (feelings) resulting in perception of feeling, but experiments suggest the left and right amygdala have distinct roles in conscious and unconscious processing of emotion. The right amygdala plays a role in the nonconscious processing of emotion while the left amygdala was involved in the processing of conscious emotions.Lane, p. 321. These results were obtained from studies that masked conditioning stimuli. Stimuli were presented over a very short period of time such that subjects were not consciously aware of the stimuli but were still able to show physiological changes. ::Damage to the left hemisphere in patients results in a marked increase in depression.Lane, p. 334-339. Valence asymmetry may be due to more cholinergic and dopaminergic on the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere being more noradrenergic. Patients with right hemisphere damage had reduced arousal response to painful stimuli. =Homeostatic basis= Neuroanatomical basis for emotional lateralization This model provides a neuroanatomical basis for emotional control and processing. The peripheral autonomic nervous system is not symmetrical. Afferent nerves in the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems of the autonomic nervous system differently innervate various organs that maintain homeostasis such as the heart and the face.Craig, A.D. Forebrain emotional asymmetry: a neuroanatomical basis? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9 (12): 566-571, 2005 The asymmetrical representation of the autonomic peripheral nervous system leads to the asymmetrical representation in the brain.Conesa, J. Electrodermal palmar asymmetry and nostril dominance. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 80: 211-216, 1995 The left hemisphere is activated predominantly by homeostatic afferents associated with parasympathetic functions and the right hemisphere is activated predominantly by homeostatic afferents associated with sympathetic functions. The lateralization is extremely apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex (AI) associated with higher emotions such as romantic love and motivation correlated with homeostatic functions. The left AI and ACC are more active during feelings of romantic love and maternal attachment. The AI and ACC were activated on both the right and left sides while watching pain being inflicted on a loved one while only the right AI and ACC that is elicited during subjective feelings of pain; this supports the association of right AI in aroused (‚Äòsympathetic‚Äô) feelings and left AI in affiliative (‚Äòparasympathetic‚Äô) feelings. Particularly, cardiovascular function appears to be lateralized and tied to emotional stress. Intense emotional stimuli that cause stress can lead to alterations in cardiovascular function.O, Ozcan, and V. Hachinski. Brain lateralization and sudden death: Its role in the neurogenic heart syndrome. Journal of the Neurological Sciences. 268: 6-11, 2008. The right insular cortex probably plays the most significant role in these phenomena. Similar lateralization is probably involved in cardiovascular malfunction in patients with head injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, meningitis and encephalitis, migraine, cluster headache and neurosurgical procedures. =Lateralization due to lateralization of other functions= \\"It is unlikely that the brain evolved an asymmetrical control of emotional behavior. Rather, it seems more likely that although there may be some asymmetry in the neural control of emotion, the observed asymmetries are largely a product of the asymmetrical control of other functions such as the control of movement, language, or the processing of complex sensory information,\\" Lateralization may have been evolutionarily adaptive.Vallortigara, G, and LJ Rogers.Survival with an asymmetrical brain: Advantages and disadvantages of cerebral lateralization Behavioral and Brain Science 28: 575‚Äì633, 2005. Lateralization may allow for a greater variety of emotions. The left temporal cortex is involved in language processing while the right temporal cortex is involved in processing faces. This lateralization is also apparent when processing emotions. =Lateralization and sex differences= There may be a difference in cortical activation between men and women. Activity in the right hemisphere was greater in women when exposed to unpleasant images than men, though men showed more activation bilaterally while viewing pleasant pictures.Lane, p. 261. Another study found that women but not men, with women had greater activation of their right hemisphere while viewing unpleasant faces and left hemisphere activation while viewing pleasant faces.Rodway, P., L. Wright, and S. Hardie. The valence-specific laterality effect in free viewing conditions: The influence of sex, handedness, and response bias. Brain and Cognition. 53: 452‚Äì463, 2003. Yet, another study found contrasting sex difference while recording EEG waves in the parietal and frontal lobes. Negative pictures activated the left hemisphere in women more than in men, and the right hemisphere in men more than in women when shown unpleasant images.Gasbarri, A., et al. Sex-related hemispheric lateralization of electrical potentials evoked by arousing negative stimuli. Brain Research. 1138: 178-186, 2007. Evidence of lateralization The vast majority of the data comes from functional imaging, skin conductance response (SCR), standardized tests ranging from cognitive (e.g. IQ tests) to emotional intelligence, and subjective questionnaires such as those rating how fearful or happy faces look. All the tests have their strengths and weakness (see \\"Limitation of Studies\\" below). This section primarily focuses on results on the more subjective observations and results that have unknown neural basis or regions. =Behavioral differences and cortical activation= 70% of right handed patients show preference in viewing emotion expressed on the right side of the face (in the left field of view) according to studies using chimeric faces produced using right-right or left-left mirrored faces. The left side of the face seems more fluent in expressing emotions which means the right cortical hemisphere is more fluent in expressing emotions.Lane, p. 71-73. Handedness does not appear to affect the processing associated with viewing facial expressions. Situations that contradict moral teachings generally produce negative emotions. Watching people behave badly by breaking moral codes most significantly activates the right parahippocampal gyrus, the right medial frontal gyrus, and left amygdala.Carla, L.H., and S. Hamann. Neural correlates of regulating negative emotions related to moral violations. NeuroImage. 30: 313 ‚Äì 324, 2006. Watching emotionally negative situations most significantly activates the right amygdala. This study indicates that lateral processing of emotions extends beyond the basic emotions to higher cognitive responses. Depression or having previously been depressed probably is due to altered brain structure or alters brain structure. Patients who have been depressed or are depressed show more activation to negative stimuli in emotion.Atchley, R.A., S.S> Ilardi, and A. Enloe. Hemispheric asymmetry in the processing of emotional content in word meanings: The effect of current and past depression. Brain and Language. 84: 105‚Äì119, 2003 When negative stimuli were presented to patients' right hemispheres, the patients were significantly more accurate and quicker to respond to the stimuli. The data in this study shows that psychological disorders are correlated with increased lateralization. =Facial expressions of emotion= Patients with damage to their left amygdala lesions rated fearful faces less fearful than normal subjects. Similar findings showed that regional blood flow increased in response to fear faces while decreased to euphoric faces in the left amygdala. Chimpanzees, other primates, and humans produce asymmetrical facial expressions with greater expression on the left side of the face (right hemisphere of the brain).Fernandez-Carriba, S., A. Loeches, A. Morcillo, and W.D. Hopkins. Functional asymmetry of emotions in primates: new findings in chimpanzees. Brain Research Bulletin. 57: 561‚Äì564, 2002. Researchers also subjectively reported that the left side of the face was expressing more emotion using images of left-left chimeric faces. =Notable lateralized brain structures and regions= Emotion is processed in many different areas of the brain, and a specific emotion may be processed in multiple areas. Regions involved in emotional lateralization appear to follow the general conventions that describe the roles/functions of certain brain regions. Below are a few regions and structure involved in emotional processing that show functional lateralization. Frontal lobe Using a PET scan, researchers found that activity in the left medial and lateral prefrontal cortex was reciprocally associated with decrease activity in the amygdala. These findings imply that the prefrontal cortex modulates the amygdala activity. The left prefrontal cortex plays a role in approach behaviors (positively valenced emotions), while the amygdala plays a role in withdrawal behaviors (negatively valenced emotions).Lane, p. 383 The superior frontal gyrus is the most significantly activated region while processing sadness.Vytal, K., and S. Hamann. Neuroimaging Support for Discrete Neural Correlates of Basic Emotions: A Voxel-based Meta-analysis. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 22(12): 2864‚Äì2885, 2010. Patients with inferior frontal lobe damage produce less and less intense facial expression when presented with emotional stimuli, and they also have problems reading fear and disgust in other people. People with left inferior frontal lobe damage produced less facial expression and could not analyze emotional situations as well as those with right frontal lobe damage especially with fear and disgust. The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) plays an important role in anger while the right IFG plays a larger role in disgust. Patients with dorsolateral frontal cortex lesions have difficulty discerning propositional attitude. Patients with left lesions show further increased impairment. Parietal lobe Damage to the inferior parietal region including the anterior (supramarginal gyrus) and posterior (angular gyrus) regions resulted in reduced SCR. Damage to the right hemisphere in these regions resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in SCR while the damage to the left hemisphere of these regions did not (p > 0.05).Lane, p. 192-195. Temporal lobe The right superior temporal gyrus was the most significantly activated area during the processing happiness. The right superior temporal gyrus increasingly responds to an increasingly happy stimuli, while the left pulvinar increasingly responds to increasingly fearful stimuli. The right pulvinar is activated during aversive conditioning. Amygdala The amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing especially fear, and amygdala function appears to be emotionally lateralized. When people are shown fearful faces the left amygdala and left periamygdaloid cortex increase in activation. There also appears to be a greater increase in neural activity in the left amygdala corresponding to an increasingly fearful stimulus.Lane, p. 228-230 Recordings from single-unit electrodes in monkeys have shown similar activation in the left amygdala. A man with confined damage in the right amygdala could not produce a startle response.Lane, p. 117-120. The activity (measured by a PET scan) in the right amygdala correlated to the number of emotionally arousing film clips capable of being recalled in patients. Unilateral activation of the amygdala due to fearful stimuli may also produce unilateral activation of other regions. The right middle temporal gyrus, right brainstem, left hippocampus, right cerebellum, right fuisform gyrus, and left lingual gyrus were also activated during fearful stimuli. Activation of multiple brain regions both indicates that emotions are processed in many parts of the brain and that emotions are complex. The amygdala probably plays a role in the conscious processing of emotion. The left amygdala was activated during the processing of conscious stimuli while the right amygdala was active during the processing of nonconscous stimuli. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a role in a variety of functions including emotional ones. The ACC may be important in conscious awareness of emotion.Lane, p. 359-361. Damage to the ACC is associated with decreased SCR to physical and psychological stimuli. Bilateral and unilateral damage both resulted in decreased SCR indicates that the right and left ACC's may specialized in certain aspects of emotional response. Anterior insula (AI) The left anterior insula (AI) increasingly responds to increasingly fearful stimuli. The AI may also be involved in the conscious experience of emotion.  Implications  Phenomena such as emotional lateralization may help describe how emotions arise, persist, and alter our behavior. Understanding emotional lateralization will help scientists understand emotion in general. Emotional lateralization may also play a role in psychological disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Future treatment of psychological disorders may have more targeted neurological treatments rather than ingested drugs. Symptoms that arise from confined regions of damage usually have stereotypical emotional and behavioral changes. Diagnosis for locating damaged regions that process emotion may aided by noticeable emotional changes categorized under one of the lateralized emotional control systems. Diagnosis and treatment for cardiovascular irregularities that arises from emotions states could be aided by understanding the physical basis of the psychological influences. Instead of treating the cardiovascular irregularities for psychological issues, treatment could target the lateralized brain regions. Limitation of Studies Like all human based scientific experiments there are limitations to what researchers can do. Attempting to study emotions is especially hard since emotions are complex and can lead to subjective response. Since the majority of experiments in emotional lateralization have been on fear this leaves the question of whether other emotions are also lateralized. Below are two major issues associated with many of the experiments studying emotion that require further explanation. =Sample size= A large percent of the human studies are of anomalies due to accidents, tumors, or attempts to cure disease (e.g. seizures) using lesioning. Since very few such cases exist the sample size of human studies of emotional lateralization are generally very limited and may be as small as single person. While these studies may provide a good insight into certain brain regions and their functions their conclusions are not definite. Animal studies may help in understanding this problem but emotions in humans are generally considered more complicated than in most animals. =Functional imaging= There are several limitations when using fMRI or PET to study emotional responses. Because fMRI measures changes in blood oxygenation, using the BOLD effect, its temporal resolution is limited by the haemodynamic response to several seconds. PET has similar limits, offering slightly better temporal resolution and slightly worse spatial resolution. =Lesioning= Lesions rarely are localized and can affect large areas of the brain. Processing in the brain is generally not localized and requires many areas of the brain to process. Furthermore, lesioning may interfere with pathways that span the lesion site. Thus, lesions are not always a good way to determine what specific brain areas do. Therefore, a degree of skepticism should be kept in mind when viewing lateralization data from lesion studies.

V. Sasi. It stars Mammootty, Shobhana, Rahman, Lalu Alex and Seema. The story was an adaptation of the 1912 novel Daddy-Long- Legs by Jean Webster. This film won Kerala State Film Awards for the Best Story (Padmarajan), Best Music Director (Shyam) and Best Female Singer (S. Janaki). Plot Sherly (Shobhana) is an orphan who is sponsored by an old man. On his death, the sponsorship is continued by his son Roy (Mammootty), who is a rich businessman. But Sherly does not know about him. She comes to College in the city where Roy's niece Mercy(Sabitha Anand) is her classmate and she meets Roy still not knowing he is her sponsor. On the other hand, Alex (Lalu Alex) introduces his brother Baby (Rahman) to Roy, and on Roy's advice Baby starts working in his firm. At Mercy's birthday party, Baby meets Sherly and falls in love with her, but her mind has already gone for Roy, still without knowing that he is her sponsor, and she rejects Baby. Later Sherly finds that Roy has no feelings for her, although he is secretly in love with her but does not wish to reveal it because of the age gap between them and also because Baby confuses her by lying to her that Roy and Elsie (Seema) were in love for a long time and couldn't marry because of Roy's father. Sherly is extremely frustrated at this and in a fit of rage goes to Elsie and lies to her that she is pregnant with Roy's baby. Elsie is shocked at this and goes to his office and scolds him for his irresponsibility but Roy tells her that it was not him. He calls Sherly to his office and shouts at her thinking that she is pregnant with Baby's baby and lied to the doctor that she was pregnant with his baby but she tells him that she was lying to break them up and also to prove her love for him and tells him that she cannot live without him. However, Mother Superior tells Roy that she was going to be sent to Italy to learn music and also that she was allowed to become a nun now.And on Mother Superior's (Kaviyoor Ponnamma) advice she decides to become a nun although she doesn't want to and plans to leave to Italy due to her gratitude towards Mother and her sponsor. So as a final meeting she sees Roy and tells him about this and that she cannot see him anymore. She also meets Baby and tells him everything including that she is an orphan and that she is going to be a nun. He, however, still was willing to marry her but she tells him that she is in love with someone else and he did not accept her so she decided to become a nun. He insists her on telling him who he is and she tells him that it is Roy. At this news he goes to Roy's office and shouts at him for what he did. But as a last wish she wants to see her unknown sponsor who has blessed her all her life with what she would have never had. Mother Superior meets Roy and discloses Sherly's wish to meet her sponsor before she leaves for Italy, however he refuses. Mother Superior handles over a letter from Sherly, for the very first time without their censoring and leaves. But just before leaving, Sherly is told that her sponsor will meet her. She rushes down the orphanage corridor to find.

She married Duke Ferdinand Maria of Bavaria on 5 February 1719 in Reichstadt, Bohemia, a younger son of Elector Maximilian II of Bavaria. She was still an infant when her father and older sister, Leopoldina, died within a month of one another in 1693.

Rather than dwelling in her father-in-law's capital, Florence, the couple initially took up residence at his wife's Bohemian domain, the castle of Ploskovice near Reichstadt. In less than a year Gian Gastone left his wife for Prague, thence resuming residence in Florence, and the couple never again cohabited. Maria wed Duke Ferdinand Maria of Bavaria, who became an Imperial general, on 5 February 1719 in Reichstadt, Bohemia. Of their three sons, all of whom bore the title Duke of Bavaria, none married. In 1723 Maria's stepfather became Grand Duke Gian Gastone of Tuscany, succeeding his elder brother, and her mother became Grand Duchess of Tuscany, although she never set foot in her husband's realm. Maria Anna's husband died in 1738. She herself died in 1751 aged 58.

He played all or part of eight seasons in Major League Baseball between 1923 and 1934 with the Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, and the Washington Senators in the American League, primarily as a second baseman.  Early career  Kerr made his professional baseball debut in 1923. He split that season and 1924 between the Tigers and the minor leagues, then went out west to the Pacific Coast League in 1925. After playing one season with the Salt Lake City Bees and three more with the Hollywood Stars, he was drafted by the White Sox in the 1928 rule 5 draft.  White Sox  Kerr became the White Sox starting second baseman in 1929, replacing Bill Hunnefield, who would be traded to the Toledo Mud Hens in midseason. He batted .258 in his first full major league season, hitting his first major league home run on August 21 off New York Yankees pitcher Ed Wells. Kerr missed parts of the 1930 season with various injuries, winding up as the backup middle infielder behind Bill Cissell and Greg Mulleavy. However, he returned to starting in 1931, batting .268 with a career-high 50 runs batted in. After the season, he was traded to the Senators with outfielder Carl Reynolds in exchange for pitchers Bump Hadley and Sad Sam Jones, as well as infielder Jackie Hayes, who would replace him as the starting second baseman.  Later career  Kerr spent the next three seasons on the Senators' bench behind second baseman Buddy Myer and future Hall of Fame shortstop Joe Cronin. During his tenure in Washington, he never played more than 51 games. He was on the Senators roster in 1933 when they lost in the World Series to the New York Giants. Kerr's sole appearance came in the finale (Game 5) when he pinch ran for centerfielder Fred Schulte with 2 out in the bottom of the 10th inning. In 1935, he served as a coach for the Senators, but in 1936 he became a player-manager in the Boston Red Sox organization. In 471 games over eight major league seasons, Kerr posted a .266 batting average (388-for-1457) with 172 runs, 6 home runs, 145 RBI and 115 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .966 fielding percentage playing at second and third base and shortstop. He spent the next five seasons playing and managing in the minor leagues. He managed in the Class B Western International League from 1937-1940. The first 3 seasons were with the Vancouver Maple Leafs, he was then hired to manage the Wenatchee Chiefs, a New York Yankees affiliate. His final season in baseball was 1941 when he managed and played second base for the Cheyenne Indians of the Class D Western League.

After retiring from the army in 1815, he briefly served again during the 1830s.

In the Battle of Abensberg on 20 April 1809, the corps fell upon the brigades of Ludwig Thierry and Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Fels√∂-Kubiny near Rohr in Niederbayern. After initial resistance, the outnumbered and outgeneraled Austrians were soon fleeing down the road to Rottenburg an der Laaber with the cuirassiers slashing at the fugitives.Arnold, James R.

The cuirassiers' role in the Battle of Landshut ended with the cavalrymen charging through the streets of the west bank suburb. Soon, infantry came up to occupy the town and later to successfully rush the bridges.Arnold Crisis, 143-145 Doumerc was a brigadier in √âtienne de Nansouty's division in 1807-1809. At the Battle of Eckm√ºhl on 22 April, the divisions of Nansouty and Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice, consisting of eight cuirassier and two carabinier regiments stormed the Bettel Berg,Arnold Crisis, 167 a hill crowned with a regiment of Austrian infantry, 12 light cavalry squadrons, and 16 artillery pieces.Arnold Crisis, 162 After seeing a Bavarian charge defeated, the 8,000 French heavy cavalry surged forward. The enemy cavalry force countercharged but was beaten and the armored French horsemen overran the hilltop, capturing two batteries of Austrian 12-pounder cannons.Arnold Crisis, 166-167 That evening, the famous moonlit cavalry action near Alteglofsheim occurred. Nansouty drew up his division with Jean-Marie Defrance's carabinier brigade in the center, flanked by the cuirassier brigades of Doumerc and Saint-Germain. Each brigade deployed with one regiment in the first line and one in the second. Bavarian and W√ºrttemberg cavalry formed to the right rear while Saint-Sulpice's division was held in reserve. The 66 Allied squadrons and 24 guns faced 30 squadrons of Austrians supported by 18 cannons. Andreas Schneller's brigade comprised 12 squadrons of cuirassiers; these were deployed on the right in two lines with one regiment of six squadrons in each line. On the Austrian left were 10 squadrons of hussars backed by eight squadrons of chevau-l√©gers in the second line.Arnold Crisis, 175-177 After an exchange of cannon fire, the Austrians bravely and foolishly charged while the French trotted forward to meet them. In the darkness, sparks could be seen as the cavalrymen of both sides hacked at each other. Soon the second lines were also engaged in a heaving mass of horsemen. Finally, the Austrians broke and fled. The French reported taking 300 prisoners; other losses are not known.Arnold Crisis, 178-179Petre, 181-182 French Cuirassier in 1809 On 23 April in the Battle of Ratisbon, the two sides fought another cavalry action. On this occasion, the 40 heavy cavalry squadrons of Nanouty and Saint-Sulpice were joined by French light cavalry squadrons led by Louis-Pierre Montbrun. The Austrians employed 24 squadrons of cuirassiers and 32 squadrons of light cavalry. The various cavalry clashes lasted for two hours, until the Austrians pulled back within Regensburg (Ratisbon).Petre, 188 While the other two brigades of Nansouty's division fought at the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 22 May, sources are not clear if Doumerc's brigade participated.Bowden & Tarbox, 87-88 At the time of the Battle of Wagram, the 2nd Cuirassiers numbered 708 horsemen while the 9th counted 776 troopers.Bowden & Tarbox, 152 On 6 July, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen launched a dangerous counterattack against the French left wing. Napoleon threw Nansouty's division at Johann Kollowrat's Austrian III Armeekorps in attempt to stop his enemies. The charge drove a wedge between Kollowrat and the neighboring I Reserve Armeekorps, but was ultimately repulsed. The division lost 164 men killed, 436 men wounded, and 1,141 horses destroyed. Doumerc's 9th Cuirassiers lost its colonel and six officers wounded, 31 killed and 55 wounded. Even though the effort failed, it allowed Napoleon to gain the initiative. After this moment in the battle, the Austrian were forced to react to French maneuvers.Arnold, James R. Napoleon Conquers Austria. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 1995. . 149 In the 1812 invasion of Russia, Doumerc led the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division, a part of the III Cavalry Corps under Emmanuel Grouchy.Chandler, David. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Macmillan, 1966. 1111. Chandler mislabels Doumerc's division as the 5th Heavy.Smith, 386. Smith correctly lists the 3rd Heavy. Detached from its parent corps, the 3rd division fought at the First Battle of Polotsk on 16 to 18 August 1812. On the first day, Marshal Nicolas Oudinot suffered a tactical defeat and was wounded. Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr took over and on the 17th, he maneuvered as if preparing to retreat. The next day, he hurled the VI Corps, consisting of Bavarians, at the Russian left flank. The French II Corps attacked the Russian center while the French cavalry opposed the Russian right. Staring at defeat, the Russian commander Peter Wittgenstein threw in his last reserves, headed by depot squadrons of the Lifeguard Uhlans, Hussars, and Dragoons. The Russian horsemen achieved initial success. But they were checked by a Swiss regiment and broken by a charge of the 4th Cuirassier Regiment led by Fr√©d√©ric de Berckheim, one of Doumerc's brigadiers.Coates-Wright, Philipp. \\"Gouvion St.-Cyr: The Owl\\". Chandler, David, ed. Napoleon's Marshals. New York: Macmillan, 1987. . 133-135. Coates- Wright claims that the Chevalier Guard led the attack, but it was serving with the main army.Smith, 386. Smith lists the Lifeguard units involved.Smith, 391. Smith shows the Chevalier Garde serving at Borodino with the main army. First Battle of Polotsk Doumerc led his division at the Second Battle of Polotsk on 18 to 20 October.Smith, 396 The 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division, including the 4th, 7th, and 14th Cuirassier Regiments, fought at the Battle of Berezina on 26 to 29 December.Smith, 406 On the 26th, Oudinot and 11,000 troops, among them the 3rd Heavy, crossed to the west bank of the Berezina River and prepared to defend the two improvised bridges against a Russian attack. The next day, Pavel Chichagov belatedly realized that Napoleon had tricked him out of position and began attacking the French foothold from the south. On the 28th, Chichagov mounted a full-scale attack. During the action Oudinot was badly wounded and replaced in command by Michel Ney. Doumerc led his heavies in a \\"brilliant charge\\" that broke the back of Chichagov's effort and inflicted 2,000 casualties on the Russians. This and other heroic actions helped Napoleon's army to escape a deadly trap.Chandler Campaigns, 844. Chandler spells it \\"Dumerc\\". Throughout the 1813 campaign, Doumerc continued to lead the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division. He was present at the Battle of L√ºtzen on 2 MaySmith, 417 and at the Battle of Bautzen on 20 and 21 May.Smith, 421 On 26 and 27 August, he commanded his division in Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg's I Cavalry Corps at the Battle of Dresden. The division included the 4th and 7th Cuirassiers in Charles Lalaing d'Audenarde's brigade and the 7th, 23rd, 28th, and 30th Dragoon Regiments in Marie Antoine de Reiset's brigade, as well as two horse artillery batteries.Smith, 444 Directed by Marshal Joachim Murat, the French cavalry fell upon the Allied left wing, which was isolated from the center and right by a rain-flooded stream. Unable to effectively defend itself because of wet powder, Ignaz Gyulai's Austrian corps was severely mauled by the rampaging French horsemen, backed by infantry and artillery. Mesko, the same general defeated in 1809, saw his division overrun before being taken prisoner by a trooper from Doumerc's 23rd Dragoons. A number of Austrian battalions were routed or forced to surrender.http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/BATTLE_OF_DRESDEN.htm napolun.com Battle of Dresden Altogether, 13,000 prisoners fell into French hands in this sector.Chandler Campaigns, 911 Latour-Maubourg At the Battle of Leipzig on 16 October 1813, Napoleon made a bid to crush Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia. During the day's action, Doumerc took command of the I Cavalry Corps after Latour-Maubourg suffered a bad wound. After inconclusive fighting in the morning, the French emperor directed his cavalry to smash a hole in the Allied line at 2:00 PM. Schwarzenberg brought up the Austrian reserve cavalry and managed to slow the French drive. About 2:30 PM, Doumerc spotted a weak point in the enemy defenses and launched √âtienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle's 1st Heavy Cavalry Division at it. The charge quickly dispersed two infantry battalions, overran 26 guns, and nearly cut its way to Czar Alexander I of Russia's headquarters. However, before either Murat or Doumerc could bring up support, Bordesoulle was counterattacked by the Czar's escort and a large force of Russian cuirassiers. The decisive moment passed and the day's battle ended with the Allies driven back to their start line but intact.Chandler Campaigns, 929-931 After Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig, his former ally Bavaria joined the Allies and sent a corps to cut him off from France. At the Battle of Hanau, the French emperor completely outgeneraled the Bavarian Karl Philipp von Wrede, crushing his left flank with a powerful attack and carving an escape route for his troops.Chandler Campaigns, 938 Doumerc led the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division in the action.Smith, 474 At the Battle of La Rothiere on 1 February 1814, Doumerc led a 1,900-strong light cavalry division in Marshal Auguste Marmont's corps. His command consisted of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Chasseurs √† cheval, the 1st Provisional Hussars, and 12 pieces of horse artillery.http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/French_Order_of_Battle_La_Rothiere.htm napolun.com French Order of Battle - La Rothiere 1814 Doumerc led his cavalry division at the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February.Smith, 494 Later career After the abdication of Napoleon, Doumerc offered his services to King Louis XVIII of France. The king made him inspector general of three military districts, a Chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis, and a Grand Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. During the Hundred Days, Doumerc accepted a military appointment by Napoleon. Because of this ill-timed move, he was no longer employed after the Battle of Waterloo. The 1830 July Revolution restored him to favor and he was named commander of the 18th Military Division by King Louis Philippe I. Upon retirement in 1832, the king bestowed upon him the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur. Doumerc died on 29 March 1847 in Paris. DOUMERC is engraved on Column 1 of the Arc de Triomphe. A French military installation, the Quartier Doumerc was established in 1865 at Montauban, the general's birthplace. Named after the cavalry general, it housed the 10th Dragoons until 1936, when the 7th Regiment of Spahis took up residence. After the Second World War, the 9th Parachute and 35th Artillery Regiments occupied the camp. The Quartier Doumerc currently hosts the 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment.http://www.amicale-17rgp.fr/vone/garnison/doumerc.html amicale-17rgp.fr Le quartier Doumerc Notes References * Arnold, James R.

The differences between these waves are shaped by historical factors, the economic climate during historical periods, and leaders' response to these forces, which over time have created five strategies that differ from their predecessors. The five waves have all been designed to accomplish the same goal: to help entrepreneurs and businesses discover and expand markets for their services. Often these waves operate concurrently (thus, overlapping), or within a single economic development plan. First-wave economic development First-wave economic development, or the Growth Promotion Approach, is characterized by a focus on industrial recruitment through financial incentives such as tax abatement and loans in order to lower costs associated with land, infrastructure, and labor. This method of business attraction was first used in the United States in the 1930s as a response to the Great Depression. The economic development activities in this phase are sometimes called \\"smokestack-chasing.\\" =Smokestack-Chasing= This approach to economic development has its foundation in the \\"boosterism\\" of small towns in early North America. Typically in this wave, local economic developers focus attention on attracting one major employer to the region - be it a factory, mine, college, or prison. The first step in smokestack-chasing is to promote the location to the potential employer. Next, the economic developer seeks to improve the likelihood of the employer locating within the area by providing incentives (e.g., cheap land or labor, lax environmental regulations). Detractors of this form of economic development have labeled it haphazard and suggested that smokestack-chasing is \\"likely to prove ineffective,\\" while others have said the result of smokestack-chasing is likely mixed, with increases in short-term job growth and per capita income as well as political support. Second-wave economic development Second-wave development strategies have their roots in the increase of worldwide competition, the descent of American manufacturing, and the critical evaluations of first-wave techniques of the late 1960s. These critiques labeled first-wave development as a zero-sum game between elites that instead of creating jobs merely transferred opportunities from one area to another at the benefit of \\"land-based\\" elites. The first use of second-wave strategies was in the late 1960s and early 70s. In second-wave economic development, practitioners began to use strategies to retain and expand existing firms. They also included a focus on small business development through entrepreneurial tools like loans and enterprise zones. Third-wave economic development Third-wave was first identified in the early 1990s, and is marked by a declining emphasis on industrial attraction and retention and an increasing focus on strategies such as public-private partnerships, establishing regional networks, developing industrial clusters, and increasing human capital. Third-wave economic development focuses on ‚Äúbroadening of the foundation for effective economic development.‚Äù It also stresses the importance of nurturing and advancing local and sectoral resources resulting in more complex economic development planning. States increasingly see themselves as key players in an evolving international economic competition ‚Äì one that requires third-wave efforts to shift to an industry-wide perspective, and in many instances improves the socio-economic standing of its citizens through equity planning during the strategic economic development process. Fourth-wave economic development This wave is also called sustainable economic development, and includes strategies that enhance environmental quality and self-sufficiency. In this context, sustainability refers to the process economic developers employ to determine a balanced approach to development that take into consideration \\"a full range of economic, environmental, and social characteristics that together comprise 'community,'\\" or development that conciliates historically conflicting stakes: promotion of the economy, equitable distribution of economic growth, and the preservation of the natural environment. =Sustainable Local Economic Development (SLED)= This wave has also been referred to as sustainable local economic development (SLED) because of the emphasis on local community. Pathways Out of Poverty Locations Although there are various definitions of sustainability or SLED, most definitions share the following principles: * quality of life (the connection between environment, economy, and social justice) * fairness and equity * participation and partnership * environmental stewardship * concerns for our future and the precautionary principle An example of this approach applied to workforce training is the U.S. program Pathways out of Poverty. Fifth-wave economic development The fifth-wave of economic development began in the 1990s with a two-fold interest in providing market solutions and regional strategies for development. The idea of a comparative advantage has been integral to the development of the fifth-wave. This wave has been marked by economic developers who work to emphasize unmet demand, function as a go- between with government to identify financing, and build partnerships for minority businesses between the public and private sector. The fifth-wave has led to concerns about displacement of impoverished populations due to gentrification.

Delacroix, who was of French origin, met the king in Paris as a young girl, when she was only 16 and he was 65. At that time, she earned her living from prostitution. They soon embarked upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, baronne de Vaughan (Baroness Vaughan). Because of these presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed-induced actions in the Congo Free State, his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited from the king's income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo (‚ÄúThe Queen of the Congo‚Äù). She and Leopold married in a religious ceremony five days before his death, though their failure to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage void under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income ‚Äì all of which turned her into a multimillionaire. For years, the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 in Cambo-les-Bains, France. Early life There remains a small degree of mystery concerning Caroline's early life. One account states that her father, Jules Delacroix, was a janitor of the French Legation at Bucharest. Another states that her father lived in Bucharest to seek his fortune, and she was born there as the thirteenth child of her parents. In her youth, Caroline worked as a barmaid. Various sources assert that Caroline was a prostitute living in Paris. As a young woman, she was the mistress of Antoine-Emmanuel Durrieux, a former officer in the French army. According to Adam Hochschild, Durrieux liked to support the two of them by betting on horse races; when his luck soured, he became a form of pimp, prostituting Caroline to well-born clients. They undertook their schemes at the √âlys√©e Palace, but frequently left debts unpaid. One day in 1900, while residing in Paris, Leopold II of Belgium heard of her \\"attractions\\" and felt interested in her modest beginnings. A woman sent by Leopold informed Caroline, \\"Madame, I am sent to you by a gentleman who has noticed you. He is a very high personage, but his exalted position obliges me to withhold his name\\". A meeting was arranged for the following day; Caroline went to a secluded room, where Leopold arrived with two aides. As Leopold II was unknown to her, Caroline was so flustered with the encounter that she mixed up Belgium and Sweden in the king's presence, referring to him as His Majesty Oscar, to his surprise and amusement. The two aides' purpose soon became clear: one sat on each side of her and began asking questions that required her to \\"turn my head first to the right, then to the left ... their only aim, as I learned later, being to show off my two profiles to the mute personage\\", according to her memoirs. Leopold confessed himself pleased and invited Caroline to Austria with him; a large sum of money duly arrived the next day, along with some empty trunks, as Leopold was aware that she loved to buy clothes.Hochschild, p. 222. Relationship with Leopold II =Reaction in the press= As a mere sixteen-year-old (compared with Leopold's age of 65), Caroline's relationship with the old king quickly became public knowledge, causing Leopold to be labeled lecherous and besotted. Though Leopold had previously embarked upon affairs with other mistresses (earning him the nickname le roi des Belges et des Belles), his affair with Caroline was unique, and the Belgian press in particular enjoyed publicising their affair for years. Her habit of accompanying Leopold to fashionable spas in Europe provoked further disbelief and outrage, with some speculating that she perversely pleasured the old king with the use of strategically placed mirrors and \\"special\\" equipment. The young mistress became known as la reine du Congo because the great wealth she accumulated from Leopold came from his colony. She became his companion for the last years of his life, as his estranged wife Queen Marie Henriette died in 1902. Their relationship coincided with Leopold's worsening international reputation, which was the result of his actions and orders concerning the Congo Free State. Hochschild writes that their affair ironically lost Leopold more popularity in Belgium than any of his crimes in the Congo; consequently, few of his former allies were willing to defend him once he became the target of the international protest movement led by the Congo Reform Association. Belgian socialists in particular used the affair to prove that because Leopold was in his \\"dotage\\" and under the control of a \\"rapacious and ambitious woman\\", he was unfit to govern. =A wealthy mistress= A postcard of Caroline and Leopold After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's relationship with Caroline became flagrantly open, and he placed her across from his Laeken mansion, in the Villa Vanderborght, even building a pedestrian bridge (above the ground, and over the fences of the mansion) so he could see her at will. The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although this may have been justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.Hochschild, pp. 222‚Äì23. Leopold spent vast sums of money on gifts and estates for his young mistress, presenting for instance the Villa Leopolda to Caroline in 1902. She frequently traveled to Paris to visit her dress- and hat-maker, once bragging that she spent three million francs on dresses at a single store on one occasion.Hochschild, p. 223. Caroline once complained to Leopold that the evening express train back to Brussels gave her little time to shop, causing Leopold to arrange it so that the train would leave an hour later. When pregnant with their first child, the king and the French government even split the cost of constructing a new road close to her villa so that her ride would not be uncomfortable. Taking Caroline with him everywhere, the king spent much of his time outside Belgium on his various properties throughout Western Europe, and was much resented by the Belgian people as a result. Much of this time was spent with Caroline and their two sons at his estate at Cap Ferrat in southern France. Caroline also stayed at Chateau de Larmoy, which Leopold had rented for her; he acquired the French Chateau de Balaincourt as well as a villa in Brussels, where Caroline had no scruples in appearing in public. Though typically traveling incognito, she accompanied Leopold to the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901, causing a great scandal. Her unpopularity in Belgium increased dramatically once it began to be realized that all of Leopold's riches from the Congo were not benefiting his country, but rather himself and his young mistress. A contemporary cartoon lampooning Leopold's relationship with Caroline. A priest is exclaiming, \\"Oh Sire! At your age!\\" and the king answers \\"Try it for yourself!\\" As the years went by and the king became increasingly prone to outbursts of anger, breaking with all his old relationships, it was said that only in Caroline and their sons' company did Leopold \\"recapture some of his vitality and Germanic humour\\".Pakenham, p. 662. Caroline was described as having been above average in height, \\"plump but graceful, with a beautiful complexion and skin\\", with masses of chestnut hair; in character, she was \\"haughty, sharp, irritable\\" and ill-educated, and insisted on being treated with respect or else one would have to face the king's displeasure. She was also said to be in possession of \\"vivid conversational powers\\" and \\"dazzling youthfulness\\". Caroline was well- used to Leopold's \\"quirks\\", such as his extreme hypochondria; for instance, when she needed free time for herself, she coughed and pretended to have a cold; she used this \\"weapon\\" to keep scheming female rivals from gaining favor with the king as well, telling Leopold that they had colds. Rather than ignore their age difference, Caroline and Leopold seemed to enjoy it, she calling him Tr√®s Vieux and he calling her Tr√®s Belle. =Marriage= Caroline LaCroix about 1909 The king became ill from an \\"intestinal blockage\\" at his home at Laeken, and his mistress and two sons rushed to his side.Hochschild, p. 265. Five days before his death, on 12 December 1909, King Leopold married Caroline in a religious ceremony performed by his personal chaplain. The marriage had no legal authority under Belgian law, as it was performed religiously, not civilly. It was recognized by the Vatican, as their wedding was solemnized in accordance with the Catholic Church's religious rites.Rappoport, pp. 267‚Äì68. The marriage caused a great scandal in Belgium, as its citizens were shocked that the Church had not only sanctioned it, but also allowed Caroline to remain at his bedside, even when the priest was present. Despite their marriage, Caroline had to hide out of sight whenever a visitor arrived to see the king, though she stayed by his side otherwise. Leopold died in the presence of Caroline and two nurses; his youngest legitimate child Princess Cl√©mentine, who had been barred from entering his palace before, was still not allowed to go into his room despite his weakening condition. Princesses Louise and St√©phanie also traveled to Brussels for a hoped-for reconciliation with their father and changes to the king's will, but Leopold turned them away. Caroline claimed that right before his passing, Leopold turned to his aide Baron Auguste Goffinet and said \\"I present you my widow. I place her under your protection during the few days she'll spend in Belgium after my death\\".Hochschild, p. 266. Hochschild speculates that it is likely the king said this or something similar, as he was well-aware how much his daughters and the public loathed her, particularly when they discovered just how much he had left her and their sons. =Issue= Caroline and Leopold had two sons together: * Lucien Philippe Marie Antoine (9 February 1906 ‚Äì 1984), Duke of Tervuren; he married Lucie Gracieuse Mundutey on 1 March 1927. * Philippe Henri Marie Fran√ßois (16 October 1907 ‚Äì 21 August 1914), Count of Ravenstein; died young. Like Caroline herself (who was created Baroness Vaughan upon the birth of their first son), the two boys were granted courtesy titles, but no official royal decrees were ever issued by Leopold, the Belgian government, or any other foreign state, causing them to be merely honorary.Hochschild, p. 224. Because of their parents' legally invalid marriage, their two sons were still deemed illegitimate. Upon each of their births, they had been registered in France under Caroline's name; no mention of Leopold or another potential father was made. Despite these facts, there were fears in Belgium that Leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to the throne. Had Leopold married in a legal civil ceremony, the boy could have indeed inherited the throne, because all classes were equal under the Belgian constitution, and thus their marriage would not have been considered morganatic. In 1910, the two boys were adopted by Antoine Durrieux, whom Caroline married soon after Leopold's death. Leopold was devoted to his sons, and much of the wealth Caroline inherited went to the two; she once reportedly boasted that because she was able to marry the king, her sons were in better standings than Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St Albans, the illegitimate son of Nell Gwyn and Charles II of England. Because of these gifts, Caroline was loathed by the Belgian public; on one occasion, her carriage was stoned on the streets of Brussels. Their second son was born with a deformed hand, leading a cartoon to depict Leopold holding the child surrounded by Congolese corpses with their hands sliced off: the caption said Vengeance from on high.Rappoport, p. 268. Later years Leopold gave his mistress vast sums of money by investing large sums in her name or confiding in trustees for her benefit. He also arranged for his two sons to be well provided for after his death. Under Belgian law, his three remaining legitimate children were entitled to a considerable portion of his estate, regardless of the contents of his will. However, this applied only in Belgium and not abroad; consequently, much of the wealth he distributed for safekeeping was in foreign investments or in the shape of paintings, bric-a- brac, and art treasures that could be easily converted into cash. Leopold transferred Caroline a fortune in Congo securities, which were added to the already vast sum of six million francs he had previously presented her. Princess Louise soon went after these securities, but with the help of men loyal to the king, Caroline was able to safely spirit away the majority of her wealth to Paris; two of her estates (in Brussels and in France) were boarded up however, disallowing her from entering them. The exact degree of Caroline's wealth was always problematic to trace, as the king had placed so much of it in different sources often difficult to locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death. One 1912 source for instance reported that out of the king's estimated estate of $65,000,000, Caroline received $7,000,000, while others stressed still higher numbers, and that the majority of it came from Congo shares. =Legal suits= Princesses St√©phanie and Louise, who attempted to gain back their father's wealth from Caroline. The old king's estrangement from his three daughters from his first marriage (Princesses Louise, St√©phanie, and Cl√©mentine) spurred Leopold to keep or give as much wealth away as possible in order to disinherit the girls. An Austrian newspaper claimed that right before he died, Leopold personally gave Caroline his large collection of personal letters as well as documents detailing information about various European royal figures, which greatly worried his eldest daughter.Wheeler, p. 140. After his death, the three princesses sued his estate for several million francs, although this was only a very small portion compared with the fortune he accumulated. The fortune was so large that the princesses were still attempting to recover some of Caroline's wealth four years after their father's death, claiming that Caroline and Durrieux had speedily ransacked one of Leopold's properties in Paris and seized important financial documents before the Belgian envoy to France appeared. A trust of $10,000,000 the king had placed in Caroline and their two sons' names became a target of the princesses; they and the Belgian government argued that the trust formed part of Leopold's private estate, and thus all three girls and the government had a right to their share, as its funds had derived from the Congo Free State. The Belgian government's lawsuit succeeded, allowing them to collect the entire trust, but it also diminished the share the princesses received (as each collected a comparatively meager $1,000,000). Belgian statesman Emile Vandervelde later charged in an open letter that Leopold had given Caroline $6,000,000 worth of Congo bonds which had been found to be previously missing when Belgium annexed the colony. =Second marriage, divorce and death= An extremely rich widow (Leopold's gifts left her a multimillionaire), Caroline continued to appear in newspapers long after Leopold's death. She married Antoine Durrieux (1865-1917), her former love and longtime friend, in 1910, seven months after the king's death. He was formerly a non-commissioned officer in the French army, and served as her chief agent at the time of Leopold's death, helping her collect the necessary papers to secure her inherited fortune. Because of Durrieux's earlier role in prostituting Caroline off for money, Adam Hochschild speculates that if she had shared some of her riches with him, their arrangement was \\"surely one of the most successful feats of pimpery of all time\\". Though Durrieux recognized her two sons as his own offspring, giving them his surname, he disliked how Caroline insisted he acknowledge their noble ranks when in their presence. Caroline and her second husband divorced soon after, and she was able to keep the bulk of her wealth intact (though she settled on Durrieux a sum of one million dollars in order to retain custody of her two sons). Various suitors often in her entourage, such as Count Boni de Castellane and Gaston Bonnefoy, were reported to be engaged or interested in her, particularly after her divorce. She never remarried. Caroline's younger son died in 1914, but the elder lived a long, quiet life on his inherited wealth, dying in 1984. In 1937, Caroline published her memoirs, A commoner married a king: As told by Baroness de Vaughan to Paul Faure; in it, she stated she had loved and was faithful to the king, and that he had loved her and their two sons. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 at Cambo, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques in France.

Construction work began on August 23, 2007 and the first commercial services began operating in December 1, 2012, nearly one year behind schedule. The line is the world's first alpine high-speed railway operating at high latitudes and low temperatures in winter. The trains can continue operating even with snow on the line and the tracks are fitted with de-icing technology. The project cost CN¬•95 billion, which was 25% more than the original budget. At the time of completion, the railway was the northernmost high-speed line in China. The climate of northeast China poses a challenge to the design; parts of the line had to be rebuilt before the opening due to deformation caused by frost heaving. Eventually, it was decided that the route could be opened for commercial services on December 1, 2012; however, during winters (December through March) it operates a winter timetable, with the maximum running speed of . In summer, the service runs an expanded timetable with services running at a higher speed of up to . However, the line has a design speed of up to . The summer high-speed services also have higher ticket prices than the slower winter service; however, some trains continue to run all year at the speed and lower price, giving travellers a choice of speed versus ticket price. Under the winter timetable, the journey from Dalian to Harbin takes five hours eighteen minutes. In summer, the higher speeds reduce the journey time to just three and a half hours. Test runs along the entire railway started on October 8, 2012. These were restricted to the winter service speed of . The first commercial passenger services started on December 1, 2012 with two trains leaving simultaneously, one from Dalian and the other from the new Harbin West station. During the first 52 days of operation, the line transported 2.856 million passengers. By the end of March, there had been 9.4 million passenger trips on the line, an average of 78,000 per day. During the four weeks of the Chinese spring festival, passengers reached peaks of 164,000 per day. Testing of services at the increased summer speed of began in April 2013 after a delay of one month. Commercial services on the summer schedule began on the April 21st, 2013. The line operates 67 pairs of CRH380BG type alpine EMU trains. These have been specially modified for the Hada railway which must cope with temperatures as low as in winter. Extra insulation has been added within the skin of the carriages and even the vacuum toilets have been modified to operate in this extreme cold. The track has been specially designed to cope with extremes in temperature. In winter, the temperatures on the route can fall to while in summer they can reach . Heavy snowfall in the area is also common during winter. This large change in temperature can cause frost heave. As the water in the ground freezes in winter, it expands. In summer the ice melts and water drains causing shrinkage. This creates distortion on the ground surface that ordinary high speed railway lines could not cope with. To combat frost heave, 70% of the line is constructed above the ground surface on viaducts. During construction, about 20 percent of the track that had been built directly on the ground had to be redesigned and rebuilt due to frost damage. This delayed the opening of the line by about a year.

Construction and acquisition Williams was built as the private vessel Grayling - described by sources both as a wooden-hulled screw steam yacht and as a motorboat \\\\- in 1907 by B. Frank Wood at City Island, The Bronx, New York, for Justus Ruperti of New York City to a design by the firm of Tams, Lemoine, and Crane. Apparently she later was renamed Williams. The U.S. Navy eventually acquired Williams for use as a section patrol vessel during World War I. She was commissioned at New York City as USS Williams (SP-498) on 16 March 1918 with Chief Boatswain M. T. Moran, USNRF, in command. World War I operations During her \\"unofficial trial trip\\"This quotation, from Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, is unattributed. on 18 March 1918, Williams suffered a broken propeller shaft and was towed to the Philadelphia Marine Basin for repairs. One month later, while being taken in tow by the patrol yacht , Williams was jammed between Aramis and the pier, suffering damage again. Apparently still without propulsion, Williams was towed to an offshore mooring and used for a month as a floating classroom by groups of hydrophone (or \\"listening tube\\") trainees, or \\"listeners.\\" At the end of each day, she was towed back to port. Drydocked in May 1918, Williams made a trial trip under her own power on 14 May 1918, her first time underway under her own power in nearly two months. On 28 May 1918, Williamss propeller struck the bottom while she was operating off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and was damaged. She soon underwent repairs, after which she trained \\"listeners\\" using \\"listening tubes\\" for the remainder of the spring and summer of 1918. She suffered slight damage in collision with the salvage tug on 27 September 1918. At 1045 hours on 16 October 1918, Williams got underway quickly to come to the assistance of the sinking British steamer Port Phillip. She lay to off Port Phillip and presumably rendered assistance, although she did not enter her activities into her logbook. On 17 October 1918, all listening gear was removed from Williams and stored and she was drydocked for repairs at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. She apparently remained at the shipyard through the end of World War I on 11 November 1918 and into December 1918.

After the war, in 1919, Cochrane joined the Faculty of Ancient History at the University of Toronto. His Thucydides and the Science of History appeared in 1929, and his best-known work, Christianity and Classical Culture, in 1940. The latter work was praised by W.H. Auden, and it was in addition described by Harold Innis as \\"the first major Canadian contribution to the intellectual history of the West\\". In it Cochrane investigated the political and cultural interaction between the Romans and Christians in the early days of Christianity. In 2017, a new collection of Cochrane's post-humously published writings and collected essays appeared, Augustine and the Problem of Power: The Essays and Lectures of Charles Norris Cochrane. The title essay in this volume was originally delivered as the 1945 Nathaniel W. Taylor Lectures at Yale University Divinity School. Cochrane expressed the opinion that the philosophy of Augustine largely replaced classical Greek philosophy as the dominant intellectual world view. In his philosophy and historiography, Cochrane was influenced by R.G. Collingwood. The Hegelian philosopher James Doull was among his students.

He was a member of Ma Bufang's family, Ma Biao was the eldest son of Ma Haiqing È¶¨Êµ∑Ê∏Ö, who was the sixth younger brother of Ma Haiyan, the grandfather of Ma Bufang. Life =Boxer Rebellion= Ma was too young to participate in the First Sino-Japanese War, in which he wanted to fight. He then joined the Kansu Braves, serving under Ma Haiyan, fought against the foreigners in the Boxer Rebellion at the Battle of Peking (1900) and helped guard the Imperial Court when it evacuated to Xi'an. =Qinghai-Tibet war= He was prominent in the Qinghai ‚Äì Tibet War, a theater of the Sino-Tibetan War. He was sent by Ma Bufang to create an incident against the Tibetan army at a monastery at Yushu. This set off the Qinghai Tibet War. In 1931 Ma Biao became leader of the Yushu Defense Brigade. He was the second brigade commander while the first brigade was led by Ma Xun. Wang Jiamei was his secretary during the war against Tibet. Ma Biao fought to defend Lesser Surmang against the attacking Tibetans on 24‚Äì26 March 1932. The invading Tibetan forces massively outnumbered Ma Biao's defending Qinghai forces. Cai Zuozhen was fighting on the Qinghai side against the invading Tibetans. The local Qinghai Tibetan Buddhist Buqing tribal chief Cai Zuozhen was on the side of the Qinghai government. Their forces retreated to the capital of Yushu county, Jiegue, under Ma Biao to defend it against the Tibetans while the Republic of China government under Chiang Kai-shek was petitioned for military air like wireless telegraphs, money, ammunition and rifles. A wireless telegraph was sent and solved the communication problem. Ma Xun was sent to reinforce the Qinghai forces and accompanied by propagandists while mobile films, and medical treatment provided by doctors to awe the primitive Tibetan locals. Ma Xun reinforced Jiegu after Ma Biao fought for more than 2 months against the Tibetans. The Tibetan army numbered 3,000. Although the Tibetans outnumbered the Qinghai soldiers the Tibetans suffered more dead in battle than the Qinghai army. Repeated Tibetan attacks were repulsed by Ma Biao even though they outnumbered his army since the Tibetans were poorly prepared for fighting in war. Dud cannon rounds were fired by the Tibetans and their artillery was useless. Ma Lu was sent with more reinforcements to assist Ma Biao and Ma Xun along with La Pingfu. Jiegu's siege was relieved by La Pingfu on 20 August 1932, which freed Ma Biao and Ma Xun's soldiers to destroy the Tibetan army. Hand to hand combat with swords ensued as the Tibetan army was slaughtered by the \\"Great Sword\\" group of the Qinghai army during an attack during midnight by Ma Biao and Ma Xun. The Tibetans suffered massive casualties and fled the battlefield as they were routed. The land occupied in Yushu by the Tibetans was retaken. Both the Tibetan army and Ma Biao's soldiers committed war crimes according to Cai. Tibetan soldiers had raped nuns and women (local Qinghai Tibetans) after looting monasteries and destroying villages in Yushu while Tibetan soldiers who were surrendering and fleeing were summarily executed by Ma Biao's soldiers and supplies were seized from the local nomad civilians by Ma Biao's army. Ma Biao ordered the religious books, items, and statues of the Tibetan Gadan monastery which had started the war, to be destroyed since he was furious at their role in the war. He ordered the burning of the monastery by the Yushu Tibetan Buddhist chief Cai. Cai lied that the temple was burned since he could not bring himself to burn it. Ma Biao seized thousands of silver dollars worth of items from local nomads as retribution for them assisting the invading Tibetan army. On 24 and 27 August, massive artillery duels occurred in Surmang between the Tibetans and Qinghai army. 200 Tibetans soldiers were killed in battle by the Qinghai army after the Tibetans came to reinforce their positions. Greater Surmang was abandoned by the Tibetans as they came under attack by La Pingfu on 2 September. In Batang, La Pingfu, Ma Biao, and Ma Xun met Ma Lu's reinforcements on 20 September. Liu Wenhui, the Xikang warlord, had reached an agreement with Ma Bufang and Ma Lin's Qinghai army to strike the Tibetans in Xikang. A joint Xikang-Qinghai attack against the Tibetan army at Qingke monastery led to a Tibetan retreat from the monastery and the Jinsha river. Xikang army officers were allowed to issue commands to Ma Bufang's Qinghai soldiers by Ma Bufang and telegraphs operated by Liu Wenhui sent messages for Ma Bufang to his soldiers. The reputation of the Muslim forces of Ma Bufang was boosted by the war and victory against the Tibetan army. The stature of Ma Biao rose over his role in the war and later in 1937 his battles against the Japanese propelled him to fame nationwide in China. The control of China over the border area of Kham and Yushu with Tibet was guarded by the Qinghai army. Chinese Muslim run schools used their victory in the war against Tibet to show how they defended the integrity of China's territory as it was put in danger since the Japanese invasion. He was commander of Yushu Defense Command, Qinghai Province, and he also led the 1st Provisional Cavalry Division, 8th Cavalry Division, 2nd Cavalry Army, and served on the Military Advisory Council. =Second Sino-Japanese war= Ma Biao participated in encirclement campaigns against the Communists.‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ∑•ÂÜúÁ∫¢ÂÜõË•øË∑ØÂÜõ He fought in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in the Chinese Civil War.

The play presented Ma Biao and Ma Bufang as heroes who defended Yushu from being lost to the Tibetans and comparing it to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, saying the Muslims stopped the same scenario from happening in Yushu. Ma Biao and his fight against the Japanese were hailed at the schools of the Islam Progressive Council of Qinghai. The emphasis on military training in schools and their efforts to defend China were emphasized in Kunlun magazine by Muslims. In 1939 his battles against the Japanese led to recognition across China. ‚ÄúÊÅ®‰∏çÂæóÈ¶¨Ë∏èÂÄ≠È¨ºÔºåÁµ¶ÊàëÂ∑≤Ê≠ªÂÖàÁÉàÈõ™‰ªáÔºåËàáÂæåËº©Áà≠ÂÖâ‚Äù„ÄÇ \\"I am eager to stomp on the dwarf devils (A derogatory term for Japanese), I will give vengeance for the already dead martyrs, achieving glory with the younger generation.\\" said by Ma Biao with reference to his service in the Boxer Rebellion where he already fought the Japanese before World War II.http://military.china.com/history4/62/20150831/20303256_all.htmlhttp://military.people.com.cn/n/2015/0831/c1011-27533214.html By the time of World War II he had been in the military for over 40 years, and his service in World War II against the Japanese was regarded as the pinnacle of his achievements by himself. Ma Biao crushed the Japanese at the Battle of Huaiyang.http://qh.people.com.cn/n/2015/0831/c181467-26189312.html Ma Bufang's army battled extensively in bloody battles against the Japanese in Henan province and fought against White Lotus elements who had allied with the Japanese. The Qinghai Chinese, Salar, Chinese Muslim, Dongxiang, and Tibetan troops were under the commander of Ma Biao, being sent to fight to the death against the Imperial Japanese Army, or committed suicide refusing to be taken prisoner. When they defeated the Japanese, the Muslim troops slaughtered all of them except for a few prisoners to send back to Qinghai prove that they were victorious. In September 1940, when the Japanese made an offensive against the Muslim Qinghai troops, the Muslims ambushed them and killed so many of them they were forced to retreat. The Japanese could not even pick up their dead, they instead cut an arm from their corpses limbs for cremation to send back to Japan. The Japanese did not dare make an offensive like that again. They were known as È©¨ËÉ°Â≠êÂÜõ or È©¨ÂõûÂ≠êÂÜõ by the Japanese. During World War II, the China Information Publishing Company included an article on Ma Biao in Volume 4 of its publication \\"China at War\\", which discussed both his service in the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and his fight against the Japanese in World War II in Henan. According to the article, he knew four languages: an indigenous dialect, Tibetan, Arabic, and Chinese. Tibetan Lamaists (Tibetan Buddhists) made up 20% of his soldiers, Han Chinese made up 30% of his soldiers, and various Muslim ethnicities made up the remaining 50%. He had a beard. Ma Biao was forced to retire and leave the battlefield with great reluctance. Ma Biao's relative Ma Bukang succeeded him as 8th Cavalry Division commander in the summer of 1942 and proceeded to battle the Japanese. Ma Biao died at age 63 due to a car accident in Xining.

This method is particularly used for solar eclipses, but is also applied for occultations of stars or planets by the Moon and transits of Venus or Mercury. In addition, for lunar eclipses a similar method is used, in which the shadow is cast on the Moon instead of the Earth. For solar eclipses, the Besselian elements are used to calculate the path of the umbra and penumbra on the Earth's surface, and hence the circumstances of the eclipse at a specific location. This method was developed in the 1820s by the German mathematician and astronomer, Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, and later improved by William Chauvenet. The basic concept is that Besselian elements describe the movement of the shadow cast by the occulting body ‚Äì for solar eclipses this is the shadow of the Moon ‚Äì on a specifically chosen plane, called the fundamental plane. This is the geocentric, normal plane of the shadow axis. In other words, it is the plane through the Earth's center that is perpendicular to the line through the centers of the occulting and the occulted bodies. One advantage, among others, of choosing this plane is that the outline of the shadow on it is always a circle, and there is no perspective distortion. Comparatively few values are needed to accurately describe the movement of the shadow on the fundamental plane. Based on this, the next step is to project the shadow cone on to the Earth's surface, taking into account the figure of the Earth, its rotation, and the observer's latitude, longitude and elevation. Although the Besselian elements determine the overall geometry of an eclipse, which longitudes on the earth's surface will experience an eclipse are determined by the earth's rotation. A variable called ŒîT measures how much that rotation has slowed over time and must also be taken into account when predicting local eclipse circumstances.  References  Further reading *Robin M.

Additionally, the culture of Idaho is reflected in the state's symbols, traditions, stories, art, and cuisine.  Ethnographic influences  Idaho is home to several immigrant groups with notable histories. Specifically, Idaho is home to significant numbers of people with historical British, Native American, German, and Mexican historical ties. The Native peoples of north Idaho are of different language backgrounds and separate from the Uto-Aztecan peoples of the Great Basin and the Shoshoni tribes of southern Idaho. Among them the Nez Perces in the Clearwater and lower Salmon River welcomed the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the early 1800s. The Spalding Missionhttps://www.nps.gov/nepe/learn/historyculture/the- spaldings-mission.htm influenced greatly the subsequent history of the people in this area. The first major influx of European-Americans in the south came from Utah, comprising Mormons who needed more land after the Salt Lake Valley became inhabited. To this day LDS churches and the Mormon culture are predominant in the daily life and customs of south-east counties. In general the popular culture of the south of the State is shared with other inland Western states that developed out of cattle and sheep ranching, the \\"cowboy culture\\" of the late 19th C. Few ethnic enclaves have developed, although Boise and its environs have more people of Basque ancestry than anywhere outside the Western Pyrenees. For the most part, people live in mixed neighborhoods and carry on ethnic customs in their homes or churches. Cultural centers in the Treasure Valley region of southern Idaho include the Hispanic Cultural Center of Idaho and the Basque Center in downtown Boise. Another cultural site is the Minidoka Relocation Camp https://www.nps.gov/miin/index.htmsite, near Hagerman, which housed many Japanese-Americans during World War II in a concentration camp, from which the small but significant population of Japanese-Americans in the Snake River Valley mostly resettled starting in 1946. Idaho takes great pride in its potato farming, mass producing 322,000 potatoes each year in the Snake River Lava Plateau. The agricultural basis of the economy influences many aspects of the local culture, politics and activities.  Geographic influences  Geography has shaped the Idahoan identity, imprinting aesthetic and recreational aspects upon the culture. For example, consider that the world's first chairlift was built in Sun Valley and that skiing is cherished as an Idaho pastime. Additionally, the rivers and high mountain lakes of Idaho contribute to a rich fishing culture within the state. The significance of Idaho's fishing culture is partly revealed by the impact of fishing recreation on the economy of Idaho. There are variations arising from geography that impact culture.

It premiered on television on 14 November 2010 on Australian channel ABC1.  Background  Sisters of War was inspired by real events and based on Rod Miller's manuscript The Lost Women of Rabaul. At the heart of those events were the stories and experiences of Lorna Johnston and Sister Berenice Twohill. In the process of clearing possessions for an estate in 1991, Miller, who is a general auctioneer, came across an old diary. He was about to throw it out when he became intrigued by the contents of the modest book. On closer inspection he saw that it was written in cryptic prose and rhyme. The diary was written by Grace Kruger, one of four civilian nurses captured by the Japanese in Rabaul in 1942. Kruger had deliberately written the diary with cryptic prose so as to confuse any Japanese soldier or casual reader who might have discovered it. Miller became fascinated by this work and the history that motivated it. Discovering there was little information readily available about the Rabaul nurses, he started to research the events surrounding their internment in Rabaul. Miller first met Sister Berenice Twohill and Lorna Johnston in 1997 and through them was able to meet and interview most of the surviving nurses and officers of Lark Force. He was able to borrow and transcribe their diaries which added to the overall knowledge of what had occurred at the time. Miller and writer John Misto joined forces on the project and soon after ABC1 came on board and producer Andrew Wiseman joined the team. Wisemen has an interest in presenting history dramas for television and Sisters of War provided a natural progression from Curtin, the World War II telemovie he produced with Richard Keddie.Background - Sisters of War - ABC TV Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The Brainerd Mission was a Christian mission to the Cherokee in present-day Chattanooga, Tennessee. The associated Brainerd Mission Cemetery is the only part that still remains, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Brainerd Mission was established in 1817 by Cyrus Kingsbury, working on behalf of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). The site was a tract on South South Chickamauga Creek, near present-day Chattanooga, previously owned by John McDonald, a former Scots trader and grandfather of John Ross, the future principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. Originally named Chickamauga Mission, it was renamed Brainerd Mission several months later, in honor of David Brainerd, an early New England Indian missionary. When the site was acquired, it contained only a dilapidated gristmill and a few other buildings. Within a short time, the missionaries, assisted by Cherokees living in the neighborhood, had added separate schoolhouses and dwellings for boys and girls, a cemetery, sawmill, blacksmith shop, wash house, meat house (smokehouse), corn house and stables. They also built a missionary residence. By the end of the year, they had also cleared and fenced about to create a farm. The aims of the mission were to provide a basic education to Cherokee children, while also instilling Christian religious values. Specifically, this included learning to read and write the English language, and to read the English bible. The missionaries also taught the girls spinning, knitting, and sewing. The boys were taught animal husbandry, farming and mechanical skills.Rozema, Vicki. \\"Rozema: The Brainerd Mission and Chattanooga history.\\" Times Free Press. March 9, 2014. Accessed April 10, 2018. Before the end of 1818, the ABCFM withdrew Cyrus Kingsbury and sent him to Mississippi as a missionary to the Choctaw Nation. Kingsbury continued serving the Choctaws for the rest of his active career. =Notable missionaries= Several prominent missionaries served at Brainerd Mission at various times; people such as Samuel Worcester, Ainsworth Blunt and Cephas Washburn. On May 27, and 28th, 1819, President James Monroe visited Brainerd Mission with General Edmund Pendleton Gaines. This was the first presidential visit to the Hamilton County area. He donated $1,000 to the work of the Mission. The mission officially closed on October 2, 1838. because of the Cherokee removal to Indian Territory. In total, the Brainerd Mission served over 300 male and female Cherokee over its 21 years of operation. It was modestly successful in reaching its stated goals, providing many of its students with a basic level of English proficiency. It was less successful in its goal of religious conversion, with only a few Cherokee joining the church. All that remains of the mission is the cemetery which is cared for by the Daughters and Sons of the American Revolution. The site of the mission itself now occupied by the Eastgate Shopping Center. The cemetery is one of the oldest in Hamilton County and consists of 60 graves, most of which are of missionary workers. The Daughters of the American Revolution were integral to the preservation of the site, and continue to own and maintain the cemetery. Notable students A relatively small number of students who had graduated from Brainerd Mission became notable figures later in life. The number includes: * Elias Boudinot, who became founder and editor of the Cherokee Phoenix, the first Cherokee newspaper; Boudinot was also a signer of the 1835 New Echota treaty. * John Ridge, son of Major Ridge and cousin of Elias Boudinot. Both Ridges were major supporters of the 1835 New Echota treaty. * David Brown (1806-1829), Cherokee clergyman who translated the New Testament into Cherokee from English, using the Sequoyah syllabary.

The town is in the Tweed Shire local government area, at the confluence of the Rous and Tweed Rivers, north east of the state capital, Sydney and south east of Brisbane. At the , Tumbulgum had a population of 349. History In the 1880s Tumbulgum was the principal town in the Tweed Valley with an active commercial sector, including a bank. It was not until construction of the rail line to Lismore in 1897 and the Murwillumbah Bridge in 1901 that Murwillumbah supplanted Tumbulgum as the major centre on the Tweed. The Australian Red Cedar growing in the Tumbulgum area attracted timber-cutters from the 1840s and by the early 1860s a small community and river port had been established on the northern side of the Tweed River where it met the Rous. The town was originally called \\"Tweed Junction\\" but in 1880 the residents petitioned to have the name changed to \\"Tumbulgum\\". This was claimed to mean \\"meeting place of the waters\\" in an Aboriginal language but others claimed translations include \\"a large fig\\" or \\"wild fig tree\\". By 1885, the town had mostly moved to the southern bank of the Tweed. There is general acceptance among our Tweed Aboriginal community of the presence of three main groups in the Tweed River Valley. These were the Goodjinburra people for the Tweed Coastal area, the Tul-gi-gin people for the North Arm (Rous), and the Moorang-Moobar people for the Southern and Central Arms around Wollumbin (Mt Warning).https://tumbulgum.wordpress.com/our-past- present-and-future/ Tumbulgum History * 31 October 1823, John Oxley discovers the Tweed River. * 1842 Cedar Getters arrive on the Tweed River. * 1866 the first land selectors arrived on the Tweed River and river port of Tweed Junction established. * 1 March 1881, name changed from Tweed Junction to Tumbulgum * 26 January 1883, Baker's Farm Auction enabled development of current village site * 24 December 1894, Murwillumbah Railway line opened.

The lake is a long reservoir of the Rio Grande that was constructed in 1954 and is a known drug smuggling route.. A turf war between rival drug cartels for control of the lake began in March 2010 and has led to a series of armed robberies and shooting incidents. All of the attacks were credited to the Los Zetas cartel and occurred primarily on the Mexican side of the reservoir but within sight of the Texas coast. The so- called pirates operate \\"fleets\\" of small boats designed to seize fisherman and smuggle drugs... While the events have been referred to colloquially as piracy, all the waters of Falcon Lake are considered either US or Mexican territorial waters and therefore are not technically piracy under Article 101 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Piracy incidents = 2010 = A turf war between the Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel began in early 2010 as part of the Mexican Drug War. The violence in and around Reynosa in March caused both civilians and Zeta cartel members to leave their homes and take refuge at Falcon Lake. Beginning in May 2010, the Zetas acquired several small skiffs, bass boats and Argos boats which they used to patrol their side of the lake for Gulf Cartel members, though they often commit other crimes such as the robbing of civilian vessels close to the shore. Some reports suggest that the Zetas commandeered boats belonging to Mexican fishermen and forced their crews to commit crimes. On April 30, 2010, five Americans in two boats were fishing on Falcon Lake at the Old Guerrero church. While there, a boat with four \\"heavily tattooed\\" men boarded the boats, demanded money and drugs. Ultimately the pirates received $200 cash before the American boats made an escape. The pirates followed the fishing boats, but the Americans got away when they crossed into United States territory.  May  On May 6, 2010 three fishermen in a boat off the north side of Salado Island were approached by a boat with two men armed with AR-15s. One of the pirates boarded the boat and searched it for drugs, money or guns. During the incident, one of the pirates chambered a round and told the fishermen that he would shoot if they did not give him money. On May 16, five armed men boarded and robbed another boat also on the American side of the lake. There has been at least three other confirmed incidents in which armed men dressed in black have boarded American boats while they were fishing just inside of Mexican waters.. In late May, a Border Patrol boat chased another boat occupied by men in ski masks but the vessel was faster than the Americans and got away. Fishermen have also reported sighting small boats loaded with Mexicans and machine guns. The pirates speak Spanish and claim to be Mexican Police officers though they have been identified by tattoos of the letter \\"Z\\" for Zeta on their arms or necks. Texas Department of Public Safety officials issued a warning for American citizens to stay on the United States side of the water and to be on the lookout for vessels used by Mexican fishermen, boats with a large prow, a small outboard motor without a cowling and no identification numbers on the hull. The warning has prevented many Texas fisherman and tourists from using the lake entirely.  August  On August 31, United States authorities released a statement saying that pirates aboard a small boat tried to intercept an American fishing boat but the operator outran the attackers and returned to the Texas side of the reservoir. On the side of the pirate boat was the misspelled words \\"Game Warden\\", written with tape. The fisherman noticed this mistake and assumed the approaching vessel to be a pirate.  September  On September 30, 2010, the most serious incident involving the pirates thus far occurred when McAllen, Texas resident and Colorado native David Hartley went missing while riding through the Mexican side of the lake on a jet ski with his wife Tiffany Hartley.. According to Tiffany's report to the Texas police, men in two small boats approached and fired on her and her husband with automatic weapons in an attempt to steal their jet skis. They then chased her back to the American side of the lake. Hartley also said that her husband was shot in the head and the pirates retrieved his body and the jet ski. Mr. Hartley's body remains missing. Both the Mexican and the United States governments launched an investigation in early October. Search and rescue teams searched the lake but no evidence was found. During the investigation, Mexican homicide detective Rolando Armando Flores Villegas of Tamaulipas was reportedly killed and his head delivered in a suitcase to the Mexican Army. The detective was one of many officers assigned to investigating the Hartley incident and he was allegedly killed only days after delivering a document to a local television station which named two of the suspected pirates. Gary Freeman, a political scientist at the University of Texas stated that \\"the beheading has such strong resonance with Islamic fundamentalism that it raises the specter of groups in Mexico being as fanatical and as bloodthirsty as Osama bin Laden and his gang. They seem to be copying some of their techniques, and that might be deliberate.\\" However, Mexican police stated they do not believe the killing to bear any relation to the Hartley case.. = 2011 = On May 8, 2011, Mexican Naval Infantry patrolling the lake discovered a camp of Zetas on an island believed to be used for smuggling marijuana into the United States by speedboat. The marines fired first and a battle began that left twelve cartel members and one marine dead. Twenty small arms were captured including assault rifles.

According to Fermat's right triangle theorem, it is not possible for all four lengths , , , and to be integers. Fermat's right triangle theorem is a non-existence proof in number theory, the only complete proof given by Pierre de Fermat.There also exists a contemporary proof by the French Academician Bernard Frenicle de Bessy. For a discussion of both Fermat and this author, see It has several equivalent formulations: *If three square numbers form an arithmetic progression, then the gap between consecutive numbers in the progression (called a congruum) cannot itself be square. *There do not exist two Pythagorean triangles in which the two legs of one triangle are the leg and hypotenuse of the other triangle. *A right triangle for which all three side lengths are rational numbers cannot have an area that is the square of a rational number. An area defined in this way is called a congruent number, so no congruent number can be square. *A right triangle and a square with equal areas cannot have all sides commensurate with each other. *The only rational points on the elliptic curve y^2=x(x-1)(x+1) are the three trivial points (0,0), (1,0), and (‚àí1,0). *The Diophantine equation x^4-y^4=z^2 has no integer solution. An immediate consequence of the last of these formulations is that Fermat's last theorem is true for the exponent n=4, and hence for any multiple of 4.  Formulation  = Squares in arithmetic progression = In 1225, Fibonacci was challenged to find a construction for triples of square numbers that are equally spaced from each other, forming an arithmetic progression, and for the spacing between these numbers, which he called a congruum. One way of describing Fibonacci's solution is that the numbers to be squared are the difference of legs, hypotenuse, and sum of legs of a Pythagorean triangle, and that the congruum is four times the area of the same triangle. In his later work on the congruum problem, published in The Book of Squares, Fibonacci observed that it is impossible for a congruum to be a square number itself, but did not present a satisfactory proof of this fact. If three squares a^2, b^2, and c^2 could form an arithmetic progression whose congruum was also a square d^2, then these numbers would satisfy the Diophantine equations :a^2 + d^2 = b^2 and b^2 + d^2 = c^2. That is, by the Pythagorean theorem, they would form two integer-sided right triangles in which the pair (d,b) gives one leg and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle and the same pair also forms the two legs of the larger triangle. But if (as Fibonacci asserted) no square congruum can exist, then there can be no two integer right triangles that share two sides in this way.The fact that there can be no two right triangles that share two of their sides, and the connection between this problem and the problem of squares in arithmetic progression, is described as \\"well known\\" by = Areas of right triangles = Because the congrua are exactly the numbers that are four times the area of a Pythagorean triangle, and multiplication by four does not change whether a number is square, the existence of a square congruum is equivalent to the existence of a Pythagorean triangle with a square area. It is this variant of the problem that Fermat's proof concerns: he shows that there is no such triangle. In considering this problem, Fermat was inspired not by Fibonacci but by an edition of Diophantus published by Claude Gaspard Bachet de M√©ziriac. This book described various special right triangles whose areas had forms related to squares, but did not consider the case of areas that were themselves square. By rearranging the equations for the two Pythagorean triangles above, and then multiplying them together, one obtains the single Diophantine equation :b^4 - d^4 = (b^2-d^2)(b^2+d^2) = a^2 c^2 which can be simplified to :b^4 - d^4 = e^2. Conversely, any solution to this equation could be factored to give a square congruum. (In particular, the squares (b^4-d^4-2b^2 d^2)^2, (b^4+d^4)^2, and (b^4-d^4+2b^2 d^2)^2 form an arithmetic progression with congruum 4b^2 d^2 (b^4-d^4) = (2bde)^2, which is a square itself.) Thus, the solvability of this equation is equivalent to the existence of a square congruum. But, if Fermat's last theorem were false for the exponent n=4, then squaring one of the three numbers in any counterexample would also give three numbers that solve this equation. Therefore, Fermat's proof that no Pythagorean triangle has a square area implies that this equation has no solution, and that this case of Fermat's last theorem is true. Another equivalent formulation of the same problem involves congruent numbers, the numbers that are areas of right triangles whose three sides are all rational numbers. By multiplying the sides by a common denominator, any congruent number may be transformed into the area of a Pythagorean triangle, from which it follows that the congruent numbers are exactly the numbers formed by multiplying a congruum by the square of a rational number. Thus, there is no square congruum if and only if the number 1 is not a congruent number. Equivalently, it is impossible for a square (the geometric shape) and a right triangle to have both equal areas and all sides commensurate with each other. = Elliptic curve = Yet another equivalent form of Fermat's theorem involves the elliptic curve consisting of the points whose Cartesian coordinates (x,y) satisfy the equation :y^2 = x(x+1)(x-1). This equation has the obvious pairs of solutions (0,0), (1,0), and (‚àí1,0). Fermat's theorem is equivalent to the statement that these are the only points on the curve for which both x and y are rational.  Fermat's proof  During his lifetime, Fermat challenged several other mathematicians to prove the non-existence of a Pythagorean triangle with square area, but did not publish the proof himself. However, he wrote a proof in his copy of Bachet's Diophantus, which his son discovered and published posthumously.For other proofs, see .; . Fermat's proof is a proof by infinite descent. It shows that, from any example of a Pythagorean triangle with square area, one can derive a smaller example. Since Pythagorean triangles have positive integer areas, and there does not exist an infinite descending sequence of positive integers, there also cannot exist a Pythagorean triangle with square area. In more detail, suppose that x, y, and z are the integer sides of a right triangle with square area. By dividing by any common factors, one can assume that this triangle is primitive and from the known form of all primitive Pythagorean triples, one can set x=2pq, y=p^2-q^2, and z=p^2+q^2, by which the problem is transformed into finding relatively prime integers p and q (one of which is even) such that pq(p^2-q^2) is square. The four linear factors p, q, p+q, and p-q are relatively prime and therefore must themselves be squares; let p+q=r^2 and p-q=s^2. Both r and s must be odd since exactly one of p or q is even and the other is odd. Therefore, both r-s and r+s are even, one of which is divisible by 4. From these two numbers Fermat derives two more numbers u=(r-s)/2 and v=(r+s)/2, one of which is even by the previous sentence. Because u^2+v^2=p is a square, u and v are the legs of another primitive Pythagorean triangle whose area (uv)/2=q/4. Since q is itself a square and since uv is even, q/4 is a square. Thus, any Pythagorean triangle with square area leads to a smaller Pythagorean triangle with square area, completing the proof.

Multiples have been called the most accessible and reasonably priced contemporary art on the market, value for money. They could be multiples of a 2D print, 3D sculpture or installation piece. The multiple offers artists a way of selling work without compromising their artistic integrity and makes their work accessible to a wider market. Multiples are united by their lack of uniqueness, usually regarded as a prerequisite in a work of art. Many are by artists who work solely with the concept of the multiple. The challenge to the artist is in finding ways of realizing an idea that can be repeated time and again. Thus part of the creative challenge comes in researching new methods and sourcing new materials, leading to some unlikely collaborations between artist and fabricators. History Multiples are not a new idea. Many artists in the 20th century tinkered with the concept. Spurred on by Marcel Duchamp's ready- mades, the multiple became a subversive art-form. Hand-made, limited edition books were around long before that - William Morris and Walter Crane were using mass production methods to take art to the masses true to their socialist ideals in the 19th century. Marcel Duchamp is a forebear of multiples as they are known today. His ready-mades elevated everyday objects to works of art by the act of signing them. His 1935 work Rotoreliefs, a set of six rotating optical discs, which were issued in an edition of 500 is one of the first true artists' multiples. Joseph Beuys (1921‚Äì1986) took the multiple idea further. Disillusioned by the approach to everyday objects manifested by Fluxus, Beuys wanted to reclaim the role of the object as art. He felt that as an artist he could channel energy from everyday objects and imbue them with new power and meaning. Wolf Vostells first multiple Do it yourself was published in 1963 to go with his show at the Smolin Gallery.Wolf Vostell. Retrospektive 92, Edition Braus, Heidelberg 1992, . In 1993, artists Sarah Lucas and Tracey Emin took over a disused shop in London's East End and, with other artists friends including Damien Hirst, sold T-shirts, mugs and other customized items as works of art. This artist-led approach to selling art directly to the public not only re-popularised the artists multiple, but was a key moment in the subsequent Young British Artist era, culminating in the Charles Saatchi collected \\"Sensation\\" exhibition. Since 2005, there have been vending machines produced by the association Un Certain D√©tachement from Grenoble, France. The association was founded by artists Mary Veale, Claude Gazengel and Alain Quercia in 2005. There have been 40 contemporary artists making multiples in video, books, sculpture, design etc. All are works are individually signed and numbered and displayed in shows throughout France, including the 2011 Biennale d'art contemporain de Lyon. Consumer protection laws California became the first state to regulate the sale of artist's multiples and limited edition art prints with the \\"California Print Law\\" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the \\"Georgia Print Law\\". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states. The Georgia Print Law written by (former) State Representative Chesley V. Morton, became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more that $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law. The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser's remedies are extinguished. A limited edition is normally hand signed and numbered by the artist, typically in pencil, in the form (e.g.): 14/100. The first number is the number of the print itself. The second number is the number of overall prints the artist will print of that image. The lower the second number is, the more valuable and collectible the limited editions are likely to be, within whatever their price range is. A small number of \\"artists' proofs\\" may also be produced as well, signed and with \\"AP\\", \\"proof\\", etc. Prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked \\"H. C.\\" or \\"H/C\\", meaning \\"hors de commerce\\", not for sale.

The pond, arboretum, and botanic garden are all within the city of Arcadia. The pond is fed by stormwater and natural springs; water flows out of the pond to the aquifer at Raymond Fault, and on to the Rio Hondo. Baldwin Lake is part of the Los Angeles River watershed. The area of the pond is about . Silt and pollutants embedded in the pond by surface runoff have reduced its depth from about to . History For hundreds of years before the Spanish colonization of Alta California displaced them in the late 18th century, Tongva people lived near the pond in a settlement called Alyeupkigna. The Spanish forced the Tongva to move to a reduction at the Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel. At the site of the Tongva settlement, the Spanish established Alyeupkigna Rancheria in 1800, as an agricultural outpost of the mission. The Hugo Reid Adobe was built by Scottish‚àíMexican Hugo Reid on the shore of the pond in 1840. Reid received the full Mexican land grant for Rancho Santa Anita in 1845, with included 'Baldwin Lake' and numerous other artesian sag ponds and springs within its 3 square leagues (13,319 acres). Elias Jackson ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù Baldwin purchased Rancho Santa Anita in 1875. Baldwin Lake served as a holding reservoir for ranch irrigation projects. It was dredged and deepened, perhaps by , by Baldwin in the late 1880s, and a retaining wall capped by granite boulders was built around the shoreline. Baldwin built the elaborate Coach Barn near the pond in 1879, and the Queen Anne style 'Baldwin‚Äôs Belvedere' or Santa Anita Ranch Guest Cottage on a peninsula surrounded by the waters in 1885‚àí1886. The Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and California Historical Landmarks. The Reid-Baldwin Adobe, remodeled and enlarged by Lucky Baldwin into his main ranch residence, is a California Historical Landmark. In 1947 the state and county acquired the land to create an arboretum around the pond and historic Baldwin structures.

A few elemental metals are liquid at or near room temperature. The most well known is mercury (Hg), which is molten above ‚àí38.8 ¬∞C (234.3 K, ‚àí37.9 ¬∞F). Others include caesium(Cs), which has a melting point of 28.5 ¬∞C (83.3 ¬∞F), rubidium (Rb)(39 ¬∞C [102 ¬∞F]), francium (Fr)(estimated at 8.0 ¬∞C [46 ¬∞F]), and gallium (Ga)(30 ¬∞C [86 ¬∞F]). Alloys can be liquid if they form a eutectic, meaning that the alloy's melting point is lower than any of the alloy's constituent metals. The standard metal for creating liquid alloys used to be mercury, but gallium-based alloys, which are lower both in their vapor pressure at room temperature and toxicity, are being used as a replacement in various applications.Thermal Interface Materials  Thermal and electrical conductivity  Alloy systems that are liquid at room temperature have thermal conductivity far superior to ordinary non-metallic liquids, allowing liquid metal to efficiently transfer energy from the heat source to the liquid. They also have a higher electrical conductivity that allows the liquid to be pumped by more efficient, electromagnetic pumps. This results in the use of these materials for specific heat conducting and/or dissipation applications. Another advantage of liquid alloy systems is their inherent high densities.  Viscosity  The viscosity of liquid metals can vary greatly depending on the atomic composition of the liquid, especially in the case of alloys. In particular, the temperature dependence of the viscosity of liquid metals may range from the standard Arrhenius law dependence, to a much steeper (non- Arrhenius) dependence such as that given empirically by the Vogel-Fulcher- Tammann equation. A physical model for the viscosity of liquid metals, which captures this great variability in terms of the underlying interatomic interactions, was also developed. The electrical resistance of a liquid metal can be estimated by means of the Ziman formula, which gives the resistance in terms of the static structure factor of the liquid as can be determined by neutron or X-ray scattering measurements.  Wetting to metallic and non- metallic surfaces  Once oxides have been removed from the substrate surface, most liquid metals will wet most metallic surfaces. At room-temperature liquid metals are often reactive and soluble to metallic surfaces, though some solid metals are resistant to attack by the common liquid metals. For example gallium is corrosive to all metals except tungsten and tantalum, which have a high resistance to corrosion, more so than niobium, titanium and molybdenum. Similar to indium, gallium and gallium-containing alloys have the ability to wet to many non-metallic surfaces such as glass and quartz. Gently rubbing the alloy into the surface may help induce wetting. However, this observation of \\"wetting by rubbing into glass surface\\" has created a widely spread misconception that the gallium-based liquid metals wet glass surfaces, as if the liquid breaks free of the oxide skin and wets the surface. The reality is the opposite: the oxide makes the liquid wet the glass. In more details: as the liquid is rubbed into and spread onto the glass surface, the liquid oxidizes and coats the glass with a thin layer of oxide (solid) residues, on which the liquid metal wets. In other words, what is seen is a gallium-based liquid metal wetting its solid oxide, not glass. Apparently, the above misconception was caused by the super-fast oxidation of the liquid gallium in even a trace amount of oxygen, i.e., nobody observed the true behavior of a liquid gallium on glass, until research at the UCLA debunked the above myth by testing Galinstan, a gallium-based alloy that is liquid at room temperature, in an oxygen-free environment. Note: These alloys form a thin dull looking oxide skin that is easily dispersed with mild agitation. The oxide-free surfaces are bright and lustrous.  Applications  Because of their excellent characteristics and manufacturing methods, liquid metals are often used in wearable devices, medical devices, interconnected devices and so on. Typical uses of liquid metals include thermostats, switches, barometers, heat transfer systems, and thermal cooling and heating designs.Liquid Metal Thermal Interface Materials Uniquely, they can be used to conduct heat and/or electricity between non-metallic and metallic surfaces. =Thermal interfaces= Liquid metal is sometimes used as a thermal interface material between coolers and processors because of its high thermal conductivity. =3D printing devices= Liquid metal can be used for wearable devices. Emerging IoT applications require reliable and effective wireless connectivity. Therefore, it is necessary to make a small flexible antenna.

Seelyhoo were fronted by songwriter, vocalist and tin whistle player Fiona Mackenzie. Their music has been described as belonging to the traditional side of the progressive Celtic music movement, and Mackenzie's voice has been compared to that of Capercaillie's Karen Matheson. The band toured in Great Britain and continental Europe. Seelyhoo's played traditional folk songs, as well as new songs written by Mackenzie, Jennifer Wrigley, Hazel Wrigley, and Sandy Brechin.

To the south Nungwi shares a border with the neighboring Matemwe- and Tazari villages. Nungwi was traditionally a fishing village and dhow-building center, but is now a popular tourist destination, and for instance recognized in CNN‚Äôs list of \\"100 best beaches of the world\\" in 2014.Briggs, Philip (2009).

Until the 1990s, the local population was opposed to tourism. Nungwi's beach is one of the last in the area to host hotels and other touristic structures, but has however, in recent years emerged as the most visited tourist destination in Zanzibar.Briggs, Philip (2006).

The recent increase in tourism has been due to its coast and beaches lined with palm, mangrove, and casuarina trees, as well as the good snorkeling and scuba diving. The main beach of Nungwi is nicknamed \\"Jambo Square\\". A small aquarium with sea turtles has also recently been created in the village. Besides tourism and fishing, agriculture constitutes a smaller portion of the economic activity. Farmers cultivate lentils, corn, beans, and cassava.Pfeifer, Kimberly 2000).
