The Viscount crashed in a wood 3 miles (4.8 km) from the threshold of Gatwick runway during its final approach to land in extensive fog. Five of the eight crew and nine of the 16 passengers died in the crash. The prime minister was among the ten survivors. Flight Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, accompanied by a Turkish delegation, was on his way to the British capital to sign the London Agreement on the Cyprus issue with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Greek Prime Minister Constantine Karamanlis, which gave the three sides the right to intervene in Cyprus in case peace was broken by any of the parties. The special flight departed from Ankara Esenboğa International Airport bound for London Heathrow Airport via Istanbul Atatürk International Airport and Rome Ciampino Airport . The aircraft left its last stopover, Rome, at 13:02 hrs and called London Airways at 15:56 hrs over Abbeville, just before leaving French airspace. TC-SEV was cleared by air traffic control to the Epsom Radio Range station, the holding fix for London Airport. Over Epsom range at 16:21 hrs, the Turkish Airlines captain was instructed by the London Airport Commandant to divert to Gatwick due to poor visibility at Heathrow. Accident TC-SEV, cruising at , left Epsom at 16:27 hrs for Mayfield, East Sussex, the holding point for Gatwick. The airport's approach control informed the pilot that it would be positioned by radar for an ILS approach to the easterly Runway 09. The latest actual weather conditions observed at Gatwick Airport were surface wind calm, visibility , mist, no low cloud, and shallow ground fog patches of only to in depth. The weather reported to the aircraft was \\"surface wind calm, visibility one decimal one nautical miles, mist, three oktas at eight hundred feet, the QFE one zero three six\\", which was acknowledged by the pilot. At 16:34 hrs, the pilot was instructed to descend to a holding pattern at on reaching Mayfield NDB and to steer a course of 280 degrees and then to continue to descend to . Turned on to the ILS approach path, TC-SEV overshot the centre line slightly. At from touchdown, the aircraft affirmed that it could continue on the ILS. At 16:38 hrs, the captain was requested a change to tower frequency and this was acknowledged. It was the last communication with the aircraft. The aircraft was visible along the approach path centre line on the radar screen towards the runway until it disappeared about from the threshold. It was assumed that the aircraft had crashed since no reply was received to radio calls to the aircraft. The aircraft had flown into the top of trees AMSL at the edge of Jordan's Wood east of the Newdigate-Rusper roadThe Gatwick Accident on a heading parallel to the approach path to Runway 09 at Gatwick. The aircraft lost its wings and had its engines torn off as it descended at an angle of about 6 degrees from the horizontal through the woods, and touched the ground with its wheels. After rising again slightly the main part of the wreckage landed upside down with trees embedded in the mangled fuselage about further on, after which it caught fire. The rear part of the fuselage came to rest upside down and remained untouched by fire. Shortly after, an explosion occurred in the main fuselage. The accident site was located from the runway threshold and to the north of the approach path centre line. This was the first air disaster in which Turkish Airlines was involved. Rescue operations Gatwick Airport alerted the local fire and rescue services, and soon it was confirmed that the aircraft had crashed in the area in which it had disappeared from the radar screen. Peter Weller, a gardener at the Newdigate Chaffold farm, and his two colleagues noticed the crash. He asked one of his friends to ride on a bike to the next police station to report the accident. He and his other friend rushed to the scene and tried to rescue the victims. Shortly after 17:00 hrs another local resident, Margaret Bailey, who was a trained nurse, and her husband Tony were at the crash site. The resulting fire was put out by three divisions of Surrey Fire Brigade, despite thick fog. Turkish prime minister's survival The memorial to the victims in the Turkish Airforce plot at Brookwood Cemetery The survivors were screaming as they tried to leave the wreckage. Turkish Premier Adnan Menderes, who was seated at a left window seat in the rear passenger cabin, survived the crash with only light scratches to his face, hanging in an upside-down position with his foot stuck in the floor. He was helped by Rıfat Kadıoğlu, who freed his foot and unbuckled his safety belt. He was then taken out of the wreckage by Kadıoğlu and Şefik Fenmen. Another survivor, Melih Esenbel, joined the group outside. Menderes sat in shock witnessing his company burn.Newspaper Radikal 12 January 2003 While Tony Bailey was engaged in helping the other victims, his wife took Menderes and two other survivors by car to her farmhouse away and gave first aid.Accident on Araştıralım website 15 June 2006 Menderes was transferred to The London Clinic 90 minutes later. He signed the London Agreement on 19 February 1959, in the hospital. He returned home on 26 February 1959, and was welcomed by his archrival İsmet İnönü and a huge crowd. Other casualties were treated at hospitals in East Grinstead, Redhill and Dorking. The bodies of the victims were transferred to Turkey and buried on 22 February 1959. A memorial to the victims is located in the Turkish Airforce plot at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. Crash investigation The following facts were ascertained: The investigation concluded that: An aftercast of the probable weather conditions on the approach to Gatwick from west to the threshold of Runway 09 was surface wind calm or light westerly and the ground almost entirely covered with fog from the western limit of the area under consideration to about - from the threshold of runway. The top of the fog was about to and the visibility within it varied from about to possible with few transient isolated breaks. From the eastern edge of the fog belt to Gatwick, there was mist and haze with visibility - and little or no low cloud. Aircraft Vickers Viscount painted in THY livery for a movie. The aircraft, a Vickers Viscount Type 793 with four Rolls-Royce Dart 510 turboprop engines, was built by Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd and completed in 1958 with serial number 429. A United Kingdom Certificate of Airworthiness was issued on 25 July 1958, valid for one year, and a Certificate of Validation for the same period was issued by the Civil Aviation Department of the Turkish Ministry of Communications. The aircraft was registered in the name of Turkish Airlines Incorporated. The airframe had a total flight time of 548 hours and the engines had each run approximately 615 hours since manufacture. The Turkish authorities certified after examining the appropriate records and log books in Turkey that the maintenance had been properly carried out. Examination of the translated extracts from these documents showed no record of any defect, which might have affected the accident. It was noted that no inspections of the ILS equipment in the aircraft had been carried out. At the time of the accident, the weight of the aircraft was below the permissible maximum for landing. It was not possible to check the trim but there was no reason to believe that it was not within the prescribed limits.

It connected the Sendaidō's terminus at Sendai Castle with the northern tip of modern-day Aomori Prefecture. It was established by Tokugawa Ieyasu for government officials traveling through the area. The route is named after the Matsumae Domain, the only Edo period feudal domain to have been located in Ezo (now called Hokkaidō); Matsumae was accessible by boat from the northern terminus of the Matsumaedō. Travel In the early Edo period, travel along the road mostly consisted of daimyō and their retainers heading to-and-from Edo under their sankin kōtai obligations. After Hakodate's development, the late Edo period saw travel further increase as a result of increasing trade with Imperial Russia. Today, the path of the Ōshū Kaidō is followed by National Route 4, which runs parallel to the Tōhoku Expressway and the Hachinohe Expressway.

Retrieved February 17, 2016 History In the struggle of the Saracens against the Normans for the possession of Sicily, Mazara was hotly contested, especially in 1075 when Roger I of Sicily emerged victorious. The area had previously been the Diocese of Lilybaeum, but this was not reestablished and instead a new see established at Mazzara. Of the bishops of Lilybaeum the best known is Paschasinus, legate of Pope Leo I at the Council of Chalcedon (451). He had previously been invited to the Roman synod of 447 by Leo I.Lanzoni, pp. 642-644. P. Jaffé, Regesta pontificum Romanorum Tomus I, edition altera (Leipzig: Veit 1885), p. 61, nos. 414-415. In 1093 Count Roger granted the territories forming the diocese of Mazara to Bishop Stephen and his successors, with permission of Pope Urban II. The privileges were confirmed by Pope Paschal II in a bull of 15 October 1100.Pirro, II, pp. 840-842. Gams, p. 948. The first bishop of Mazara (1093) was Stefano de Ferro, a relative of Count Roger. The cathedral was then founded, and later embellished by Bishop Tustino (1157–1180). In 1742 the town of Mazara had approximately 6000 citizens. The Cathedral, dedicated to the Holy Savior, had a Chapter composed of four dignities and eighteen Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 282 note 1. The dignities are: the Cantor, the Archdeacon, the Dean, and the Treasurer. The right of appointment of the Cantor belongs to the Pope. The appointment of the other dignities and the Canons belongs to the Pope, if the vacancy occurs between January and June, and to the Bishop if the vacancy occurs between July and December.

Gams, p. 948 (1093 – ca. 1125) *Ubertus *Tustinus (Tristanus)Tustinus, or Tristinus, or Justinus, apparently subscribed a document: Ego Tustinus, Dei gratia Mazarensis qui et Lilybitanus. In 1157 he subscribed a grant of King William I of Sicily (1154–1166). He was a friend and Councilor of William II (1166–1189). In October 1176, at the request of William II and with the consent of the Chapter of Marzara, Tustin ceded the town(s) of Giati and Calatrasi to the Abbot of Monreale and new Bishop, Theobald. In 1177 he attended the coronation of Queen Joanna, daughter of Henry II of England. The name Tustinus Episcopus appears on the new pulpit of the cathedral. He died on 23 October 1180.

He assisted the notorious outlaw Aime du Poncet during his painfully protracted execution, and it is said that Poncet died penitent and resigned. This striking conversion made a profound impression.

After the Nazis came to national power, in 1934 he joined the uniformed Protection Police (Schutzpolizei) with the rank of captain. In 1936, Schimana was transferred to the Gendarmerie as a major. After the Anschluss, he was transferred to the Police Headquarters at Vienna as Commander of the motorized Gendarmerie for Austria. On 15 August 1939, he joined the SS with the rank of Standartenführer. At the outbreak of the war in Europe, he took over command of a field gendarmerie battalion in Poland, France then General Government (Poland) up to 1940.

Entrainment in the biomusicological sense refers to the synchronization (e.g. foot tapping) of organisms to an external perceived rhythm such as human music and dance. Humans are the only species for which all individuals experience entrainment, although there are documented examples of entrained nonhuman individuals. Beat induction Beat induction is the process in which a regular isochronous pulse is activated while one listens to music (i.e. the beat to which one would tap one's foot). It was thought that the cognitive mechanism that allows us to infer a beat from a sound pattern, and to synchronize or dance to it, was uniquely human. No primate tested so far—with exception of the human species—can dance or collaboratively clap to the beat of the music. Humans know when to start, when to stop, when to speed up or to slow down, in synchronizing with their fellow dancers or musicians. Although primates do not appear to display beat induction, some parrots do. The most famous example, Snowball was shown to display genuine dance, including changing his movements to a change in tempo (Patel et al., 2009) Beat induction can be seen as a fundamental cognitive skill that allows for music (e.g., Patel, 2008; Honing, 2007; 2012). We can hear a pulse in a rhythmic pattern while it might not even be explicitly in there: The pulse is being induced (hence the name) while listening—like a perspective can be induced by looking at an arrangement of objects in a picture. Neuroscientist Ani Patel proposes beat induction—referring to it as \\"beat-based rhythm processing\\"—as a key area in music-language research, suggesting beat induction \\"a fundamental aspect of music cognition that is not a byproduct of cognitive mechanisms that also serve other, more clearly adaptive, domains (e.g. auditory scene analysis or language)\\" (Patel, 2008). Evolutionary function Joseph Jordania recently suggested that the human ability to be entrained was developed by the forces of natural selection as an important part of achieving the specific altered state of consciousness, battle trance.Joseph Jordania. Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution. Logos, 2011 Achieving this state, in which humans lose their individuality, do not feel fear and pain, are united in a shared collective identity, and act in the best interests of the group, was crucial for the physical survival of our ancestors against the big African predators, after hominids descended from the safer trees to the dangerous ground and became terrestrial.

A keen lepidopterist he corresponded with Philipp Christoph Zeller. In 1863 Schmeltz became \\"Kustos\\" or senior curator of the Museum Godeffroy in Hamburg, which specialised in the natural history and ethnography of the South Seas. The museum was described in Dutch, Danish, German, English, and Austrian scientific journals as one of the best collections of its kind.

After being sent back he had to fill it into the collection. He remained in this post after suspension of payment of J. C Godeffroy & Sohn in December 1879.

It is classified as a member of the Shina language cluster within the Dardic subgroup. It is spoken in the village of Sau, on the east bank of the Kunar River, around south of the town of Arandu, which is on the border with Pakistan's Chitral region. Sawi speakers consider themselves part of the Gawar ethnic group, which is found in half a dozen of the surrounding villages and whose language is Gawarbati. In communicating with them, the people of Sau reportedly resort to using Pashto. During the long period of unrest, the population of the village was displaced into refugee camps in Chitral and Dir, but reportedly many people have now returned to Afghanistan.  History  The closest relative of the Sawi language is the southern variety of Palula spoken in Ashret further up the Kunar Valley in Chitral. Many Sawi speakers are aware of the similarity between the two languages, and some consider the people of Ashret as their \\"brothers\\". Henrik Liljegren's study of the shared linguistic features and the local oral traditions suggest that the ancestors of these language communities are likely to have migrated from the present-day Diamer District on the Indus River. There was probably an early split between Northern and Southern Palula, with Sawi subsequently branching off from the latter. The current similarity between the two varieties of Palula is then explained as a result of convergence.  Grammar  The presence of weak voiced aspirates () was cautiously reported by Buddruss in 1967, but found them to be absent from the speech of his consultant(s). It is likely that the loss of aspiration in the ancestor language could have been related to the development of a tone system.. Cf. the analysis of Kolkati in Possibly under the influence of Gawarbati, Sawi has developed a voiceless lateral fricative ' out of the *tr consonant clusters of the earlier language, compare for example Sawi ɬo with Southern Palula tróo 'three'. Unlike the main Shina varieties, where the past and present tense are typically marked for person, Sawi and Palula verb tenses are almost entirely participle-based, with only traces of agreement for person. Like Torwali, Sawi has grammaticalised the category of animacy in its nominal morphology. The agent suffix is -e for perfective transitive verbs. Unlike the main Shina varieties, Sawi does not seem to possess an agent suffix for imperfective transitive verbs.

History  It was first mentioned in a document of Bishop of Wrocław issued on 23 May 1223 for Norbertine Sisters in Rybnik among villages paying them a tithe, as Beleuisco/ (Beloviezo). Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz and the Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Teschen, ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skoczów. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the village grew from 235 in 1880 to 283 in 1910, with majority of the inhabitants being native Polish-speakers (98.7%-100%) of Catholic faith (99% in 1910). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After the World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and division of Cieszyn Silesia, the village became a part of the Second Polish Republic.

The Spanish Forger's works were painted on vellum or parchment leaves of genuine medieval books, using either blank margins or scraping off the original writing. He also \\"completed\\" unfinished miniatures or added missing miniatures in medieval choir books. His works fooled many experts and collectors at the time and appear today in the collections of many museums and libraries. Over 200 forgeries have been identified.William Voelkle, assisted by Roger S. Wieck, The Spanish Forger, New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, 1978 (containing a catalog of known forgeries, with many images).Auction results: 227 forgeries have been found. As recently as 1930, the Forger was believed to be of Spanish origin. This is due to the fact that one of his first identified forgeries was attributed as a genuine work by Jorge Inglés, a Spanish artist who was active during the 15th century. However, when one considers the provenance of the Forger’s pieces along with many of the medieval collectible miniatures of the period, Paris was the center of purchasing, selling, and forging. A number of his forged miniatures have been identified as copied, with modifications, from those published in several French books dating to the 1870s −1880s. His works were very deceptive when created, but over time it has been recognized that the faces of individuals in his pictures have \\"sugary expressions\\" inconsistent with genuine medieval illuminations.Otto Kurz, Fakes, New York,1948, p. 90. Some of his miniatures have also been identified as forgeries because they are of secular scenes that would not have appeared in genuine medieval religious texts. Additionally, many of the individuals in the Spanish Forger’s miniatures have a tilt to their heads that would not be present in authentic medieval works. In the \\"Knights of the Crusade\\" miniature, the bearded knight at the gate and the maiden in the bottom embellishment exhibit the classic head tilt. Also, the facial expressions on most of the subjects in his miniatures are sweet and cloying, not pious and pensive as with true works. In legitimate medieval works, gold leaf was added first so that the paints would not be obscured by it. However, the Spanish Forger used gold leaf as a final touch, obscuring his paints and giving a lustrous appearance to his forgeries. Up to a certain point, most of the Spanish Forger’s miniatures had been identified due to unique stylistic characteristics. In 2009, Lucia Burgio, Robin Clark, and Richard Hark performed spectroscopic investigation, comprehensive analysis of pigments by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence, upon five of the Spanish Forger’s miniatures in order to determine with scientific certainty that the forgeries were exactly that. Use of the pigments ultramarine blue (first synthesized after 1828) and Scheele’s green (synthesized after 1775) were discovered, providing solid evidence that the Forger’s imitations were fabricated in post- medieval period. The Spanish Forger’s works were the subject of an exhibition at the Morgan Library in New York City in 1978, for which an extensive catalog was published.Willam Voelkle, supra. His works are now themselves collected as forgeries, selling for several thousand dollars each. He circulated over 194 imitations, which have been identified, around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to multiple collectors of medieval art. In January 2009, it was announced that the Victoria and Albert Museum purposely acquired five examples of the Spanish Forger's work for their collection \\"for what it tells us about late 19th-century perceptions.\\" The museum took the works in lieu of £20,000 ($US 30,000) of inheritance tax, equivalent to a value per work of about $6,000. Another of the artist's paintings appeared on an episode of the Antiques Roadshow in 2014, being valued at around $4,000.

History  Overcrowding of the city's only high school led the city to build a new high school on the west side of the newly enlarged city. Built in 1960 at 11100 West Center Street and opened in 1961, it was called Wauwatosa West High School. The original high school was renamed Wauwatosa East. Because the Longfellow and Hawthorne Junior High Schools were also overcrowded, another school was built in 1969 just west of this building at 11400 West Center Street. When the new building opened, it became Wauwatosa West High School, and the previous building became Whitman Junior High School. Originally scheduled for completion in 1970, a fire damaged part of the building during construction, delaying its opening until 1971. In 1993, an associate principal was shot and killed by a 21-year-old former student.  Enrollment  As of the 2017-18 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,152 students and 68.4 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 16.9:1. There were 169 students (14.7% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 29 (2.5% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.School data for East High, National Center for Education Statistics.

Story Wizards is a game of high fantasy in the \\"Enchanted Isles\\" for 2-5 players. The players each take the role of a druid, a wizard, or a sorcerer (who get their power from the dragons), and they must work together against the \\"Evil Spirit\\". It is both a co-operative game and a competitive game: If the players together are unable to thwart the Evil Spirit, everyone loses; but if one player is able to complete enough \\"Tasks\\" and collect the \\"Sacred Gems\\" in time, that player alone wins the game. Gameplay The board represents the sea. Eighteen equally-sized hexagonal islands are placed randomly on the board. Each player tries to advance his or her character through four levels of power by completing quests (called \\"Tasks\\"), which involves travelling to several different islands. Each game turn represents a day; if the players collectively have not completed ten tasks at the end of fourteen days, then the Evil Spirit attacks the islands, which usually choosing one of the islands at random and turning it over, removing it from play. Any quests that required travel to that island are now impossible to complete. If one particular tile, the Sacred Circle, is removed, the game is lost. Players who have advanced their characters to fourth level no longer need to complete tasks, but instead start collecting Sacred Gems from six High Wizards. There is also a False Wizard, who works against the players. If a player can collect the six different gems without having them stolen by the False Wizard, the player can move toward the center of the Sacred Circle. If he reaches that goal, Rüktal the Druid High Priest, can cast the Spell of Spells to defeat the Evil Spirit, and the player wins the game. The game components are a hex board representing the sea, eighteen island tiles, markers for the five wizards, and counters for boats and other objects, and turn markers. Reception In the September 1983 issue of White Dwarf, Jim Bambra admired the artwork and the language of the rules, saying, \\"The beautiful artwork in pastel shades on the box cover is mirrored by the Beautiful and Exotic language of the Rulebook.\\" However, Bambra found issues with the number of unusual rules, which he felt hindered play. \\"The Rules are not easy to understand, because there are so many special cases which overrule the norms.\\" Bambra gave the game an overall score of 7 out of 10, saying, \\"In terms of enjoyment...

Luigi Tosti Life His father, Count Giovanni Tosti, descended from an ancient Calabrian family, died young, and so his mother, Vittoria Corigliano, entrusted the child to its uncle, a monk at Monte Cassino. In 1819 Tosti because a pupil at the abbey, and was drawn early towards the monastic life. He was sent to Rome to complete his studies, was ordained priest in 1833, and soon returned to Monte Cassino, where for twenty years he taught the doctrines of Aquinas. About 1829 he had begun a deep study of history, and in 1842 he published his Storia della badia di Monte Cassino, soon followed by the Storia di Bonifazio VIII (History of Pope Boniface VIII). His Storia della Lega Lombarda (History of the Lombard League), dedicated to Pius IX, appeared in 1848 and was a trumpet-call to the Neo-Guelph party. He worked so hard that in 1851 he published the Storia di Abelardo e dei suoi tempi, the Storia del Concilio di Constanze (History of the Council of Constance) in 1853, the Storia dell' origine dello scisma greco in 1856, La Contessa Matilde e i Romani pontefici in 1859, and in 1861 the Prolegomeni alla storia universale della Chiesa. Tosti took part in the nationalist movement blessed by Pius IX. In 1844 he had planned a review, L'Ateneo italiano, for the purpose of raising the papacy to the head of his Risorgimento. The Neapolitan police authorities opposed the idea. They forbade Tosti to engage in the projected mediation between pope and triumvirs of the ephemeral Roman Republic; this mediation was being advocated by the French envoy, Comte d'Harcourt. Pius IX intervened personally to secure the liberation of the imprisoned Tosti, who, as Cardinal Alfonso Capecelatro relates, had been accused of belonging to a band of murderous conspirators. William Temple, the English ambassador at Naples, also opposed his imprisonment. Tosti sought consolation in the study of the Holy Scriptures and his book, Ricordi biblici, was the fruit of this experience. He was sad to see convents threatened by a law of expropriation passed by the Parliament of the new Italian Kingdom and appealed to distinguished friends, such as the British statesman, William Gladstone, to obtain some exemption for Monte Cassino, which he likewise procured later for the Abbey of Grottaferrata, the Sacro Speco of Subiaco, etc. Pained by these events, Tosti refused a chair in the University of Pisa, but later became assistant archivist of the Vatican, under Leo XIII. This pope's allocution in May, 1887, inviting the Italian Government to make peace, presided over by the former revolutionary, Francesco Crispi, rekindled Tosti's patriotism. Deputed by the pope to negotiate the restoration of St. Paul's to the Benedictines, Tosti hoped to effect an official reconciliation of the Vatican and the Quirinale. Crispi's impatience, mutual opposition, and the distrusts of French diplomats, thwarted his efforts, and he had to retract publicly his brochure La conciliazione. He withdrew to Monte Cassino and undertook his Della vita di S. Benedetto (Of the Life of St Benedict). Moved by the pope's appeal to the English in 1896, he renewed his efforts with Gladstone, in favour of a reunion of the Churches.

From the time of the Norman Conquest it was established as a royal hunting reserve, administered by William Peverel, a follower of William I, who was based at Peveril Castle. The Royal Forest of Peak was bounded by the River Goyt to the west, the River Wye to the South, the River Derwent to the east and the River Etherow to the north. In 1305 it covered about 100 square miles. The south western area between the River Wye and Kinder Scout was relatively open country, which was enclosed by a low wall, sufficient to keep out cattle and sheep but allow the deer to roam. The area was known as Campana,Champaign, or \\"open country\\". the other two being Hopedale and Longdendale. The point where they met is to this day marked by Edale Cross. As well as his custodianship of the Forest, William also held a number of manors that formed part of what was recorded in the Domesday Survey as the Honour of Peverel. His son, also William, was granted a number of further manors, such that the Peverels could regard it as their demesne, apart from the manors of Muchedeswell and Tickhill which belonged to Henry de Ferrers. However, in 1154 the estate was confiscated by King Henry II who rebuilt Peveril Castle in 1176. In 1189 Richard I gave the honour of the Peak to John the Count of Mortain. Later Edward II bestowed it briefly to his favourite Piers de Gaveston and then under Edward II it passed in 1345 to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. John died in 1347 and it passed to Edward's wife Philippa of Hainault. Finally in 1372 it was granted to John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. When his son Henry IV ascended the throne the Honour of the Peak passed to the crown along with all the other holdings of the Duchy of Lancaster, such as Duffield Frith. Subsequently, the manor and forest of High Peak were leased in perpetuity to the dukes of Devonshire. Records document the deer, wild pigs, wolves, horses and sheep in the forest. Anyone caught breaking the laws of the forest was taken to the Peak Castle at Castleton, from where the High Steward administered the forest. The present village of Peak Forest is at the heart of the area of the old royal forest and was formerly known as Chamber of Campana. The nearby Chamber Farm or Chamber Knoll may have been the exact location of the residence and meeting place of local forest officials. Notes References Turbutt, G., (1999) A History of Derbyshire.

The name of both the river and the village is derived from loam (Polish: ił, adjective: iłowy).  History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Gylownita. It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay a tithe from was not yet precised). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village with Kisielów was bought from Karl Freyherrn von Celesta by Teschener Kammer in 1792 for 120,000 florins. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielitz (Bielsko) and the legal district of Schwarzwasser (Strumień). According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 707 in 1880 to 744 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (99.1%-99.9%) accompanied by a few German-speaking people (at most 7 or 0.9% in 1910), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (97%), followed by Protestants (22 or 3%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland. In the years 2005-2011 a John Paul II church was built in the village, a filial church of Rudzica.

He played hurling with his local club Kinnitty and with the Offaly senior inter-county team in the 1970s and 1980s. Playing career =Club= Flaherty played his club hurling with his local club Kinnitty and enjoyed much success. His skill at the game became apparent from as early as 1957 when he won his first juvenile hurling medal with the club. Flaherty made his senior debut for the club at the age of seventeen, as well as playing at minor and under-21 levels. In 1966 he won a county junior title with the club before going on to win senior county titles in 1967, 1978, 1979, 1983, 1984 and 1985. =Inter-county= Flaherty first came to prominence on the inter- county scene as a member of the Offaly minor and under-21 teams. He had little success in either of these grades and he quickly joined the county senior team. Flaherty emigrated to the United States at the start of the 1970s; however, when he returned he resumed his place on the Offaly senior team. Things were on the up for the Offaly hurlers in the late 1970s; however, the big breakthrough was yet to come. All this changed in 1980 when Flaherty’s team defeated reigning All-Ireland champions Kilkenny in the Leinster final. It was the first time that Offaly had captured the provincial title and it gave Flaherty his first Leinster medal. It was a remarkable turnaround for a team that had no hurling tradition. Unfortunately Offaly's dream season came to an end at the hands of Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1981 Offaly retained their provincial crown and Flaherty added a second Leinster medal to his collection. This victory allowed Offaly to advance directly to the All- Ireland final. Galway, the reigning champions, provided the opposition on that occasion and Flaherty had a brilliant game. After fourteen minutes he passed the sliothar to Pat Carroll who scored the first of Offaly's goals. The game hung in the balance right up until the very end when Flaherty hand-passed the sliothar into the net to secure a 2-12 to 0-15 win for Offaly. The handpassed goal was later ruled out of the game as hurling's technical standards improved. It was Flaherty's first All-Ireland title and he was later rewarded with an All-Star award. Offaly lost their provincial title to Kilkenny in 1983 and Flaherty retired from inter-county hurling shortly afterwards.

The municipal authority is an alternate vehicle for accomplishing public purposes without the direct action of counties, municipalities and school districts. These purposes commonly include the acquisition, financing, construction and operation of projects such as water supply and sewer systems, airports, transit systems, parking garages, flood control systems, parks, and similar entities. An authority may fix and collect rentals or other charges and may issue revenue bonds. A board appointed by the establishing government or governments governs each authority. A municipal authority may be said to be an independent corporate agent of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, exercising governmental, as well as private corporate power, in assisting the Commonwealth in meeting the needs of its citizens. Most, but not all, municipal authorities operate under Pennsylvania's Municipality Authorities Act. Reasons for establishing municipal authorities Common reasons for establishing municipal authorities include financing a project without tapping the general taxing or borrowing power of a municipality, facilitating the cooperative involvement of several municipalities in a project, and distancing the operation of a project from the political considerations inherent in direct municipal operation. All these reasons were involved, for example, when the Northland Public Library Authority was established to enable several municipalities to jointly own and operate a public library. The authority acquired the land for a new library, borrowed the construction money, built the building, and now operates the library. Absent the municipal authority, matters of joint ownership, joint financing, and joint operational control could be so thorny as to prevent the library's development in the first place, let alone allowing it to operate in an effective and businesslike manner. Census of municipal authorities In its 2002 Census of Governments, the U.S. Census Bureau listed 1,885 municipal authorities in Pennsylvania. Prominent among them are the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which operates Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport, large sewer authorities in Allegheny and Delaware counties, and parking authorities in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. There are also important parking authorities in Allentown, Bethlehem, Erie, Harrisburg, Lancaster, Reading and Scranton. Some authorities, such as the public transportation authorities in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, operate under special legislation rather than the Municipality Authorities Act.

She was requisitioned from Norway at the beginning of World War I, but was not completed until 1918 although she had been launched over three years earlier. On 16 September 1918, before she had even gone into action, she suffered a large fire in one of her 6-inch magazines, and had to be scuttled to prevent an explosion of her main magazines that would have devastated Dover. Her wreck was partially salvaged in 1926, and moved into a position in the northeastern end of the harbour where it would not obstruct traffic. It was subsequently buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal. Background Bjørgvin was ordered by Norway in 1913 to supplement the older and classes of coastal defence ships. She would have been known in Norway as P/S Bjørgvin; P/S stands for Panserskip (\\"armoured ship\\"), while Bjørgvin was the old name for the Norwegian city of Bergen. However, when World War I broke out, the Royal Navy requisitioned most warships under construction in Britain for foreign powers and refunded the two-thirds of Bjørgvins £370,000 purchase price already paid by the Norwegians.Buxton, p. 107 Construction and description Bjørgvin was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick on 26 May 1913 and launched on 8 August 1914. She was renamed Glatton after an earlier breastwork monitor of 1871. Her completion was greatly delayed by the modifications made by the British, which included modifying the boilers to use both oil and coal and conversion of 12 double-bottom tanks to carry the oil. This work began on 9 January 1915, but was suspended the following May, when it was estimated that only another 10–12 months of work remained, to allow for faster progress to be made on the large light cruisers and that were building in Armstrong's Naval Yard downriver. In September 1917, work was resumed to a new design that added a large anti-torpedo bulge along about 75% of the hull's length, suppression of the torpedo tubes and guns planned by the Norwegians, and a large tripod mast was to be fitted behind the single funnel to carry the directors for both the and guns. Both of these guns had to be relined to use standard British ammunition and the mount for the 9.2-inch gun was modified to give a maximum elevation of 40° which gave the gun a maximum range of . Addition of the bulges cost in speed, but prevented the extra weight resulting from all of these changes from deepening her draft. She was finally completed on 8 September 1918.Buxton, pp. 107, 113 Glatton in drydock. Note the width of the torpedo bulge Glatton displaced at deep load as built, with a length of , a beam of at maximum, although her main hull only had a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by two vertical triple expansion steam engines, which developed a total of from four Yarrow watertube boilers and gave a maximum speed of .Buxton, p. 113 She was armed with two 9.2-inch guns arranged in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Her secondary armament consisted of four six-inch guns, also in single-gun turrets, two of which superfired over the 9.2-inch turrets. The other two were positioned on each side of the superstructure. One anti-aircraft gun was mounted on each center-line 6-inch turret. She also carried four 3-pounder and two 2-pounder guns on high-angle mounts. Fate After completion, Glatton sailed for Dover on 11 September 1918 to prepare for the offensive planned for later that month. At 6:15 on the evening of 16 September, Glattons midships 6-inch magazine had a low-order explosion that ignited the cordite stored there. Flames shot through the roof of 'Q' turret, starboard midside, and started to spread aft. The ship's captain, Commander N. W. Diggle had been walking along the cliffs with Vice- Admiral Keyes when they heard the explosion and both men quickly returned to the harbour.Crossley, c. 2, para. 7 Diggle boarded the burning vessel and found that the only surviving officer on board was a junior surgeon. The captain took control of the situation and ordered the opening of the seacocks in the magazines to prevent further explosions. The forward magazines were flooded successfully, but the crew were unable to flood the rear magazines as the flames blocked access to the magazine flooding controls. The presence of the ammunition ship Gransha only away risked a massive explosion that would devastate Dover if Glattons rear magazine exploded and set off Granshas ammunition. Keyes boarded the recently arrived destroyer once apprised of the danger. He ordered Cossack to torpedo Glatton in an attempt to flood the magazine before it detonated. Cossacks first torpedo struck the anti-torpedo bulge amidships, but failed to explode because it had been fired too close to Glatton. Her second torpedo blew a hole in Glatton at 7:40, but the torpedo's warhead was too small to penetrate through her bulge and Glatton remained afloat, still burning. Keyes transferred to the destroyer and ordered her to fire on Glatton with her torpedoes at 8:15. They were aimed at the hole blown in Glattons starboard side by Cossacks second torpedo and succeeded in causing Glatton to capsize until her masts and superstructure rested on the harbour bottom and dousing the fire.Buxton, p. 110 Casualties were heavy: 60 men were killed outright and 124 were injured of whom 19 later died of their burns. =Inquiry= A Court of Enquiry held immediately afterwards found that the explosion had occurred in the midships 6-inch magazine situated between the boiler and engine rooms. The cause was more difficult to establish, but the Court did note that the stokers were in the habit of piling the red-hot clinker and ashes from the boilers against the bulkhead directly adjoining the magazine to cool down before they were sent up the ash ejector. The magazine was well insulated with of cork, covered by wood planking thick and provided with special cooling equipment so it was not likely that the cordite had spontaneously combusted. The magazine of Glattons sister ship Gorgon was emptied and examined. The red lead paint on the bulkhead was blistered beneath the lagging and tests at the National Physical Laboratory demonstrated that it had been subject to temperatures of at least . Recorded temperatures inside the magazine did not exceed and a test of red-hot ashes was inconclusive as the temperature in the lagging only reached with occasional hot spots of . Other tests did reveal that the cork could give off flammable fumes under high heat and pressurized air. While not entirely satisfied with this conclusion it found in April 1919 that \\"The slow combustion of the cork lagging of the 6-inch midship magazine of the Glatton led to the ignition of the magazine and then to the ignition of the cordite in it and so caused the explosion.\\"Buxton, pp. 111–12 As a precaution, Gorgons lagging was stripped out and replaced with silicate wool, revealing the real cause. Part of the cork was missing and folded newspapers were found in the empty space which were left there by the dockyard workers during construction. Furthermore, a number of rivets were entirely missing which meant that holes were present, which could have allowed the hot ashes to ignite the newspapers. The forced-draught pressure in the boiler room would have supplied air through the rivet holes, causing the cork to give off flammable gases, and eventually ignite the cordite charges.Buxton, p. 112 =Aftermath= Glatton remained in Dover Harbour, an obstruction to shipping, with her hull visible at low tide as the Harbour Board could not afford the £45,000 quoted on average by salvage companies. Finally they asked the Harbourmaster, Captain John Iron, if he could do it for less. He estimated it would cost about £5,000 if he was granted use of the salvage craft already at Dover. The Board accepted his offer and work began in May 1925. Some of silt were removed from underneath Glatton and her mainmast and superstructure were blasted away from the wreck. Four lifting lighters, with a capacity of , were hired, but they would not suffice to lift a water-logged ship. It was necessary to seal all of the holes on her topside and pump air into each compartment at a rate of per minute to restore her buoyancy. The first attempt to lift her began on 2 December 1925 and was successful in breaking the suction holding her to the bottom in combination with the rising tide. That was enough for the first try and the major lifting effort began the following day. Slowly she was moved, taking advantage of the tides, until on 16 March 1926 she was moved to a deep gully next to the western pier of the submarine harbour, close by the shore. The total cost was considerably more than originally estimated, but still far less than that quoted by the salvage companies, at no more than £12,000. There she remains, buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal.Buxton, pp. 112–13 Memorial A memorial was erected at St Mary's Church and Grange Road cemetery in Gillingham, Kent. The cemetery was used from 1867 until 1973 when the site was largely cleared of memorials to provide a community open space for the local population. Then Woodlands Road Cemetery was used and this is the current site of HMS Glatton's Memorial, with the graves of one officer and 56 men. See also *Edward L.

It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings) in the region by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 16 April 1654. In spite of being bereft of place of worship many of the local inhabitants remained to be Lutherans. A Lutheran church was built in 1866. A wooden Catholic Saint Martin church built in 16th century accidentally burnt down in 1993; a modern church was built in its place in 1996. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1466 in 1880 to 1642 in 1910 with the majority being native German-speakers (at least 909 or 62% in 1880, at most 1092 or 66.5% in 1910) accompanied by a Polish-speaking minority (at most 555 or 37.9% in 1880, at least 550 or 33.5% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Protestants (68.6%), followed by Roman Catholics (30%) and Jews (23 or 1.4%). It was then considered to be a part of a German language island around Bielsko (German: Bielitz-Bialaer Sprachinsel). After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

History  Archeological trails of a settlement encompassing a few hectares from La Tène period (400 BCE to the 1st century BCE) have been found on a hill in the village, where iron has been smelted. The village was first mentioned in 1447 as Bucze Łazy (?). However it could have existed already in the 13th century,J.

Max von Gagern (b. Weilburg (in Nassau), Germany, 25 March 1810; died Vienna, 17 October 1889) was a German liberal politician. Early life He was the son of Hans Christoph von Gagern, minister of state in Nassau; he attended the gymnasiums at Kreuznach, Mannheim, and Weilburg, and studied law from 1826 at Heidelberg, Utrecht, and Göttingen. After a stay in Paris he received in 1829 a position in the cabinet of William I, King of the Netherlands. At the outbreak of the Belgian Revolution (1830) he joined the Dutch army as a volunteer and took part in the war against Belgium. In 1833 he retired from the service of the Netherlands, married Franzina Lambert, of The Hague, and took up historical studies in order to fit himself for the position of Privatdozent at Bonn University. He was at Bonn during the years 1837-40. In 1837, although still a Protestant, he sided with the imprisoned Archbishop of Cologne, Droste-Vischering, and thus lost the favour of the Prussian Government. In 1840 he was appointed ministerial successor with the title of Legationsrat by the Duke of Nassau. On 28 August 1843, he joined the Roman Catholic Church. Although naturally very religious he had grown indifferent to religion during his student life and his residence in the Netherlands. Acquaintance with Catholics and with the historian George Frederick Böhmer, who was friendly to Catholicism, awakened in him respect and veneration for the Church. The chief sources of his Catholic knowledge were, as he himself says, the Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis, the study of Johann Möhler's Symbolik, and the New Testament. His conversion did not affect the favour of the Duke of Nassau who appointed him in 1844 extraordinary envoy to the Courts of the Netherlands and Belgium. 1848 Revolution Gagern's labours during the revolutionary year of 1848 extended far beyond his native state. He was the centre of the efforts that aimed to mediate between the Government and the people and to reorganize the German Confederation as a nation. According to the schemes Prussia was to have the supreme direction of German affairs. With this end in view Gagern negotiated with the Governments of Southern Germany and with Prussia. He then took part in the debates of the preliminary parliament in Frankfurt, and at the same time was one of the seventeen confidential agents of the governments who were to aid the parliament of the Confederation in revising the constitution. He was chosen president of this committee of seventeen, but was not as prominent at the Frankfurt Parliament as his brother Heinrich whom he supported. He joined the Catholic Club. On 5 August 1848, he was made under-secretary for foreign affairs in the imperial ministry which Archduke Johann, as administrator of the empire, had temporarily formed. In the question as to the constitution of Germany he worked with his brother for \\"little Germany\\" (exclusion of Austria from Germany, union of Germany under a Prussian empire). When the King of Prussia declined the imperial crown offered to him and the Parliament of Frankfurt approached dissolution, Von Gagern and his party withdrew from the assembly. Later life In 1850 Gagern was again in the service of the State of Nassau, being employed as an upper ministerial clerk. He had, however, lost the confidence of the duke by his \\"Little Germany\\" policy, and influential circles looked upon the Catholic Church unfavourably. In 1854, after having been conspicuously slighted, he retired from the state service. His efforts to obtain a historical professorship at Bonn failed, allegedly owing to the dislike of Protestants for converts to Catholicism. During the years 1855-73 he was in the service of Austria, first as head clerk in a ministerial department, then as departmental head in the mercantile political division of the ministry of foreign affairs. From 1860 he had also charge of the department of the press for foreign affairs, a position which gave him a deep insight into Austrian policy without, however, leading to an independent position. In 1881, eight years after his retirement on a pension, Emperor Franz Joseph I made him a life member of the upper house of the imperial Austrian Parliament.

The film stars David Keith, Mel Harris, Leighton Meester, and Douglas Smith, with a cameo by novelist and Northwest native Peretti. The filming took place in Spokane, Washington, with interior and exterior shots of John R. Rogers High School. Additional exterior shots were filmed at nearby Riverside State Park, as well as Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  Plot summary  The film is set at John R. Rogers High School in Spokane, Washington. Ten years prior, student Abel Frye (Jake Richardson), a victim of bullying, had committed suicide by hanging himself on the school property. Fast-forward to the current day, when several student football players (who are also school bullies) are mysteriously becoming gravely ill. Just before falling into a coma, each victim is heard screaming the spirit's name, Abel Frye. In an effort to get to the bottom of the haunting, the school turns for help to the Veritas Project, a team of highly trained investigators who work undercover to unravel the truth about paranormal activities. The Veritas Project consists of the members of the Springfield family, including father Nate (David Keith), mother Sarah (Mel Harris), daughter Elisha (Leighton Meester), and son Elijah (Douglas Smith). The high-school students in the film represent various social classes or youth subcultures, including jocks, geeks, and goths. Prominent among the students in the film are members of the goth culture, who worship the ghost of Abel Frye. The goth students are led by Ian Snyder (Jake Richardson). Unbeknownst to the rest of the school, Norman Bloom, a young geek Elisha befriended, is Frye's nephew. In retaliation for the bullying and mistreatment inflicted on the different students, Bloom exacts revenge on the popular football players. Bloom's plan includes gaining access to the locker of each targeted bully and placing a deadly male spider, trapped in a straw, inside the locker. Bloom then gives the bully tainted money, upon which he has secretly placed trace amounts of female spider pheromones. When the unsuspecting bully reaches into his locker, the waiting male spider is easily attracted to the pheromones, and then crawls out and bites the student. Among the effects of the toxin, the affected students experience hallucinations, believing that the ghost of Abel Frye is after them. At one point, Bloom accidentally puts an additional female spider in one of the straws, which results in thousands of deadly spiders overtaking the school. Elisha Springfield, attending the school undercover as a student, eventually figures out the mystery and the diabolical plot designed by Norman Bloom. In fear of being discovered, Bloom attempts to keep his involvement in the haunting hidden by poisoning both himself and Elisha with a spider, hoping that they will both die. When Elijah figures out that Bloom is behind the sinister attacks in the school, he races to find his sister and the Springfield family rush to professor and scientist Dr. Algernon Wheeling (played by Peretti), who saves Elisha with an antivenom. In the end, the students at Rogers High School are protected not only from haunting and harm from others, but from the harm brought on by their own hatred and fear, as well.

It has a population of 5,242 (2016). It is located in the Silesian Foothills and in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The Polish name is of topographic origins and is derived from ash trees (Polish: jesion, locally jasień). German name is a composition of a personal name Heinz and dorf (German: a village).  History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as '. It meant that the village was supposed to pay a tithe from 11 greater lans. The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. The village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, probably mentioned already in an incomplete register of Peter's Pence payment from 1335 as Hankendorf and as such being one of the oldest in the region. It was (again?) mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Heyczendorff. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings) in the region by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 16 April 1654. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1673 in 1880 to 2365 in 1910 with a dwindling majority being native Polish-speakers (from 96.9% in 1880 and 97% in 1890 to 76.3% in 1910) accompanied by a growing German-speaking minority (from 43 or 2.6% in 1880 to 539 or 22.8% in 1910) and a few Czech-speaking persons (at most 8 or 0.5% in 1880), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Protestants (51.3%), followed by Roman Catholics (47.1%) Jews (23 or 0.9%) and 16 adhering to yet another faith. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.  Landmarks  * Catholic Saint George Church. * Lutheran Resurrection of Christ Church.

Pablo Fajardo Mendoza (or Pablo Fajardo) is an Ecuadorian lawyer and activist. He is the lawyer that has been leading the litigation against Chevron Corporation related to the environmental disaster he alleged was caused by the oil operations of Texaco (acquired by Chevron Corporation in 2001) in the Lago Agrio oil field between 1964 and 1990. In this process, Fajardo represented the over 30,000 local inhabitants affected by the spill of crude oil and toxic waste. Chevron, which instead blames Petroecuador and has not paid the judgement, has had repeated success in arguing against it. The judgement has been validated by further Ecuadorian courts and the Supreme Court of Canada but it has been declared fraudulently obtained by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and an arbitration court in The Hague.  Biography  Fajardo was raised in the province of Esmeraldas, from where his parents migrated to the Sucumbios province when he was 14. He worked first in an African palm plantation and later on for an oil company, an experience which he says led him to witness social injustice and environmental degradation first hand. When working for these companies as a teenager, Fajardo mobilized colleagues and friends to protest against them, which caused him to be fired. These experiences led Fajardo to the decision to become a professional lawyer defending human rights. With the help of the Roman Catholic Church, he put himself through law school in the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja and graduated in 2004. He then began leading the legal battle of the 75 plaintiffs that started a class-action lawsuit against Texaco in 1993 on behalf of the 30,000 local inhabitants and indigenous communities. Fajardo tried to argue that the inhabitants were affected by the company’s operations in the Lago Agrio oil field. On February 14, 2011, the local court of Sucumbios ordered Chevron Corporation (formerly Texaco) to pay $18.1 billion to remediate the extensive pollution of waters, soils and ecosystems, in one of the largest environmental judgements ever made. The verdict was later confirmed by the Ecuador Supreme Court in 2013, though the amount was reduced to $9.5 billion. Despite having previously insisted to move the process from the New York Court to Ecuadorian tribunals and having accepted jurisdiction there, Chevron Corporation has refused to pay the judgement claiming that the decision was “illegitimate and inapplicable”. Courtrooms and arbitrations outside Ecuador subsequently made rulings on the case, generally finding in Chevron's favour. In 2015, a key witness for Chevron admitted that his testimony, about the Ecuadorian verdict being coerced, was itself coerced. On July 2016, the Amazon Defense Coalition (ADC), which backed the original lawsuit responsible for Fajardo's recognition, suspended its relationship with Fajardo, complaining that he was complicit in the Ecuadorian government's decision to pay $112 million to Chevron and not to the ADC. The payment to Chevron Corporation came as a result of an arbitration ordered by an international court. Fajardo rejected the accusation on the basis that the organization he represents is the Union of People Affected by Texaco (UDAPT), and not the ADC. The UDAPT is the sole organization representing the indigenous people and farmers who started the lawsuit against Chevron, as affirmed by the at-the-time president of the Amazon Defense Coalition, Luis Yanza, and among others. Due to his prominent role in the legal case against Chevron, Fajardo has been target of repeated threats and intimidations. For this reason, in 2005, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States issued precautionary measures for Fajardo and Luis Yanza in an effort to protect their lives. In 2019, Fajardo estimated that Chevron was spending up to $250 million in some years to fight the $9.5 billion fine. On September 7, 2018 an international tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague unanimously ruled that the judgement \\"should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States\\". This refers to collection efforts in countries such as Canada where Chevron has subsidiaries. Canadian courts had recently decided against piercing the corporate veil to intervene. To describe this situation, Fajardo said \\"the legal structure that these companies have been building through auxiliary enterprises and holding companies is simply a structure to evade their responsibility and, in this case, to evade justice.\\" He also criticized the Permanent Court of Arbitration for applying a 1993 investment treaty retroactively. Fajardo is a supporter of the Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations, proposed by an inter-governmental working group at the United Nations. He has criticized the government of Lenin Moreno for enabling what he sees as a renewed corporate capture of Ecuador.  Recognitions  Fajardo won a CNN \\"Hero's award\\" in 2007 and, along with his former associate Luis Yanza, a Goldman Environmental Prize in 2008. He is featured in the 2009 documentary film Crude.

It is the first novel featuring Phryne Fisher. Plot introduction After the Honourable Phryne Fisher solves a country- house jewel robbery in record time, she is asked by Colonel and Mrs. Harper to look into the matter of their daughter in Australia, who they fear may be being poisoned by her husband. Having grown bored with English social life, Phryne is happy to have an excuse to put off making decisions about her future for the next few months or so, and promptly relocates to Melbourne. Plot summary Cocaine Blues opens with a theft at the country house belonging to Phryne Fisher's family, during a dinner party described as the 'social event of the year'. A valuable diamond necklace belonging to a guest is stolen, and Phryne is able to identify the thief and recover the necklace based on her observations of the room, and of the guests during dinner. Following this, Phryne is asked by Colonel Harper and his wife to travel to Australia to determine if their son-in-law, John Andrews, is poisoning their daughter, Lydia. The Harpers give Phryne some letters from Lydia. Phryne notes that the letters contain complaints about John and financial and investment advice to Lydia's parents. She also notes a reference to a Turkish bath run by a Madame Breda. Phryne accepts the Harpers' request and travels to Melbourne, Australia, which is also the place of her birth. She is joined on the voyage by Dr. Elizabeth Macmillan, a surgeon on her way to take up a position at the Queen Victoria Hospital for women, and an old acquaintance of Phryne's from her time serving as the driver of an ambulance unit in France during World War I. In Melbourne, Phryne meets Cec and Bert, two cab drivers, at the docks, and engages them to drive her to the Windsor Hotel, where she stays for the duration of the novel. Soon after her arrival, Phryne meets Dorothy 'Dot' Williams and prevents her from committing an assault on her ex-employer's son, who had molested her and had her fired when she rebuffed his advances. Phryne engages Dot to work as her personal maid and social secretary instead. Once in Melbourne, Phryne visits members of local society, and secures an invitation to a dinner party where she meets Lydia Andrews. She also meets Bobby Matthews, the thief she had exposed back in England, a Russian countess who styles herself as Princesse de Grasse, and twin Russian ballet dancers, Sasha De Lisse and his sister Elli. It is later revealed to Phryne that De Lisses' mother was the Princess' daughter, and she died of cocaine addiction in Paris. The three have since dedicated themselves to finding and exposing cocaine traders. Phryne establishes a friendship with Lydia Andrews, despite disliking her clinging and apathetic behaviour and secures an invitation to Lydia's house for lunch. She dances a tango with Sasha De Lisse and later rescues him from thugs after he attempts to independently track down the distributor of cocaine in Melbourne, a person known as the 'King of Snow'. Phryne tentatively agrees to collaborate with the Russians, despite some misgivings about their honesty and intentions. Along with the Princesse de Grasse, Phryne visits the Turkish Baths run by Madame Breda. The Princess tells Phryne that the baths are a distribution center for cocaine and they purchase a small parcel of cocaine. Phryne dispatches this parcel to Dr. Macmillan to be analysed, but finds that a similar parcel has been planted in a room at the hotel. She dispatches the second parcel as well and replaces it with a decoy parcel of sodium bicarbonate. Later, when her hotel room is raided by Inspector Jack Robinson following an anonymous tip, she and the Inspector discover that a police constable Ellis had been blackmailed into planting another parcel of cocaine in her room. Dr. Macmillan confirms that one parcel contained cocaine, but that the other contained ordinary table salt. Following her lunch with Lydia Andrews, Phryne suspects she may have been poisoned but administers an emetic to herself and recovers in her hotel room. She later convinces Lydia's maid to secure nail and hair clippings from Lydia and has them analysed by Dr. Macmillan to show slow arsenic poisoning. On conversation with Bobby Matthews, and on the basis of overheard conversations with Lydia Andrews and her friends, she discovers that Lydia has a keen head for business while her husband does not. Phryne then dresses up as a prostitute and, accompanied by Bert, visits a local bar where she has heard cocaine is being distributed. They locate the distributors after Sasha, unaware of Phryne's presence, gets into an altercation with them. Phryne follows the distributor and Sasha to the Turkish Baths, where they catch and confine both, Sasha and Phryne. Here Phryne's suspicions are confirmed when it is revealed that Lydia Andrews is the King of Snow and has been administering mild and non-fatal doses of arsenic to herself to redirect suspicion away from herself after her proposed poisoning of her husband. Lydia attempts to convince Phryne that she should join Lydia in the business, but Phryne and Sasha pretend to engage in sexual activities to take advantage of Lydia's distaste for any kind of sexual contact to distract her and disarm her. Meanwhile, Dot, Dr. Macmillan and a local MP are sent an indirect message by Phryne and they alert the police, allowing Inspector Robinson to arrest Lydia as well as the distributors. The book ends with a dinner party hosted by Phryne. A sub-plot concerns the breaking of an illegal abortion racket. Early in the novel Bert and Cec are engaged by a mysterious man to drive a girl to her home, but on taking her in their cab, they discover she is injured and bleeding. Bert and Cec take the injured girl to Dr. Macmillan at her hospital, where it is revealed that her name is Alice Greenham and that she has suffered a botched abortion. Dr. Macmillan reports this incident to Inspector Jack Robinson at the Melbourne police station, who informs her that a disbarred doctor known as 'Butcher George' has been performing illegal abortions that frequently result in the deaths of his patients, however, without any surviving patient being unwilling to provide evidence, the police have been unable to catch him. Phryne, on hearing this from Dr. Macmillan, manages to track down Butcher George through one of Dot's friends, and helps set up a police operation that involves sending Woman-Police Officer Jones in as a decoy to entrap Butcher George. The operation is successful and Butcher George is caught. Cec, who has been taking care of Alice Greenham, proposes marriage to her at the end of the story, but Alice asks him to ask her again in six months so that she has a chance to put her life in order again.

Adaptations Cocaine Blues, as well as other novels featuring Phryne Fisher, were adapted into the Australian television series Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. The television adaptation of this book was in Episode 1 of Season 1 of Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, and bore several differences from the original novel. In the television episode, an additional subplot is created concerning Miss Fisher's sister, Jane. In the novel, Phryne Fisher's sister is said to have died of diphtheria and starvation, however, in the television series, Phryne has frequent flashbacks to her youth and her sister, and a reference is made suggesting that Jane might have been murdered. It is additionally suggested that Phryne Fisher's interest in detective work may have been motivated by this.

History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Grodische villa Snessonis. However it was written in an atypical form and suggests that a village was older. There should be another village named similarly, and even older from Snesson's village. Because Grodische villa Snessonis was listed among villages located between Skoczów and Czechowice it is undoubtly linked to nowadays Grodziec, whereas the other Grodische, not mentioned in Liber fundationis... is associated with Grodziszcz, in Czech Hradiště, now part of Těrlicko in the Czech Republic.I. Panic, 2010, s. 291 The name of the villages suggests that there existed a fortificated wooden gord.J. Polak, 2011, s. 6 It was later rebuilt to a manor house, and to a château in 1542-1580. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Grodecz. After 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings) in the region by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 18 April 1654. It is now served by Saint Bartholomew Church. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skoczów. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 619 in 1880 to 569 in 1910, with majority of the inhabitants being native Polish-speakers (94%-97.6%) and minority German- (most 5.5% in 1900) and Czech-speaking (most 1.1% in 1890), and mostly Roman Catholics (91.5% in 1910), followed by Protestants (8.3% in 1910). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as Item in Rudgeri villa primo silva inciditur.. It meant that forest was being cut down to make a place for a creation of this new village. It was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. The village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, first mentioned in an incomplete register of Peter's Pence payment from 1335 as villa Rudgeri and as such being one of the oldest in the region. It was again mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deaconry as 'Rudgersdorff. The name, Rudgersdorf indicates Germanic origins of the settlers. They were later polonized and in 1452 it appears under somewhat Polish name Rauditz, which was not however a plain translation of its German name. Rauditz which evolved to Rudzica is of topographic origin and hints of ruddish water in the local river.J. Polak, 2011, s. 6 Later the distinction of two parts of the village developed: Rudzica Mała (lit. Small Rudzica, first mentioned in 1600 as na Maley Rudiczy) and Rudzica Wielka (mentioned in 1603 as na Welkj Rudicy). Later on the German name evolved and consolidated as Riegersdorf (Groß und Klein Riegersdorf, 1754; Riegersdorf Groß und Klein, pohlnisch: Rudzica, 1804). After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 16 April 1654. Throughout history Rudzica belonged to several noble families. In 1802 it was purchased into Teschener Kammer and belonged to it up to World War I.

The Baiturrahman Grand Mosque is a symbol of religion, culture, spirit, strength, struggle and nationalism of the Acehnese people. The mosque is a landmark of Banda Aceh and has survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.  History  The original multi-tiered Great Mosque of the Sultanate of Aceh is the most prominent building in this 18th-century view of Banda Aceh. The original Masjid Raya (\\"Grand Mosque\\") was built in 1612 during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda. Some say the original mosque was built even earlier in 1292 by Sultan Alaidin Mahmudsyah. The original royal mosque featured a multi-tiered thatched roof, a typical feature of Acehnese architecture. When the Colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies attacked the Kraton During the First Aceh Expedition on 10 April 1873, the Acehnese attacked the KNIL from the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque. From some flares shot onto the thatched roof, the mosque caught fire. General van Swieten promised the local rulers he would rebuild the mosque and create a warm place for mercy. In 1879 the Dutch rebuilt the Mosque Baiturrahman as a gift to — and to reduce the anger of — the Acehnese. Construction only began in 1879, when the first stone was laid by Tengku Qadhi Malikul Adil, who became its first imam, and was completed on 27 December 1881 during the reign of Muhammad Daud Syah, the last sultan of Aceh. Many Acehnese initially refused to pray at Baiturrahman because it was built by the Dutch, whom they were warring against. Nowadays, however, it is a source of pride for Banda Aceh.http://www.travelmarker.nl/bestemmingen/azie/indonesie/bezienswaardigheden/banda_aceh.htm Before 1935, the new Baiturrahman Grand Mosque featured one dome and one minaret. At first, the mosque featured only one dome and one minaret. More domes and minarets were added in 1935, 1958 and 1982. Today the mosque has seven domes and eight minarets, including the highest in Banda Aceh.http://lestariheritage.net/aceh/webpages/sites01.html Aceh Heritage The mosque survived the 2004 earthquake and tsunami with minor damages such as wall cracks. The earthquake had slightly tilted and cracked the 35-meter minaret by the main gate. During the disaster, the mosque served as a temporary shelter for displaced persons and only reopened for prayers after two weeks.  Architecture and design  Facade of Baiturrahman Grand Mosque. The mosque was originally designed by the Dutch architect Gerrit Bruins.http://atjehpost.co/articles/read/4881/Amazing-Baiturrahman-Kisah-Awal- Mula-Masjid-Raya-Banda-Aceh Amazing Baiturrahman; Kisah Awal Mula Masjid Raya Banda Aceh The design was subsequently adapted by L.P. Luijks, who also supervised the construction work done by contractor Lie A Sie. The design chosen is Mughal revival style, characterized by grand domes and minarets. The unique black domes are constructed from hard wood shingles combined as tiles. The interior is decorated with relieved wall and pillars, marble staircase and floor from China, stained-glass windows from Belgium, well-decorated wooden doors, and ornate bronze chandeliers. The building stones are from the Netherlands. At the time of its completion, this new design presented a stark contrast compared with the original mosque that many Acehnese refused to pray in the mosque, because it was built by the Dutch \\"infidels\\". Today however, the mosque has become the pride of Banda Aceh. Today, the mosque has 7 domes, 8 minarets, and 32 pillars.

His most important contribution was recognizing that the hydrophobic effect plays a key role in determining the three-dimensional structure of proteins.Walter Kauzmann, Some Factors in the Interpretation of Protein Denaturation, Advances in Protein Chemistry (1959) Vol. 14, pgs 1–63. He is also well known for an insight into the nature of supercooled liquids which is now known as Kauzmann's paradox.[Walter Kauzmann, The Nature of the Glassy State and the Behavior of Liquids at Low Temperatures, Chemical Reviews (1948), Vol 43, pg. 219.] At Princeton, Kauzmann was the David B. Jones Professor Emeritus of Chemistry. He chaired the Department of Chemistry from 1964 to 1968 and the Department of Biochemical Sciences from 1980 to 1981. He was born in Mount Vernon, New York and grew up in New Rochelle, New York. He was the son of the German-born Albert F. Kauzmann, who came to the United States in 1895, and Julia (Kahle) Kauzmann. Albert operated a gem-importing business in Lower Manhattan and would often bring his son to work on Saturday mornings. They would spend the afternoon at the American Museum of Natural History or attend a matinee at the Metropolitan Opera, nurturing Walter's lifelong love of science and music. Kauzmann earned a B.A. degree in 1937 from Cornell University, which he attended on a full scholarship. He started his doctoral work at Princeton University in organic chemistry, but switched to physical chemistry, earning a Ph.D. in 1940 under the direction of Henry Eyring. Following his Ph.D., Kauzmann had a two-year postdoctoral appointment in Pittsburgh as a Westinghouse Research Fellow, in the laboratory led by Edward U. Condon. It was during this period that Kauzmann wrote his now classic paper on supercooled liquids and glasses that contained the Kauzmann paradox. At the end of this fellowship, with the U.S. fighting WWII, Kauzmann joined the U.S. government's National Defense Research Council laboratory in Bruceton, Pennsylvania, which was directed by George Kistiakowsky, and worked on chemical explosives. In 1944, Kauzmann was recruited into the top secret Manhattan Project and he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Eventually, Kauzmann was put in charge of producing the detonator for the Trinity test, which was the first detonation of an atomic bomb, and of the (Fat Man) plutonium bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan. Kauzmann witnessed the Trinity test on July 16, 1945, and his memories were recorded in a newspaper article.Jon Blackwell, 1944: Brain power into nuclear power, The Trentonian Fifty years later, Kauzmann discussed why he worked on the atomic bomb: \\"But there was another, even stronger reason that many of us felt justified our working as hard as we could on the bomb. It was felt that if it were possible to make atomic bombs, somewhere, someday, someone would figure out how to do it and some country would proceed to make them. If this were done after World War II was over, the bomb would very likely be made as a secret weapon. This would inevitably lead to World War III. Therefore, there were strong reasons for trying to make the bomb - and use it - before the end of World War II. The people of the world would then know the terrible thing that could be unleashed if there were a World War III. And the politicians could then be encouraged to try to do something about preventing World War III.\\" Walter Kauzmann’s Reminiscences from a life in protein physical chemistry, Protein Science (1993) Vol 2, pgs 671-691. In 1946, Kauzmann returned to Princeton as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and remained on the Princeton Faculty throughout his long academic career. His work was centered in the area of biophysical chemistry, particularly the studies of the structure and thermodynamics of proteins. His insight that hydrophobic interactions play a key role in stabilizing protein structure was made before X-ray crystallography provided the first three-dimensional structures of proteins. Kauzmann's model, that proteins fold to bury hydrophobic residues and to expose hydrophilic ones, has stood the test of time Tanford, C. & Reynolds, J. Nature's Robots: A History of Proteins Ch. 12 (Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, 2001 and is one of the key principles of de novo protein structure prediction. Kauzmann became an emeritus professor in 1982. His first book, Quantum Chemistry, was published in 1957, followed by The Kinetic Theory of Gases (1966) and Thermodynamics and Statistics (1967). With David Eisenberg, a former postdoctoral fellow of Kauzmann, he wrote The Structure and Properties of Water (1969), a book reissued in 2005 by Oxford University Press as part of its Classic Texts in the Physical Sciences series. The first three are textbooks for undergraduate physical chemistry, which Kauzmann taught at Princeton for many years. Kauzmann's pedagogy is discussed in an article by Bruce Alberts.Bruce Alberts, Walter Kauzmann’s contribution to the future of science: a personal recollection, Biophysical Chemistry (2003) Vol. 105, pgs. 175-177. Kauzmann married Elizabeth Flagler Kauzmann, then a research assistant in the laboratory of Frank Johnson in the Princeton Biology Department, in April, 1951. Elizabeth died in 2004 after more than 50 years of marriage. They are survived by two sons, a daughter, and eight grandchildren. They summered on Cape Breton Island, and eventually donated of their property to the Nova Scotia Nature Trust.Nova Scotia Nature Trust Awards and honors * Guggenheim Fellowships (1957 and 1994) * Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1963) * Elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences (1964) * Inaugural Linderstrøm-Lang Prize for outstanding contributions in the areas of biochemistry or physiology (1966). * Honorary Ph.D. from The University of Stockholm (1992) * Stein and Moore Award of the Protein Society “for his seminal work on the physical chemistry of proteins.” (1993) * A special issue of Elsevier's 'Biophysical Chemistry' was published in September 2003, Volume 105, Issues 2-3, Pages 153-772, to celebrate Walter Kauzmann's 85th Birthday. * Princeton University established an annual Walter Kauzmann Lectureship in Chemistry.

Unlike the Forest of High Peak and Duffield Frith it was not taken over by William I, but became a royal forest in the reign of Henry II. Stretching as it did over practically the whole length of the present-day county it was much larger than the other two. Bordering on Sherwood Forest, it made a continuous area stretching from the River Derwent to the Trent. The custodians were the Cauz family of Laxton in Nottinghamshire, who had inherited it from Geoffrey Alselin who was related by marriage to Gerard de Normanville, who it is believed had been made custodian of Sherwood Forest by William I. Matilda de Cauz had married Ralph fitzStephen, chamberlain to Henry II. On his death in 1202, King John seized the manor of Laxton and her custodianship of the forest, which were restored to her in 1217 after his death. Custodianship of Sherwood Forest passed to John de Birkin, then to his son, and finally by marriage to Robert de Everingham. However in 1225 East Derbyshire was disafforested. It may be about this time that William de Ferrers II extended Duffield Frith to the east of the River Derwent to build a new hunting lodge at Belper.

On the Plague In his treatise about the plague (Muqni'at al-Sā'il 'an al-Maraḍ al-Hā'il), (ca.753/1362), Ibn al-Khatib explores the idea of transmission of disease through contagion, centuries before Louis Pasteur conducted his experiments in Europe.

In his treatise On the Plague, Ibn al-Khatib writes: > \\"The existence of contagion is established by experience [and] by > trustworthy reports on transmission by garments, vessels, ear-rings; by the > spread of it by persons from one house, by infection of a healthy sea-port > by an arrival from an infected land [and] by the immunity of isolated > individuals.\\" While the plague hadith indicated that the Prophet suggested otherwise, > \\"a proof taken from the traditions has to undergo modification when in > manifest contradiction with the evidence of the perception of the > senses.\\"Arnold, Thomas W. and A.

Ober, William B., and Nabil Alloush, \\"Plague at Granada, 1348-1349: Ibn al-Khatib and Ideas of Contagion.\\", pp.175 As a loyal courtier of Muhammed V of Granada, Ibn al-Khatib was arrested in the wake of a 1359 coup by Muhammed's half-brother Ismail, and had his property confiscated. He was soon released due to interference by the Marinid sultan of Morocco and joined a host of Andalusian refugees in Morocco, where he settled in the Atlantic town of Salé. Here, he immersed himself in Sufi mysticism and writing. It was during this stay in Morocco that he first met Ibn Khaldun, as well as other important North African intellectuals, such as Ibn Marzuq. In 1362, the former emir of Granada, Muhammed V, was able to regain the throne with help from the Moroccan sultan. This allowed Ibn al-Khatib to return to Granada and resume the office of Great Vizier (dhu al-wizaratayn, ie. 'possessor of the two vizierates', meaning 'head of both the civil and military authority'). He soon ran afoul of severe political intrigue. He was eventually able to strengthen his own position while organizing the expulsion of a number of his North African political rivals from Granada. His political successes caused friction within Granada between supporters of the expelled North Africans and the politically savvy Ibn al-Khatib. When Ibn Khaldun had some diplomatic success at Granada's court, Ibn al-Khatib, fearing him as a rival, organized his expulsion. His intrigues had made him an unpopular figure in some circles, causing two of his own students, Ibn Zamrak and Ibn Farkun, to join hands with his most powerful enemy in Granada, the Grand Qadi al- Nubahi, a man who had long held a grudge against Ibn al-Khatib. More importantly, emir Muhammed V had grown distrustful of Ibn al-Khatib for his overbearing control of the Granadan state and his strict loyalty to the Marinids of Morocco. Feeling the heat rise, in 1371 Ibn al-Khatib left for North Africa, where he was well received by the Marinid sultan Abu Faris Abdul Aziz I of Morocco. During his refuge, the Grand Qadi al-Nubahi issued a fatwa in which Ibn al-Khatib's work on Sufism and philosophy were branded heretical and his work ordered to be burned. The ad hominem nature of al-Nubahi's legal decision strongly suggest that he had a personal grudge against Ibn al-Khatib. Ibn al-Khatib wrote a refutation of the fatwa, in which he harshly attacked al-Nubahi. Numerous attempts by Granada to get Ibn al-Khatib either extradited or executed were fruitless, as the Moroccan sultan Abu Faris Abdul Aziz I refused to do so. Though the Moroccan sultan soon died, Ibn al-Khatib was ensured of protection from Ibn Ghazi, Morocco's main vizier. Ibn al-Khatib's future turned bleak when a Granada-supported coup removed Ibn Ghazi from office and brought a new sultan to power, Abu'l-Abbas Ahmad al-Mustansir. Indebted to Granada, the new sultan ordered Ibn al-Khatib arrested and a trial be held in the Moroccan capital city of Fes, in which a Granadan group of emissaries, including his former student Ibn Zamrak, was actively involved. Despite intimidation and torture, Ibn al-Khatib kept protesting his innocence throughout the trial and denied the accusations of heresy. The final vote was far from unanimous and a council of Islamic scholars were unable to reach a conclusive decision. He was sent back to his prison cell and strangled later that night. On the next morning his body was buried near Fes' Bab al-Mahruq city gate. Unsatisfied, his enemies ordered his body dug up and thrown in a bonfire.

Origins According to local legends, all were once humans who had a standing in society either for their position or special attributes. They could have been an important leader, a renowned healer, a warrior, a pious man or even a respectable , or . Upon their death, locals and their followers would sometimes offer prayers at their gravestones, in line with the concept of . With the arrival of Chinese immigrants who carried along with them the Confucian belief of Ancestral Worship and their respect for Nature, both practices converged and formed a new micro-culture as observed today. Datuks, referred to in Chinese as Na Tuk Kong, is considered a localised form in worship of the spirit of the land, along with Tu Di Gong (Earth Deities). Shrines At the Malaysia downtown or countryside, one can easily spotted some small, yellow-coloured painted shrines called . They can be found by the roadside or under a tree. These shrines are usually worshipped by the residents living around the neighbourhood. The shrines are normally of a fusion Chinese-Malay design, with Islamic elements such as the crescent moon decorations. Inside the shrine, a small, decorated statue or a piece of stone (wrapped in yellow cloth) is venerated, representing the . Offerings are brought and placed around the , or sometimes on a small altar in front of it. Types One belief is that there are a total of nine types of , and that each of them were once great warriors and expert in Malay local martial arts, the except for the last . They were also known to possess great magical powers. Worshippers usually pray to for protection, good health, and good luck, and sometimes seek divine help to overcome their problems.

For example, in the old quarters of Georgetown, the presence of The Seven Brothers or Tujuh Beradik' 'is common while in the royal town of Klang in Selangor, most of the spirits worshipped are believed to be members of the royal court (sultans, officers, warriors etc.), each with their own unique identity. Worship ritual Worshippers usually offer fresh flowers, (betelnuts), (local hand rolled cigarettes), sliced (areca nuts) and local fruits. An important part of the praying ritual is also to burn some (benzoin, made from a local gum tree, when burnt emit a smoky fragrant smell). If their prayers are answered, the worshippers usually return to the shrine and make offerings or hold a (feast). Another common practise is for individuals to renovate the shrines to create a better looking shrine for the . In most places where there is a heavy presence of spirits, it is common to see shrines becoming larger over time, especially if individuals consider the to be 'powerful'. The items usually consist of yellow saffron rice, lamb or chicken curries, vegetables, (bananas), young coconuts, rose syrup, (local cigars) and local fruits. Pork items are considered impure and are therefore forbidden in shrines; visitors are also asked to not show disrespect when inside or around a shrine. Literature * M.

In September 1944, the submarine U-307 and the supply ship Carl J. Busch transported the men of Unternehmen Haudegen to the island. The station was active from 9 September 1944 to 4 September 1945 but lost radio contact in May 1945. The soldiers were capable of asking for support only in August 1945 and on 4 September, were picked up by a Norwegian seal hunting vessel and surrendered to its captain. The group of men were the last German troops to surrender after the Second World War. Background =Svalbard Archipelago= Topographical map of Svalbard The Svalbard Archipelago is in the Arctic Ocean from the North Pole and a similar distance north of Norway. The islands are mountainous, the peaks permanently snow- covered, some glaciated; there are occasional river terraces at the bottom of steep valleys and some coastal plain. In winter the islands are covered in snow and the bays ice over. Spitsbergen Island has several large fiords along its west coast and Isfjorden is up to wide. The Gulf Stream warms the waters and the sea is ice-free during the summer. Settlements were established at Longyearbyen and Barentsberg in inlets along the south shore of Isfjorden, in Kings Bay, north up the coast and in Van Mijenfjorden to the south. The settlements attracted colonists of different nationalities and the treaty of 1920 neutralised the islands and recognised the mineral and fishing rights of the participating countries. Before 1939, the population consisted of about 3,000 people, mostly Norwegian and Russian, who worked in the mining industry. Drift mines were linked to the shore by overhead cable tracks or rails and coal dumped in winter was collected after the summer thaw. By 1939 production was about a year, roughly evenly divided between Norway and Russia. =Allied operations= Operation Gauntlet Gauntlet was an Allied Combined Operation from 25 August until 3 September 1941 during the Second World War. Canadian, British and Free Norwegian Forces landed on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard Archipelago, south of the North Pole. Coal mines on the islands were owned and operated by Norway at Longyearbyen and by the Soviet Union at Barentsburg; both governments agreed to their destruction and the evacuation of their nationals. Gauntlets objective was to deny the Germans the coal, mining and shipping infrastructure, equipment and stores on Spitsbergen and suppress the wireless stations on the archipelago, to prevent the Germans receiving weather reports. Gauntlet was a success, the Germans had not known of the expedition until it was long gone. The raiders suffered no casualties, the Svalbard population were repatriated, several ships were taken by the raiders as prizes; and a German warship was sunk on the return journey. Operation Fritham Operation Fritham (30 April – 14 May 1942) was an Allied attempt to secure the coal mines on Spitzbergen, the main island of the Svalbard Archipelago, from the North Pole and about the same distance from Norway. A party of Norwegian troops sailed from Scotland on 30 April, to reoccupy the island and eject a German meteorological party. On 14 May, four German reconnaissance bombers sank the ships in Green Harbour. The commander, Einar Sverdrup, and eleven men were killed, eleven men were wounded and most of the supplies were lost with the ships. On 26 May, a Catalina made contact with Fritham Force and destroyed a German Ju 88 bomber caught on the ground. More sorties delivered supplies, attacked German weather bases, evacuated wounded and rescued shipwrecked sailors. Operation Gearbox Operation Gearbox (30 June – 17 September 1942) was a Norwegian and British operation which superseded Operation Fritham. The survivors of Fritham Force had salvaged what equipment they could and set up camp in Barentsburg, which had been deserted since Operation Gauntlet and sent out reconnaissance parties. The Admiralty discovered much of what had happened, through Ultra decrypts of Luftwaffe Enigma coded wireless signals. On 2 July, 57 Norwegians with of supplies arrived by cruiser. Barentsburg was fortified and parties attacked the German weather party at Longyearbyen on 12 July, only to find that they had departed three days earlier. The airstrip was blocked and on 23 July, a Ju 88, carrying an experienced crew and two senior officials, was shot down while flying low over the landing ground; the German plan to send another weather party had been thwarted. Operation Gearbox II Operation Gearbox II (17 September 1942 – 7 September 1943) was a Norwegian and British operation. The reinforcements of Operation Gearbox consolidated the Barentsburg defences and made preparations for Gearbox II, another reinforcement of the Norwegians and part of the plan for Convoy PQ 18, to prevent a repeat of Convoy PQ 17 (27 June – 10 July 1942) in which 24 of the 35 freighters had been sunk. The fleet oilers and and four destroyer escorts sailed from Scapa Flow on 3 September and anchored in Lowe Sound several days later. From 9 to 13 September, relays of destroyers were detached from PQ 18 to refuel before the convoy passed Bear Island and into range of the Luftwaffe bombers and torpedo-bombers based in north Norway. Another German weather party was chased off the island by the Norwegians and on 19 October, the cruiser and four destroyers delivered more Norwegian troops. =German operations= Operation Bansö, 1941–1942 By August 1941, the Allies had eliminated German weather stations on Greenland, Jan Mayen Island, Bear Island (Bjørnøya) and the civil weather reports from Spitzbergen. The Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe surveyed land sites for weather stations in the range of sea and air supply, some to be manned and others automatic. Wettererkundungsstaffel 5 (Wekusta 5) part of Luftflotte 5, was based at Banak in northern Norway. Dr Erich Etienne, a former Polar explorer, commanded an operation to install a manned station at Advent Bay (Adventfjorden); its subsoil of alluvial gravel was acceptable for a landing ground. The site received the code-name Bansö (from Banak and Spitzbergen Öya) and ferry flights of men, equipment and supplies began on 25 September. He 111, Ju 88 and Ju 52 pilots gained experience of landing on soft ground, cut with ruts and boulders. The British followed events at Bletchley Park through Ultra decrypts, which was made easier by German willingness to make routine use of radio communication. Dr Albrecht Moll and three men arrived to spend the winter of 1941–1942 transmitting weather reports. On 29 October 1941, Hans Knoespel and five weathermen were installed by the Kriegsmarine at Lilliehöökfjorden, a branch of Krossfjord in the north-western Spitzbergen. On 2 May 1942, the apparatus for an automatic weather station, a thermometer, barometer, transmitter and batteries arrived at Banak, in a box named a Kröte (toad) by the aircrew. As soon as weather permitted, it was to be flown to Bansö and the Moll party brought back. On 12 May a He 111 and a Ju 88 were sent with supplies and the technicians to install the Kröte. The aircraft reached Adventfjorden at The He 111 crew and passengers joined the ground party Luftwaffe operations, June–July The Moll party at Bansö had reported the British flight of 26 May and on 12 June, signalled that the landing ground was dry enough for a landing attempt. A Ju 88 flew to the island and landed but damaged its propellers as it taxied, stranding the crew and increasing the German party to 18 men. Luftwaffe aircraft flew to Spitzbergen each day but were warned off each time and the Germans thought about using floatplanes. The east end of Isfjorden and Advent Bay were too full of drifting ice and the idea was dropped. In the midnight sun (20 April – 22 August) as mid-summer approached, the ice further west near the Allied positions cleared faster than at the German (eastern) end of the fiord. The Germans reported the Catalina attack on the Ju 88 on 27 June, which had left it a write-off and claimed to have damaged the British aircraft with return fire. On 30 June, the party sent a message that the airstrip was dry enough for Junkers Ju 52 aircraft and supply flights resumed. The aircraft were watched by a Norwegian party which had gone on an abortive expedition to destroy the German headquarters at the Hans Lund Hut. On clear days the German pilots flew direct over the mountains and on cloudy and misty days, when heavily laden, took the coast route past Barentsburg. German bases 1942–1943 Nussbaum, another Kriegsmarine meteorological party, commanded by Dr Franz Nusser, departed Norway in to return to Svalbard and re-occupy the Knospe base at Signehamna that had spent the winter of 1941–1942 gathering weather data. Two journeys to Svalbard were made and Nussbaum became operational in November 1942. During the winter of 1942–1943, Nussbaum needed no air supply but in May, spare parts were needed for its motor and hydrogen generators. The supplies were dropped by a Fw 200 of KG 40 which flew from Vaernes on 6, 8 and 18 May, collecting weather data en route. On 20 June 1943 Nussbaum was surprised by Norwegian commando patrol, commanded by Kaptein E. Ullring with Fenrik Augensen, surveying Kongs Fjord and Kross Fjord in a gunboat. Five of the six Germans escaped to the coast of the Mitra peninsula but Heinz Kohler, who was closer to the water was killed by the Norwegians near Signehamna. The weather party had managed to send a distress call before they fled and (Kapitănleutnant Herbert Sickel), cruising off Svalbard, embarked the party on 22 June. The Nussbaum party had seen a overhead but had not been spotted. On 26 June, U-302 rendezvoused with (Kapitănleutnant Hans Benker) to transfer the party, which arrived at Narvik on 28 June. Operation Haudegen In the Rijpfjord district of Nordaustlandet, the intended site of the Haudegen weather station was under low cloud but was seen to be ice-free. The Schalzgraber weather station could be seen to be the same state as when it was abandoned in July. A Fw 200 made a round trip, which took more than 12 hours; the Fw 200 landed at Banak at on 8 September. The flight was made pointless after the mission was diverted to Greenland. Haudegen took place from 10 September 1944 when the Germans sailed from Hammerfest in Norway on the submarine U-307 and the weather ship Carl J. Busch to 6 September 1945 when the party went aboard the Norwegian ship Blåsel, having surrendered to the crew.

The village sits at an elevation of 3596 feet above sea level in the area of Monti della Laga within the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park. History =Overview= The village likely takes its name from the word sèrrə which in the local dialect means crest. The location of Serra is in fact on a high elevation overlooking the Vezzola river. In previous times the village belonged to the Università (a medieval term typically referring to several small clusters of dwellings) of the village of Rocca Bisegna. Others areas sharing this distinction included Faiete-Cona Faiete, San Biagio, Pomarolo and Macchia Santa Cecilia. In a book published in 1804 by Luigi Ercole the village is listed as having 38 inhabitants. By 1841 this figure had swelled to 44. In 2007 Serra had but one sole remaining citizen. The village has an elongated shape and the only remaining houses face the one road that runs through its center. Although they have not yet come to fruition, plans are underway to restore several of the old historic dwellings and perhaps build a resort hotel nearby. =Historical notes= *In 1124 the Totoneschi family were granted rights to landholdings in the area by the local Catholic Church. *In 1270 documents refer to the involvement of Giacomo di Serris in the renting of this land area. *In 1279 a land transaction occurred regarding the local Church of San Salvatore. One individual involved in this transaction was Tommaso di Berardo of Serra Stephanesca. *In 1813 Serra is listed as belonging to the università of Rocca di Bisegno Traditions During the Feast of the Assumption many people gather at Serra for a religious celebration. The participants gather on foot and form a procession to the San Salvatore Church. During this activity the marchers gather all of the snails that they encounter along the way as these are believed to contain the souls of the deceased remaining in Purgatory. The snails are then blessed by the priest, thereby absolving the spirits of their previously-committed earthly sins. After the religious ceremonies a great feast is enjoyed by all. The Church of San Salvatore Just before entering the town the Church of San Salvatore can be found a somewhat higher elevation. The church was renovated in the first half of the 19th century. It sits upon the ruins of a previous structure which bore the same name. In the past, a religious festival took place each year on 9 November. In days past another holiday celebration would take place in the month of May. Project Borghi (Burgs) Serra today is one of three villages (the other two being Martese and Tavolero) chosen by the Province of Teramo as sites for future touristic development. As part of this large-scale project data related to the architectural, environment, and touristic aspects of more than 50 nearby villages and locals were systematically gathered and painstakingly analyzed before deciding upon the exact locations to be developed. These three villages were chosen for their authenticity, representativeness, and overall potential with regard to the criteria that had been established by the provincial authorities.

The family prospered as coal (in nearby Silverdale, Staffordshire) and iron owners and also brick and tile manufacturers. In about 1851 the old house was replaced with the current imposing mock Jacobean design by architect Anthony Salvin. The three storeyed castellated entrance front has four octagonal turrets and other fronts have curved gables. The 19th century stable block known as the 'Clock House' also has Grade II listed building status.

They had undertaken a morganatic marriage that meant they would spend the rest of their lives living in exile in England, France and Germany. During the ten years the Grand Duke lived at Keele Hall, he took up the life of an English country gentleman. The town council of Newcastle- under-Lyme even conferred on him the distinction of Lord High Steward of the borough. =1945-Present= The Hall was requisitioned by the army during World War II and in 1948 with the aid of grant funding the Keele estate was purchased from another Ralph Sneyd for the establishment of the University College of North Staffordshire, which in 1962 became Keele University.

Life Pol's tomb, Skałka Church Etching from a photograph, by Adolf Piwarski (1862) Pol was born in Lublin (then in Galicia), to Franz Pohl (or Poll), a German in the Austrian service, and his wife Eleonora Longchamps de Berier, from a French family living in Poland. Pol fought in the Polish army in the November 1830 Uprising and participated in the 1848 revolution. In spite of his mixed family background, he considered himself a Pole, so much so that he changed his surname to Pol. He was interned in Königsberg (Królewiec) after the fall of the November Uprising in Russian partition of Poland. He enrolled at the University but soon became embroiled in controversy, for his anti-Tsarist agitation. While Pol was defended by German speaking professors, Peter von Bohlen and Friedrich Wilhelm Schubert, he left Prussia and continued his exile in France. While in exile Pol worked on his first poems in tribute to the heroism of the insurgents, issued later in the set of \\"Songs of Janusz\\". Although he had no formal education in geography, during his travels in Polish lands he wrote several books on this subject, and in 1849 was appointed professor at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. He wrote a fine descriptive work, Obrazy z życia i podróży (Pictures of Life and Travel), and also a poem Pieśń o ziemi naszej (Song of our Land). In 1855 he published Mohort, a poem relating to the times of Stanisław August Poniatowski. His earlier Songs of Janusz (1836) inspired Frédéric Chopin to write a number of Polish songs, but only one survives. Pol was probably first to introduce into Polish literature the term \\"Kresy\\" to describe the territories lying near the eastern frontiers of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He died in Kraków. Pol was interred in Kraków's historic Skałka Church, a mini-pantheon of Polish scientists, writers and artists, especially from the Kraków area.

The thirteen towns that makes up Sagamu that congregated there in 1872 for greater security are : Offin ( where the Akarigbo's palace is situated), Makun, Sonyindo, Epe, Ibido, Igbepa, Ado, Oko, Ipoji, Batoro, Ijoku, Latawa and Ijagba.

Background Akarigbo of Remoland. The Obas of Remo have been in existence since the founding of the Ijebu Kingdom by a prince of Oyo named Obanta and the arrival of the Prince Akarigbo to the western area of the kingdom roughly around the early 16th century. The title given to the Obas of Remoland, Akarigbo, is in honor of this first prince of their line. The original seat of the Akarigbos was in the area of Remo near Offin, two towns located further to the west of the present seat of rulership. With the advent of the slave trade in Dahomey and the wars between the Chiefs of Abeokuta and the Kings of Dahomey, a mass exodus of Yorubas from the areas of Abeokuta and western Dahomey began to migrate eastward thus strengthening the control of the Akarigbos over the population of the area. Further adding to the instability, were the collapse of the Kingdom of Oyo to the north of the Ijebus and the Jihads of the Hausaland led by the Fulani Caliph Usman dan Fodio. To combat these threats, the Akarigbo and the leaders of various groups founded the present city of Sagamu as safehaven for persons fleeing the fighting in the north and west. Members of four ruling families are eligible to ascend the seat of the Akarigbo, these persons descending from four of the sons of the first Akarigbo. The present King of Remoland is His Royal Highness, Oba Babatunde Adewale Ajayi, Torungbuwa II, who ascended the throne on 7 December 2017 as the 19th Akarigbo of Remoland.

It is set in an alternate world in which Rome never fell, after Pontius Pilate pardons Joshua bar-Joseph (Christ), and the Romans win a decisive victory at Teutoburg Forest and Latinize Greater Germania. The World The world of the Germanicus trilogy is portrayed as being stagnant and technologically backwards compared to our timeline, a fact that Germanicus blames on the archaic imperial system of government. With a force of slave- labourers, Rome never industrialised, limiting the extent to which it can modernise. This means that technology advances only through necessity. One of the themes of the novel is the extent to which Rome has stagnated; the imperial system and government has remained virtually untouched for two thousand years. This becomes prevalent in the war against the Aztecae, during which Roman galleys, still reliant on boarding an enemy boat are decisively defeated by the Aztec/Serican fleet who utilise true battleships. This conflict provokes a major naval reorganization, and Roman battleships start to be developed. =Major Powers= Roman Empire Although inefficient and lethargic, Rome is the foremost power across Europe, and its territories extend into Africa and across the Atlantic to the Novo Provinces in America. The Pax Romana maintains peace, although German and Hiberian rebel movements are a constant threat to the Empire. The Empire has stagnated however, and the senators have become completely powerless and are unwilling to change the system. Germanicus, however, dedicates his rule as Caesar to restoring the Senate and Republic, believing that only that will hold together Rome in the future. *Leader: Emperor Fabius (Procurator), Emperor Germanicus Julius Aztecus Caesar (New Barbarians), Lord Regent Decimus Antonius Nepos (Cry Republic, acting as steward for Emperor Quintus Nero) Serican Empire Little is known about the Serican Empire. They conquered Nihonia (Japan) after a decisive naval battle and occupy much of Asia. They prefer to act through proxies, such as the Aztecae, and have started to extend their influence towards the east of America from their supposed colony in California, wishing to remove the Roman provinces there. Roman traders occasionally trade with them via the Silk Road. *Leader: Emperor of the Xing Aztecan Empire The Aztecan Empire was formerly the dominant power in explored America, taking tribute from much of Central America and demanding thousands of sacrifices. They refer to themselves as the Aztecae, and note that they used to call themselves Mexicae. Ultimately, the bloodthirsty nature of the Empire destroys it, as many of the oppressed tribes join the Roman legions in sacking Tenochtitlan. After the Empire was dismantled, it became the Roman province of Novo Brittania, under the rule of Procurator Khalid of Anatolia. *Leader: Nominally Emperor Maxtla, administrated by Lord Tizoc (New Barbarians), Procurator Khalid (Cry Republic) Books =Procurator= Procurator introduces us to the main character of the series, Germanicus Julius Agricola (later Germanicus Julius Agricola Caesar, then finally Germanicus Julius Agricola Aztecus Caesar). He is a military veteran, near retirement, and is installed as the procurator of the province of Anatolia. Germanicus fights against an uprising, supported by stories about the mental ability of \\"massing\\" by the zaims of Anatolia. Ultimately, a coup is revealed that kills Emperor Fabius, and most of the royal family. As the closest relative, Germanicus becomes Emperor and returns to Rome. Whether the power of \\"massing\\" exists or not is left vague by the novel. =New Barbarians= The Novo Provinces in Mexico and the Aztec Empire have been at an uneasy peace for some time, when, in preparation for a One-Reed Year, Emperor Maxtla launches war against the Roman colonies. As Emperor, Germanicus heads to the New World in order to command the Roman troops through the war. After being defeated in the Aztec Sea by Serican (Chinese) supported Aztec vessels, he arrives in the Novo Provinces with Tora, a captured Nihonian. Despite urgings from Rome, and from a native woman, Alope, Germanicus decides to not attack the central Aztec Empire, instead to simply push them out of the Novo Provinces. In order to force his hand, Alope surrenders herself to the Aztecs, so that she would be sacrificed. Germanicus, realising that both Epizelus and Alope are in danger continues to push the Aztecs back, until only Tenochtitlan remains. With help from Tora, he fords Lake Texcoco with sand-galleys, and sacks Tenochtitlan, only to discover that Alope has already been killed. =Cry Republic= Having returned from the Siege of Tenochtitlan, Germanicus starts trying to restore the power of the senate, in preparation for stepping down as Emperor and restoring the Roman Republic. However, Decimus Antonius Nepos decides to play on the fears of the senators and enacts a swift coup. Germanicus is rescued with the help of sewer-dwellers by Rolf and Tora, who then take him to safety. The three then go their separate ways; Germanicus looking for supporters or respite in Anatolia, Tora to the Serican (Chinese) Empire in the East, and Rolf returning to his native Germania. Rolf, convinced that without Germanicus, the Roman Empire doesn't deserve to continue, leads the German Gothic tribes in a revival, attacking the outposts of new Emperor Nepos. Germanicus, in Anatolia, starts looking for supporters, and, spurred on by a vision of Fabius, declares manumission, and gathers an army to fight Nepos. As Nepos heads to Masada to confront him, his rail-galley is destroyed in a German ambush led by Rolf, and Nepos himself killed. As Nepos' army breaks apart, Germanicus decides to head back to Rome to restore the Republic. Characters =Germanicus= Germanicus is a military veteran, and is planning to retire at the beginning of Procurator. However, when Emperor Fabius is killed, he is forced to become Emperor. Germanicus, although experienced, is somewhat of an idealist, dedicated to restoring the Roman Republic. Through New Barbarians, he plans to restore some provinces to senatorial control, and realizes that he may need to abandon the New World colonies through the turbulence as Rome makes the transition. When he is betrayed by Nepos, he becomes jaded and remarks that the name \\"Julius\\": \\"means nothing any more\\". However, supported by the Anatolian Mara, he gathers support and tries to take back the Empire. Germanicus' eventual fate is left unknown, though it is implied that he feels some respect towards the Anatolian/Jewish god (the last line of the series remarks that: \\"Caesar had knelt\\"). At the end of the series, Germanicus is surrounded by a loyal army of Jews and Anatolians, and Nepos' army is routed, leading rise to the possibility that he may try to take back Rome. =Rolf= A German soldier and legionary, Rolf is extremely loyal to Germanicus, fighting alongside him in Anatolia, against the Aztecs, and finally in his name against Nepos' empire. He finds himself torn between his German heritage and his Roman training. He admires Germanicus, and sees Roman soldiers as being courageous, unlike many other Goths but has contempt for the Roman patricians. Rolf's fate at the closing of the series is likewise unknown. He is scarred by a flamethrower wielded by Nepos, but his German soldiers believe that the wound is not fatal. Whether he remains as German Herzog or not is completely unknown. =Tora= From Serican-occupied Nihonia, Tora is an engineer and a scientist. He refers to himself as a follower of Yinshaya: a \\"total submission to reason\\". Tora is irritated by the fact that Rome has little understanding of technology: pretty much all modern technology was invented by former Emperor Fabius or the Greek Ptolemaeus. He develops a biplane between the Roman conquest of the Aztec Empire and Nepos' coup, called a cloud-galley by the Romans. Tora returns to the Serican Empire, where he becomes a vassal to the Xing Emperor, though remaining loyal enough to Germanicus to believe that he has survived and will regain his empire. =Minor Characters= Decimus Antonius Nepos Formerly Germanicus' praetorian prefect, Nepos seizes the opportunity to take the empire, and shows no regret when this action leads him to face Rolf with little hope of surviving. He says that Germanicus didn't \\"deserve\\" the Empire, because he couldn't hold onto it, ironic considering that neither could Nepos. Nepos is similar in many ways to Gaius Nero from New Barbarians in being praetorian prefect and seeking to become emperor, although Nero's plan is foiled whilst Nepos' succeeds in taking control of the Empire. Nepos is killed by Rolf, and his army routed. Colonel Crispa A Scandian colonel whom Germanicus falls in love with briefly in Procurator. She uses this to manipulate the native Anatolians into revolting against the empire as part of a plot to kill Fabius. Crispa is killed by Rolf on Germanicus' orders. Alope A Native American, Alope tries to use the Romans to destroy Maxtla's Empire and the Aztec domination of her people, the Indee. Knowing Germanicus' infatuation, she lures him to Tenochtitlan, but is killed on the sacrificial altar before the city is taken. Mara An Anatolian whom Germanicus meets when he flees to Anatolia. She looks after him, and joins with him when he gathers support to take back Rome. By the end of the series, Mara develops respect for Germanicus, but despite his feelings for her, still sees him as a pagan, and tells him that a union between them is impossible. Epizelus A Greek physician, Epizelus is Germanicus' personal physician in Procurator, becoming the chief scientific aide to him in New Barbarians. However, he is replaced by Tora in Cry Republic after leaving to recover from his ordeal with the Aztecs. Joshua Bar Joseph Although never appearing in any of the three books, and now long dead, Jesus of Nazareth is mentioned by many of the characters. It is implied that with Christianity stillborn in the Roman Empire, he travelled east into the Serican Empire. Germanicus hears that his pardon given by Pontius Pilate was critical to the Roman Empire's survival from an oracle, Tora mentions that his pseudo-religion of Yinshaya was founded by a Galilean holy man in the Serican Empire who he names as \\"Star-Sorter\\". Fabius Emperor Fabius is often mentioned during Procurator, as well as his numerous accomplishments; such as the sand-galley and the index (compass). Many soldiers announce themselves by saying \\"Hail Fabius\\" throughout Procurator. Fabius is portrayed as being less idealistic and more politically skilled than Germanicus, pointing out that he \\"survived twenty years on the Palatine\\" before his wife murdered him, whilst Germanicus didn't manage two. When Germanicus is ready to give up all hope in Anatolia, he sees a vision of Fabius who advises him to call for manumission to take back his empire. Technology Most modern technology was invented by the partnership of Emperor Fabius and Ptolemaeus or by Tora. Most technology is either named for old Roman equipment or, in the case of moving vehicles, the Roman seagoing galley. =Niter Pieces= Niter powder is this world's equivalent of gunpowder. It is used to fuel both handheld weapons and larger artillery. Pilum The pilum is a rifle, fueled by niter powder and the standard weapon for legionaries and praetorian guardsmen. Pilum is assumed to be the Roman term, since \\"Niter Piece\\", an obscure real world term, seems to be a more general name for such weapons. It is named for the Roman spear, the pilum. In New Barbarians the Aztecs previously had air-powered versions, which become gunpowder-powered thanks to Serican influence. Ballista A large artillery gun powered by niter powder, ballista are named for the ancient Roman siege bolt thrower. =Vehicles= Rail-Galley The equivalent of a train, rail-galleys are used to transport men and equipment across the vast Roman Empire, since automobiles are in their infancy. The Great Artery is a long railway running through Rome and heading all the way to Anatolia. Sand-Galley A large tracked \\"ship\\" like vehicle that was designed as a siege weapon by Emperor Fabius. It is similar to a real-world tank, although it is a good deal larger. The idea of it being a \\"sand-galley\\" is similar to Winston Churchill's description of tanks as \\"land-ships\\". Sand-Galleys are armed with a single ballista, which is designed to fire only straight ahead, as it was designed primarily as a siege weapon. When Germanicus has a vision of our timeline, he notices what seems to be an American tank, and at first mistakes it for a sand-galley. Cloud-Galley The prototype cloud-galley is invented by Tora between New Barbarians and Cry Republic. It is a biplane, powered by an internal combustion engine and (according to the cover illustrations), has a rear-facing propeller. Automobiles Lorries moving troops or laborers appear several times in fields. Tora notices their absence during his flight above Rome, noting that \\"by ancient decree\\", they are not permitted on Rome's streets early in the day. Ships Triremes, biremes and quinqueremes are all mentioned during New Barbarians. Rather than being defined by banks of oars, the names refer to the number of screw propellers on the boats. Despite being armed with near-modern equipment, the ships are still designed to be used as traditional Roman ships; boarding enemy galleys rather than attacking them directly. Contact with the Aztec/Serican fleet forces the Roman Empire to develop battleships for the first time during New Barbarians.

Because of this, the society may be described as the first political party in Denmark.

The Impact of Warfare and Military Reforms.\\" Acta Sociologica 47:71-89. Nordic Sociological Association. Bondevennerne were the strongest advocates of giving suffrage to all landowning men, and they would have preferred a unicameral system.Engelstoft, Povl (1949). \\"Den grundlovgivende rigsforsamling\\" in Fabricius, Knud; Frisch, Hartvig; Hjelholt, Holger; Mackeprang, M.; Møller, Andr.

However, the conservatives and in part the National Liberals insisted on a bicameral system with suffrage to the Landsting restricted on income and with some of the members appointed by the king. It is to a large degree thanks to Bondevennerne that the 1849 constitution became as democratic as was the case. In 1848, the society was via War Minister Tscherning represented in the first Danish government after the absolute monarchy, the Cabinet of Moltke I, a coalition government that spanned the political spectrum. The number of members peaked in the middle of the 1850s at approximately 10,000,Thorsen, Svend (1950). \\"Partisystemets gradvise udvikling\\" in Fabricius, Knud; Frisch, Hartvig; Hjelholt, Holger; Mackeprang, M.; Møller, Andr.

The society was represented in government for the second and last time in the Cabinet of Rotwitt 1859-1860. Although never formally dissolved, the society became part of the liberal party Det Forenede Venstre in 1872.

They are told from the perspective of Gemma Doyle, a girl in the late nineteenth century. The Gemma Doyle Trilogy consists of three books: A Great and Terrible Beauty (published December 9, 2003), Rebel Angels (published 2006), and The Sweet Far Thing (published December 26, 2007). Plot This series is a cross between period fiction and Fantasy. The story revolves around Gemma Doyle, a young woman sent from her home in British India to the boarding school, Spence Academy, after the mysterious death of her mother. There she meets Ann, Felicity, and Pippa, three other remarkable young women. Together, they discover the dark past of their school, which closely revolves around a mystical group referred to as The Order. In the first book, they find out that this group of sorceresses was forced to disband after one of their own, a woman named Sarah Rees-Toome, betrayed them. Throughout the series Gemma learns of her own heritage and the magical powers she possesses, including the ability to enter \\"The Realms,\\" a magical world in which dreams can become reality, but everything seems to have a cost. This series addresses some of the issues faced by women in the late 1800s, and creates parallels to issues faced by women today. There are many female characters, and the struggles they encounter on their journey to becoming empowered both within and outside of The Realms ring true. Other themes include dissecting dualities (in particular, the duality between good and evil;) free will versus fate; going against social norms; power; and, most of all, the concept of choice. The three books in the trilogy span just one year, with A Great and Terrible Beauty beginning in June 1895 and The Sweet Far Thing ending in June 1896. Characters Gemma Doyle, Felicity, Ann, Pippa, Mary Dowd, Kartik, Sarah Rees-Toome, Circe References to other literature A Great and Terrible Beauty refers to many literary classics. Among those mentioned are: *Persephone: Pippa is sometimes seen as being like the tragic, beautiful Greek Queen of the Underworld, who ate pomegranate seeds to stay in the Underworld, just as Pippa ate berries in the Realm Libba Bray's explanation of Pippa as Persephone *The Lady of Shalott by Tennyson: Miss Hester Asa Moore leads her art class in a discussion of the Elaine, The Lady of Shalott, and art based upon Tennyson's poem, in Chapter Nine. This poem has special significance for Ann and Pippa, who both see themselves as being trapped, as the lady was. Miss Moore states that the lady dies \\"because she lets herself float through [the] world.\\" Stanzas five, six, eight, and fifteen of The Lady of Shalott are also quoted, as a form of introduction, before Chapter One. *The Perils of Lucy, A Girl's Own Story: A fictional three-volume novel that Ann loves. Gemma thinks that stories like it (a popular staple of Victorian literature) about a \\"poor, timid girl\\" who is greatly put upon by her wicked peers, before eventually being found to be of noble birth, are \\"poppycock\\". As with The Lady of Shalott, the implication is that women, even in a male-dominated society, can only expect to be happy if they do something to make themselves happy, instead of sitting passively by. *The Odyssey: Kartik reads this in Rebel Angels. Gemma's adventures in Rebel Angels parallels some of Odysseus. Film In July, 2006, Icon Productions, the film production company run by Mel Gibson, announced that it would adapt the book into a film based on A Great and Terrible Beauty, to be written and directed by Charles Sturridge. People have been rumored to be playing the characters, but author Libba Bray has confirmed that no one has been cast. Author Libba Bray discusses the current status of the film on her webpage. In 2009, Bray announced that Icon relinquished the rights of the film, and so the film version of the book will not be made. References External links *Gemma Doyle Trilogy official web site.

She was the sister of fellow Irgun leader David Raziel. Biography =Early life= Raziel was born in Smarhoń (now in Hrodna Voblast, Belarus) in 1911, a year after her brother, David. Her household spoke Hebrew, as her parents refused to speak the more common Yiddish. In 1914, her family immigrated to Eretz Israel, after her father was offered a Hebrew teacher’s position at the “Tachmoni” school in Tel Aviv. However, when World War I began, the family was deported by the Ottomans, along with other Russian nationals, to Egypt. She moved back to Russia and returned to Palestine in 1923, after an 8-year absence. In 1932, she joined Betar and organized the \\"National Cells.\\" In 1935, she completed the Levinsky Teachers Seminary in Tel Aviv and moved to Jerusalem to work as a teacher, but was fired after being caught wearing a Betar insignia. She returned to Tel Aviv and took a \\"Lieutenants\\" course. =Irgun activity= In 1936, as the Arab Revolt began, she joined her brother in the Irgun. She took a first aid course and in August she took participated in a reprisal. In 1939 she became the first broadcaster of the Irgun's underground radio station, Kol Zion Halohemet, as well as a writer for Hamashkif, its newspaper. In 1943 she was selected to be a member of the Irgun's command structure. On March 4, 1944, the police raided her parents' house and found the radio transmitter. She was arrested along with her husband, Yehuda Naor, and was jailed in Bethlehem (Yehuda was taken to Acre and later deported to Africa, where he stayed for four and a half years, until the establishment of the State of Israel). She was pregnant at the time of her arrest and on August 18, 1944, after a seven-month internment, she was released and gave birth shortly after. She was placed under house arrest and was frequently investigated. On July 22, 1946, following the King David Hotel bombing, she was once again arrested and was sent to the Latrun detention camp, where she remained for several weeks. After her release she remained under strict surveillance and was prevented from continuing her underground activity. =State of Israel= After the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was accepted on November 29, 1947, she returned to Kol Zion. After the establishment of the State of Israel she was one of the founders of Herut, and was elected on its list as a member of the 1st through 7th Knessets. Throughout her 25-year service she was a member of the Knesset's Education and Culture Committee and the House Committee. In the election to the 8th Knesset she was replaced by Geula Cohen. She died on November 11, 2002, and was buried in Jerusalem.

IACC was developed to facilitate city-wide efforts in advocating personal character development . Funding for the program is primarily generated from the sale of materials and training.  Program  The City of Character program encourages cities to each month emphasize and focus on one of 49 character qualities, developed originally Tom Hill as an adaptation of character traits identified by Bill Gothard. The program was further developed by and is now administered by the Character Training Institute.http://www.characterfirst.comCharacter Qualities Calendar Some of the qualities taught include: Attentiveness, Dependability, Forgiveness, Gratefulness, Orderliness, Truthfulness, and Obedience. A full list of these character qualities can be found on the Character First! Web site.49 Character Qualities - Character First! The IACC and Character First! organizations produce character-based materials for various groups, including: Family, Business, Education (Elementary and High School), and Community. Character First! is not a religious program, but the materials can also be adapted for use in a religious setting. According to Character Training Institute and IACC advocate, Dr. Joseph Ahne, the program does use religious symbols and is \\"biblically based\\". Dr. Anhe states that “We use [ Character First! ], because we can’t take religion into schools and government. But it’s all based on the same thing.” Implementation of the program varies from symbolic to more devoted adherence, but based upon its adoption of the program, one city Tagaytay, Philippines, even requires completion of the Character First! program in order to receive a marriage license.Cult of Character - In These Times The cost of the program varies based on the materials purchased and training conferences utilized in the implementation.

As a disciple of Ulugh Beg, he is best known for the development of astronomical physics independent from natural philosophy, and for providing empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation in his treatise, Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy. In addition to his contributions to Ulugh Beg's famous work Zij-i-Sultani and to the founding of Sahn-ı Seman Medrese, one of the first centers for the study of various traditional Islamic sciences in the Ottoman caliphate, Ali Kuşçu was also the author of several scientific works and textbooks on astronomy. Ali Qushji's 15th-century tombstone located in the Eyüpsultan Mosque cemetery in Istanbul Biography =Early life and works= Ali Kuşçu was born in 1403 in the city of Samarkand, in present-day Uzbekistan. His full name at birth was Ala al-Dīn Ali ibn Muhammed al-Qushji. The last name Qushji derived from the Turkish term kuşçu—\\"falconer\\"—due to the fact that Ali's father Muhammad was the royal falconer of Ulugh Beg. Sources consider him Turkic\\"During the fifteenth century this method of representing decimal fractions came to be known outside the Islamic world as the Turkish method, after a Turkish colleague of al-Kashi, known as Ali Qushji, who provided an explanation.\\" Joseph, George Gheverghese (2010) The crest of the peacock: non-European roots of mathematics Princeton University Press, p. 469. , or Persian.G.

Ulugh Beg Observatory – Landmark of Ali Qushji's career He attended the courses of Qazi zadeh Rumi, Ghiyāth al-Dīn Jamshīd Kāshānī and Muin al-Dīn Kashi. He moved to Kerman, Iran (Persia), where he conducted some research on storms in the Oman sea. He completed Hall-e Eshkal-i Ghammar (Explanations of the Periods of the Moon) and Sharh-e Tajrid in Kirman. He moved to Herat and taught Molla Cami about astronomy (1423). After professing in Herat for a while, he returned to Samarkand. There he presented his work on the Moon to Ulugh Beg, who found it so fascinating that he read the entire work while standing up. Ulugh Beg assigned him to Ulugh Beg Observatory, which was called Samarkand Observatory at that time. Qushji worked there until Ulugh Beg was assassinated.Osmanlı imparatorluğunun doruğu 16. yüzyıl teknolojisi, Editor Prof. Dr. Kazım Çeçen, Istanbul 1999, Omaş ofset A.Ş. After Ulugh Beg's death, Ali Kuşçu went to Herat, Tashkent, and finally Tabriz where, around 1470, the Ak Koyunlu ruler Uzun Hasan sent him as a delegate to the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. At that time Husayn Bayqarah had come to reign in Herat but Qushji preferred Constantinople over Herat because of Sultan Mehmed's attitude toward scientists and intellectuals. =Constantinople era= When he came to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), his grandson Ghutb al-Dīn Muhammed had a son Mirim Çelebi who would be a great mathematician and astronomer in the future.G. Akovalı, Z. A. Mansūrov, The role of government and research institutes in the planning of research and development in some Central Asian and Caucasian republics, IOS Press, 2000,, , p.230, Ali Kuşçu composed \\"risalah dar hay’at\\" in Persian for Mehmed II at Constantinople in 1470.Mahārājā Mānasiṃha Pustaka Prakāśa, David Edwin Pingree, ”A descriptive catalogue of the Sanskrit astronomical manuscripts preserved at the Maharaja Man Singh II Museum in Jaipur, India\\", American Philosophical Society, 2003, p.138; Also he wrote \\"Sharh e resalye Fathiyeh\\", \\"resalye Mohammadiye\\" in Constantinople, which are in Arabic on the topic of mathematics. He then finished \\"Sharh e tejrid\\" on Nasir al-Din al- Tusi's \\"Tejrid al-kalam\\". That work is called \\"Sharh e Jadid\\" in scientific community. Contributions to astronomy Papers from Ali Qushji's scientific works. Qushji improved on Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's planetary model and presented an alternative planetary model for Mercury.George Saliba, \\"Arabic planetary theories after the eleventh century AD\\", in Rushdī Rāshid and Régis Morelon (1996), Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, pp. 58-127 [123-124], Routledge, . He was also one of the astronomers that were part of Ulugh Beg's team of researchers working at the Samarqand observatory and contributed towards the Zij-i-Sultani compiled there. In addition to his contributions to Zij, Ali Kuşçu wrote nine works in astronomy, two of them in Persian and seven in Arabic. A Latin translation of two of Qushji's works, the Tract on Arithmetic and Tract on Astronomy, was published by John Greaves in 1650. =Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy= His travel to the Ottoman Empire. Qushji's most important astronomical work is Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy. Under the influence of Islamic theologians who opposed the interference of Aristotelianism in astronomy, Qushji rejected Aristotelian physics and completely separated natural philosophy from Islamic astronomy, allowing astronomy to become a purely empirical and mathematical science. This allowed him to explore alternatives to the Aristotelian notion of a stationary Earth, as he explored the idea of a moving Earth instead (though Savage-Smith asserts that no Islamic astronomers proposed a heliocentric universe). He found empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation through his observation on comets and concluded, on the basis of empirical evidence rather than speculative philosophy, that the moving Earth theory is just as likely to be true as the stationary Earth theory.F. Jamil Ragep (2001), \\"Freeing Astronomy from Philosophy: An Aspect of Islamic Influence on Science\\", Osiris, 2nd Series, Vol. 16, Science in Theistic Contexts: Cognitive Dimensions, pp. 49-64, 66-71. His predecessor al-Tusi had previously realized that \\"the monoformity of falling bodies, and the uniformity of celestial motions,\\" both moved \\"in a single way\\", though he still relied on Aristotelian physics to provide \\"certain principles that only the natural philosophers could provide the astronomer.\\" Qushji took this concept further and proposed that \\"the astronomer had no need for Aristotelian physics and in fact should establish his own physical principles independently of the natural philosophers.\\" Alongside his rejection of Aristotle's concept of a stationary Earth, Qushji suggested that there was no need for astronomers to follow the Aristotelian notion of the heavenly bodies moving in uniform circular motion. Qushji's work was an important step away from Aristotelian physics and towards an independent astronomical physics. This is considered to be a \\"conceptual revolution\\" that had no precedent in European astronomy prior to the Copernican Revolution in the 16th century. Qushji's view on the Earth's motion was similar to the later views of Nicolaus Copernicus on this issue, though it is uncertain whether the former had any influence on the latter. However, it is likely that they both may have arrived at similar conclusions due to using the earlier work of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi as a basis. This is more of a possibility considering \\"the remarkable coincidence between a passage in De revolutionibus (I.8) and one in Ṭūsī’s Tadhkira (II.1[6]) in which Copernicus follows Ṭūsī’s objection to Ptolemy’s \\"proofs\\" of the Earth's immobility.\\" His works = Astronomy= * Sharḥ e Zîj e Ulugh Beg (In Persian) * Risāla fī Halle Eshkale Moadeleye Ghamar lil-Masir (Arabic) * Risāla fī aṣl al-Hâric yumkin fī al-sufliyyeyn (Arabic) * Sharḥ ʿalā al-tuḥfat al-shāhiyya fī al- hayāt (Arabic) * Risāla dar elm-i ḥeyāt (In Persian) * Al-Fatḥīya fī ʿilm al- hayʾa (in Arabic) * Risāla fi Hall-e Eshkal-i Ghammar (in Persian) * Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy (Arabic) Osmanlı Astronomi Literatürü Tarihi (Ed.

Italdesign showed an enduring commitment to exploring one-box designs, having preceded the Megagamma with the 1976 Alfa Romeo New York Taxi concept and followed the Megagamma with the 1982 Capsula, 2000 Maserati Buron and 2010 Proton Emas. The Megagamma itself presaged many attributes of the modern MPVs -- notably a roomy but compact, flexible cabin with a flat floor not unlike such notable antecedents as the Volkswagen Type 2 (1950) and the DKW Schnellaster (1949-1962) and such notable succeeding mini/compact MPV's as the Nissan Prairie (1981), Fiat 500L (2011) and Mitsubishi Chariot (1983) -- as well as a wide array of similarly-sized and larger MPV's including the Renault Espace, Honda Shuttle and Chrysler Minivans.

He has also contributed numerous invited entries in international handbooks and encyclopedias on literacy, critical literacy, and research methodology. He has served on numerous Australian state and national advisory groups in the area of literacy education, and was senior consultant on the national on-line curriculum initiative conducted by the Curriculum Corporation. He was 2015-2016 Chair of the International Literacy Association's Research Panel, and 2014 recipient of that Association's WS Gray award for contributions to literacy education internationally. Four Resources Model In the early 1990s, Allan Luke and Peter Freebody of Griffith University introduced the Four Resources Model in literacy education. This model seeks to reconcile the debates among Whole Language, Phonics, critical literacy and others. This model postulates that in order to be a fully literate citizen, a person needs: # coding competence (the ability to decode text, i.e. phonics) # semantic competence (the ability to make meaning, i.e. comprehension) # pragmatic competence (every day, functional literacy, i.e. writing a check, reading the newspaper, filling out a job application, etc.) # critical competence (the ability to critically select and analyze texts, i.e. avoiding scams, determining reliable sources of information, etc.) Luke and Freebody assert that no one of these resources is sufficient by itself but that each is essential. Further, the resources are not meant to indicate a sequence of instruction. Different resources should be present in instruction in varying amounts, depending upon the needs of the students. Luke has also stated that critical competence, far from being an upper level topic, can begin to be developed in year one of education and before.

Other parts of the duchies were ruled by the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. The territories of Holstein-Glückstadt are located in present-day Denmark and Germany. The main centre of administration was Segeberg and from 1648 Glückstadt (founded in 1617) on the River Elbe. History After the death of Frederick I of Denmark - who was also Duke of Schleswig and Holstein - his three sons partitioned the Duchies between them in 1544 whereby each of the three brothers received a part of both duchies: *The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein in Segeberg, held by King Christian III of Denmark and his successors, identical with the Kings of Denmark. From 1648 the royal parts of Schleswig and Holstein were administered out of Glückstadt, known as the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Glückstadt. Before 1773 its Holstein territory consisted of the following Ämter: Rendsburg, Southern Dithmarschen, Steinburg, Segeberg, and Plön. *The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein in Haderslev, held by Duke Hans the Elder. Hans had no issue and after his death in 1580, his territories were divided among his brothers. *The Duchy of Schleswig- Holstein in Gottorp, held by Duke Adolf and his successors. In addition, significant parts of Holstein were jointly administered by the Dukes of Holstein-Glückstadt and the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp, mainly on the Baltic Sea coast. In 1640, the County of Holstein-Pinneberg, whose ruling house was extinct, was merged into the royal part of the Duchy of Holstein. In 1713, the estates of the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp in Schleswig including Schloss Gottorf were conquered by royal Danish troops in the course of the Great Northern War and in the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg, Duke Charles Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp had to cede them to his liege lord the Danish crown. His remaining territories in Holstein formed the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp administered from Kiel. In 1773, Charles Frederick's grandson, Paul, Emperor of Russia finally gave his Holstein parts to the Danish king, in his function as duke of Holstein, in exchange for the County of Oldenburg and Holstein was reunited as a single state. List of statholders in Schleswig-Holstein-Glückstadt The Danish king in his function as duke of Holstein, and duke of Schleswig, appointed statholders (German: Statthalter; Latin: produx) to represent him in the duchies. The statholders fulfilled the tasks related to the ducal power as patrimonial lords in the royal shares of Holstein and Schleswig, as well as the royal part in the condominial government with the houses of Gottorp and Haderslev (the latter extinct in 1580) for all the duchies of Holstein (until retreat of Gottorp in 1773) and Schleswig (until Gottorp's deposal from dukedom there in 1720). *1545–1550: Johan Rantzau *1550–1556: Count Bertram von Ahlefeldt *1556–1598: Heinrich Rantzau *1598–1600: vacancy? *1600–1627: Geerd Rantzau (1558–1627)Dietrich Hermann Hegewisch, Schleswigs und Holsteins Geschichte unter dem Könige Christian IV und den Herzogen Friedrich II, Philipp, Johann Adolf und Friedrich III oder von 1588 bis 1648, Kiel: Neue Academische Buchhandlung, 1801, (=Wilhelm Ernst Christiani's Königlich-Dänischen wirklichen Justizraths und ordentlichen Professors der Weltweisheit, Beredsamkeit und Geschichte auf der Königl.

While no longer being produced or even officially hosted online, the collection consisted of approximately 15 volumes of largely abstract and surreal art, numbering over 1,000 images in total. Created in GIMP by Bowie J. Poag, the images were meant to attract users to the platform by virtue of the art having been 100% Linux-generated. The style of the images produced by Poag were unusual in terms of their geometric qualities. Appearing to repeat seamlessly along all four edges, PROPAGANDA images became attractive for use in 3D modeling, and particularly for use as desktop wallpaper, in that limitations in graphics hardware at the time often prevented users from using full screen 24-bit images. Using smaller, tileable images for desktop backgrounds helped keep memory utilization to a minimum, while still allowing early Linux desktops to be visually appealing. After ten months, Poag turned control of the project over to Naru Sundar who was then a student at the California Institute of Technology. Although Sundar would subsequently release two additional volumes, Poag terminated the project in April 2000 citing a lack of activity by Sundar, and a falling out with Chris DiBona, a manager of community projects at VA Linux Systems, who provided hosting space for his project. As a side source of amusement, PROPAGANDA's website featured a satirical storyline that John F. Kennedy had faked his own assassination in 1963, and had placed himself into cryogenic suspension until the time was right to lead the charge against Microsoft, and help the Linux movement gain footing.

History  The village was probably settled in the 14th century, but was first mentioned in a written document in 1525 as Zabrzech. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1277 in 1880 to 1598 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (between 96.1% in 1880 and 97.2% in 1910) accompanied by a small German- speaking minority (at most 3.4% in 1880) and Czech-speaking (at most 20 or 1.5% in 1900). In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (98%), followed by Jews (30 or 1.9%) and 2 Protestants. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. On the 27 May 1942 German soldiers executed by hanging 5 Polish civilians: Stefan Górecki, Alojzy Jarczok, Wilhelm Herok, Adolf and Jan Grygierczyk. Zabrzeg was liberated by the Red Army on 9 February 1945 after heavy fighting with Wehrmacht. After the war it was restored to Poland.  Landmarks  There are several landmarks in Zabrzeg, including the Saint Joseph parish church from the 18th century and the statue of Priest Józef Londzin.

The theatre was originally known as the Theatre Royal and Opera House and dates back to the 1770s. Today's theatre was designed in 1894 as the Wakefield Opera House, by theatre architect Frank Matcham, and was built for a price of £13,000. The Theatre Royal Wakefield is the smallest remaining of Matcham's theatres. In the 1920s the theatre had to compete against cinemas and in the summer live shows were replaced by films. In 1954 the theatre closed and became a picture house, and a few years later, a bingo hall. However, in 1981 it reopened as the Wakefield Theatre Royal under chairman Sir Rodney Walker. Support was given to revitalise the theatre from city leaders and music and drama amateurs and professionals. Theatre Royal Wakefield operates as both a producing and a receiving house. In 2011 British playwright John Godber joined the Theatre as Creative Director, and the Theatre now plays a producing role for The John Godber Company. Theatre Royal Wakefield works with young people, with its Performance Academy operating across two sites in Wakefield and Pontefract. It runs dance, music and drama training for children aged from 5 to 18, as well as its youth company, Wakefield Youth Music Theatre. In 2012 the Theatre applied for funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund for a £2.6 million project to restore the theatre building.

Biography  Bessie Harrison was born on July 5, 1890 to musician Edgar Thomas Harrison (1868-1924) and Claribel Harrison (née. Mead, 1873-1959). She had a brother, Elbert Harrison. Harrison married her first husband and namesake, actor Charles Eyton, on September 3, 1908. While attending a studio tour at Selig Polyscope Company, she was spotted by a director who wanted to cast her as an extra in a film. She made her film debut in The Sheriff of Tuolomne (1911) opposite Tom Mix. Although she made up to 200 films while signed to Selig, she is best known for her roles in The Spoilers (1914) and the 12-reel adaptation of Winston Churchill's The Crisis (1916). In addition to acting, she is also credited with being the screenwriter of the 1914 short The Smuggler's Sister. Bessie Eyton in Film Fun, June 1917 Eyton was one of Selig's biggest stars until the studio closed in 1918. Her career began to slow after that, and she only appeared in 9 films between 1919 and 1925, mostly for independent studios. In 1919, she made her stage debut in Civilian Clothes, which opened on September 12, 1919. Her final screen appearance was in The Girl of Gold (1925), starring Florence Vidor. Eyton married her second husband Clark Brewer Coffey on September 29, 1916, a year after her divorce from Charles Eyton. The marriage ended in divorce in 1923, and neither unions produced children. In 1935, following an argument with her mother, Eyton disappeared from her friends and family. Her whereabouts remained unknown until her death in 1965. Bessie Eyton died on January 22, 1965 in Thousand Oaks, California and was buried at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura, California.

The name honors U.S. paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn.  Description  Henricosborniidae is a group of primitive notoungulates assigned to the suborder Notioprogonia together with Notostylopidae, not because these two families share any derived features, but because they do not clearly belong to any other clade. The henricosborniids are only known from the late Paleocene and early Eocene (Itaboraian-Casamayoran SALMA, ), making them slightly older and more primitive than the notostylopids. The henricosborniid dentition is the most generalized and primitive of all notoungulates, and they are believed to be near the source of all notoungulates. They have low teeth crowns and the dental formula . George Gaylord Simpson noted that many of the mammals that Ameghino had, and Simpson himself did, describe from the Río Chico Formation, on the Atlantic coast of Patagonia, are very difficult to distinguish from each other, both on genus and family levels. Often these mammalian groups, including the henricosborniids, are only known from one or a few isolated teeth found only at a single location. Each one of these teeth most likely represents a separate species but these species can not be properly described unless some comparable material is found. synonymized (\\"= or including\\") many of the species named by Ameghino and others. Among other things, McKenna & Bell included Postpithecus in Othneilmarshia. Simpsonotus, with two species found in the Mealla Formation in the Jujuy Province in northwestern Argentina, are the most complete henricosborniids found. Based on features in their auditory region, they might be the most primitive notoungulates discovered. On the other hand, if these primitive features are shared by the other members of the family, argued that the family should perhaps be recognized as a distinct suborder.

She was the founding director of the earliest Learning Center as part of the Mental Health Service at a public hospital. She was the author of books and producer of films to guide in prevention and remediation of learning problems. Early life Dr. Pope was born in Manhattan, but grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. She attended Brooklyn College, transferring to Hunter College, where she received her BA. Immediately after graduating college in 1937, at the age of 19, she began working as a teacher in public schools. Career During her professional career as a teacher, she was elected to the office of Vice President of the Vocational High School Teachers Association as well as to the office of Vice President of the Teachers Union. In the 1940s, equipment was lacking for effective teaching, class sizes were abnormally large, and trade teachers taught eight periods daily compared to their academic colleagues who carried a five period daily load. Her efforts led to reduced class sizes and teaching loads, and to improved equipment in the shop classes. She left the public school system in 1952 and earned a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology at New York University. After several years as an Educational Psychologist in a hospital setting, she pioneered in establishing the first Learning Center in a mental health setting in this country (and arguably in the world) for students with learning problems. A mental health setting is important because emotional problems often interfere with learning and, conversely, difficulty in learning causes emotional problems. Her center served as a model for many that followed. She worked closely with the schools, guiding teachers, paraprofessionals, volunteers and parents in how to help their students become readers. Working in an impoverished area in Coney Island, she employed and trained neighborhood women to assist in this work; the beneficial impact on them, as on the children whom they served, was enormous. A number of these women went back to school and gained careers in education. While there, she employed the Bread and Puppet Theatre as part of the therapeutic program for children served by the clinic. She retired from the mental health center as Associate Chief of Child Psychiatry. Dr. Pope, Diplomate in School Psychology, has served as a consultant to educational and mental health agencies, and as Adjunct Professor at Brooklyn College and New York University. Later life She has published many books, as well as papers in professional journals, and her speaking engagements and workshops have been numerous. Importantly, she was the Keynote Speaker at the International Conference of the United Electrical Workers; her address was published as a pamphlet by the United Electrical Workers and also translated into Spanish, as a guide to the workers on how to understand and deal with the learning problems of their children. She also was the Keynote Speaker several times at the Atlantic Conference on Learning Disabilities in Halifax, Canada, and conducted training workshops there as well. She produced three 16 mm. films, and The Psycho-Educational Battery, circulated on request to teachers in the United States and Canada; these guided teachers in diagnosing and remediating the needs of learners who need assistance. As Educational Director and Vice-President of the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation, Dr. Pope facilitated thousands of programs in schools and public libraries in the 50 states by providing grants for programs that encourage literacy, creativity, and joy in learning. Her published material (books, tests, and papers), as well as the instructional films that she produced reside in the archives of the Tamiment Library at New York University. She was married to Martin Pope. Honors and awards Honoree, The Clara Lemlich Award for Social Activism, 2011, which honors women who have been working for the larger good all their lives.

History After six years in the band, Jim Beattie left Primal Scream in 1988. Two years later he formed Spirea X, the name taken from a Primal Scream b-side (an instrumental track that he had written), announcing \\"We're going to do it...by having better songs, better melodies, better arrangements, better everything. By sheer force of ideas\\". The band's first demo prompted 4AD to sign them, their first release eagerly anticipated, with BBC Two's Snub TV featuring an interview with them and a couple of live tracks before they had released a single. The band's original bass player and guitarist (The McGovern brothers) soon left, with guitarist Robert forming cult underground Glasgow indie punk band Dresden and his bass playing brother Tony becoming a well established member of Glasgow band Texas. Jamie O'Donnell and Thomas McGurk joining Beattie, his girlfriend Judith Boyle, and Andy Kerr in 1991. Debut EP Chlorine Dream was released in April 1991, the title track inspired by the life of Brian Jones. This was followed up by \\"Speed Reaction\\" and the album Fireblade Skies (the name taken from a volume of Arthur Rimbaud's poetry), both in 1991. Fireblade Skies met with positive critical reaction, Lime Lizard's Nick Terry stating: \\"If Jim Beattie's last longplaying endeavour, Primal Scream's Sonic Flower Groove, was a thoroughly flawed masterpiece, he's found his groove with Fireblade Skies\\".Terry, Nick (1991) \\"Fireblade Skies (review)\\", Lime Lizard, November 1991, p.48 Beattie was known for his self-confidence, verging on arrogance, once proclaiming himself to be God, and stating \\"David Icke is my bestest friend\\",Terry, Nick (1991) \\"Spirea X: Nothing Happened Yesterday\\", Lime Lizard, November 1991, p.64-66 later saying \\"Yeah, I thought I was God before, but now I feel more like Jesus\\".Robb, John (1991) \\"XDirectory (Spirea X feature)\\", Indiecator, Issue 3, p. 48-49 Beattie rejected comparisons with other bands of the era, stating \\"I don't think we fit in anywhere, really\\", and \\"I don't think we're egotistical like Ride are. I don't need to be egotistical, because I've got the music to back it up\\".

The Walhonding Canal was a canal in Coshocton County, Ohio that was used as a feeder canal for the Ohio and Erie Canal. A small canal, at only long, it was wholly contained within Coshocton County, following the Mohican River from Cavallo south to the confluence with the Kokosing River, which together with the Mohican forms the Walhonding River. The canal followed the Walhonding River southeast toward Coshocton where it met the Ohio and Erie Canal in Roscoe Village.  Establishment and construction  Building of the Walhonding Canal commenced in 1836 and finished in 1842. William H. Price, Charles J. Ward, John Waddle, Jacob Blickensderfer, Henry Fields and Sylvester Medbery were among the members of the engineering corps responsible for the Walhonding Canal. Several of these men also served as contractors on the Ohio and Erie Canal. In addition to these were John Frew, S. Moffit, Isaac Means, John Crowley, W. K. Johnson and others. It cost $607,268.99, or an average of $24,290.76 per mile.Hill Jr., N.N. (1881). History of Coshocton County, Ohio: Its past and present, 1740-1881. Newark, Ohio: A. A. Graham & Co., Publishers. pp. 286-287. The Superintendents of the Walhonding canal were Langdon Hogle, John Perry, William E. Mead and Charles H. Johnson. The first canal boat launched in the county was called the \\"Renfrew\\" in honor of James Renfrew, a merchant of Coshocton. It was built by Thomas Butler Lewis, an old Ohio keel- boatman.  Extensions  It was intended to have the Walhonding canal extended to the northwestern part of Ohio, but there was already much talk of speedier mode of conveyance in 1842. The work being very expensive, and the members of the legislature from districts where canals were no longer regarded as practicable were unwilling to support the necessary appropriations. Two years after initial approval of the canal, the Board of Public Works lobbied for authorization of extensions for the canal. One proposal was a extension north along the Mohican River and the other proposal was a extension west along the Kokosing River toward Mount Vernon in Knox County. By 1844 the lobbyists for extensions realized neither would gain approval and they soon stopped requesting appropriations. The extensions up the Kokosing River to Mount Vernon and north along the Mohican River to Loudonville was first authorized by the Ohio General Assembly on March 10, 1838. The extension to Mount Vernon was contingent on the Mount Vernon Lateral Canal Company surrendering to the state their charter, rights, and privileges that would have interfered with the state of Ohio's interest in construction of the canal. The extensions would have to be surveyed and approved by the Ohio Board of Public Works before construction could begin and they would have to operate at cost seven years after completion.Ohio General Assembly. (1838). Acts of a local nature, passed at the first session of the Thirty-Sixth General Assembly of the State of Ohio, begun and held in the City of Columbus, December 4, 1837. Volume XXXVI. Columbus: Samuel Medary, Printer to the State. pp. 221-222.  Railroad controversy  Traffic began to slow as other modes of transportation began to improve and need for the canal dwindled. In 1889, the Pennsylvania Company organized the Walhonding Valley Railroad that would follow the route of the canal from Coshocton to Loudonville. The Walhonding Valley Railroad was soon consolidated with the Northwestern Ohio Railroad, which formed the Toledo, Walhonding Valley and Ohio Railroad. The railroad was completed four years after the organization of the Walhonding Valley Railroad and it used some canal property on its right-of-way as it built the railroad, an action which led to a legal dispute. Allegedly, the Pennsylvania Company had not obtained a warrant from the state in the early 1890s to use the abandoned canal property, though the railroad's attorneys stated that the Ohio Board of Public Works had given them a permit. No record of such a permit existed in the board's transactions, however. The Ohio Canal Commission and a legislative committee both investigated the proceedings in late 1892 and early 1893 and concluded that the railroad was occupying the state's canal property without permission. In the spring of 1893, the Ohio Legislature finally passed a resolution that directed the Ohio Attorney General, Republican John K. Richards, to bring proceedings in ouster against the Walhonding Railroad Company. The state's Canal Commission adopted a similar resolution in March 1893, asking Richards to bring suit in this case. An article in The New York Times reported that as of September 3, 1893, the railroad had been occupying the state's canal property for more than a year and it had been six months without an action on the part of Attorney General Richards or the Republican- controlled Board of Public Works. The New York Times article used this example as a means to illustrate how the author believed Republican control of the state government of Ohio was leading to corruption and destruction of public works.The New York Times. September 3, 1893. Only the public suffers: Illustrations of Republican misrule in the State of Ohio. Accessed online: 31 December 2007. A suit was finally brought against the railroad company (by now the Toledo, Walhonding Valley and Ohio Railroad) by Attorney General Richards and was taken to the Supreme Court of Ohio. In order to settle the dispute, the legislature stepped in and passed an act (House Bill number 560) on May 14, 1894 that affirmed an agreement between the railroad and the canal commission. In the agreement, the railroad received the perpetual right to maintain its existing right-of-way on the berme bank of the canal and existing bridges over the canal for the sum of $5,000 in rents and tolls to the state. In return for this agreement, the state was allowed to at any time request the railroad move its right-of-way or raise the height of its bridges over the canals to the standard height of to allow for proper canal traffic.Ohio General Assembly.

Volume XCI. Norwalk, Ohio: Published by State Authority. The Laning PTG. Co., State Printers. pp. 232-234.  Abandonment  The state officially abandoned the Walhonding Canal in 1896 and the railroad that took its place continued to operate until 1936 when the Mohawk Dam was built for flood control, effectively cutting off the right-of-way.

Unlike the mercury-in-glass thermometer, the contents of an alcohol thermometer are less toxic and will evaporate quickly. The ethanol version is the most widely used due to the low cost and relatively low hazard posed by the liquid in case of breakage. An organic liquid is contained in a glass bulb which is connected to a capillary of the same glass and the end is sealed with an expansion bulb. The space above the liquid is a mixture of nitrogen and the vapor of the liquid. For the working temperature range, the meniscus or interface between the liquid is within the capillary. With increasing temperature, the volume of liquid expands and the meniscus moves up the capillary. The position of the meniscus shows the temperature against an inscribed scale. The liquid used can be pure ethanol, toluene, kerosene or isoamyl acetate, depending on manufacturer and working temperature range. Since these are transparent, the liquid is made more visible by the addition of a red or blue dye. One half of the glass containing the capillary is usually enamelled white or yellow to give a background for reading the scale. The range of usefulness of the thermometer is set by the boiling point of the liquid used. In the case of the ethanol-filled thermometer, the upper limit for measurement is 78 °C (172.4 °F), which makes it useful for measuring daytime, nighttime and body temperatures, although not for anything much hotter than these. Ethanol-filled thermometers are used in preference to mercury for meteorological measurements of minimum temperatures and can be used down to −70 °C (−94 °F).British Standard 692:1990 Specification for Meteorological Thermometers The physical limitation of the ability of a thermometer to measure low temperature is the freezing point of the liquid used. Ethanol freezes at −114.9 °C (−174.82 °F). If an alcohol thermometer utilizes a combination of ethyl alcohol, toluene, and pentane, its lower temperature range may be extended to measure temperatures down to as low as −200 °C (−328 °F). However, the measurement temperature range c. −200 °C to 78 °C, is highly dependent upon the type of alcohol used. History The alcohol thermometer was the earliest efficient, modern-style instrument of temperature measurement. As is the case with many early, important inventions, several people are credited with the invention. These include Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who in 1654 made sealed tubes partly filled with alcohol or urine, with a bulb and stem, depending on the expansion of a liquid, and independent of air pressure.R.

The club has already had two other Hungarian players (Dániel Tőzsér and Balázs Tóth). It was uncertain if KRC Genk would continue with Köteles as the Hungarian has had some flaws in a few games, but in the play-offs of the Belgian league he got back to his regular level. In a small amount of time, Köteles has gained a lot of popularity with Genk fans due to his enthusiastic style of goalkeeping and the interaction with the fans, making them think of the legendary and unmatched popular goalkeeper István Brockhauser (also Hungarian) when the latter was first goalkeeper at KRC Genk, back in the nineties. On 23 August 2011 Köteles played an important role in qualifying for the group stages of the UEFA Champions League 2011–12 season. Genk beat Maccabi Haifa 4–1 on penalties. Köteles saved the penalties of Vladimir Dvalishvili and Eyal Golasa. On 13 September 2011 Köteles debuted in the UEFA Champions League against Valencia. Köteles kept a clean sheet since the result was a goalless draw. On 1 November 2011 Köteles saved the penalty shot by David Luiz and contributed to the second point gained in the UEFA Champions League 2011–12 season for Genk against Chelsea F.C..

The screenplay was written by Peter Viertel and it starred Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner, Mel Ferrer, and Errol Flynn. Much of it was filmed on location in France and Spain in Cinemascope and color by Deluxe. A highlight of the film is the famous \\"running of the bulls\\" in Pamplona, Spain and two bullfights.. Cast * Tyrone Power as Jake Barnes * Ava Gardner as Lady Brett Ashley * Mel Ferrer as Robert Cohn * Errol Flynn as Mike Campbell * Eddie Albert as Bill Gorton * Gregory Ratoff as Count Mippipopolous * Juliette Gréco as Georgette Aubin * Marcel Dalio as Zizi * Henry Daniell as Army doctor * Bob Cunningham as Harris * Danik Patisson as Marie * Robert Evans as Pedro Romero Production notes =Development= Film rights to the novel were sold in the late 1920s for a reported $10,000. These rights were transferred to Hemingway's first wife, Hadley Richardson, by the author at the time of their divorce, so he never personally benefited from the sale. Originally the film was going to be made at RKO, possibly starring Ann Harding. In 1940 agent-producer Charles Feldman bought the rights from Harding's one-time husband, actor Harry Bannister, for a reported $35,000. In 1948, it was announced Howard Hawks had bought the film rights. He subsequently sold part of his interest to Feldman, but the project did not go beyond the development stage. In 1955, Hawks and Feldman sold the rights of the novel to Darryl F. Zanuck at 20th Century Fox, who still hoped to use Hawks as director. This was part of a deal whereby Feldman sold his interest in a number of projects to Fox – the others included Heaven Knows, Mr Allison, The Wayward Bus and Oh Men! Oh Women!. Of this deal, the rights to The Sun Also Rises were estimated at $125,000. Zanuck hired Peter Viertel to write the script. Viertel later reflected: > The long lapse of time since the book was published will not cause it to > lose its value. The story is ageless. It should renew its impact for our > modern generation. It is fascinating in its impressions of Europe after > World War I, because so many of these impressions are duplicated again > today. =Casting= Zanuck wanted the lead played by Gregory Peck, who had previously appeared in several Hemingway adaptations, including the popular The Snows of Kilimanjaro. Jennifer Jones signed to play Lady Brett. The movie became the first to be produced for Zanuck's own independent production company following his departure from Fox (although Fox would still distribute). Cinematographer Charles Clarke started filming bullfighting sequences in Pamplona in June 1956. Henry King signed to direct and Walter Reisch to produce. Jennifer Jones had to pull out from the film because of her commitment to make A Farewell to Arms for her husband David O. Selznick. Dana Wynter and Robert Stack were mentioned as possible leads. Ava Gardner was announced for the female lead, but then pulled out to make Thieves Market with William Wyler, so Susan Hayward was cast in her place. However, Hemingway insisted that Gardner play Lady Brett so Zanuck went after her and succeeded in getting her to sign. \\"I am convinced Lady Brett Ashley is the most interesting character I have ever played\\", said Gardner. Zanuck later claimed that the casting of Gardner forced the film to be postponed from September 1956 to February 1957. This meant the film could not actually be shot in Pamplona \\"unless we wanted to shoot a fiesta in the snow\\". It was decided to film it in Mexico instead. In February 1957, Tyrone Power signed to play the male lead. Mel Ferrer then joined, followed by Eddie Albert and Errol Flynn. Singer Juliette Gréco was also given a role after being spotted singing in a cafe by Mel Ferrer and Audrey Hepburn. Walter Reisch withdrew as producer because of his other commitments to Fox and Zanuck decided to produce the movie personally. Producer Darryl F. Zanuck spotted suit salesman Robert Evans at the El Morocco and decided to cast him as the young bullfighter Pedro Romero in the film. He did this against the wishes of co-stars Ava Gardner and Tyrone Power, as well as Hemingway himself.High Beam Research. \\"Robert Evans biopic studies producer fated to the screen\\", May 23, 2003. Accessed: June 29, 2013. Zanuck overruled all involved, and Evans – who later became a popular producer himself – used Zanuck's response as the title for his 1994 biography, The Kid Stays in the Picture.Naugle, Judge Patrick . DVD Verdict: The Kid Stays in the Picture, August 4, 2003. Accessed: July 20, 2013. =Production= Filming started March 1957 in Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico. (It had been intended to shoot in Pamplona but the trees were not in foliage and the production could not afford to wait.) There was also shooting in Spain and France. Although Hemingway's novel had an undefined \\"mid 1920s\\" setting when it was published in 1926, the film adaptation places the story around 1922. The film uses the song \\"You Do Something To Me\\" as a motif, which was not written until 1929. Zanuck had originally intended to shoot some scenes on the Fox backlot in Hollywood but changed his mind and took the unit to Paris and Biarritz instead. This added an estimated $250,000 to the budget. Reception =Hemingway reaction= Ernest Hemingway saw the film but walked out after 25 minutes stating: > I saw as much of Darryl Zanuck's splashy Cook's tour of Europe's lost > generation bistros, bullfights, and more bistros... It's pretty > disappointing and that's being gracious. Most of my story was set in > Pamplona so they shot the film in Mexico. You're meant to be in Spain and > all you see walking around are nothing but Mexicans... It looked pretty > silly. The bulls were mighty small for a start, and it looked like they had > big horns on them for the day. I guess the best thing about the film was > Errol Flynn. \\"That was a kind of lousy thing to say about my picture before the reviews came out\\", said Zanuck: > I think a writer is entitled to criticize if there is a complete distortion. > But if he sees that there has been a serious attempt to put his story on the > screen, even if it failed in some instances, he doesn't have the right to > destroy publicly something he's been paid money for... Over 60% of the > dialogue in the picture is out of Hemingway's book... We treated it as > something Holy... We showed the script to him and he made some changes. We > even showed it to him again after the changes were made... If the picture > doesn't satisfy Hemingway he should read the book again... because the book > won't satisfy him... I don't think he saw the picture. I think someone told > him about it. Flynn's performance was highly acclaimed and led to a series of roles where he played alcoholics.Thomas, Tony and Rudy Behlmer & Clifford McCarty, The Films of Errol Flynn, Citadel Press, 1969 p 212-213. =Critical= Filmink magazine later wrote that \\"For the most part, the handling of the movie is wrong, wrong, wrong; indeed, some of it is downright hideous... The treatment is too reverential when it needs to be a film about real, breathing people.\\" Later version A later film version of the novel, directed by James Goldstone, was made for American television as a 2-part mini-series in 1984.

In the 1690s, Shadrach was renting the Coalbrookdale ironworks and supplying shot (for cannon) to the Board of Ordnance. He had some dispute with the Company for Making Iron with Pitcoal. His brother Thomas Fox had worked that company as founder near London, casting grenado shells and shot for the Board in 1693, after which Thomas became warden of the Fleet Prison, in which he stored 'bombs and grenado shells', probably ones empty of gunpowder. In 1701 he placed his brother in charge of another blast furnace, at Wombridge to which Isaac Hawkins supplied a large quantity of coal and ironstone, which suggests that they smelted iron with coke. Unfortunately, Coalbrookdale Furnace blew up, not later than April 1703, and Thomas died not long after. Coalbrookdale Furnace remained derelict until it was restored by Abraham Darby in 1709.P. W.

Ontical refers to a particular area of Being, whereas ontological ought to refer to Being as such. The history of ontology in Western philosophy is, in Heidegger's terms, properly speaking, ontical, and ontology ought to designate fundamental ontology. He says \\"Ontological inquiry is indeed more primordial, as over against the ontical inquiry of the positive sciences\\".Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, §3. It is from this distinction he developed his project of fundamental ontology (German: Fundamentalontologie) Background The project of fundamental ontology appeared as a result of Heidegger's decision to re-interpret phenomenology, which he had developed earlier in collaboration with his mentor Edmund Husserl, using a neat set of ontological categories. For this project Heidegger had to look for new terminologies by means of which it would become possible for him adequately to represent the structure of his new brand of phenomenology. The significantly large change in terminology Heidegger made in the project also resulted in a reconsideration and redefinition of many traditional concepts. For instance, the thesis that a phenomenon is the essence of a thing could not be articulated by using traditional concepts alone; in fact, Heidegger consistently refused to use these concepts in their original (i.e. Husserl's) senses. He re-interpreted such basic philosophical categories as \\"subject\\", \\"object\\", \\"spirit\\", \\"body\\", \\"consciousness\\", \\"reality\\" and others with a new emphasis on Being (German: Sein), showing their inadequacy for his new philosophical explorations. Moreover, Heidegger went on to separate his pursuit of \\"ontology\\" from the kinds of inquiry that previous researches of \\"essence\\" had conducted under the same label, which henceforth, according to Heidegger, should be engaged only in particular fields of science. For Heidegger, the ontical forms of research conducted by scientists presuppose the regional-ontological, which in turn presupposes the fundamental-ontological. As he expresses it: > The question of Being aims… at ascertaining the a priori conditions not only > for the possibility of the sciences which examine beings as beings of such > and such a type, and, in doing so, already operate with an understanding of > Being, but also for the possibility of those ontologies themselves which are > prior to the ontical sciences and which provide their foundations. > Basically, all ontology, no matter how rich and firmly compacted a system of > categories it has at its disposal, remains blind and perverted from its > ownmost aim, if it has not first adequately clarified the meaning of Being, > and conceived this clarification as its fundamental task.Martin Heidegger, > Being and Time, §3. Earlier philosophers, namely ancient ones,Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, §1. have stated that only in phenomenon was it possible to posit the essence of things. Thus the phenomenon was opposed to essence, and it was the moment of opposition of the subject and object. Husserl had differentiated his new notion of phenomenon from the traditionally accepted notion of phenomenon as \\"occurrence\\". The notion of \\"phenomenon\\" as introduced by Husserl in his phenomenology carries in itself the two faces of things: phenomenon as \\"representation of the world as it is reflected in consciousness\\" and the essence of a thing \\"as it is in itself\\". In Husserl's belief, 'phenomenon' as he defined it appeared comprehensive and sufficient for his philosophical ventures. Husserl's perspective, as Heidegger saw it, left some room for new development in phenomenology: bringing \\"ontology\\" into \\"phenomenology\\" with a new force. For Heidegger, Husserl's ideas were \\"in exile\\" with their transcendental tendency, because they were exclusively concerned with consciousness, and they had to be \\"thrown\\" back into the historical, external world. From the Heidegger's point of view the attempt of his mentor to design and save life only inside human consciousness, i.e. \\"the world above\\" of the transcendental ego, was not sufficient. Thus, the first task that Heidegger took on was to work out how to refute Husserl's immanence of consciousness while preserving all the achievements of his mentor's phenomenology. On the other hand, why did Heidegger want to base his \\"new phenomenology\\" only on the category of Being, and to set as his task a formulation and proof of it? Answering this question, he again refers to the phenomenological maxim: without any intention to address directly \\"things\\" (German: zur Sache selbst), then what kind of intellectual outlook will be at all possible? To Heidegger the necessary focus is clear: Being in its various forms. Really, I exist, things surrounding me exist, and people surrounding me exist. Here it is important to understand that being is primary; things, I, and people, for instance, are all forms of being. Being reveals itself first of all in its multiplicity, in the form of separate essences (German: Seiendes). Today there are only two ontological alternatives in philosophy: the \\"objectivistic\\" variant of philosophy which was carefully developed by Nicolai Hartmann, and the \\"subjectivistic\\" fundamental ontology of Heidegger. For a variety of reasons, recently, the majority of philosophers give preference to the second, to Heidegger's alternative. Relationship with Dasein Heidegger argues \\"Dasein is an entity which does not just occur among other entities. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it\\".Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, §4. Human beings are in a privileged position to understand fundamental ontology. See also * Foundation ontology * Meta-ontology  Notes   References  * Heidegger, Martin (1997).

The French troops were defeated and withdrew to Hamburg. Site It occurred near what is now the site of the Göhrde State Forest (Staatsforst Göhrde), near Dannenberg, near Lüneburg. At that time this area belonged to the electorate of Braunschweig-Lüneburg (Hanover), which had been occupied by the French since 1803. The battlefield lies on the border between the modern-day districts of Lüneburg and Lüchow-Dannenberg, between Oldendorf an der Göhrde and Göhrde. Context In spring 1813, Russian troops under Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn forced the French out of Hamburg and some northern areas of Hanover. In the wake of Prussia's reentry into the war against France, the eastern areas of Hanover also rose against Napoleon. Wallmoden then received overall command of all the Allied troops on the Lower Elbe: troops from Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Hanover, Hamburg, Mecklenburg and Sweden, including the Russian German legion, the Lützow Free Corps, the Hanseatic Legion and a part of the King's German Legion, under the overall command of Generalleutnant Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn. Part of the British contingent was the newly formed Rocket Brigade under Capt Richard Bogue. On 7 September Bogue marched with half his brigade to join the main Army of the North, near Wittenburg. The other half of the brigade, under Lieut Thomas Fox Strangways,a nephew of the 2nd Earl of Ilchester joined the 4th Cavalry Division of General von Dornberg under General Wallmoden.Page 173, II, L Ludlow Beamish, History of the Kings German Legion in 2 vols The Free Corps such as that from Lützow again and again attacked French supply lines and bases in the area around Mecklenburg, south of the Elbe. The XIII Corps there, under marshal Davout, had up to this point behaved quite passively, restricting itself to holding Wallmoden's corps in check. As an anti-skirmishes measure, in September Davout sent general Pécheux on the western Elbufer with a brigade of 50th infantry division and moved on Lüneburg with 3,000 troops. After completing his mission, Pécheux was ordered to rejoin the French troops in Magdeburg. Wallmoden's corps advanced on Dömitz on 15 September with 12,300 men, crossed the Elbe, marched toward the Frenchmen and set up camp in Dannenberg. Course Attack of 3rd KGL Hussars & Rocket Battery The French division under Pécheux decided to attack the allies. On the early afternoon of 18 September 1813, it reached the Steinker Höhen (Steinker Heights) in Nahrendorf and gave battle. Whilst Wallmoden's infantry attacked the centre, Dornberg with the KGL cavalry and artillery attacked the enemy's left. However, Dornberg brought the guns and rockets into action at too great a range; their fire was ineffective and General Lyon's infantry attack was held up. The French began to retire, formed in squares, and Strangways advanced to bring the rockets into action “close under the fire of the enemy’s infantry”.London Gazette, 1813 No 16784 – Walmoden’s dispatch The 3rd KGL Hussars broke two squares and the rockets spread such terror through the retiring ranks that order could no longer be preserved, and breaking, the French fled in all directions.Pages 194-198, II, Ludlow Beamish Results The battle was the first victory over the French troops garrisoning Germany, and interrupted the link between XIII Corps under marshal Davout (with its headquarters in Hamburg) and Napoleon's main army (then in Saxony) and the French armies' supply-lines across Hanover from France to Magdeburg and Berlin. This result was critical for the outcome of the Battle of Leipzig soon afterwards. This was the first battle in which the newly developed Congreve Rocket had been successfully deployed in action. At the Battle of Leipzig, The Rocket Brigade, under Bogue and Strangways, would make a significant attack whilst attached to the Swedish Corps of Crown Prince Bernadotte. Commemorations Memorial A large stone monument stands as a memorial to the battle in 1839, at a site now north of Bundesstraße 216 about 2 km behind Oldendorf in Richtung Dannenberg. 1000 dead soldiers from both sides were buried in a mass grave in the forest, 100m from where the memorial is sited. This grave was rediscovered in 1985. Rudolf von Bennigsen's father Karl von Bennigsen fought in this battle (as a lieutenant), as did the famous freedom fighter Eleonore Prochaska. She had disguised herself as a man and joined the Lützow Free Corps. During the battle she was wounded and soon afterwards succumbed to her injuries in the hospital at Dannenberg. A reconstruction of the battle occurs every two years at Dahlenburg. At the Heimatmuseum in the town a diorama of the battle is on permanent display, with 1500 tin soldiers.

Mesotheriids were small to medium-sized herbivorous mammals adapted for digging. Characteristics Mesotheriids were small to medium-sized notoungulates; larger forms were approximately the size of a sheep (Shockey et al., 2007). Additionally, the family is characterized by specializations of the teeth and skeleton. In the dentition, all mesotheriids have ever-growing incisors with enamel restricted to the anterior surface, a condition termed gliriform, as it also occurs in Glires (rodents and lagomorphs). The cheek teeth (premolars and molars) of mesotheriids are high-crowned (hypsodont) and in advanced members of the family, the cheek teeth are also ever-growing (Shockey et al., 2007). Mesotheriid skeletons are heavily built and show features associated with digging in living mammals. In particular, fossorial characteristics of mesotheriids include deeply fissured claws, presence of a sesamoid bone in the elbow and reinforcement of the pelvic girdle by addition of vertebrae to the sacrum and fusion of the sacrum and innominate (Shockey et al., 2007). Behavior A biomechanical study of the skeleton of three mesotheriid genera (Trachytherus, Plesiotypotherium, and Mesotherium) spanning the temporal range of the family indicates that most or all mesotheriids were adapted for digging (Shockey et al., 2007). Shockey et al. concluded that mesotheriids likely dug for roots and tubers and were most similar in their diet and behavior to living wombats, although no living group is perfectly analogous. Extensive burrowing was considered possible but unlikely given the relatively large size of most mesotheriids. Geographic and temporal distribution As with almost all other notoungulates, mesotheriids are known only from the Cenozoic of South America (McKenna and Bell, 1997). Unlike some other families, mesotheriid fossils are not found across the continent. Instead, mesotheriids are most abundant and diverse in faunas from middle latitudes in Bolivia and Chile, particularly the Altiplano (Flynn et al., 2005). Mesotheriid fossils are rare in high latitude Patagonian faunas and absent entirely from tropical faunas in northern South America. The earliest potential record of a mesotheriid is ?Trachytherus mendocensis from the late EoceneShockey and Flynn, 2007, p.24 or early OligoceneReguero and Castro, 2004 Divisadero Largo Formation of Mendoza Province, Argentina (Shockey et al., 2007), but Cerdeño et al. (2006) have suggested that this specimen may actually derive from early Miocene rocks that overlie the Divisadero Largo Formation. The earliest secure records of the family come from the late Oligocene, when the family is represented by the genera Anatrachytherus and Trachytherus from Argentina and Bolivia (Reguero and Castro, 2004). The family reached its greatest diversity in the Miocene (Flynn et al., 2005), and mesotheriids persisted into the middle Pleistocene, in the form of the type genus, Mesotherium (McKenna and Bell, 1997). Mesotheriidae was one of only three notoungulate families to persist into the Quaternary, the others being Hegetotheriidae and Toxodontidae. Classification Within the order Notoungulata, Mesotheriidae is placed in the suborder Typotheria (Cifelli, 1993). In fact, Typotheria is named for the genus Typotherium, a synonym of Mesotherium (Shockey et al., 2007). In addition to Mesotheriidae, Typotheria traditionally includes other small bodied notoungulates in the families Oldfieldthomasiidae, Interatheriidae, and Archaeopithecidae (Simpson, 1967; McKenna and Bell, 1997). Recent opinion, however, favors inclusion of two additional families in Typotheria, Archaeohyracidae and Hegetotheriidae (Croft and Anaya, 2006). These families have traditionally been placed in a separate suborder, Hegetotheria, but phylogenetic studies indicate that their exclusion would render Typotheria paraphyletic (Cifelli, 1993; Billet et al., 2007). Within Typotheria, both Cifelli and Billet et al. indicate that mesotheriids are more closely related to archaeohyracids and hegetotheriids than to the remaining typotherian families. In fact, Billet et al.'s analysis indicates that both Mesotheriidae and Hegetotheriidae originated from within Archaeohyracidae. McKenna and Bell (1997) recognized three subfamilies within Mesotheriidae: Fiandraiinae, Mesotheriinae, and Trachytheriinae. However, Flynn et al. (2005) have suggested that Fiandraia, the only known fiandraiine, is not a mesotheriid and may represent a toxodontid instead. Of the remaining subfamilies, Trachytheriinae includes earlier (Eocene and Oligocene) forms and may be paraphyletic with respect to Mesotheriinae, which includes more derived genera from the Miocene and later (Reguero and Castro, 2004).

It is a prequel to Swordbird which was published in February 2007. Plot There is war in the kingdom of birds, which was started by the prehistoric birds known as the archaeopteryxes. In the only place where birds are still safe, a magical island called Kauria, the King, Pepheroh the Phoenix, orders his birds to make a sword as a result of what the Great Spirit tells him. Once the sword had been forged, a tear gem from the Great Spirit, a godly entity watching over birds, lands in the hilt of the sword, and seven other gems, each a color of the rainbow, are scattered around the world. These gems are the Leasorn Gems, and hold clues to where the magical kingdom of Kauria and the sword are found. A bird destined to be a hero will take hold of the sword at the fifth full moon three years from then and rescue the warring world. However, should the sword fall into evil hands, the world of birdkind shall be in peril. Hungrias the Second, Ancient Wing (or king) of the archaeopteryxes, sends Sir Maldeor, his top knights, and his son, Prince Phaethon, to a tribe of doves, who have the orange Leasorn Gem. The mission fails, as a monstrous four-winged bird/reptile creature attacks and eats Phaethon, who was in possession of the orange gem. The creature bursts into blue flames and Maldeor sends his troops to kill all the remaining doves. However, a dove named Irene manages to escape and lays an egg. When the egg hatches to reveal a fully feathered hatchling, she names him Wind-Voice. Meanwhile, the four-winged creature, named Yin Soul, is stuck between the world of the living and that of the dead, and can only escape if he can find the body of a likely hero that can get the Hero Sword, or else he will die a painful death. Yin Soul attempts to take control of Wind-Voice, but Wind-Voice sees through Yin Soul's illusion and refuses. Before meeting Yin Soul, it was revealed that Wind-Voice's mother had been killed, and he was made a slave. Wind-Voice later meets a wood-pecker scribe named Ewingerale, nicknamed Winger. Winger had been imprisoned after his tribe was destroyed. The archaeptyx were planning on fattening Winger up and eating him for supper. Wind-Voice breaks Winger out, is attacked by an archaeopteryx guard, and is brought to Hungrias, where he is put over a spit to cook for supper. On the spit, after he faints from the heat and is brought to Yin Soul's realm, Wind-Voice escapes and meets Fisher, a battle scarred crane, in a tribe in the surrounding swamp, as well as Winger. Fisher begins to teach Wind-Voice how to fight with a sword and later tells him of the Leasorn Gems. Wind-Voice is determined to find the gems and finding the hero, who will bring peace to the world. Before leaving to find the gems, Fisher gives them a map to finding Fleydur, who will help them on their journey. Also coming along is Stormac; a myna who can't resist his temptation for riches. Wind-Voice, Winger, and Stormac meet a golden eagle, who is revealed to be Fleydur. The group head out into the desert and battle a group of an archaeopteryx, who are in possession of the red Leasorn. Winger and Fleydur manage to escape with the gem, but Stormac is mortally wounded and is later found by a group of parrots, who heal him with the use of there green leasorn. Wind-Voice has been captured and taken to the castle of the archaeopteryx, where Maldeor is the new emperor. Maldeor is revealed to be Yin Soul's apprentice and had wing chopped off and then exiled by Hungrias for losing Prince Phaethon. After nearly dying in a blizzard, Yin Soul summons Maldeor and gives him a new, bat like wing. But the wing needs a potion every new moon to keep it going. Maldeor goes to Hungrias, takes the throne and then kills him. Maldeor throws Wind-Voice in the dungeon and later attempts to have him executed by tying him to a log and throwing him off a waterfall. Wind-Voice survives and meets up with Stormac, who now has the green Learson gem. The two go to Sword Mountain and gain the purple gem. Meanwhile, Winger and Fleydur are heading over the ocean the land of the penguins in search of the teal Learson. Along the way Fleydur reveals that he is actually a prince exiled from his home of Sword Mountain because of his belief that music can bring joy and healing to the world. Wind-Voice and Stormac are also heading over the ocean and end up in the Island of the Pirates, where they find the blue Learson gem and on Byrdsfish Island; the seagull tribe. Stormac is attacked and killed by a group of pirates led by Captain Rag-Foot and Wind-Voice heads alone to Kauria. Yin Soul attempts to take control of Maldeor but is rebuffed and left to die. Later Maldeor launches an attack for Kauria, but ends up in the land of the penguins and most of the forces are defeated or killed. Maldeor and his remaining army head to Kauria, where he sees a recently reunited Wind-Voice, Winger, and Fleydur. An army of free birds arrive to battle against the archaeptyx forces. Wind- Voice and Maldeor both head to the island and the two begin to battle. Wind- Voice escapes from the fight and manages to find the Hero's Sword, but doesn't take it. Maldeor however has taken a false Hero's Sword and attacks Wind- Voice. The real Hero's Sword appearance in Wind-Voices claws and Maldeor is killed when the temple that they are in begins to fall apart. The archaeopteryx army leave and begin to form their own tribes and Fleydur is taken back into his family. Wind-Voice is renamed Swordbird by King Pepheroh and it is revealed that Wind-Voice's father is the Great Spirit. The clues on the Leasorn Gems disappear and the day that Wind-Voice became Swordbird is made a holiday called the Bright Moon Festival. Swordbird reveals to Winger in a dream that he too was killed by the rubble and that he is now a spirit and a guardian of peace, and will help any that summon him. Reviews The book has received mostly positive reviews, Laura Ruttig, Children's Literature said \\"Birds form the unusual topic of this quest novel, which begins with a prophecy that foretells the coming of a great hero. The archaeopteryxes’ dark empire is growing, and they have turned even the strongest species of birds, such as the crows, into slaves. 013-Unidentified, a strange white bird, is held in their captivity at the start of the book. As he struggles to free a fellow prisoner, he suddenly recalls the name his mother gave him, Wind-Voice. He escapes and grows strong again, reclaiming his true identity as Wind-Voice. Throughout the novel, he journeys across the land to stop the evil Maldeor from reaching the Hero's Sword. This is a novel about recognizing the hero within and understanding what is truly important in life—such as family, friends, and peace, rather than power or treasure. Yi Fan's writing is outstanding given her young age. I also loved Rioux's exceptional pencil-drawn illustrations, which bring charming life to the characters. Together, they make this book an entertaining flight of the imagination.\\" Robyn Gioia, School Library Journal said \\"In this good-versus-evil story, a prequel to Swordbird (HarperCollins, 2007), readers see a legend taking shape as evil forces attempt to conquer the inhabitants of a bird world. Prophecy says a hero will emerge on Hero's Day, but no one knows who it will be. Scattered in unknown regions of the world lay strategically placed Leasorn gems that hold clues to where the hero's sword waits. It is up to the hero to discover where and to retrieve it. The archaeopteryxes, an army of birds intent on cruelty and destruction, support the desires of the villainous leaders. Maldeor, a leader with a batlike wing forged from evil magic, has cast his eye toward claiming the sword. But unlikely birds lay down their lives to uncover the clues so they might save the sword for its true master. Fleydur, eagle prince of the Skythunder tribe, Stormac the mynah, and Ewingerale the woodpecker all play pivotal roles as companions to 013-Unidentified, a dovelike bird trapped as a slave. Readers will find the characters credible and well suited for their roles in this fabled adventure. The tightly crafted story line is nicely executed, but the most important element, and one that truly touches the heart, is the underlying theme of love.\\" and by Sarah Sawtelle, Kidsreads said \\"SWORD QUEST is a thrilling adventure brimming with equal amounts of suspense and hope. Nancy Yi Fan’s prose and creativity take flight in this exciting prequel to the 2007 bestseller SWORDBIRD. We hope that this is just the beginning of a long and fruitful career for this talented teenage author.\\" Other critics noticed that it is better than her last novel, but say that the dialog is acquired, and that the story drags and stumbles along at a terrible pace.

Commemorative stamp on Vallal Pachaiyappa was released 31 March 2010.  Early life  Pachaiyappa Mudaliar was born in Periyapalaiyam in Thiruvallur district. Invited to Madras by dubash Narayana Pillai, he became a dubash at the age of 16 and amassed a fortune by the time he was 21. Ramanuja Kavirayar had written Pancharatnamala on Pachaiyappa Mudaliar.  As dubash  A protégé of Narayana Pillai, Pachaiyappa Mudaliar rose to dubash-ship soon after the demise of his mentor. During the same time, his employers the Powney family comprising the brothers Henry Powney and Thomas Powney rose to Mayorship of Madras. This increased the stature of Pachaiyappa Mudaliar and he emerged as one of the richest and most powerful men in Madras city.  Lifestyle  Despite being one of the richest men in the city, Pachaiyappa Mudaliar led a simple and austere lifestyle. He built a house at No. 26, Pagoda Street in the year 1790. There, he lived until his death. His life has been the subject of a detailed biography by one of his contemporaries. Witnesses recall that Pachaiyappa Mudaliar would bathe in the Coovum every day along with his affluent neighbours before worshipping at the temple at Komaleeswaranpet. He was a frequent workshipper in Kanchipuram Ekambaranatha Temple, and contributed for Temple renovation at his own expense. His statue could be seen in Kanchi Ekambareswarar temple's pillar. A similar Ekambareswarar temple was built in Parry's corner (Old: George Town), Chennai in order to reduce the travel time to Kanchi. He divided his time between Chennai and Thanjavur and used to travel to his village regularly. During the journey, he used to stop for days at Chidambaram to pray at the famous Hindu temple.  Death  Pachaiyappa Mudaliar's health deteriorated rapidly and one such visit to Thanjavur in 1794 he fell ill at Kumbakonam and died at Tiruvaiyaru on 31 March 1794.  Will  Pachaiyappa Mudaliar was one of the first Indians to leave a will. He had set aside Rs. 4.5 lakh of what he had left to be spent on Hindu religious institutions and the remaining Rs. 7 lakh on providing an English education to Hindu youth. (\\"At the time of his death his fortune was estimated at five lakhs of pagodas or 1.7 million rupees\\" Reference: The Dubashes of Madras by Susan Neild-Basu (1984)). The bequests, however, remained contested even after that and it was 1909 before the courts appointed a board of trustees and formulated a scheme for the smooth running of the trust. As the 1990s dawned, it was reported that the Trust was worth over 4,500 crores, one of the biggest in that part of the world. Apart from administering religious charities from Kanyakumari to Varanasi, it ran six colleges, a polytechnic and 16 schools in Tamil Nadu, helped several medical facilities and owned several properties in the State. The Pachaiyappa's College is one institution for which Pachaiyappa Mudaliar became well known. This college was established as Pachaiyappa's Central Institution at Popham's Broadway on 1 January 1842 from the funds, Pachaiyappa Mudaliar had allocated to charities as per the contents of his will. In 1856, the institution shifted to its own premises at China Bazaar. It became a school in 1850 and a college in 1889. The Pachaiyappa's Central Institution is the first non-missionary, non-British-financed education institution in South India.

Many mammals formerly extirpated in the state have returned, sometimes with active human projects and sometimes through a natural expansion from neighboring states as Connecticut's natural environment has become more welcoming to them. Many mammal species were removed from Connecticut or almost became extinct within the state through hunting and clearing forests to create farmland, starting in the 17th century with European colonization and continuing until the 19th century, when most of the state's forest covering had been replaced with farmland. Populations of moose, turkeys, black bears and mountain lions lost their habitats and were greatly reduced or eliminated in Connecticut. Pollution in the 19th and 20th centuries also played a role in either greatly reducing or extirpating some species, such as the bald eagle. With the collapse of farming in the 19th century and its continued decline in the state in the 20th century, forests spread back over much of the land. They are not the same forests, however: Chestnut trees, for instance, wiped out by a disease, are not nearly as prevalent as they once were, and the lack of their nuts affects the populations of various mammals. Stone walls, built largely in the 19th century, provide more welcoming homes to certain species; and mammals from Europe, including the house mouse and Norway rat, and from elsewhere (such as the coyote) can create a different competitive environment for some species and a different food source for some (the barn owl, for instance, can now feed on Norway rats). To some extent, deforestation and fragmentation of forests has occurred in recent decades with expanded residential development. Some improvements have come with the removal of certain industries from Connecticut since the mid-20th century and the installation of more sewage treatment plants and improvements in their functioning. Residual industrial pollution remains, however, and prevailing winds keep Connecticut on the receiving end of pollution from the New York City metropolitan area and other areas south and west of the state, Connecticut also continues to produce some of its own pollution.Hammerson, Geoffrey, Connecticut Wildlife: Biodiversity, Natural History, and Conservation, University Press of New England: Hanover, New Hampshire, and London, 2004, , Chapter 1: \\"The Landacape\\", pp 1–10 Dead animals killed by cars on the state's roads are one of the primary ways state residents see diverse varieties of local mammals. The more common roadkill in Connecticut consists of striped skunks, opossums, raccoons, and gray squirrels.Hammerson, Geoffrey, Connecticut Wildlife: Biodiversity, Natural History, and Conservation, University Press of New England: Hanover, New Hampshire, and London, 2004, , Chapter 21: \\"Mammals\\", pp 379–404 Species (This list of species concentrates on the habitats in the state in which they can be found, how prevalent they are or have been in the state, history of their prevalence in Connecticut and any other information directly related to the mammals' existence in the state — including laws and regulations, state- sponsored re-introductions, and notable sitings. Descriptions of the species or other, more general information not related to Connecticut can be found by following the links to Wikipedia articles on the individual species.) Opossums (Order Didelphimorphia, Family Didelphidae) * Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) — common in wooded areas, farmland, drier areas of wetlands, rural areas and in some other habitats in the state; came to Connecticut from the south in the early 20th century, a movement likely helped by its attraction to human-created food sources such as crops and trash, although it eats just about anything, including carrion. Many are run over on Connecticut roads. =Shrews and moles= Northern short-tailed shrew Shrews (Order Eulipotyphla, Family Soricidae) * Northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) — very common in leafy or grassy ground (usually in wooded areas) * Smoky shrew (Sorex fumeus) — common, especially in moist, shady spots * Masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) — plentiful in the state,Desmarais, Paul, \\"Photo Journal: Wilds of Suburbia\\" photograph (of a masked shrew in Bethel, Connecticut) with long caption, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, October 30, 2007, page A11, Norwalk edition especially in moist, shady spots. * Water shrew (Sorex palustris) — uncommon; found near water * Least shrew (Cryptotis parva) — rare in Connecticut, where the species reaches its eastern limit and close to its northern limit (it is also in central New York state); in this state, only found in coastal areas with high beach dunes and neighboring brackish marshes; Web page titled \\"Least Shrew\\", at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 all other shrews in the state have much longer tails (at least as long as the rest of their bodies). As of late 2007, the species was the only mammal listed on the Connecticut endangered species list, Web page titled \\"Endangered and Threatened Species Fact Sheets\\", at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 and it was the first mammal ever put on the list. The greatest threat facing least shrews in the state is land development along the coast, which limits the land available for the species and isolates breeding populations. Other threats are pesticides and pollutants contaminating food and habitat. The animal was first identified in Darien, Connecticut, in 1840 by Reverend James H. Linsley, but not seen again for 100 years. In 1941, George Goodwin, assistant curator of mammals at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City, found one in Westbrook at the edge of a saltgrass meadow. The animal again went without documented sightings until it was found in 1989 in coastal Middlesex County in 1989. As of 2007, this is the only documented Connecticut location of the species. Star-nosed mole Moles (Order Eulipotyphla, Family Talpidae) * Eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) — common in the state; usually found in fields, lawns and wooded areas that aren't too wet; much less prevalent in higher elevations in the northern parts of the state * Star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) — common in wet or moist soils near water, less common in upland areas that are moist; apparently active at ground level during the night (when wildlife expert Geoffrey A. Hammerson found 583 samples of food items in a sample of barn owl pellets in central Connecticut, 24 of them were star-nosed moles; none were eastern moles) * Hairy-tailed mole (Parascalops breweri) — somewhat common in well-drained areas in northwestern part of the state =Bats= Bats (Order Chiroptera, Family Vespertilionidae) The state has eight extant species of bats, plus at least one which may now be extirpated from the state. Because some bats have rabies, the state Department of Environmental Protection (now DEEP) advises on its Web site: :\\"If a bat has bitten or scratched a person or a pet, or is found in a situation where exposure cannot be ruled out, contact the DEP Wildlife Division at (860) 424-3011 or DEP Emergency Dispatch at (860) 424-3333 for advice. An example of a situation where exposure cannot be ruled out is when a bat is found in the same room as a sleeping individual or a very young child.\\" Web page titled \\"Dealing with Distressed Bats\\" at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 Bats that occupy buildings: * Little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) — common and widespread in the state; this and the big brown bat are the two most common bat species in the state Web page titled \\"Bats\\" at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 * Big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) — winters in the state, often hibernating in buildings, occasionally caves; a bat seen in winter is probably this species; in summer it often roosts in attics; it breeds in the state. Bats that roost in trees in summer: * Silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) — uncommon; usually seen near water; listed as a Connecticut species of special concern * Red bat (Lasiurus borealis) — usually found at lower elevations; seldom seen and listed as a Connecticut species of special concern * Hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) — seldom seen and listed as a Connecticut species of special concern * Northern long-eared myotis or long- eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) Bats that hibernate in caves and tunnels: * Northern long-eared myotis (see above) * Little brown bat (see above) * Eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii) — believed to have been extirpated in the state, and it was probably always scarce; no confirmed sightings have been recorded in the state for several decades; listed by the state as a \\"species of special concern\\" * Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) — in the several decades up to 2004, only one was ever found in the state; the bat is on both state and federal lists of endangered species * Tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus or Pipistrellus subflavus) =Rabbits and hares= Snowshoe hare Rabbits and hares (Order Lagomorpha, Family Leporidae) * Eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) — introduced to New England in the late 1800s and has expanded its range at the expense of the native New England cottontail.Desmarais, Paul, \\"Photo Journal: Wilds of Suburbia\\" photograph (of an Eastern cottontail rabbit) with long caption, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, October 2, 2007, page A11, Norwalk edition, caption states: \\"Sources: Nature Works (a Web site), Texas Tech University's online guide and Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection\\" The species originally came from the south. By the 1930s, New England cottontails were still considered more numerous than the eastern cottontail, but both species were declining as farms reverted to forests;[ ]Web page titled \\"Cottontail Rabbits\\" at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 found in shrubby and open areas, often in disturbed areas. Hammonasset Beach State Park has many of them; in the early evening, 30 to 40 can be found along the entrance road. * New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) — native but now relatively uncommon since in most places the eastern cottontail has replaced it; it appears to be more common in the west-central and southeastern parts of the state; generally found in shrubby wetlands and forests with dense plant life near the ground. Another possible reason for the decline of this species could be the loss of areas with suitable ground cover, which protects the animals from predators. Loss of farmland to forests is thought to have reduced the population since the 1930s, when New England cottontails were still thought to outnumber eastern cottontails. * Snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) — common in the northern part of the state, usually where there are dense thickets; the population in Connecticut doesn't soar cyclically, as the species does farther north =Rodents= Eastern gray squirrel American red squirrel Squirrel family (Order Rodentia, Family Sciuridae) * Groundhog, woodchuck or whistle pig (Marmota monax) — scarce when Europeans first came to North America, but they have thrived since then.Desmarais, Paul, \\"Photo Journal: Wilds of Suburbia\\" photograph (of a groundhog in Stamford, Connecticut) with long caption, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, September 4, 2007, page A11, Norwalk and Stamford editions * Eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) — the most frequently seen mammal in Connecticut and the largest squirrel found in the state. Acorn production can fluctuate greatly from year to year, affecting the squirrel population. Historically, there have been reports of large migrations of squirrels, including one in 1933 involving at least 1,000 gray squirrels swimming across the Connecticut River between Hartford and Essex. Limited food supply probably causes these migrations, although the exact causes are unknown. Web page titled \\"Gray Squirrel\\" at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 In Stratford, white squirrels, a local variant of the species, had been seen for years as of 2010 in different sections of town. Many had some light gray or reddish color and black eyes, indicating they were not albinos.Burgeson, John, \\"White squirrels return to the area\\", p A9, August \`13, 2010, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut * American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) — found usually in spots with stands of mature conifers, including white pine or eastern hemlock, but even in those areas there are usually fewer than one individual per acre; * Southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) — common where there are nut trees and available nesting cavities, often near streams and wetlands * Northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) — present in just a few areas in northern Connecticut; usually old-growth forests * Eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) — common in woods * Fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) - Introduced in the 1900s. Now is absent from the state. Beavers (Order Rodentia, Family Castoridae) Beaver * North American beaver (Castor canadensis) — found in small and large low-gradient streams, including tidal parts of the lower Connecticut River, as well as lakes and other water that is both permanently present and deep enough not to freeze all the way to the bottom in winter; most common where its favorite food plants are (such as aspen, birch, willow, cottonwood and soft aquatic plants); they not only dam up smaller streams but can be found in rivers too big to be dammed; common in the state before the arrival of Europeans; trapping led to their extirpation in the state by about 1842, then reintroduced, first in Union in 1914, and at other times up to the 1950s. They thrived so well that in 1961, the first state-regulated trapping season began in order to manage their numbers in light of growing nuissance complaints; Web page titled \\"Beaver\\" at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 the population is large enough now to be trapped, and generally 500 to 1,000 are trapped each year; in the 2001–2002 season a record 1,224 were trapped; in 2000 it was estimated there were between 5,000 and 8,000 beavers in the state; they can annoy homeowners with their tree cutting and flooding from their dams (which help some species but hurt others); in Connecticut, people must get a permit from their town wetlands commission before altering beaver dams to prevent or reduce flooding Mice, rats, voles, lemmings (Order Rodentia, Family Muridae) Muskrat * White-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) — common in woods and especially along forest edges; particularly where there are plenty of nuts or large seeds; * Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) — found in the northern part of the state * Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) — once existed at one site in western part of the state but now extirpated; it has also disappeared from many areas in the Northeastern United States * Southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) — common in the state, especially in forests with plenty of ground cover such as logs, rocks or old stone walls * Meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) — often found in abundance in pastures, meadows, marshes or wherever there is thick, unmowed grasses or sedges * Woodland vole (Microtus pinetorum) — common in the state; found mostly in partly wooded uplands * Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) — common in ponds, lakes, slow-moviing streams, canals, swamps and marshes * Southern bog lemming (Synaptomys cooperi) — usually lives along the edges of bogs, but also sometimes found in shady uplands with thick humus soil * House mouse (Mus musculus) — common in cities and farms, associated with people and farmland; comes from Europe * Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) — common wherever it can find food, such as at farms, in cities, near garbage dumps or waterfront areas; comes from Europe; barn owls near the New Haven landfill often feed on them Jumping mice (Order Rodentia, Family Dipodidae, Subfamily Zapodinae) North American porcupine * Meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius) — rather common in Connecticut in areas with thick vegetation, including meadows but also old fields, forest edges, often near water * Woodland jumping mouse (Napaeozapus insignis) — rather common in Connecticut in moist, forested areas or spots with thick shrubs, usually along streams New World porcupines (Order Rodentia, Family Erethizontidae) * North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) — uncommon in forested areas in the northern part of the state; usually found in mixed forests including eastern hemlock. Porcupines are most common in northern Litchfield County, especially the towns of Hartland, Colebrook, and Norfolk. It is not uncommon to see them as roadkill along Route 8 through the towns of Winchester and Colebrook. =Carnivorans= Dogs, wolves, coyotes, and foxes (Order Carnivora, Family Canidae) Red fox * Coyote (Canis latrans) — first spotted in Connecticut in the mid-1950s, with the first 10 years of reports only in the northwestern part of the state, although they have since spread across the entire state.

DEP annual bear surveys began in 2001.Benson, Judy, \\"State biologists keep track of bear population\\", article originally published by Hartford Courant; distributed by the Associated Press; article found in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, March 23, 2008, p A14 They were extirpated from the state by 1840, but the DEP had hard evidence of a resident population in the 1980s.The total population as of 2015 is expected at 800. Web page titled \\"Black Bear> at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 Since then sightings have increased dramatically. In 1997, the DEP received about 100 calls reporting bear sightings; in 2007, it received 2,000. The state DEP encourages bear reports on its Web site. Reforestation of the state was the major factor allowing for the reintroduction and expansion of the bear population, and that expansion is expected to continue. State policy is not to remove bears unless the area is urban; the agency seldom relocates bears and only does so within Connecticut, since no other state will accept them. Bears that persistently kill livestock, enter buildings or demonstrate similarly problematic behavior may be killed under state policy. There is no hunting season for bears in the state. The DEP asks people who see bears in Connecticut to do the following: \\"Enjoy it from a distance.\\" \\"Never attempt to feed or attract bears.\\" \\"Report bear sightings to the Wildlife Division, at (860) 675-8130.\\" Raccoons and relatives (Order Carnivora, Family Procyonidae) Raccoon * Raccoon (Procyon lotor) — found near lakes, ponds, marshes and streams; a rabies epidemic devastated the population in the state in the early 1990s, killing as much as 75 percent of the population; raccoon rabies still remains in Connecticut, with about 200 cases a year as of 2004, and including skunk and cat infections as well as raccoons; rabies cases should be reported to police or animal control officials Weasels and otters (Order Carnivora, Family Mustelidae) * River otter (Lontra canadensis) — previously scarce, but now somewhat common in the state; found in many lakes and large ponds * Mink (Neovison vison) — rather common in streams, ponds, lakes and marshes * Sea mink (Neovison macrodon) - now extinct, but may have lived along the coast of the state in the 19th century Mink * Long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata) — Like the ermine, fairly common in woods and thickets and near stone walls; especially near rivers and streams * Ermine or short-tailed weasel (Mustela erminea) — Like the long-tailed weasel, fairly common in woods and thickets and near stone walls; especially near rivers and streams * American marten (Martes americana) — one recent (as of 2004) road-kill in New Hartford, Connecticut (in the north-central to northwest part of the state) was the first certain evidence that the species occurs in Connecticut * Fisher (Pekania pennanti) — Fishers live in large, thickly wooded forests; the species was extirpated from southern New England when forests were cleared and was absent for more than a century. From 1989 to 1991, they were reintroduced from New Hampshire and by 2004 were established in northern Connecticut. Population density is normally no more than one fisher per several hundred acres. Skunks (Order Carnivora, Family Mephitidae) * Striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) — common in the state and in various habitats Cats (Order Carnivora, Family Felidae) Bobcat * Bobcat (Lynx rufus) — They favor thickets and patchy woods in the least-developed areas of the state, especially in the northwest highlands of Connecticut; they normally are scarce where coyotes are more prevalent. It is unknown whether or not the burgeoning coyote population has resulted in a decline in bobcats, however. Unlike coyotes, bobcats do not adapt well to nearby human populations; they prefer immature forests with a thick understory. In the 1970s the price of bobcat pelts rose so much that state officials became concerned they would be overharvested and reclassified the bobcat as a protected furbearer, with no hunting or trapping seasons.

Other factors are the mixture of young and mature forests, milder winters, and fewer predators. Deer were nearly eliminated from the state by the end of the 19th century, with fewer than 20 in all of Connecticut, although they were on the rebound by that point, in part due to state regulations to protect them. In 1907 the state allowed landowners to shoot deer causing crop damage. In 1974, the state passed its first deer management act and regular, licensed deer hunting began the next year.[ ]Web page titled \\"White-tailed Deer\\" at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 By the 1970s, the total state population was about 20,000, and up to 76,000 (a low estimate) in 2000. Fairfield County has the highest deer density in the state. According to one estimate, the county has 59 per square mile, more than double the density in the rest of the state, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. But another estimate, based on a survey in the winter of 2006–2007 estimated only 29.4 deer per square mile in the county.Cassidy, Martin B., \\"Bow-hunting group calls for new deer census in Greenwich\\", The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, September 6, 2007, Stamford edition, page A5 Deer can carry up to 1,000 ticks, many of which have Lyme disease. The state allows bowhunting for deers from September 15 to January 31. (According to an estimate in Connecticut Wildlife, published in 2004, \\"Winter density ranges up to about 40 per square mile in southwestern Connecticut, with a statewide mean of 21 per square mile.\\") Connecticut has several problems associated with its large deer population: * Motor vehicle accidents: State Farm insurance estimates that more than 10,000 deer in Connecticut are hit by cars each year.Schweber, Nate, \\"Car Hits Deer. Then What? It's High Season for Roadkill, and Disposal Costs Mount\\", article, The New York Times, Connecticut and the Region section, October 21, 2007, page 3 But the state Department of Environmental Protection estimates only 3,000 deer-motor vehicle accidents occur annually.Lee, Natasha, \\"Controlled hunt set for nature preserves: Group aims to cull deer population\\", The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, October 19, 2007, Norwalk edition, pp 1, A6 State policy is to bury deer carcases by the side of the road where they were hit. * Lyme disease: Culling the deer population in Groton, Connecticut, by about 90 percent reduced the incidence of new Lyme disease cases in town from about twenty a year to two or three a year.Stelloh, Tim, \\"Officials target deer in hunting proposal: New Canaan council hopes reduction will curb Lyme disease\\", article, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, August 19, 2007, page A3 * Habitat damage: In Greenwich, Connecticut, the Greenwich Audubon Society's of land have seen deer push out ground birds such as the ovenbird and black and white warbler. The deer have devastated species of plants once abundant on the Audubon group's land and ravaged low-lying vegetation, including hickory and hemlock saplings. Some once-abundant species in the area were completely absent as of late 2007, according to an Audubon official. Moose Moose Moose (Alces alces) — have become more prevalent in Connecticut in recent years, with the first documented reproduction (a female and two calves) found in 2000, and an estimated 100 in the state as of 2007. As of 2015, they come from Massachusetts whose population is rising dramatically over 1000, the population could be over 200 Web page titled \\"Moose\\" at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Web site, retrieved December 30, 2007 Most of these moose now live in northern Litchfield County, especially the towns of Hartland, Colebrook and Granby. They can occasionally be found throughout northern Litchfield and northwestern Hartford Counties and are known to wander throughout the state. When forests were largely replaced by farmland in the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, populations of moose (along with animals such as turkeys, black bears and mountain lions) lost their habitats and were greatly reduced or eliminated from the state. But even before Connecticut was settled by Europeans, the moose population was never large, according to the DEP. Moose are thought to be entering the state from the north (but have roamed as far south as Stamford and Fairfield, communities on Long Island Sound). In Massachusetts, three or four moose are hit by trains each year and about 15 motor vehicle collisions with the animals occur, although in some years there have been as many as 50. One Massachusetts environmental official estimated there were about 1000 moose in Massachusetts. The greatest danger to people from moose is car collisions. From 1995 to 2006, there was an average of one collision a year of a moose and an automobile across the state, although in the first half of 2007, there were four, including one in June on the Merritt Parkway in Stamford. Unlike deer, moose that feel threatened tend to stand their ground. Local police are authorized to kill the animals if they pose a threat to public safety, which in practice almost only means that the animal is getting too close to a highway.Stelloh, Tim, \\"DEP forecasts more moose-car collisions: Official expects animal population to increase across the state\\", The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, October 14, 2007, pp 1, A6 In 2007, police killed bull moose in separate incidents in Waterbury and Fairfield when each moose came close to a highway. In cases where no threat to the public seems imminent, DEP officials will usually try to tranquilize the animal or harass them into a nearby woods (sometimes by banging on pots or forming a line to try to scare the animal away). In 2008, state authorities knocked out a year-old female moose in New Britain with a tranquilizer dart and released it on state forest land in northern Connecticut. Moose are generally reclusive, but male moose tend to wander about in the fall, during their mating season, and year-old moose tend to wander when their mothers get ready to give birth to new calves, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection.No byline, \\"Wandering Moose Tranquilized In New Britain\\", Hartford Courant, May 21, 2009, retrieved May 23, 2009 The 2008 New Britain moose, for example, was thought by officials to be the same animal seen in Avon and Farmington the week before.

California, 539 U.S. 607 (2003), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which held that California's retroactive extension of the statute of limitations for sexual offenses committed against minors was an unconstitutional ex post facto law. Background In 1994, the California State Legislature enacted a specific statute of limitations (PC Section 803(g) (3)(A)) for child sexual abuse crimes, allowing charges to be filed within one year of the time that the crime was reported to the police. It allowed, when the prior limitations period has expired, criminal prosecution on child molesting charges many years after its occurrence. In 1998, petitioner Marion Stogner was indicted for molesting for acts committed between 1955 and 1973, under California's specific statute of limitations. It occurred after Stogner's two sons were both charged with molestation. During the state's investigation of one of the sons, Stogner's daughters reported that their father sexually abused them for years when they were under the age of 14. The grand jury found probable cause to charge Stogner with molestation of his two daughters. . Stogner claimed that the statute violates the ex post facto law and due process clauses by retroactively invoking laws that were not in place at the time of the alleged offenses. At the time that the crimes were allegedly committed, the statute of limitations was three years. The victims, his two daughters, said that they had not reported sooner because they were in fear of their father. The applicable California law had been revised in 1996, extending the statute of limitations retroactively. Appeals The retroactive implementation of the laws was the focus of Stogner's appeal, claiming that the law violated his rights under the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution, as well as his rights to due process. The trial court denied Stogner's subsequent motion for dismissal under the same grounds. Stogner appealed on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California, first appellate district; the Court of Appeal affirmed. Stogner ultimately appealed to the US Supreme Court. Decision The Supreme Court upheld the trial court's ruling that the law was a violation of the ex post facto clause of the constitution by a split 5-4 decision. The Supreme Court held that \\"a law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 539 *List of United States Supreme Court cases Footnotes External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:Legal history of California Category:2003 in United States case law Category:2003 in California ","title":"Stogner v.

It is also referred to as Philippine ceviche due to its similarity to the Latin American dish Ceviche.The Appetizer Atlas: A World of Small Bites, p. 189 It is more accurately a cooking process that relies on vinegar and/or acidic fruit juices (usually citrus) to denature the ingredients, rather than a dish, as it can also be used to prepare meat and vegetables. Kilawin is a meat-based preparation method quite similar but not the same as kinilaw. It is more common in the northern Philippines and use blanched and lightly grilled meat (not raw). Kinilaw dishes are usually eaten as appetizers before a meal, or as finger food () with alcoholic drinks. Description The most common kinilaw dish is kinilaw na isda (\\"fish kinilaw\\") prepared using raw cubed fish mixed with vinegar (usually coconut vinegar or cane vinegar) as the primary denaturing agent; along with a souring agent to enhance the tartness like calamansi, dayap, biasong, kamias, tamarind, green mangoes, balimbing, and green sineguelas. It is flavored with salt and spices like black pepper, ginger, onions, and chili peppers (commonly siling labuyo or bird's eye chili). An average serving of fish kinilaw contains just 147 calories. To neutralize the fishy taste and the acidity before serving, juice extracts from the grated flesh of tabon-tabon fruits (Atuna racemosa), dungon fruits (Heritiera sylvatica and Heritiera littoralis), or immature small young coconuts are also commonly added. Extracts from the bark scrapings of sineguelas or bakawan trees (Rhizophora mangroves) are also used similarly. Some regional variants also add gatâ (coconut milk), sugar, or even soft drinks to reduce the sourness. Popular kinds of fish used in kinilaw include tanigue or tangigue (Spanish mackerels, king mackerel, or wahoo), malasugi (marlins or swordfish), tambakol (yellowfin tuna), bangus (milkfish), shark and anchovies. =Kilawin= Variants predominantly from the northern Philippines use meat (usually called kilawin to distinguish them from other kinilaw), including goat meat, beef, carabao, pork, and chicken. Unlike fish kinilaw, meat kilawin are not eaten raw but are cooked by boiling or grilling or both. They are usually done rare to medium rare, though in some cases the meat are fully cooked. Meat-based kilawin are also traditionally eaten with papaít (literally \\"bittering agent\\"), usually the bile extracted from the gall bladder or by squishing the chewed grass in an animal's stomach. Seafood used in kinilaw must be fresh and properly cleaned, as there are health hazards involved with consuming raw seafood; in kilawin the partly cooked meat has to be fresh and properly cleaned as well. =Other seafood= Other ingredients that can be used to make kinilaw include shrimp, squid, clams, oysters, crabs, sea urchin roe, seaweed, jellyfish, shipworms (tamilok) or even beetle larvae (grubs), among others. They vary in terms of preparation, depending on the ingredients, from raw to fully cooked. For example, shrimp are prepared raw, while squid needs to be blanched first to tenderize the flesh. =Salads= Kinilaw also refers to dishes using raw fruits and vegetables marinated in vinegar and spices, in which case the dishes are sometimes referred to by the Spanish term ensalada (\\"salad\\"). Examples include cucumbers (pipino), bitter melons (ampalaya), young sweet potato (camote) leaves, young papaya, vegetable ferns (pako), and banana flowers. History Kinilaw is native to the Philippines. The Balangay archaeological excavation site in Butuan (dated c. 10th to 13th century AD) has uncovered remains of halved tabon-tabon fruits and fish bones cut in a manner suggesting that they were cubed, thus indicating that the cooking process is at least a thousand years old. It was also described by Spanish colonists and explorers to the Philippines, with the earliest mention being in the Vocabulario de la lengua tagala (1613) as cqinicqilao and cquilao, a Hispanicized spelling of the Visayan verb kilaw (\\"to eat raw\\"), and a cognate of the adjective hilaw (\\"raw\\", \\"uncooked\\", or \\"unripe\\"). Other sources that mention it include the Vocabulario de la lengua Pampanga en romance (1732) as quilao; and in the 1754 edition of Vocabulario de la lengua tagala as quilauin. Unlike Latin American ceviches, which exclusively use citrus juices (which are not native to the Americas), kinilaw instead primarily uses vinegar in addition to citrus (native to tropical Asia), and other acidic fruit juices.  Regional names and variants Some of the oldest surviving kinilaw variants are from the southern Visayas and Northern Mindanao, like Cagayan de Oro's kinilaw (sometimes stylized as kinilaw de Oro) and Dumaguete's binakhaw. Both are direct descendants of ancient Visayan preparation methods as displayed in the Butuan archeological finds. These are the original versions that use tabon-tabon and dungon fruits respectively. Several regions of the Philippines have local specialties or names of kinilaw dishes. In the northern Philippines, the Ivatan people of the Batanes islands refer to kinilaw as lataven. Ivatan fish kinilaw is known as lataven a among (also spelled lataven a amung). In Ilocos, the Ilocano kilawin kalding or kilawen specifically refers to lightly grilled goat meat kinilaw. Among the Kapampangan people of Pampanga, quilain (also spelled kilayen or kilayin) or quilain babi refers to kinilaw that use fully cooked pork, heart, liver, and tripe. A similar dish among the Caviteño Tagalogs uses fully boiled pork ears, and is known as kulao or kilawin na tainga ng baboy. When mixed with fried tokwa (tofu) cubes, kulao becomes the more familiar dish tokwa't baboy. Modern variants of this dish use soy sauce in addition to the other ingredients. In the southern Philippines, the Tausug people of the Sulu islands refer to fish kinilaw as lawal. Unlike other kinilaw dishes, lawal only uses vinegar to wash the fish, and primarily relies on citrus fruits and other souring agents to denature the fish meat. Among the Maranao people of southwestern Mindanao, biyaring is a type of kinilaw made with tiny shrimp. It is a regional favorite and is notable because it is ideally prepared while the shrimp are still alive.

It is based on the 1975 novel of the same name by Mary Higgins Clark. Plot On her birthday, San Francisco resident Nancy Harmon's two kids Peter and Lisa disappear, later to be found dead. The police wrongly accuse a devastated Nancy of being the killer. Nancy is found guilty and sentenced to the gas chamber, but her attorney manages to get her conviction overturned. Much to the District Attorney's dismay, Nancy can't be put back on trial because key witness Rob Legler has left the country. And Nancy's husband, college professor Carl Holder, commits suicide. Seven years later, Nancy has relocated to a town in Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Nancy has changed her identity, re-colored her hair, and has married a realtor named Ray Eldridge, with whom she has two kids named Michael and Missy, and the terrible pain from what happened to Peter and Lisa has begun to heal. But today is Nancy's birthday. She has allowed Michael and Missy to go out to play in the back yard. Nancy opens the newspaper and is stunned to find, in the local section of the paper, her picture and all of the details of the murders of Peter and Lisa. Nancy rushes out to the back yard to get Michael and Missy and bring them back into the house, but Nancy finds only one of Missy's red mittens...and Nancy knows that the nightmare is beginning again. Because of the disappearance and murder of Peter and Lisa, Nancy is understandably concerned about finding Mike and Missy before they are hurt the way Peter and Lisa were. Local police chief Jed Coffin, who has read the newspaper, wrongfully sees Nancy as a suspect in the disappearance of Michael and Missy. When people in the town read about Nancy in the newspaper, virtually everyone suspects her of murdering Mike and Missy. But Mike and Missy have been kidnapped by a man named Courtney Parrish. In the desperate search for Mike and Missy, everyone will discover the devastating truth as to who Courtney Parrish really is. And there is also another question—was it Parrish who killed Peter and Lisa years ago?

He is best known from the folktale of \\"Fiddler Foley\\", which is either not correct or does not apply to him. Richard was the son of another Richard Foley, a nailer at Dudley. Richard himself is likely to have traded in nails rather than making them. Ironmaster In the 1620s, he became a partner in a network of ironworks in south Staffordshire, which were undoubtedly the source of the family's fortune. The Folktale According to the folktale, he went to Sweden where, posing as a simple fiddler, he succeeded in discovering the secret of the slitting mill, which was enabling the price of English nails to be undercut. He returned home and set up a slitting mill at Hyde Mill in Kinver, thus making his fortune. Unfortunately, the earliest version of the legend, while applying to Hyde Mill, referred not to Richard Foley, but to a member of the Brindley family, who owned the mill until the 1730s. This may possibly have been George Brindley, Richard's brother-in-law. Richard certainly leased Hyde Mill in 1627 and converted it to a slitting mill, though it was not the first in England or even in the Midlands. Family Richard Foley married twice, and was able to set up several of his sons as gentlemen or in other prominent positions. By his first marriage: *Richard Foley (1614–1678) of Birmingham, and then an ironmaster at Longton in north Staffordshire. By his second marriage to Alice Brindley, daughter of Sir William Brindley of Willenhal: *Thomas Foley (1616-1677), another prominent ironmaster, whose descendant was elevated to the peerage as Baron Foley.

It was initiated by Robin Elisabeth Cornwell, and is endorsed by Richard Dawkins, a prominent atheist.http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/887-the- amazing-meeting-8-2010-speakers-and-performers.html The campaign aims to create more openness about being an atheist by providing a means by which atheists can identify themselves to others by displaying the movement's scarlet letter A, a scarlet colored capital \\"A\\" in the Zapfino typeface, and an allusion to the scarlet letter A worn by Hester Prynne after being convicted of adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter.Religion Must Be Destroyed, Atheist Alliance Declares by Matt Purple It encourages those who wish to be part of the campaign to come out and re-appropriate, in a humorous way, the social stigma that in some places persists against atheism, by branding themselves with a scarlet letter. Campaign Robin Elisabeth Cornwell in 2012 Cornwell has stated that the gay rights movement was a source of inspiration for the campaign. The campaign, however, encourages one to \\"out\\" only oneself; it invites atheists to: * Reach out and talk to others about atheism and help spread a positive view of atheism * Speak out about their own beliefs and values without feeling intimidated, thus helping people realize that atheists don't fit stereotypes and are a very diverse group * Keep out, meaning to promote the idea that religion should be kept out of public schools and government, and that nobody's religious agenda should be allowed to intimidate * Stand out and become visible in their communities and become involved. An offshoot of Stand out is the Non-Believers Giving Aid campaign, which has raised money to help out in the aftermath of disaster. The A+ symbol used in the campaign refers to Atheists Standing out for their activism in social and humanitarian efforts. Artwork from T-shirt sleeve The campaign produces discreet attire that is centered on the scarlet \\"A\\", and the term \\"OUT\\" which is usually typographically isolated from the rest of the containing phrase. There is no overt mention of atheism other than the use of the symbols. The \\"A\\" is one of the most popular symbols for atheism in current usage. Nonetheless, American Christian organizations have begun to respond: the campaign has even been called \\"a wake-up call\\" for Christians. The campaign produced T-shirts, hoodies, bumper stickers, stickers, and lapel pins sold through Richard Dawkins's online store, with the proceeds going to the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. Openly Secular In 2014, reflecting an approach similar to the \\"coming out\\" strategy of the gay rights movement, a group called Openly Secular was formed to encourage nonreligious and non-theistic Americans to be open about their personal secularity. The group states its mission \\"is to eliminate discrimination and increase acceptance by getting secular people – including atheists, freethinkers, agnostics, humanists and nonreligious people – to be open about their beliefs.\\" In one video produced for the group, comedian and television personality Bill Maher urges atheists to be open about their religious skepticism, dismissing the Bible as a book \\"based on ancient myths.\\" See also *Brights movement *Flying Spaghetti Monster *New Atheism *Secular movement References External links * Official website, archived 16 May 2015 * Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science * * Openly Secular Home Category:Atheism Category:Public awareness campaigns Category:Richard Dawkins Category:Atheism activism ","title":"Out Campaign"},{"id":"14954217","text":"Roger Decock (20 April 1927 – 30 May 2020) was a Belgian road bicycle racer who won the Paris–Nice in 1951 and the Tour of Flanders in 1952.Roger Decock, de oudste winnaar van de Ronde, is overleden Major results Sources ;1948 :1st Ronde van Vlaanderen Beloften :2nd Kattekoers ;1949 :2nd Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen ;1950 :1st Vijfbergenomloop :2nd Grand Prix Jules Lowie :4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne :9th Gent-Wevelgem :9th Paris-Brussels ;1951 :1st Overall Paris-Nice :1st Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen :1st Ronde van West- Vlaanderen :4th Gent-Wevelgem :9th Grand Prix des Nations ;1952 :1st Tour of Flanders :2nd Brussel-Ingooigem :2nd GP de Suisse :4th Overall Dwars door België :5th Vijfbergenomloop :6th Liège-Bastogne-Liège :7th La Flèche Wallonne ;1953 :1st Stage 11 Tour du Maroc :5th Roubaix–Huy :6th Paris-Roubaix :6th GP de Suisse :9th Gent-Wevelgem :9th Overall Paris-Nice ;1954 :Tour of Belgium ::1st Stages 3, 4a (ITT) & 5 :1st Scheldeprijs :2nd Road race, National Road Championships :2nd Brussel-Ingooigem :2nd Roubaix–Huy :2nd Grand Prix Jules Lowie :2nd Circuit des XI Villes :7th Liège-Bastogne-Liège :7th Paris-Tours :8th La Flèche Wallonne :8th Paris-Brussels :9th Tour of Flanders :10th Paris- Roubaix ;1955 :1st Brussel-Ingooigem :4th Paris-Brussels :6th Ronde van Brabant :7th Tour of Flanders ;1956 :4th Omloop Het Volk :6th Giro di Lombardia :6th Tre Valli Varesine :8th Nationale Sluitingsprijs ;1957 :1st Nationale Sluitingsprijs :1st Stage 1 Ronde van Nederland :9th Paris-Brussels ;1958 :10th Milan-San Remo ;1959 :1st Omloop van Oost-Vlaanderen :7th GP Flandria ;1960 :5th Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen References External links * * Category:1927 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Izegem Category:Belgian male cyclists Category:Sportspeople from West Flanders Category:Tour de France cyclists ","title":"Roger Decock"},{"id":"14954258","text":"Cas-en-Bas is a settlement in Saint Lucia; it is located in the northern part of the island.

Originally known as Morne Dubuc, it was renamed Morne Fortuné in 1765 when the French moved their military headquarters and government administration buildings here from Vigie Height. A fort was constructed here by the French, Citadelle du Morne Fortuné, completed in 1784. The fort was first captured by the British on 1 April 1794, but recaptured by the French in June 1795. It was captured again by the British on 24 May 1796. A memorial to the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot still stands commemorating the battle. France regained possession in 1802 with the Treaty of Amiens, but Commodore Samuel Hood defeated French Governor Brig. Gen. Antoine Noguès in June 1803, and the fort remained a British one until independence in 1979. Fort Charlotte was named on 4 April 1794 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn to honor Queen Charlotte. The 1st West India Regiment manned Apostle's Battery on 16 December 1888 when the port became a coaling station. On 12 November 1890, the Royal Artillery manned four RML 10 inch 18 ton guns. The fort was abandoned in 1905; a Secondary School occupies the site. The original fortifications also still stand on the summit, and the old military buildings are in a listed historical area. The Saint Lucia National Trust operates this area. Morne Fortune also hosts the Saint Lucian campus of the University of the West Indies as well as Sir Arthur Lewis Community College.

Miller was elected as MP for Maldon in the 1852 general election. However an election petition and an investigation into corrupt practices in the borough (in which he was not implicated) led to the election being declared void on 18 March 1853; the writ was suspended and the by-election was not held until August 1854. In February 1857 he stood unsuccessfully at a by- election in Colchester, but won the seat at the general election in March 1857 and held it until his resignation on 5 February 1867 by taking the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead. He married Marian Cheyne in 1838 and was a Church Warden of St Johns Westminster in 1855. In 1831 he appeared as primary prosecution witness at the trial of a 19-year-old George Fox at the Old Bailey where Fox was convicted for pickpocketing Miller's silk handkerchief and was sentenced to be transported for fourteen years.

Mine A sulphur mine was operated by Bennett and Wood from 1836 until 1840. Maximum production occurred in 1836, with 540 tons of sulphur exported. Springs The creation of the sulfur springs, came from a weak spot in the crust of the enormous collapsed crater creating an upheaval of lava 410,000 years ago. The water located at the center of the springs boils at roughly 340 Fahrenheit (170 Celsius) creating large plumes of steam. The water coming out of the spring is blackened by a chemical reaction between the high content of sulfur and iron. The spring water also contains large deposits of copper, iron oxide, alkaline lead, calcium oxide, and carbon.

Gros Islet is one of the ten quarters in the island. It can be found on the northwestern coast of the island above the Castries quarter, where the capital of St. Lucia is, and the Dauphin quarter. St. Lucia is a small island in North America located in the Caribbean Sea and it is the largest of the Caribbean's Windward Islands. The Windward islands include Martinique, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada. It is in a chain of islands in the Lesser Antilles with Martinique to the north and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the south.These islands are southeast of the islands of Puerto Rico and Haiti. Out of the two airports in St.Lucia, Hewanorra and Charles airport, Rodney Bay is closer to the latter.  Geography  Rodney Bay is horseshoe shaped with a man made lagoon. Reduit Beach is the most popular beach on the island, which tourists love for its cleanliness, length, white sands, and clear water. It also features the Splash Island Water Park with obstacle courses on the water.The bay also includes a Marina that is now the second largest yachting center in the Caribbean sea, under the Yacht Haven Grande in Saint Thomas. The Marina was constructed in 1985 then bought by IGY Marinas in 2007. The Marina has 221 anchorages and 32 mega yacht docks for holding. There is an annual Atlantic Rally for Cruisers in December that attracts around 270 boats and 1200 people. In terms of weather, temperatures are high year round, but the coolest month is in January while the hottest month is in August. It rains mostly in the months of May to December. December is the wettest, while April is the driest month. Reduit Beach  History  The Bay was named after Admiral George Brydges Rodney who formed his fort at Pigeon Island. Pigeon island is a national landmark in St.Lucia, declared in 1992 by the St. Lucian government. It's 44 acres and was originally surrounded by water until 1972 when it was artificially joined to the mainland. The island was originally inhabited by the Arawak people who then signed a peace treaty with the French leader Francois Le Clerc. England declared war on France in 1778 and attacked them in St. Lucia and invaded the island. Once they arrived however, Admiral Rodney expelled all the Arawak people and cut down all of the trees on Pigeon island so that he could spy on the French naval base in Martinique. In doing so, he was able to defeat them at the Battle of Saints in 1782. Pigeon Island is now open as a national park 365 days a year to visitors. The landmark still has an 18th-century theme to it while still keeping its natural beauty with its dry rain forests and grasslands. Visitors can learn more about Francois Le Clerc who had an actual wooden leg and they can learn how Pigeon Island was connected to the mainland in 1972. Tourists can also explore the military ruins from Fort Rodney. Admiral Rodney Pigeon Island National Park  Tourism  Rodney Bay is a popular town for tourists- known as St.Lucia’s entertainment and recreation center. It consists of dozens of hotels and rentals to choose from along with the island's two largest shopping malls and the Treasure Bay Casino.

Its owner is Ocean Capital Investments, New Brunswick Limited. The focus is providing local radio for the communities it serves, live-to-air streaming on the internet, and podcasts. Acadia Broadcasting operates four radio stations in New Brunswick and four in Nova Scotia under the Acadia Broadcasting name. In 2007, Acadia Broadcasting acquired Fawcett Broadcasting with its three northwestern Ontario radio stations. In January 2010, Acadia acquired two more radio stations in Thunder Bay, Ontario. In March 2014, Acadia acquired a radio station in Moncton, New Brunswick. In April 2016, Acadia acquired a radio station in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. In 2019, Acadia acquired a radio station in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia. History In 1928, CFBO was launched by C.A. Monro Limited. Mr. Monro had obtained a private commercial broadcasting license from the Department of Marine and Fisheries of the Dominion of Canada in Ottawa, dated April 1, 1928, for the purpose of setting up and operating an AM radio station of only 50 watts in Saint John, New Brunswick. This was radio license No. 23 issued in Canada. In 1934, four newspaper publishing shareholders in Saint John, New Brunswick- Howard P. Robinson, J.D. McKenna, T.F. Drummie, and L.W. Bewick - purchased the station CFBO from C.A. Monro. Overnight, the station's new callsign became CHSJ, and it broadcast out of a new modern studio with new experienced management. Operated by Saint John Publishing Co. Limited, CHSJ soon became an affiliate of CBC Radio's Trans-Canada Network, an important link in the development of the national network. In 1944, Kenneth C. Irving purchased Saint John Publishing Company Limited from its principal shareholder, Howard P. Robinson. With this purchase, Irving acquired both the radio station CHSJ and the two local newspapers. Later that year, the company name was changed to New Brunswick Publishing Company Limited and its subsidiary New Brunswick Broadcasting was responsible for CHSJ radio. In 1989, New Brunswick Broadcasting purchased Acadia Broadcasting, CKBW in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia from the retiring shareholders. The new ownership kept the station name, Acadia Broadcasting. In 2001, New Brunswick Broadcasting launched two new radio stations in New Brunswick, CHWV-FM in Saint John, New Brunswick and CHTD-FM in St. Stephen, Mew Brunswick. In 2003, the names New Brunswick Broadcasting and Acadia Broadcasting were replaced by a single new name, Acadia Broadcasting. In May 2007, Acadia Broadcasting Limited acquired three radio stations in northern Ontario: CKDR-FM in Dryden, CJRL-FM in Kenora, and CFOB-FM in Fort Frances.

History XEA-AM was Campeche's first radio station and the only station in the state for 18 years. Its roots lay in an unlicensed station that operated for a time in 1938 but was shut down a month later because it lacked a concession. Given the public interest that the new station had excited, Luis A. Maury applied for a concession, and on August 7, 1939, XEA-AM on 1370 kilohertz took to the air with the final annual address of Governor Eduardo Mena Córdova. Its formal concession was issued eight days later. XEA initially operated three hours a day, in the evening, and as electricity was scarce in Campeche, few residents had radios. It was commonly known as \\"El Eco de las Murallas\\". Alejandro Casanova Brito, known as \\"Lexo\\", joined the station as an early announcer. By 1942, Maury wanted out of the radio business and sold the station to Casanova, who obtained financing for the acquisition from Governor Héctor Pérez Martínez. Casanova repaid the governor with airtime, leading to the creation of La Hora Estatal, a government radio program similar to the modern opt-outs of La Hora Nacional. Sponsored programming arrived on the station, as did a restructuring of the broadcast day. Newscasts like \\"Vida Social Arceo\\" and \\"Cuestión de Minuto\\", modest radio novels, live remotes from popular dances and political gatherings, and the transmission of Piratas de Campeche baseball games in the Peninsular League were staples of XEA. Additionally, the provision of round-the-clock electricity to Campeche beginning in 1950 increased the popularity of local radio. The station produced a variety of locally recognized announcers and hosts. It would not be until 1957 that the station had competition, as Manuel Araujo Echeverría set up Campeche's second station on 1430 kHz, XEUK-AM. Six years later, the station was sold to the Rivas-Arceo Corcuera consortium of Yucatán broadcaster Rafael Rivas Franco and local Alberto Arceo Corcuera, who rebranded it XERAC- AM. Additionally, XECAM-AM was built in 1961 by Rafael Cutberto Navarro. In the late 1960s, now with local competition, XEA moved to a musical format and took the name Radio Variedades, with a wide variety of music in Spanish. In 1980, Arceo Corcuera bought XEA, making it sister station to XERAC as well as XHMI-FM, the first FM station in the state. He quickly built a media empire, which also featured stations in Palizada, Escárcega and Champotón and the Tribuna newspaper. This became known as Núcleo Comunicación del Sureste. With the sale, XEA changed its format to tropical music. In 1985, XEA along with the Palizada and Escárcega stations secured an affiliation to Radiorama. In 2008, XEA picked up the Ke Buena national grupera format. The station migrated to 102.7 MHz FM in 2011 and changed its callsign to XHAC-FM, making it one of two unrelated stations to bear the callsign along with a station in Aguascalientes.

Frankie Bennett, a mischievous boy, tells them new bikes can be had at a local dairy in exchange for 1,000 bottle caps from the company's products. The boys collect the bottle caps, but, in attempting to redeem them, learn they've been duped. Ward takes pity on the boys and buys them a bicycle.  Characters and cast  * June Cleaver (Barbara Billingsley) is the wife of Ward Cleaver and the mother of Wally and Beaver. * Ward Cleaver (Casey Adams) is the husband of June Cleaver and the father of Wally and Beaver. * Wally Cleaver (Paul Sullivan) is the older son of Ward and June and the brother of Beaver. * Theodore \\"Beaver\\" Cleaver (Jerry Mathers) is the younger son of Ward and June and the brother of Wally. * Miss Simms (Diane Brewster) is a secretary/receptionist at the Franklin Milk Company. * Mr. Baxter (Richard Deacon) is an executive at the Franklin Milk Company and Miss Simms' boss. * Mr. Crowley (Joseph Kearns) is the CEO of the Franklin Milk Company. * Frankie Bennett (Harry Shearer) is a mischievous boy and an acquaintance of Wally and Beaver.  Production  \\"It's a Small World\\" was filmed with a single camera, in full screen black-and-white at Republic Studios and the Universal Studios backlot. With some modifications, the façade of the Cleaver house in the pilot became that of the Cleaver house in the first two seasons of the series. Some decorative elements (like the curtains in the boys' bedroom) would be retained for the series. Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher wrote the teleplay with Jerry Hopper directing the episode. Richard Lewis produced the episode. A number of actors who appeared in supporting roles in the pilot were later cast in recurring roles in the series. Diane Brewster appears as Miss Simms, a secretary, with Richard Deacon as Mr. Baxter, Miss Simms' boss. Brewster and Deacon would find roles in the series as Miss Canfield, Beaver's second grade teacher, and Fred Rutherford, Ward's co-worker and father of \\"Lumpy,\\" Eddie Haskell's easily duped henchman/bully. Other cast members include Russ Thorson as Man with Milk Bottles, Leonard Bremen as Milk Bar Operator, Tim Graham as Doc, and Virginia Carroll as Nurse. After the series was picked up by CBS, Hugh Beaumont replaced Casey Adams as Ward Cleaver while the role of Wally went to Tony Dow after Sullivan experienced a growth spurt before the series' production.Mathers, Jerry. ...And Jerry Mathers as \\"The Beaver\\".

In October 2014, the council voted to change the commune's name to \\"Templeuve-en-Pévèle\\". The name change took effect 16 November 2015.Décret n° 2015-1487 16 November 2015 Heraldry Windmill Windmill of Vertain Templeuve-en-Pévèle is the location of a windmill. The windmill tower is first mentioned in 1328 in rent documents of Anchin Abbey, as the \\"Moulin de Viertain\\". It was burned during the war in 1616, and completely rebuilt. It stopped productive work in 1908, and was damaged during the First World War by people wanting wood. Its restoration began in 1980 and the sails were added in 1985. It is now open to visits. It was successful in the hands of the families De la Porte dit d'Espierres, Robert, Jacops d'Aigrement before the French Revolution. It was then owned by the Havet and Band families. The mill, whose tower was erected at the end of the seventeenth century, remained active until the death of miller Jean-Baptiste Houze on 21 November 1907. His widow completed grinding the last bags of grain and then abandoned the mill. Jean Bruggeman, the president of the Regional Association 'des Amis des Moulins', inspired the municipality of Templeuve-en-Pévèle to acquire the mill in 1973. The restoration was completed on 15 June 1985, and it was opened by the mayor, Robert Vandelanoitte, and Alphonse Dhelin, the Assistant for Cultural Affairs.

The song originally featured on their eponymous debut album, but a re-recorded version provided OMD with their first Top 40 hit single in the UK, reaching number 13. As with debut single \\"Electricity\\", \\"Messages\\" features a melodic synth break instead of sung chorus. Most copies of the original 10\\" pressing with the album version were scrapped on behalf of the band (because they wanted to rerecord the song), but a handful did escape destruction. Some of these were given away as part of a competition for the OMD fan club in 1980. These pressings can be distinguished only by the shorter track time and different runout information. The later grey two-tone labels incorrectly state the producer as Chester Valentino. Mike Howlett is the producer, as the track was remixed and times at 4:48 – later editions again feature grey labels correctly attributed to Howlett and were also issued with different coloured record labels including red, green and a pink/white combination. These labels also correctly credit Howlett for the production. The song was featured in the second series of Ashes to Ashes (2009). It has been covered by White Town and Ganymede.Messages: Modern Synthpop Artists Cover OMD. AllMusic. Retrieved 14 November 2016. Reception AllMusic writer Dave Thompson called the song \\"haunting\\" and \\"sublime\\", with a \\"gorgeous melody [that] is swallowed in sorrow\\". Colleague Ned Raggett wrote that the track \\"wears the emotion of its lyrics on its sleeve, with a killer opening line – 'It worries me, this kind of thing, how you hope to live alone and occupy your waking hours' – and a melody both propulsive and fragile\\". Both found the re-recorded single version to be an improvement on the original. Song versions and B-sides An early version of \\"Messages\\" was recorded on 20 August 1979 and broadcast by John Peel on his Radio 1 programme on 3 September. Although the song structure and lyrics remained the same, the song originally had a slower tempo than either the single or album versions, the latter being the first to be officially released on the band's debut album in February 1980. The song was re-recorded for the release as a single in May 1980 and this new version differs from the album version. The single was produced by Mike Howlett who would go on to produce the band's highly successful follow up single \\"Enola Gay\\" and their second album Organisation later in the year. The 7\\" version is slightly shorter than the 10\\" with an earlier fade out. The 10\\" version is featured on the compilation albums The Best of OMD (1989), The OMD Singles (1998) and Messages: Greatest Hits (2008), which takes its title from this song and also includes the music video. The 10\\" version was also added as a bonus track on the remastered Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album, released in 2003. An instrumental dub version of \\"Messages\\", titled \\"Taking Sides Again\\" is featured as the B-side on both the 7\\" and 10\\" singles. On the 10\\" single, a cover version of The Velvet Underground's song \\"I'm Waiting for the Man\\" was included, retitled \\"Waiting for the Man\\". Both B-sides can be found as bonus tracks on the remastered Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark; only \\"Waiting for the Man\\" was included on the Navigation: The OMD B-Sides compilation album, released in 2001. Sleeve design There are different sleeves for the 7\\" and 10\\". Both were designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens. The photography was done by Trevor Key. TV promotion and chart performance The band performed the song live for a showcase appearance on the BBC music programme The Old Grey Whistle Test in May 1980. The performance was later featured in the Synth Britannia at the BBC programme following the Synth Britannia documentary first broadcast in October 2009. The group also made their Top of the Pops debut on 8 May 1980 when the single was at just no. 53 in the UK Singles Chart. Sheffield electronic music band The Human League also made their Top of the Pops debut on the same show. Although \\"Messages\\" made slow progress in the charts, the band made a second performance on the programme on 29 May when it was at no. 26 for the second week running. The single eventually made it to no. 13 but was not featured on Top of the Pops again due to the UK Musicians Union strike. Live performances The song has been regularly performed live by the band during concerts since 1979. Official audio releases can be found on Live at Leigh Rock Festival 1979 (released 2006), Access All Areas (1980 performance, CD/DVD released 2015), \\"Universal\\" CD single (1993 performance, released 1996), Dazzle Ships at The Museum of Liverpool (2014 performance, CD/DVD released 2015) and Architecture & Morality / Dazzle Ships – Live at the Royal Albert Hall (2016). Video releases of live performances of \\"Messages\\" can be found on the DVDs OMD Live: Architecture & Morality & More (2007) and Electricity: OMD with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (2009) as well as on the Access All Areas and Dazzle Ships at The Museum of Liverpool DVDs. The band performed their version of \\"Waiting For the Man\\" during live shows in 1979 and 1980, and later performed a radical reworking of the song featuring brass instruments on their Junk Culture tour in 1984.

The territory located on the banks of Rhine river roughly corresponded with the present-day state of Hesse and the adjacent Palatinate region in the south. History The Franconian stem duchy, part of former Frankish Austrasia, was seized by King Otto I of Germany after the unsuccessful revolt of the Conradine duke Eberhard had shattered at the 939 Battle of Andernach. With the advancement of Count Conrad the Red, Rhenish Franconia became the heartland of the Imperial Salian dynasty, which provided four emperors in the 11th and 12th centuries: Conrad II, Henry III, Henry IV, and Henry V. It contained the ancient cities of Mainz, Speyer and Worms, the latter two being the administrative centres of countships within the hands of the Salian descendants of Conrad the Red. These counts were sometimes referred to informally, on account of the great power in the region, as dukes of Franconia. Emperor Conrad II was actually the last to bear the ducal title. When he died in 1039, Rhenish Franconia was governed as a constellation of small states, like the cities of Frankfurt, Speyer and Worms, the Prince- bishoprics of Mainz, Speyer, and Worms, as well as the Landgraviate of Hesse, then part of Thuringia. Alongside these powerful entities there were many smaller, petty states. In 1093, Emperor Henry IV gave the Salian territories in Rhenish Franconia as a fief to Henry of Laach, the Count palatine of Lower Lorraine at Aachen, his lands then would evolve into the important principality of the Electoral Palatinate. While Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1198 granted the ducal title to the Prince-Bishops of Würzburg in Eastern Franconia, Rhenish Franconia was divided and extinguished. Its territories became part of the Imperial Upper Rhenish Circle in 1500. Successor states of Western Franconia The following are the most important of the states that had formed on the territory of Western (or Rhenish) Franconia by the 13th century: {  * Archbishopric of Mainz * Bishopric of Speyer * Abbacy of Hersfeld * Margraviate of Baden * County Palatine of the Rhine * County of Calw * Landgraviate of Hesse * County of Katzenelnbogen * County of Leiningen * County of Nassau * County of Nidda * County of Wetterau  * Raugraviate * Rhinegraviate * County of Solms * County of Sponheim * County of Veldenz * County of Waldeck * County of Weissenburg * County of Wied * Wild County * County of Wittgenstein * County of Ziegenhain * County of Zweibrücken  } Modern Franconia The eastern half of the historic duchy of Franconia on the Main river around the city of Würzburg and Nuremberg forms the modern Franconian region of northern Bavaria, the Würzburg bishops retained the title of a \\"Duke of Franconia\\".

Also from the album were the radio hits \\"An Den Ipirhes\\", \\"Savvatokiriako\\", \\"Fevgo Gia To 7\\", \\"I Kolasi Eimai Ego\\", and \\"Pali Tha Peis Signomi\\". 2005 also brought several collaborations for Chrispa. She sang with Giorgos Tsalikis and Constantinos Christoforou in the summer, while during the winter of 2005–2006 she went on the road with Elli Kokkinou, the Andreas Stamos, Constantinos Christoforou and Kalomoira. In 2006 and 2007, she released two more albums, Posa Hrostao and Kathreftis respectively. The first single from Kathreftis is \\"Mia Stigmi\\", which was made into a music video. =2008–present: From Eurovision to \\"Eisai asteri\\" and \\"Me skotonei\\"= She was a candidate in the Greek national final to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. Chrispa had chosen a song composed by Marios Psimopoulos with lyrics by Antonis Papas. The provisional title of the song was \\"SOS For Love\\", but later it was changed to \\"A Chance to Love\\". The song has an ethnic style, described as a \\"Dance Oriental\\",National Final, 27 February 2008, Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi (ERT). with lyrics in both Greek and English. At the national final, held on 27 February 2008, Chrispa performed \\"A Chance to Love\\" first out of the three participants. She placed third with 15.9% of the vote. Kostas Martakis placed second, and Kalomoira went to Eurovision with \\"Secret Combination\\", eventually placing third. On 6 October 2009, Chrispa released her fifth studio album, titled Mehri Edo. It included eleven new tracks composed by Stefanos Korkolis, with lyrics by Rebecca Roussi. It was reported that Chrispa had expressed dissatisfaction with her label's lack of promotion of the album, and as a result, considered prematurely exiting her contract with Minos EMI. Since that album, Chrispa has released four digital singles: \\"Den yposxomai tipota\\" (I can't make any promises) (2010), \\"Eisai asteri\\" (You're a star) (2011), \\"Kolla 5\\" (Hi5) (2012) and \\"Me skotonei\\" (It's killing me) (2013). TV appearances =Dancing With the Stars= Since October 2013, Chrispa has appeared as a contestant on the Greek Dancing with the stars. Though the judges appear to be very harsh on her, giving her low scores, she has managed to remain in the game as a result of the game's televoting. It is even mentioned on social media that her popularity has increased after the guest judge (Giorgos Liagkas) insulted her. =Other TV appearances= Chrispa has appeared in many Greek TV shows promoting her songs. In 2009 she guest starred on the Greek sitcom Polikatoikia.http://neoi-dimosiografoi.blogspot.gr/2009/03/blog- post_29.html She also appeared on the TV show Pame paketo, where she invited her music teacher Sofia Vossou to thank her publicly for believing in her and helping her to have a career.http://entertainment.in.gr/html/ent/885/ent.77885.asp Another notable appearance was on the Greek Big Brother, where she entered the house, as a part of a game, in order to harass the contestants.

Design Essentially a refined and enlarged version of the later \\"headless\\" Model D, variants of the Model E made important steps in pioneering the development of seaplanes and flying boats in America. Like its predecessor, the Model E was an open-framework biplane with two-bay unstaggered wings of equal span. In landplane configuration, it was fitted with tricycle undercarriage, and as a seaplane with a large central pontoon and outriggers under the wings. Most examples of the Model E followed the pattern of the \\"headless\\" Model Ds, with elevators and horizontal stabilizer carried together in the cruciform tail unit. The large ailerons were mounted in the interplane gap, their span continuing past the wings themselves, and as before were controlled by a shoulder yoke accommodating sideways \\"leaning\\" movements by the pilot to operate them. The Model E was designed and built as a two-seater, although in practice some of the lower- powered versions were converted to single-seaters. Black pontoons on the wingtips of A-1 slanted diagonally backward toward the water to reduce friction on water and serve to balance aircraft on water. On the bottom of each pontoon is a little hydroplane of wood measuring 3 inches wide by ¼ inch thick to further aid in balance and reduce friction. The front elevator on A-1 was at the aviators feet. Triad could skim the water at 50 mph and had an endurance of 150 miles. Glenn Curtiss demonstrated a capability to skim along the surface in two-foot seas. CAPT Washington Irving Chambers expressed confidence in landing in “moderate seas”, but stated he would not attempt to land in them and further added that they could adapt the movements of the Triad to conform to the seas. The increased weight and drag of the “amphibian” gear cost the Triad 5 knots of airspeed, so the more powerful 75 hp v8 was required to maintain the speed of the land plane configuration. Altitude was unaffected. Times-Picayune. Our Aero Amphibian Fleet. John Elfreth Watkins. August 20, 1911. Page 1. Operational history The Model E achieved fame through examples purchased by the United States Navy. A $4,400 Model E-8-75 floatplane became the Navy's first aircraft when ordered on 8 May 1911 and received the designation A-1, as well as the nickname \\"Triad\\" hydroaeroplane since it could operate from land and sea and in the air. Theodore Ellyson became the Navy's first pilot when he took off from Keuka Lake near Hammondsport, New York on 30 June. In all, the Navy was to purchase some 14 Model Es, designating their earliest examples from A-1 to A-4, then redesignating these together with new purchases in the AH-1 to AH-18 block of serials. These aircraft achieved a number of firsts for the Navy, including the first cross-country flight in a seaplane, a world seaplane altitude record of 900 ft (274 m) a much later national seaplane altitude record of 6,200 ft (1,890 m), and, significantly for later naval operations, the first catapult launch of a seaplane. The aircraft originally designated A-2 had an especially interesting career. Purchased by the Navy in landplane configuration on 13 July 1911, by August it was fitted with two long, cigar-shaped sheet metal cylinder pontoons beneath the bottom frame, about four feet from each aviator. A-2 was converted into a floatplane the following June. In this configuration it set a seaplane flight endurance record of 6 hours 10 minutes on 6 October 1912. Later that month, it was extensively rebuilt along the lines of the Curtiss Tadpole hull, thus becoming the Navy's first flying boat. Later still, retractable wheels were added to create an amphibian that became known as the OWL (standing for \\"Over Water and Land\\"). This machine was redesignated E-1 and then AX-1 by the Navy and was finally destroyed on 27 November 1915. In addition to their naval service, the type was operated by the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, which purchased two examples of the Model E-4 (Signal Corps numbers S.C. 6 and 8), built a third entirely from spare parts (S.C. 23), and later acquired one of the Navy's seaplanes (AH-8). Poor safety and reliability records of pusher aircraft led to all examples being grounded on February 24, 1914, although the AH-8 was flown briefly in 1928 following a refurbishment. An original Model E-8-75 is preserved at the EAA AirVenture Museum and flew as recently as 1984. A replica of the A-1 was started in 1956, and built by employees of Convair, Ryan and Rohr for the San Diego Air & Space Museum. It flew a number of times in 1984 before being retired for static display. Another replica was built by the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum and flown in 2004, notable for its use of Curtiss' original flight control system.

Due to its complexity of loading it had a relatively low rate of fire—one round every five minutes. Field tests showed various drawbacks of the entire design (the recoil was too strong for many components: it damaged drive sprockets, ripped the gear-box away from its mountings, etc.) and the sheer length rendered it incredibly difficult to transport. Its development continued until 1960, when the idea of such overpowered guns (along with the 2A3), was abandoned in favor of tactical ballistic missiles, such as the 2K6 Luna.

It is similar to other FHA loan. FHASecure was a refinancing option that gives homeowners with non-FHA adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), current or delinquent and regardless of reset status, the ability to refinance into a FHA-insured mortgage. With FHASecure, the lender will not automatically disqualify you because you are delinquent on your loan, and the lender may offer you a second mortgage to make up the difference between the value of your property and what you owe. Eligible So long as you are current on your mortgage and have sufficient income to make the mortgage payment, you are eligible for an FHASecure refinance. If you are delinquent, the default must have been due to the payment shock of an interest rate reset or, in the case of an Option ARM, the \\"recasting\\" of the mortgage to fully amortizing. By refinancing into a FHA-insured mortgage, you can expect to pay lower monthly mortgage payments. FHASecure can improve the quality of life for many communities by helping to reduce the number of mortgage defaults and bringing greater stability to local housing markets.

The company offer various services ranging from guitar lessons, to a guitar shop, competitions, and events. The company is a nonprofit organization that relies on donation, events, and advertising on its web site. History In 1973, Thomas Heck wrote the foundations articles of incorporation. He has been the editor of Soundboard, the foundation's magazine. The foundation publishes Soundboard Scholar, a peer-reviewed journal, and Prodigies, a magazine for children. In 1968, Heck was living in Vienna, Austria, and collecting rare sheet music for guitar, including first editions by Mauro Giuliani. In 1973, he wrote the Articles of Incorporation in Santa Barbara, California, to create a non-profit foundation to which he could give his archive of sheet music. He created the archive in 1977 in Milwaukee while teaching at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music. A catalog of the inventory was assembled and mailed to interested buyers, who could receive photocopies of sheet music on request. A second edition of catalog was published four years later. During the 1980s, while Heck taught at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, the archive grew to include more sheet music, periodicals, and other materials related to classical guitar. In the 1990s, Heck was too busy to oversee the archive, so he sought someone to catalog it correctly, which turned out to be the University of Akron. Some of the GFA Archive was entered online at Akron. Competition The foundation holds an International Convention and Competition. The International Concert Artist Competition gives the following prizes to the winner: a recording contract, publishing contract, cash, and an international tour. The first competition took was held in 1982. Twenty-three guitarists entered the contest, and these were reduced to four finalists. To become finalists, guitarists were required to play three pieces selected by the jurors. Michael Chapdelaine won the first contest, while Adam Holzman won in 1983. Holzman's repertoire included the Fourth Lute Suite by J. S. Bach and Sevilla by Albeniz.

Covering over , it is the largest protected area in the country. The reserve is part of the Trans-Frontier Conservation Area and links to the Tanzanian Lukwika-Lumesule Game Reserve. It will connect to the Lake Niassa Reserve when it is completed. History Founded in 1954 while Mozambique was still Portuguese East Africa, Niassa did not receive effective protection until the end of the Mozambican Civil War with the signing of the Rome General Peace Accords. Since then, the Mozambican government has set up management systems in order to protect the ecology of northern Mozambique. The relative isolation and lack of development that protects the park also hurts its potential for tourism. Mozambican officials admit constraints to development of the park's appeal include \\"remoteness and difficult access ... lack of any established tourism infrastructure and the logistical hardship associated with starting an enterprise under these conditions.\\" Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion Panthera leo in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa. Borders The northern border is formed by the Rovuma River, which also forms the border with Tanzania. Niassa Reserve is twice the size of Kruger National Park and comparable to the total area of Wales, Denmark or Massachusetts. Ecosystem Niassa is part of the Eastern miombo woodlands, which also encompasses parts of Tanzania and Malawi. The reserve is one of the largest miombo woodland preserves in the world, with miombo forest covering half of the preserve. The remainder is mostly open savannah, with some wetlands and isolated patches of forest. 95% of the preserve's biomass is vegetation, which includes 21 types of plant matter and 191 species of trees and shrubs. Niassa Preserve boasts an African wild dog population of over 350, significant for an endangered mammal with a global population estimated at 8000. The park boasts a sable antelope population of over 12000, an elephant population of 16000, over 400 bird species, and large populations of Cape buffalo, impala, wildebeest, zebra and leopards.

Stranahan's was the first modern microdistillery to legally make whiskey in Colorado, and an early craft whiskey distiller in the United States. History Stranahan's was founded by Jess Graber and George Stranahan, after whom the whiskey is named, in Colorado in 2004.Jonathan Shikes, “Stranahan’s Colorado Whiskey has been sold to an East Coast liquid distributor,” Westword, December 28, 2010.Margaret Jackson, “Legend hangs a sale sign,” Denver Post, October 12, 2008. In 1998, Graber, a volunteer firefighter, met Stranahan, the founder and owner of Flying Dog Brewery, while fighting a fire at Stranahan's barn.Sean Kenyon, “Is Stranahan’s the punk rock of whiskey? Ask the bartender…” Westword, September 6, 2011.Natasha Gardner, “Strange Brew,” 5280, September 2011. They struck up a conversation about whiskey, and were soon in business together. One of the first craft whiskey distillers in the US,Geoff Kleinman, “Stranahan’s New American Whiskey,” Drink Spirits, January 25, 2011. Stranahan's is said to have \\"kicked off the Colorado distilling craze\\" with its whiskey and the designation it invented, Rocky Mountain Whiskey.Jeffries Blackerby, “Blithe Spirits,” New York Times Magazine, November 11, 2011. It was Colorado's first microdistillery,Jennings Brown, “The Colorado Spirit,” Cowboys & Indians, March 2010. and the state's first legal distillery since Prohibition.Josh Chinn, “Stranahan’s Colorado Whiskey Review,” Red White & Bourbon, March 27, 2013. The first batch of Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey was distilled in 2004 and bottled in 2006. Stranahan's was sold to New Jersey-based Proximo Spirits in 2010, with operations remaining in Colorado. By 2012, Proximo had increased whiskey production from around 12 barrels per week to 30, with plans to grow into the high forties. Stranahan's was sold in 38 states and 7 countries until 2010, when Proximo decided to scale down sales to mostly the Colorado area, maintaining the whiskey's availability in its home state.Stephen Wayne Kasica, “Stranahan’s Snowflake Whiskey,” Outside, December 18, 2013. Since 2011, Rob Dietrich has served as Stranahan's head distiller, after taking over from original head distiller Jake Norris. Product description =Distillation and aging= Stranahan's is a straight whiskey, aged in new charred oak barrels, like bourbon, with the final whiskey a blend of 2, 3 and 5 year-old whiskeys.“Malt Advocate Whisky Awards ‘Artisan Whiskey of the Year’: Stranahan’s Colorado Whiskey,” Whisky Advocate, February 2, 2010. It is distilled from a 100% malt barley base grain, with four barleys sourced from the Colorado area, and water sourced from the Eldorado spring outside Boulder. Stranahan's initially used wash from Flying Dog Brewery, before moving to a larger facility and making their own wash beginning in 2009. =Packaging= Each barrel is bottled by hand, with each label hand-signed by the distiller, often including a note about, for instance, the music listened to during the whiskey's production. The bottling process is done by volunteers, who receive a free tour and a bottle of Stranahan's for their efforts. Volunteers can sign up online on the Stranahan's website - a random lottery picks volunteers from this list for each bottling crew. Current estimates show the waiting list to be 20,000+ people long. The bottle features a metal cap, inspired by the old barroom practice of covering bottles with tin cups when the corks dry out. =Stranahan's Blue Peak Whiskey= In 2020, Stranahan’s added Blue Peak to its line of Rocky Mountain whiskeys. In this process, they couple the high altitude distillation process and aging methods with a Solera finish, a maturation process typically used in wine, resulting in a rich and mellow whiskey. This is bottled at 43% ABV and is said the lowest-priced Stranahan's introduced to date =Stranahan's Mountain Angel 10-Year-Old Whiskey = As a one time only release in 2020, Stranahan's released Mountain Angel 10-Year-Old whiskey. This was the brand’s oldest, rarest release to date. They say it is the first and only American single malt aged of its kind 10 years in new charred American oak casks with less than 500 bottles available at 47.3% ABV. =Snowflake Series= Once a year, Stranahan's creates a limited Snowflake Series, available for purchase only at the Denver distillery, and so called because each batch is unique, like a snowflake. In the Snowflake Series, the standard Stranahan's whiskey is finished in oak casks previously filled with wine from local wineries or other spirits, sitting in the casks for roughly 18 months. When new bottles of Snowflake are set to be released, Stranahan's makes an announcement on their Facebook and Twitter accounts, and people typically camp outside by the distillery the night before the release to secure a bottle. =Beer= In 2012, Stranahan's began collaborating with Colorado's Breckenridge Brewery to create Stranahan's Well Built E.S.B., an English style bitter style ale 7.8% abv beer brewed by Breckenridge and aged in Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey barrels for three months. Television and film  Stranahan's was featured in \\"Whiskey\\", an episode of the History Channel's Modern Marvels that originally aired on March 17, 2008.“Whiskey,” Modern Marvels, The History Channel, March 17, 2008. Stranahan's appears to be the whiskey of choice for character Marty Kaan in the Showtime series House of Lies.

Born in Verchères, Lower Canada, the son of Pierre Rolland and Euphrasine Donay, his family moved to Saint- Hyacinthe in 1828. In 1832, Rolland moved to Montreal where he worked as an apprentice typographer. In 1836, he worked as a journeyman for a Montreal newspaper. He later co-founded the printing firm of Rolland and Thompson and in 1843 decided to open a book shop in Montreal. He also printed and bound books. In 1859, he formed a partnership with his eldest son, Jean-Damien Rolland, and the firm was called J.-B. Rolland et Fils. His other sons would also join the partnership. In 1881, they decided to manufacture their own paper and opened a paper mill called the Rolland Paper Company (now a division of Cascades inc.). In 1861, he was elected to the Montreal City Council for the East Ward and served until 1867. He was re-elected in 1871 and served until 1875. He was called to the Senate of Canada in 1887 for the senatorial division of Mille Isles on the advice of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. A Conservative, he served barely five months until his death in 1888. His son- in-law was Raymond Préfontaine.

His massive number of published works, at over 370, makes him one of Europe's most cited immunologists. Curriculum Vitae Wagner studied Medicine and in 1967 received his medical degree (MD) from the University of Tübingen. In Melbourne, Australia he studied Human Biology and in 1973 received his PhD from University of Melbourne. From 1973 to 1983 he continued his research on \\"T Cell mediated Immune Responses\\" with Paul Klein at the Institut of Microbiology of the Johannes-Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. In 1978, he qualified as a university lecturer (habilitation), and in 1983 he was made full professor and head of the Institut of Microbiology at the University of Ulm. In 1989 he moved to the Technical University Munich, where he headed the Institute of Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene. He retired at the end of 2008. Research work His prime research activities focus on mechanisms of protective immunity towards pathogens. From 1970-80 he analysed T-T Cell interactions during the induction of cytotoxic T Cell responses. During his Ulm period he focussed on the immunobiology of bacterial superantigens. In Munich, he subsequently contributed to our understanding of Toll-like- Receptors(TLR), through which innate immune cells sense pathogens. In particular he was one of the first to realise that bacterial/viral DNA activated Innate Immune cells via TLR9. Conversely his group was able to show that TLR7 and/or TLR8 recognised pathogen-derived RNA while TLR13 senses bacterial 23S rRNA. In Ulm he initiated and headed the Collaborative Research Program of the German Research Council (Sonderforschungsbereich) entitled \\"Lympo-Haemopoese\\". In Munich he expanded the research area \\"Infection and Immunity\\" to a major research focus of his faculty. He co-initiated three Collaborative Research Programs and was from 1999-2006 speaker of the program \\"Target structures for selective Tumor-Interventions\\". His honorary functions include: Presidency of the German Society of Immunology, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine (TUM), and Chairmen of the Science Advisory Board-IZKF-University Würzburg. A number of his pupills (n=13) are now heading university departments or other science-institutions; hence, Wagner and his pupills operate a creative academic school in Germany. Honors and awards In 1988 Wagner received the Behring-Kitasato Prize from the Hoechst Japan, and in 2001 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Würzburg. In 2003 he received the \\"Order of Merit\\" of the Federal Republic of Germany. He has been an honorary member of the German Society of Immunology since 2007. He received the \\"Bavarian Order of Merit\\" in 2007. He is member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 2009 he was Fellow of the A. Krupp Science Foundation in Greifswald/Baltic Sea, and in 2012 guest professor at the University of Marburg. Since 2011 he is TUM-Emeritus of Excellence. In 2013 he was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Bonn.

It originates at the confluence of Salmon Creek and Arroyo Sausal and empties into Tomales Bay south of Dillon Beach, California. History Walker Creek is named for an early landowner in the area, Lewis W. Walker. Chileno Creek is named for Chilean immigrants who settled the Chileno Valley, with encouragement from Adrian Godoy. Keys Creek is named for Irish settler John Keyes, who settled on the creek in 1849 and used this once- important waterway to transport agricultural produce to San Francisco. Watershed and course The Walker Creek watershed drains and ranges from to sea level where the creek empties into Tomales Bay just south of its mouth. The Walker Creek mainstem is formed by the confluence of Arroyo Sausal and Salmon Creek. Arroyo Sausal heads at about and flows northwest, crossing Point Reyes-Petaluma Road into Hicks Valley then west to Soulajule Reservoir. This reservoir was constructed in 1968 in Arroyo Sausal and is managed by the Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD). The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Soulajule Reservoir due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. From here Arroyo Sausal joins Walker Creek at elevation at Marshall-Petaluma Road. Salmon Creek heads at and flows west along Hicks Valley Road then Marshall- Petaluma Road to meet Arroyo Sausal and form Walker Creek. Salmon Creek was described historically as a salmon and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) spawning and nursery area, although it has been seriously damaged by poor farming practices, dairy pollution and soil erosion. From the confluence of Arroyo Sausal and Salmon Creek, Walker Creek descends to the northwest, paralleling Marshall-Petaluma Road as it curves westward. At the mouth of Verde Canyon, the creek crosses under the road and turns northwest, passing the mouth of Frink Canyon to a confluence with Chileno Creek. At the top of the Chileno Valley, a natural lake, Laguna Lake, which straddles the Sonoma County - Marin County border and is the source of Chileno Creek, which flows west along Bolinas Ridge to Walker Creek. From the Chileno Creek confluence, Walker Creek meanders westward, passing south of the town of Tomales, California. It crosses under Highway 1 at milepost 44.45 and is immediately joined by Keys Creek, entering from the north. Keys Creek heads at and flows west through the town of Tomales below which it joins Walker Creek. Below Keys Creek, Walker Creek continues southward along the Highway 1 to enter Tomales Bay just east of Preston Point. Ecology In the early 1900s, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were abundant in Walker Creek, but were nearly extirpated apparently due to severe erosion and siltation secondary to overgrazing and logging operations. In 1975 D. W. Kelley performed a comprehensive investigation of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon populations. He found small numbers of steelhead young-of-the-year in all viable habitat areas in the watershed, but only eight coho near the confluence of Chileno and Walker Creek. In addition, the Soulajule Reservoir dam blocked all anadromous salmonid fish migration to Arroyo Sausal. California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) began planting coho salmon from Olema Creek into Walker Creek in 2003 with modest success. In 2008 and again in 2013 coho returned to Walker Creek, Salmon Creek and Frink Canyon. Fishing for steelhead is open only below Highway 1. Portions of Keyes Creek immediately downstream of the present Highway One bridge were once navigable and used to ship locally-grown potatoes by barge to San Francisco. The current small size of the channel at this location, more suitable for a canoe than a barge, is dramatic evidence of siltation due to erosive agricultural practices in the Walker Creek watershed over the past 150 years. Mercury was mined at several sites in the Walker Creek watershed through the 1960s and early 1970s including the Gambonini, Chileno Valley, Franciscan and Cycle mines. Soulajule Reservoir, built after a severe drought in 1976–1977 inundated the Franciscan and Cycle mines and a tailings pile. The largest mine, at the Gambonini Ranch near the confluence of Salmon Creek and mainstem Walker Creek, closed in 1970.

Guam and The Northern Mariana Islands mark its eastern limit. The Mariana Trough is an active back-arc basin in the western Pacific Ocean . It is an integral part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc system. Location and Bathymetry The Mariana Trough stretches 1300 km from north to south, about the distance from Los Angeles CA to Portland OR, Tokyo, Japan to Seoul, Korea, or London, England to Rome, Italy. The Mariana Trough has roughly the dimensions and areal extent of Japan or California. The Trough is crudely crescent-shaped, opening on the south; it is bounded to the east by the active Mariana arc, to the west by the remnant arc of the West Mariana Ridge , and to the south by the Challenger Deep, part of the Mariana Trench. It narrows northward until the Mariana arc and West Mariana Ridge meet at about 24°N. It is widest in the middle, at 18°N, where it is about 240 km wide, and narrows to about half this at its southern, open end. Depths in the basin are distributed asymmetrically, being greater adjacent to the West Mariana Ridge than next to the active arc, due to a westward-thinning wedge of volcaniclastic sediments derived from the active arc, and also less thermal buoyancy of the mantle. Where not covered by sediments, the seafloor is deeper and bathymetry more rugged than normal. The most recent, \\"zero-age\\" seafloor of the Philippine Sea, including the Mariana Trough, lies at a mean depth of 3200 m compared to normal zero-age seafloor depths of 2500 m . Bathymetry of the Mariana Trough and surroundings. The figure was generated by Dr. F. Martinez University of Hawaii using open source software GMT version 4.14 and data bases (Smith and Sandwell and Smith global measured and predicted bathymetry file topo_9.1.img, ) Extension style The extension axis for the Mariana Trough can be subdivided along strike into a southern two-thirds characterized by slow seafloor spreading and a northern third characterized by rifting. From as far north as 19°45'N south to 13°10’N, the spreading ridge has the typical morphology of a slow-spreading ridge, with an axial graben that is sometimes occupied by a central ridge where volcanic activity is concentrated (neovolcanic zone); south of this the ridge more resembles a fast-spreading ridge, probably because magma supply is enhanced by proximity to the arc . Spreading half-rates in the region between 16° and 18°N are estimated at 1.5 to 2.2 cm/year . The ridge becomes punctiform north of 18°30', and true seafloor spreading does not occur north of 19°45'N (but see the different conclusion of ). Rifting forms a series of amagmatic deeps between 19°45'N and 21°10'N called the 'Central Graben' . These basins have low heatflow, lack igneous activity, and are the deepest parts of the Mariana Trough (>5400 m). The deepest part of the Central Graben is also unique among active back-arc basins in exposing mantle peridotites along the extension axis . Extension north of the Central Graben occurs by combined tectonic and magmatic processes that are distinct from seafloor spreading, in a region known as the Volcano-Tectonic Zone (VTZ; ). The VTZ corresponds with a part of the Mariana Trough where the crust thickens from 6 to 15 km. The southern VTZ is dominated by fissure eruptions associated with a ridge-like feature, ~30 km long, which rises to less than 2800 m water depth and which is similar to the inflated segment at the southern terminus of the spreading ridge. The northern VTZ is dominated by point-source volcanism, with edifices spaced 50–60 km apart alternating with rift basins. There is no volcanic activity along the adjacent arc segment and it appears that the extension axis has captured the arc magma supply between the Kasuga cross-chain at 22°N and Nikko near 23°N, where the extension axis intersects the arc. North of this, incipient rifting is magmatically manifested by unusual, shoshonitic lavas of the Hiyoshi complex, Fukutoku-oka-no-ba (or Sin Iwo Jima), and Iwo Jima . Rifting and spreading are inferred to be propagating northward at a rate of 10 to 40 cm/year , so the variations in tectonic and magmatic style seen along-strike north of 18°N provide an example of the sequence of events that occur at any one section across the back-arc basin as the rift evolves from updoming through rifting to true spreading.

History  The Rio Negro was founded on May 1, 1912 by Fernando Emilio Rajneri. At first the newspaper was published fortnightly but later weekly. Since 1958 the newspaper has circulated as a daily. An on-line version has been available since August 5, 1997. The current chief executive of the newspaper, Julio Rajneri, is a son of the founder, and a former national Minister of Education, who served during Alfonsín's term of office.  Style  Since its foundation, the newspaper has been very reader-focused. Its articles mostly address local and regional affairs. It was one of the few publications to criticise the military government (1976–1983), when it published articles about the kidnappings and other violations of human rights during that period.

It is located in northwestern Jordan and is part of the Irbid Governorate. Zoubia is known for its abundant oak forests and its mountains, which are considered the highest in Irbid. For most of known history, Zoubians worked in agriculture. Chief crops included olives, grapes and figs, while some farmers focused on seasonal crops such as wheat, barley, lentils and tomatoes. The villagers also used to raise cattle, sheep and horses. Nowadays, the majority of the population have taken on other jobs to live, leaving very few to work in agriculture. History In 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers named as Zubiya, situated in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Kura, part of the Sanjak of Ajlun. It had 14 households and 6 bachelors; all Muslim; and 7 Christian households.

Isaac Weld JP FGSD MRIA (1774–1856) was an Irish topographical writer, explorer, and artist. He was a member of the Royal Dublin Society . Early life He was born on 15 March 1774 on Fleet Street, Dublin, Ireland. His name stems from his great grandfather Nathanael Weld's close friendship with Sir Isaac Newton, and as such both his grandfather and father were also named Isaac. His father was a close friend of Charles James Fox. His sister married George Ensor, and their half-brother was Charles Richard Weld,Scientists traveller and author of A Vacation Tour in the United States and Canada (London, 1855), which was dedicated to his brother, Isaac. He was sent to the school of Samuel Whyte at Grafton Street and from there to another private school Barbauld at Palgrave near the town of Diss in Norfolk. From Diss he proceeded to Norwich as a private pupil of Dr William Enfield. He left Norwich in 1793. He married Alexandra Hope in Edinburgh in 1802. He had a daughter Esther, named after his sister, born 7 January 1804. In later life, Weld spent much time in Italy and particularly Rome, where he developed a friendship with Antonio Canova.  Travels in the United States and Canada  Book/Drawings by Isaac Weld In 1795 he sailed to Philadelphia from Dublin and spent two years travelling in the United States and Canada. He visited Monticello and Mount Vernon and met George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. He journeyed to the United States and Canada partly as an adventure and partly as research into suitable countries for the Irish to emigrate to: \\"any part of those territories might be looked forward to as an eligible and agreeable place of abode\\". He travelled on horseback, by coach and by canoe in Canada with local native guides. He returned in 1797 \\"without entertaining the slightest wish to revisit it.\\" He found the Americans to be obsessed with material things and preferred Canada. His published Travels (1799) quickly went into three editions and was translated into French, German, Italian, and Dutch.  Quotes from Travels Through the States of North America...  Weld wrote on slavery that \\"there will be an end to slavery in the United States…[as] negroes will not remain deaf to the inviting call of liberty forever.\\" With regard to Americans in general, he stated, \\"civility cannot be purchased from them on any terms; they seem to think that it is incompatible with freedom\\". On Washington, DC, he wrote \\"If the affairs of the United States go on as rapidly as they have done, it will become the grand emporium of the West, and rival in magnitude and splendour the cities of the whole world.\\"  Ireland  He visited Killarney, navigated the lakes in a boat he made from compressed brown paper, and published Scenery of Killarney (1807), illustrated with his own drawings. He is also well known for his drawings of American life and, in particular, the Niagara Falls. In May 1815 he sailed from Dún Laoghaire to London in the steamboat Thames, the first such vessel to make the passage. He compiled the Statistical Survey of the County of Roscommon (1838) for the Royal Dublin Society, of which he was Honorary Secretary and Vice-President. He died at his home, Ravenswell, near Bray, County Wicklow, 4 August 1856, and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin  The Welds of New England  The Horseshoe Falls, Niagara by Issac Weld Isaac Weld is part of the Weld family of New England. His ancestor, Thomas Weld, was a Puritan minister from Suffolk, England who was one of three brothers who emigrated to Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1632. Isaac Weld's great, great grandfather Thomas Weld helped to publish the Bay Psalm Book, the first book published in America. Eventually he returned to England and Gateshead. Isaac's great grandfather (Nathaniel), was graduated at Harvard College. He left Massachusetts for Kinsale and then Blarney Castle, County Cork, Ireland (1655) to be a Puritan Chaplain with Oliver Cromwell. He later moved to Dublin. The family that stayed in America grew in wealth and influence and includes such notables as Governor of Massachusetts William Weld, Isabel Weld Perkins, and Theodore Dwight Weld.

The Criodrilidae are characterised by holoic nephridia absent from anterior segments (cf. Pontodrilus), a simple gut with no gizzard and no typhlosole. They are true earthworms, having a complex vascular system with capillaries, the male pores (on 15 or 13) behind the female pores (on 14) and a multicelled clitellum. They were at one time placed in the earthworm families Glossoscolecidae or Almidae, but at present are considered to constitute their own family. Criodrilidae species (criodrilids) are found in mud next to lakes and waterways (cf. North American Sparganophilus). They feed in the low-oxygen mud and organic material, but with their highly vascularized posterior region on or near the surface.

Variations of the dish use beef, chicken, or pork. Commonly, the goat meat is stewed with vegetables and liver paste. Vegetables may include tomatoes, potatoes, olives, bell peppers, and hot peppers. Kaldereta sometimes includes tomato sauce. Caldereta's name is derived from the Spanish word caldera meaning cauldron. The dish is similar to meat stews from the Iberian Peninsula and was brought to the Philippines by the Spaniards during their 300-year occupation in the Philippines. It also has its similarities with afritada and mechado that it uses tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and bell peppers as its ingredients. Kaldereta is served during special occasions, parties, and festivities.  Preparation  Start by heating around 1/4 cup of cooking oil in a stock pot. Cook onion, garlic and goat meat, beef or chicken and sauté until the meat is browned. For beef, a pressure cooker can be used to tenderize the meat faster before sautéing. This method can shorten tenderization by half rather than cooking via the stove top method. For goat meat, extra procedures are required compared to other meats as it can be gamy. To prevent this, the meat is marinated in vinegar, salt and ground black pepper at least an hour before cooking. For chicken, marinating the meat with pineapple juice and soy sauce can boost its flavor. Add in tomato sauce, bay leaf, salt, sugar and water to the pot and simmer for 1 hour and a half to 2 hours. When the meat is tender enough, the bell pepper, potato, carrot and hot sauce can be added and the whole mixture is to be simmered for an additional 10 minutes. Lastly, the liver paste and green peas are stirred in the mixture and is simmered for another 5 minutes. Green olives may be added to provide a nice sour flavor to compliment the other ingredients. Garnish with shredded cheese on top of the stew and serve with rice.

It is the largest species in the genus Ctenosaura and has been recorded as the fastest-running species of lizard.  Taxonomy  The black spiny-tailed iguana was first described by British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1831. The generic name, Ctenosaura, is derived from two Greek words: ctenos (Κτενός), meaning \\"comb\\" (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (σαύρα), meaning \\"lizard\\". Its specific name is the Latin word similis meaning \\"similar to\\", a common description found in Linnean taxonomy when referring to a new taxon.  Description  Black spiny-tailed iguana have distinctive black, keeled scales on their long tails, which gives them their common name. They, along with C. pectinata, are the largest members of the genus Ctenosaura. The males are capable of growing up to in length and the females are slightly shorter, at . They have a crest of long spines which extends down the center of the back. Although coloration varies extremely among individuals of the same population, adults usually have a whitish gray or tan ground color with a series of 4–12 well-defined dark dorsal bands that extend nearly to the ventral scales. Males also develop an orange color around the head and throat during breeding season with highlights of blue and peach on their jowls. Diet and behavior Ctenosaura similis, Costa Rica In tree, Manuel Antonio National Park, Costa Rica Black spiny-tailed iguanas are excellent climbers, and prefer a rocky habitat with plenty of crevices to hide in, rocks to bask on, and nearby trees to climb. They are diurnal and fast moving, employing their speed to escape predators but will lash with their tails and bite if cornered. The Guinness Book of World Records lists this as the world's fastest lizard, with a maximal sprint speed of 34.6 km/h. They are primarily herbivorous, eating flowers, leaves, stems, and fruit, but they will opportunistically eat smaller animals, eggs and arthropods. Juveniles tend to be insectivores, becoming more herbivorous as they get older.Van Devender, R. W. 1982. Growth and ecology of spiny-tailed and green iguanas in Costa Rica, with comments on the evolution of herbivory and large body size. Pages 162-182 in G. M. Burghardt and A. S. Rand, eds. Iguanas of the world: their behavior, ecology, and conservation. Park Ridge, New Jersey, Noyes Publications. They are known to eat the fruit and live in the limbs of the manchineel, a tree highly poisonous to most other animals.  Distribution  The black spiny- tailed iguana is native to Central America, and has the widest range of all Ctenosaura species from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to northeastern Nicaragua and western Panama on the respective Atlantic and Pacific coasts. It is commonly found throughout Costa Rica, Honduras and has been reported in Colombia. In addition to its varied appearance it may interbreed with other Ctenosaur species throughout this range. The black spiny-tailed iguana has been introduced to South Florida and reproduces in the wild in several feral populations. On the southeastern Florida coast, black spiny-tailed iguanas have been found on Key Biscayne, Hialeah, and in Broward County. On the southwestern Florida coast, it has been discovered on Gasparilla Island and in adjacent areas, throughout Lee and Charlotte counties.Krysko, K. L. & King, F. W. & Enge, K. M. & Reppas, A. T. (2003):Sarasota county Distribution of the introduced black spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis) on the southwestern coast of Florida.- Florida Scientist, Lawrence, Kansas; 66 (2): 74-79. This iguana has also been introduced to several islands in the Caribbean. As this species will opportunistically feed on small vertebrates, such as fish, rodents, eggs, birds, and even hatchling sea turtles it may pose a threat to endangered native species.  Reproduction  Mating generally occurs in the spring. Males show dominance and interest by head bobbing; eventually the male will chase the female until he can catch her and subdue her. Within eight to ten weeks, the female will dig a nest and lay clutches of up to 30 eggs. The eggs hatch in 90 days with the hatchlings digging their way out of the sand. These juveniles are typically green with brown markings, although all brown hatchlings have been recorded as well. Commercial usage Ctenosaura similis, Tulum, Mexico In some parts of Central America, the black spiny- tailed iguana, colloquially called the \\"chicken of the trees,\\" is farmed alongside the green iguana as a food source and for export for the pet trade [see iguana meat]. Although it is heavily hunted it does not appear to be endangered in any of its native territory.

It broadcasts on XHRU-FM 105.3 FM and XHERU-FM 106.9 FM. History =First era of Radio Universidad: 1957-72= The first graduates of the Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua had not yet graduated when the permit for XERU-AM 1310 kHz was issued on May 21, 1957. Then-rector Luis Raúl Flores Sánchez was one of the important exponents of the cultural radio project. The UACh radio station also received a shortwave counterpart, XERUU at 6140 kHz. The original studios were located in the Fine Arts Building, on what is today Campus 1, while the transmitter tower was on property belonging to the Instituto Tecnológico de Chihuahua. The two locations were connected by a studio-transmitter link prone to failing in high winds. Early programming included some initial efforts at distance education, such as the \\"radio schools\\" program that saw programs being transmitted over shortwave to small communities without their own schools. Four hours a day, five days a week were devoted to the radioescuelas, while the rest of the station in the 1960s and early 1970s included a wide variety of musical programming. Meanwhile, the transmitter was moved closer to the Fine Arts Building, on land that would later be used to construct the university gym. In the summer of 1972, a strike at UACh's preparatory unit would lead to the station going off the air and not returning until 1989; the 1972 strike also marked the definitive end of the shortwave service. =Radio Universidad returns: 1989-97= On November 14, 1989, XERU-AM returned to the air after an absence of more than 17 years. Radio Universidad now had new studio facilities in a different building; the transmitter was also relocated. After a forced closure that began in July 1993 and came about due to technical problems and the need to restructure the station's departments, Radio Universidad returned on April 9, 1994 with the slogan \\"A New Signal for You\\" (Una Nueva Señal para Tí) and a more modern programming concept. =Into the FM era= In the 1990s, the UACh, understanding that the radio station needed to be modernized, began to seek a permit to operate an FM radio station. The official request for a permit was made in November 1997, and the official permit was issued on September 2, 1998, for XHRU-FM 105.3, with 3 kW ERP. With the permit, the station began to acquire the equipment to put an FM station on the air. The Central Library would house the transmitter, donated through an agreement with the state government. Finally, on March 2000, 105.3 FM came to air with a program schedule that partly simulcast its AM counterpart. In the late 2000s, the Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua solicited authorization to move XERU-AM to the FM band as part of the AM-FM migration scheme. The new FM station would be located on 106.9 FM and bear the XHERU-FM callsign. As part of 60th anniversary celebrations for the university, 106.9 FM came to air on August 13, 2014.\\"Inicia Radio Universidad trasmisiones en el 106.9 de frecuencia modulada\\", Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua, 13 August 2014 A year later, the AM station was shut down after nearly six decades of service.\\"Radio Universidad en Chihuahua termina transmisiones en AM\\", Notimex, 28 August 2015 =Statewide expansion= In 2015, UACh obtained a public concession to expand its signal outside of the capital city for the first time, to Ciudad Cuauhtémoc on XHRUC-FM 105.7, with 3 kW ERP;RPC: Concession for XHRUC-FM this station signed on at the end of 2016. After 10 years of waiting, the IFT approved concessions to the university for two additional stations, XHPEFK-FM 89.1 Hidalgo del Parral and XHPEDL-FM 92.1 Ciudad Delicias, in early 2019. Programming 105.3 and 106.9 FM carry separate programming; 1310 repeated 106.9 in its final year of operation. Programming includes university news, cultural programs, and music.

As such, optogenetics is a neuromodulation method that uses a combination of techniques from optics and genetics to control the activities of individual neurons in living tissue—even within freely-moving animals. In some usages, optogenetics also refers to optical monitoring of neuronal activity and control of biochemical pathways in non-neuronal cells, although these research activities preceded the use of light-sensitive ion channels in neurons. As optogenetics is used by some authors to refer to only optical control of the activity of genetically defined neurons and not these additional research approaches, the term optogenetics is an example of polysemy. Neuronal control is achieved using optogenetic actuators like channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and archaerhodopsin, while optical recording of neuronal activities can be made with the help of optogenetic sensors for calcium (GCaMPs), vesicular release (synapto-pHluorin), neurotransmitters (GluSnFRs), or membrane voltage (Quasars, ASAPs). Control (or recording) of activity is restricted to genetically defined neurons and performed in a spatiotemporal-specific manner by light. In 2010, optogenetics was chosen as the \\"Method of the Year\\" across all fields of science and engineering by the interdisciplinary research journal Nature Methods.Primer on Optogenetics: Editorial: Commentary: At the same time, optogenetics was highlighted in the article on \\"Breakthroughs of the Decade\\" in the academic research journal Science. History In 1979, Francis Crick suggested that controlling all cells from one type in the brain while leaving the others more or less unaltered is a real challenge for neuroscience. Francis Crick speculated that a technology using light might be useful to control neuronal activity with temporal and spatial precision but at the time there was no technique to make neurons responsive to light. By early 1990s LC Katz and E Callaway had shown that light could uncage glutamate. Heberle and Büldt in 1994 had already shown functional heterologous expression of a bacteriorhodopsin for light-activated ion flow in yeast. Later in 1995, Georg Nagel et al. and Ernst Bamberg tried the heterologous expression of microbial rhodopsins (also bacteriorhodopsin and also in a non-neural system, Xenopus oocytes) (Nagel et al., 1995, FEBS Lett.) and showed light-induced current. An earlier use of light to activate neurons was carried out by Richard Fork, who demonstrated laser activation of neurons within intact tissue, although not in a genetically-targeted manner. The earliest genetically targeted method that used light to control rhodopsin- sensitized neurons was reported in January 2002, by Boris Zemelman and Gero Miesenböck, who employed Drosophila rhodopsin cultured mammalian neurons. In 2003, Zemelman and Miesenböck developed a second method for light-dependent activation of neurons in which single ionotropic channels TRPV1, TRPM8 and P2X2 were gated by photocaged ligands in response to light. Beginning in 2004, the Kramer and Isacoff groups developed organic photoswitches or \\"reversibly caged\\" compounds in collaboration with the Trauner group that could interact with genetically introduced ion channels. TRPV1 methodology, albeit without the illumination trigger, was subsequently used by several laboratories to alter feeding, locomotion and behavioral resilience in laboratory animals. However, light-based approaches for altering neuronal activity were not applied outside the original laboratories, likely because the easier to employ channelrhodopsin was cloned soon thereafter. Peter Hegemann, studying the light response of green algae at the University of Regensburg, had discovered photocurrents that were too fast to be explained by the classic g-protein- coupled animal rhodopsins. Teaming up with the electrophysiologist Georg Nagel at the Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt, they could demonstrate that a single gene from the alga Chlamydomonas produced large photocurrents when expressed in the oocyte of a frog. To identify expressing cells, they replaced the cytoplasmic tail of the algal protein with the fluorescent protein YFP, generating the first generally applicable optogenetic tool. They stated in the 2003 paper that \\"expression of ChR2 in oocytes or mammalian cells may be used as a powerful tool to increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration or to depolarize the cell membrane, simply by illumination\\". Karl Deisseroth in the Bioengineering Department at Stanford published the notebook pages from early July 2004 of his initial experiment showing light activation of neurons expressing a channelrhodopsin). In August 2005, Karl Deisseroth's laboratory including graduate students Ed Boyden and Feng Zhang published the first demonstration of a single-component optogenetic system, in neurons (in collaboration with Georg Nagel,) using the channelrhodopsin-2(H134R)-eYFP construct from Nagel and Hegemann. Zhuo-Hua Pan of Wayne State University, researching on restore sight to blindness, tried channelrhodopsin out in ganglion cells—the neurons in our eyes that connect directly to the brain. Pan's first observation of optical activation of retinal neurons with channelrhodopsin was in August 2004 according to Pan, a month after Deisseroth's initial observation. Indeed, the transfected neurons became electrically active in response to light, and in 2005, Zhuo-Hua Pan reported successful in-vivo transfection of channelrhodopsin in retinal ganglion cells of mice, and electrical responses to photostimulation in retinal slice culture In April 2005, Susana Lima and Miesenböck reported the first use of genetically-targeted P2X2 photostimulation to control the behaviour of an animal. They showed that photostimulation of genetically circumscribed groups of neurons, such as those of the dopaminergic system, elicited characteristic behavioural changes in fruit flies. In October 2005, Lynn Landmesser and Stefan Herlitze also published the use of channelrohodpsin-2 to control neuronal activity in cultured hippocampal neurons and chicken spinal cord circuits in intact developing embryos. In addition, they introduced for the first time vertebrate rhodopsin, a light-activated G protein coupled receptor, as a tool to inhibit neuronal activity via the recruitment of intracellular signaling pathways also in hippocampal neurons and the intact developing chicken embryo. The groups of Alexander Gottschalk and Georg Nagel made the first ChR2 mutant (H134R) and were first to use channelrhodopsin-2 for controlling neuronal activity in an intact animal, showing that motor patterns in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans could be evoked by light stimulation of genetically selected neural circuits (published in December 2005). In mice, controlled expression of optogenetic tools is often achieved with cell-type- specific Cre/loxP methods developed for neuroscience by Joe Z. Tsien back in the 1990s to activate or inhibit specific brain regions and cell-types in vivo. In 2007, the labs of Edward Boyden and Karl Deisseroth (together with the groups of Alexander Gottschalk and Georg Nagel) simultaneously reported successful optogenetic inhibition of activity in neurons. In 2007, Georg Nagel group and Peter Hegemann group started the optogenetic manipulation of cAMP. In 2014, Avelar et al. reported the first rhodopsin-guanylyl cyclase gene from fungus. In 2015, Scheib et al. and Gao et al. characerized the activity of the rhodopsin-guanylyl cyclase gene. And Shiqiang Gao et al. and Georg Nagel, Alexander Gottschalk identified it as the first 8 TM enzyme rhodopsin. In parallel to the development of optogentic actuators, optogenetic sensors of activity were developed, for example genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs). The first GECI to be used to image activity in an animal was cameleon, designed by Atsushi Miyawaki, Roger Tsien and coworkers. Cameleon was first used successfully in an animal by Rex Kerr, William Schafer and coworkers to record from neurons and muscle cells of the nematode C. elegans. Cameleon was subsequently used to record neural activity in flies and zebrafish. In mammals, the first GECI to be used in vivo was GCaMP, first developed by Nakai and coworkers. GCaMP has undergone numerous improvements, and GCaMP6 in particular has become widely used throughout neuroscience.

A nematode expressing the light- sensitive ion channel Mac. Mac is a proton pump originally isolated in the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans and now expressed in the muscle cells of C. elegans that opens in response to green light and causes hyperpolarizing inhibition. Of note is the extension in body length that the worm undergoes each time it is exposed to green light, which is presumably caused by Mac's muscle-relaxant effects. spicule, as would be seen naturally during copulation. Optogenetics provides millisecond-scale temporal precision which allows the experimenter to keep pace with fast biological information processing (for example, in probing the causal role of specific action potential patterns in defined neurons). Indeed, to probe the neural code, optogenetics by definition must operate on the millisecond timescale to allow addition or deletion of precise activity patterns within specific cells in the brains of intact animals, including mammals (see Figure 1). By comparison, the temporal precision of traditional genetic manipulations (employed to probe the causal role of specific genes within cells, via \\"loss-of-function\\" or \\"gain of function\\" changes in these genes) is rather slow, from hours or days to months. It is important to also have fast readouts in optogenetics that can keep pace with the optical control. This can be done with electrical recordings (\\"optrodes\\") or with reporter proteins that are biosensors, where scientists have fused fluorescent proteins to detector proteins. An example of this is voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein (VSFP2). Additionally, beyond its scientific impact optogenetics represents an important case study in the value of both ecological conservation (as many of the key tools of optogenetics arise from microbial organisms occupying specialized environmental niches), and in the importance of pure basic science as these opsins were studied over decades for their own sake by biophysicists and microbiologists, without involving consideration of their potential value in delivering insights into neuroscience and neuropsychiatric disease. Light- activated proteins: channels, pumps and enzymes The hallmark of optogenetics therefore is introduction of fast light-activated channels, pumps, and enzymes that allow temporally precise manipulation of electrical and biochemical events while maintaining cell-type resolution through the use of specific targeting mechanisms. Among the microbial opsins which can be used to investigate the function of neural systems are the channelrhodopsins (ChR2, ChR1, VChR1, and SFOs) to excite neurons and anion-conducting channelrhodopsins for light-induced inhibition. Indirectly light-controlled potassium channels have recently been engineered to prevent action potential generation in neurons during blue light illumination. Light-driven ion pumps are also used to inhibit neuronal activity, e.g. halorhodopsin (NpHR), enhanced halorhodopsins (eNpHR2.0 and eNpHR3.0, see Figure 2), archaerhodopsin (Arch), fungal opsins (Mac) and enhanced bacteriorhodopsin (eBR). Optogenetic control of well-defined biochemical events within behaving mammals is now also possible. Building on prior work fusing vertebrate opsins to specific G-protein coupled receptors a family of chimeric single-component optogenetic tools was created that allowed researchers to manipulate within behaving mammals the concentration of defined intracellular messengers such as cAMP and IP3 in targeted cells. Other biochemical approaches to optogenetics (crucially, with tools that displayed low activity in the dark) followed soon thereafter, when optical control over small GTPases and adenylyl cyclase was achieved in cultured cells using novel strategies from several different laboratories. Photoactivated adenylyl cyclases have been discovered in fungi and successfully used to control cAMP levels in mammalian neurons. This emerging repertoire of optogenetic actuators now allows cell-type-specific and temporally precise control of multiple axes of cellular function within intact animals. Hardware for light application Another necessary factor is hardware (e.g. integrated fiberoptic and solid-state light sources) to allow specific cell types, even deep within the brain, to be controlled in freely behaving animals. Most commonly, the latter is now achieved using the fiberoptic- coupled diode technology introduced in 2007, though to avoid use of implanted electrodes, researchers have engineered ways to inscribe a \\"window\\" made of zirconia that has been modified to be transparent and implanted in mice skulls, to allow optical waves to penetrate more deeply to stimulate or inhibit individual neurons. • Explained by To stimulate superficial brain areas such as the cerebral cortex, optical fibers or LEDs can be directly mounted to the skull of the animal. More deeply implanted optical fibers have been used to deliver light to deeper brain areas. Complementary to fiber- tethered approaches, completely wireless techniques have been developed utilizing wirelessly delivered power to headborne LEDs for unhindered study of complex behaviors in freely behaving organisms. Recent progress investigate the use of organic LEDs (OLEDs) as stimuli for optogenetics. The precise and controlled stimulation of neurons expressing microbial opsin has been demonstrated in vitro on a time scale in the order of a millisecond. Pulsed mode operation allows neural stimulation within compatible low temperature. Moreover, organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) are suitable for implantation in the brain for their very thin thickness which can be less than 1 μm. Expression of optogenetic actuators Optogenetics also necessarily includes the development of genetic targeting strategies such as cell-specific promoters or other customized conditionally-active viruses, to deliver the light-sensitive probes to specific populations of neurons in the brain of living animals (e.g. worms, fruit flies, mice, rats, and monkeys). In invertebrates such as worms and fruit flies some amount of all-trans-retinal (ATR) is supplemented with food. A key advantage of microbial opsins as noted above is that they are fully functional without the addition of exogenous co-factors in vertebrates.  Technique  Three primary components in the application of optogenetics are as follows (A) Identification or synthesis of a light-sensitive protein (opsin) such as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), halorhodopsin (NpHR), etc... (B) The design of a system to introduce the genetic material containing the opsin into cells for protein expression such as application of Cre recombinase or an adeno-associated-virus (C) application of light emitting instruments. The technique of using optogenetics is flexible and adaptable to the experimenter's needs. For starters, experimenters genetically engineer a microbial opsin based on the gating properties (rate of excitability, refractory period, etc..) required for the experiment. There is a challenge in introducing the microbial opsin, an optogenetic actuator, into a specific region of the organism in question. A rudimentary approach is to introduce an engineered viral vector that contains the optogenetic actuator gene attached to a recognizable promoter such as CAMKIIα. This allows for some level of specificity as cells that already contain and can translate the given promoter will be infected with the viral vector and hopefully express the optogenetic actuator gene. Another approach is the creation of transgenic mice where the optogenetic actuator gene is introduced into mice zygotes with a given promoter, most commonly Thy1. Introduction of the optogenetic actuator at an early stage allows for a larger genetic code to be incorporated and as a result, increases the specificity of cells to be infected. A third and rather novel approach that has been developed is creating transgenic mice with Cre recombinase, an enzyme that catalyzes recombination between two lox-P sites. Then by introducing an engineered viral vector containing the optogenetic actuator gene in between two lox-P sites, only the cells containing the Cre recombinase will express the microbial opsin. This last technique has allowed for multiple modified optogenetic actuators to be used without the need to create a whole line of transgenic animals every time a new microbial opsin is needed. After the introduction and expression of the microbial opsin, depending on the type of analysis being performed, application of light can be placed at the terminal ends or the main region where the infected cells are situated. Light stimulation can be performed with a vast array of instruments from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSS). These light sources are most commonly connected to a computer through a fiber optic cable. Recent advances include the advent of wireless head-mounted devices that also apply LED to targeted areas and as a result give the animal more freedom of mobility to reproduce in vivo results.  Issues  Although already a powerful scientific tool, optogenetics, according to Doug Tischer & Orion D. Weiner of the University of California San Francisco, should be regarded as a \\"first-generation GFP\\" because of its immense potential for both utilization and optimization. With that being said, the current approach to optogenetics is limited primarily by its versatility. Even within the field of Neuroscience where it is most potent, the technique is less robust on a subcellular level. = Selective expression = One of the main problems of optogenetics is that not all the cells in question may express the microbial opsin gene at the same level. Thus, even illumination with a defined light intensity will have variable effects on individual cells. Optogenetic stimulation of neurons in the brain is even less controlled as the light intensity drops exponentially from the light source (e.g. implanted optical fiber). Moreover, mathematical modelling shows that selective expression of opsin in specific cell types can dramatically alter the dynamical behavior of the neural circuitry. In particular, optogenetic stimulation that preferentially targets inhibitory cells can transform the excitability of the neural tissue from Type 1 — where neurons operate as integrators — to Type 2 where neurons operate as resonators. Type 1 excitable media sustain propagating waves of activity whereas Type 2 excitable media do not. The transformation from one to the other explains how constant optical stimulation of primate motor cortex elicits gamma-band (40–80 Hz) oscillations in the manner of a Type 2 excitable medium. Yet those same oscillations propagate far into the surrounding tissue in the manner of a Type 1 excitable medium. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to target opsin to defined subcellular compartments, e.g. the plasma membrane, synaptic vesicles, or mitochondria. Restricting the opsin to specific regions of the plasma membrane such as dendrites, somata or axon terminals would provide a more robust understanding of neuronal circuitry. = Kinetics and synchronization = An issue with channelrhodopsin-2 is that its gating properties don't mimic in vivo cation channels of cortical neurons. A solution to this issue with a protein's kinetic property is introduction of variants of channelrhodopsin-2 with more favorable kinetics.[55][56] Another one of the technique's limitations is that light stimulation produces a synchronous activation of infected cells and this removes any individual cell properties of activation among the population affected. Therefore, it is difficult to understand how the cells in the population affected communicate with one another or how their phasic properties of activation may relate to the circuitry being observed. Optogenetic activation has been combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) to elucidate the connectome, a thorough map of the brain's neural connections. The results, however, are limited by the general properties of fMRI. The readouts from this neuroimaging procedure lack the spatial and temporal resolution appropriate for studying the densely packed and rapid-firing neuronal circuits. = Excitation spectrum = The opsin proteins currently in use have absorption peaks across the visual spectrum, but remain considerable sensitivity to blue light. This spectral overlap makes it very difficult to combine opsin activation with genetically encoded indictors (GEVIs, GECIs, GluSnFR, synapto-pHluorin), most of which need blue light excitation. Opsins with infrared activation would, at a standard irradiance value, increase light penetration and augment resolution through reduction of light scattering. Additional data indicates that the absorption spectra of organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, used in optogenetics applications, extends from around 250 nm to around 600 nm. Particular organic compounds used in discrete portions of this range include: retinals, flavins, folates, p-coumaric acids, phytochrome chromophotes, cobalamins, and at least six fluorescent proteins including mOrange and mCherry. Applications The field of optogenetics has furthered the fundamental scientific understanding of how specific cell types contribute to the function of biological tissues such as neural circuits in vivo (see references from the scientific literature below). Moreover, on the clinical side, optogenetics-driven research has led to insights into Parkinson's disease and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, optogenetics papers in 2009 have also provided insight into neural codes relevant to autism, Schizophrenia, drug abuse, anxiety, and depression. =Identification of particular neurons and networks= Amygdala Optogenetic approaches have been used to map neural circuits in the amygdala that contribute to fear conditioning. One such example of a neural circuit is the connection made from the basolateral amygdala to the dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex where neuronal oscillations of 4 Hz have been observed in correlation to fear induced freezing behaviors in mice. Transgenic mice were introduced with channelrhodoposin-2 attached with a parvalbumin-Cre promoter that selectively infected interneurons located both in the basolateral amygdala and the dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex responsible for the 4 Hz oscillations. The interneurons were optically stimulated generating a freezing behavior and as a result provided evidence that these 4 Hz oscillations may be responsible for the basic fear response produced by the neuronal populations along the dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. Olfactory bulb Optogenetic activation of olfactory sensory neurons was critical for demonstrating timing in odor processing and for mechanism of neuromodulatory mediated olfactory guided behaviors (e.g. aggression, mating) In addition, with the aid of optogenetics, evidence has been reproduced to show that the \\"afterimage\\" of odors is concentrated more centrally around the olfactory bulb rather than on the periphery where the olfactory receptor neurons would be located. Transgenic mice infected with channel-rhodopsin Thy1-ChR2, were stimulated with a 473 nm laser transcranially positioned over the dorsal section of the olfactory bulb. Longer photostimulation of mitral cells in the olfactory bulb led to observations of longer lasting neuronal activity in the region after the photostimulation had ceased, meaning the olfactory sensory system is able to undergo long term changes and recognize differences between old and new odors. Nucleus accumbens Optogenetics, freely moving mammalian behavior, in vivo electrophysiology, and slice physiology have been integrated to probe the cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens by direct excitation or inhibition. Despite representing less than 1% of the total population of accumbal neurons, these cholinergic cells are able to control the activity of the dopaminergic terminals that innervate medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens. These accumbal MSNs are known to be involved in the neural pathway through which cocaine exerts its effects, because decreasing cocaine- induced changes in the activity of these neurons has been shown to inhibit cocaine conditioning. The few cholinergic neurons present in the nucleus accumbens may prove viable targets for pharmacotherapy in the treatment of cocaine dependence Prefrontal cortex Cages for rat equipped with optogenetic led commutators which permit in vivo study of animal behavior during optogenetic stimulations. In vivo and in vitro recordings of individual CAMKII AAV-ChR2 expressing pyramidal neurons within the prefrontal cortex demonstrated high fidelity action potential output with short pulses of blue light at 20 Hz (Figure 1). Motor cortex In vivo repeated optogenetic stimulation in healthy animals was able to eventually induce seizures. This model has been termed optokindling. Heart Optogenetics was applied on atrial cardiomyocytes to end spiral wave arrhythmias, found to occur in atrial fibrillation, with light. This method is still in the development stage. A recent study explored the possibilities of optogenetics as a method to correct for arrythmias and resynchronize cardiac pacing. The study introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into cardiomyocytes in ventricular areas of hearts of transgenic mice and performed in vitro studies of photostimulation on both open-cavity and closed-cavity mice. Photostimulation led to increased activation of cells and thus increased ventricular contractions resulting in increasing heart rates. In addition, this approach has been applied in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) as a new biological pacemaker as a substitute for electrode based-CRT. Lately, optogenetics has been used in the heart to defibrillate ventricular arrhythmias with local epicardial illumination, a generalized whole heart illumination or with customized stimulation patterns based on arrhythmogenic mechanisms in order to lower defibrillation energy. Spiral ganglion Optogenetic stimulation of the spiral ganglion in deaf mice restored auditory activity. Optogenetic application onto the cochlear region allows for the stimulation or inhibition of the spiral ganglion cells (SGN). In addition, due to the characteristics of the resting potentials of SGN's, different variants of the protein channelrhodopsin-2 have been employed such as Chronos, CatCh and f-Chrimson. Chronos and CatCh variants are particularly useful in that they have less time spent in their deactivated states, which allow for more activity with less bursts of blue light emitted. Additionally, using engineered red-shifted channels as f-Chrimson allow for stimulation using longer wavelengths, which decreases the potential risks of phototoxicity in the long term without compromising gating speed. The result being that the LED producing the light would require less energy and the idea of cochlear prosthetics in association with photo-stimulation, would be more feasible. Brainstem Optogenetic stimulation of a modified red-light excitable channelrhodopsin (ReaChR) expressed in the facial motor nucleus enabled minimally invasive activation of motoneurons effective in driving whisker movements in mice. One novel study employed optogenetics on the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus to both activate and inhibit dopaminergic release onto the ventral tegmental area. To produce activation transgenic mice were infected with channelrhodopsin-2 with a TH-Cre promoter and to produce inhibition the hyperpolarizing opsin NpHR was added onto the TH-Cre promoter. Results showed that optically activating dopaminergic neurons led to an increase in social interactions, and their inhibition decreased the need to socialize only after a period of isolation.  Visual system  Studying the visual system using optogenetics can be challenging. Indeed, the light used for optogenetic control may lead to the activation of photoreceptors, as a result of the proximity between primary visual circuits and these photoreceptors. In this case, spatial selectivity is difficult to achieve (particularly in the case of the fly optic lobe). Thus, the study of the visual system requires spectral separation, using channels that are activated by different wavelengths of light than rhodopsins within the photoreceptors (peak activation at 480 nm for Rhodopsin 1 in Drosophila). Red-shifted CsChrimson or bistable Channelrhodopsin are used for optogenetic activation of neurons (i.e. depolarization), as both allow spectral separation. In order to achieve neuronal silencing (i.e. hyperpolarization), an anion channelrhodopsin discovered in the cryptophyte algae species Guillardia theta (named GtACR1). can be used. GtACR1 is more light sensitive than other inhibitory channels such as the Halorhodopsin class of chlorid pumps and imparts a strong conductance. As its activation peak (515 nm) is close to that of Rhodopsin 1, it is necessary to carefully calibrate the optogenetic illumination as well as the visual stimulus. The factors to take into account are the wavelength of the optogenetic illumination (possibly higher than the activation peak of GtACR1), the size of the stimulus (in order to avoid the activation of the channels by the stimulus light) and the intensity of the optogenetic illumination. It has been shown that GtACR1 can be a useful inhibitory tool in optogenetic study of Drosophila's visual system by silencing T4/T5 neurons expression. These studies can also be led on intact behaving animals, for instance to probe optomotor response. =Precise temporal control of interventions= The currently available optogenetic actuators allow for the accurate temporal control of the required intervention (i.e. inhibition or excitation of the target neurons) with precision routinely going down to the millisecond level. Therefore, experiments can now be devised where the light used for the intervention is triggered by a particular element of behavior (to inhibit the behavior), a particular unconditioned stimulus (to associate something to that stimulus) or a particular oscillatory event in the brain (to inhibit the event). This kind of approach has already been used in several brain regions: Hippocampus Sharp waves and ripple complexes (SWRs) are distinct high frequency oscillatory events in the hippocampus thought to play a role in memory formation and consolidation. These events can be readily detected by following the oscillatory cycles of the on-line recorded local field potential. In this way the onset of the event can be used as a trigger signal for a light flash that is guided back into the hippocampus to inhibit neurons specifically during the SWRs and also to optogenetically inhibit the oscillation itself. These kinds of \\"closed-loop\\" experiments are useful to study SWR complexes and their role in memory. = Cellular biology/cell signaling pathways = Optogenetic control of cellular forces and induction of mechanotransduction. Pictured cells receive an hour of imaging concurrent with blue light that pulses every 60 seconds. This is also indicated when the blue point flashes onto the image. The cell relaxes for an hour without light activation and then this cycle repeats again. The square inset magnifies the cell's nucleus. Analogously to how natural light-gated ion channels such as channelrhodopsin-2 allows optical control of ion flux, which is especially useful in neuroscience, natural light-controlled signal transduction proteins also allow optical control of biochemical pathways, including both second- messenger generation and protein-protein interactions, which is especially useful in studying cell and developmental biology. In 2002, the first example of using photoproteins from another organism for controlling a biochemical pathway was demonstrated using the light-induced interaction between plant phytochrome and phytochrome-interacting factor (PIF) to control gene transcription in yeast. By fusing phytochrome to a DNA-binding domain and PIF to a transcriptional activation domain, transcriptional activation of genes recognized by the DNA-binding domain could be induced by light. This study anticipated aspects of the later development of optogenetics in the brain, for example, by suggesting that \\"Directed light delivery by fiber optics has the potential to target selected cells or tissues, even within larger, more-opaque organisms.\\" The literature has been inconsistent as to whether control of cellular biochemistry with photoproteins should be subsumed within the definition of optogenetics, as optogenetics in common usage refers specifically to the control of neuronal firing with opsins, and as control of neuronal firing with opsins postdates and utilizes distinct mechanisms from control of cellular biochemistry with photoproteins.  Photosensitive proteins utilized in various cell signaling pathways  In addition to phytochromes, which are found in plants and cyanobacteria, LOV domains(Light- oxygen-voltage-sensing domain) from plants and yeast and cryptochrome domains from plants are other natural photosensory domains that have been used for optical control of biochemical pathways in cells. In addition, a synthetic photosensory domain has been engineered from the fluorescent protein Dronpa for optical control of biochemical pathways. In photosensory domains, light absorption is either coupled to a change in protein-protein interactions (in the case of phytochromes, some LOV domains, cryptochromes, and Dronpa mutants) or a conformational change that exposes a linked protein segment or alters the activity of a linked protein domain (in the case of phytochromes and some LOV domains). Light-regulated protein-protein interactions can then be used to recruit proteins to DNA, for example to induce gene transcription or DNA modifications, or to the plasma membrane, for example to activate resident signaling proteins. CRY2 also clusters when active, so has been fused with signaling domains and subsequently photoactivated to allow for clustering- based activation. The LOV2 domain of Avena sativa(common oat) has been used to expose short peptides or an active protein domain in a light-dependent manner. Introduction of this LOV domain into another protein can regulate function through light induced peptide disorder. The asLOV2 protein, which optogenetically exposes a peptide, has also been used as a scaffold for several synthetic light induced dimerization and light induced dissociation systems (iLID and LOVTRAP, respectively). The systems can be used to control proteins through a protein splitting strategy. Photodissociable Dronpa domains have also been used to cage a protein active site in the dark, uncage it after cyan light illumination, and recage it after violet light illumination.  Temporal control of signal transduction with light  The ability to optically control signals for various time durations is being explored to elucidate how cell signaling pathways convert signal duration and response to different outputs. Natural signaling cascades are capable of responding with different outputs to differences in stimulus timing duration and dynamics. For example, treating PC12 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF, inducing a transient profile of ERK activity) leads to cellular proliferation whereas introduction of nerve growth factor (NGF, inducing a sustained profile of ERK activity) leads to differentiation into neuron-like cells. This behavior was initially characterized using EGF and NGF application, but the finding has been partially replicated with optical inputs. In addition, a rapid negative feedback loop in the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway was discovered using pulsatile activation of a photoswitchable RAF engineered with photodissociable Dronpa domains.

Delgado and starring Cantinflas, Manola Saavedra, Flor Silvestre, and child actor Paquito Fernández. The film's art direction was by Gunther Gerszo. This is Cantinflas' first Mexican color film (it was filmed in Eastmancolor, also considered as Mexico's Technicolor). Plot  Cantinflas is a down on his luck but affable shoeshiner that learns that his compadre has died in an accident. His friend's widow, Leonor (Flor Silvestre) is unable to raise her child, Chavita, so she leaves the kid with Cantinflas so she can go to Guadalajara, Jalisco in order to seek help from her parents. In the first days, Cantinflas goes to work in Chapultepec and Chavita catches a ball that some other children are playing with, and almost ends up in a fight with the owners of the ball. Cantinflas calms down the child by promising he will bring him a new ball. In order to find a better job, Cantinflas goes to school, where he tries to learn but, instead, falls in love with Raquel (Manola Saavedra), an attractive teacher who works there. While in school, he tries finding more jobs, with comic results: first, as a shoe shiner in a night club, where he gets into various incidents on his first night, including an unexpected entrance in the dancers' dressing room and an accidental entrance to Ravel's Boléro dance act performed by Elaine Bruce (from which the pun in the Spanish title is drawn, as he confuses the name of the piece, Boléro, with the name with which shoeshiners are known in Mexico, bolero, thus thinking that the dance is for him). After sabotaging the act, Cantinflas is removed from the night club. Cantinflas tries to get new jobs in Acapulco, where he tries everything to get some money, when accidentally Chavita leaves Cantinflas to climb La Quebrada. Cantinflas tries to rescue him, but he is stuck himself at the top of La Quebrada (as Chavita escapes easily to the other side) and he is obliged to make a spectacular dive. His action leads him to get a job as a lifeguard, but his incompetence when attempting to save a large woman from drowning (almost drowning himself in the process) causes him to be fired the same day. Finally, Cantinflas gets enough money to raise his godson and buys him a new big ball, but Leonor returns from Guadalajara, with a husband, a better life and a brand new ball. Chavita leaves Cantinflas and he sadly sees the scene. He encounters Raquel in a park and then he kicks a ball, hitting a policeman guarding the park; after that, he and Raquel kiss each other. The policeman looks at them smiling watching them happily stay together. Cast *Cantinflas as \\"El bolero\\", Cantinflas having enjoyed success in Around the World in Eighty Days, which earned him a Golden Globe Award, returns to Mexico to star in this film. *Manola Saavedra as Raquel, Saavedra was a Spanish expatriate who marks her film debut in this film. *Flor Silvestre as Leonor, Silvestre had already been working on films since her debut in 1950 and later continues to star in the Oscar-nominated film Animas Trujano, but was also continuing her musical career which she had previously initiated in 1943. Unlike other singers at the time, Silvestre also found a profession as an actress in film until her last appearance in 1991. *Paquito Fernández as Chavita, Paquito had appeared in film in 1955, and later continues as a child actor until 1962. *Daniel Herrera as Edelmiro *Mario Sevilla *Alberto Catalá *Roberto Meyer *Elaine Bruce as Mimí *Leonor Gómez as Maid in park *Erika Carlsson (uncredited) *Roberto Corell (uncredited) *Pedro Elviro (uncredited) *Pablo Ferrel (uncredited) *Lidia Franco (uncredited) *Elodia Hernández (uncredited) *Carlos León (uncredited) *Dina de León (uncredited) *Salvador Lozano (uncredited) *Casimiro Ortega as Foreman (uncredited) *Manuel Trejo Morales (uncredited) *Guillermo Álvarez Bianchi as Fat Tourist (uncredited)  Reception  = Box office = Though a relative box office disappointment for a Cantinflas film, it still ranked among the most profitable Mexican films of the year.

This \\"produces a powerful buzzing sound,\\" usually in short notes on a small, limited scale. Inhalation excites the harmonics of the string, while exhalation is most often accompanied by a throaty grunt, except in players with strong breath,Kirby, Percival (2009). \\"The Gora, a Stringed-wind Instrument\\", The World of South African Music: A Reader, p.36.

The harmonics used are primarily the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth. At the other end, in some areas, is a coconut shell resonator, with a tension noose wrapped around the string to adjust the pitch (Hornbostel-Sachs number: 311.121.222). The lesiba's construction is unique: \\"no other class of stringed-wind instrument has been found anywhere else in the world.\\" According to Barrow in 1806, the instrument sounds \\"like the faint murmurs of distant music that 'comes o'er the ear' without any distinction of notes.\\"Kirby (2009), p.32. Barnard in 1910 noted the loudness of the instrument, while Alberti in 1810 compared the sounds to the \\"tones of the so- called Hunting-horn,\\" presumably a reference to the shared use of the harmonic series. According to Kirby in 1934, \\"the tone is, when well produced, very pleasant, partaking of the qualities of both string and wind, reminding one of the Aeolian harp; and it can be varied in power from a faint whisper to a strong, vibrant sound, the air column of the mouth and throat acting as a resonator.\\"Kirby (2009), p.35. Though very few people alive today play this instrument, the \\"harsh, bird-like sounds\\" the instrument produces are so well recognised among the Sotho that it is used on Lesotho Radio to signal the start of the news broadcast. The lesiba is the national instrument of the Basotho, a southern African people, now located primarily in South Africa and Lesotho, and the Khoikhoi people of South Africa. The lesiba is played mostly by herdsmen and herdboys to give signals and instructions to their cattle, and, almost as much, for their own entertainment. As such, studies of the instrument may be classified as zoomusicology,Coplan (1994), p.101. and passages on the instrument are metaphorically compared to various linong ().

Based on the 1996 Nora Roberts novel of the same name, the film is about a wealthy stock dealer who bequeaths his Montana farm to his three daughters, provided they live on the ranch together for at least one year. Montana Sky is part of the Nora Roberts 2007 movie collection, which also includes Angels Fall, Blue Smoke, and Carolina Moon. The movie debuted on February 5, 2007 on Lifetime. Plot Half-sisters Willa, Tess, and Lily Mercy are left their wealthy father's multimillion-dollar estate, including his Montana ranch, after his death. The only stipulation is that the women will have to live with each other for a year. Having never previously met, the three sisters, who have very different personalities, agree to the strange situation (mostly because each of their 1/3rd share is worth eight million dollars), despite having reservations about their forced family 'reunion'. The biggest problem the women face, however, is the discovery of a saboteur in their midst. It seems that when their father died, he left some bitter enemies behind, enemies who would love to see his daughters fail. Now, in order to get what is rightfully theirs, the three siblings will have to work harder than ever before to clean up the mess their father left behind. During their trial, all three find love, and realize that maybe their situation wasn't such a bad thing after all.

Tests vary depending on the class of vehicle to be driven. In Great Britain it is administered by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) and in Northern Ireland by the Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA). The minimum age at which one can take a UK driving test is currently 16 for mopeds and 17 for cars (16 for those on the higher/enhanced rate of the mobility component of DLA or PIP). There is no upper age limit. In addition to a driving licence, a Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) certificate may be required before a moped or motorcycle is ridden.United Kingdom Government, Directgov. 2008. - \\"If you obtained a full car licence before 1 February 2001 you do not need to complete a CBT to ride a moped in Great Britain.\\" Around 1.6 million people sit the practical car test each year, with a pass rate of around 43%. The theory test has a pass rate of around 50%. To become a category B (car) licence holder, candidates pay £23 for the theory test and £62 for the practical driving test. History  UK driving licences were introduced by the Motor Car Act 1903 but no test was required. The intention was purely to identify vehicles and their drivers. The Road Traffic Act 1930 introduced age restrictions and a test for disabled drivers; this was the first formal driving test in the UK. These licences were only valid for one year from the date of issue. Legislation for compulsory testing was introduced for all new drivers with the Road Traffic Act 1934. The test was initially voluntary to avoid a rush of candidates until 1 June 1935 when all people who had started to drive on or after 1 April 1934 needed to have passed the test. Testing was suspended during World War II, and was suspended again during the Suez Crisis in 1956 to allow examiners help to administer petrol rations. Testing was also suspended between March and July 2020 in England, March and August 2020 in Wales, and tests in Northern Ireland and Scotland remain suspended (as of July 28 2020) due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Key workers were still allowed to take tests if they had submitted the correct paperwork. The driving theory test was introduced in July 1996 as a written examination, which was updated to computerised format in 2000. The hazard perception segment of the theory test was introduced in November 2002. In January 2015, new CGI clips replaced the real-life video clips in the Hazard Perception Test.  The current test Drivers wishing to gain a category B (car) licence need to pass two separate tests. First, the theory test must be passed. The candidate then has two years to pass their practical test before their theory test certificate expires and they have to take the theory again. Upon passing the practical test, drivers are given a pass certificate (acting as a temporary licence) and immediately become category B licence holders. =Theory test = The theory test is made up of two parts, both of which differ according to the type of vehicle licence the candidate is pursuing: * Multiple-choice test * Hazard perception test Both parts must be passed in order to obtain a theory test pass certificate. This enables the candidate to book a practical driving test. Candidates have two years from the date that they passed the first part of their theory test to take their practical test, or they will have to pass both parts of the theory test once again before they can book a practical test.  Multiple-choice test  This part of the theory test is performed on a computer system. The test has 50 multiple choice questions and the candidate must answer at least 43 of them correctly to pass. All questions are randomly selected from a bank of just under one thousand on a selection of topics. The test lasts for 57 minutes although candidates with certain special needs can apply for more time. All 50 questions must be answered. The test allows 15 minutes practice time at the start of the exam to get used to answering the questions and how to use the system. To answer a question the candidate simply touches their choice of answer from the listed answers on the computer screen. If a mistake is made the candidate can deselect a choice and reselect a different option. The candidate is allowed to go back to a question at any time and can also flag questions they are unsure of in order to find and return to it quickly and easily later. To pass the test, 43 of the 50 questions (86%) must be answered correctly. For lorry and bus drivers, 100 questions are asked over a 115-minute period, and 85 out of 100 must be answered correctly to pass. Prior to 3 September 2007, the car and motorcycle multiple-choice tests comprised 35 questions, with a pass mark of 30 within a 40-minute time limit.  Hazard perception  Candidates watch fourteen one-minute clips (nineteen clips for lorry and bus candidates) filmed from the perspective of a car driver or motorcyclist and have to indicate, usually by clicking a mouse button or touching the screen, when they observe a developing hazard. = Practical test = Unless one is converting a foreign licence, it is necessary to have passed both components of the theory test before sitting this exam.Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999 reg. 40(4) Passing the practical test then entitles one to hold a full UK driving licence. The test candidate must produce their provisional licence for the examiner before the test starts. The practical car test can be taken in either a manual or an automatic car; if the test is passed in an automatic car, then the full licence granted will be restricted to automatic cars only. The practical motorcycle test is split into two separate modules: the off-road module and the on-road module. To get a full motorcycle licence, the candidate needs to pass both modules. The target waiting time for a practical driving test is six weeks. However, in practice the waiting time can be considerably longer.http://drivingtestcancellations.me.uk/driving-test/ thumbleftDSA Form DL25C: Driving Test Report issued NG5 to candidates by examiners  Format  The practical car test is taken on the road, with a professionally trained DVSA examiner directing the candidate around a pre-determined route. The examiner marks the candidate for driving faults, serious faults, and dangerous faults. A candidate will fail the test if he or she accumulates any serious or dangerous faults, or more than fifteen driving faults. If a candidate accumulates several driving faults in the same category, the examiner may consider the fault habitual and mark a serious fault in that category. The test usually lasts 38 to 40 minutes in a standard test, or approximately 70 minutes when the candidate is taking an extended test after having had their licence revoked.  Eyesight test  Before getting to the car, the examiner will ask the candidate to read a car's number plate at a distance. The distance required is 20.5 metres for an old-style plate (A123 ABC) and 20 metres for a new style plate (AB51 ABC).Motor Vehicle (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999, Schedule 8 (as amended) If the candidate needs corrective lenses to do this, then they must be worn during the test. If the candidate fails to read the first number plate correctly, then the examiner asks the candidate to read a second number plate. If the candidate cannot correctly read the second number plate, then the examiner must use a tape measure to measure the correct distance between the candidate and a third number plate. If the candidate cannot read the third number plate, then the candidate is deemed to have failed and the test will not continue. The DVLA will be informed and the candidate's provisional licence will be revoked. The candidate will have to reapply for a provisional driving licence and attend a test centre to have an eyesight check before they are allowed to rebook a test. If successful, the DVSA standard eyesight test must still be completed at the candidate's next practical driving test. 30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. © Crown copyright.  Vehicle safety questions  The \\"Show me tell me\\" changed on 4 December 2017. The examiner will ask the candidate one:‘tell me’ question (where you explain how they would carry out a safety task) at the start of the test and before the candidate starts driving. This new element is to allow the candidate to demonstrate how to carry out a safety task while driving. These are phrased in the form \\"Show me...\\" and \\"Tell me...\\"; as such. The \\"show me\\" questions that may be asked while the vehicle is moving are: * \\"When it’s safe to do so, can you show me how you wash and clean the rear windscreen?\\" * \\"When it’s safe to do so, can you show me how you wash and clean the front windscreen?\\" * \\"When it’s safe to do so, can you show me how you’d switch on your dipped headlights?\\" * \\"When it’s safe to do so, can you show me how you’d set the rear demister?\\" * \\"When it’s safe to do so, can you show me how you’d operate the horn?\\" * \\"When it’s safe to do so, can you show me how you’d demist the front windscreen?\\" * \\"When it’s safe to do so, can you show me how you’d open and close the side window?\\" The \\"tell me\\" questions only require the candidate to explain how an action would be performed. They do not have to perform the action in question but will not be marked down if they have to physically demonstrate it in order to adequately explain their knowledge. There are two types of \\"tell me\\" question but the candidate will only be asked one \\"tell me\\" question in total; either one from category one or one from category two. The first type of question is asked while the candidate is seated inside the vehicle and there are 11 questions of this nature. The second type begins with \\"Open the bonnet and...\\". These questions require the candidate to exit the vehicle and open the engine compartment of the vehicle (the candidate should know how to operate the bonnet release on the vehicle they are driving). There are only three \\"open the bonnet\\" questions. Some examples of \\"tell me\\" questions are:- * \\"Tell me how you’d check that the brakes are working before starting a journey.\\" * \\"Tell me where you’d find the information for the recommended tyre pressures for this car and how tyre pressures should be checked.\\" * \\"Tell me how you make sure your head restraint is correctly adjusted so it provides the best protection in the event of a crash.\\" * \\"Tell me how you’d check the tyres to ensure that they have sufficient tread depth and that their general condition is safe to use on the road.\\" * \\"Tell me how you’d check that the headlights and tail lights are working. You don’t need to exit the vehicle.\\" The questions of the second type of \\"tell me\\" questions (i.e. \\"open the bonnet\\") are: * \\"Open the bonnet and tell me how you’d check that the engine has sufficient oil.\\" * \\"Open the bonnet and tell me how you’d check that the engine has sufficient engine coolant.\\" * \\"Open the bonnet and tell me how you’d check that you have a safe level of hydraulic brake fluid.\\" If the candidate answers one or both of the \\"show me\\" and \\"tell me\\" questions incorrectly, one driving fault is recorded. As the candidate is permitted a maximum of fifteen driving faults during the practical test, this means that they would not automatically fail the test based on their answers to these questions alone unless the examiner believed that the fault was serious.  Controlled stop  The controlled stop, more commonly referred to as the \\"emergency stop\\", is an exercise which determines the ability of the candidate to stop the vehicle promptly yet under control during a simulated emergency. The simulation is performed by the examiner raising his or her hand and saying, \\"STOP!\\". A controlled stop exercise will be carried out on every extended test and one third of normal tests. This might be an emergency stop, or the candidate might be asked to make a controlled stop in a specific location. During dangerous weather conditions, such as rain and snow, this test can be left out for safety reasons.  Manoeuvres  The driving test changed on 4 December 2017. The manoeuvres that a candidate would be asked to perform no longer include a turn in the road or a reverse to the left. Candidates may be asked to: * Reverse park into a parking space either parallel to the kerb (on road), or oblique or right-angle (in a marked bay in an off-road car park) * Park on the right hand side of the road, reverse two car lengths and re-join the traffic. (From December 2017) * Drive forward into a bay and reverse out  General driving  Generally, the candidate must demonstrate an ability to drive in various road and traffic conditions and react appropriately in actual risk situations.Motor Vehicle (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999, Schedule 8 (as amended) - page 8 The conditions typically encountered on test include driving in urban areas as well as higher speed limit roads where possible; this includes dual carriageways but not motorways as motorways in Britain can only be used by full licence holders, and learner drivers in a dual control vehicle with a licensed instructor in the passenger seat. The object of the test is to ensure that the candidate is well grounded in the basic principles of safe driving, and is sufficiently practised in them to be able to show, at the time of the test, that they are a competent and considerate driver and are not a source of danger to themselves or to other road users. The drive will include two or three normal stops at (and moving away from) the side of the road on level roads as well as on gradients, in addition to a demonstration of moving away from behind a stationary vehicle. The regulations state that the on-road driving time must be no less than 30 minutes.Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999 reg. 40(7)(b)(ii) If at any point during the test, the examiner has to intervene with any controls, this will usually but not always result in failure and could be marked on the test report as a serious or dangerous fault.  Independent driving  This part of the test was changed in December 2017. The independent portion of the practical test is now longer; having been increased from around 10 minutes to approximately 20 minutes. The candidate may be asked to follow a Satellite Navigation (satnav) device rather than follow signs. This section is included on practical driving tests for the following vehicles or licences: * Car * Motorcycle module two * Large goods vehicle (LGV) * Passenger carrying vehicle (PCV) tests * Approved driving instructor (ADI) driving ability (sometimes called 'part two') * Taxi During the independent driving section, candidates have to follow: *traffic signs to a destination, or *instructions from a satnav, or * a series of verbal instructions, or * a combination of the above. Candidates are permitted to deviate from the given route if they get lost and they will not receive any faults for this providing they are driving safely. For example, if a candidate is instructed by the satnav to proceed straight ahead at a junction but they find themselves in a 'left turn only' lane. The correct course of action would be to stay in the lane and turn left using normal and safe procedure (eg. mirrors, signal, manoeuvre). Once through the junction safely, the candidate can attempt to return to their route. A fault may be given if the candidate was to proceed straight ahead in the left turn lane as this can be dangerous to other road users. When a candidate deviates from the route the examiner may direct them back towards their destination until the candidate is able to resume independent driving. If a satnav is being used this may automatically recalculate a new route to get them back on course. If there are poor or obscured traffic signs, the examiner may give the candidate directions until they can see the next traffic sign. Candidates do not need to have a detailed knowledge of the area. If the satnav gives incorrect directions the examiner will assist the candidate with verbal direction. The satnav device (if used) is brought by the examiner and they will set it up for the candidate. The DVSA currently issues the TomTom Start 52 to its driving examiners. Some driving instructors will use this exact model during lessons in order to familiarise students with the layout of the device. If the candidate has special needs, the examiner will be able to make reasonable adjustments. For the independent driving section, this could be asking the candidate which method they prefer - following signs, or a series of directions (a maximum of three) Independent driving: the facts - DSA See also *Driving test *Compulsory Basic Training *Pass Plus *Motorbike practical test *Eco Driving *UK Road Signs References External links *Practical driving test : Directgov - Motoring (England, Scotland, Wales) *DVA practical test website (Northern Ireland) *DVA Driving Test Info *DVSA Car Driving Theory Practice Mock Questions *Driving Test Changes for 2017 *Mock Theory Test Category:Road transport in the United Kingdom Test ","title":"United Kingdom driving test"},{"id":"14958813","text":"Fairfax was a third rate frigate of the navy of the Commonwealth of England from 1653 to 1660. With the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 she was recommissioned as HMS Fairfax and served with the Royal Navy until 1674. Construction Fairfax was constructed between March and September 1653 by shipwright John Taylor of Chatham, at a total cost of £7065. She was a replacement for the Fairfax of 1650, which had burnt to the waterline in 1652. The unburnt portion of this earlier vessel was retained and built upon to construct the new ship.Winfield 2009, p. 52 As built, Fairfax was along her keel with a beam of and a hold depth of . She was a large vessel, measuring 789 tonnes burthen with a draft of . Her crew complement at launch was not recorded. However at the time of her transfer to the Royal Navy in 1660 she carried 220 men, rising to 300 in 1666 and 400 in 1672. From 1660 Fairfax carried 52 guns. In 1666 this was increased to 66, comprising twenty- two demi-cannons, four culverins, twenty-six 12-pounders and fourteen 5-pounder sakers. A further substantial increase in armament occurred in 1672, with the replacement of the unwieldy demi-cannons and an increase in total weaponry to 72 guns. Her lower deck was fitted with twenty-six iron-cast 24-pounders, supported by twenty-four 12-pounders on the upper deck. Fourteen brass sakers were placed along the quarterdeck with another four in the forecastle. Two additional sakers and two 12-pounder cannons, were located in the captain's cabin running the length of the stern. Commonwealth service Fairfax was launched in September 1653 for service in the First Anglo-Dutch War. Her first commander was Captain Edward Blagg, but he was superseded within three months by Captain John Lawson. Lawson held the captaincy until 1655, when he was replaced in turn by Blagg. Under Blagg's renewed command Fairfrax played an active role in the Battle of Santa Cruz on 20 April 1657. Blagg was replaced in 1658 by Captain Thomas Whetstone, with Fairfax assigned to the Commonwealth squadron stationed in the Mediterranean. Royal Navy service The English monarchy was restored to power in 1660, and Fairfax was promptly commissioned into the Royal Navy under a new commander, Captain Thomas Tiddeman. From 1661 the frigate was part of Lord Sandwich's Mediterranean fleet, and was off Tangier in May of that year and Algiers in January 1662. In October 1664 she was under the command of Captain Robert Salmon during the Battle of Lowestoft. Salmon died in October 1665 and was replaced by Captain John Watley, who died four weeks later and was replaced in turn by Captain Christopher Myngs. In 1673, after thirteen years of Royal Navy service, Fairfax struck a sandbank off the English coast. She was refloated a month later, but was found to be unserviceable. Transported to Woolwich Dockyard, she was broken up in 1674 and her timbers reused in other vessels.

The initial BERP rotor blades were developed in the late 1970s to mid-1980s as a joint venture programme between Westland Helicopters and the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), with Professor Martin Lowson as a co-patentee. The goal was to increase the helicopters lifting-capability and maximum speed using new designs and materials.  How it works  If we wish to reduce compressibility effects in forward flight, we can use sweep on the tip of a rotor blade. Many modern helicopters use some form of simple sweepback on the blade tip. Examples are the UH-60 Blackhawk and the AH-64 Apache. However, so we don't get centre of gravity or aerodynamic centre movements aft of the blade elastic axis (which can introduce undesirable aerodynamic and inertial couplings), then the tip must be configured with an area shift forward. This can be kept to a minimum by recognizing that the Mach number is varying along the blade so we do not have to use a constant sweep angle, thereby minimizing the amount of forward area shift. The methodology used in the design of the BERP blade ensures that the effective Mach number normal to the blade remains nominally constant over the swept region. The maximum sweep employed on the large part of the BERP blade is 30 degrees and the tip starts at a non-dimensional radius r/R=cos 30 = 86% radius. The area distribution of this tip region is configured to ensure that the mean tip centre of pressure is located on the elastic axis of the blade. This is done by offsetting the location of the local 1/4-chord axis forward at 86% radius. This offset also produces a discontinuity in the leading edge (referred to as a notch), which results in other interesting effects. For example, recent calculations using a CFD code based on the Navier-Stokes equations, has shown that this \\"notch\\" actually helps to further reduce the strength of shock waves on the blade. Thus, an unexpected by- product of the notch over and above the basic effect of sweep is to help to reduce compressibility effects even further. We must also recognize that a swept tip geometry of this sort will not necessarily improve the performance of the blade at high angle of attack corresponding to the retreating side of the disk. In fact, experience has shown that a swept tip blade can have an inferior stalling characteristic compared to the standard blade tip. The BERP blade employs a final geometry that performs as a swept tip at high Mach numbers and low angles of attack, yet also enables the tip to operate at very high angles of attack without stalling. This latter attribute was obtained by radically increasing the sweep of the outermost part of the tip (the outer 2% approximately) to a value (70 degrees) where any significant angle of attack will cause leading edge flow separation. Because the leading edge is so highly swept, this leading edge separation develops into a vortex structure which rolls around the leading edge and eventually sits over the upper surface (as on a delta wing aircraft). This mechanism is enhanced by making the leading edge of the aerofoil in this region relatively sharp. As the angle of attack is increased, then this vortex begins to develop from a point further and further forward along the leading edge, following the planform geometry into the more moderately swept region. At a sufficiently high angle of attack, the vortex will initiate close to the forward most part of the leading edge near the \\"notch\\" region. Evidence has shown that a strong \\"notch\\" vortex is also formed, which is trailed streamwise across the blade. This vortex acts like an aerodynamic fence and retards the flow separation region from encroaching into the tip region. Further increases in angle of attack make little change to the flow structure until a very high angle of attack is reached (in the vicinity of 22 degrees!) when the flow will grossly separate. For a conventional tip planform, a similar gross flow breakdown would be expected to occur at about 12 degrees local angle of attack. Therefore, the BERP blade manages to make the best of both worlds by reducing compressibility effects on the advancing blade and delaying the onset of retreating blade stall. The net result is a significant increase in the operational flight envelope.  Programmes  The initial programme, BERP I, studied the design, manufacture and qualification of composite rotor blades. This resulted in producing new main rotor and tail rotor blades for the Westland Sea King. Following on from the first, the second programme, BERP II, analysed advanced aerofoil sections for future rotor blades. This fed into the BERP III programme. BERP III designs have a notch toward the outer end of the rotor blade, with a greater amount of sweepback from the notch to the end of the blade compared to inboard of the notch.J. Gordon Leishman \\"ENAE 632 - The British Experimental Rotor Program (BERP) Blade \\", University of Maryland, College Park, Retrieved 11 April 2010 BERP III culminated in a technology demonstration on a Westland Lynx helicopter.Harrison, Stacey, Hansford \\"BERP IV The Design, Development, and Testing of an Advanced Rotor Blade\\" American Helicopter Society 64th Annual Forum, April 29 – May 1, 2008 In 1986, a Lynx specially modified registered G-LYNX and piloted by Trevor Egginton set an absolute speed record for helicopters over a 15 and 25 km course by reaching 400.87 km/h (249.09 mph). Following the successful technology demonstration, the BERP III blade went into production. BERP IV uses: a new aerofoil, revised blade tip shape, and increased blade twist. After 29 hours of testing it has been found to, \\"improve rotor flight-envelope performance, reduce power needs in hover and forward flight, ... decrease airframe and engine vibration for a range of take-off weights.\\" Additionally \\"Rotor hub loading has been found to be the same or less than with the BERP III blade now fitted to the EH101\\" helicopter. To prevent leading edge erosion the blade will use a rubber-based tape rather than the polyurethane used on UK navy Sea Kings. Under test it was found to last five times longer, 195 minutes vs 39 min.

The trials and troubles of the Lavigueur family have since become entrenched in Quebec popular culture for various reasons: the fact that a poor family became multimillionaires overnight; the intervention of a stranger who found the lottery ticket lost by the family's father; the judicial saga of one of the family's daughters, the only member of the family to not have participated in the purchase of the winning ticket, suing her father for a fraction of the jackpot; the subsequent family disputes that tore apart the family which dissipated its fortune, all of which received wide coverage in the mainstream media of Quebec. Jackpot The Lavigueurs lived in Centre-Sud, a poor neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec. Jean-Guy Lavigueur had been unemployed for a year and a half after having worked for 34 years at United Bedding Company. The father had been raising his four children, Sylvie, Yve, Louise and Michel, with the help of his brother-in-law Jean-Marie Daudelin, since the death of the children's mother, Micheline Daudelin, who died of sudden cardiac arrest in 1983. The couple also had two girls who died in infancy from heart problems. A few days before the draw, Jean-Guy Lavigueur lost his wallet, which was given back to him by a good Samaritan, 28-year-old William Murphy,Chris Gudgeon, Barbara Stewart, \\"Luck of the Draw : True-Life Tales of Lottery Winners and Losers\\", Arsenal Pulp Press, 2001. from Vancouver, British Columbia, who had recently moved to Montreal, and was himself unemployed. Murphy found the wallet and gave it back to Lavigueur, with the lottery ticket which he knew was the jackpot winner. When he got to the Lavigueur house, the eldest son, Yve, answered the door and refused to let him in, not understanding what he wanted. Murphy came back a second time to meet the father. The new millionaires were Jean-Guy, Sylvie, Yve and Michel Lavigueur, Jean-Marie Daudelin, and William Murphy, with whom the family agreed to share the jackpot. In 1986, Louise Lavigueur, the only member of the family who did not take part in the purchase of the ticket, sued her father to get a share of the jackpot. Family members Two members of the Lavigueur family are still alive: Yve and Sylvie. Yve published a book in 2000 about the family's story and helped with the production of a 6-episode TV series which was broadcast by SRC, the French-language branch of the CBC, in 2008. Sylvie chose to remain away from public life.

The main character was easily recognizable as a caricature of Jean-Guy Lavigueur. =Movies= From 1986, three Dutch movies (Flodder, Flodder in Amerika, and Flodder 3) were translated into joual in Quebec and given the French titles Les Lavigueur déménagent, Les Lavigueur redéménagent and Les Lavigueur, le retour. However, these comedies had nothing to do with the real- life family or their experiences. Books and TV In 2000, Yve Lavigueur published Les Lavigueur: leur véritable histoire (\\"The Lavigueurs: the real story\\", ) with Éditions St-Martin.

Career Sounds Incorporated formed in early 1961, in Dartford, Kent, and gained a reputation in nearby South London for the fullness of their saxophone-led instrumental sound. In August 1961, after Gene Vincent's band, The Blue Caps, had been denied permission to work in the UK, Sounds Incorporated won the opportunity to back Vincent on his British tour and on recordings in London. This led to further opportunities to back other visiting American artists, including Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Brenda Lee and Sam Cooke. Their only record with Parlophone, \\"Mogambo\\", failed to achieve significant sales. The band then moved to Decca, where they released a trio of singles, the last of which was recorded with producer Joe Meek, again with little success. However, while performing in Hamburg in Germany, they met and befriended the Beatles and in 1963 signed to Brian Epstein's management company, NEMS. In the same year, they appeared as musical guests in the film Live It Up! The band's first two singles on new label Columbia, \\"The Spartans\\" and \\"Spanish Harlem\\", made the UK Singles Chart in 1964. These were the only successes that Sounds Incorporated enjoyed in their home country. That same year they became Cilla Black's backing band, and released their first album called Sounds Incorporated. It contained many stage favourites, but not their recent chart successes. The group's third Columbia single, a version of the \\"William Tell Overture\\", was included and turned out to be their greatest success in Australia, where it reached number 2. The group toured the world as the Beatles' opening act, including the August 1965 concert at New York City's Shea Stadium. Sounds Incorporated's continuing popularity ensured a stream of work, including backing duties at the televised NME awards. In December 1964, NME reported that Sounds Incorporated would appear at the Hammersmith Odeon at the \\"Another Beatles Christmas Show\\". Unusual musical instruments were a feature. The battery-operated Clavioline keyboard (as used by the Tornados) is heard on \\"Keep Movin'\\", but is also heard prominently on their previous disc before Meek, \\"Sounds Like Locomotion\\". Al Holmes played the lead melody on flute throughout \\"The Spartans\\". 1966 was the first year the group released no singles in their home country, although they recorded a second album, again simply titled Sounds Incorporated. This was released on EMI's fledgling Studio 2 label, primarily to show off EMI's mid-1960s advances and developments in stereo recording techniques. Any singles taken off the LP for foreign markets were in that format's standard mono, however, making these unusual items for UK collectors of the group. By 1967 the band's name had been truncated to \\"Sounds Inc\\". The Beatles invited Cameron, Holmes and West to be the saxophone section on their track \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\", from the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. After this guest appearance, Sounds Inc left EMI and released a solitary single on the Polydor label. Titled \\"How Do You Feel\\", it was their first single release to feature vocals. The group began to disintegrate in the late 1960s. Drummer Tony Newman left to work as a session musician and at one stage joined the Jeff Beck Group. He later joined Reid Hudson and James Black to form British/Canadian power trio May Blitz. For the remaining members of Sounds Inc, Cameron's departure for a career in A&R; left a gap, which was filled by Terry Fogg (percussionist and drummer) and Trevor White, the band's first true vocalist. The group soldiered on, moving to and mainly playing in Australia for their final years together. Their act became more middle-of-the-road, exemplified in their final LP, which was released in many territories but not the UK, containing more vocals than instrumentals. Sounds Inc finally broke up in 1971.

(1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 420. His warrior clan was amongst the hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family (the fudai) in the Edo period. His childhood name was Tomojiro (斧次郎). Masatsuna was a polymath and a keen student of whatever information was available at that time concerning the West. Since most printed material was only available in the Dutch language, such studies were commonly called \\"Dutch learning\\" (rangaku).Fleming, William. Book review: Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779–1822\\", Southeast Review of Asian Studies, Annual, 2006. Dutch Japanologist Isaac Titsingh considered Masatsuna to have been his closest friend while he was in Japan, and their correspondence continued after Titsingh last left Dejima for the last time. The oldest surviving letter from Masatsuna to Titsingh dates from 1789;Screech, Timon. (2006). Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779–1822, p. 36. and this letter mentions mutual friends such as Shimazu Shigehide (the father-in-law of the eleventh shōgun, Tokugawa Ienari) and Kuze Hirotami (Nagasaki bugyō or governor of Nagasaki port).Screech, p. 152. Masatsuna and Titsingh shared an interest in numismatics. After Titsingh was reassigned from Japan in 1784, he sent packages of coins from India—Dutch coppers, as well as coins from India, Russia, Turkey, and Africa. Titsingh in turn received Japanese and Chinese coins as gifts. Masatsuna was an author of several treatises on numismatics. He was the first in Japan to circulate a book about non-Japanese coins with impressions taken from actual coins which had been obtained from Western traders. Masatsuna's collection of coins was brought to the UK in the 19th century, and is now in the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum.See Helen Wang, 'How did Kutsuki Masatsuna's coins come to the British Museum?', in Catalogue of the Japanese Coin Collection (pre- Meiji) at the British Museum, with special reference to Kutsuki Masatsuna (British Museum Research Publication 174, 2010).

The reaction proceeds under acidic conditions. The alcohol accepts a hydrogen ion from sulfuric acid to form a water, which then leaves, creating a carbocation. The mesomeric form of the cyanogroup reacts with the carbocation. The carbocation is attacked by a water, which then loses an hydrogen to form the product. The product then undergoes hydrolysis to form the N-substituted thiocarbamate. 1041x1041px The reaction requires the formation of a carbocation and does not work for primary alcohols. Only secondary and tertiary alcohols undergo the Riemschneider reaction.  Uses and Limitations  The Riemschneider thiocarbamate synthesis for aromatic compounds does not work efficiently for ortho-substituted compounds such as ortho-carboxy, ortho-methoxy or ortho-nitro derivative compounds. The reaction is also not as efficient for compounds that are sensitive to concentrated acid, such as thiocyanophenols. The reaction works well for other compounds. Various thiocyanate compounds underwent the Riemschneider synthesis to form thiocarbamates, and all had melting points similar to the predicted value.

It was a conventional single-seater biplane with a monocoque fuselage and staggered single-bay wings of equal span braced with N-struts. Two essentially similar landplane versions were built as the CR-1 and CR-2, which were both eventually converted to seaplanes as the CR-3 in 1923 and CR-4 in 1924. A refined version was developed for the US Army Air Service under the designation R-6. These latter two aircraft featured refined aerodynamics included surface-mounted radiators. Operational history An Army Curtiss R-6, which won the 1922 Pulitzer Trophy with an average speed of 330 km/h. The Curtiss CRs enjoyed successful racing careers. Their first major win was at the 1921 Pulitzer Trophy race, where piloted by Bert Acosta the CR-1 took first place with an average speed of 176.75 mph (283.49 km/h), nearly two minutes ahead of its closest rival. The following year, this aircraft was modified and redesignated CR-2 and joined in the Pulitzer race by a second aircraft built to the same new standard, plus two R-6s flown by Army pilots. These Curtiss aircraft took first through fourth place, the two R-6s followed by the two CR-2s. The race was won by Lt. Russell Maughan with an average speed of 205.856 mph (330,172 km/h) with Lt. Lester Maitland in second place (198.850 mph/318.936 km/h). Maughan's effort incidentally broke every closed-circuit airspeed record up to 124 mi (200 km). The CR-2s took third and fourth places piloted by Lt Harold Brow (average speed 193.695 mph/310.667 km/h) and Lt Jg Al Williams (average speed 187.996 mph/301.527 km/h). The Army built upon this success with the R-6s by using the aircraft to break the world airspeed record before 1922 was over, Gen Billy Mitchell flying one to 224.28 mph (359.72 km/h) on 18 October. In March the following year, an R-6 flown by Lt. Maughan lifted the record to 236.587 mph (380.74 km/h). The R-6 design was developed in 1923 into the longer-winged XPW-8, the prototype of the PW-8 fighter. In 1923, the CR-2s were fitted with floats for the Schneider Trophy race and redesignated CR-3. The aircraft took first and second place, piloted by David Rittenhouse (average speed and Rutledge Irvine . After the 1924 Schneider Trophy race was cancelled, CR-3 A6081 was flown by Lt. G.T. Cuuddihy to set up new World's closed-course seaplane record oc . A6081 was further modified as the CR-4 for use as a test-bed and trainer for the 1926 Schneider Trophy racing team. Variants ;CR-1: the first CR with US Navy serial A6081, with Lamblin radiators between the undercarriage struts. ;CR-2: the second CR A6081, fitted with streamlined wheels and wing surface radiators. ;CR-3: both A6080 and A6081 were converted to CR-3 standard with floats and Curtis D-12 5PL engines. ;CR-4: CR-3 A6081, modified as a test-bed and trainer for the 1926 Schneider Trophy race team.

Development Built for the United States Army with the designation VZ-5, this prototype was one of a series of experimental aircraft designed to investigate various aspects and solutions for VTOL aircraft. The VZ-5 was an all-metal high-wing monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage. The fuselage had an open cockpit for one pilot and a rear-mounted high-tailplane. The unusual aspect of the aircraft was that it had one General Electric turboshaft in the rear fuselage driving four propellers, two each mounted in nacelles on the leading edge of each wing. It also had two small four-bladed tail-rotors mounted above the tailplane for control. The wing had conventional trailing edge flaps and ailerons but it also had a section of the wing that could be deflected to act as a full-span flap. For a vertical takeoff two- thirds of the wing chord acted as a flap in the slipstream of the four propellers. The VZ-5 was first flown tethered on 18 November 1959 but only had limited testing before the project was abandoned.

Early life Mackintosh was the son of Captain Duncan Mackintosh, an officer in a Highland regiment. He had a spiritual experience at age 18 through the letters of his sister and reading John Nelson Darby's Operations of the Spirit. In 1838, he went to work in a business house in Limerick, Ireland. The following year, he went to Dublin and identified himself with the Plymouth Brethren. About 1874, Mackintosh reflecting on his course wrote, \\"I had not the honour of being among the first of those who planted their feet on the blessed ground occupied by Brethren. I left the Establishment about the year 1839, and took my place at the table in Dublin, where dear Bellett was ministering with great acceptance ... As a young man I, of course, walked in retirement, having no thought of coming forward in public ministry of any kind ... Indeed, I may say that nothing but the most solemn sense of responsibility could ever have induced me to stand up in public.\\" In 1843, Mackintosh wrote his first tract entitled Peace with God. When he was 24, he opened a private school at Westport, County Mayo where he developed a special method of teaching classical languages. This was during the Great Famine of 1845–50, and Mackintosh went around County Mayo preaching the gospel to the poor during school holidays. The effort required to run a boarding school in such a poor and famine-hit district caused Mackintosh to abandon the enterprise in 1853; he told John Nelson Darby that nothing could induce him to go on with a boarding school. He tried farming for a time, but he wrote to Darby on 31 August 1853 that the Lord had \\"called me into larger service than ever\\", and he soon concluded that he must give himself entirely to preaching, writing, and public speaking. Author and evangelist Soon after this he established a periodical named Things New and Old, which he continued to edit (with evangelist Charles Stanley, 1821–1890) from 1858 to 1890, and Good News for the Little Ones, later called Good News for Young and Old and some pages for the Little Ones from 1859 to 1876. Mackintosh took a great interest in, and actively participated in, the great Irish Evangelical revival of 1859 and 1860 (see Revivalism). Mackintosh's literary fame rests primarily upon his work Notes on the Pentateuch, beginning with a volume of 334 pages on Genesis, and concluding with a two-volume work on Deuteronomy extending to over 800 pages. These are still in print and have been translated into a dozen or more languages. Brethren historian Roy Coad notes: \\"Another popular writer among the exclusives was an Irish schoolmaster, Charles Henry Mackintosh, who preached extensively in the revival movement. The initials 'C.H.M.' became familiar in many pious evangelical households of the later Victorian and Edwardian years. No critical scholar, Mackintosh nevertheless had a marked gift for simple Biblical exposition, and his works on the Pentateuch had an enormous vogue as simple aids to devotional interpretation for the first five books of the Bible. He was, however, no theologian, and certain isolated sentences in those books referred to 'the heavenly humanity' of Christ (and thus verged on formal heresy), brought him much hostile notice from prejudiced opponents of the Brethren (who took his writings as being far more significant and representative than they deserved). He later withdrew the expressions, on Darby's insistence.\\"F. Roy Coad, A History of the Brethren Movement (Vancouver: Regent College Publishing, 1968), page 208. Arno C. Gaebelein says of Mackintosh, along with other Brethren writers, \\"I found in [these] writings... the soul food I needed. I esteem these men next to the Apostles in their sound and spiritual teachings.\\" Charles Spurgeon, who crossed swords with early Plymouth Brethren on their ideas of ministry, offers the following comment on C.H. Mackintosh's Notes on Leviticus: \\"We do not endorse Plymouthism which pervades these notes, but they are frequently suggestive. Should be read cautiously.\\"C.H. Spurgeon, Lectures to My Students (Edinburgh: First Banner of Truth edition, 2008), page 729. On his Notes on Genesis, however, Spurgeon complimented their 'precious and edifying reflections'. Dwight L. Moody offered a view which overall was much more positive than Spurgeon, writing: \\"I had my attention called to C.H.M.'s notes, and was so much pleased and at the same time profited by the way they opened up the Scripture truth, that I secured at once all the writings of the same author, and if they could not be replaced, [I] would rather part with my entire library, excepting my Bible, than with these writings. They have been to me a very key to the Scriptures.\\" He summarised the value to him of Mackintosh's writings, testifying that '...Mackintosh had the greatest influence on me.\\" Closing days Charles Andrew Coates wrote, \\"I was one of the last persons to hear C.H.M. pray. It was most touching to hear the aged and feeble Levite pouring out his heart to God, first for the whole assembly, and then for the little companies gathered everywhere to the Lord's Name. The Lord's interests were the great burden of his heart. Though he had been for a length of time incapacitated for any public service he was still keeping the charge.\\" Mackintosh died on 2 November 1896 shortly after entering his 76th year, following increasing weakness in which he had no energy left to preach, though he had continued to write until even that was impossible. Eventually this also ceased, but his literature continued to be published. The 6th edition of Notes on the Book of Genesis was published before the year ended. Four days later on 6 November 1896 he was buried in Cheltenham Cemetery. He was buried by the side of his wife in what is known as \\"the Plymouth Brethren plot\\", just in front of the grave of one of his converts, the hymn writer G.W. Frazer who had died in the previous January and where other prominent Plymouth Brethren of the day were buried. Dr. Walter Wolston of Edinburgh preached from Genesis 25:8–10 and Hebrews 11:8–10 at the funeral and the mourners sang J.N. Darby's hymn: O bright and blessèd scenes, Where sin can never come; Whose sight our longing spirit weans From earth, where yet we roam. Photograph of Gravestone The American author of a brief obituary remarked that he would not allow his \\"thoughts to indulge in fulsome praise (of men) – rather to recognise the grace of God vouchsafed to His servant.\\" An Australian magazine The Message published this in its pages, \\"Now to tell of our beloved and honoured brother Mr Mackintosh's departure to be with Christ. He had been in failing health for twelve months, but continued the Handfuls of Pasture monthly as before – most sweet, profitable teaching. Mr Mackintosh's breathing greatly distressed him, and for some time he was not equal to going to the Meetings, or even to leaving the house, but did not take to his bed. I went as often as I could to see him. When inquiring how he was, the answer ever was – 'Just as I ought to be.' God's way was always best to him. Just six months before his own departure to be with Christ – J B Stoney, in declining health at Scarborough, said of CHM, 'He is now where love is satisfied.'\\" The Scripture texts on the gravestone of Mackintosh and his wife Emma are \\"Feed the flock of God\\" (1 Peter 5:2) and \\"He being dead yet speaketh\\" (Hebrews 11:4). Beneath Emma's inscription is Darby's verse, Jesus, we wait for Thee, With Thee to have our part; What can full joy and blessing be But being where Thou art?

It was built at the same time as the NS Class 1100 at Alsthom and was based on the SNCF Class CC 7100. The Class 1300 is a bigger 6-axle, Co′Co′, version of the Class 1100. The first loco, the 1301, was delivered in 1952 and was first used at the opening of the electric service between Zwolle and Groningen. After being in service for less than a year 1303 was damaged beyond repair when it collided with EMU 642 at Weesp on June 19, 1953. After this accident Alsthom delivered a new loco that was originally to be delivered as a CC 7100 to the SNCF. 1303 was scrapped on the spot although some equipment was salvaged to be used in replacement loco 1311. The locos numbered 1312-1316 were delivered in 1956 in a Berlin blue colour scheme (the locos delivered in 1952 were delivered in a turquoise colour scheme, but were painted Berlin blue in 1955). During the 1980s the entire Class 1300 got prolonging maintenance and were painted yellow, with a big NS logo at the side. Also, the locos were all named after a Dutch city: * 1301 Dieren * 1302 Woerden * 1304 Culemborg * 1305 Alphen aan den Rijn * 1306 Brummen * 1307 Etten-Leur * 1308 Nunspeet * 1309 Susteren * 1310 Bussum * 1311 Best * 1312 Zoetermeer * 1313 Uitgeest * 1314 Hoorn * 1315 Tiel * 1316 Geldermalsen In 2000 the last locomotives were withdrawn from service. 1302, 1304, 1312 and 1315 have been preserved. In 2015 number 1304 came back into service for private operator HSL Logistik, but in February 2016 it brake down due to operator error. Late 2018 it was repaired by replacing a few traction motors and since then it is deployed by the Fairtrains foundation for occasional transfers.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 9, 2011 south- flowing stream in western Marin County, California, United States which empties into Bolinas Lagoon. Course The creek parallels State Route 1. Copper Mine Gulch enters from the east, then McCormick Creek enters from the west at Pablo Point. After crossing under Olema-Bolinas Road, it feeds into the west side of Bolinas Lagoon just north of the town of Bolinas. History Pine Gulch Creek was used for generations by the Coastal Miwok Native American tribe that inhabited the areas of western Marin County for hundreds of years. Artifacts of the tribe can still be found along Pine Gulch Creek. The Creek was home to many fish species such as Rainbow Trout and Coho Salmon, but these species disappeared mostly from the waterway after irrigation from the Creek lowered water levels. A small comeback was made by these species in 2001 and their populations have continued to grow. This is partially thanks to a campaign from the Marin County Resource Conservation District, to limit the amount of water drawn from the Creek, thus raising water levels to a safer level to foster fish life in the waterway. Local farmers have undertaken this initiative by constructing a series of ponds to irrigate their fields instead of using Pine Gulch Creek as a source of water. Habitat and human influences Pine Gulch Creek once supported both steelhead trout and Coho salmon. The salmon run, made vulnerable by overfishing, disappeared after 1968, but reappeared in 2001 and since the population has been steadily growing, helped by new restrictions on water use from the creek. Many farmers in area have switched to using rain filled ponds to irrigate their crops, helping fish populations to rise in the waterway. The most notable of these farmers include, Dennis and Sandy Dierks of Paradise Valley Produce, Peter Martinelli of Fresh Run Farm and Warren Webber of Star Route Farms. Bridges The only notable crossing of Pine Gulch Creek is the concrete slab at the Olema-Bolinas Road crossing, located 1.3 miles south of State Route 1. It was built in 1986.

Early life and education Born and raised in Cicero, Illinois, Tyra was the only child of first-generation Polish-American parents who were employed by Western Electric's nearby Hawthorne Works. He graduated from Morton High School in Cicero (Diploma 1951), Northwestern University (BSM 1954, GBSM 1955, Music Education/Composition) and the United States Navy School of Music (1956) where he would refine his composition and arranging skills while fulfilling his military service obligations. In 1971, Tyra earned his Ph.D in Music Education from the University of Michigan under the auspices of Allen Britton, Emil Holz, and long-time Director of Bands, William Revelli.Tyra, Thomas Norman (1971). The Analyses of Three Twentieth-Century Compositions for Wind Ensemble. Ph.D (Music) Dissertation, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. In this document, Tyra analyzes Symphonies of Wind Instruments (Stravinsky), Octandre (Varèse), and Pittsburg Overture (Penderecki). Bandmaster, music educator and mentor Following graduation from Northwestern in 1955, Tyra began his career as a high school band director in Des Moines, Iowa. The following year, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was ordered to Washington, DC, where he fulfilled his military service obligations as a staff arranger and rehearsal conductor at the Navy School of Music. Upon his honorable discharge in late 1957 - followed by a brief teaching assignment at Morton College in his hometown of Cicero - Tyra joined the Louisiana State University faculty in the Fall of 1958, serving as an assistant to the Director of Bands L. Bruce Jones. In 1959, LSU elevated Tyra to the position of 14th Bandmaster of the Tiger Marching Band, making him - at age 26 - the nation's youngest director of a major university marching band. That same year Tyra created the LSU Ballet Corps dance line, launching what would in 1965, become the LSU Golden Girls. Satisfying the constant demand for new musical content on the LSU gridiron was a small cadre of aspiring student composers and arrangers which included Bill Conti. Conti would later gain fame by penning Gonna Fly Now, the theme song popularized by the 1976 hit film Rocky. During his tenure, Tyra introduced Hey, Fightin' Tigers, an adaptation of Hey, Look Me Over from the 1960 musical Wildcat! by Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh. This team spirit song - later adopted by the LSU Golden Girls as their introductory theme - continues to be used at LSU athletic events today. In 1964, Tyra was appointed Director of Bands at Eastern Michigan University. In 1968, a young Max Plank joined the EMU Bands Program as Tyra's assistant. Together they forged a lifelong collaboration and friendship that would result in significant growth of the EMU's band program and its traditions. In 2002, Plank passed the leadership mantle to Scott Boerma, ending an era that spanned over 38 years of EMU Band history. After leaving EMU in 1977 and until 1985, Tyra headed the Department of Music at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, strengthening its Music Education curriculum and planting the seeds of growth for its instrumental performance programs, including marching band. From 1985 until his retirement in 1989, he served as Professor and Dean of the Crane School of Music at SUNY-Potsdam.Crane School of Music Overview He also held appointments as Director of the Ann Arbor Civic BandAnn Arbor Civic Band (late 1960s to 1977) and guest Clinician at the Ontario Youth Music Camp in Beaverton, Ontario, Canada (1970–73).

Composer, arranger and lyricist Tyra wrote numerous original compositions, arrangements, and lyrics for works performed by wind ensembles, marching bands, military bands, and brass ensembles of all levels. For beginning bands, Tyra wrote a series of compositions that he (whimsically) titled Wholey Hymn, Modal March, Pentatonic Polka, Quartal Caper, and Polytonal Parade. Compositions and arrangements for intermediate bands include Two 17th Century Italian Songs and arrangements of Handel's The Messiah (Part I) Tyra, Thomas Norman (1955). The Messiah (Part I).

Never published, it is now part of the Music Department archives at Eastern Michigan University. For more skilled ensembles, he penned many arrangements of pre- game and half-time music for the Northwestern, LSU and EMU Marching Bands, including nationally televised works performed by the Tiger Marching Band when LSU competed post-season at the Sugar Bowl (1959, 1960), the Orange Bowl (1962), the Cotton Bowl Classic (1963) and the Bluebonnet Bowl (1964).LSU Football post-season appearances His original compositions include Suite for Brass and Timpani, Three Christmas Miniatures, Ceremonial Sketch and Intravention. For Eastern Michigan University, Tyra composed Eastern Variants, the music and lyrics for Go Green!, The Pride of the Peninsula, Huron War Cry, EMU Fanfare and the break strain for the Huron (now Eagle) . These compositions - integral to modern EMU band tradition - reflect the expertise he developed in writing for low brass voices while serving at the U.S. Navy School of Music.

After kidnapping the visiting Gwen Stacy from a camp in the Savage Land, Kraven and Gog battle the heroes Ka-Zar and Spider- Man. While Ka-Zar deals with Kraven, Spider-Man defeats Gog by luring him into a patch of quicksand, which he sinks to the bottom of. Gog would later be saved from dying in the quicksand by the Plunderer. Having Gog (who created a device that allowed him to speak English) act as his servant, the Plunderer uses him in a plot to try to steal the super soldier serum in New York City. Followed to New York by Ka-Zar, Gog and the Plunderer battle him before Gog, using his teleportation bracelets, escapes, first to the Statue of Liberty, then the World Trade Center and finally, to another dimension. Gog is later found in the dimension he escaped to by Doctor Octopus and the Sinister Six, who induct the creature into their group as the sixth and final member of it. Aiding the Sinister Six fight a multitude of heroes, Gog is beaten in combat by the hero Solo and shrunken by Mister Fantastic, who sends him back to the dimension the Sinister Six found him in. Gog later appeared on Monster Isle when Shadowcat and Magik appeared to look for a mutant girl named Bo. Gog was among the monsters that attacked the three until Magik teleported herself, Shadowcat, and Bo to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 3 #33 =Return= Gog reappeared in The Amazing Spider-Man under writer Nick Spencer detailing his new origin as a alien pet and voyage to Earth as Kraven's bodyguard. https://www.cbr.com/amazing-spider-man-gog-tragic-origin/ Powers and abilities Gog possesses superhuman strength.

Based on the President's message from 2015, there are approximately 5,000 members.  History  = Founding = Sons of the Revolution was founded on February 22, 1876, at New York City, primarily by leading members of The Society of the Cincinnati and the businessman John Austin Stevens. He disagreed with Society of the Cincinnati requirements limiting membership to the eldest male descendants based on the rules of primogeniture. Stevens held a preliminary meeting on December 18, 1875, at the New-York Historical Society at New York. At a second meeting held in January 1876, the first constitution was adopted and a flier which invited members was published. After a few years of little activity, an elaborate \\"turtle feast\\" was held on December 4, 1883, in the Long Room of historic Fraunces Tavern. The banquet was to commemorate the centennial of General George Washington's farewell there to his officers. The 1883 dinner helped recruit 40 new members, and the group was reorganized as the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York Inc. In the early years after the reorganization, Society of the Cincinnati President-General Hamilton Fish gave much support and encouragement to the New York Society. In his obituary, he described Sons members as, \\"Younger brothers of the Cincinnati\\". = Formation of state societies = Besides residents of New York City, many gentlemen from nearby states with business or other ties in New York City had, from the beginning, been either members or prospective members of the Society. The possibility that some of them might eventually form societies in their own states had been recognized in the Society Constitution. The growth in the number of members by 1888 made this a more promising likelihood. The first of the new State Societies, the Pennsylvania Society of Sons of the Revolution was organized on April 3, 1888. This was accomplished chiefly through the efforts of John W. Jordan, later librarian of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania and Josiah Granville Leach. The creation of a new State Society in Pennsylvania started a debate over the Society Constitution. Of primary concern was who would charter or create new State Societies. The Pennsylvania Society was created by members; independent of the New York Society. On March 11, 1889, The Sons of the Revolution in the District of Columbia was chartered by the New York Society. This debate was resolved by the creation of the General Society and a new Constitution on April 18, 1890. The General Society charters new societies but, \\"The State Societies shall regulate all matters respecting their own affairs\\". = General society formation = The Sons of the Revolution plaque in Washington DC. Recognizing that members from states other than New York might form state societies in their states, the group's officers amended its constitution in 1884 to provide that state societies may organize as \\"auxiliary branches.\\" Consequently, the Pennsylvania society was formed in 1888, and the District of Columbia society was formed in 1889. The General Society constitution was proposed on February 12, 1890, in Philadelphia and adopted on March 8, 1890, in New York. Members of the three state societies held a meeting on April 19, 1890, in Washington to inaugurate the General Society. In the next few years, several more state societies were formed and the General Society developed a more national character.  Activities  The General Society and state societies offer patriotic, historical and educational activities for its members and the public. In addition to various dinners, exhibits and holiday events, the societies produce the following specific activities. Several state societies own and operate historic buildings. = Triennial general meetings = Since its founding, the General Society has held triennial meetings of the membership. The 41st meeting was held on October 4 through 7, 2012 in Savannah, Georgia, by the Georgia society. The 42nd meeting was held on October 1 through 4, 2015, in Williamsburg, Virginia, by the Virginia Society. = Citizen awards = The General Society has established various citizen awards, given to individuals and state societies for their work to continue the SR mission and honor the memory of the participants of the Revolution. The awards include the Modern Patriot Award, the Patrick Henry Award, the Jay Harris Award, the Richard Farmer Hess Leadership Award, the Trent Trophy, the Membership Achievement Award and the Presidential Commendation of Merit. = Fraunces Tavern = Fraunces Tavern at the southeast corner on Pearl Street at Broad Street at lower Manhattan in New York Since 1904, the New York Society has owned and operated the Fraunces Tavern as a museum and restaurant. They restored the building, which had a prominent place in pre-Revolution and Revolution history. The society claims the tavern is Manhattan's oldest surviving building. The Fraunces Tavern Museum maintains several galleries of art and artifacts about the Revolution, including the McEntee \\"Sons of the Revolution\\" Gallery that displays much of the Society history.The building served also as the offices of the General Society until 2002, In 2013, the society headquarters was relocated to Williamsburg, Virginia. = Green End Fort = The Rhode Island society has maintained Green End Fort, in the Village of Green's End on the border of Newport and Middletown, since 1969 when its owner, Newport Historical Society, \\"expressed hope that the Sons would 'maintain the Fort as a memorial and eventually acquire the property.'\\" The fort was believed to have been built in 1777 by British troops as part of the defenses of Newport, but more recent scholarship indicates it was probably built by the French army under Comte de Rochambeau in 1780. = Grave-marker and wreath placements = Samuel Adams grave marker with Sons of the Revolution notation in the Granary Burying Ground at Boston Several state societies have placed Society markers and wreaths at the graves of identified revolutionary patriots; for instance, the Massachusetts society placed markers at the graves of Samuel Adams and James Otis Jr., which are located in the Granary Burying Ground at Boston. The General Society joined the Georgia society in 2005 to place a wreath at the re-interment of U.S. Brig. Gen. Casimir Pulaski in Savannah, Ga. = \\"Let Freedom Ring\\" celebrations = Since July 4, 1969, the Pennsylvania society has sponsored \\"Let Freedom Ring,\\" the nationwide celebration of those who helped achieve the nation's independence during the Revolution. According to U.S. Senate Concurrent Resolution 25 of 1963, bells across the nation are rung 13 times at exactly 2:00 p.m. EDT in honor of the 13 original states represented by the signers of the Declaration of Independence. At the appointed hour, four young descendants of the signers tap Philadelphia's famous Liberty Bell, setting off the chimes of freedom from bell towers throughout the nation. A series of related patriotic festivities take place in the Independence Hall area, including a colorful parade of Revolutionary War flags, fifes and drums, and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the Revolutionary War at Washington Square. = Military awards = The General Society and several State Societies have established various educational and military awards, which are given to individuals and groups for their academic or service performance. The awards include the Annapolis Cup, which was created in 1905 and given annually by the general society and the Maryland society to a U.S. Naval Academy midshipman; the Knox Trophy (New York), which was created in 1910 and given annually by the New York society to a U.S. Military Academy at West Point cadet; the Capt. Gustavus Conyngham Award which was created in 1999 and given annually by the New York society to a U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point midshipman; the Recognition Award, which was created in 2002 and given annually by the Massachusetts society to a U.S. Army ROTC cadet; and the Knox Trophy (Massachusetts), which was created in 1924 and given annually until 1940 by the Massachusetts society to a U.S. Army field-artillery battery and a \\"redleg\\" artilleryman. = Evacuation Day observances = The New York society has organized infrequent Evacuation Day observances of the anniversary of the British departure on November 25, 1783, from New York after the Revolution. After a controversial New York Police Department denial on May 21, 2008, of a New York society application for a parade permit, officials accepted the application on July 30, 2008, for society members to march down Broadway from New York City Hall to Battery Park, \\"where reenactors in period costumes will lower a Union Jack and raise the Stars and Stripes in a symbolic reprise of what happened in 1783. British and French diplomats, along with others who had roles in the American colonies' struggle for independence,\\" were invited to attend.  Partial list of notable members  President Harry S.

History MV Ali Cat was built in 2000 for Solent & Wightline Cruises, who chartered her to Blue Funnel Group. They in turn chartered her to Caledonian MacBrayne for the Dunoon to Gourock service. She entered service on 21 October 2002 to run at peak times, carrying up to 250 passengers. The run had previously been served at peak times by two car ferries, one of which went down the Firth of Clyde at quieter times to assist on the Rothesay to Wemyss Bay service which only had a 90-minute service at peak times. Introduction of the Ali Cat for the winter 2002-03 timetable met morning and evening commuter demand on the Dunoon run, releasing the peak period car ferry to improve the Rothesay service. At first the catamaran had occasional difficulties with winter weather making embarking at Dunoon hazardous and leading to cancellations. The service was subsequently extended to cover summer timetables, and construction of a breakwater in 2004 overcame the problems at Dunoon pier. From 30 June 2011, the Dunoon to Gourock crossing became a passenger-only service operated by Argyll Ferries Ltd (a sister company to Caledonian MacBrayne).
