It is named after the national hero of Abrskil -- a parallel folk hero of the Greek Prometheus and Georgian Amiran -- known as Abkhaz Prometheus. It is also called the Otap cave. Abrskila is more than 2 km in length out of which about 1.5 to 1.7 km is accessible for viewing. Its beauty and fame is compared favourably with another cave known as the New Athos Cave. Geography Abrskil Cave is located in the picturesque southern slopes of the Panavi ridge near the port of Ochamchire, in karstic limestone. The cave is about 2 km long (3 km length including passages has also been reported), out of which 1.5 to 1.7 km has been made accessible. The cave has a winding gallery from where Achkitzgo River is seen to emerge. This gallery has six chambers, out of which the main hall is studded with naturally developed, elegantly formed stalactites, stalagmites, helicites, columns, curtains and so forth, formed in karstic limestone formations. These halls have been illuminated by lights to make them look attractive and the most impressive hall is called the Heliktitův Hall. The access entrance to the cave has watch towers known as Abkhazian Wall, where a water fall is also seen. It is the second longest cave in Abkhazia. During the visit of President Sergey Bagapsh on 6 June 2010 to the village of Otap and the Abrskil Cave with Member of Parliament Zaur Adleiba and the Ochamchira district governor Murman Dzhopua and pledged to provide the assistance needed to restore a tourist route to Abrskil cave. The villagers of Otap rely heavily on tourists visiting this cave for their livelihoods and selling locally produced farm goods to them. The Abkhaz state-owned company, Chernomorenergo, has been responsible for providing the cave with electricity to light up the tunnels and attract more tourists to fuel the local economy. The cave has been developed with improved infrastructure facilities to encourage tourism to the place. Legend The legend that is directly linked to the Abrskil Cave is that of Abraskil, the folk hero of Abkhazian. According to the popular folk legend of Abkhazian, Abraskil is the name of the legendary boy born out of wedlock to a lovely girl called Abkhazia. He grew up in wild and wayward ways. He was unlike other boys and grew up into a very strong, handsome person with huge ambitions. He could ride on a horse and hurl large stones while riding on it. His favourite horse was called Arasch. His bravery and daring was a kind of Robin Hood image for his friends and compatriots. He challenged God that he was as good as Him and that he could perform any act which God could do. He moved between the mountains and the sea with great aplomb and abandon; he was kind of invincible in his movements on his magic horse Arasch. He had a following of compatriots. However, God told Abrskil to give up his cruel killing of people and destruction of forest land. He was asked to submit himself before God for punishment. Since Abrskil was very proud and brave he refused and God became furious and directed His angels to capture Abrskil as prisoner to met out suitable punishment. The apostles of god, called as afehambres, were appointed by god to catch Abraskil. Abraskil used a handy tool called alabasha (kind of a bludgeon) to negotiate from place to place between the mountain and the sea, performing a Tarzan act, making it difficult for the apostles or angels to catch him. The apostles then hatched a plan to catch him by spreading slippery cow skins near the sea. As Abraskil jumped with his horse Arasch from the mountain to the sea shore, his horse slipped and he fell and was hurt. He was immediately caught by the angles. He made every effort to escape but woodpeckers help was sought to break his alabasha to prevent him from escaping. As he fell from his horse towards the shores of the Black Sea, his alabasha also broke and he was caught within the cow skin near the sea. He could not escape. He was then tied up and brought to a cave in a nearby hill, close to the Otap village. There, he was chained to a pillar in the cave and his horse was also tied to a nearby post. For seven days and nights he tried in vain to break loose from the post. As he was making these efforts to get free, a bird – boloqanqara – sat on the pillar. Abraskil was furious and he struck at the bird with the hammer. As his bad luck would have it, the hammer got firmly stuck in the pillar and the bird flew away. He and his horse could not escape. He was imprisoned in the cave. The cave where he and his horse were tied up is now famous and is called the achuats tizgo (which means the place of horse’s dung). While his friends, particularly Djmlot, tried to get him freed, the fair skinned blue eyed people of the village exulted at his plight in the cave. He could not escape from the cave.

Prior to her Navy service, she operated as a transport and supply vessel during the Second Seminole War. Though only an auxiliary ship, General Taylor appears to have had quite a colorful career. After her Seminole War service, she played a cameo role in the notorious trial and sentencing of abolitionist Jonathan Walker. In the mid-1840s, General Taylors crew included two future Engineers-in-Chief of the Navy. After being burned and rebuilt in 1846, the steamer later played a role in the foiling of a planned 1849 filibuster invasion of Cuba. General Taylor was sold by the Navy in 1852. Design and construction General Taylor had a length of , a beam of , a draft of and a hold depth of .\\"General Taylor\\", Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. General Taylors original builder is not known, but her original engine was supplied by the Allaire Iron Works of New York.Emmons, pp. 30-31. The single-cylinder, 98 hp, 23 rpm engine was of the square crosshead type, with a 25.3 inch bore and 6-foot stroke. Steam was supplied by an iron flue boiler at an average working pressure of 20 psi. The paddlewheels were 16 feet in diameter and 4 feet 10 inches wide, with fourteen 1-foot 10-inch width paddles. The vessel had an average speed of 8 and a maximum speed of 9 knots.Emmons, pp. 34-35. Service history General Taylor was purchased at New York by the War Department in 1840 and was used as a transport and supply ship during the Second Seminole War in Florida. She was transferred to the Navy in 1842, and used for a time in the Gulf of Mexico. In July 1844, General Taylor was used to convey abolitionist Jonathan Walker from Key West to the Pensacola Navy Yard, where he was handed over to local authorities and charged with slave stealing. Walker later testified that for most of the voyage aboard General Taylor, in spite of being seriously ill, he was kept chained hand and foot in \\"filthy\\"Chapman, p. 191. and oppressively hot conditions in or near the engine room of the steamer's hold,Chapman, p. 219. apart from brief periods of a few hours a day when he was allowed on deck. Walker was later infamously sentenced by a Florida civil court to having the letters \\"S.S.\\"--an acronym for \\"Slave Stealer\\"Burnett, p. 141.--branded on his hand.Chapman, p. 206. In 1845, General Taylor was converted into a tugboat, operating out of the Pensacola Navy Yard. Benjamin F. Isherwood, later Engineer-in-Chief of the Navy during the American Civil War, served on General Taylor in 1846-47.Hamersly, p. 227. William H. Shock, Engineer-in- Chief of the Navy in the 1870s, also served on General Taylor in the late 1840s.Hamersly, p. 328. On 10 October 1846, General Taylor caught fire while lying at the wharf of the Pensacola Navy Yard, and was burned to the water's edge.Dixon, p. 472. She was redesigned by F. Grice and rebuilt by G. Lyndal of Baltimore, a new engine and boiler being supplied at the same time by Charles Reeder & Sons of the same city. The new 187 hp engine was of the crosshead type, with a 36-inch bore, 6-foot stroke and steam cut-off of 3 feet. The new boiler had a greater fire surface area (720 vs. 499 square feet) than the original, and a slightly higher operating pressure of 25 psi. The paddlewheel diameter was also enlarged by a foot, and the number of paddles reduced by one to thirteen. The new machinery appears to have been less efficient than the original, consuming twice the fuel for only a one-half knot increase in maximum speed. General Taylors hull dimensions remained the same after the rebuild as before. In September 1849, General Taylor was despatched to Round Island, Mississippi, to help monitor a party of 500 or more \\"adventurers\\" gathered there, whose leaders were rumored to be planning an attack on Cuba. General Taylor was selected for the mission because her light draft was expected to enable her to negotiate the shallow approaches to the Island, while her speed would allow her to effectively pursue any ships attempting to embark the adventurers.Message of the President, p. 80. For the operation, General Taylor was equipped with a single 6-pounder cannon, and her crew issued with small arms. In the event, these precautions proved unnecessary as the men on the island eventually dispersed peacefully. The men had been in the pay of Narciso López, a Venezuelan filibuster. Lopez would later organize two further attempts to invade Cuba; on the last attempt he was captured and executed by the Spanish. General Taylor was employed as a dispatch vessel at the Navy Yard until April 1852, when, needing extensive repairs, she was sold at public auction at Pensacola for $3,000. Her fate thereafter is unknown. References Bibliography * Burnett, Gene (1996): Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State, Volume 1, p. 141, Pineapple Press, . * Dixon, Joan M.

Saint Louis dedicated his life to following and praying to the Virgin Mary. His devotion to Mary was even considered “the best and most acceptable form of devotion to Our Lady” by Pope Pius IX.St. Louis de Montfort, True Devotion to Mary (Rockford, Illinois: Tan Books and Publishers, Inc., 1941) p. v Four of his performed miracles were examined by the Sacred Congregation. Saint Louis de Montfort was canonized by Pope Pius XII on July 20, 1947, over two hundred years after his death. The process took a very long time due to his lack of followers and the unfortunate era in which he died. His two biographies, one by Grandet and the other Father de Clorivière, both dated in the 1700s, which was a time of “immense social and religious upheaval.”Jesus Living in Mary: Handbook of the Spirituality of St. Louis de Montfort (Litchfield, CT: Montfort Publications, 1994) http://www.ewtn.com/library/Montfort/Handbook/Canonize.htm Background Information Saint Louis de Montfort found it his life’s mission to be devoted to Mary. He believed that in order to thoroughly follow Jesus, one had to go through Mary first. The process of total consecration to Jesus through Mary came to light. Preparation for Total Consecration according to Saint Louis Marie de Montfort was published by Montfort Publications in Bay Shore, New York, in 2001. Consecration Process The purpose of the consecration is to rid the self of the spirit of the world and to become completely in tune with the lives of Jesus and the Mother Mary. This particular consecration is a thirty-three-day-long process in which the final day falls on a feast day of the Blessed Virgin. =Part I: Twelve Preliminary Days= The first twelve days of the consecration are set aside as the preliminary days, meant to rid one’s self of all outside hindrances. Saint Louis de Montfort declares that this “part of the preparation should be employed in casting off the spirit of the world which is contrary to that of Jesus Christ.”Preparation for Total Consecration According to Saint Louis Marie de Monfort, (Bay Shore, New York: Montfort Publications, 1996) p. 1 After a short introduction to the preliminary days is given, Saint Louis provides a list of three prayers that should be said daily. These prayers include Veni Creator, Avi Maris Stella, and the Magnificat. Each day also entails a short meditation meant to be reflected upon before the prayers. The daily meditations tend to include one or two bible verses accompanied with a couple reflective words from the saint himself. =Part II: Knowledge of Self= After the twelve days are completed, the consecration moves on to Part II: Knowledge of Self. In this section, Saint Louis de Montfort’s goal for the consecrator is to “consider not so much the opposition that exists between the spirit of Jesus and ours, as the miserable and humiliating state to which our sins have reduced us.”Preparation for Total…, p. 21 The prayers for this period are a bit longer, consisting of the Litany of the Holy Ghost, Litany of the Blessed Virgin, and the Ave Maris Stella. =Part III: Knowledge of Mary= Once the Knowledge of Self week is complete, the next section of the consecration to be prayed is Part III: Knowledge of Mary. During this period, it is important to reflect upon “the interior life of Mary, namely, her virtues, her sentiments, her actions, her participation in the mysteries of Christ and her union with Him.”Preparation for Total…, p. 38 The prayers said for this section include the same as the previous. However, the consecrator is to say a daily rosary amid everything else. This week is a more challenging part for consecrators, as it leads to an hour to two hours of prayer and reflection. =Part IV: Knowledge of Jesus Christ= The fourthand final part of Saint Louis de Montfort’s consecration is the Knowledge of Jesus Christ. The prayers for this section include Litany of the Holy Ghost, Ave Maris Stella, Litany of the Holy Name of Jesus, St. Louis de Montfort’s Prayer to Jesus, and O, Jesus Living in Mary. At the finish of the consecration, usually the consecrator is to purchase a chain that can be worn around the wrist as a constant reminder of one’s slave hood to Mary and Jesus. In order for the consecration to be complete, the consecrator must attend Mass on the final day, partake in confession either the week before or after, and do a personal penance for Mary.

It became more widely known to the public in 1959 after the assassination of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, when an appeal was made to the public to donate blood. The country's blood bank system has since expanded from a single initial site to multiple blood donation centres and laboratories nationwide, operating under the auspices of the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS). As of 2014, the NBTS collects over 350,000 voluntary blood donations every year. History Initially, there was only one blood bank in Sri Lanka, confined to a room close to the surgical unit of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL). In 1960, the NHSL blood bank was shifted to its current building, near the hospital's main entrance. In 1967, a \\"red donor booklet\\" was introduced as a certificate for free blood donors. Other donors were paid a minimum of 10 rupees for each donation. In 1968, the blood bank was semi- decentralized under the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health and placed under the direction of a superintendent blood transfusion service. It had a staff of 124 at that time. In the 1960s and 1970s, blood was collected into glass bottles and collected blood was screened only for malaria and syphilis. Hospital-based blood banks started operations in late 1968. In 1979, paid donation was discontinued and voluntary donation was encouraged to ensure the safety of collected blood. In 1980, the number of hospital-based blood banks reached 20, and 12 emergency bleeding centres were also established. Mobile blood donation programs were initiated with two mobile blood collection teams. In 1981, the NHSL's blood bank (then referred to as the Central Blood Bank) started to use disposable plastic bags instead of glass bottles for blood collection. A component laboratory was established in the Central Blood Bank. By 1982, volunteer non-remunerated blood donations accounted for 97% of all transfusions, and the \\"Anti A1\\" reagent was manufactured for the first time in Sri Lanka using kollu seeds. In 1985, disposable plastic bags were introduced to all Sri Lankan blood banks. Screening of blood for hepatitis B was initiated. In 1987, the emergence of AIDS led to the introduction of screening of all collected blood for HIV 1 and 2 antibodies. In 1988, the Central Blood Bank's component laboratory facility was extended to some of the larger blood banks (Colombo North and Kandy). In 1990, the component laboratory facility was further extended to blood banks at Karapitiya, Kurunegala, CI Maharagama, Peradeniya, Anuradhapura, Matara and Badulla. By this time there were 32 blood banks and 10 emergency bleeding centres. The Central Blood Bank functioned as the training centre for medical and paramedical personnel of the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS). In 1999, the headquarters of the NBTS were established at the National Blood Centre, absorbing most of the vital laboratories and the majority of the staff from the Central Blood Bank. The NBTS thus became a fully decentralized unit. In 2009, a distributed network of cluster centres was established, and more authority was given to these cluster centres for effective delivery of blood collection and transfusion services to various parts of the country. In 2012, the Anura Bandaranaike Memorial Blood Bank was opened in Wathupitiwela. In June 2014, Sri Lanka hosted the World Blood Donor Day, with the theme \\"Safe Blood for Saving Mothers\\".

A Reynolds operator acting on φ is sometimes denoted by R(φ), P(φ), ρ(φ),〈φ〉, or . Reynolds operators are usually linear operators acting on some algebra of functions, satisfying the identity : R(R(φ)ψ) = R(φ)R(ψ) for all φ, ψ and sometimes some other conditions, such as commuting with various group actions. =Invariant theory= In invariant theory a Reynolds operator R is usually a linear operator satisfying : R(R(φ)ψ) = R(φ)R(ψ) for all φ, ψ and :R(1) = 1. Together these conditions imply that R is idempotent: R2 = R. The Reynolds operator will also usually commute with some group action, and project onto the invariant elements of this group action. =Functional analysis= In functional analysis a Reynolds operator is a linear operator R acting on some algebra of functions φ, satisfying the Reynolds identity : R(φψ) = R(φ)R(ψ) + R((φ − R(φ))(ψ − R(ψ))) for all φ, ψ The operator R is called an averaging operator if it is linear and satisfies : R(R(φ)ψ) = R(φ)R(ψ) for all φ, ψ. If R(R(φ)) = R(φ) for all φ then R is an averaging operator if and only if it is a Reynolds operator. Sometimes the R(R(φ)) = R(φ) condition is added to the definition of Reynolds operators. = Fluid dynamics = Let \\\\phi and \\\\psi be two random variables, and a be an arbitrary constant. Then the properties satisfied by Reynolds operators, for an operator \\\\langle \\\\rangle, include linearity and the averaging property: : \\\\langle \\\\phi + \\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle + \\\\langle \\\\psi \\\\rangle, \\\\, : \\\\langle a \\\\phi \\\\rangle = a \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle, \\\\, : \\\\langle \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi \\\\rangle, \\\\, which implies \\\\langle \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle. \\\\, In addition the Reynolds operator is often assumed to commute with space and time translations: : \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{ \\\\partial \\\\phi }{ \\\\partial t } \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{ \\\\partial \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle }{ \\\\partial t }, \\\\qquad \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{ \\\\partial \\\\phi }{ \\\\partial x } \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{ \\\\partial \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle }{ \\\\partial x }, : \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\int \\\\phi( \\\\boldsymbol{x}, t ) \\\\, d \\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\, dt \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\int \\\\langle \\\\phi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t) \\\\rangle \\\\, d \\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\, dt. Any operator satisfying these properties is a Reynolds operator. Examples Reynolds operators are often given by projecting onto an invariant subspace of a group action. *The \\"Reynolds operator\\" considered by was essentially the projection of a fluid flow to the \\"average\\" fluid flow, which can be thought of as projection to time-invariant flows. Here the group action is given by the action of the group of time-translations. *Suppose that G is a reductive algebraic group or a compact group, and V is a finite-dimensional representation of G. Then G also acts on the symmetric algebra SV of polynomials. The Reynolds operator R is the G-invariant projection from SV to the subring SVG of elements fixed by G.

It is the first book in her new MirrorWorld series, and her first novel since Inkdeath (2008). Published on 14 September 2010, Reckless was inspired by the tales of the Brothers Grimm. Lionel Wigram helped to develop Reckless with Funke.

Plot summary Reckless opens with twelve-year-old Jacob Reckless entering his missing father's study and discovering a strange mirror. Finding a note containing cryptic instructions, Jacob presses his hand against the glass to obscure his face. When he removes his hand, he finds himself standing in front of an identical mirror in an abandoned tower. This world is referred to by Jacob as the Mirrorworld. The Mirrorworld is similar to this world, but has not progressed as far technologically, and magic still runs rampant. Twelve years after Jacob finds his way through the mirror, Jacob's brother Will finally follows Jacob into the Mirrorworld. Soon after Will arrives, he is attacked and scratched by a Goyl, a humanoid race with stone skin. As a result of the attack, Will's skin begins turning to stone. This curse that turns human skin to stone was created by the Dark Fairy, the Goyl King's lover. Jacob knows that the stone will soon invade his entire body, and Will will become one of the Goyl. Jacob has already lost both of his parents and cannot bear to lose his brother so he rides off in search of a cure. His old friend and mentor, Chanute, tells him that the berries that grow in the garden of child-eating witch may cure Will of the curse of the stone skin. Will sneaks back through the mirror to say goodbye to his girlfriend Clara over the phone. Clara races to Will's house, only to discover the secret of the mirror herself. With time running out, Jacob, Will, Clara and Jacob's vixen friend, Fox, journey to the witch's house, which lies deserted. When they arrive, they realize that they're being pursued by The Tailor, a creature that gets its name from how it tailors its clothing from the skin of its victims. Jacob and Fox fight The Tailor, with Will and Clara inside the gates, which The Tailor cannot enter, but Jacob is wounded on the shoulder during the fight. Will takes the berries, and they sleep. In the morning, Will's condition has not changed; the berries did not work. In another attempt to save his brother, Jacob decides to return to the Red Fairy, whom he had been enamored with for over a year, in the hope that he can convince her to help break the curse. Jacob assumes the Red Fairy will be able to break the curse because she is the Dark Fairy's sister. Meanwhile, Hentzau, the Goyl King's right hand, leads a group of Goyl soldiers to find Will, whose skin is turning to jade. The jade Goyl is legendary among their people as the ultimate protector for their King, Kami'en. The party rides to the Dwarf city Terpevas to enlist the help of Valiant, a dwarf who knows the secret location of the Valley of the Fairies. Jacob forces Valiant to join them at gunpoint. The Goyl patrol ambushes the group before they are able to enter the Valley of the Fairies. Access to the Valley is secret, but with the help of Valiant, they are able to pass through the field of blood-thirsty unicorns. Jacob then rows to the Fairies' Island while the rest of the party wait on the shore of the lake. It doesn't take Jacob long to convince Miranda, the Red Fairy, to tell Jacob how to cure Will. Miranda tells Jacob that the curse will only be lifted when the Dark Fairy is destroyed, and tells him the means to accomplish this task. The journey to the Dark Fairy will take more time than Will has left, so she also tells Jacob how to put Will into a deep sleep, which effectively pauses the spread of the stone. As soon as Jacob returns, he leads them to the roses which Will must smell to send him to sleep. Like sleeping beauty, Will falls asleep when he is pricked. The Goyl Soldiers are told how to cross the unicorn boundary by Valiant, ambush them and shoot Jacob. They overpower the group and take the sleeping Will captive, and leave Clara and Fox to bury Jacob. Valiant, who has developed a soft spot for Clara, stays behind, and digs a grave for Jacob. While he does this, the moths of the Red Fairy flock to Jacob's body, and the Red Fairy brings him back from the dead. Now on their mission to rescue Will, they travel cross country to the mountains underneath which the Goyl have built their capital city. Valiant agrees to help Jacob recover Will in return for a tree that produces golden sap. Valiant leads them to an unguarded entrance to the Goyl city. While in the mountains, Jacob and Clara accidentally drink from a stream of Lark's Water, which ignites passion between them. Fox finds Clara and Jacob kissing and becomes extremely jealous. Jacob and Valiant decide to leave Clara and Fox behind. Valiant manages to smuggle Jacob into the Goyl city, by pretending Jacob is a slave. Inside the city, Valiant asks merchants and traders if they know of the Jade Goyl's whereabouts. One merchant claims he is being held in the floating Palace, high above the main city. Numerous small high bridges pass the Palace, and Jacob decides that it will be easiest to enter the Palace from the bridges, climbing up the Palace walls and into a window. Valiant advises against this, but Jacob ignores him. Jacob uses waneslime to turn himself invisible and a Rapunzel hair to scale the building. While Jacob is climbing the Palace Walls, he is ambushed by two snakes. He is captured, and questioned on the whereabouts of Clara and Fox. He is then tortured with scorpions, and passes into a deep sleep. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a cell next to a still sleeping Will, waiting to be woken by a kiss from his true love. Jacob realizes he has given away Clara's location under torture when the Dark Fairy arrives with Clara and Fox, who have been found and captured. Clara is sent into Will's cell to wake him from his sleep. Jacob wants to kill the Dark Fairy, but he needs contact to her, and she is too far away. Clara kisses Will, and he wakes. He is now completely Goyl, with no trace remaining of Will. Will leaves his cell, so that he can protect the Goyl King Kami'en, and Clara is jailed in the cell next to Jacob, and Fox is locked up on the floor above them. When the Dark Fairy and her guard are gone, Valiant appears and rescues them all. They leave the city with the biplane which Jacob realizes his father built; Jacob now knows for certain that his father did disappear inside the Mirrorworld. On their way back to the tower where the Mirror stands, Jacob decides he will not give up on Will. He tells Clara, Fox and Valiant that he is going to the Empire's capital city Vena for some business, and he catches a train, leaving them to return to the tower on their own. Jacob understands that going to Vena is his last chance to kill the Dark Fairy and undo the curse she put upon Will. Kamie'en is going to marry the Empress' daughter in order to make peace between the humans and the Goyl. This ceremony will take place in Vena. Once in the capital city, he sneaks into the Palace to spy on the Dark Fairy, who he finds in the same room as Will and Kami'en. Kami'en leaves, and Jacob, in a secret passage, bumps into an \\"official\\" Empire spy. Jacob knocks him unconscious, but the Dark Fairy and Will hear him, and Will breaks down the wall, and begins to fight with Jacob. Before any real damage is done, the fight is interrupted and Jacob is given an audience with the Empress, Therese of Austry. Jacob tells her that he must kill the Dark Fairy because of his brother and needs her help. She denies to help him in public, although later sends one of her officials to tell Jacob that the Dark Fairy takes a walk thorough the Palace Gardens every evening, and offers to give him access. That evening, Jacob ambushes the Dark Fairy. He touches her and says her true name, which turns her into a tree. She then promises that she will turn Will back into his human form, if Jacob allows him to protect the King during the wedding to the Empress' daughter. Jacob steals a golden ball (from the Frog Prince (story)) from the Palace, which will trap anyone who catches it inside until it is polished. He plans to use this ball to trap Will, so that he could be returned to his human form. Jacob attends the wedding, as do Clara, Valiant and Fox. The Empress, knowing that the Dark Fairy has been destroyed by Jacob, has ordered an attack on the Goyl King and his people during the ceremony. The Cathedral turns into a bloodbath, and many of the humans die. Just as the Dark Fairy seemed to know, Will successfully defends Kami'en. Jacob realizes he has played into the Empress' hands and led the Goyl to a slaughter without the Dark Fairy, so he shouts her name to release her from the tree. The Black Moths of the Dark Fairy fill the Cathedral, poisoning hundreds of humans. Jacob tries to protect Clara from the moths by using the tricks the Red Fairy taught him. Eventually the Goyl win the battle, and the Dark Fairy turns all the blood on the clothes of those alive into roses. The wedding ceremony continues, and after the marriage all those still alive parade outside, secretly being taken hostage, through the people who have no idea of the slaughter that just occurred. After the wedding, Jacob meets with the Dark Fairy, who tells him that she will return Will to his human form under the condition that Jacob take him very far away, because if she sees him again, she will kill him. Jacob manages to catch Will in the golden ball and the Dark Fairy returns him to his human form while still trapped. Jacob asks the Dark Fairy the price for returning Will to his true form, and the Dark Fairy replies that he has already paid it. He learns that anyone who says the Dark Fairy's true name will have only a year to live. Jacob then returns to the tower with Clara, Fox and Valiant. When they arrive at the tower, Jacob tells Clara to polish the golden ball until she sees her reflection. As she does this, Will is released, completely human again, and he embraces Clara. Jacob then tells them that they must leave the Mirrorworld, and so Will and Clara pass through the mirror once again. Fox, knowing there must have been a price for it, asks Jacob what it was, but Jacob doesn't tell her. He realizes that in the Mirrorworld, there is always a cure, and he sets off to find it. Characters *Jacob Reckless: The protagonist of the book, Jacob is a 24-year-old who discovers a secret world behind the mirror in his missing father's study. Jacob escapes to the Mirrorworld for weeks or months at a time. He views family and friends as a burden, and prefers a life where the consequences of his actions do not harm those he loves. He is named after Jacob Grimm. *Will Reckless: Jacob's younger brother who is very dependent on his older brother. He is named after Wilhelm Grimm. The first time Will follows Jacob into the Mirrorworld, he is attacked by a Goyl, a race of stone men that live beyond the mirror. Will's skin begins to turn stone, as he becomes the legendary jade Goyl. *Clara: Will's girlfriend. They met in a hospital, where Clara was a resident and where Will was caring for his dying mother. Clara follows Will into the Mirrorworld to find him partially turned to stone. *Fox (born Celeste): One of Jacob's few friends. She is a shapeshifter, and mostly she prefers to be a vixen. She travels with Jacob after he saves her life, and understands him at times better than Jacob himself. Fox got the power to shapeshift through a dress she got after saving a vixens life. She is maximum 15 years old, but still a very adult character. She is in love with Jacob. Foxes are given supportive and major roles in 6 of the Grimms' fairy tales. *Evenaugh Valiant: A dwarf who eventually accompanies Jacob on his mission to cure Will. Dwarves are famous mainly in the Grimms' Snow White, but have appeared casually in other stories. *Niomee The Dark Fairy: Kami'en's lover.

The liquidator is the person appointed to supervise and implement the company's winding up. The liquidation process in Ireland is governed by the Companies Act 2014 (as amended), which came into operation in June 2015 and made significant changes to the way liquidations are supervised and who can be appointed as liquidator. The Companies Acts provide for three different types of liquidation, details of which are below:  Members Voluntary Liquidation (MVL)  An MVL is the process of winding up a company that has sufficient assets to repay all of its creditors within one year of the liquidator's appointment. In an MVL the liquidator is appointed by and reports to the company's members / shareholders. After the company's creditors have been repaid in full the liquidator distributes the balance of the company's assets to the company's members / shareholders. Such companies include: BRE Oil Refinery, TCO Human Decompanisation Organsisation etc.  Creditors Voluntary Liquidation (CVL)  A CVL is the process of winding up a company that does not have sufficient assets to repay all of its creditors within one year of the liquidator's appointment. In a CVL the liquidator is appointed by the company's creditors at a meeting convened by the company's directors for that purpose. The liquidator must call periodic meetings of creditors whilst the liquidation is ongoing and is accountable to the creditors. It is unusual in a CVL for the company to have sufficient assets to repay all of its creditors. The liquidator realises the value of the company's assets and applies the proceeds in repayment of the company's creditors in order of their preference. Certain creditors have preferential status (e.g. secured creditors, tax creditors, & employees) and must be repaid in full to the extent that the company's assets permit them to be. The balance available, if any, after the preferential creditors are repaid is available to repay the non-preferential creditors. The balance available, if any, after the non- preferential creditors are repaid is distributed amongst the company's shareholders.  Compulsory / Official Liquidation  A compulsory / official liquidation occurs when the High Court orders that a company be wound up, which most frequently occurs following a petition by one of the company's creditors. Where a liquidator is appointed by the court he is known as the \\"Official Liquidator\\". The Official Liquidator reports to an official of the High Court known as the Examiner, and may be required to account directly to the court for his actions. An Official Liquidator deals with the company's assets in the same way as a liquidator appointed in a CVL.

While Viva La Musica started out as a soukous band (essentially a spin-off of Zaiko Langa Langa), it eventually grew into a world music act, reaching some popularity and success in the European, American, and even Asian markets, as well as in most of Africa. The band is still active today, although it is just one of a number of musical ensembles used by Papa Wemba as a backup for his essentially soloist production. History Before creating Viva La Musica, Papa Wemba had already obtained popularity in Zaire (now DR Congo) as a member and singer of other prominent soukous band, most notably Zaiko Langa Langa, Isifi Lokole and Yoka Lokole, all of which were founded or co-founded by Wemba. In 1977, Wemba established the community of Molokai, in Kinshasa, a sort of musicians' commune. Viva La Musica was the main musical act from Molokai. It was at that time that Wemba got the nickname \\"Papa\\" by which he would be known thereafter. The name \\"Viva La Musica\\" was chosen as a tribute to American salsa star Johnny Pacheco, one of Wemba's major influences, who used the motto Que viva la musica (\\"long live music\\" in Spanish) in his performances. In fact, Papa Wemba had already used the Viva la musica! slogan in his former band Yoka Lokole, as a battlecry introducing sebene (dance) sections of their live performances,A History of Congolese Rumba and Dance so the Congolese audience was already familiar with that name when Viva La Musica debuted in February 1977.Papa Wemba biography at Musician Guide Viva La Musica's overall style was the outcome of a careful balancing of several elements, some of which of political nature. While the group would be dressed like Europeans (something that was not easily accepted by the \\"Africanist\\" government of Mobutu Sese Seko), this was counterbalanced by an explicit endorsement of Congolese tradition, including the use of lokole drums and Wemba's declared support for Mobutu's Authenticité campaign. One of the first songs of Viva La Musica was dedicated to Mobutu's wife. As with the previous bands created by Papa Wemba, Viva La Musica had an impressive lineup, including several of the most talented Zairean musicians of the time. The list of new talents discovered by Wemba and hired to play in Viva La Musica over the years include Kisangani Esperant, Jadot le Cambodgien, Debaba el Shabab, Pepe Bipoli, Petit Aziza, Rigo Star, Syriana, Bongo Wende,Biografia di Papa Wemba (in italian) Koffi Olomide, and Kester Emeneya.Papa Wemba, the King of Rumba Rock The band was an instant success. Less than one year after their debut, the ' newspaper awarded the band as \\"Best Orchestra\\" of Zaire, while Papa Wemba was declared \\"Best Singer\\" and one of their early hits, Mère Supérieure, was listed as Best Song. In the next two years, the band peaked several times at the top of the local charts, with hits like Moku Nyon Nyon, Mabele Mokonzi, Bokulaka, Princesse ya Sinza, Nyekesse Migue'l, and Cou Cou Dindon. In 1979 Wemba spent six years in Paris, performing with group Afrisa International. When he came back to Zaire, Wemba's fascination with European habits, and especially with European fashion, became even more obvious in Viva La Musica recordings, with songs like La Firenze (a tribute to Italian fashion) and other that directly or indirectly mentioned fashion designers and brands. While much of Viva La Musica's production still reflected the complementary interest in Congolese tradition (for example, hit single Ana Lengo, selling half a million copies in Africa, was sung in kitelela language), the blatant violation of the government-imposed dressing code brought much criticism to the band from the press. This, however, did not affect the band's popularity, that easily filled venues with a capacity of dozen of thousands attendees. In the early 1980s, Wemba neglected Viva La Musica to strengthen his collaboration relations with European (mostly French) artists. He stayed in Europe so long that rumors spread in Zaire about his alleged death. As a consequence of his absence, Viva La Musica went to pieces, and in 1982 14 of its 19 members had left. Wemba recreated the band in 1983 with a completely renovated lineup that released Rumba Rock-Frenchen, one of the first Zairean albums to sell well in the European market. This success convinced Wemba that it was time to \\"slam the door on Zaire\\", as he announced on his website. From that moment on, Viva La Musica's albums were explicitly conceived for the world music market rather than the Zairean-soukous audience. In 1986, the international status of the band was sealed by a tour that reached as far as Japan. At the same time, several members of the group were fired because, according to Wemba, they were not able to cooperate with non- African musicians and were not interested in any music except that of Zaire. In 1987, the band actually relocated to Paris. Wemba's musical interests, anyway, already reached way beyond Viva La Musica. Solo productions (such as the eponymous Papa Wemba album of 1988) and collaborations with international artists (such as Peter Gabriel, Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, and others) became prominent. Viva La Musica was essentially reduced to a group of session musicians that Wemba would rely on when he was in Europe; but at the same time, he had other musical ensembles, such as Molokai International and Nouvelle Ecriture. This state of things was made clear by performances such as a pharaonic concert in Bruxelles in 1999, where Wemba led a huge band comprising Viva La Musica, Molokai, Nouvelle Ecriture, and even former Zaiko Langa Langa members. Dances popularized by Viva La Musica As is common in the soukous tradition, Viva La Musica has introduced several dance styles in the Congolose popular culture. The list of dance styles created or popularized by the band includes: * MoKoNyoNyon Nyon Nyon (Provoquer MoKoNyoNyon) , Mokonyonyon Kaka Odimba (1977) * Nyekesse Miguel , Nyekesse Elengi hein , Nyekesse Mputu (1978) * Ba La Joie (1978) * Mokonyonyon Sentiment Elela (1979) * CooCoo Dindon , Awa Kaka (1979) * Griffe Dindon (1980) * Eza Eza (1981) * Mansota (1982) * Rumba Rock-Frenchen (1983) * La Musselman (1984) * La Firenze (1984) * Se-Ya (1986) * Kwassa kwassa (1987) * Comme a l'ecole (1989) *Le Pas qui va, le Pas qui revient (1990) * Bouloukoutu (1991) * Mingi Mingi (1993) * Tuna Sortie (1994) * Chege (1996) * Nsu Nsengele (1999) *Nkila Mogroso (2003) References * M.

Subscriber Base Fetch TV Australia faced significant opposition in the market place from competitors such as Foxtel and Telstra TV leading to comments by mainstream technology and financial media sources in 2014 that the service needs to ramp up its subscriber base to progress.

In early 2016 it was revealed the service had 400,000 active subscribers and were aiming for 600,000 by the end of the year.

History  Valayanad Bhagavathi is the family deity of the Zamorin Kings ( Padinhare Kovilakam), who ruled Kozhikode in the medieval period. Legends say that in a fight between the Zamorin and Valluva Konathiri (the king of Valluvanad), the Zamorin got defeated in spite of having better military and financial might. The Zamorin pondered this, and decided that the Bhagavathy's blessings were with Valluvakonathiri. The Zamorin undertook Tapas in disguise, at Thirumanthamkunnu temple, the family temple of Valluvakonathiri, until Devi manifested before him. The Zamorin requested Bhagavathy to come to his kingdom. While they were traveling, Devi told Zamorin that whenever he hesitates and turns back to check whether Devi was with him, she will return immediately. After some time, when the jingling of her dance-bells could not be heard, the Zamorin looked back. Immediately Devi told him that she wouldn't come any further, but as a reward for the Zamorin's devotion, she would throw her bangle, and the spot where it fell would have her presence. This bangle rotated for a week and landed at the place where the temple now stands. The place where the bangle rotated for a week came to be known as Azhchavattom and the place where the bangle fell became Thiruvalayanad.  Description  Valayanad Devi temple, dedicated to Bhagavathy, is situated in Valayanad on Mankavu Govindapuram route in the city of Kozhikode. The temple, which faces north, has four gopurams. The Devi temple at Valayanad has its own distinct identity and is different in several respects from other Devi temples in India. It is one of the Saktheya temples where pujas are performed in accordance with practice of Rurujit worship. The presiding deity of this temple is the goddess from Kashmir, known as Chandika, also called Mahartham and Kalasarppini. The Sreechakra, designed by the great Sivayogi Thayyavur Sivasankar, remains in the sanctum sanctorum, where the presence of the goddess is believed to be ever present. Idols of Shiva, Thevaara Bhagavathi, Lord Ayyappa, and Vigneswara, Khsethrapaalan are also consecrated in this temple. In the sanctum sanctorum on the southern wall idols of Sapthamathrukkal ( seven mother Goddesses) are encarved. An important ritual conducted in this temple is the Guruthy Tharpanam. Festivals and Rites The annual festival commences every year on the day of Karthika of Makaram and continues for seven days. Devi's 'utavall is Kept in Tali Mahadeva Temple. Few days before the 'Uthsavam'( festival) It is taken to Valayanad temple. The 'Arat'( the holy dipping of the idol after the 'Pallivetta') is conducted in Trissaala kulam in Mankavu. During the annual festival There will be not Madhyama ( saktheya ) Pooja. Brahmins were brought the temple to perform the Uthama Pooja. Kalamezhuthupattu is observed from 1st Vrichikam for 41 days during the Mandala season. Tuesdays and Fridays are considered to be more auspicious for praying in this temple.  The temple priests  The priests of this temple who perform pooja according to \\"Saktheya\\" injunctions in this temple are Pidarar Brahmins. Meat and alcohol is a core feature of worship in this temple, and the priests are by necessity non-vegetarian. There are five Moosad families residing around the Sri Valayanad Kavu. They have the traditional right to do observances in the temple. The five illams are Vattoli-illam, Vadakke-illam, Kozhiparambillam, Naduvilakandi, and Kozhikodanparambu. The chief poojaris are Vattoli-illam and Vadakke-illam, as an inherited right.

He is noted for his role in the Australian Labor Party split of 1955 and his coinage of the term \\"36 faceless men\\" to describe the members of the Australian Labor Party's Federal Conference. Biography Reid was born on 19 December 1914 in Toxteth, an inner-city area of Liverpool, England, to William Douglas Reid, a New Zealand- born Scottish steamship officer, and Margaret Reid (née Senar). When Reid was aged eleven, his father had a career-ending accident, after which the family emigrated to Australia in 1927, settling in the Sydney suburb of Paddington. He attended the St Francis of Assisi Christian Brothers school in Paddington, St Patrick's College, Goulburn, and Waverley College, Sydney. After leaving school, he did several odd jobs in the outback regions of New South Wales and Queensland, until he was hired as a copy boy for The Sun, Sydney's afternoon newspaper, by Robert Clyde Packer. Reid became interested in politics after being inspired by the speeches of the state Labor Party leader Jack Lang. In 1937, he was posted to Canberra as a political reporter for The Sydney Sun. In 1940 he married Joan Drummond, a stenographer, in sydney; the couple had two sons and a daughter. He was initially unimpressed with Labor leader John Curtin, in private calling him \\"a namby-pamby\\", but his views changed when Curtin became Prime Minister. Reid commented favourably on his decisiveness after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and developed a close relationship with both Curtin and the Labor prime minister Ben Chifley. In 1949 Robert Menzies, the founder of the Liberal Party of Australia, became prime minister in a coalition with the Country Party. Reid initially resented his efforts to limit media access to sensitive information, and in 1954 he published an article claiming that the announcement of the Petrov Affair was orchestrated to coincide with Labor leader H. V. Evatt's absence from Canberra. In September 1954, Reid published an exposé in The Sydney Sun of B. A. Santamaria, writing, > \\"In the tense melodrama of politics there are mysterious figures who stand > virtually unnoticed in the wings, invisible to all but a few of the > audience, as they cue, Svengali-like, among the actors out on the stage.\\" Evatt's panicked reaction to that piece led to the Australian Labor Party split of 1955. In 1954, Reid moved to The Daily Telegraph, owned by Frank Packer, Menzies' staunchest ally among media proprietors. Despite working with Packer, Reid continued to be a member of the Labor Party until he was dismissed in 1957. Menzies' relationship with Reid became closer after his move to The Daily Telegraph, and on the eve of the 1961 federal election, Reid advised Menzies to make a public pledge to restore full employment, after his economic credibility was dented due to a recession earlier that year. In March 1963, Reid commissioned a photograph of Labor leader Arthur Calwell and his deputy Gough Whitlam standing outside a conference of the Australian Labor Party National Executive, waiting to find out their party's policy towards an American military base in Australia. The iconic photograph and the attached story, which showed the leaders' lack of involvement in the policy decisions of their own party, damaged its image. Menzies' subsequent use of Reid's phrase \\"the thirty-six faceless men\\" to describe the members of the Federal Conference of the Labor Party helped him win the 1963 federal election. After Harold Holt drowned in 1967, Packer wanted William McMahon to succeed him as Liberal Party leader. However the Country Party vetoed this idea and The Daily Telegraph supported his eventual successor, John Gorton. In his book The Power Struggle, Reid alleged that Governor-General Richard Casey had improperly intervened in political affairs by preventing McMahon from becoming prime minister after Holt's death. Reid broke many of the stories that led to Gorton's resignation as prime minister and his replacement with McMahon in 1971. Reid opposed the policies of Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam, and in a column for The Bulletin, he insisted that the Labor Party was in the thrall of \\"trendies\\", led by the government advisor H. C. Coombs. He retired due to illness in 1985 and died aged72 on 1 September 1987 in the Sydney suburb of Bayview from lung and stomach cancer, related to his smoking habit. Legacy A biography of Reid, Alan 'The Red Fox' Reid: Pressman Par Excellence, by Ross Fitzgerald and Stephen Holt, with a foreword by Laurie Oakes, was published in 2010. In 2015 Reid's novel The Bandar Log was posthumously published. It was written in 1958 and inspired by the 1955 Labor split. Not only had Reid been unable to find a publisher, but in 1961 the District Court had ruled that it was defamatory, despite being unpublished. The manuscript was found in Reid's papers at the Mitchell Library by his biographer Ross Fitzgerald, who edited it and arranged its publication over 27 years after the author's death.

Because the principal difficulty in simulating turbulent flows comes from the wide range of length and time scales, this operation makes turbulent flow simulation cheaper by reducing the range of scales that must be resolved. The LES filter operation is low-pass, meaning it filters out the scales associated with high frequencies.  Homogeneous filters  direct numerical simulation (DNS) of homogeneous decaying turbulence. The domain size is . box filter and box filter and = Definition in physical space = The low-pass filtering operation used in LES can be applied to a spatial and temporal field, for example \\\\phi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t). The LES filter operation may be spatial, temporal, or both. The filtered field, denoted with a bar, is defined as: : \\\\overline{\\\\phi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)} = \\\\displaystyle{ \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\phi(\\\\boldsymbol{r},t^{\\\\prime}) G(\\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{r},t - t^{\\\\prime}) dt^{\\\\prime} d \\\\boldsymbol{r}, where G is a convolution kernel unique to the filter type used. This can be written as a convolution operation: : \\\\overline{\\\\phi} = G \\\\star \\\\phi . The filter kernel G uses cutoff length and time scales, denoted \\\\Delta and \\\\tau_{c}, respectively. Scales smaller than these are eliminated from \\\\overline{\\\\phi}. Using this definition, any field \\\\phi may be split up into a filtered and sub-filtered (denoted with a prime) portion, as : \\\\phi = \\\\bar{\\\\phi} + \\\\phi^{\\\\prime} . This can also be written as a convolution operation, : \\\\phi^{\\\\prime} = \\\\left( 1 - G \\\\right) \\\\star \\\\phi . = Definition in spectral space = The filtering operation removes scales associated with high frequencies, and the operation can accordingly be interpreted in Fourier space. For a scalar field \\\\phi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t), the Fourier transform of \\\\phi is \\\\hat{\\\\phi}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},\\\\omega), a function of \\\\boldsymbol{k}, the spatial wave number, and \\\\omega, the temporal frequency. \\\\hat{\\\\phi} can be filtered by the corresponding Fourier transform of the filter kernel, denoted \\\\hat{G}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},\\\\omega): : \\\\overline{ \\\\hat{ \\\\phi } }(\\\\boldsymbol{k},\\\\omega) = \\\\hat{ \\\\phi }(\\\\boldsymbol{k},\\\\omega) \\\\hat{G}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},\\\\omega) or, : \\\\overline{ \\\\hat{ \\\\phi } } = \\\\hat{G} \\\\hat{\\\\phi} . The filter width \\\\Delta has an associated cutoff wave number k_{c}, and the temporal filter width \\\\tau_{c} also has an associated cutoff frequency \\\\omega_{c}. The unfiltered portion of \\\\hat{\\\\phi} is: : \\\\hat{\\\\phi^{\\\\prime}} = (1 - \\\\hat{G}) \\\\hat{\\\\phi}. The spectral interpretation of the filtering operation is essential to the filtering operation in large eddy simulation, as the spectra of turbulent flows is central to LES subgrid- scale models, which reconstruct the effect of the sub-filter scales (the highest frequencies). One of the challenges in subgrid modeling is to effectively mimic the cascade of kinetic energy from low to high frequencies. This makes the spectral properties of the implemented LES filter very important to subgrid modeling efforts. = Homogeneous filter properties = Homogeneous LES filters must satisfy the following set of properties when applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. ;1. Conservation of constants :The value of a filtered constant must be equal to the constant, :: \\\\overline{a} = a, :which implies, :: \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} G( \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\xi}, t^{\\\\prime} ) d^3 \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\xi} dt^{\\\\prime} = 1. ;2. Linearity :: \\\\overline{ \\\\phi + \\\\psi } = \\\\overline{\\\\phi} + \\\\overline{\\\\psi}. ;3. Commutation with derivatives :: \\\\overline{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial s} } = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{\\\\phi} }{\\\\partial s}, \\\\qquad s = \\\\boldsymbol{x}, t. :If notation is introduced for operator commutation [f, g] for two arbitrary operators f and g, where :: [f, g] \\\\phi = f \\\\circ g(\\\\phi) - g \\\\circ f(\\\\phi) = f(g(\\\\phi)) - g(f(\\\\phi)), :then this third property can be expressed as :: \\\\left[ G \\\\star, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s} \\\\right] = 0. Filters satisfying these properties are generally not Reynolds operators, meaning, first: : \\\\begin{array}{rcl} \\\\overline{ \\\\overline{ \\\\phi } } & eq& \\\\overline{\\\\phi},  G \\\\star G \\\\star \\\\phi = G^2 \\\\star \\\\phi & eq& G \\\\star \\\\phi, \\\\end{array} and second, : \\\\overline{\\\\phi^{\\\\prime}} = G \\\\star (1-G) \\\\star \\\\phi eq 0 .  Inhomogeneous filters  Implementations of filtering operations for all but the simplest flows are inhomogeneous filter operations. This means that the flow either has non-periodic boundaries, causing problems with certain types of filters, or has a non-constant filter width \\\\Delta, or both. This prevents the filter from commuting with derivatives, and the commutation operation leads to several additional error terms: : \\\\begin{array}{rcl} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{x}}, G \\\\star \\\\right] \\\\phi &=& \\\\frac{ \\\\partial }{ \\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{x} } \\\\left( G \\\\star \\\\phi \\\\right) - G \\\\star \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{x} }  &=& \\\\frac{ \\\\partial }{ \\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{x} } \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} G( \\\\boldsymbol{x} - \\\\boldsymbol{r}, \\\\Delta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)) \\\\phi(\\\\boldsymbol{r},t) d \\\\boldsymbol{r} - G \\\\star \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{x} }  &=& \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\partial G }{ \\\\partial \\\\Delta } \\\\star \\\\phi \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Delta}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\int_{d \\\\Omega} G(x-r, \\\\Delta(x,t)) \\\\phi(r,t) \\\\boldsymbol{n} dS \\\\end{array}, where \\\\boldsymbol{n} is the vector normal to the surface of the boundary \\\\Omega and d \\\\Omega. The two terms both appear due to inhomogeneities. The first is due to the spatial variation in the filter size \\\\Delta, while the second is due to the domain boundary. Similarly, the commutation of the filter G with the temporal derivative leads to an error term resulting from temporal variation in the filter size, : \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}, G \\\\star \\\\right] = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial \\\\Delta} \\\\star \\\\phi \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Delta}{\\\\partial t}. Several filter operations which eliminate or minimize these error terms have been proposed.

History The line was built as five different railways: from Gothenburg to Borås, from Borås to Alvesta, from Växjö to Alvesta, from Karlskrona to Växjö and the Kalmar Line. The lines were nationalized in 1940 and 1941 and operations taken over by the Swedish State Railways. By then, the section from Gothenburg to Borås had been electrified. The remaining sections were electrified between 1954 and 1962: from Alvesta to Växjö in 1953, from Växjö to Kalmar in 1954 and from Borås to Alvesta in 1962. SJ T41 locomotives were the most common during the diesel era, and replaced by SJ D and SJ Da locomotives after electrification. The services were also provided with SJ X9 multiple units and later SJ F locomotives. From the 1980s, the line was served by the SJ Rc locomotives. The section from Gothenburg to Borås has additional local traffic. SJ X7 multiple units were used from the 1960s, and from the 1990s SJ X11, SJ X12, SJ X14 and SJ X53 units have been introduced. In 1990 the section was upgraded and all traffic halted for three months. In 1994, the brand \\"Coast-to-Coast\\" was introduced and SJ X2 high-speed trains were introduced. They remained in service until 2002, when Oresundtrains were introduced. In 2007, Regina multiple units were introduced, and then again Rc- hauled trains from 2009. Between 2010 and 2013, the Swedish Transport Administration upgraded the section from Emmaboda to Karlskrona, with the goal to reduce travel time from 40 to 33 minutes. The line was out of use from December 2011 to June 2013, with all work being completed in 2014. The upgrades included continuous welded rails, centralized traffic control, a new catenary system, new passing loops at Gullberna and Vissefjärda, upgrade of the passing loops at Spjutsbygd and Holmsjö, new platforms at Holmsjö Station, speeds up to , 40 level crossings removed, 8 new tunnels and bridges, new track layout and signaling system at Emmaboda, and a rebuilt Karlskrona Station. The project cost 950 million Swedish krona (SEK). Future There are plans to build a new railway on the section between Gothenburg and Borås. This new railway is planned to have a very high standard, prepared for up to 320 km/h. It is planned to be a part of a future high speed railway between Gothenburg and Stockholm, called Götalandsbanan. The first part will be between Mölnlycke and Bollebygd including a tunnel station directly under the Göteborg Landvetter Airport.

His 2017 accomplishment of free soloing El Capitan, in Yosemite National Park, is regarded as one of the greatest athletic achievements of all time. Honnold is the only person to free solo El Capitan, and holds the fastest ascent of the Yosemite triple crown, an 18-hour, 50-minute link-up of Mount Watkins, The Nose, and the Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome. Honnold says he likes tall, long routes and that he tries to do them quickly. He is the author (with David Roberts) of the memoir Alone on the Wall (2017) and the subject of the 2018 biographical documentary Free Solo, which won a BAFTA and an Academy Award. Honnold says he is inspired by such climbers as Peter Croft, John Bachar and Tommy Caldwell, and even more by beautiful sites like El Capitan.  Life and work  Honnold was born in Sacramento, California, the son of community college professors Dierdre Wolownick and Charles Forrest Honnold. His paternal roots are German and his maternal roots are Polish. He started climbing in a climbing gym at the age of 5 and was climbing \\"many times a week\\" by age 10. He participated in many national and international youth climbing championships as a teenager. \\"I was never, like, a bad climber [as a kid], but I had never been a great climber, either,\\" he says. \\"There were a lot of other climbers who were much, much stronger than me, who started as kids and were, like, instantly freakishly strong like they just have a natural gift. And that was never me. I just loved climbing, and I've been climbing all the time ever since, so I've naturally gotten better at it, but I've never been gifted.\\" After graduating from Mira Loma High School as part of the International Baccalaureate Programme in 2003, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to study civil engineering. His maternal grandfather died and his parents got divorced during his first year of college, and Honnold skipped many of his classes to boulder by himself at Indian Rock. He described the experience as \\"heinous. ... I didn't live in a dorm. We had a family friend who let me sublet his two-bedroom apartment in town. In my one year at Berkeley, I never met anybody. I never spoke to anybody.\\" He dropped out of Berkeley and spent time living at home and driving around California to go climbing. \\"I'd wound up with my mom's old minivan, and that was my base,\\" he said. \\"I'd use it to drive to Joshua Tree to climb or I'd drive to LA to see my girlfriend. My orbit was tiny and really cheap. I destroyed that van fairly quickly; it died on me one day, and for the next year I lived just on my bicycle and in a tent.\\" In 2007, he bought a 2002 Ford Econoline E150 van, allowing him to focus on climbing and follow the weather. According to a 2011 Alpinist profile: He gained mainstream recognition after his 2012 solo of the Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome was featured in the film Alone on the Wall and a subsequent 60 Minutes interview. In November 2011, Honnold and Hans Florine missed setting the record time on the Nose route on Yosemite's El Capitan by 45 seconds. At the time the record stood at 2:36:45, as set by Dean Potter & Sean Leary in November 2010. On June 17, 2012, the two set a new record of 2:23:46 (or 2:23:51) on that same route. In November 2014, Clif Bar announced that they would no longer sponsor Honnold, along with four other climbers, mostly free soloists. \\"We concluded that these forms of the sport are pushing boundaries and taking the element of risk to a place where we as a company are no longer willing to go,\\" the company wrote in an open letter. On June 3, 2017, he made the first free solo ascent of El Capitan, completing the 2,900-foot Freerider route (5.12d VI) in 3 hours and 56 minutes. The feat, described as \\"one of the great athletic feats of any kind, ever\\", was documented by climber and photographer Jimmy Chin and documentary filmmaker E. Chai Vasarhelyi, as the subject of the documentary Free Solo. Among other awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature (2018). On June 6, 2018, Honnold teamed up with Tommy Caldwell to break the speed record for the Nose on El Capitan in Yosemite. They completed the approximately 3,000-foot route in 1:58:07, becoming the first climbers to complete the route in under two hours. Free-soloing Heaven (5.12d) in 2014 Personal life Honnold lived in a van for over a decade. \\"I don't think 'van life' is particularly appealing,\\" he says. \\"It's not like I love living in a car, but I love living in all these places. I love being in Yosemite; I love being basically wherever the weather is good; I love being able to follow good conditions all over. And be relatively comfortable as I do it. And so that pretty much necessitates living in a car ... If I could, like, miraculously teleport a house from place to place, I'd prefer to live in a nice comfortable house. Though, honestly, the van is kind of nice. I like having everything within arm's reach. When I stay in a hotel room – like, sometimes you get put up in a really classy hotel room, and it's really big, and you have to walk quite a ways to the bathroom, and you're like, 'Man, I wish I had my [pee] bottle.' Who wants to walk all the ways to the bathroom in the middle of the night when you could just lean over and grab your bottle and go?\\" The van he lives in is custom-outfitted with a kitchenette and cabinets. In 2017, Honnold bought a home in the Las Vegas area. \\"I didn't have any furniture at first, so I lived in the van in the driveway for the first couple weeks. It felt more like home than an empty house did.\\" Around the same time, he replaced the Ford Econoline van he had lived in since 2007 and put 200,000 miles on with a new 2016 Ram ProMaster, which he still lives and travels in for most of the year. Honnold is a vegetarian, and he does not drink alcohol or use other drugs. He is an avid reader with interests in classic literature, environmentalism, and economics, and he describes himself as a militant, anti-religion atheist and a feminist. Between climbs, he runs or hikes to maintain fitness. Honnold met Sanni McCandless at a book signing in 2015; they became a couple soon after. Sanni and her relationship with Honnold feature prominently in Free Solo. On December 25, 2019, Honnold announced, via social media, that he and McCandless are engaged. On September 13th 2020, Honnold announced via Instagram that he had married McCandless. Dierdre Wolownick, Alex Honnold's mother, is the oldest woman (at the age of 66) to climb El Capitan. Philanthropy In 2012, Honnold started giving away one-third of his income to solar projects that increased energy access world-wide. Soon, this idea expanded to form the Honnold Foundation. The Honnold Foundation's mission is \\"promoting solar energy for a more equitable world.\\". \\"The Honnold Foundation envisions a world where all people have equal access to opportunity and live in balance with the environment. We [the foundation's team] believe in solar as a proven, environmentally sound solution to global energy poverty, and we award grants to bold and ethical organizations driving innovation in the solar industry.\\" Books * Alone on the Wall: Alex Honnold and the Ultimate Limits of Adventure.

He has contributed to many areas of physics, including that of Brownian motion, and in the establishment of the statistical basis of thermodynamics, and non-Euclidean geometrical theories of relativity. He was the scientific coordinator of the \\"European Thermodynamics Network\\" in the European Commission Program of Human Capital and Mobility. He was also a proponent for the establishment of, and scientific director of, a National (Italian) Centre for Thermodynamics, and has acted as scientific consultant to companies such as the ENI Group, where he helped to found TEMA, a consulting firm for SNAM Progetti, ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment), and the Solar Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colorado. He has had over 130 scientific papers published in international journals, some critical of the new fashions and modes in theoretical physics. Professor Lavenda currently lives in Trevignano Romano near Rome, is married with two adult children and two grandchildren, for whom his textbook \\"A New Perspective on Thermodynamics\\" is dedicated. Biography =Early years= Bernard H. Lavenda was born in New York City. After completing secondary school in North Adams, Massachusetts, he attended Clark University where he graduated cum laude in 1966 with a B.Sc in chemistry. Having passed the entrance examination for the doctoral program at the Weizmann Institute of Science, he began experimental work on enzymes under the direction of Ephraim Katzir, who was later to become the President of Israel. Realizing that he was not made out for experimental work, he came under the influence of Ephraim's brother, Aaron, after reading his book Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics in Biophysics, coauthored with Peter Curran. After the Six Days War, Aaron Katchalsky helped him secure a studentship for a doctoral degree in Ilya Prigogine's group in Brussels. =Doctoral thesis= His doctoral thesis, \\"Kinetic analysis and thermodynamic interpretation of nonequilibrium unstable transitions in open systems\\", showed that when homogeneous nonlinear chemical reactions far from equilibrium on the thermodynamic branch, which is an extension of the law of mass action at equilibrium, become unstable they make transitions to kinetic branches with lower entropy production than the thermodynamic branch. This result was initially contested by Prigogine who reasoned from hydrodynamic instabilities, like the Rayleigh-Benard instability, which show a larger entropy production beyond the critical point in order to maintain spatial structures. Prigogine later considered these spatial structures to be produced by unstable chemically diffusing systems, based on Alan Turing's morphological models, calling them 'dissipative structures' and for which Prigogine received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977. Prigogine later acknowledged that such transitions to lower states of entropy reduction were possible since no spatial structural changes were involved, and later incorporated Lavenda's work into a chapter of his new book Thermodynamic Theory of Structure, Stability, and Fluctuations, co-authored with Paul Glansdorff. After receiving his doctorate from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, with la plus grande distinction, he returned to Israel in 1970 to work as a post-doctoral student in the Physical Chemistry Department of the Hebrew University. During that period he published a short note in the Italian physics journal, Lettere Al Nuovo Cimento [3 (1972) 385-390] criticizing the Glansdorff-Prigogine universal criteria of evolution which attributes an inequality to a potential which is a function only of intensive variables, the forces. He pointed out that no such thermodynamic potential could exist for it would be devoid of all information regarding how large the system is, or how many particles it contains. The inequality would be a criterion of stability, but, on account of the assumption of local (stable) equilibrium of the components that the system is broken up into, the sum of stable components can hardly become unstable. The note would probably have gone unnoticed were it not for Peter Landsberg's citation of it in his Nature review of the Glansdorff-Prigogine book [P. T. Landsberg, \\"The fourth law of thermodynamics\\"Nature 238 (1972) 229-231 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v238/n5361/abs/238229a0.html], where he predicted \\"the occasional lack of lucidity in the book which may give rise to some discussion within the next few years\\". = Career = Consultancies After the murder of Aharon Katzir in Lod Airport massacre in May 1972, Lavenda accepted a position of consultant at Nuovo Pignone in Florence Italy together with a teaching position at the University of Pisa. Through the vice President of Nuovo Pignone, he came into contact with Vicenzo Gervasio who was later to become President of ENI Data, and the idea crystallized of setting up a company dedicated to the analysis and dynamic modeling of fouling processes in refineries and reactors. He established relations between ENI and Northwest Research, Boeing, and SERI (Solar Energy Research Institute). He helped form a new company within the ENI group, TEMA, which was supported by SNAM Progetti. While retaining an unpaid lectureship in Thermodynamics at the University of Naples, Lavenda published his critical appraisal of the then current theories of irreversible thermodynamics, Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, in 1978. It was originally published by the Macmillan Press and later became a Dover Classic of Science and Mathematics.  Camerino years  In 1980 he won a chair in Physical Chemistry. Transferring to Camerino, he was to spend more than three decades there. His first book during this period, \\"Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics\\", published by Wiley in 1985, developed the nonlinear generalization of the Onsager-Machlup formulation of nonequilibrium fluctuations which was restricted to linear (Gaussian) processes. Just as equilibrium is characterized by the state of maximum entropy, corresponding to maximum probability, nonequilibrium states are characterized by the principle of least dissipation of energy, corresponding to the maximum probability of a transition between nonequilibrium states that are not well-separated in time. This principle can be generalized to non-Gaussian fluctuations in the limit of small thermal noise and constitutes a kinetic analog to Boltzmann's principle. During a sabbatical year in 1986 in Porto Alegre, Lavenda had ample time to browse through the well-furnished library at the Universidade Federale di Rio Grande del Sud. He was impressed by the parallelism between statistical inference and statistical thermodynamics: two distinct and separate branches that are essentially working on the same problems but with no apparent connection. His work, summarized in Statistical Physics: A Probabilistic Approach, published by Wiley-Interscience in 1991, completes Boltzmann's principle, which expresses the entropy as the logarithm of a combinatorial factor, by showing that the entropy is the potential that determines Gauss’ law of error for which the average value is the most probable value. Just as there are frequency and degree- of-belief (Bayes' theorem) interpretations of statistical inference, the same should apply to statistical thermodynamics. The frequency interpretation applies to extensive variables, like energy and volume which can be sampled, while the degree-of-belief interpretations applies to the intensive variables, like temperature and pressure, for which sampling has no meaning. The connection between the two branches translates the Cramer-Rao inequality into thermodynamic uncertainty relations, analogous to quantum mechanical uncertainty relations, where the more knowledge we have about a thermodynamic variable the less we know about its conjugate. Since the lack of a probability distribution means the absence of its statistics, the possibility of an intermediate statistics, or what is referred to as parastatistics, between Bose–Einstein statistics and Fermi–Dirac statistics is nonexistent. Statistical thermodynamics is usually concerned with most probable behavior which becomes almost certainty if large enough samples are taken. But sometimes surprises are in store where extreme behavior becomes the prevalent one. Turning his attention to such rare events Lavenda published Thermodynamics of Extremes in 1995, whose real interest lies in the formulation of a thermodynamics of earthquakes that was subsequently published in Annali di Geofisica (Extreme value statistics and thermodynamics of earthquakes: \\"Large earthquakes\\";Annali di geofisica 43 (2000) 469-484 http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/1277 \\"aftershock sequences\\"Annali di geofisica43 (2000) 967-982 http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/1277), and which is gaining increasing attention. By properly defining entropy and energy, a temperature can be associated to an aftershock sequence giving it an additional means of characterization. A new magnitude-frequency relation is predicted which applies to clustered after-shocks in contrast to the [Gutenberg-Richter law] which treats them as independent and identically distributed random events. Attempts at forming a centre for thermodynamics In the nineties, Lavenda saw thermodynamics as a cultural heritage that could have a place in Italian society, and would be pertinent to both industrial research and to the preservation of its artistic patrimony. He was a proponent for the establishment of a National Centre of Thermodynamics for which financial funding was unavailable. Capturing the interest of the ENEA, or the Italian agency for alternative energy resources, he applied for funding in the European Commission of Human Capital and Mobility Programme. His project, \\"Thermodynamics of Complex Systems\\", came in sixth place in Chemistry section with maximum funding in 1992. This led to the formation of a European Thermodynamics Network consisting of 16 partners in the EU and Switzerland. It was later extended to the Eastern European Countries in the European Commission PECO Programme. This eventually led to the establishment of a National Centre for Thermodynamics that was brought into existence by the ENEA, but lasted only several months, because European funds were absorbed by other projects  Later years  Often critical of new fashions and modes in thermodynamics, Lavenda wrote A New Perspective on Thermodynamics,https://www.springer.com/mathematics/probability/book/978-1-4419-1429-3 published in 2009, by returning to Carnot's original conception that work can only be done when there is a difference in temperature, and the necessity of closing the cycle before that work can be assessed. More recently Lavenda has directed his interests to relativity by providing it with a new foundation based on non-Euclidean geometries. Rather than measuring distances in terms of the usual Euclidean metric, distances are defined in terms of what is known as a cross-ratio, a perspective invariant of four points, which, for the space of velocities, just happens to be the compounding of longitudinal Doppler shifts. Doppler shifts are fundamental to relativity: oblique Doppler shifts describe aberration, while second order ones describe length contraction, but rather than being in the direction of the motion are perpendicular to it. The uniformly rotating disc, which is considered by some to be the missing link in Einstein's formulation of general relativity, is exactly described by the hyperbolic metric in polar coordinates, named after the nineteenth century Italian geometer Eugenio Beltrami, which predicts the circumference of the disc to be greater when in motion than when it is at rest. Thus a uniformly rotating disc belongs to hyperbolic, and not Euclidean, space and so, too, does relativity.

It is an addition to the power usage effectiveness (PUE) definition and was first proposed by Greenqloud.GPUE – Green Power Usage Effectiveness - GreenQloud The Green Grid has developed the Power Usage Effectiveness metric The Green Grid - The Green Grid Data Center Power Efficiency Metrics: PUE and DCiE or PUE to measure a data centers' effectiveness of getting power to IT equipment. What the PUE tells in simple terms is how much extra energy is needed for each usable kWh for the IT equipment due to the power going into cooling, power distribution loss etc. and it’s a simple formula (in theory): PUE = Total Facility Power/IT Equipment Power The PUE can change depending on where measurements are made, when they are made and the timespan the measurements are made in. Data centers are subtracting factors from their PUE to lower it e.g. district heating. Some of the issues with PUE are being addressed with the PUEx definition.New PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) standards for data center energy efficiency GPUE is a way to \\"weigh\\" the PUE to better see which data centers are truly green in the sense that they indirectly cause the least amount of CO2 to be emitted by their use of sustainable or unsustainable energy sources. This new metric GPUE or Green Power Usage Effectiveness is defined as: GPUE = G × PUEx (for inline comparison of data centers) or = G @ PUEx (a better display and for CO2 emission calculations) The \\"G\\" is the key factor here and it is a simple calculated value: G = Weighed sum of energy sources and their lifecycle KG CO2/KWh G =∑( %EnergySource × ( 1 + weight) ) Adding 1 to the weight is to \\"weigh\\" (multiply) with the PUE to get a number that is comparable to PUE. The weights taken directly from the \\"lifecycle CO2/kWh for electricity generation by power source\\" table above we got from the 2008 Sovacool Study Benjamin K. Sovacool. A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia, Journal of Contemporary Asia, Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 386. e.g. the weight for unscrubbed coal is e.g. 1.050 (kg of CO2/kWh) while hydroelectric river generation has a weight of 0.013. An unknown energy source or a \\"mix\\" will get the same as the maximum value which for now is the same as coal. Example: PUE 1.20, 50/50 Coal/Hydro G = 0.5*(1+1.050) + 0.5*(1+0.013) G = 1.531, GPUEx = 1.84 or 1.531@1.20 Kg CO2 per usable kWh = (G-1) × PUEx = 0.64 kg See also * Power usage effectiveness (PUE) * Comparisons of life- cycle greenhouse gas emissions * Data center infrastructure efficiency * Performance per watt * Green computing * IT energy management References Category:Sustainable technologies Category:Computers and the environment Category:Benchmarks (computing) Category:Energy conservation Category:Electric power ","title":"Green Power Usage Effectiveness"},{"id":"29469940","title":"List of county routes in Franklin County, New York"},{"id":"29469945","text":"Roslyn National Bank and Trust Company Building is a historic commercial building located at Roslyn in Nassau County, New York.

It was first organized in July 1968 as an aviation group and stands as the most decorated aviation unit in the United States Army. It was redesignated an aviation brigade in 1986. It has served in almost every single military operation (combat, peacekeeping, and humanitarian) since the Vietnam War. In support of the Global War on Terror, the CAB has distinguished itself as the military's premiere combat aviation unit during its two deployments to Iraq (2003 and 2005) and five deployments to Afghanistan (2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2015). The brigade has flown hundreds of thousands of hours during these combat tours, transporting millions of troops around the battlefield and providing close air support/aerial reconnaissance. The 101st broke its own record for longest air assault in history during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Previously, the longest air assault was conducted in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm. Vietnam On 1 July 1968, at Camp Eagle in the Republic of Vietnam, the 160th Aviation Group was constituted with elements of the 2d Squadron, 17th Cavalry; the 101st Aviation Battalion (Assault Helicopter); the 158th Aviation Battalion (Assault Helicopter); and the 159th Aviation Battalion (Assault Helicopter). Less than a year later, on 25 June 1969, the 160th Aviation Group was redesignated as the 101st Aviation Group. Post-Vietnam reorganization On 15 August 1986, the 101st Aviation Group was redesignated as the Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/101avn.htm The Aviation Brigade was deployed to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The 101st fired the first shots of the Persian Gulf War from AH-64 Apaches under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Richard \\"Dick\\" Cody who would later serve as the 31st Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Through the 1990s, the brigade deployed elements to Somalia, Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Honduras to defend democracy and assist in hurricane relief operations. On 9 October 1997, the Aviation Brigade (the largest aviation brigade in the Army at the time) split its nine battalions into two brigades, the 101st Aviation Brigade (Attack) and the 159th Aviation Brigade (Assault). Upon return from its Iraq deployment, the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade was finally restructured to its current form. It now consists of a battalion of AH-64D Apache Longbows (1st Battalion), a battalion/squadron of OH-58D Kiowa Warriors (2/17th Cavalry), an assault battalion of UH-60M Black Hawks (5th Battalion), a general support battalion of CH-47F Chinooks, UH-60A Black Hawks, and UH-60L Black Hawks (6th Battalion), and an aviation support battalion (96th ASB). The 159th Aviation Brigade (Assault) underwent a similar transformation and was redesignated as the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade. The 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) was the only division in the US Army to have two aviation brigades. On 7 May 2015 the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade was inactivated at a ceremony at the Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Division Parade field, leaving only the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade in the division.https://www.army.mil/article/148298/159th_Combat_Aviation_Brigade_cases_colors_during_inactivation_ceremony Concurrently the 101st CAB was redesignated as the Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, bringing it in line with other divisional aviation brigades, which are not numbered. This reorganization resulted in the division having the same configuration as the 10th Mountain Division, a light infantry division. Along with the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade being inactivated, one of the most storied dustoff units in the United States Army history was inactivated as well, the division's \\"Eagle Dustoff.\\" During the 1990 Gulf War (Desert Shield/Desert Storm) Eagle Dustoff was deployed to the Saudi Arabian Theater of operations on 22 August 1990 and was the first US Army medevac unit in country. When Eagle Dustoff landed in Dhahran Saudi Arabia and was unloaded from a C-5A Galaxy, the unit immediately began taking missions with the evacuation of a US Marine with a broken leg. Throughout Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Eagle Dustoff transported and saved the lives of US military personnel, Saudi nationals and Iraqi enemy prisoners of war.Desert Shield/Desert Storm after action report. UH-60L from B Company (\\"Lancers\\"), 5th Battalion, on an air assault mission in Iraq Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom Beginning in January 2002, the brigade responded to the call to arms in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan following the attacks on 9/11. The 101st was the first conventional aviation asset deployed after 9/11. The 101st would support battalions of the 187th Infantry Regiment (part of the 3d Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division), fighting Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. In February 2003, the brigade was again alerted to deploy in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade crossed the berm into Iraq on 21 March 2003, to launch deep attacks, as well as guard the V Corps' western flank. The brigade facilitated the liberation of three major cities and the coalition forces' march on Baghdad. After the brigade's redeployment in the spring of 2004, it transformed into an effort to create a self-sustaining combat aviation brigade. Completely transformed, the brigade once again answered the nation's call in August 2005 and began its second deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Headquartered out of COB Speicher in Tikrit, the brigade provided full-spectrum aviation support to the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and its five brigade combat teams that were arrayed across 131,000 square kilometers of the Band of Brothers' area of operation. During this deployment, the 101st innovated a unique strategy dubbed Eagle Watch, using its aircraft to conduct effective vehicle interdictions using its UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and Pathfinders. In December 2007, the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, Task Force Destiny, deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Headquartered out of Bagram Airfield, the brigade task force provided full-spectrum aviation support to CJTF-82, CJTF-101, CJSOTF and International Security Assistance Force, covering an area of responsibility the size of Texas. Deploying to Afghanistan again, this time to Kandahar Airfield in February 2010 after having their dwell period cut short by four months, Task Force Destiny's arrival coincided with the anticipated introduction of the \\"surge\\" of forces announced by the commander in chief three months earlier. Task Force Shadow, stationed out of Kandahar along with Brigade HQ, provided support to all of RC South but most notably the 502nd Infantry Regiment as they secured the Arghandab River Valley. The Arghandab River Valley was the site of some of the toughest and bloodiest fighting since the war began in Afghanistan. Over the course of the combat deployment, TF Shadow (A co. 6-101, B co. 6-101, B co. 5-101, C co. 6-101, A & C trp. 2-17) conducted multiple combat operations, including reconnaissance, support of troops in contact, air assaults, combat resupply operations, support of Special Operations Forces, MEDEVAC, and many training flights in expanding current aviation capacity. Task Force Destiny Soldiers assisted the Shadow aviation units by conducted refueling at operating bases across the country 24 hours a day to ensure all supported ground forces retained flexibility in their operations. Current role and structure Since the brigade's restructuring in 2004, the CAB, 101st Airborne Division has become a self-sufficient aviation unit. It has successfully utilized the Task Force format in its 2008, 2010, and 2012 deployments to Afghanistan. In keeping with the traditions by the 101st Airborne Division of using card suits to distinguish subordinate units, the brigade is represented by the diamond (♦) on their helmets. The Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division currently consists of the following units: * Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) (Hell Cats) * 1st Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment (Expect No Mercy)  HHC (Avengers)  A Company (Spectres)  B Company (Bearcats)  C Company (Paladins)  D Company (Dragonslayers)  E Company (Executioners) B/101 Aviation Regiment (Archangels) * 5th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment (Eagle Assault)  HHC (Havoc)  A Company (Phoenix)  B Company (Lancers)  C Company (Phantoms)  D Company (Ghostriders)  E Company (Renegades) * 6th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment (Shadow of the Eagle)  HHC (Iron Eagles)  A Company (Warlords)  B Company (Pachyderms)  C Company (Shadow Dustoff)  D Company (Witchdoctors)  E Company (Trailblazers)  F Company (Sky Masters) * 2nd Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment (Out Front)  Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (HHT) (Headhunters)  A Troop (Annihilators)  B Troop (Banshee)  C Troop (Condors)  D Troop (Dirty Delta)  E Troop (Iron Horse)  F Troop (Firehawk) * 96th Aviation Support Battalion (96th ASB) (Troubleshooters) Headquarters and Support Company (HSC) (Warriors)  A Company (Roadrunners)  B Company (Big Ugly)  C Company (CIPHER) References External links *Official Homepage of the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade *'More missions, more contact' for Task Force Shadow *Heeding the call: Medevac crews in Afghanistan *101st AA's Historic Icons *5 101st Combat Aviation Brigade Soldiers killed in Afghan Helicopter Crash *Army Staff Sgt.

Sarmento de Beires became famous for piloting the first night-time aerial crossing of the Atlantic, in April 1927. The first night-time flight over the South Atlantic The first night aerial crossing over the South Atlantic (and part of North Atlantic) was going to be made in a Portuguese Army Aviation Dornier Do J Wal metallic seaplane, with two Lorraine-Dietrich 450 hp engines, baptized as Argos. The Argos crew included Sarmento de Beires (pilot), Duvalle Portugal (co-pilot), Jorge de Castilho (navigator) and Manuel Gouveia (mechanic). The Argos took off from the Tagus river near the Alverca military airbase, on the March 7, 1927 and arrived in Casablanca, Morocco on the same day. From Casablanca it flew to Bolama, Portuguese Guinea. In Bolama, technical problems prevented the takeoff and the pilot Duvalle sacrificed himself, standing on the ground to ease the weight of the aircraft and allow the continuation of the journey. After other problems, Argos took off on April 16 at 18:08, heading to Brazil. Due to engine problems, the mechanic Gouveia needed to intervene twice, saving the flight. The navigator Castilho guided the aircraft to the Brazilian Rocks of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, from which she flew to Fernando de Noronha island, where they arrived at 12:20 h, totaling 2,595 kilometers on an 18-hour, 12-minute flight. Received by the warden on the island, he shouted: \\"We did not know anything! Further more, the planes do not usually arrive by air in Fernando Noronha.\\" The flight continued with stops in Recife, Natal and Rio de Janeiro. In the latter city, Beires recorded in his diary:We have a great record, 14 speeches in 12 hours. From Portugal, arrives a telegram with congratulations signed by Gago Coutinho.

A wide range of mammals, birds and fish have been kept as ornamental animals. Ornamental animals have often formed the basis of introduced populations, sometimes with negative ecological effects, but a history of being kept as ornamental animals has also preserved breeds, types and even species which have become rare or extinct elsewhere. This article does not cover animals kept in zoos, wildfowl collections or aquaria. History Ornamental animals have been kept for many centuries in several cultures. Introduced species Some ornamental animals have escaped from captivity and have formed feral populations. Conservation A number of animals have been protected from local or worldwide extinction by being kept as ornamental animals. List of ornamental animals The following are breeds or species whose history has included a significant period as ornamental animals, either globally or in particular regions (animals kept primarily in modern zoos, aquaria or waterfowl collections are not included): =Deer= *Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus). Became extinct in the wild before 1900, but survived in the park of the Chinese Emperor near Peking. Died out there too, but survived in Woburn Park in England. Now reintroduced to the wild in China. *Reeves's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi). Escaped from Woburn Park in England, and now established as a feral animal throughout much of lowland England, causing considerable damage to native woodland. *Sika (Cervus nippon). Established in the UK and other places from park escapes. Poses a hybridisation threat to other deer species such as Red Deer Cervus elephas. *Water deer (Hydropotes inermis). Another species which has escaped from Woburn Park, having a feral population in the surrounding area of England. =Cattle= *British White. White cattle with red or black ears were kept in parks in Britain and Ireland over many hundreds of years. Polled (hornless) herds and individuals of these formed the basis of the usually black-eared British White. *Galloway. Polled, woolly cattle, originally from Scotland but also often kept as park animals in Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries, especially as colour forms such as the Belted Galloway. *White Park. A white, usually black-eared beef breed derived from horned herds and individuals of the British park cattle. Chillingham. A red-eared type of White Park which lives only as a feral animal at Chillingham Castle in northern England (and at one other site). Vaynol. A black-eared type of White Park recognised as a separate rare breed, from the Vaynol estate in North Wales. =Sheep= *Black Welsh Mountain. A colour variety of Welsh Mountain Sheep, with a history as an ornamental animal. *Castlemilk Moorit. A short-tailed breed of sheep, developed in Scotland as an ornamental animal from crosses of other breeds and wild sheep. *Hebridean. A black, short-tailed breed of sheep, often multi- horned. It is derived from multi-coloured sheep kept in the Hebrides since the Iron Age, which became extinct there in the late 19th century. A population survived in parks in England and Scotland, where they became always black, probably from cross-breeding with another ornamental breed, Jacob sheep. *Jacob. A pied, often multi-horned breed of sheep which was kept in parks in England for several centuries. Unrelated to other British sheep, but of uncertain origin. =Goats= *Bagot. A small, pied goat with large horns, kept at Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire, England, reputedly since the Middle Ages, and probably derived originally from similar goats from the Rhone region of Switzerland and France. =Other mammals= *Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Introduced as an ornamental animal to England and other places, and established as a feral animal; implicated in the steep decline in mainland Great Britain of the native Red Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). *Red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus). Escaped or introduced to various areas in the United Kingdom, France and New Zealand.

After a moult the larva works itself to the upper surface of the leaf and begins to make a blotch and soon after a tentiform mine running along the midrib. The mine contracts very strongly, causing the epidermis to develop strong folds, and the leaf to double, almost concealing the mine.

The ship was named after the Swedish coastal city of Sundsvall. Sundsvall was laid down in 1942 during the Second World War, and was commissioned on 17 September 1943. She survived the war, and was modified and redesigned as a frigate in 1965. She was kept in service by the Swedish Navy until 1982, and was then used for testing of the Navy's RBS-15 anti-ship missile. The ship was later sold to Spain for scrapping. Design Sundsvall was 97.5 meters long and 9.2 meters wide. The hull was made of steel while the superstructures were constructed of light metal. The main superstructure was just forward of midships and housed among other the galley, wheelhouse and navigation bridge and the command bridge. The machine consisted of three Penhoët A oil-fired boilers which generated steam for two of the de Laval steam turbines of 36,000 horsepower, which in turn drove two propellers. This machinery gave the ships a maximum speed of 39 knots. The main artillery consisted of three 12 cm guns and the air defense consisted of eight 40 mm anti-aircraft automatic cannon m/36. In addition, there were anti-aircraft machine guns and torpedo tubes, and more than 40 mines and 16 depth charges could be carried. History Sundsvall was built at Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad in Gothenburg and was launched on 20 October 1942 and was delivered to the Swedish Navy on 17 September 1943. After delivery, Sundsvall was put into the Coastal Fleet, where she served during the rest of World War II. =Conversion= In the mid 1960s, Sundsvall underwent extensive rebuilding. The foeward and aft 12 cm gun was replaced by a 57 mm anti-aircraft automatic gun m/50D and the third was removed and replaced by a 37.5 cm anti-submarine rocket launcher. Additionally, two more rack-deployed depth charges m/33 were added and the mining capacity was extended to 130 mines. A helicopter platform was built and a new fire-control system was installed with a new radar antenna in a radome on the bridge deck. In 1965 the ship was reclassified to frigate and in 1966 the conversion was completed. =Fate= Sundsvall was decommissioned on 1 July 1982, after which she was used as a target ship for test firing with RBS-15 before she was sold for scrap in Spain in 1984.

Towards the end of the 1970s its building (510 Queens Street) proved too small and it moved to the town hall, and was often referred to as the Town Hall AoG Origins While this church had roots in the early days of the pentecostal revivals in New Zealand, real growth began around 1965 with the ministry of Bob and Noelle Midgley. The 1970s When the Midgleys left for further work overseas in December 1970, Neville Johnson became the new senior pastor.Clark p133 The work continued to experience growth seeing “amazing acts of healing and greatly increased attendances”Carew p28 Growth occurred in all areas. Missionary work flourished under the leadership of John Watson, with outposts in Asia, Africa and South America. At one stage over 60% of the church income was spent on missions.Clark p186 The church was known for vibrant music, producing some recordings of live worship. Youth work flourished. An effective Bible School the Zion Bible Training Centre was established. People were attracted from all over Australasia to Neville's teaching. He was a proponent of the “Covering” or “Submission” theology and totally opposed to divorce and remarriage.Carew p27 Other teaching themes included victorious living and a strong emphasis on applications of the Old Testament. The 1980s Difficult times followed the resignation of Neville Johnson from the church on 27 April 1983. The reasons given in a prepared public statement were 'misuse of office, and immoral, improper and deceitful conduct'. Such was the ambiguity and lack of clarity of the situation that many continued to give to Neville for months to come believing he had done nothing wrong.Clark p185 In the light of potential impact on the denomination as a whole, Jim Williams (the General Superintendent of the AoG at the time) wrote to every AoG pastor in the country. Attendances fell from 2,500 to around 1000. Income also fell. Mission work was scaled back (with many workers finding other supporters) and the Zion Bible Training Centre had to close.

It was first described by Johan Wilhelm Zetterstedt in 1839. Description The wingspan is 10–12 mm. There is one generation per year, with adults on wing in June. The larvae feed on mountain willow (Salix arbuscula), tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia), and Salix silesiaca, mining the leaves of their host plant. Young larvae make a distinctly folded lower-surface tentiform mine. After some time, this mine is vacated and the larva lives freely in a leaf margin that has been folded downwards and is secured with silk. In small leaves the two halves are simply spun together in a pod. Two of these leaf folds are made and eaten out. Distribution The moth is found from Fennoscandia and northern Russia to the Pyrenees, Italy and Romania and from Scotland to Ukraine.

The names of these ships reflect the Royal Arms of Scotland and its central motif of the Lion Rampant. The two Lions of James IV Lion was commanded by brothers Sir Robert Barton and Sir Andrew Barton and captured by the English in 1511. The ship did not belong to the king but was fitted out for warfare by the Barton brothers. She was around 120 tons with a crew of forty, and probably the largest merchant ship used and hired by James IV of Scotland; small in comparison the king's Margaret and Great Michael.Macdougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell (1997), 235-6. Robert Barton took James IV of Scotland to the Isle of May in Lion in September 1506.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 3, (1901), 204, 342. Andrew Barton took Lion and the small Jennet of Purwyn, (which was a captured Danish ship) close to England in June 1511. He was acting with a royal Letter of Marque, which was a license to plunder Portuguese ships. Both ships were captured by Sir Edward and Sir Thomas Howard and taken to Blackwall. Andrew Barton was killed during their capture. Robert Barton provided a new larger replacement Lion of 300 tons.Macdougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell, (1997), 240-242.

The Lion was part of the fleet that James V took to France in 1536 and brought back Madeleine of Valois in 1537. Known as Great Lion, she and Salamander were fitted with 15 large wheeled guns and 10 smaller wheeled guns in May 1540, for the king's voyage to Orkney in June.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (1907), 353, 356, 421 John Barton sailed to Dieppe with Great Lion and Salamander in June 1541, and had their 27 guns cleaned and the latter ship re-rigged.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (1909), 465.

David Lindsay of the Mount, David Paniter, Sir John Campbell of Lundy, and Marco Grimani, Patriarch of Aquileia were rumoured to be passengers.

Odet de Selve, the French ambassador in London gained a detailed account from Nicolas d'Arfeville, a French painter and cartographer. Dudley was 30 miles from Yarmouth when he saw Great Lion, with Lioness, Mary Gallant and another unnamed Scottish ship on Tuesday 7 March 1547. Great Lion was overwhelmed by superior firepower, and the others surrendered, excepting the unnamed ship. The badly damaged Lion was lost while being towed to Yarmouth when she grounded on a sandbank. Those on board were brought as prisoners to the Tower of London, and at least one notable passenger was killed in the firefight.Correspondance Politique de Odet de Selve, (1888), 76, 117-119 Mary, Queen of Scots sued for the release of one passenger, the diplomat Thomas Erskine Commendator of DryburghCalendar of State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.7 no.15 Lioness; during the Scottish lifetime of Great Lion there appears to have been another ship called Lion in the Scots navy. This was probably Lioness, described by de Selve as of similar size to Mary Gallant, between 100 and 300 tons. The private Lion of Leith and privateer Mary of Guise also hired a private ship, called Lion in August 1554 to attack Borve Castle, Sutherland held by Iye Du Mackay. Sir Hew Kennedy of Girvanmains embarked 50 men of war and the royal gunner Hans Cochrane with a cannon.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 10 (1913), 233-4. On New Year's Day 1560 this Lion captured a Portuguese merchant ship carrying cloth near the Isle of Wight; and later another carrying sugar and olives; Our Lady of Consolation of Oporto carrying figs; and Saint Anthony of Aviero laden with salt. The partners in this adventure and the Captain, John Edmondstone, fell out over the proceeds and brought the case to the court of the Lord High Admiral of Scotland, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. They produced a letter of marque dating to the time of James IV belonging to Robert Logan of Restalrig. A year later, another Captain of the Lion, Patrick Blackadder, came to the court on 13 May 1561, this time for two Portuguese ships carrying sugar, Peter and Holy Spirit, captured in the Wash in April 1561. Blackadder produced the captured Portuguese sailors and the original letter of marque given to Andrew Barton on 20 November 1506.

Surprisingly little Catholic imaginative literature is explicitly religious; even less is devotional. Most of it touches on religious themes indirectly while addressing other subjects—not sacred topics but profane ones, such as love, war, family, violence, sex, mortality, money, and power. What makes the writing Catholic is that the treatment of these subjects is permeated with a particular worldview.\\" Gioia, Dana. \\"The Catholic Writer Today\\", First Things, December 2013 Professor Dana Gioia mentions various types of Catholic writers: practicing Catholics, and cultural Catholics, \\"writers who were raised in the faith and often educated in Catholic schools. Cultural Catholics usually made no dramatic exit from the Church but instead gradually drifted away.\\" There are also writers who have converted to Catholicism. A separate group are \\"...anti-Catholic Catholics, writers who have broken with the Church but remain obsessed with its failings and injustices, both genuine and imaginary.\\" The latter are not, strictly speaking, \\"Catholic writers\\", having rejected traditional Catholic viewpoints and practices. According to editor Joshua Hren, \\"Catholic writers tend to see humanity struggling in a fallen world. They combine a longing for grace and redemption with a deep sense of human imperfection and sin. Evil exists, but the physical world is not evil. Nature is sacramental, shimmering with signs of sacred things. Indeed, all reality is mysteriously charged with the invisible presence of God. Catholics perceive suffering as redemptive, at least when borne in emulation of Christ’s passion and death.\\"Hren, Joshua. \\"Can Catholic literature build on its rich heritage?\\", America, October 23, 2018 History Orestes Brownson converted from Transcendentalism to Catholicism in 1844; his views held much in common with the Liberal Catholicism of Charles de Montalembert, and periodically got him in trouble, sometimes with the Catholic hierarchy.Thorp, Willard (1978).

He published Brownson's Quarterly Review, a Catholic journal of opinion, including many reviews of \\"inspirational novels\\". Throughout the 19th century Irish-American novelist commentated on the treatment of Irish immigrant communities. Novels produced throughout the period were often based the continued social prejudices which these communities endured. Works such as Peter McCorry's Mount Benedict, included violence directed at Irish immigrants and the links the violence to the shown in Charleston and the \\"attempted wreckings in the north of Ireland.” which occurred in unison during the 1830s and 1840s. In the years after the American Civil War, a young priest by the name of Fr. Isaac Hecker traveled around giving lectures with the aim of evangelizing both Catholics and non-Catholics alike. In 1865, Fr. Hecker started a periodical which he named the Catholic World and in 1867 he founded the Catholic Publication Society to help publish and distribute them on a national level. Brownson wrote a number of articles for the Catholic World. In 1927, there was a growing curiosity toward the Catholic culture among the faith community. As Catholic literature was more readily accepted, more and more pieces of literature with Catholic themes and subjects were published. The mid-twentieth century saw a number of Catholic writers prominent in American literature, such as Paul Horgan, Edwin O'Connor, Henry Morton Robinson, Caroline Gordon, and poet Phyllis McGinley. Between 1945 and 1965, Catholic novelists and poets received eleven Pulitzer Prizes and five National Book Awards. J. F. Powers was an American novelist and short-story writer whose work has long been admired for its gentle satire and its ability to recreate with a few words the insular but gradually changing world of post-World War II American Catholicism. He is known for having captured a \\"clerical idiom\\" in postwar North America. His story \\"The Valiant Woman\\" received the O. Henry Award in 1947.

Life Athanase Jean, better known by the name of Doctor Jean, was born on 24 November 1861 at Saint-Cesaire, Charente-Maritime, into a family of winemakers. Having done well at his studies undertaken in Pons, Saintes and Rochefort and ending up specialising in naval health, he found himself posted to Guyana for his military service. It was there that he began practising medicine. On his return to France, he was able to complete his university degree. He was subsequently asked by the residents of Rouffiac to become their local doctor, a post that he kept until his death on 17 February 1932. An enthusiastic man and curious about everything, he kept his peasant roots at heart and showed a talent for speaking and writing about the Saintonge using the local dialect. This resulted in several works, the most relevant and most popular of which was undoubtedly \\"La Mérine à Nastasie\\", a comedy in three acts in Saintongeais, and published under the pseudonym of Yan San Acer (Saint-Acer being the Saintonge name of his birthplace, Saint-Césaire ). It was performed for the first time on 25 May 1902 at the Chateau de Mauleon in Rouffiac. On 4 December of the same year it made its début in Paris at the Salle Lancry. It has been reprised on various occasions throughout the twentieth century. As well as working tirelessly as doctor, he also took part in local government serving on the municipal council and serving as mayor and councillor for the town of Pons. He worked to promote the revival of the local vineyard after its destruction by phylloxera, and was instrumental in having a railway station built to serve the village using the receipts from the first performance of his play \\"La Mérine à Nastasie\\". He was also responsible for bringing the telephone to the commune. Like Barthélemy Gautier, well known for his sketches of peasant life, \\"Doctor Jean\\" will remain with Evariste Poitevin and Odette Comandon as one of the principal names associated with Saintonge culture.

The museum is devoted to presenting and preserving the collection of the American artist William Henry Singer (1868–1943) and his wife Anna (1878–1962). Laren School Singer museum and sculpture De Zwanen in Laren, June 2006 Singer museum, April 2012 William Henry Singer was the son of a steel baron of the same name who sold his company Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Co. to Andrew Carnegie. Against the wishes of his father, young Singer became an artist and after marrying Anna Spencer-Brugh in 1895, he moved to Monhegan, Maine to join the artist colony there. His father was disappointed that he chose art rather than business and insisted he earn his living as an artist. His seascapes sold well, however, and together with the artist Martin Borgord, the couple traveled to Paris where they studied art at the Académie Julian in 1901.William H. Singer, Jr. (1868–1943) by Robert E. Prezler, Washington County of Fine Arts Attracted by the artist colony in Laren, made famous by the Dutch painters Jozef Israëls, Anton Mauve, Jacob Maris, Albert Neuhuys, and their pupils such as Matthijs Maris, Arina Hugenholtz, they decided to settle there. They were not the first foreigners to visit the artist colony in Laren; Max Liebermann, who often spent summers painting in the Netherlands, visited in the company of Isaac Israëls, Josef's son. The Singers knew them and others such as the pointillists Co Breman & Ferdinand Hart Nibbrig. They remained special friends with Martin Borgord, with whom they traveled to Norway. Other close friends were the painters Walter Griffin, Henri Le Sidaner and Jacob & Willem Dooijewaard. In 1954 Singer's widow founded the Singer Memorial Foundation, and in 1956 the museum designed by the Dutch architect Wouter Hamdorff (1890 - 1965) was opened in an expansion of their home, \\"De Wilde Zwanen,\\"on the Oude Drift, with a new concert hall attached. An architecture competition for reconstruction of the complex was organized in 2012. The winners —young architects Sanne Oomen and denieuwegeneratie—were commissioned the project. The final design was prepared by Oomen Ontwerpt, Oscar Vos and Thomas Dieben (denieuwegeneratie, later KRFT) in collaboration with VDNDP architecten. Reconstruction was completed in 2017. The museum hosts the Singer collection of paintings and sculpture and artifacts, by members of the Laren School, the Hague School (Pulchri Studio), and Bergen School (art), and also has examples of Expressionism. Some of the more prominent names in the collection acquired since 1956, are Bart van der Leck, Jan Sluijters, Leo Gestel, Chris Beekman, Jan Toorop, Mommie Schwarz, Mommie's wife Else Berg, Gustave De Smet and Herman Kruyder.Museum website The museum has a café and hosts regular visiting art exhibitions.

The lake dried up in 1993 and remained dry for years until heavy rains in August 2010, filled the lake to near full supply level. During this dry period, two levees were built across the lake dividing it into three sections. Only the smallest section near the Callington Mill was able to remain full.

Main scientific results A unique method for proving the Pontryagin principle, as well as second order necessary and sufficient conditions for a wide class of optimal control problems with various constraints was elaborated. The suggested method allows to overcome some principal difficulties arising at application of the known methods. Availability of delays in controls that a priori are not supposed to be commensurable, absence of a priori supposition on normality of the extremal under investigation, existence of phase restraints, undifferentiable time dependence of right sides of the equations whose end moment is not supposed to be fixed, are among such difficulties. New optimality conditions of second order were obtained for singular controls in the systems with delays. New stronger necessary optimality conditions of first and second order were obtained for a wider class of optimal control problems in discrete systems. Pedagogical activity In 1973-1998 gave lectures at mechanics mathematics faculty of BSU on analytic geometry, differential faculty of BSU on analytic geometry, differential geometry and mathematical methods of optimal control. At the same time he has given lectures at specialty courses on optimal control and conducted seminars, supervised diploma works of students. M.

The story of the character spans from that point to the death of the human race during an atomic holocaust, a space journey, the establishment of the human race on another planet and his eventual return to earth. The comic book was first published in 1969.  Creation  Gilgamesh was initially created in 1969 by Lucho Olivera as a single story, but its good reception turned it into a regular publication. Olivera worked initially at both the drawings and the scripts, but he later left his scriptwriting duties to Sergio Mulko, who was working by then under the pseudonym Leo Gioser. Mulko wrote with a higher emphasis on the psychology and motivations of the character. The series was relaunched in 1980, with the scripts of Robin Wood. Wood was later replaced by Ricardo Ferrari and Alfredo Julio Grassi. Lucho Olivera stayed working with the drawings during all of the editorial history of the character.  Plot  Gilgamesh was presented as a prince and later king of the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk, worried about his death. He thought that, as a king, he should be beyond death, to be able to protect his population forever. Then he saw the fall of an alien spaceship, and met the sole alien inside it. In a twist of the Epic of Gilgamesh, that alien is named Utnapishtim. Gilgamesh saves his life by following his instructions to use the alien technology to restore him his immortality, and is allowed to repeat the same process on himself as a reward. The character becomes immortal, never aging and impossible to kill. He stayed as King, but found that his population was increasingly sad and refusing any activity, as his immortality reminded them of their own mortality. He staged his death and left the city, which as a result became active again. From that point, he became an errant. The comic book depicts his many adventures at ancient civilizations or historical events, or the meeting of historical people like Jesus or Napoleon. He also met fictional creatures, such as vampires or Atlanteans, and other characters created by the authors. The overall theme is his displeasure of human mortality, his rejection of warfare and, in later stories, his own desire for death. The human race dies during the explosion of a nuclear plant, reflecting the fears caused by the contemporary Chernobyl disaster. However, another character presented in earlier stories was already aware of the risk and the existence of Gilgamesh, and developed a plan: a spaceship with preserved human embryos, that Gilgamesh would take across the space and restore the human race at another planet. He rejected the plan then, but carries it out after the explosion. He met other alien races, and eventually settles at another planet. The embryos become a tribe and, centuries later, a technologically advanced society. This new human race, unaware of being alien to that planet, organizes a space journey to planet earth, after discovering life in it. Gilgamesh joins it, but the expedition dies during an accident after arriving. Gilgamesh is then left alone in a devastated planet. He eventually meet other aliens that preserved human life in a similar manner, and would restore the human race when radiation had lowered to allow life again. Another alien race establishes itself on earth, but is followed by an enemy ship and destroyed. Gilgamesh kills the single attacking alien, but realizes that the action was observed by others of his race. Fearing a counter-attack that would be devastating for the small human tribe, he took the ship and attempted to take the fight to the space. He met an alien post on Mars, of the same race of the aliens that gave him immortality, and they destroy the whole attacking fleet. Gilgamesh is sent by them to another level of existence, similar to the Olympus, where he met other immortal people, with him being the only immortal that was mortal once. He is proposed to move to yet another higher level of existence, but requests instead to live his life again. This event relates with the relaunch of the series mentioned earlier.

It is a deep-sounding slit drum, traditionally made out of a hollow tree trunk. It is beaten with sticks, and can produce a small range of bass notes. Lokole in pop music While the lokole has been occasionally employed in modern Congolese music at least since the 1940s, it became prominent in Zairean pop music during the Authenticité campaign (1960s-1970s) that sought to preserve and rediscover the Congolese tradition as opposed to imported, Western habits. It was most notably Zairean singer Papa Wemba who endorsed lokole as an integral part of the sound of his bands, two of which (Isifi Lokole and Yoka Lokole) were actually named after this drum. In the late 1970s, Wemba's band Viva La Musica brought the lokole to the attention of an international audience.

Forensic examination of the bullets left at the various scenes confirmed that all of the shots were from the same rifle. Incidents The first shooting was aimed at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Virginia on October 16, when bullets from a high- velocity rifle penetrated the atrium skylight. On October 19, 2010 shortly before 5 a.m., an unidentified gunman shot at the south side of The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, shattering, but not penetrating windows on the third and fourth floors. The offices behind those windows were vacant due to renovations. The Pentagon Reservation was locked down as authorities swept the area for evidence, and the building was reopened about 5:40 a.m. The Joint Terrorism Task Force is leading the investigation into the incident. Then the shooter attacked the Marine Corps Museum again on October 29. The same rifle was used to attack a Marine Corps recruiting center in Chantilly, Virginia on October 26. This series of attacks prompted the organizers of the October 31, 2010 Marine Corps Marathon to upgrade security precautions, which proceeded without incident. On November 3, authorities announced that the same rifle was used to shoot at a United States Coast Guard recruiting center in Woodbridge, Virginia on late November 1 or early November 2. Suspect The person behind the attacks remained unknown until June 17, 2011 when Yonathan Melaku, a 22-year-old naturalized American from Ethiopia and Marine Corps Reserve Lance Corporal, was found at Arlington National Cemetery while it was closed. He was arrested by two officers from the U.S. Park Police. A search of his backpack revealed that he was carrying spent shell casings, a notebook containing references to the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, and plastic bags filled with ammonium nitrate, a common component of homemade explosives. He had no identification on him at the time of his arrest. He also left his rental vehicle parked in the woods near the Pentagon. The U.S. Park Police obtained a copy of the rental contract from the information affixed to the car key. The contract had his name listed. The U.S. Park Police conducted name check of his name for a Virginia drivers license. Once police obtained a drivers license number, the Park Police obtained his license photograph. After the Park Police informed him of his name, date of birth, social security number, and address, he confessed to his crimes. He had also been recently charged with breaking into 27 cars in suburban Washington. The investigation of the incident connected Melaku to the shootings, and on June 23, 2011, he was charged with two counts of willfully injuring the property of the United States, for which he faces up to 20 years in prison, and two counts of using a firearm during a violent crime, for which he faces up to a life sentence, with more charges possible.Pentagon suspect charged with shooting at military buildings The Federal Bureau of Investigation worked with the Fairfax County Police, the Prince William County police and the Pentagon Force Protection Agency to investigate the case. On January 11, 2013, Melaku was sentenced to 25 years in prison. This sentence was the outcome of a plea deal; afterward, Melaku retained new counsel and was diagnosed with schizophrenia, but decided to stick with the plea deal.

It recounts the story of an infamous marriage scandal that took place during the Victorian era in Ireland and the United Kingdom, known as the Yelverton Case. It was greatly publicized in the press of the day, echoing the mass media coverage that is common today. Plot summary It was a chance meeting on a steamboat in 1852 between a young woman of nineteen named Theresa Longworth and a soldier in his thirties Charles Yelverton, heir to the title of Viscount Avonmore. After a five-year clandestine romance hidden from the public eye, the affair blossomed until they finally got married in secret in Edinburgh. The following summer they remarried in Dublin again in secret but in the presence of a priest. This was at the request of Theresa who was a Roman Catholic while Charles Yelverton had been brought up a Protestant. The validity of the marriage was later questioned in court. Characters The source of her novel Martyrs of Circumstance written by Theresa later on in life, they were unable to live together following the Irish wedding as husband and wife. When Charles later married another woman, Theresa felt compelled to take him to court for bigamy in an attempt to prove that they had been officially married. A number of trials took place over the following years in Dublin, Edinburgh and in London at the House of Lords, and generated a large public interest through the media coverage that such a scandal solicited. Every detail of the case was reported in the newspapers and the interest generated novels written by writers such as Wilkie Collins as well as ballads written and dedicated to the plea of Theresa. Victorian press coverage Having suffered greatly from the public exposure and scandal that resulted from the press coverage, Theresa’s dream of living a happy married life was impossible in the Victorian age. Therefore, she embarked on a journey that would take her around the world during which she wrote numerous novels about her travels and experiences. She notably met a young John Muir in the Yosemite of the late 19th century. Her accounts opened the door for independent women to travel in the twentieth century.

It has four hectares and is located in the northern area of the city, in Bulnes Avenue, and between the streets Francisco Bilbao and Angamos. There are three entrances: the main entrance is in Bulnes Avenue, and two other entrances are in Francisco Bilbao and Angamos streets. Since the cemetery had long ago reached its capacity, it has been supplemented and largely replaced by a controversial newer cemetery further to the north of the city, though the earlier site retains its status as a \\"monument cemetery.\\" The cemetery has been ranked by CNN as one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world. It was designated a National Monument of Chile in 2012.  Origins  Under the administration of the Governor Manuel Señoret, the cemetery was inaugurated on 9 April 1894. This saint field was built in order to replace the old one, which was located where José de los Santos Mardones Square is today. The area was donated by the pioneer Sara Braun and in 1919 the engineer Fortunato Circutti designed the whole portico and walls that surround the cemetery.[needs to be re-written in proper English]  Important Characters  Relevant figures in the history of Punta Arenas are buried in the cemetery of that city. It is important to mention the chapels of the great families of that epoch such as Menèndez-Behety, Braun Hamburger, Blanchard, Greenshields, Kusanovic and Menèndez-Montes. Menèndez-Behety was one of the most influential families during that time and they founded several companies and acquired large tracts of land in the Chilean Patagonia. Antonio Soto, one of the leaders of the Patagonia Rebelde labor uprising in Argentina, is also buried in the cemetery. Charles Amherst Milward, a British sailor and the inspiration behind Bruce Chatwin's travel classic In Patagonia, is buried here.  The Legends of the Cemetery  The cemetery of Punta Arenas is well known because of its attractive legends that transform the place into a magical environment of mystery. Some of the urban legends associated with the site are: * When Sara Braun gave everything for building the entrance of the cemetery, she asked for something. After her death, the central door of the cemetery had to be closed forever. Nowadays, that door is still closed and has not been opened since Sara Braun's death. Another legend about Braun is that she is uninterred each year on 1 November to have her makeup redone and hair styled. * Another known legend of the cemetery is the one concerning the “Indio Desconocido”. Everything started in 1930 when an Indian died in the Island called [Diego de Almagro IslandDiego de Almagro . The Indian was buried in the cemetery due to a donation from the administration of the same place. After twenty years, someone discovered several candles and coins around the grave. The years passed by and in 1968 the grave were plenty of papers demonstrating gratitude for being helped by the Indian. Moreover, a woman named Magdalena Vrsalovic decided to donate the coins, in order to help the Cruz Roja of Punta Arenas, a Chilean Institution that helps the community in case of difficulties. Therefore, Magdalena and other people agreed to build a monumental grave with the figure of the Indian made by Edmundo Casanova.

The vessel sailed overnight between the Polish city of Gdańsk and Nynäshamn in Sweden. Rigel II is the first of two sister ships built. The second vessel currently operates for SNAV as . History The vessel was launched in January 1980 as Visby for Rederi AB Gotland. She was the first of two identical ships built by Öresundsvarvet in Landskrona. Visby entered service between Gotland and the Swedish mainland ports of Nynäshamn and Oskarshamn. In 1987 the contract to run ferry services to Gotland was awarded to Gotlandslinjen. Visby was chartered to the new operator until replaced by Nord Gotlandia in 1990. In 1990 Visby was chartered to United Kingdom-based ferry operator Sealink British Ferries for service between Fishguard and Rosslare. Following a major refit in Tilbury the vessel entered service in March 1990 as Felicity. She remained the largest ferry on the Irish Sea until the arrival of Isle of Innisfree in 1995. Felicity was renamed Stena Felicity in 1991 following the acquisition of Sealink British Ferries by Stena Line. Stena Felicitys cinema was on one of the lowest deck, and close to the centre of the vessel between port and starboard, fore and aft. Adjacent were separate male and female saunas with Jacuzzis. Either was an ideal place to cross the St George's Channel in stormy weather because, being so low down and close to the centre of the ship, the rough sea state had very little effect. In 1997 the charter of Stena Felicity ended. Her place on the Fishguard route was taken by Koningin Beatrix. Following a rebuild in Germany, the vessel re- entered Gotland service in 1998 under her original name of Visby. In 2003 Visby was renamed Visborg to release her name for a new vessel under construction in China. In 2003 she was sold to Polferries and renamed Scandinavia for service between Gdańsk and Nynäshamn. The vessel's last trip between Nynäshamn and Gdańsk took place on 8 May 2015. The ship was sold to Ventouris Ferries and renamed to Rigel II.

Originally, the Ommegang was the largest lustral procession of Brussels, which took place once a year, on the Sunday before Pentecost. Since 1930, it has taken the form of a historical reenactment of the Joyous Entry of Emperor Charles V and his son Philip II in Brussels in 1549. As such, it joins the tradition of the great processions of notable riders and giants that are found everywhere in Belgium and northern France. Nowadays, the event takes place twice a year, at the turn of June and July. It is organised by Ommegang Oppidi Bruxellensis, an association close to the City of Brussels. Its starting point is in the Sablon/Zavel district in the historic centre of Brussels and it ends with a large spectacle at the Grand Place. Etymology The Dutch term Ommegang (originally spelled Ommeganck) means \\"moving around\\" or \\"walking around\\" (the church, village or city) and it is an old historical evocation of Brussels' largest lustral procession, which took place once a year, on the Sunday before Pentecost.. The annual Ommegang in Brussels was originally a Christian procession which gradually acquired a more secular character. The term thus evoked the act of \\"circumambulation\\" around a religious symbol, in Latin or , which can be found in many religions and beliefs. History =Origins (–1785)= According to legend, the origin of the Ommegang of Brussels goes back to a local devout woman named Beatrijs Soetkens. She had a vision in which the Virgin Mary instructed her to steal the miraculous statue of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw op ‘t Stocxken (\\"Our Lady on the little stick\\") in Antwerp, bring it to Brussels, and place it in the chapel of the Crossbowmen's Guild in the Sablon/Zavel district. The woman stole the statue, and through a series of miraculous events, was able to transport it to Brussels by boat in 1348. It was then solemnly placed in the chapel and venerated as the patron of the Guild. The Guild also promised to hold an annual procession, called an Ommegang, in which the statue was carried through Brussels. Through the following decades, what was originally a religious procession took on gradually a more worldly outlook. The Ommegang of 1549 corresponds to a golden age of the procession. From the mid-16th century, the Ommegang not only celebrated the miraculous legend, but became intertwined with the Joyous Entry of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. The Ommegang thus developed into an important religious and civil event in Brussels' annual calendar.Rudi Schrever, Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ter- Zavelkerk in Brussel'' During the second half of the 16th century, the event was dependent on political and religious upheavals in the Spanish Low Countries. Between 1580 and 1585, when the city was in the hands of the Protestants, the procession was simply suppressed. In the 17th century, the event regained its luster, under the reign of the Archdukes Albert VII and Isabella. In the 18th century, the decline of the demonstration began. The last (very small) Ommegang took place in 1785. File:Denis van Alsloot - The Ommeganck in Brussels on 31 May 1615. The Triumph of Archduchess Isabella.jpgThe Ommegang in Brussels on 31 May 1615.

In 1930, on the occasion of Belgium's centenary, some history enthusiasts supported efforts to commemorate once again the event, in the form of a historical procession. The organisers chose not to revive the ancestral \\"circumambulation\\", but to make it a spectacle reproducing the sumptuous Ommegang offered, in 1549, by the city of Brussels to Charles V and his son Philip II. Given the success of this performance, it was decided to repeat it in subsequent years. This was the origin of the current Ommegang. The current event brings together about 1,400 extras, including several dozen riders dressed in period costumes. There are also stilt walkers and giants such as the archangel Saint Michael, Saint Gudula, and the Bayard horse. Since 2011, a personality from the world of the arts is entrusted, each year, with the role of herald, and comments on the show at the Grand Place. Jean-Pierre Castaldi, Stéphane Bern, Jacques Weber, Francis Huster, Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt and Patrick Poivre d'Arvor, for example, have successively lent themselves to the exercise. Although it has become a historical show, the Ommegang nevertheless preserves many traditional and authentic elements, such as the presence of the Brussels Lineages, the Oaths of Crossbowmen, as well as the Virgin of Victories, and remains a major yearly event in the minds of the people of Brussels. Since 2019, the Ommegang has been recognised as an expression of intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.

Older larvae leave the mine and start feeding under a flap of the leaf margin that is folded down and attached to the blade underside with silk. Two or three such folds are made on the same or another leaf.

It is more popularly known as the , after its primary object of worship. Shōfuku-ji is the 5th temple in the Bandō Sanjūsankasho pilgrimage circuit of 33 Buddhist temples in the Kantō region of eastern Japan to the Bodhisattva Kannon. History According to temple legend, Shōfuku-ji was founded in the Nara period by the priest Dōkyō for the soul of the deceased Empress Kōken, and housed an image of Kannon brought to Japan by the famed Tang dynasty priest Guanjin, which had been owned by the Empress. However, no historical documents have survived to substantiate this legend, and the history of the temple is thus uncertain. The temple was relocated to its present location in 830 AD. Shōfuku-ji is mentioned in the Kamakura period story, Soga Monogatari, and enjoyed the patronage of the Go-Hōjō clan during the Sengoku period. The current Hondō dates from 1706, and is the oldest surviving structure of the temple, although the bronze bell is dated 1629. At present, the temple belongs to the Tō-ji branch of the Shingon sect of Japanese Buddhism. Its honzon is a Juichimen Kannon Bosatsu .

It established the principles that led to the development of the social model of disability, wherein a sharp distinction is made between impairment and disability. From the organisation's policy statement: \\"What we are interested in, are ways of changing our conditions of life, and thus overcoming the disabilities which are imposed on top our physical impairments by the way this society is organised to exclude us.\\" (UPIAS founding statement) History and platform UPIAS was founded in 1972 by Paul Hunt when he invited disabled people to form a group to confront disability issues, in a letter to The Guardian newspaper, 20 September 1972. Hunt developed his ideas when he was living in an institution (Le Court, Hampshire, a Leonard Cheshire Home) where he and others had been struggling in the 1960s with the authorities over the right of disabled people to control their own lives. The organisation's overtly political platform contrasted with the then predominant charity orientation of organisations involved in disability issues. Their founding statement explicitly rejected the charity concept: \\"All registered charities receive valuable tax concessions, but they are not allowed to campaign directly for political change. We regard political involvement as essential if disabled people are ever to make real advances. So in order to protect our independence of action we are not registered with the Charity Commissioners.\\" They created new definitions of impairment and disability. They defined impairment as \\"lacking part of or all of a limb, or having a defective limb, organism or mechanism of the body\\" and disability as \\"the disadvantage or restriction of activity caused by contemporary organisation which takes no or little account of people who have physical impairments and thus excludes them from the mainstream of social activities\\". They also rejected the notion that experts could prescribe how disabled people should live their lives: > We reject also the whole idea of \\"experts\\" and professionals holding forth > on how we should accept our disabilities, or giving learned lectures about > the \\"psychology\\" of disablement. We already know what it feels like to be > poor, isolated, segregated, done good to, stared at, and talked down to — > far better than any able-bodied expert. We as a Union are not interested in > descriptions of how awful it is to be disabled. What we are interested in, > are ways of changing our conditions of life, and thus overcoming the > disabilities which are imposed on top our physical impairments by the way > this society is organised to exclude us. In our view, it is only the actual > impairment which we must accept; the additional and totally unnecessary > problems caused by the way we are treated are essentially to be overcome and > not accepted. We look forward to the day when the army of \\"experts\\" on our > social and psychological problems can find more productive work. This rejection of the authority of experts was a consequence of the experience of some of the founders, including Hunt, who were residents of the Le Court Cheshire Home, with a study by independent consultants called in to resolve a dispute between residents and the management over the right of residents to self determination of how they live their own lives. UPIAS was disbanded by agreement of the members in November 1990 and the £50 in assets was given to BCODP, the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People. Over its lifetime it had around 141 members, and around 50 members at any one time  Archived records  In 2018-19 a substantial number of documents from the leadership of UPIAS were donated to the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP) archive project. Many of these documents remain closed, not available for public inspection, including the 80 Circulars that were produced as a confidential means for UPIAS members to candidly develop their political thinking (Appendix F). The collection includes Vic Finkelstein's letter to Paul Hunt in 1972 asking to join. However, various non-confidential papers are open and a book related to this collection of documents summarises the story of UPIAS. Leadership Leading members of UPIAS included Paul Hunt, Vic Finkelstein, Ken Davis and Maggie Davis (nee Hines). The Davis' pioneered independent living, by commissioning their own housing scheme at Grove Road in Sutton in Ashfield. After four years of work including buying the land, working with architects and bringing in some adapted fittings from Sweden, they moved in on 13 September 1976. A video documentary of the project was made in 1982 (page 97).

Opened in the 1790s, originally it wasn't an arm at all, but the start of the Warwick / Birmingham Canal. It took on the appearance of an (arm) branch when the Warwick / Napton canal, which junctions at the Birmingham Road / Budbrooke Industrial Estate, was completed. It is the last surviving branch (arm) of the much longer, nationally known Grand Union Canal.General information on the Grand Union inc. Saltisford Arm The arm was first opened in 1799 as a terminus for the Warwick and Birmingham Canal. Its initial purpose was purely to allow goods to be transported near to the town centre with its castle and market. However, the building of the gas works next to the end of the arm in 1822 also greatly increased its usage.A detailed study of Warwick's suburbs The restored arm It stayed under the control of the W&B; canal, through various mergers, until 1927, when it was purchased by the Regent's Canal company which, two years later, was renamed the Grand Union.Information on the various mergers forming the Grand Union The 1930s saw the site used extensively as a workyard and storage area during the construction of the nearby Hatton Locks.A good summary of the history of the branch The Transport Act 1947 saw the canal network as a whole nationalisedNational Archives information and British Waterways was formed after the Transport Act 1962 which split control of the canals and railways between two different authorities.A short history of British Waterways At this time, the arm, after leaving the main canal, passed under the Chiltern Main Line railway bridge and terminated at the back of what is now The Antelope Pub next to Sainsbury's, making it around 750 metres long. During the 1970s however, with the decline of the gasworks, the downsizing of the town market and the opening of the A46 bypass, usage of the arm decreased and it eventually fell into disuse. It was during this period that part of the arm was taken out of use and filled in.Living on a narrowboat.co.uk This led to the canal terminating just before the Chiltern Main Line, cutting its length to approximately 440 metres. The former canal bed is virtually untraceable, having been built over with houses and offices. All that remains is a well hidden bridge next to a car park. This led, in 1982, to the formation of the Saltisford Canal Trust which spent the next six years restoring the remainder of the route to its former glories.Information from a canal boat users online magazine Further work was done in 2007, helped by a £2,000 grant from the Inland Waterways Association.Documentation from Leicester University stating this The arm now houses several permanent boats, on which families live, as well as playing host to many travelling vessels and hiring out two boats for public use.Information on the current status of the arm See also *Grand Union Canal *Warwick References Category:Canals in England Category:Canals in Warwickshire Category:Buildings and structures in Warwick ","title":"Saltisford Canal Arm"},{"id":"29471546","text":"Soft Beds, Hard Battles is a 1974 British comedy film directed by Roy Boulting, starring Peter Sellers in several roles, and with an all-star cast, including Curt Jurgens, Lila Kedrova and Jenny Hanley.

New York Times 3 Dec 1972: D11. He called the film \\"a flippant look at war and the absurdities of war...

The union protested and said if any of the previous directors of Shepperton, such as the Boultings, tried to make films anywhere they would be blackbanned.

It is found from France, Germany, Poland and central Russia south to the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and North Macedonia. The larvae feed on Acer monspessulanum and Acer pseudoplatanus.

The mine starts as an epidermal corridor, that later turns into a blotch and in the end becomes a small triangular full depth blotch, generally in a vein axle. Older larvae leave the mine and continue living freely. In small leaves, the larva may be found in a leaf cone. In larger leaves, it can be found under a folded leaf segment.

Life Azeredo was born in Rio de Janeiro, in 1872, to Caetano Pinto de Azeredo (who died three months after Carlos' birth) and Leopoldina Magalhães de Azeredo. Since as a young man, Azeredo would write – when he was 12 years old he wrote a poetry book named Inspirações da Infância, that was never published, and with 17 years old he started to trade letters with Machado de Assis and Mário de Alencar. He made his primary studies in the Colégio São Carlos, in Porto, Portugal, later returning to Brazil (more precisely to the city of Itu), where he finished them at the Colégio São Luís. He entered the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo in 1888, graduating in 1893. Two years later, he entered the diplomatic career, where he served as minister in Uruguay, Cuba, Greece and the Holy See. He would stay permanently in Italy, until his death. Works Azeredo was a very proficuous writer, but his works remained unknown for some time in Brazil.

The district had 63 villages, 27 of which were formerly tenryō territory directly controlled by the Tokugawa shogunate or hatamoto retainers, and the remaining 36 of which were formerly exclaves of feudal domains from around the Kantō region. The largest single landholder in the area was Maebashi Domain of Kōzuke Province. After the Meiji Restoration, a large portion of the district came under the control of the short-lived Nagao Domain. On April 1, 1897, Asai District was merged into Awa District, Chiba and was subsequently divided between the towns of Shirahama, Chikura, Wada and Maruyama.

Mutharika has worked in the field of international justice, specialising in international economic law, international law and comparative constitutional law. He informally served as an adviser to his older brother, President Bingu wa Mutharika, on issues of foreign and domestic policy from the onset of his election campaign until the President's death on 5 April 2012. He has also held positions as Minister of Justice and later as Minister for Education, Science and Technology. Mutharika also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2011 to 2012. He was charged to help bridge relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom due to the deterioration of public diplomacy between the two nations after the Cochrane-Dyet controversy. Standing as the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Peter Mutharika was elected as President of Malawi in the 2014 election. Career =Early career= Mutharika received his law degree from the University of London in 1965. He then received his LL.M and JSD/PhD degrees from Yale University in 1966 and 1969 respectively. As a professor, he has taught at University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Haile Selassie University (Ethiopia), Rutgers University (USA), the United Nations Institute for Training and Research Program for Foreign Service Officers from Africa and Asia at Makerere University (Uganda), and for 37 years at Washington University (USA), and has served as an Academic Visitor at the London School of Economics (UK). He also served as advisor to the American Bar Association's Rule of Law initiative for Africa. =Late career= He assisted as an advisor in the campaign for his brother, Bingu wa Mutharika, for re-election as President in 2009. In 1995 he argued for limiting presidential powers in Malawi. He then entered Malawian politics where he became a Minister in a cabinet he helped to create. He also continued to serve as an adviser to the President until the President's death in 2012 in issues of foreign and domestic policy. =ICSID Arbitration Tribunal= Mutharika was part of a three-man tribunal that was arbitrating international cases. In August 2011, Mutharika decided to resign from two international court cases with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes that he was arbitrating on Zimbabwe where foreign investors sued the Zimbabwean government for breaches of bilateral investment treaties. This was due to concerns about his impartiality because of Bingu Mutharika's close associations with the Mugabe government. Political life Mutharika with Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd He is the President of DPP in Malawi. In May 2009, he was elected to the Malawian Parliament, and he was subsequently appointed by his brother Bingu wa Mutharika to the Malawi Cabinet as Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. He then became Minister of Education, Science and Technology and as of 8 September 2011 he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new \\"war cabinet\\". =DPP Factions= In 2010, tensions rose over claims that President Bingu wa Mutharika's planned to name Peter Mutharika, his brother, as the party successor over the sitting vice-president, Joyce Banda. The Vice-President was later fired from the DPP and launched her own party, the People's Party (PP). Some people in DPP resigned over the dismissal of the Vice-President. In line with Malawi's laws, Joyce Banda still remained the country's Vice-President although she was fired from the DPP. DPP Presidential Endorsement In August 2011, the DPP National Governing Council (NGC) endorsed Peter Mutharika as presidential candidate for the 2014 elections. This announcement came a few days after the 20 July 2011 protests where nationwide strikes were held against Bingu Mutharika's regime. His appointment was endorsed by the DPP NGC since the party did not hold a convention to elect new leaders. The Secretary General, Wakuda Kamanga stated that the decision was made in spite of the protests because the party believed that the \\"anger would fade\\". This endorsement also led to the firing of those that were against the nomination process within the party including first vice-president Joyce Banda and second vice-president Khumbo Kachali. =US citizenship controversy= Peter Mutharika's candidacy for position as a government minister and his eligibility for presidency had been controversial because of speculation and doubt over his Malawian citizenship. A senior Political and Administrative lecturer at the University of Malawi, Mustapha Hussein has stated that his \\"eligibility should be viewed in the context of his being Malawian, he would be above 35 years of age by 2014, and he has not been convicted of any criminal activities for the past seven years.\\". Malawi's laws however, do not allow dual citizenship and it was wrongly speculated that he obtained US citizenship whilst living in the US and hence, had renounced his Malawian citizenship as is required by law. Nonetheless, the US embassy in Lilongwe confirmed that he is not a citizen but a Green card holder. The ruling DPP has stated that Mutharika is a Malawian citizen and would run for president as a Malawian citizen and not an American one. There was controversy that, as the holder of a US Greencard, he owes an allegiance to the United States. Therefore, people on the street are of the view that a nation cannot be run by someone who will be spending the minimum of three months in the US annually required to retain permanent resident status. In February 2014, he relinquished his green card and permanent resident status. =2014 election= Peter Mutharika was elected as President in the 2014 election. He was sworn in as President on 31 May 2014.Zawadi Chilunga, \\"'So help me God': Mutharika sworn in as Malawi President, Chilima VP\\" , Nyasa Times, 31 May 2014. Naming his cabinet in June 2014, Mutharika took charge of the defense portfolio himself. He appointed the veteran economist Goodall Gondwe as Minister of Finance and appointed one of the defeated presidential candidates, Atupele Muluzi, as Minister of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining.\\"Malawi's president completes cabinet\\", AFP, 23 June 2014. As of June 2014, he supported diversification of Malawi's agriculture into other crops besides tobacco. His first term was marked by strong popular discontent, due to corruption, food shortages and power cuts. In 2018, thousands of people took to the streets in several cities across the country to denounce corruption scandals. Mutharika was accused of the involvement in a bribery case, suspected of having received more than $200,000 from a businessman who had obtained a multi-million dollar contract with the police. Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) cleared Muthatika on the Malawi Police Service food rations contract allegations. The ACB stated that investigations into the Malawi Police Service (MPS) food rations contract have revealed that President Peter Mutharika did not personally benefit from $200,000 deposited in the Democratic Progressive Party's bank account. =2019 election= On 21 May 2019, Malawi held elections to elect a new president, members of parliament, and local government councillors. Peter Mutharika was nominated and endorsed as the presidential candidate of the DPP. His main challenger was Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP). Saulos Chilima, who had been Mutharika's vice president since 2014, also put up a strong challenge against Mutharika since the two parted ways in April 2018. The election was marred with controversy and claims of rigging by Mutharika's DPP. In some districts such as Nsanje and Chikwawa in the southern end of Malawi, the Malawi Electoral Commission staff managing the polls were accused of swapping the presidential results for Chakwera to be for Mutharika. A district polling staff for Nsanje, Fred Thomas, was arrested for being found tampering with results sheets of the election. Similar issues of vote rigging and threatening of opposition political party monitors by the DPP were reported in other districts such as Zomba, Thyolo, Mulanje, Lilongwe and Nkhotakota. A lot of results sheets were also affected by tampering by \\"tippexing\\". Political thugs, thought to be from the DPP, got hold of results and changed figures by 'erasing' original figures by applying tippex (a brand of correction fluid). This led to the election to be known as \\"the Tippex Election\\", and the subsequent election of Mutharika as \\"the Tippex President\\". On 27 May 2019 and despite all the irregularities, the Malawi Electoral Commission Chairperson Supreme Court judge Justice Jane Ansah, announced Mutharika as the winner of the controversial elections with 1,940,709 votes against 1,781,740 for closest challenger Dr Lazarus Chakwera of the MCP. Saulos Chilima, who represented the UTM polled 1,018,369 votes. Mutharika was subsequently sworn in on 28 May 2019 for a new five-year term. The opposition MCP and UTM have then further applied to the High Court of Malawi to nullify the election results and conduct another election. Meanwhile, supporters of the opposition continued conducting demonstrations ever since against the conduct of the elections. On 3 February 2020, the Constitutional Court judges arrived in Lilongwe court to give a long-awaited ruling on that disputed presidential election, travelling in a military vehicle under heavy police escort. The judges took turns to read the 500-page decision over more than seven hours. The Malawi Constitutional Court ruled to nullify the 21 May 2019 election, citing irregularities by the Malawi Electoral Commission. It further ordered fresh election to be conducted in 150 days. The nullification was unprecedented in Malawi, and only the second instance of such happening in Africa, the other being the Supreme Court of Kenya decision regarding the 2017 Kenyan presidential election. =2020 election= Mutharika was defeated by Lazarus Chakwera in the 2020 election, having only obtained about 40% of the vote. Chakwera was sworn in as president of Malawi on 28 June 2020. =Anti- corruption investigations= In August 2020, the Malawi Anti-Corruption Commission froze the bank accounts of Peter and his wife Gertrude, as a part of an anti-corruption investigation into the importation of K5 billion dollars' worth of cement free of taxes, a privilege for incumbent presidents in Malawi.https://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi-freezes-bank-accounts-of-ex- president-mutharika-wife-gertrude/ =Personal life= Henry Bellingham of the British Foreign Office Mutharika has two daughters and a son from his first marriage. His first wife, Christophine, died while the children were young. She was a Catholic from the Caribbean. Mutharika remained a widower for more than thirty years, but on 21 June 2014, he married Gertrude Maseko, a member of the Malawi Parliament. Mutharika is a member of the Presbyterian Church. He is the younger brother of Bingu wa Mutharika, Malawi's third president. =Selected works= * Foreign Investment Security in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Emerging Policy and Legal Frameworks (book) *\\"Accountability for Political Abuses in Pre-Democratic Malawi: The Primacy of Truth\\" – Third World Legal Studies, 2003. *\\"Approaches to Restorative Justice in Malawi\\", 13th Commonwealth Law Conference, Melbourne, Australia, April 2003. *\\"Legal System of Malawi\\", Legal Systems of the World (2002) *\\"Some Thoughts on Rebuilding African State Capability,\\" Washington University Law Quarterly (1998) *\\"Creating an Attractive Investment Climate in the Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Region,\\" Foreign Investment Law Journal (1997) *\\"The Role of the United Nations Security Council in African Peace Management: Some Proposals,\\" Michigan Journal of International Law (1996) *\\"The 1995 Democratic Constitution of Malawi,\\" Journal of African Law (1996) *\\"The Role of International Law in the Twenty-First Century: An African Perspective,\\" Fordham International Law Journal (1995) and reprinted in Commonwealth Law Bulletin (1995). *\\"The Regulation of Statelessness Under International and National Law,\\" Oceana Publications (1986) *\\"The Alien Under American Law,\\" Oceana Publications (1988) *\\"The International Law of Development,\\" Oceana Publications (1995) *\\"The Work of Council International Co-operation Of Humanity,\\" African Magazine (2003) =Awards= He is a recipient of the following awards; * International Jurist Award, 2008 * The African Leadership Award, 2016 and Medal of Honour, 2016 * Doctors of Human Letters, University of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 2016 * State of Georgia Senate Citation of Merit, 2016 * Honorary Professor, University of International Business and Economics, Beijing, China, 2018 * Nelson Mandela Leadership Award, National Baptist Convention, 2018 * Doctor of Human Letters, Washington University, 2018 *Senior Of Politics Debate, Indonesian Jakarta Collage, 2019 * = International positions held = * President, International Third-World Legal Studies Association, 1986-1993 * Global Fund Replenishment Champion, 2018-2019 * Member, Committee of Ten African Heads of State Championing the Advancement of Education, Science and Technology, appointed by the African Union 2018 * Champion, Global Partnership for Education * African Development Bank, Youth Champion * Co-convenor, Global Commission on Financing Education * Champion, Trade Related Aspects of Property Rights (TRIPS) * UN Women \\"HeForShe\\" Champion * UNFPA Global Youth Champion *Advisor in Council of the Economic and Trade Cooperation of African Youth (ETCAY) *Board Chairperson for United Nations Economic and Trade Commission of Africa References External links * The Biographical Sketch of Peter Mutharika * - Mutharika, Peter Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Democratic Progressive Party (Malawi) politicians Category:Foreign Ministers of Malawi Category:Government ministers of Malawi Category:Living people Category:Malawian academics Category:Malawian Presbyterians Category:Members of the National Assembly of Malawi Category:Presidents of Malawi Category:Yale University alumni Category:Washington University in St. Louis faculty Category:People from Thyolo District ","title":"Peter Mutharika"},{"id":"29471696","text":"The Kamuku National Park is a Nigerian national park in Kaduna State, Nigeria, with a total area of about . The park has a typical Sudanian Savanna ecology. Location and history The park is located in the west of Kaduna State, and is adjacent to the Kwiambana Game Reserve to the north west and 14 km away from main town. It was established in 1936 as the Native Authority Forest Reserve of Birnin Gwari under the Northern Nigeria Government. It was upgraded from a state Game Reserve to a National Park in May 1999, in part due to the success of a community-based project promoting sustainable resource usage, managed by Savanna Conservation Nigeria, a national NGO. The Federal government has been seeking to partner with foreign investors to develop eco- tourism in this and other national parks.  Environment  The park has generally flat terrain, sloping gradually upwards to the Birnin Gwari Ridge along the eastern boundary. Natural features of interest include the Dogon Ruwa Waterfalls; the Goron Dutse, a large isolated inselberg with a smooth surface stratified in a pattern of black and white squares; and the Tsaunin Rema, a hill made of large boulders piled on top of each other, with a large population of rock hyraxes. Vegetation is Guinea Savanna with some transitional Sudan Savanna elements in places. The park and the nearby forest reserves have some of the best preserved blocks of this ecosystem in the country. Dominant trees include Isoberlinia doka, Terminalia avicennioides and Detarium macrocarpum. Other common trees include Daniellia oliveri, Nauclea latifolia, Acacia, Lophira lanceolata, Parkia biglobosa, Prosopis africana and Isoberlinia tomentosa. The riparian forests that line small, seasonal rivers often include oil palms (Elaeis guineensis). Other common plant species include Afzelia, Monotes and Raphia shrubs. Fauna Secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius) Mammals include elephants, roan antelopes, duikers, hartebeest, baboons, warthog, bushbuck, patas monkeys, and green monkeys. There are at least 177 species of birds, including migrants and residents. The park is important for species such as the secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the Abyssinian ground- hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus) which are rare in other parts of Nigeria. People The area in and around the park is the home of the Gwari and Kamuku people, traditional farmers, hunters, pastoralists and craftsmen, noted for weaving, mat making and pottery. The Gwari are said to have originated from Zungeru in Niger State, and the Kamuku are said to have come from the Sokoto and Katsina areas during the Fulani jihad at the start of the 19th century. The park includes places considered sacred by these people, such as hills, rock outcrops, marshes and streams, and the ancient Parnono Shrine. The present town of Birnin Gwari was founded in 1957 by Gwari people who had migrated from an earlier settlement about 50 km to the north. Hunting and illegal cattle-grazing by the pastoralist settlements on the edge of the park pose threats to the park environment.

It was released on June 5, 2012 in North America, July 12, 2012 in Australia and on July 13, 2012 in Europe for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was later released for Windows on June 8, 2012 in Europe, July 12, 2012 in Australia and July 26, 2012 in North America. It features gravity manipulation and destructible environments. Plot In Vanguard City, policeman Davis Russell and his partner Leo Delgado are on duty when the city comes under attack by an army of strange barbaric soldiers called Lutadores armed with gravity-defying technology. As the ground is shaking in the wake of the attack, Davis and Leo hurry to Davis' apartment to check on his wife Cara and his daughter Leila. Upon arrival, the duo find Cara wounded and Leila missing. Cara dies of her injuries and Davis and Leo are soon captured by the Lutadores, who have taken control of the city. Davis and Leo are taken to a prison camp and forced by the Lutadores to dig in a tunnel system, Davis only getting by on the hope that his daughter is still alive. A month into their imprisonment, they meet a man named Fitzgerald who claims he belongs to a resistance movement fighting the Lutadores. When questioned about Leila by Davis, Fitzgerald says that there are no children left in the city, all of them having been killed or taken prisoner. Davis and Leo are sent back into the tunnels, where they discover a hole leading out of the prison, but are then attacked by a giant robot and recaptured by the Lutadores. With Davis wounded from the fight with the robot, Fitzgerald distracts the guards to give him and Leo a chance to escape. The duo manage to make it out of the prison and back into the ruins of Vanguard City, now heavily occupied by Lutadore forces. Returning to Davis' apartment in the hopes of picking up Leila's trail, Davis and Leo find nothing, but soon encounter a group of the resistance members Fitzgerald spoke of, led by a soldier named Banks. Banks explains that the Lutadores have a base at a site called Camp T'Kal, where they are keeping the captured children. Banks agrees to bring Davis and Leo along on their mission to attack Camp T'Kal if they can help uncover its location. Davis and Leo infiltrate a Lutadore command center, where they question the commander, who tells them the location of Camp T'Kal. Making their way through the city to Camp T'Kal with Banks' forces, Davis and Leo are forced to proceed alone when Banks leaves to take an escaped child back. The duo proceed deeper into the base, finding an extremely high-tech complex underground. Davis and Leo soon reach an observation room revealing that Vanguard City is not on a planet, but inside one of several giant domes connected to the massive spaceship they have wandered into. Shocked and confused, Leo begins to lose hope but is convinced by Davis to keep pushing through to find Leila. The two continue on, finding themselves in a ruined lava-filled city resembling Vanguard, and conclude that it is the dome from which the Lutadores originate. Davis and Leo manage to locate the vehicle transporting the captured children and eventually catch up to the prisoners but fail to find Leila among them and are then captured by the Lutadores. As the Lutadore leader, Kiltehr, prepares to execute Davis and Leo, the Lutadore is stormed by Banks and his men. Davis and Leo pursue Kiltehr into the core of the spaceship, the Inversion. Kiltehr, who has now taken control of the ship, sends Lutadores and the same type of robot that Davis and Leo encountered in the tunnels, to stop them. Davis and Leo soon confront Kiltehr in the ship's engine room, where he begins its self-destruct sequence. Overpowering Kiltehr, Davis grabs the control key from Kiltehr to stop the self-destruct, throwing it to Leo just as Kiltehr attacks him, knocking Davis and himself down a pit. Leo manages to stop the self-destruct just in time, and with their leader dead the Lutadores surrender, allowing the remaining people of Vanguard to begin rebuilding. Although Vanguard City's true nature as a part of the Inversion has been revealed, it is still unknown who built the ship and where it is going. Leo mentions that Davis was never found, and it is revealed that Leo found Leila's dead body when he and Davis returned to the apartment after escaping the prison, but did not have the heart to tell him. In a post-credits sequence, Davis is shown climbing back up the pit that he and Kiltehr fell into. Reception Upon release, Inversion received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Digital Fix gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of six out of ten and called it \\"a solidly unspectacular shooter\\". Digital Spy also gave the same console version three stars out of five and called it \\"a game that feels instantly familiar, and not in a good way. The game lifts heavily from more illustrious sources, while its own unique selling point, gravity powers, never feels fully exploited. But equally, the game is a solid and reasonably well-produced shooter that is fun to play, particularly with other people. As long as you don't expect a revolution, you will have a good time battling this particular alien invasion.\\" The Guardian gave the Xbox 360 version a similar score of three stars out of five and said it was \\"a nicely crafted game with some good ideas, which nevertheless seems unwilling to claim an identity of its own. If you liked Gears of War, you'll enjoy playing it, but you might find its sheer familiarity a bit annoying. And if you like third-person shooters that don't require superhuman skills, you'll enjoy it, too. But if you're looking for something futuristic, cutting-edge and distinctive, keep on looking.\\" However, Metro gave the same console version three out of ten and said, \\"Combat and storytelling are boring beyond belief, but what's worst about Inversion is that you can sense the far more interesting game it could've been just beneath the surface.\\" References External links * Inversion at Namco Bandai Games site * Category:2012 video games Category:Bandai Namco games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Shooter video games Category:Third- person shooters Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games using Havok ","title":"Inversion (video game)"},{"id":"29471830","text":"Caloptilia roscipennella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

Biography  He was born Henri Étienne-Martin 4 February 1913 in Loriol, Drôme, France. He attended the Ecole des Beaux Arts de Lyon from 1929 to 1933, where he met Marcel Michaud. Martin moved to Paris in 1934, working at the studio of Charles Malfray at the Académie Ranson where he came into contact with such painters as Roger Bissière, Jean Le Moal, Jean Bertholle, Alfred Manessier, Zelman, Véra Pagava, and the sculptor François Stahly. With them, he became part of the group Témoignage, which had exhibitions in Paris in 1938 and 1939. He worked primarily in wood and plaster, creating works inspired by his childhood memories of his home in Loriol. Later sculpture included bronze, string, and textiles. During World War II Étienne Martin was a prisoner in Germany and was liberated in 1941. In 1942 he traveled to Oppède with Stahly et Zelman and then in 1943-1944 he went to Dieulefit, Drôme where he met the writer Henri-Pierre Roché. Next he moved to Mortagne-au-Perche, Normandy. On his return to Paris in 1947 he lived with Roché, and he met Brâncuși and Gurdjieff. Over the next dozen years he became spiritual, practicing Eastern religions including Taoism. In 1954 Martin began his series of Demeures (Dwellings) for which he became well known. He received in 1966 the grand prize for sculpture in the 33rd Venice Biennale. He was a professor and head of the sculpture department from 1968 to 1983 at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He was elected 1971 to the Académie des beaux-arts. In 1984 an exhibition bringing together all his Demeures was held at the Pompidou Center in Paris. In 2010, June to September, a new exhibition at the Pompidou Center, paid respect to the artist by showing fifteen sculptures, drawing, personal notebooks, and photographs of his studio. He died in 1995 from cardiac arrest.

History In 1988 Stephen P. Anderson, under the moniker of Zonic Shockum, recorded a 17-song cassette titled Pleasure which received distribution through Sound Choice mail-order catalog and Tower Records in Philadelphia and garnered a positive review in the German music magazine Zap. The tape featured girlfriend Debbie Polak singing on one song, and co-worker Marc Sonstein playing drums on another. Anderson's cover of \\"Chinese Rock\\" was carted at Drexel University's 91.7 for regular airplay. In 1989 Polak and Sonstein joined Anderson as permanent members to form the nucleus of the performing and writing outfit. The trio record the track \\"Filth Divine\\" for Black Plastic Record's Powerless Compilation. That same year Larry Feraca came on briefly as bass player until being replaced in 1990 by Mitchell Landsman who contributed as a songwriter and vocalist. Bob Fowler came on in 1990 as lead guitarist. With this line-up, the band recorded its first self-released single \\"Whores\\" which received airplay at WKDU and WPRB as well as favorable reviews in Flipside and Philadelphia City Paper. The band then hit the local Philly bar, college & warehouse circuit for live gigs. In 1992, after hearing a demo, Bryan Dilworth contacted the band to release a record on his fledgling Compulsiv Records label. Bryan put Zonic Shockum into the studio with Adam Lasus at Studio Red to record a 5-song EP for Compusiv and later a Sinatra tune, \\"Dream Away\\" for release on a double-CD from Grass Records in 1993 which also featured such notable acts as The Flaming Lips, Jawbox, and Screeching Weasel. Prior to recording \\"Dream Away\\" Marc's brother Ned Sonstein replaced Landsman on Bass. After a break-in and equipment theft at their North Philadelphia rehearsal studio, Zonic Shockum relocated to a Northern Liberties practice space and recorded their next self-released single \\"No, You Suck\\" using a 4-track cassette recorder. Despite low production values, \\"No, You Suck\\" was listed as one of WKDU's top ten songs for 1993. A short time later, Bob left the line-up, Debbie and Steve married, and the Andersons and Sonsteins continued on as a four-piece. In 1994 WKDU invited the band to contribute a track to its upcoming 7\\" boxed-set titled Scrapple, and so the band recorded \\"Labor\\" on an 8-track reel-to-reel recorder on loan from Adam Lasus. In 1995, Zonic Shockum entered Art Difuria's Frizz recording studio in Center City Philadelphia and recorded six songs. Five of these tracks would be included in the band's self-titled debut CD. The remaining track, \\"The Wedding Song\\" was featured in the Kate McCabe 16mm documentary film Go-Go Mama Rama which was screened at the 1997 New York Underground Film Festival. Later that same year Zonic returned to Studio Red to work with J. Cox and record the remainder of the tracks for their debut album. Prior to the release of the self-titled CD, Marc left to pursue a career as a restaurateur and opened his first café on Market Street in Philadelphia - which also provided a new practice space for the band in the storage area above the restaurant. Ned made the transition from bass to drums. Debbie took up the bass - and the new power trio format was born. In 1998 Zonic got back with recording engineer J. Cox and set up camp in Manayunk, PA's Cycle Sound to record the 6-song EP \\"Here Today...\\" which Razorcake magazine refers to as: \\"Lady-fronted dissonant punk rock that won't be pigeonholed.\\" A finely-honed Zonic Shockum was now playing some of the best venues of their career including CBGB and an indoor skate park with cKy, but Ned eventually lost interest in the group and quit. In 2004, the original 5 performing members got back together briefly to play a benefit concert at their beloved Khyber Pass Pub to raise money for a friend of the group who had been diagnosed with stage IV cancer. Shortly thereafter Steve and Debbie relocated to Polak's hometown in the Lehigh Valley where they have continued to write and record music together as Zonic Shockum. In 2015 they have joined forces once again with original drummer, Marc Sonstein.

Burnet (1788–1816 ) was a Scottish painter of rural scenes, based in the London area for most of his career. Life He was born in Musselburgh in 1788, the fourth son of George Burnet, general surveyor of excise in Scotland, and his wife Anne Cruikshank. The painter and engraver John Burnet was his elder brother. While apprenticed to a wood carver named Liddel he also studied art at John Graham's evening classes at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh. In 1810, having decided to devote himself to painting, he moved to London, where his brother John was already working. Impressed by the work of David Wilkie, whose Blind Fiddler his brother was then engraving, and the Dutch paintings he saw in London, especially those of Aelbert Cuyp and Paulus Potter, he was inspired towards a naturalistic approach in his paintings. He had a studio in Chelsea, – his address is given in the Royal Academy catalogues as 26, St. George's Row – and based his landscapes on sketches made in the area around Fulham and Battersea, which was then still largely rural. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1812 and 1814. Many of his paintings feature cattle. Allan Cunningham wrote: > Some of our cattle-painters, imagining that the more flesh cows have the > more milk they will give, have plumped them up into a condition for the > butcher, but not for the milk-pail. Burnet knew that a moderately lean cow > produced most milk, and in this way he drew them. But in all that he did he > desired to tell a story. This he knew would give interest to his works, and > produce at the same time action, expression, and variety. Nor did he confine > his studies to the fields alone: he made himself familiar with the indoor as > well as outdoor economy of a farmer's household during seed-time, summer, > harvest, and winter; he left no implement of husbandry unsketched, and > scarcely any employment of the husbandman without delineation. While sketching in the fields he also made detailed notes about the effects of light and cloud formations. Burnet died of tuberculosis at Lee (then in Kent) on 27 July 1816, at the age of 28, and was buried in Lewisham churchyard. Two paintings, once belonging John Sheepshanks are in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. References Sources * External links * Works by Burnet in British public collections.

Built-in holds were extended if mission parameters allowed for additional checks or to correct issues. Launches of the Space Shuttle to the International Space Station did not allow for holds to be extended due to the launch window which was limited to no more than 10 minutes due to the 90 minute orbit period of the station and speed of Earth's rotation ( at the Kennedy Space Center), which puts the launch pads east of the station on its next orbit.

Randel is also noted for having received one of the largest awards at the time as a result of his breach of contract lawsuit against the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company. The company's appeals of the judgment went to the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed the award, as well as Randel's right to directly receive canal tolls in order to collect it. Early life Randel was born in Albany, New York on December 3, 1787 to a large and close family; he was one of the middle children. His father, John Sr. (1755–1823), was a second generation Scotch- Irish American who was a jeweler and brass founder, while his mother Catherine (or Katurah or Keturah; 1761–1836) was born in New Jersey to a land-rich family. John Sr. served in the American Revolutionary War as a private, and married Catherine in 1780, a year after he was released from his regiment for the injuries he had sustained.Holloway, pp. 20–21 John Jr.'s formal education encompassed only primary school, where he learned to respect the ideas and ideals of the Enlightenment.Holloway, p. 24 As a young man, Randel would be deeply committed to reason, but was also a religious man, disagreeing, for instance with Thomas Paine's views about religion expressed in The Age of Reason. Raised in a very tight-knit Presbyterian community, Randel attended church regularly, and strictly held the Sabbath as a day of rest; one of his workers later complained that they were unable to keep up with their correspondence because Randel would not let him write letters on Sundays. While working in Manhattan, Randel sometimes crossed the Hudson River by ferry to attend the First Presbyterian Church in Orange, New Jersey, where relatives of his mother were elders. It was on these visits that he met the woman who became his first wife, his cousin, Matilda Harrison, whom he married in 1813.Holloway, pp. 22–23; 58–60; 98 After his formal education ended, Randel was apprenticed, possibly as early as age 12 although more likely at 16, to Simeon De Witt, who was the Surveyor General of New York State. De Witt was familiar with Randel, as both families were from Albany, a city of only 7,500 at the time, and Randel's father had served with De Witt's brother in the American Revolution.Koeppel, pp. 96–97 It was a time in American history when many young men went into surveying, at least for a short time, as there was a great need for them as the empty places - empty of whites, anyway - began to become settled.Holloway, pp. 30–33 When Randel finished his apprenticeship and became an assistant surveyor, he interpreted the field reports of other surveyors to draft maps based on them of land in the Adirondack Mountains and on the Oneida Reservation, mapped the Albany Turnpike between Albany and Schenectady and the Great Western Turnpike from Albany to Cooperstown, and surveyed property lots in Albany and in Central New York, particularly Oneida CountyKoeppel, p.96Holloway, pp. 19; 36; 44 Mapping Manhattan Despite his meager experience, through a recommendation by De Witt, one of three commissioners charged with developing a plan for the future layout of New York City's streets, and approval by Gouvernor Morris, one of the other commissioners and the unofficial president of the commission, Randel, at age 20, was hired to replace the commission's original chief surveyor, Charles Frederick Loss, who had proved to be incompetent.Koeppel, pp. 90–94; 96 Marguerite Holloway, Randel's biographer, divides his work in New York into three periods. The first, from 1808 to 1810, resulted in the 1811 publication of the Commissioners' Plan. Phase two ran from 1811 to 1817, during which he completed the necessary geodetic surveying and inscribed the grid into the land. The final phase was from around 1818 to 1821, when Randel and his first wife Matilda became high quality cartographers, makers of maps.Holloway, pp. 51–52 Randel began work in June 1808, and was ordered to conduct a detailed survey of Manhattan island to help produce the plan of New York City's future streets. The final map, the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, laid out the streets of New York from 14th Street to 155th Street into a rectangular grid, without accommodating the island's terrain. After the publication of the Commissioners' Plan, at the instigation of the commission, Randel was retained by the Common Council of New York for the next 6 years continue the surveying necessary to lay down actual streets, as the Commissioners' Plan was more notional than practical. To do this work, Randel was given an allocation of $1,000 for surveying instruments (), but he also spent his own money - between $2,400 () and $3,000 () - developing seven surveying instruments which, among other benefits, would not vary in size because of temperature changes, resulting in great precision. An expert in Colonial era surveying equipment has expressed the opinion, after closely examining images of Randel's new instruments - the pamphlet that explained them has been lost - that Randel was \\"Basically ... a mechanical genius.\\"Holloway, pp. 77–85Koeppel, p. 136 Commissioner Simeon De Witt said of Randel's work that it was made \\"with an accuracy not exceeded by any work of the kind in America.\\" To inscribe the grid onto the land, Randel and his staff erected almost 1,600 markers - primarily long, square marble monuments inscribed with the number of the street, placed at each intersection. Where rocks prevented the use of the marble markers, they blasted holes with gunpowder, poured in lead, and anchored long, square iron bolts. In all, they positioned 1,549 marble markers and 98 iron bolts to define the pattern of the grid.Holloway, pp. 9;14 As part of the third stage of his work, Randel created an extremely large map of the city, at an unprecedented scale. This was done by way of ninety-two by colored \\"Farm Maps\\" made at a scale of that overlaid Manhattan's natural topography with the intended grid. When put together, the Farm Maps made a map of the city about long. It took Randel and his wife Matilda two years, from 1819 to 1820, to finish the maps, working from their new home, having moved to Orange, New Jersey. He needed, asked for, and received an extension from the Common Council to complete the task, and even then he did not quite make the deadline, delivering the last maps in September 1820, about four months late.Holloway, pp. 120–125Augustyn & Cohen, pp. 110 111Koeppel, pp. 132–134 Randel's Farm Maps are praised for their accuracy and usefulness. Historian Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, in his The Iconography of Manhattan Island, 1498-1909 called them \\"the most complete and valuable topographical record of the period that exists. It is, in fact, the only early topographical record of the island.\\"Holloway, p.125; quoting Stokes, I. N. Phelps (1915–1928) The Iconography of Manhattan Island, 1498-1909 v. 1 p. 564 New York: R. H. Dodd As well as the Farm Maps, Randel also produced an atlas of the city, filling in with \\"astounding precision\\" the details of street locations and elevations which had been left off the official map.Koeppel, p. 97 =The map controversy= There was a controversy regarding the publication of the map of the Commissioners' Plan. Randel had begun to prepare a map to go to the engraver, using his original papers, when he found out that the council had given William Bridges, one of the handful of city-recognized surveyors, the right to do so. Bridges simply copied one of Randel's previously published maps, which were in the public domain, introducing errors as he did so. Bridges published and copyrighted the resulting map as a private venture, leaving Randel out in the cold.Augustyn & Cohen, pp. 100–106 The conflict between the two men did not come to a head until three years later, in 1814, when Randel starting advertising his own version of the Commissioners' Plan map, which he said was \\"more correct\\" then the previously published one - he did not mention Bridges by name - not only because of the errors he claimed has crept into the map when Bridges copied it, but because he, Randel, \\"has since completed the measurements and fixed monuments by contract with the [Common Council], [therefore] he alone is possessed of all the materials for this valuable work.\\" He published a letter from Gouverneur Morris, who called Randel's map \\"an excellent work ... indispensable to those who wish to make themselves acquainted with the Topography of that interesting space which is comprizes [sic]. It appears to me more accurate than anything of the kind which has yet appeared. ... I consider it highly deserving of public patronage.\\" Bridges shot back, commenting that Randel was \\"unprincipled\\" and \\"conceited\\", and lacking in \\"honorable conduct\\". Randel, of course, responded, listing many, but not all, of the errors in Bridges' map, including islands that were not the right length, width, or in the wrong place, rocks and hills misplaced and mis-sized, rivers and forts too close to each other, missing and misplaced buildings, and streets shown as closed which were not. Bridges, whose reputation both as a surveyor and as a man was far from clean, did not reply, perhaps because his wife was sick at the time, and died several months after Randel's second letter. In any case, Bridges himself died shortly after that, and Randel did not publish his map or had it engraved, due to national security concerns connected with the War of 1812. He eventually published it in 1821.Holloway, pp. 104–10 Randel's future litigious behavior may have been founded on his being wronged in not receiving what he felt was the proper credit for his work on the Manhattan map. When Randel returned to the New York City map project, he had a new idea about it: the map of the city would be integrated into a map of the Northeastern United States. In need of money - the Panic of 1819 was in effect, and the only work given to Randel by New York City was a survey of the Brooklyn Navy Yard - Randel hoped that the unusual new map would bring in some cash. He cleared the project with his mentor, Simeon De Witt, whose map of New York state was highly praised, and engaged noted engraver Peter Maverick. When it was published in 1821, it included a large-scale map of Philadelphia that scrolled over Brooklyn and Queens, while the map of Manhattan scrolled over the map of the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island and part of Massachusetts. New York state directly north of the city was also shown up to the longitude of Connecticut's northern border. While beautiful and innovative, and praised at the time for its accuracy and arrangement, the map was not a financial success, nor was the Common Council satisfied at the small scale at which Manhattan was shown. They bought 24 copies of the map, and then engaged another mapmaker for a larger scale map which could be more easily utilized. Randel wrote to the mayor that he would attempt to make a map of twice the size, but never did. In fact, the map was the only engraved map he was to make in his lifetime: his earlier maps of the Commissioner's Plan and his Farm Maps were done by hand. Only a single copy of the map remains, in the Library of Congress.Holloway, pp. 127–133Augustyn & Cohen, pp. 106–109A color reproduction of the map can be see in Upstate and other projects Even while in the midst of his work on Manhattan, Randel engaged in other projects. In September 1810, for instance, he measured the Albany Post Road from Albany to New York City, finding it to be 154 miles long. Randel also suggested changes to the road to make it shorter, which later altered postage rates between the cities by one-third. He produced a long map of the road, which showed it entering into an already gridded New York City.Holloway, p.62 Between 1811 and 1822, Randel's projects included work in Oswego, Oneida, and Oneida Castle, New York; the Salt Springs Reservation in Onondaga, New York; the New Military Tract; islands in the St. Lawrence River; and the upper Hudson River, where he had been hired by merchants interested in building a canal from Albany to New Baltimore, New York to avoid the river's hazards in that area.Holloway, pp. 112–113; 115–117 Part of the Delaware & Raritan Canal, which Randel was hired to survey a route for c.1816, as seen in 2013 In 1815, Randel was engaged by the Committee of Surveys of the city government of Albany to do a survey. Randel wrote that he was returning to New York City to get his equipment, and asked that monuments be ready when he returned. In 1816, the committee voided the contract, citing the delay in Randel starting the work. Randel was incensed, writing in one of his field books all he had done to prepare for the job, including constructing new instruments, at the cost to himself of $6,461.47 (). By 1819 he had determined that he would get no relief from the Albany government, and he filed suit against the members of the committee for not honoring the contract. He lost the case, but it did not cure him of the inclination to use the courts when he felt slighted or taken advantage of: it was the first in a long line of lawsuits that Randel would file over the rest of his life.Holloway, pp. 125–27 At some point, Randel bought two lots in upstate New York, among many that he had purchased for himself and his family, including a house in Albany. Lots 71 and 74 of the tract known as the First Pagan Purchase may have been the sites where Randel and his brother Abraham started farms near to each other. Randel ran his through trusted caretakers, although he was involved via correspondence with decisions concerning the running of the farm. He also acted as an agent for Abraham in selling hops in New York City. After 1810, the fiscal responsibilities connected to the properties he owned began to weigh on him.Holloway, pp. 93–96 Around 1816, John Rutherfurd, the third of the Commissioners of the 1811 Plan, hired Randel to survey a route for the proposed Delaware & Raritan Canal between the Delaware and Raritan Rivers. This Randel did, estimating water flows with the aid of a millwright.Holloway, p.179 In 1819 he drew up plane out a route for a canal to carry ships and sloops from Albany.Gray, pp. 45–46 After Manhattan =The Erie Canal controversy= Shortly after his work on the Delaware & Raritan Canal, Randel received an offer to be the engineer for the eastern third of the Erie Canal, from Utica, New York to the Hudson River. Randel turned down this offer, perhaps expecting that he would be given the job of chief engineer on the Delaware & Raritan, but political considerations held up that project, which was not built until 1830–34. In the meantime, Randel relocated to his home in Albany, where, in 1821, a local lawyer asked Randel to cheaply and informally (\\"without instruments\\") survey a route for the eastern part of the Erie Canal, which would soon reach nearby Schenectady. Randel completed his survey, devised what he thought was the best route for the canal to take - which included a tunnel, a novelty in the U.S. at the time - delivered the results to the Erie Canal Commission, and published them as well. The Commissioners had not yet made a final decision on the route the canal would take in that area, and they later rebuked Randel for publishing his proposed route while a decision was still pending. Benjamin Wright Randel met with Benjamin Wright, the future \\"Father of American Civil Engineering\\", who was then the chief engineer for the central part of the canal. Wright was reviewing all the proposed routes, and Randel wanted to go over his proposed route, which Wright had apparently not seen before. Some days later Randel obtained some of Wright's calculations on the cost of soil removal, which he disputed, telling Wright so in a letter, and informing him that he planned on publishing his concerns.Holloway, pp. 184–95 When the Commissioners finally made their decision, the route they had decided on was not Randel's. Whether he was the author is not known, but a series of letters from \\"A Friend of the Canal\\" were published in a local newspaper, complaining that the process by which the route had been determined was closed: in modern terms, it was not \\"transparent\\". When the Commissioners publicly released their final report and plan, the newspaper stopped publishing the letters. Randel then published a 72-page pamphlet arguing that the route chosen by the Erie Canal Commission was made for political reasons, with evidence provided that the final route was not the best one, and detailed ideas for methods for building the section of the canal. Modern authorities differ on what Randel's motivation was for upping the ante on the debate, or whether there were multiple reasons. It appears unlikely that Randel would have published the pamphlet if he had not believed in his figures or that his route was truly the most cost-effective, and yet he had been commissioned by representatives of Albany, including the mayor, to make a survey, and Randel's proposed route favored Albany over Troy, New York. Further, Simeon De Witt, Randel's mentor and a powerful man in Albany, had paid for the publication of the pamphlet. There is no doubt that Randel's route favored Albany over Troy, but much doubt about whether he deliberately, or unconsciously, decided on such a route. On the other hand, whether Wright was deliberately favoring Troy is also debatable. Although Randel had evidence to back up his charges, they came to nothing, and had the long-term effect of making Wright his professional enemy. =The Chesapeake & Delaware Canal= A modern map of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Perhaps because of the notoriety which came to him due to the Erie Canal controversy, in 1822 Randel was engaged as a consultant to the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal. The long canal, which would cut across the northern neck of the Delmarva Peninsula, connecting the Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay and cutting 300 miles off the trip between Baltimore and Philadelphia, was proposed as early as 1661. Work on the canal had actually started in 1804, supervised by Benjamin H. Latrobe, but stopped a year later due to lack of funds, politics, topographical and labor problems. In 1822, the re-organized canal company's board of directors engaged William Strickland, an architect and civil engineer, to re-examine the route that had originally been chosen for the canal. Strickland made a slight change, but otherwise deemed the original plan to be sound, however the board of directors was not certain. They asked New York governor DeWitt Clinton to recommend an engineer, and based on this they hired Benjamin Wright to be the canal's chief engineer. They also engaged Randel to review the canal's route, and the previously suggested one which had been passed over.Holloway. pp. 198–99 After examining all the routes, Randel decided that the best one was not the \\"upper route\\" that Latrobe and chosen and Strickland had confirmed, but instead the \\"southern route\\", which was more technically challenging in that it would have to go through an ridge, and required a \\"deep cut\\", which was harder to do, but would have the advantage of opening the canal to the Atlantic Ocean, assuring it of always having enough water, a problem which the company and its staff had worried about solving.Holloway, p. 200 Latrobe and Strickland both thought that the soil where the deep cut was necessary would make a canal there extremely difficult and expensive to build, but Randel, disagreed, estimating that the cost of such a \\"tidewater canal\\" would be $1.2 million dollars; this estimate was based on the soil there being a gravelly loam. As it turned out, the soil was actually spongy and marsh-like, which added another $1 million to the cost.Randel's exact estimate was $1,211.834.74, but the canal actually cost 82% more, coming in at $2,201,864. A consulting board of engineers had estimated the cost at $1,354.364.64. Gray, pp. 51,51n The company asked the U.S. Army's Board of Engineers - the precursor to the Army Corps of Engineers - to evaluate both routes, and at the same time hired Randel's brother, William, to take samples and test the soil along both routes. Wright, the chief engineer, was keeping his options open, but was somewhat predisposed to favor the original upper route over Randel's suggested southern route.Holloway, pp. 200–01 Randel's work on the canal was interrupted in 1823 by numerous personal problems. His wife, Matilda, had fallen sick early in the year, and eventually died in August. Then Randel's father died in October. Randel himself was ill during this period, although he did not allow his own illness to get in the way of the work on the canal. Nevertheless, he was away from the project for several periods of time in 1823, and the decision about the route could not be arrived at until the Army engineers - actually a committee consisting of Brigadier General Simon Bernard and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph G. Totten from the Army Board, Canvass White, the chief engineer of the Pennsylvania State Works, and WrightGray, pp.48-49 - could meet with Randel. This finally happened in the winter, and in January 1824, the Army and the canal company unexpectedly announced that they had chosen Randel's southern route,Holloway, pp. 201–02 a choice that was published on January 31, 1824. The eastern end of the Canal Randel was hired as an engineer - his responsibility would be the eastern half of the canal, which included the \\"deep cut\\" and the 80-foot ridge, as well as bogs and marshland - and signed his contract on March 26. Since Wright was the chief engineer, Randel was his subordinate. Randel was given a deadline of four years to complete his section. He immediately advertised for and hired hundreds of workers, and commenced digging in April. As was usual for the time, Randel was paid a salary, out of which he paid his workforce, but Wright and the board of directors reduced the salary to the point that it would no longer cover the cost of labor, and Randel was forced to go into his own funds to pay the men, driving himself further into debt than he already was. One of the canal company board members, Paul Beck Jr., knowing of the injustice that was being done to Randel, and that Randel was paying out five times more than the canal was paying him, resigned from the board, later saying \\"[I]t was manifest to me that [Randel's] ruin was inevitable, and I did not choose to be accessory to it ... I believed that the board was governed by Wright, and that he had determined to ruin Randel.\\"Holloway, pp. 202–03 Randel did not allow either his illness, or the injustice being perpetrated on him by Wright, to stop work on the canal. He continued through the winter of 1824 and the following summer. Randel may have realized that Wright was trying to get him fired and ruin his reputation, and that the best way of avoiding this was to achieve the excellent results that he was noted for. Wright, however, did not stop his campaign against Randel. As the chief engineer, he was empowered to assess Randel's work, and, after inspecting it, he filed a report on July 30, 1825 which said that Randel was neglecting his duties, and had not moved a sufficient amount of dirt. In later courtroom testimony, this was determined to be an outright lie, and it was also determined that Wright had ordered his assistant to lie, and that at least one member of the canal company's board was aware of the lie and specifically approved of what Wright was doing. When word of Wright's assessment reached Randel's workforce, there was agitation among the men, so much so that one of the engineers went to the board to inquire if they were about to fire Randel, but the board denied it. Nevertheless, Randel was officially notified on September 10 of Wright's assessment of neglect of duty. He requested details from the board, but was refused, until September 19, when they met with Randel, who was given 10 days to prepare a defense, despite Randel being ill at the time. The day after Randel read his defense to the board - they had refused to allow another engineer to do so because of Randel's condition - the board fired Randel,Holloway, pp. 204–06 despite a report from two board members contradicting Wright's report, and certifying that 700 men were employed by Randel on September 27. The company also filed a lawsuit against Randel to recover money which had been loaned to him, loans which had been necessitated because Randel's fees had been reduced below the point where he could pay his subcontractors: for instance, one month Randel was paid $636 for the month, while employing as many as 100 men at a total cost of $2,500.Gray, pp. 56–57 =The lawsuit= Mathew Carey by painter John Neagle (1825) Randel filed lawsuits against the canal company for breach of contract and against Wright individually. The suit against Wright was eventually ruled as invalid, the court ruling that the dispute was actually between Randel and the company.Holloway, p. 214 In the meantime, Mathew Carey, who had been the prime mover in getting the building of the canal started again in the 1820s, came to Randel’s defense. He considered the company's treatment of the surveyor- engineer as \\"unconscionable\\" and published a number of statements and tracts defending him, starting just a week after Randel was let go. In his publications, Carey point out that Randel had spent $13,639 () of his own money to pay his workers once Wright and the company reduced his pay, and had worked for 9 months without pay. Carey also pointed out that the entire crew, including Randel, had courted disease and bad health by working throughout the winter in a frozen marsh, as demanded by the company, and that there was a better case for neglect of duty against Wright, who had spent most of the spring and summer surveying other canals. Wright indeed indicated in his letters to friends that he feared working in unhealthy conditions, and indeed had absented himself similarly while working on the Erie Canal. Furthermore, although Randel had a four-year contract with the canal to build his section, at the time he was fired he had 43% of the job, in only a little over a year. In fact, after the canal company fired Randel, they advanced the opening date of the canal a full year, to March 1827.Gray pp. 58–61 Carey's publications culminated in the 23-page Exhibit of the shocking oppression and injustice suffered for sixteen months by John Randel, Jun. Esq. However spirited Carey's defense of Randel was, in the end it came to nothing, as the board steadfastly refused to answer his charges, and Carey was unable to call a meeting of the stockholders to air the issues.Holloway, pp.207-210Carey, Mathew (1825) \\"Exhibit of the shocking oppression and injustice suffered for sixteen months by John Randel, Jun., Esq....\\" Library of CongressGray, pp. 58–59 Randel's suit against the company was heard in Delaware, as one of the two states which would charge tolls for the canal, in 1833, delays having occurred due to jurisdictional problems. Preparation for the trial put Randel even further into debt: at times he had four clerks working for him. The run-up to the trial took considerable time, as both sides filed multiple pleas and demurrers, even after the court forcefully told both parties that enough was enough. Finally, on December 9, a jury was empaneled and the trial proper began. Opening arguments took more than two weeks to complete, and numerous witnesses testified; Benjamin Wright, however, was not among them. After a deliberation which took four days, the jury returned an award to Randel of $226,885.84 in 1834 (), a tremendous amount for that time.Holloway, pp. 213–17 When the company could not pay the judgment, Randel, supported by the state of Delaware and especially the authorities of New Castle County, announced that he would attach the canal's tolls. The company had secretly told boat captains that they could pay their tolls either at the company's office in Pennsylvania, which was not legal according to the canal's charter, or at the Maryland end of the canal. This was an obvious subterfuge to avoid Randel attaching the tolls in Delaware, where he had been awarded the judgement. Nevertheless, the captains found themselves having to pay twice, once to the company, and a second time to Randel. Hundreds of the captains who refused to pay Randel's agent, William Linn Brown, were jailed by the local sheriff, and then bailed out by the company. The canal company, using two such captains as proxies, sued Randel, but the Delaware Superior Court found against them.Holloway, pp. 236–39Gray, pp. 93–94 At this point, the canal company appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States not only the most recent ruling regarding Randel's attachments, but also the original judgment of award. Unfortunately for the company, the Supreme Court upheld both verdicts. The decision has been called \\"one of the most famous lawsuits\\" in the history of the state of Delaware. In 1834, finally, nine years after he had been fired, Randel received his payment, but not until the state governments of both Maryland and Delaware passed laws requiring the canal company to pay its debts within five years.Holloway, pp. 239–40Gray pp. 96–98 The award almost put the company into bankruptcy,Koeppel, pp. 97–98 not to mention the loss of income stemming from boat captains who avoided using the canal so as not to get involved in the garnishment war between Randel and the canal company.Gray, p. 98 The final chapter in the long saga occurred when Randel accused William Linn Brown, his longtime loyal associate and the man charged with receiving the attached tolls from the canal, of taking $1000 from him, as well as power- of-attorney documents. Randel sued Brown, and Brown counter-sued. Randel lost the case at the state level in Pennsylvania in 1841, but his appeal to the Supreme Court was successful in 1844. Many of Randel's friends and associates felt that the affair did not reflect well on him.Holloway, p. 240–41 After the canal Between 1825 and 1834, while the court case was making its way through the legal system, Randel continued to work. Also, in June 1827, Randel remarried. His bride was Letitia Massey, the daughter of Philadelphia shipping merchant John Massey, and an educated woman - she attended the first school for women in the United States, the Bethlehem Female Seminary, which is now Moravian College. Letitia was to be a confidant, advisor and ally for Randel during his various litigations and business dealings, sometimes overseeing the work of Randel's assistants when he was not available to do so. The couple had at least three children, two sons and a daughter, and possible a third son. Of these only one survived to adulthood, the rest died as infants or young children.Holloway, pp. 218–22 New Castle & Frenchtown Railroad In 1827, Randel embarked on what was to be his last canal-related engagement, when he surveyed a route along the Susquehanna North Branch through difficult territory. Randel's next engagements were to be with the emerging railroad industry, beginning in 1830 when he was made chief engineer of the New Castle & Frenchtown Railroad, \\"one of the first general-purpose railroads in the United States\\" which would be a direct competitor to the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal, and Delaware's first railroad. The road took two years to build, and cut the travel time significantly. Still, contemporary experts have judged that the building of the railroad by the inexperienced Randel, overseen by the inexperienced board of directors, was \\"unprofessional and haphazard\\".Holloway, pp. 223–29Gray, pp. 60–61 Randel also worked as the chief engineer on the Ithaca and Owego Railroad, which was also completed in two years; the Central Rail Road of Georgia, a brief engagement when Randel proposed a route which the board of directors did not favor; a proposed Delaware Rail Road Company; and the New-York & Albany. He also did a survey for a railroad for the Lykens Valley Coal Company in Pennsylvania, and a topographical and hydrological survey for the city of Baltimore, which wanted to improve its source of drinking water, however Randel was not hired to construct the system, which the city determined was too expensive.Holloway, pp. 229–36; 240 Life in Randelia With his settlement from the canal company, Randel built \\"Randelia\\",Sometimes referred to as \\"Randalia\\", with an \\"a\\" instead of an \\"e\\". an estate in Cecil County, Maryland,Augustyn & Cohen, pp. 110–111Holloway, p. 246 just west of Chesapeake City, Maryland, and just south of the mouth of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which was at its largest extent.Randel bought some of the original land from James A. Bayard Jr., the chief counsel for the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company in Randel's lawsuit against the company. Holloway, p.246 There, he lived out most of the rest of his life, writing letters to newspapers in search of recognition for his work on the Manhattan grid - which he called \\"the pride and boast of [New York City]\\" - developing a plan for the extension of the grid above 155th Street; and working on other ideas. Although work did not always come Randel's way, he never stopped coming up with new ideas, such as the elevated railway, which he tried to develop well before they became a reality. Randel, who claimed to have thought of the idea of elevated trains in 1829, attempted to get permission from New York City's Board of Aldermen - the Common Council's name since 1831 - to build an elevated railway on Broadway. A committee of three evaluated the proposal, and had positive things to report about it, but recommended taking a cautious approach to such a sweeping change. They asked for models and further description and details, which Randel provided them after commissioning a cast-iron one-tenth scale model in Philadelphia at the cost of $4,000 () to $5,000 (). He invited Broadway business owners and their families to see the model, which was on display at 413 Broadway, and got a significant amount of positive press coverage. Randel's design was similar to the cable cars in San Francisco in that the trains were pulled by an endless loop of rope. There would be four lines, two uptown and two downtown, one a local and one an express each way, in a closed loop from Bowling Green to Union Square, a distance of about in each direction. Despite the great care displayed by Randel in dealing with every detail of the system, from sanitation to the privacy of those in residences along the line, the Board of Aldermen rejected Randel's idea.Holloway, pp. 282–88 Randel's plan for an elevated train on Broadway Randel did not let the rejection stop him. He got the Mechanics Institute to examine his proposal and make their evaluation public, got clearance from the chief engineer of the fire department, and altered the model slightly and re-presented it to the Board of Aldermen. He showed the model at an American Institute fair in Castle Garden and displayed a new model of the elevated railway at the New York Crystal Palace in 1853. Unfortunately for Randel, none of these efforts ended in a contract with the city to build his proposed system; it did, however, get him involved in more litigation. Randel also made a proposal to the Board for a railroad and roadway to be built above the wharves and encircle the city, which he called \\"The City Belt Railway and Depot\\" and \\"The City Belt Avenue\\", which he imagined to be about long. This plan the aldermen liked better, but still nothing came of it.Koeppel, Gerard and Smith, Caleb \\"Randel, John, Jr.\\" in p. 1084Holloway, pp. 289–93 Filing lawsuits against numerous people, as well as being sued by others, was nothing new for Randel. His lawsuits were often about money Randel thought he was owed, or debts that he was not able to pay.Holloway, pp. 244–45 On the other hand, some of the legal actions seem to be simply frivolous, such as when Randel lost a piece of jewelry and had all the workers on the estate looking for it, until someone showed up claiming to have found the pin by the river. Randel attempted to have a grand jury indict the man, but the case was dismissed. It seems clear the Randel saw the legal system as a cure-all for every problem, large or small.Holloway, p. 248 Work dried up for him, due in part to his litigious nature but also to his increasing eccentricity and self- righteousness. Even with his mentor, Simeon De Witt, to whom he owed a great deal, Randel could be petty and avaricious. In the early 1820s, Randel had taken some field books of a survey done for the state, which were therefore state property, and would not return them when De Witt asked him to, giving, for years, various excuses as to why he could not do so. De Witt died in 1834, with Randel still not having returned the books, and it took De Witt's successor as Surveyor General of New York, Orville L. Holley, until 1839, and sending an assistant surveyor to Randelia to pressure Randel in person, to get the books back. In the process, Randel received some surveying work for the state in Syracuse.Holloway, pp. 241–44 Randel attempted to make Randelia an estate that would endure after his death, but a contemporary claimed that Randel was \\"strange and eccentric, full of Utopian schemes and projects\\", and had spent his money on \\"the prosecution of wild, chimerical schemes for self- aggrandizement\\", although one of Randel's descendants described him as a \\"visionary, trying to make the world a better place\\".Holloway, pp. 248–49 Randel's last known letter was to Secretary of State John M. Clayton,Clayton was one of the lawyers representing the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company in Randel's lawsuit against the company. Gray, p. 92 dated June 22, 1849. In it, he extolled the virtues of a northern extension of New York City he was designing, to be called \\"Morrisiana\\" after Gouveneur Morris' estate. The city would have wide avenues with wide park-like medians. Randel told Clayton that Morriana would be \\"the most beautiful and comfortable suburban City you could desire to see.\\" Randel's true reason for writing Clayton, though was that he was in need of employment and urged the Secretary to think of him when work came up for which Randel would be qualified. Whatever the reason - lack of work, non-payment of fees that were owed him, or money spent on impractical schemes - Randel was clearly in financial trouble, seeking to sell off many of his assets by the early 1850s. He and his wife Letitia attempted to protect some of their property from attachment by putting it in a trust for her administered by their son. Unfortunately, some of the land included was already mortgaged to someone else. In 1854, they put the estate up for sale, but because of the encumbrances, they did not receive much money from the land they could sell. Another strange event, a lawsuit filed in New York in 1856 in which Letitia sued Randel through her trustee, their son, for $1,390, may have been intended to scare off creditors. In 1858, some of their possessions were seized by Cecil County to pay off longstanding debts owed to a neighbor; several months later, their son, John M Randel, died at the age of 27, possibly from yellow fever. In 1859, Randel and Letitia filed a lawsuit in Maryland the intent of which was to get back some of their land. When they lost the case they again appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected it, saying that it \\"lacked definition\\".Holloway, pp. 249–52; 293 Randel tried once again in 1863 to interest the New York City Board of Aldermen in a project. He offered to make a series of 1,472 maps of Manhattan at a scale 16 times larger than the Farm Maps. The Board seemed interested, and at first recommended hiring Randel, but eventually, even with the backing of mayor Charles Godfrey Gunther, the petition failed to be approved. The city clerk, David T. Valentine, nonetheless convinced Randel to write a 10-page essay about his work on the Manhattan grid, \\"City of New York, north of Canal street, in 1808 to 1821\\", which is the only narrative by Randel on the subject.Holloway, pp. 293–94 \\"I am a ruined man\\", Randel had written at the age of 48, while still trying to collect his judgment from the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company, and when he died of \\"brain inflammation\\" - possibly encephalitis or typhus - on August 2, 1865 in Albany at the age of 77, he was insolvent. His grave has not been located, but it is said that he was buried in the First Presbyterian Church of Orange where he married his first wife, Mathilda; Letitia went to live with Randel's nephew in New Jersey. The property that had been called \\"Randelia\\" is still farmland, and as of 2013, Randel's house, expanded and modernized, is still extant.Koeppel, p.98Holloway, pp. 251–52; 294; 328 n.18 Professional associations At various times in his life Randel was a member of the Albany Society for the Promotion of Useful Arts, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Institute of the City of New York, and the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. In 1815, he was asked to give several lectures on mnemonics, and probably possessed an eidetic (or \\"photographic\\") memory.Holloway, pp. 25–26 References Informational notes Citations Bibliography * *Gray, Ralph D.

It published data, information, and intelligence related to obesity, overweight, and their underlying causes. NOO is now part of [Public Health England] who now carry out their work. NOO worked closely with a wide range of organisations to assist policy makers and practitioners who were involved in understanding and tackling obesity at population level. It did this through analysing and interpreting research and data to produce reports and briefings. To support these activities it also produced analytical and data visualisation tools. These are used, for example, to map obesity and associated determinants at national, regional and local levels. Members of NOO were instrumental in establishing the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP). Analysis and interpretation of the NCMP dataset is a core element of NOO's work. NOO is a member of the Association of Public Health Observatories. Standard evaluation framework The Standard Evaluation Framework (SEF) for weight management interventions was published by the NOO in 2009. It comprises a guidance document in three parts: an introductory guide to evaluation; a table listing essential and desirable data to be collected; and a detailed description of each data item in the table.http://www.noo.org.uk/core/frameworks The SEF is intended to help people to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. The aim of the SEF is to increase the number and quality of evaluations and this in turn will support the generation of evidence-based practice. The SEF was developed following extensive consultation with a wide range of interested parties, including practitioners, academic experts, and representatives from public health observatories, regional public health groups, primary care trusts and other relevant organisations. The SEF lists the minimum data necessary for a meaningful evaluation; alongside these it also lists a further set of desirable data that would enhance the evaluation. Supporting material explains the reasons behind these classifications and provides guidance on how to collect data. The SEF also provides basic guidance on how to conduct an evaluation for people with limited experience in this area. The SEF can be used with a range of interventions including those conducted with individuals on a one-to-one basis or in groups, and in clinical and community settings. It is not intended for use with surgical and medicinal approaches to weight management, or in broader programmes that include changes to the built environment. The SEF is very much a work in progress, and will itself be subject to an evaluation.

DCL (10 May 1854 – 28 December 1918) was a British peer and Senior Freemason. Education He was born, on 10 May 1854, as the son of Sir Henry Morgan Vane at Durham. In his youth he was educated at Eton College. Following in the family tradition, he went up to the University of Oxford in about 1873, reading for a BA at Brasenose College and attaining the degree in 1876. After three years of training he became a barrister being called to the bar by the Inner Temple; although it is unlikely he ever practised as a barrister. Marriage and children On 28 June 1881, he married Lady Catharine Sarah Cecil, daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Exeter, at St Thomas Marylebone, and had three living sons, one of them predeceasing him. He also served in the Northamptonshire Militia between 1876 and 1884. His heir apparent was his second son, Christopher Vane, 10th Baron Barnard MC who served in the Westmorland and Cumberland Yeomanry being wounded in action and decorated in World War I. Lord Barnard's first son, the Hon. Henry Cecil Vane, was badly wounded in France and subsequently died from his wounds. Civil Service career Although the son of a minor member of the aristocracy, Lord Barnard did not expect to inherit Raby Castle as he was not directly in the line of succession. Therefore, he pursued a career in the civil service at the Charity Commission between 1881 and 1891. He was promoted to the Private Secretary to the Chief Commissioner in 1885 and served in that post until 1890. Elevation to the peerage In 1891 the former 4th Duke of Cleveland died, leaving the line of succession to the dukedom unclear. The case was decided in 1892 when the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords held him to be the 9th Baron Barnard and inheritor of the vast estates of Raby although he did not inherit the title of Duke of Cleveland which became extinct.http://thepeerage.com/p7103.htm Lord Barnard therefore left the Charity Commission to concentrate on the management of the estate. Contemporary sources describe him in this role as: > [winning] the hearts of all by his unaffected kindliness and consideration, > and by the interest he evinced in everything that concerned the welfare of > his estates and neighbours. Masonic career Lord Barnard's masonic career commenced in 1874 when he was initiated into Apollo University Lodge No. 357 while studying at the University of Oxford. When in London he became a member of Lodge of Friendship No. 6, where one of the members was John Fawcett who was Provincial Grand Master of Durham at the time. His association with the Province of Durham commenced during 1892 when he joined Rose of Raby Lodge No. 1650 at Staindrop. This was the village nearest to his Raby Castle home. Two years later he was installed as master. Subsequent masonic accolades followed when in 1895 he was appointed Provincial Senior Grand Warden for the Province of Durham and in the same year appointed Junior Grand Warden of the United Grand Lodge of England. He joined Lambton Lodge No.375 and was installed as Master shortly afterwards. He became a member and Past Master of the distinguished Royal Alpha Lodge No.16 into which Prince Arthur of Connaught was initiated. On the death of Hedworth Williamson during 1900, Lord Barnard was appointed Provincial Grand Master of Durham. His legal training and business skills vastly improved the organisation of freemasonry in north east England, with membership increasing from 3,330 to 9,000 during his tenure. Two lodges, Lord Barnard Lodge No. 2935 at South Shields (consecrated during 1902) and Vane Lodge No.3110 at Bishop Auckland (consecrated in 1905) were named in his honour. Honours and accolades Lord Barnard held the honorary position of Colonel 4th (Special Reserve) Battalion Durham Light Infantry, the Chairman of the Tees Fishery Board and was a governor of Shrewsbury School. He was a member of Brooks's and the Oxford and Cambridge Club. As with the fashion of the time, he kept two houses, his provincial home being Raby Castle, Darlington and a residence for the London season at 20 Belgrave Square, SW. He was also awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) from the University of Durham in September 1901. Death In November 1917, following the death of his first son in France, Lady Barnard fell ill and died on 16 March 1918. Lord Barnard died shortly thereafter on 28 December 1918, his funeral was held New Year's Eve. A masonic memorial service was held at Durham Cathedral, at which the Dean of Durham stated: > [he] succeeded by inheritance to a great position upon which it had not been > possible for him with complete certainty to reckon. He accepted it in the > simple spirit of duty and made best use of it while life and health were > his, for the good of his fellow citizens.

Located in a tectonic basin, this lake was the largest natural lake in Catalonia before being drained in the nineteenth century. History The original surface of the ancient lake was around 7 km², therefore it appears larger than Lake Banyoles in the ancient cartography of Catalonia.Cataloniae Principatus novissima et accurata descriptio ICC The lake was located in a tectonic depression without natural drainage. The highly seasonal rivers of Riera de Vallcanera, Riera de Santa Maria, Rec Sorrer, El Reclar, Riera de Pins and la Torderola contributed with their waters to fill Lake Sils basin. The surface of the lake was most likely subject to periodical variations, reaching its lowest level at the height of the summer in periods of drought when inflow reached a minimum and evaporation was high. As in most wetlands in Europe in the past, the Sils Lake was seen as an unhealthy area, a focus of maladies. There were several attempts to drain the lake in the past centuries, but these were not successful. Finally in 1851, as part of a campaign against malaria and to promote agricultural development, a long canal was built leading to the Riera de Santa Coloma —a tributary of the Tordera River— and the waters of the lake ebbed away. The lands that were obtained through the desiccation of the lake area were distributed among the people who had built the drainage canal. As time went by the lake basin filled mainly with hay fields that were cut in order to store hay for the local cattle in the winter. Towards the last quarter of the 20th century, when cattle-rearing was on the wane in the region, the hayfields gave way to poplar and hybrid plane plantations for commercial use.Estany de Sils - Una breu història =Maps= Sils Lake is represented clearly in the following ancient maps, among others: * \\"Cataloniae principatus descriptio nova\\" by Gerard Mercator, 1619 * \\"Catalonia de Guiljelmus Blaeu excud.\\", Amsterdam, 1632 *\\"Cataloniae principatus et Ruscinonis ac Cerretaniae comitatuum exactissima dilineatio, cura et studio de Matthäus Seutter\\", 1740 *\\"Cataloniae principatus, nec non Ruscinonensis et Cerretaniae Comitatus in eorum vicariatus peraccurae distincti de Nicolaum Visser\\" *\\"Cataloniae Principatus novissima et accurata descriptio\\" by J.B. Vrients, 1608 Ecology Nowadays there are a few vestiges of the former lake as marshes and seasonal ponds in the area formerly occupied by Lake Sils. These are partly a fruit of the effort of a 1998 project called \\"Life\\" under which some of the former hayfields are being restored by buying private land. The final and most ambitious part of the project is to reestablish a permanent lake and recreate some of the local forest that had formerly grown at the edges of the ancient lake. This project is under the 'Natural Interest Areas Plan', Pla d'Espais d'Interès Natural (PEIN) of the Generalitat, and is part of the Natura 2000 ecological network of protected areas in the territory of the European Union.Pàgina oficial de l'estany de Sils =Species= There are many different species of birds in the few marshes remaining in the area. These were probably part of the original fauna of the lake that disappeared. Among the herpetological fauna, the Mediterranean Painted Frog, the Palmate Newt, the European pond terrapin and the small snake Natrix maura deserve mention. It is difficult to know which fishes inhabited the waters of the ancient lake. The incertitude is largely based on the introduction of exotic species, such as common carp, crucian carp and Gambusia rather than to the probable extinction of some original local species. Besides the exotic species, nowadays the European chub and European eel are common in the present remaining wetlands and rivulets.Fauna i flora exòtiques a l'estany de Sils The population of three- spined stickleback in the remaining water bodies of the ancient lake is the only presence of this species in the area of the Tordera basin.

The couple have stated that they started the band as a way to spend more time together, and while they released a number of recordings and went on tours as a duo, they consider Midnight Sun, released in April 2014, their first real record. Their tour to support the release of the album in May and June 2014 included opening for Beck as he started the East Coast leg of his tour that year. History The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger was formed in 2008 by musician Sean Lennon and his girlfriend, musician/model Charlotte Kemp Muhl. The name of the band is from a short story once written by Muhl. Kemp and Lennon met in 2004 at the Coachella Music Festival. In an interview with the UK publication The Daily Telegraph, Lennon commented on their relationship: \\"Charlotte hadn’t even heard \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" when I met her,\\" Lennon said. \\"And she knew nothing about my mum. Her parents thought I was just a delinquent, by virtue of association with the famous hippie delinquents. So it was nice because it was like a bridging of gaps and a collision of galaxies.\\" Both Lennon and Muhl are multi-instrumentalists. Among the instruments the band uses, are the guitar, drums, and also the bayan. Muhl, also a successful model, has been featured in Maybelline campaigns, as well as Jennifer Lopez's clothing brand J Lo. She uses funds from her modeling work to fund her musical endeavours. Sean Lennon performing with The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger at The Saint in Asbury Park, NJ in September 2013 =Jardin Du Luxembourg= Grammy Award winning record producer Mark Ronson collaborated with The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger to produce a single in 2010: Jardin Du Luxembourg backed with Comic Strip. Ronson stated: \\"It's a 1960s psych thing, quite Brazilian, with Sean and his girlfriend singing in unison.\\" =Acoustic Sessions= Acoustic Sessions, was released in late October 2010 through their own label, Chimera Music, and was recorded in their own home studio.' Lennon told Spinner that it's supposed to convey to listeners the idea of hearing them alone in a living room: \\"It's almost rough sounding, but hopefully in a charming way. It's mostly acoustic guitar, some piano, some vibraphone.\\" Reception Acoustic Sessions was released to generally positive reviews: In October 2010, the Canadian publication The Globe and Mail rated Acoustic Sessions its Disc of the Week: \\"The album charms like a countryside circus. You wonder if the Hendersons will all be there, late of Pablo Fanque’s fair – what a scene, you bet.\\" In the November 2010 issue of Rolling Stone a reviewer described their sound as \\"sunny\\" and psychedelic, and gave it a rating of 3.5 stars out of 5. A reviewer for NPR had the following to say about Acoustic Sessions: \\"Listening to Acoustic Sessions is like stepping into a magical world where a smiling sun shines on fields of dancing flowers while winged creatures flit about in the fragrant air.\\" =La Carotte Bleue= La Carotte Bleue was available at live shows and on their website. It featured a more electronic sound than their previous album and included many re-workings of songs from Acoustic Sessions. Both tracks from the Jardin Du Luxembourg single were also included on this release. =Midnight Sun= Years in development and previewed first on NPR's First Listen, Midnight Sun was released on April 29, 2014 on Chimera Music and received strong critical response. A departure from their previous more acoustic efforts, critics were almost universally positive about the album, with Metacritic giving it a composite 82 rating. “Midnight Sun positively slays,” NME's Jeremy Allen opined in his 8/10 review, summarizing: “Midnight scorchio, more like.” Gregory Heaney’s four out of five star review in Allmusic wrote: “With its eclectic instrumentation and crunchy production (mixed by the master himself, Dave Fridmann), Lennon and Muhl create a musical landscape where seemingly anything can happen.” And Luke O'Neil in the Boston Globe described Midnight Sun as “an accomplished, enjoyable record from start to finish, regardless of references or lineage.” Other reviews include: *Mojo - April 28, 2014\\\\- \\"Out-of-body transmissions that channel Bends-era Radiohead, Syd Barrett whimsy and woozy melodic weirdness. 4 stars \\" * The Independent, UK - 25 April 2014 \\"[L]urking behind the cosmicity, there’s usually a solid pop hook.\\" *Zachary Houle - PopMatters - May 15, 2014 \\"Midnight Sun is a near perfect album. It remains wholly consistent, and evokes a certain time and era of music that doesn’t often get heard very much anymore.\\" *Rolling Stone - Will Hermes - April 29, 2014 “[L]ike a playful mix of Sixties and Seventies tropes. Overall, the set could use some emotional weight to match the level of wit and craft. Composition A substantially more electrified album than their previous efforts but with a wide range of styles within its dozen songs, Midnight Sun is a unique, diverse album that is both retro and forward leaning, with clear psychedelic rock and neo-psychedelia influences that fans and critics have pointed to including the Beatles during their pre and post Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band period, the Rolling Stones' Their Satanic Majesties Request, as well as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and, because of their harmonies, the Beach Boys, as well as contemporary artists such as Beck, Flaming Lips and Tame Impala. In a 2014 interview, Kemp Muhl cited Jimi Hendrix, Syd Barrett and Bach as influences. In an interview with the Boston Herald in June 2014, Lennon stated \\"It’s easy to hear influences like the Beatles and Pink Floyd, but honestly we’re inspired by more than what you’d expect,” Lennon said. “Miles Davis, Stravinsky, film and narrative play a role. A lot of people hear that it’s a psychedelic record and think it sounds like ’67 to ’70. To some degree, that’s true, but there’s more to it.\\" Production Recorded at The Farm in Delaware County, New York by Matthew Cullen and Andris Balins, Kemp Muhl stated in an interview to support the album: “Midnight Sun we consider our first real record, it's the one we spent the most time on. We brought in Dave Fridmann (Tame Impala, Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, MGMT) to mix it and that made a huge difference. Everything else we did ourselves.” Eleven of the twelve songs on the album were produced by The GOASTT, with the exception of Johanessburg, which was produced by Mark Ronson. Kemp Muhl indicated in the same interview with the Vancouver Courier, that she and Lennon played the majority of the instruments and she played the bass, keyboards and some guitar, but they brought the new band members in for some overdubs. All vocals on the album are by Lennon and Kemp Muhl and all songs written by them except Golden Earring, which was written by Evans, Livingston, and Young. Additional notes *Xanadu YouTube Mix *Animals on Letterman, May 3, 2014 *Animals Official Video- Director's Cut on Vimeo *\\"Golden Earrings\\", the only cover on the album was originally from a 1947 movie Golden Earrings that Peggy Lee turned into a hit and was later covered by the band Gandalf in the late 1960s. *In an interview with Jessie Opoien of The Capital Times, Lennon tells how he likes the narrative of \\"Don't Look Back Orpheus,\\" describing him as \\"the Johnny B. Goode, the Jimi Hendrix, the Ziggy Stardust of ancient Greece.\\" They had recently purchased an air-powered organ that they called Calliope, which is the name of Orpheus' mother, and used Calliope to play through the song, with keyboard player Jared Samuel, adding a solo to the song. Midnight Sun Tour Just after the release of the album, The GOASTT embarked on a tour of twenty-seven venues in the U.S. and Canada beginning May 2 and running to the Mountain Jam Festival in Hunter, NY on June 8, 2014. This would be followed by an additional nine dates in the eastern U.S. and Canada, seven of which opened for Beck. They continued to tour in 2015, headlining venues and eventually opening for Primus as well as Florence and the Machine In addition to Lennon and Kemp Muhl, The GOASTT road band includes members of the Brooklyn-based Invisible Familiars, with drummer Tim Kuhl, Jared Samuel on keyboards, and Robbie Mangano on guitars. Review of the Denver Concert: “Teetering between a darkly groovy psych vibe to ’70s funk to Brian Wilson-inspired vocal harmonies, the band covered a wide range of sonic territory...Lennon closed with a gorgeous rendition of the Hendrix classic “Little Wing” that sent the exuberant crowd out into warm summer night with big smiles.\\" GOASTT often finished their sets with the Syd Barrett tune \\"Long Gone\\" S. Victor Aaron in Something Else Reviews wrote: \\"The Ghost of A Saber Tooth Tiger brings the full band to bear on the song, busting out of the tune’s seams with heavy tones from guitars, Muhl’s organ and Tim Kuhl’s discriminating drums as the song descends into the metal bombast waiting at the end the chorus.\\" Charity The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger played a benefit concert in August 2010, with all the proceeds going to support the Woodstock Animal Sanctuary in New York. Discography *Acoustic Sessions (2010) *Midnight Sun (2014) Media response The Ghost Of A Saber Tooth Tiger Sean Lennon & Charlotte Kemp Muhl at Union Hall in Brooklyn; Oct 2010 taken by Charlene Aqualina With the release of Midnight Sun in April 2014, The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger received substantial media coverage in a variety of publications and online media, exploring the nature of their music, relationship and how the band connects to Lennon's musical heritage. Prior to that GOASTT appeared in a two-page spread in Vanity Fair, where they were photographed by famed French photographer Patrick Demarchelier. In the article Lennon described the musical relationship with Kemp as having parallels to the relationship between his father John Lennon and writing partner Paul McCartney, and said his writing relationship with Kemp is like \\"intellectual tennis\\". In Italian Vogue, a reviewer described their sound as \\"soft and dreamy and evokes 60s French Pop and Folk Pops' Bohemian Gypsie atmosphere.\\" For the fall 2010 issue of Purple, Lennon and Kemp recreated the iconic picture of John Lennon and Yoko Ono taken by famous photographer Annie Leibovitz for the cover of Rolling Stone in 1981. The picture of Kemp and Lennon was taken by photographer Terry Richardson. In Rolling Stone magazine, Lennon told interviewer Austin Scaggs about the musical dynamics of his relationship with Kemp, juxtaposed with that of John Lennon and Yoko Ono: \\"They were unified as a message and a movement, but she didn't want to write songs with my dad. ... [Kemp and I] love to collaborate. We just have a chemistry.\\" They have also performed on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Conan.

The Kamuku language belongs to the Kainji family and is related to C'lela, Duka, and Kambari. They mainly live in the west-central region of Nigeria, particularly in Kwara State. Their population in 1996 exceeded 35,000 people, found in the Sokoto division of Sokoto State, the Birnin Gwari division of Kaduna State and the Kontagora and Minna divisions of Niger State. The Kamuku may have been the dominant people of the kingdom of Kankuma (also Kwangoma or Kangoma), a people whom Al-Makrizi (d.1442) called Karuku in his book The Races of the Sudan. One historian speculates that Kankuma may have been the precursor to the Hausa state of Zaria. The Gazetteers of the Northern Provinces of Nigeria: The Central Kingdoms, published in the early 1920s, described the Kamuku people as industrious agriculturalists who keep livestock, are of a somewhat timid and retiring nature and are thoroughly amenable to authority. They did not seem to recognize a central authority above the level of a village head. The Kamuku share some customs with the neighboring Gwari people, such as shaking peas in a tortoise shell and drawing marks according to the result so as to divine the future.

Friedlaender (28 June 1873 in Bromberg – 28 May 1956 in Twickenham) was a German lawyer. After passing the legal exam in 1898 in Munich, Friedlaender was admitted to the bar the following year. Friedlaender is known for his leading commentary on the German Bar Code (Rechtsanwaltsordnung), which was later expanded to include a lawyers' code of honour, the predecessors of modern formulations of professional responsibilities and duties. Due to his Jewish heritage, his bar license was withdrawn under the Nazi regime and Friedlaender fled to England in 1938.

As well as the United Kingdom, InsureandGo also has operations in the Republic of Ireland and Australia. In 2018, InsureandGo reported providing 3.1 million travel insurance policies to UK customers, an increase of 1 million over the previous year. History InsureandGo was founded in 2000 in Braintree, Essex, United Kingdom, where they were based for the next six years. In November 2005, InsureandGo claimed to be one of the first companies to remove the terrorism exclusion clause from their policies. InsureandGo also said that they had led the travel insurance market in doing this and urged other companies to do the same. Due to the company's expansion, InsureandGo relocated to new offices in Southend-on-Sea in 2006, with the effect of bringing new jobs to the area. The company had bought Southend-based Travel Claims Services in September of the previous year. In December 2006, InsureandGo hired chartered accountants BDO Stoy Hayward to explore its options, including the possibility of selling the company for a reported £100 million. In August 2009, InsureandGo began giving customers the chance to offset their carbon emissions when they purchase a travel insurance policy. The company launched a new product called travel dispute cover in early 2010. The cover, which could be purchased in addition to one of InsureandGo's travel insurance policies, provided legal assistance to travellers who had a contract breached by their tour operators, travel agents or hoteliers. In May 2013, InsureandGo sponsored a one-day event in London called 'The World on Regent Street'. The event included activities and displays from a range of different countries, including China, Argentina, Trinidad and Tobago and Turkey. During the summer of 2014, InsureandGo gave away free ice cream at London's Canary Wharf and the South Bank as part of its 'Around the World in 80 Scoops' event. The ice cream was manufactured by Southend-based Rossi Ice Cream, and featured strange flavours which had been inspired by different countries. In November 2015, it was announced that InsureandGo would be relocating most of its UK operations to Bristol. =Going international= In early 2010, InsureandGo launched a range of travel insurance products for residents of Australia. In October 2011, InsureandGo launched in the Republic of Ireland. =Purchase by MAPFRE ASISTENCIA= Spanish insurance company MAPFRE ASISTENCIA purchased InsureandGo in October 2010 for an undisclosed sum. InsureandGo is now a wholly owned subsidiary of MAPFRE Asistencia Compañia Internacional de Seguros y Reaseguros Sociedad Anonima, which forms part of the MAPFRE Group. Awards and recognition InsureandGo was named in the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 list, which ranks Britain's fastest growing privately held companies by growth in sales over the previous 3 years. They were included in the list in 2005 and 2006. In 2008, InsureandGo was awarded twice at the Fast Growth Business Awards. The company was named the T-Mobile Fast Growth Business of the Year and was also named Online Business of the Year. InsureandGo was voted Best Travel Insurance Provider For Customer Service and Most Trusted Travel Insurance Provider at the Moneywise Customer Service Awards 2009. InsureandGo was chosen as TNT Magazine's 'Favourite Insurance Provider' in their Golden Backpack Awards 2012. At The Travel Marketing Awards 2016, InsureandGo won a Silver award for Best Radio Advertising.

This election was the first that Burma had had in 20 years. The attacks were significantly larger than attacks against Estonia and Georgia in 2007 and 2008 respectively. The attack followed a similar one on 1 February 2010, and also followed an incident of a total loss of connection to the internet the previous spring when a submarine communications cable was severed accidentally. Attacks beginning 25 October 2010 Over the period of a week, a large-scale massive DDoS attack targeted Burma's main Internet provider, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunication. Successful attacks to this network interfered with the majority of all incoming and outgoing network traffic. The motivation for the attacks, and hence the culprits, were unclear, but there was significant speculation that blamed the Burmese government for a pre- emptive attack to disrupt Internet access just before the general elections. The ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), was known for denying universal human rights such as freedom expression; the government's efforts to silence dissent are extended to cyberspace, and it has one of the most restrictive systems of Internet control in Asia. The fact that international observers and foreign journalists were not being allowed into the country to cover the polls raised suspicions that Burma's military authorities could have been trying to restrict the flow of information over the election period. Technical details A DDoS attack attempts to flood an information gateway with data exceeding its bandwidth. The \\"distributed\\" element of a Distributed Denial of Service means that it involves PCs spread all over the world. These enslaved computers, called \\"botnets,\\" are usually home computers that have been hijacked and compromised by a virus. Botnets are usually rented out by cyber criminals for various purposes, which includes web attacks. They can be controlled from across the internet. The size of the October–November 2010 attacks increased daily from 0.5 to 10-15 Gbit/s, each daily attack lasting over eight hours (always during regular office hours), from computers across the globe. This was several hundred times more than enough to overwhelm the country's 45 Mbit/s T3 terrestrial and satellite links. Attacks on blogging websites in September were also on the order of Gbit/s. By comparison, the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia were at most 90 Mbit/s, lasting between a minute to over 10 hours. Cyberattacks in Burma prior to the 2010 election This cyber attack notably followed a similar one on 1 February 2010, when the internet link service of Myanmar's Yatanarpon Teleport Company was struck, and also followed the incident of a total loss of connection to the internet the previous spring when a submarine communications cable was severed accidentally. Despite the heavy hand that the regime wields over cyberspace, information communication technologies (ICTs) have provided Burmese opposition groups the means to challenge the government by broadcasting their message to the world. There has been an ongoing battle between the liberation technologies and the authoritarian government. In 2000, Burmese political activists received numerous e-mails that contained viruses, which many believe were part of an organised campaign perpetrated by state agents. The first major example of a DDoS attack in Burma was in 2007, during the Saffron Revolution when Burmese activists managed to put videos and pictures of the demonstrations and government crackdown on the internet, at which time the government severed the internet connection for almost two weeks. Near the one-year anniversary of the Saffron Revolution, the websites of three main Burmese independent media organisations were attacked and effectively silenced. The Democratic Voice of Burma and The Irrawaddy were made inaccessible through a DDoS attack, and the website for Mizzima News was defaced. Through 2009 and 2010, attacks on Burmese opposition media sites continued periodically. The timing of these attacks and the nature of the websites being attacked indicate a political connection. Although the identity of the attackers remain unknown, it is widely believed that the government played a role. This belief is still held, because the Burmese government has consistently made efforts to control and censor the communications environment of the country. Also, the timing and co-ordination of these attacks being around the anniversary of the Saffron Revolution suggests that the motivation of them was to prevent the websites from commemorating the protests and possibly mobilising new political actions. In September 2010, coinciding with the third anniversary of the Saffron Revolution, the websites belonging to independent and opposition news sites and blogs were brought down by DDoS attacks similar to, but less powerful than, the ones that took place prior to the election. On 27 September 2010, DDoS was used specifically against two news websites in Burma: the Democratic Voice of Burma and The Irrawaddy Magazine. Both of these magazines were providers of independent coverage of current affairs in Burma. These attacks were believed to originate from the Burmese government, and with the election a month away, media workers feared that this attack was a test run leading up to the election. In 2009, Burma ranked 171 out of 175 countries in the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) Press Freedom Index.

Life and career He was born in rural East Mapleton, Nova Scotia, son of Augusta Bird, a school teacher in East Mapleton and Stephen Bird. A few years later his mother was left a widow with two stepsons and three sons as his father died of pneumonia. As he became a teenager, the family moved to the nearby town of Amherst, where his mother began running a boarding house. The family at this time was in need of money, so Will and his brother were unable to complete school. By the time he was twenty-three he decided to go to Alberta and work on the harvest to earn money. This was the case for many men from the East who were recruited to harvest crops on the prairies (see Harvest excursion). Soon afterwards, war broke out in Europe and Will's youngest brother, Stephen, was enlisted, only to be killed in France a year afterward. Bird had volunteered for service overseas at the same time as his brother, but was rejected due to his poor teeth. Will Bird returned home to Nova Scotia, wanting to take up his brother's place in the military, and he enlisted immediately. By this point in the war, the Canadian Expeditionary Force's standards for dental health had been lowered; although Bird was required to have some teeth removed in Britain before being sent to the front in France. He served in France and Belgium at the front for two years with the Canadian Expeditionary Force (42nd Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), CEF). His time in the war impacted his life as a writer as his war experiences were constantly a part of his stories. One of his finest works,\\"[And We Go On] stands among the most powerful Canadian reactions to the Great War\\", Ian McKay and Robin Bates, In the Province of History, McGill-Queens University Press, 2010, p. 154 And We Go On (1930) documents his time in France. Another book, Ghosts Have Warm Hands recounts his experiences during the war and his emotional connection to his brother, Stephen, who was killed in action before Bird was allowed to volunteer for service. Once he was demobilized in 1919 he returned to the village of Southampton, Nova Scotia, where he married Ethel Sutton. Together they had two children, Stephen and Betty. Will had become a partner in a general store there, but the store failed in 1923 and the family moved back to Amherst. There he found employment in the post office. While living in Southampton, he wrote his first story and won a newspaper essay contest; this was the beginning to his career as an author and in 1928 he decided to support his family by writing. His stories were accepted across North America by such magazines as the Saturday Evening Post, Toronto Star Weekly, Family Herald, Maritime Advocate and Weekly Star. His first book, A Century at Chignecto, was published in 1928 and was followed by a steady succession of fiction and non-fiction titles over the next 40 years. In 1931 he was sent back to the battlefields of France by Maclean's Magazine to write a series called \\"Thirteen Years After\\". The series became a lecture tour and a book, published by MacLean's in 1931 and over the following five years was given to Canadian Legion branches throughout the Maritimes.and even, according to one source, elsewhere in Canada: see Dean Jobb, \\"Neglected Master Bird Offers Compelling Narrative of WWI\\", Halifax Chronicle-Herald, July 5, 2015, http://thechronicleherald.ca/books/1297325-neglected-master-bird-offers- compelling-narrative-of-wwi In 1933 he began work at the Nova Scotia Tourist Bureau, moving to Halifax in 1938, and he worked as chairman of the Historic Sites and Monuments Advisory Council, remaining there until his retirement in 1966. When Canada went to war again in 1939, Bird lost his only son, Captain Stephen Stanley Bird, of the North Nova Scotia Highlanders. This caused him to enter a long period of writing, creating many stories that showed his grief. Bird won the Ryerson Fiction Award twice, in 1945 for Here Stays Good Yorkshire and in 1947 for Judgment Glen. Bird was president of the Canadian Authors Association from 1949 to 1950, and was succeeded by W. G. Hardy. Bird died on January 28, 1984, in Sackville, New Brunswick.http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/will-r-bird/ Books =Non-fiction= Maritime history *A Century at Chignecto (1928, story of Beaubassin) *Historic Nova Scotia (1935) *Done at Grand Pre (1955, story of the Expulsion of the Acadians) War and military history *And We Go On (1930, World War I) *Private Timothy Fergus Clancy (1930) *Thirteen Years After (1931, memoir) *The Communication Trench (1932, trench warfare) *The Two Jacks (1954, story of two Canadian heroes of the French Resistance) *No retreating footsteps (1955, regimental history of the North Novas) *The North Shore Regiment (1963) *Ghosts Have Warm Hands (1968, reissue of And We Go On) Travel *This is Nova Scotia (1950) *Off-Trail in Nova Scotia (1956) *These Are the Maritimes (1959) =Fiction= War *Private Timothy Fergus Clancy (1930, novel) Historical fiction *The Maid of the Marshes (1933, privately printed) *Here Stays Good Yorkshire (1945, Ryerson Fiction Award, co-winner 1945) *Judgment Glen (1947) *The Passionate Pilgrim (1949) *So Much to Record (1951) *To Love and To Cherish (1954) *The Shy Yorkshireman (1955) *Tristram's Salvation (1957) *Despite the Distance (1961) *An Earl Must Have a Wife (1969, semi-fictional account of J.F.W.

Royce, who sold it to the Sheraton Corporation in 1954. It was subsequently renamed the Huntington-Sheraton Hotel. As a Sheraton, much of the hotel's interior period detailing was covered over, and the Lanai Building was constructed next to the swimming pool in 1967. Sheraton sold the hotel to Keikyu U.S.A., Inc. in 1974, but continued to manage the property.http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2015/03/30/the-langham-huntington- hotel-from-girls-just-want-to-have-fun/ In the wake of the disastrous 1985 Mexico City earthquake, seismic tests conducted on the hotel showed the main building to be unsafe.

The contents of the main building were sold to the public in June and July 1988 and demolition of the main building began on March 27, 1989, lasting three months. The lanai and cottages closed in mid-1990 as construction of the new main building progressed. During the demolition and reconstruction of the main wing, the two historic ballrooms, the Viennese Ballroom (originally the hotel's dining room) and the Georgian Ballroom (originally the hotel's theater) were retained and incorporated into the new hotel, in addition to the other outbuildings such as the pool, lanai and bungalows, which were not required to be demolished. The $100-million reconstruction project revealed 10 stained-glass windows made of opalescent glass in the Georgian Ballroom, which had been covered over by the Sheraton Corporation in 1954 when the space was converted into a dining room.

He has been buried in the cimetière parisien de Bagneux. Biography Sam Szafran was born in Paris in 1934, a son of Polish Jewish immigrants. He grew up in the Quartier des Halles. As a child, he knew that art was what he wanted to do. During World War II he was hidden in the countryside and later in Switzerland, but returned to Paris in 1944 to live with his mother. He was captured there by the Nazis and sent to a camp in Drancy. Roman, p. 67 He was freed by the Americans and then left Europe, spending four years in Australia. He returned to Paris in 1951. Following abstract beginnings at the Atelier de la Grande Chaumière, where the young artist studied under Henri Goetz, he discovered pastel in the early 1960s. During the postwar period he encountered as well Jean Arp, Yves Klein, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Joan Mitchell, Alberto Giacometti, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Martine Franck. In 1963 he married the Swiss-born Lilette Keller, and their son Sébastien was born the following year. After spending several years in studios provided by their friends, they finally moved to Malakoff in 1974.Vgl. Jean Clair, Sam Szafran, Genf 1996. Artwork The discovery of the pastel was of great significance to Sam Szafran. Since the beginning of the 1960s he has been using the pastel chalks of \\"Pastels Roché\\" which were fabricated based on the family recipe by the three sisters of the Roché-family at the Maison du Pastel. From now on this technique has been dominating his work either alone or in combination with charcoal or watercolor. At the same time the themes of his paintings intensified as well.Vgl. Daniel Marchesseau, Le Pavillon Szafran, Fondation Pierre Gianadda, Martigny, 2005. The numerous series of staircases, jungle-like greenhouses and studios (\\"Ateliers\\") are the result of his obsession with mastering perfectly the somewhat anachronistic technique of pastel. By focusing on figurative themes and technical precision this kind of painting contradicts most of the abstract and gestural tendencies of contemporary art; this is an art beyond concepts, trends and ephemeral styles. As a result, the artist’s work has rarely been seen in exhibitions and almost exclusively in his home country and in Switzerland. The artist's studio In 1993, he received the Grand Prix des Arts de la Ville de Paris. First retrospectives were organized by Jean Clair and Jean-Louis Prat in 1999 and 2000 at the Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Martigny/ Switzerland and at the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Vence. The first exhibition in a Paris Museum was held in 2001 at the Musée de la Vie romantique (\\"L'atelier dans l'atelier\\"). In 2008, two of his pastels were shown at the exhibition \\"Le mystère et l'éclat / Mystery and Glitter. Pastels from the Musée d'Orsay\\" at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. In 2011, he was awarded the 3rd Prix Piero Crommelynck. In December 2019, Sothebys sold Szafran's Imprimerie Bellini for €876,000 from the Louis-Dreyfus Family Collection.

The aim of the company was to build a new large UK retail bank primarily through the acquisition of other banks. the company had failed to acquire any banking assets and had considered winding up as it had been unable to acquire any it had been interested in. However, after new investment from W.L. Ross in 2012 it continued to operate and in May 2014 said that it was still looking for potential acquisitions. By 2016 NBNK had still failed to acquire any target companies, and in June 2016 it entered voluntary liquidation.  History  = Foundation = The company was formed by Lord Levene and a consortium of City executives as a vehicle to acquire UK banking assets in domestic banking and eventually wealth management. On 2 July 2010 the company was incorporated under the name of De Facto 9999 plc, and a month later on 2 August the company name was changed to NBNK Investments plc. The company name, NBNK, is a portmanteau of \\"New Bank\\" (NewBaNK), and the company website primarily used the colour purple. The company was listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange on 20 August and has major advisers and investors on-board including Aviva, Invesco and F&C; Asset Management. People involved in the consortium include Peter Levene, chairman of Lloyd's of London, Sir David Walker who has been chairman of Morgan Stanley, Charles McCreevy former European Union internal markets commissioner and politician John McFall. = Attempts to purchase assets = In July 2010 it was reported that the nationalised British bank Northern Rock was a prime target for NBNK Investments. UK Financial Investments Limited, owners of Northern Rock, had been briefed on the proposals. On 4 November Gary Hoffman left Northern Rock to become CEO at NBNK Investments on 1 May 2011. Due to Hoffman's previous position NBNK Investments could not table a bid for Northern Rock for a period of 12 months. In November 2011 it was announced that Virgin Money would be buying Northern Rock. In September 2011 NBNK announced that trading in its shares would be suspended until takeover talks with an unnamed bank had been concluded. In November 2011 it was revealed that NBNK and the Co-operative Banking Group were the final two bidders for 600 or more of the branches of Lloyds Banking Group. In December 2011, Lloyds said its preferred option for the sale of 632 bank branches was to sell them to the Co-operative Group. That deal between Lloyds and the Co-operative fell through itself and the branches went on to form TSB Bank. = 2012 – 2016= NBNK announced on 27 June 2012 that the company would be wound down, as a result of the continuing talks between Lloyds Banking Group and the Co-operative Banking Group and the failure of the company to acquire a bank. At the time of the company winding down it had made three attempts to acquire banking assets, and they concluded that there were no other UK assets for sale that would have met the company's objectives. The company expects to return approximately 40% of the shareholders initial capital. On 28 June the company was restored to trading on AIM. In July and August 2012 Lord McFall of Alcluith resigned from his post as a Non-Executive Director and Sir David Walker resigned as Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director respectively; Walker became Chairman of Barclays. However, in late 2012 the company's direction changed again after W.L. Ross & Co Group made an offer to inject new capital into NBNK, take a stake in the company and maintain NBNK as an AIM listed company. W.L. Ross own a stake in Virgin Money, the company that bought Northern Rock which had been a target of NBNK. On 8 January 2013 shareholders agreed to Wilbur Ross' company. At that time 3 members of the board stood down and Wilbur Ross was appointed Chairman of NBNK. Lord Dan Brennan remains as a director. Due to his commitments with the Bank of Cyprus Wilbur Ross resigned as Chairman of NBNK in late 2014 and was replaced as chairman by Stephen Johnson. The policy was to maintain the Company at minimal cost while appropriate opportunities to make an acquisition in the financial services sector were sought. In the event, no such opportunities arose. In June 2016 following an AGM, a decision was made to return funds to the shareholders and the company entered voluntary liquidation.

From their first gig The Bollweevils received favourable reviews.\\"This is what electricity tastes like\\" - Paul Lester, Melody Maker, 30 June 1988 However, it was not until late in 1989 that the band signed a recording contract with the independent record label, Vinyl Solution. In March 1990, their first single was released on the Decoy label, the self produced and critically well-receivedMick Mercer, Melody Maker, 17 March 1990 (\\"...perfumed music with grizzled undertones\\") \\\\- Cathi Unsworth, Sounds, 14 April 1990 (\\"The juxtaposition of perfect pop voice with gleeful rawk bliss out is a finely balanced one...black bullets in a sherbet bag\\") \\\\- Steve Lamacq, NME, 5 May 1990 (\\"Talk To Me EP is a brittle, engaging piece of fizzing pop edged with some attractively poignant vocals\\") four track Talk To Me EP. ABC's Stephen Singleton agreed to help record the second single, but it was not finished until 1991 and neither the band nor the record company were happy with the results. The tracks were re-mixed in June with the punk/dance producer Alan Scott, but the Life's A Scream EP was never released in that form. In August 1991, the band added a second guitarist, Mark Shaw formerly of Circus Circus Circus, and Pete Darnborough (from Leeds techno- goths MDMA) took over on drums. Another EP was recorded in September with Jim Beattie (ex-Primal Scream) as producer. \\"Mouth\\" was released in November. At the beginning of 1992 a final song, \\"Missing Out\\", was recorded for Vinyl Solution, but once again it was a single that was never released. A Bollweevils compilation CD, Life's A Scream, was released in Japan in 1992, on the Toy's Factory label. It contained all the tracks from the first three recorded EPs. The Bollweevils disbanded in 1993. Post break-up *Johnson and Griffiths went on to form Bolster. Johnson now performs as/with Don't Sleep Dream.

It is native to Tropical Africa. Its English language common names include African nutmeg, false nutmeg, boxboard, and cardboard.Pycnanthus angolensis. AgroForestryTree Database. World Agroforestry Centre. In Africa it is widely known as ilomba.Richter, H. G. and M. J. Dallwitz. 2000 onwards. Pycnanthus angolensis. Commercial timbers: descriptions, illustrations, identification, and information retrieval. DELTA – DEscription Language for TAxonomy. June, 2009. Description This evergreen tree grows up to 40 meters tall and usually up to a meter wide, sometimes up to 1.5 meters or more. The trunk is straight and cylindrical with fissures and flaking bark. The sap is honey-colored and turns red in time. The branches are in whorls. The leathery leaves are up to 31 centimeters long by 9 wide. The blades have pointed tips, heart-shaped bases, and thick midribs. They are hairless on top and coated with rusty, feltlike hairs on the undersides. The leaves usually bear signs of insect damage, a feature so common it is considered characteristic of the species. The flowers are arranged in dense, rusty panicles up to 15 centimeters long. The individual flowers are difficult to see in the tight panicle until the stamens develop, being only about a millimeter long. The flowers are hairy and fragrant.Pycnanthus angolensis (Welw.) Warb. In: Stannard, B. L. Flora Zambesiaca Vol. 9, Part 2: Myristicaceae. 1997. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The fruit is a rounded drupe reaching over 3 centimeters long and wide, borne in clusters. It is hairy brown when new, turning yellow-orange, and has cartilaginous flesh that dries woody. It contains a black seed with a red aril which resembles that of nutmeg.Pycnanthus angolensis. PROTA. The fruit ripens over a long period continuing into the next flowering season, which begins around October. Ecology The tree grows in moist rainforests up to about 1200 meters in elevation among other evergreens and semideciduous trees. It occurs in secondary forest, sometimes taking hold in new canopy gaps or clearings. It thrives in sunny locations. It grows in riparian forests such as gallery forests, and in some regions it can be found in swamps. It occurs in areas receiving between about 1300 and 1800 millimeters of rain per year, but the optimal seems to be about 2000 millimeters. Many animals feed on the fruits, such as hornbills.Pycnanthus angolensis. An Introduction to the Trees from the North of the Republic of Congo. Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. Uses This species has a wide variety of human uses. It is harvested for its wood, which is light, soft, and whitish gray or pink-tinged in color. Its popularity rose after World War II when plywood was in demand, and during the mid-20th century it was one of the more valuable timbers in Central Africa. It is not very durable and tends to warp, but it is easy to cut and work and can be used for many purposes. It is suitable for furniture, and in house construction as panelling, siding, roof shingles, and framing. It is used for fuel and paper pulp. The wood can be vulnerable to termites, powderpost beetles, and other pests. The yellowish or reddish fat from the aromatic seed is called \\"kombo butter\\" or \\"Angola tallow\\". A seed can be up to 70% fat. It is used as a fuel for lighting and is made into soap. Seed remnants are used in compost. When ignited, the oily seed burns slowly and can be used as a candle. In Uganda the tree is grown in banana, coffee, and cocoa plantations to shade the crops. Most parts of the tree have been used in traditional African medicine. The sap has been used to control bleeding. The bark has been used as a poison antidote and a treatment for leprosy, anemia, infertility, gonorrhea, and malaria. Leaf extracts are consumed or used in an enema to treat edema. Root extracts are used to treat parasitic infections, such as schistosomiasis. The seed oil is used to treat thrush. Like the fat of nutmeg, kombo butter is mostly myristic acid, with a high amount of myristoleic acid, as well. It contains the unique compound kombic acid, which was named for the tree under its nomenclatural synonym, P. kombo. Cultivation This tree is cultivated for its products. Seeds are sown in the field, and seedlings are grown in plant nurseries until they have large taproots. They cannot tolerate drought. After a year the tree is about half a meter tall, and within 4 years it can reach 4 meters. A 20-year-old tree can be 25 meters tall. Stands of cultivated trees are pruned and thinned periodically. Pest insects such as Monochamus scabiosus and Mallodon downesi and fungi such as Ophiostoma sp. have been observed, but they are not severe problems. The freshly harvested wood may become discolored due to bacterial growth, the light-colored wood developing dark brown staining. Trees can be cut when they reach a diameter of 50 centimeters, at around 30 years old. Agricultural cooperatives in Ghana cultivate the trees for the kombo butter. Common names There are common names for the plant in many languages. It is called mkungu mwitu in Swahili, akwa-mili and oje in Igbo, lunaba and munaba in Luganda, akomu in Yoruba, calabo in Spanish, and arbre à suif and faux muscadier in French.

They were created in order that the whole group of grants or gifts could be confirmed by the ruler.Van Houts \\"Historical Writing\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 117 They are known from Normandy and other northern French regions. Sometimes they were created over a number of years as successive gifts were added to the original document. Generally the various grants were tied together with a narrative, usually quite short, that linked the various gifts to a short history of the religious house.Chibnall \\"Charter and Chronicle\\" Church and Government p. 11 These documents were a frequent product of monastic houses in Normandy during the early 11th century and afterwards. Normally, they were not a product of the lay administration's chanceries, but came from ecclesiastical sources. The historian David Bates has argued that the term pancartes has been overused in historical studies, pointing out that the strict definition of the term is \\"a charter which reproduces the text of more than one charter\\". The important point to Bates is that the document duplicates the original diplomatic of the copied charter.Bates \\"Introduction\\" Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum p. 22 Sometimes the pancarte was recopied after a number of additions had been made to the original, and this could occasionally lead to errors in chronology, as the additions to the original might have been made without respect to the actual order of the donations. The historian Marjorie Chibnall states that the medieval historian Orderic Vitalis used now lost pancartes of various Norman monastic houses as sources for his historical writings.Chibnall \\"Charter and Chronicle\\" Church and Government pp. 12–13 The surviving pancartes are important not only for their recording of now-lost charters, but also for understanding the history of historical writing. The practice of writing pancartes influenced English monasteries, which were in contact with Norman houses after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Post-Conquest cartularies, such as Hemming's Cartulary, bear many similarities to the Norman pancartes. Later, in the reign of King Henry II of England, the monastic writers Benedict of Peterborough, Roger of Howden, and Ralph Diceto also built on the pancarte when they inserted documents into their narratives, although their connecting stories were much more elaborate than many other pancartes.Van Houts \\"Historical Writing\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 120 Citations References  Category:Medieval legal texts Category:Anglo-Norman literature ","title":"Pancartes"},{"id":"29473177","text":"The U.S. Courthouse and Post Office in Aberdeen, Mississippi was built in 1885.

Starting in the 1990s, it targets traffickers transporting illicit drugs through the air by forcing down suspicious aircraft, using lethal force if necessary. The program was suspended in April 2001 when a legitimate civilian aircraft was shot down in Peru and two U.S. citizens were killed. It was restarted in Colombia in August 2003 after additional safeguards were established. As of 2005, the United States had provided $68 million for the program, which had so far produced only one drug seizure. In 2010 the Government Accountability Office produced a report stating that the program faced challenges and that the effectiveness of the program at stopping narcotics trafficking was difficult to assess. It noted, however, that the program often advanced broad foreign policy objectives of the United States.  Mistaken shootdown of US civilians  In 2001, a small floatplane carrying a family of four missionaries and a pilot was tracked by a CIA spotter plane as a possible drug-running plane. The Peruvian Air Force wrongly identified it as belonging to a drug smuggler, and a Peruvian fighter aircraft shot it down. Of the five people on the plane, Veronica Bowers and her infant daughter were killed in the incident, while her husband Jim and their son Cory, as well as the pilot Kevin Donaldson, managed to survive after crash-landing the plane on the Amazon River despite serious leg wounds. On November 1, 2010 the Central Intelligence Agency declassified a 2008 CIA inspector general report that indicated that retired and current officers were given administrative punishments for their role in the incident. While the report laid the blame for the shoot-down at the feet of the Peruvian military, investigators concluded \\"there were problems with the program\\" and mistakes were made, requiring disciplinary action.

The unit would score 123 confirmed aerial victories during the war, including 11 enemy observation balloons. In turn, they would suffer 13 killed in action, 15 wounded in action, two injured in flying accidents, and two taken prisoner of war. Operational history A lineup of Albatros D.III fighters. Jasta 36 began with D.IIIs. Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 36 was founded on 11 January 1917; however, it did not organize until 21 February. It began at FEA 13, Breslau, with its first commanding officer, Albert Dossenbach, assigned the following day. The new squadron began its operational history supporting 1 Armee from Le Châtelet. Le Chatelet took two weeks hectic construction to equip it as an airfield. It scored its first victory on 5 April 1917; coincidentally, it was Dossenbach's tenth. Spurred by his example, Jasta 36 pilots began to score; by April's end, the unit's victories totaled 13 French aircraft. Heinrich Bongartz added to that two observation balloons set aflame, for a grand total of 15 victories. However, on 2 May the jasta would lose its commander, when Dossenbach was wounded in a retaliatory bombing raid by the French. On 18 or 19 June 1917, Jasta 36 changed to support 4 Armee from Sailly. Six days later, it moved to Markebeke to oppose the British Royal Flying Corps. The squadron flew against the British during latter 1917. On 27 November, the unit's war diary reported the squadron's 77th victory. By year's end, the number had risen to 87. During January 1918, the jasta received a number of new Fokker Dr.I triplanes. On 14 February 1918, Jasta 36 joined Jasta 2, Jasta 26, and Jasta 27 in Jagdgeschwader III (JG III); the newly created fighter wing was commanded by Bruno Loerzer. In March 1918, when it moved to Erchin, it supported 17 Armee. On 14 April, it returned to control of 4 Armee. On 23 May 1918, it began supporting 7 Armee from Vivaise. On 25 August 1918, it took up its final role of the war, supporting 17 Armee again from Emerchicourt. Although it would change bases another half dozen times, it ended the war in this role.

It was intended to demonstrate the latest technologies to operating agencies and the riding public, and serve to promote existing and proposed transit lines. A single married pair was produced by the St. Louis Car Company in 1972. It operated in intermittent revenue service on six rapid transit systems in five United States cities between May 1974 and January 1977. Since 1989, the two cars have been on display at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine. Design and development \\"Lo-Density\\" seating in a demonstrator car Around 1970, the United States Department of Transportation's Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) began the Urban Rapid Rail Vehicle and Systems Program with the intention of creating a new rapid transit vehicle for use on existing and proposed systems. The new cars were to represent the state of the art in transit vehicle technology; priority was placed on making them comfortable, safe, reliable, and quiet to attract passengers. Boeing Vertol was selected in 1971 to manage the State-of-the-Art Car (SOAC) project. SOAC carrying passengers, including United States Secretary of Transportation John Volpe, on its first trip after dedication ceremony in 1972 The Budd Company, Pullman-Standard, Rohr Industries, the St. Louis Car Company, and Vought bid for a contract to produce a two-car demonstrator set, which was won by the St. Louis Car Company. The design was based on the R44 subway car, which the company had recently produced for the New York City Subway, with influences from recently produced BART rolling stock. The two SOAC demonstrator cars were completed in 1972; along with the R44, they were the last rolling stock produced by the company. The SOAC cars cost $350,000 each, compared to $300,000 each for the R44. The SOAC was built to meet the loading gauge of existing rapid transit systems in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, and Philadelphia. It was restricted to certain lines, including the IND Division in New York City and the Skokie Swift in Chicago because other parts of those systems had smaller loading gauges. The SOAC was built to dimensions nearly identical to the R44: long and wide. Floor height could be adjusted to match platform heights of each system, with the cars to high depending on configuration. The two demonstrator cars were built with two different configurations: \\"Lo-Density\\" with a total capacity of 220 passengers per car, and \\"Hi-Density\\" with 300-passenger capacity. The \\"Hi-Density\\" car had a mixture of transverse and longitudinal seating, with a total of 72 seats. The \\"Lo-Density\\" car had 62 seats in three sections: one with only transverse seats, one with a mix of seat types, and one with a mix of seat types and two tables. Both demonstrator cars were \\"A\\" cars with a cab at one end. The SOAC used third rail power in most locations, but power was collected from overhead lines in Chicago and Cleveland. Testing A publicity postcard of the SOAC The SOAC was first tested at the High Speed Ground Test Center in Pueblo, Colorado. On August 11, 1973, the test train collided with a freight car due to a mis-set switch, killing the operator. The collision focused additional attention on the safety of the SOAC design. After the initial testing, the SOAC set toured six rapid transit systems in five United States cities for additional testing and public rides. (The other two operating systems were excluded: then-newly opened BART used broad gauge tracks, while PATH had a small loading gauge that allowed only -long, -wide cars.) Revenue service began on the New York City Subway on May 17, 1974; the SOAC ran on the A, D, E, and N services until July 19. It was then operated in revenue service on the MBTA Red Line in Boston for a month beginning on August 19, 1974. The SOAC demonstrator was then tested on the CTS Airport Line later in 1974, with fifteen days of revenue service. The SOAC next operated on the CTA Skokie Swift line for thirteen days of revenue service in January 1975. The cars were slightly wider and substantially longer than other CTA rolling stock; the platforms at the two Skokie Swift stations were modified with retractable edges. The next stop was Philadelphia, where the SOAC operated on revenue service on the SEPTA Broad Street Line from March 6 to April 2, 1975. Over this initial testing program, the SOAC operated over 104 days, carrying an estimated 312,000 passengers. After the completion of the original testing program, the SOAC was transferred to the PATCO Speedline for additional service, with non-revenue tests taking place on May 1, 1975. After vehicle modifications and insurance negotiations, a planned nine months of revenue service began on August 12, 1976. By the time operations ceased on January 24, 1977, the cars had only operated in revenue service for 23 days. The SOAC was well received by the public, particularly due to the quiet operation and air conditioning, as well as by the train operators, who found it easy to control. The operating agencies had more mixed reactions; only some found it useful. After the SOAC and the mixed results of the US Standard Light Rail Vehicle program, UMTA did not pursue further vehicle designs, but instead focused on subsystem research. A number of design elements from the SOAC – including acoustic design, air-ride suspension, chopper propulsion controls, and traction motor ventilation – were incorporated on future rolling stock designs by numerous agencies. The SOAC cars were stored at Boeing Vertol until May 1979, when one was shipped to the Budd Company and one to Pueblo, where they were used for additional subsystem testing. The two-car demonstrator was acquired by the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine as a static display in 1989 and has remained there since.

Dogs of this type were usually bred and trained to trot alongside carriages to protect the occupants from banditry or other interference. They were usually owned and used by the wealthy or traders and merchants. The dogs were trained to attack the horses used by highwaymen, giving the owners' human security time to respond to the actual robbers. When the Dalmatian breed was introduced to England in the 18th century, they quickly became the carriage- dog breed of choice. Because of this, \\"carriage dog\\" became synonymous with \\"Dalmatian\\". The British Carriage Dog Society exists to preserve \\"the working heritage of the Dalmatian as a coaching dog.\\" Previously any breed with long legs and some weight in the body had been used. The number of dogs accompanying any coach could be an indicator of the occupants' wealth or status: some well-situated people would run six or eight dogs. Coach dogs were kennelled in the stables, and bonded with the horses as pups. They were trained to regard strange horses on the road as hostile, and it was up to the human security to ensure other riders were warned to stay clear of the coach on the road. A more civic usage was as fire-engine escorts, helping to clear the way in crowded streets as well as guarding the very expensive horses in their stables. With the demise of horse-drawn transport, the need for the dogs declined, and they became largely ceremonial assets, but were often repurposed as static house and barn guard dogs. Today carriage dogs are valued as loyal pets and companions.

The Bellows Falls Tunnel is a railroad tunnel located in center of the Village of Bellows Falls within the Town of Rockingham, Vermont, adjacent to the Connecticut River, and is currently owned and operated by the New England Central Railroad (NECR). The Vermont Valley Railroad originally constructed the tunnel in 1851. Partially cut through solid rock, the tunnel was built with rough-cut stone blocks, where each portal was decorated with radiating voussoirs around their horseshoe shaped arches. The stone blocks average about 18 inches deep as observed at the tunnel portals. Record information available from the NECR would indicate that a separate support system exists above the masonry tunnel supporting the hotel building to the north of the Bridge Street roadwayNew England Central Railroad ~ Double Stack Clearance Study ~ Work Order #11, Appendix: Section 9, Vermont Agency of Transportation, Rail & Aviation Division, January 1999 which is also directly above, and crosses perpendicular (east/west) to the tunnel below. The tunnel runs in a north/south direction and is located at Milepost 144.56 of the NECR connecting the Canadian National (CN) line in Canada to CSX and other rail lines in Massachusetts. Tunnel Dimensions The tunnel is 278 feet long, extending from the north side of Mill Street to within 157 feet of the Bellows Falls Canal Bridge. As of August 2007 the vertical clearance of the tunnel was (20 ft. 8 in.). There is a slight down grade from south to north. There is a curve to the west (looking south), just south of the tunnel and its grade crossing. The track is tangent from the grade crossing through the tunnel and over the half-thru girder bridge. To the northwest of the tunnel, there is a crib wall. Drainage in the area is generally poor, with a few inches of standing water at the south end of the tunnel during wet weather. Prior to 2007, according to the Clearance Measurement Vehicle (CMV) clearance plate, the crest of the tunnel arch was (20 ft. 6 in.) above the top of rail. However, the minimum vertical clearance, due to the arch curvature was really (18 ft. 2 in.) at (4 ft. 9 in.) from the centerline of track which is (9 ft. 6 in.) wide.  Tunnel Modifications  Interior view of tunnel excavation lowering the trackage, 2007. Over its lifespan, the tunnel floor had been lowered three times; once in 1897, again in 1977 (by the Boston & Maine Railroad), and most recently in 2007 (as a joint venture between the Vermont Agency of Transportation, FHWA, and NECR with consultants; Parson Brinckerhoff Engineering & ECI Rail Constructors, Inc.) in order to accommodate increased car and locomotive heights at their respective periods of time. The 1977 clearance improvement project lowered the tracks through the tunnel and created a new vertical profile from north of the bridge over the canal to the south of the existing tunnel. The 1977 vertical profile required the modification of the floor system for the half thru girder bridge over the canal. Negotiations with the Green Mountain Power Company at the time of the lowering resulted in an agreement to set the bridge on a modified grade over the canal that improved the vertical profile through the tunnel without reducing the bridge structure's clearance above the canal's high water elevation. The trackage was lowered in the tunnel approximately two feet by underpinning the existing tunnel walls. This project resulted in a track profile through the tunnel that was the lowest resulting profile achievable given the physical constraints of the area and is considered to be substandard for the railroad industry. Until the 2007 project, the tunnel had been a choke point for the movement of modern autoracks and double stack containers into and out of Vermont. The 2007 project lowered the trackage to accommodate \\"Modified double stack containers\\" through the tunnel, utilizing a modified design build management process to expedite the tunnel work in an efficient, cost effective, and timely manner. On Saturday, August 18 at 4:00 a.m., rail traffic on the eastern side of Vermont was shut down for three days so that the lowering of the track could occur. Crews worked 24 hours each day until the work was completed. A test train ran over the track on Monday August 20. Approximately 750 cubic yards of material was excavated from within the tunnel. Trackage was dropped about 3 feet while the lower tunnel foundation was installed with steel walls and struts in order to enable future track lowering (for full double stack clearance) without necessity of additional foundation underpinning (after the railroad adjusts the elevation of their Canal Bridge).

It is the sequel to Darksiders and was released in August 2012 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and as a launch title for Wii U upon the console's Australian, European, and North American release in November 2012. The story follows the efforts of player character Death to clear the name of his brother, War, who stands accused of wiping out humanity. A remastered version, titled Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition, was published by Nordic Games for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in 2015, and ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2019. A parallel sequel, Darksiders III, was released on November 27, 2018. Gameplay Players take control of Death, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The core gameplay is an action role-playing hack and slash style. The game makes frequent use of interactive puzzle elements, requiring the player to think their way through a series of levers, doors, elevators, portals, etc. in order to traverse areas and reach objectives. Maps are vast and each contain open world regions that can be explored freely on foot or by horse, along with numerous dungeons where quest objectives are generally carried out. There are main and side quests, with main and side boss fights. Worlds can be traversed via fast travel, whereby the player can teleport to certain map points instantly. While inside a dungeon, the player is allowed to fast travel back to the overworld while saving their dungeon location for continuation later without losing progress. Death is aided by Despair, a horse that is available for use in open areas of the overworld for faster travel, and Dust, a raven that guides him to his objectives. Death's primary weapons are two scythes, one wielded in each hand. Secondary weapons include melee weapons like hammers, axes, and maces as \\"slow\\" options; \\"fast\\" options are generally gauntlet-style weapons that provide the player with claws and other bladed arm extensions, at the expense of less range and power than the slow weapons. There are several different movement options, including swimming, running along walls, and climbing options that are available on specially placed wooden elements, such as wall pegs and beams. In the course of quests, Death acquires \\"Death Grip\\", which operates as a grappling hook on certain objects; and \\"Voidwalker\\". Other abilities like \\"Soul Splitter\\" and \\"Interdiction\\" are acquired, which allow the player to control multiple characters to traverse puzzle areas. Health, Wrath, and Reaper resource meters display on-screen whenever they change, along with an experience meter that shows how close the player is to the next character class level. Wrath is the game's mana-type system, being a resource used for special abilities. Reaper is a separate resource used for the Reaper ability, and when full, Death can transform briefly into his grim reaper form, which is more resilient and deals more damage. There are eight player statistics, including a character class level that increases at various experience levels. Each new level gives the player a skill point that can be used in a skill tree that contains new abilities. Other statistics can be increased by equipping items, with each item having various stat-altering characteristics. The player's inventory contains seven different pages of equipment classes (primary and secondary weapon, shoulder, armor, glove, boot, and talisman, with an additional page for quest items). New equipment can be acquired via enemy drops, looting chests, or purchasing from vendor characters. New combo moves can also be purchased from \\"Trainer\\" characters. \\"Stonebites\\", which are colored stones hidden throughout the world, can be collected (after several quests have been completed) and traded to a character named Blackroot, in groups of three, in exchange for various permanent statistic upgrades. There are three Stonebite types, indicated by their color, and the particular combination traded determines which upgrade is received. Money is dropped by enemies and chests, and can be acquired by selling items to vendors. Special \\"Possessed weapons\\" are rarely acquired, which provide another more unorthodox mechanic for trading in unwanted items, whereby the possessed weapon can be upgraded by \\"sacrificing\\" other lesser items to it. Plot Darksiders II is parallel to the previous game. The Four Horsemen - War, Strife, Fury, and Death, the player character - are the last of the Nephilim, cursed fusions of angels and demons who waged war on all of Creation. To preserve the balance of the Universe, the Four, tired of conquest, received incredible powers from the Charred Council in exchange for slaughtering their kin. Death personally cut down the last of their brethren, Absalom, the first Nephilim; this earned him the title of Kinslayer, among others. However, he secretly preserved the souls of the Nephilim in an amulet, defying the Council, and gave the amulet to the Keeper of Secrets, also known as the Crowfather, for safekeeping. While War is charged with his crimes, Death, sure of his brother's innocence, sets out on a personal mission to erase his brother's 'crime' and resurrect humanity. He first travels to the Icy Veil, a dimension between the three kingdoms of Heaven, Hell, and Earth, to seek the Crowfather for proof of War's innocence and the way to restore Earth. The Crowfather tells Death that he must go to the Tree of Life in order to restore humanity, and demands that Death take back the amulet. When Death refuses, the Crowfather attacks him in the shape of War. Death is thus forced to kill the Crowfather, but the amulet shatters and the fragments embed themselves in his chest, knocking him out and sending him into a portal created by the Crowfather's death. Death wakes up in the Forge Lands, a world populated by the Makers, physically imposing beings who are the Architects of Creation. He learns that their world, and many others, has been overrun with Corruption, a dark force that has blocked off the Tree of Life and has taken over many of the Maker's constructs. The Makers had crafted a massive Guardian to combat the Corruption, but had to abandon it before finishing the task due to the surrounding threats. With the help of constructs and a Maker named Karn, Death eventually reaches the Guardian. However, upon activation, the Guardian is tainted by Corruption and goes on a rampage. Death battles the Guardian and destroys it, allowing it to be reassembled free of Corruption. The Guardian self-destructs in the grasp of the creature blocking the path to the Tree of Life, which allows Death to reach his goal. Upon reaching the entrance, however, Death is seized by Corruption and dragged into the Tree. There, Death is accosted by the shadowy form of Absalom, whose hatred lasted beyond his slaying at Death's hands and birthed the Corruption, enabling him to take his revenge on Creation. Death is transported to the Kingdom of the Dead, where he encounters the merchant Ostegoth. From Ostegoth, he learns that he must find the Well of Souls in order to bring back Mankind, and to that end he must speak with the Lord of Bones. After completing an array of trials to gain an audience with the Lord of Bones, Death is transported to the City of the Dead to find a soul capable of telling Death what he needs to know about the Well. After facing off against a creature housing all of mankind's souls, Death meets the soul the Lord of Bones alluded to: the Crowfather's. The Crowfather tells Death that the souls of humanity are no longer bound in a host, but have been transported to the Well. Death learns that the Well of Souls has power over life and death, and that with it, the spirits of all things living are cleansed and renewed before they are sent out to be reborn. In order to access it, Death would need two keys: one kept by the angels, the other by the demons. Death asks why he and the other riders never knew of such things, to which the Crowfather replies that power must be tempered with ignorance; the Council feared that if the Horsemen ever learned the truth about the Well's power, they might try to resurrect their kin. Death first seeks the key held by the angels and is sent to an outpost of Heaven called Lostlight, which is under assault by Corruption. At the Ivory Tower, he meets the Archon, who tells Death that his answers are in the Ivory Citadel, which has been claimed by Corruption. The Archon sends Death to Earth to bring back the Rod of Arafel, a powerful holy weapon, so that the way to the Ivory Citadel could be cleared. On Earth, Death encounters remnants of the Hellguard being led by Uriel. With their help, Death reassembles the shattered rod. After traveling to the Ivory Citadel and confronting its custodian, Jamaerah the Scribe, Death realizes that the Archon has possessed the key the entire time and that he has fallen to Corruption himself. Returning to Lostlight, Death confronts the Archon, kills him, and acquires the first key. Death then proceeds to Shadow's Edge, described as a dark reflection of Lostlight. Upon arrival, he sees that the world itself is in the process of being devoured by Corruption. Intent on acquiring the second key, Death travels to the fortress home of the demon lord, Samael, but finds Lilith, a female demon-queen who created the Nephilim; thus she refers to herself as Death's mother, which he angrily denies. Death learns from Lilith that Samael is gone, but that he will be able to meet with the demon lord by utilizing a time portal. Before he leaves, Lilith urges Death to \\"follow [his] heart\\" and revive the Nephilim when he finds the Well of Souls. After traversing through the fortress in both the past and present, Death finally meets Samael, who is not willing to just hand over the Key. After testing Death in a fierce battle, Samael gives Death the demon key, saying that it should prove to be an interesting show no matter what. With both keys in hand, Death returns to the Tree of Life and has a penultimate meeting with the Crowfather, who reminds him that the fate of two races, humanity and the Nephilim, are at stake, and warns that Corruption has chosen a named champion to block Death's efforts. Death enters using the keys and proceeds into the Well of Souls, where he is met by Absalom. Absalom taunts Death by saying that Corruption does not harm Death because he is already \\"blackened by the sin of betrayal.\\" Absalom and Death battle, and Death defeats Absalom just as he did eons ago. The Crowfather appears one last time and explains that Death may tap the Well's power to restore one race, but a sacrifice is needed. Warned that choosing one race will forever doom the other, Death chooses to save War and sacrifices the souls of the Nephilim, still trapped in the scar on his chest, as well as his own, for humanity by leaping into the Well. An epilogue retells the final moments from the first game, with Uriel questioning if War intends to wage his campaign against the Charred Council alone, to which War replies \\"No, not alone.\\" The scene then shows the arrival of the other Horsemen. The narrator states that \\"the number of the riders shall ever be four,\\" and the Horsemen appear: War, Strife, Fury and, finally, Death. In a post-credit scene, Lilith is seen being berated by a being who is completely in shadow (referred to by Lilith as 'my Prince', strongly suggesting Lucifer), angered that humanity has been restored and the Nephilim are lost forever. Lilith says she awaits punishment with a slight smile, but the entity states that \\"[she] will get no pleasure from it this time\\". The screen fades as Lilith screams in agony. Development and release THQ's creative director Luis Gigliotti revealed in an interview with GameAxis that Darksiders would be a franchise and that they were contemplating a sequel. Joystiq stated that a Darksiders sequel was planned for the fiscal year of 2012. An article on the Official Xbox Magazine website confirmed that Darksiders II was expected to be released in 2012. It was announced at E3 2011 that Darksiders II would be a launch title for the then-upcoming Wii U with modifications necessary to fit the controls of the Nintendo console as well as some new features unique to the console. The game takes Death across multiple dungeons and city hubs. City hubs feature NPCs who can give out side quests etc. One city hub connects to a number of dungeons and one city area features more dungeons than the whole of the original Darksiders. Loot is also included, dropping from encounters as rewards ranging from 12 different armor piece categories, which can have different enchantments and may power up Death's Wrath Powers. At the San Diego Comic Con, it was revealed that Michael Wincott would provide the voice of Death. On June 19, 2012, James Cosmo (who appeared as a priest in \\"The Last Sermon,\\" a live-action trailer for the game) was announced as the voice of Maker Elder Eideard, Death's guide throughout the story. On February 14, THQ has announced that Darksiders II would hit stores on June 26, 2012. Pre-order DLC bonuses for the game were also announced, for GameStop, Best Buy and Amazon. On April 18, 2012, THQ announced on their website that Darksiders II was to be delayed until August 2012. The PC requirements were released on July 19, 2012. In Japan, the game was published and localized by Spike Chunsoft. A remastered port of Darksiders II known as the Deathinitive Edition was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2015. It was published by Nordic Games, which had acquired the rights to the Darksiders franchise following the bankruptcy of THQ. The port was developed by Gunfire Games, a studio that was founded by Darksiders creator David Adams following the closure of Crytek USA (which itself was established after the closure of Vigil by THQ) and consists almost entirely of Vigil staff. Along with higher-resolution graphics and a revamped lighting engine, the studio also made changes to adjust the balance of the game. The Xbox One version of the edition was announced on June 11, 2015. A port of the Deathinitive Edition to the Nintendo Switch was announced on August 5, 2019. =Downloadable content= A season pass is available and includes The Abyssal Forge (a story-driven installment taking place in the Shadow Lands), The Demon Lord Belial (another story-driven installment taking place on Earth) and The Maker Armor and Scythe Set. Argul's Tomb is another story-driven pack not included in the season pass. The Angel of Death Pack includes new enhanced weapons and armor along with a new visual effect for Dust. The Deadly Despair pack offers a speed boost to Death's horse Despair. Various other DLC packs have been released offering weapons and armor much like the Angel of Death pack. The Deathinitive Edition of the game, released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, include these story expansions as well as extra equipment. Reception Darksiders II received positive reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Wii U version 85/100, the PlayStation 3 version 84/100, the Xbox 360 version 83/100, and the PC version 81/100. IGN gave it a score of 7.5, saying \\"Despite its problems, I was compelled onward in my quest with Death because Darksiders II is simply a fun game\\". The game was the best selling game in August of 2012 with over 247,000 units sold in the United States. As of November 5, 2012, the game had only sold 1.5 million copies, with THQ stating that the game \\"did not perform to our expectations.\\" Sequel A third Darksiders game was originally planned by Vigil Games, however, the fate of its franchise was threatened due to financial complications. Its parent company, THQ, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The company's assets were sold at an auction, excluding Vigil Games, which was shut down along with the parent company THQ. In April 2013, THQ began a process to auction off the remaining IP that it had not yet sold, including Darksiders. Several companies publicly expressed interest in bidding for the franchise, including the Japanese developer PlatinumGames, and Crytek USA, a Crytek subsidiary led by former Vigil CEO David Adams, and primarily staffed by former Vigil employees. Adams had expressed interest in allowing Darksiders to come back \\"home\\" to its creators. On April 22, 2013, Darksiders, along with Red Faction and MX vs. ATV, was purchased by Nordic Games in the final transaction of THQ's assets. On June 14, 2013, Nordic Games has stated in an interview with Joystiq that fans \\"[should] not look for a Darksiders 3 before two years from now\\". On May 2, 2017, after a product listing for Darksiders III appeared on Amazon.com, Darksiders III was officially revealed. The game was released on November 27, 2018.

He utilized propaganda in a wide range of media including theater, art, newspapers and bulletins to “promote the precise image he desired.”Hanley, The Genesis of Napoleonic Propaganda, 141. Napoleon’s bulletins from the battlefield were published in newspapers and were well read throughout the country.Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, 141. He used these publications to exaggerate his victories and spread his glorified interpretation of these successes throughout France.  Medallions  In addition to more standard methods of propaganda, such as the press, Napoleon capitalized on the popularity of medallions for his own purposes. Specifically, Napoleon used medallions as tools to promote his desired image both before and after he became Emperor. In the end, he commissioned more medals than Louis XV and Louis XVI combined.Hanley, The Genesis of Napoleonic Propaganda, 144. Of particular importance was Napoleon’s first set of medallions, the “Five Battles” Series, produced to commemorate his victories during the first Italian campaign. = Five Battles Series= The Millesimo-Dego medallion features Hercules holding a club and the Hydra of Lerna’s head. In the other hand Hercules is holding a torch of blazing fire, ready to slaughter this beast. Around the borders of the medals reads “Bataille De Millesimo Combat de Dego.”Laskey, A Description of the Series of Medals, 3. The Hercules figure on these coins represents victory but was also a symbol chosen by the French Republic to represent the nation, thereby connecting Napoleon to both triumph and France.Lynn Hunt, Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution,p. 94. The Po-Adda-Mincio medal depicts Napoleon Bonaparte leading his soldiers across the Adda on the bridge at Lodi.Hanley, The Genesis of Napoleonic Propaganda, 151. This medallion glorifies the battle in which most of Lombardy, an Italian province, was captured by the French army. Subsequently, Napoleon was named General-in-chief at Milan, the Lombard capital.Hanley, The Genesis of Napoleonic Propaganda, 152. The coin celebrates not only Napoleon’s victory but his ascension to greater power. The Battle of Castiglione and the combat at Peschiera medallion pays tribute to Napoleon’s victories in Italy. Napoleon faced an Austrian army in both locations and defeated them, strengthening the French Army’s position in the region.Hanley, The Genesis of Napoleonic Propaganda, 156 The coin displays three naked warriors, two locked in combat while the third lies slain on the ground. Of the two living figures, one, representing Napoleon’s army, stands ready to strike the final blow to the vanquished Austrians. In some versions Napoleon’s name is inscribed on the coin connecting Bonaparte to the victory and promoting his own personal image.Hanley, The Genesis of Napoleonic Propaganda, 155. The Capitulation of Mantua coin commemorates the capture of the Northern Italian city by Napoleon. The medal depicts a woman handing the keys of the city to a Roman warrior. On the reverse, ‘A L’Armée D’Italie Victorieuse’ is inscribed in addition to Napoleon’s name on some editions of the coin. Symbols from antiquity were used throughout the revolutionary period to tie the new French Republic to the glory of Ancient Rome. By using Roman soldiers on the medallions, Napoleon not only connects himself to the grandeur of ancient times, but also promotes his image as a victorious leader of Revolutionary France. The Tagliamento-Trieste medallion immortalizes Napoleon’s 1797 crossing of the Tagliomento River and the capture of Trieste. The medal shows a god-like figure reclining near a river while a charging army rushes a fleeing group of men. The attacking army is headed by a man on horseback, presumably Napoleon. Like the other medallions, one version has Napoleon’s name inscribed on the side.Hanley, The Genesis of Napoleonic Propaganda, 158. The medallion bolsters Napoleon’s image by directly connecting him to yet another victory.  References   Works Cited  Censer, Jack R. and Lynn Hunt (2001).

Family Beattie Casely-Hayford was the eldest son of Essie and Archibald Casely-Hayford, a lawyer, Gold Coast nationalist and former Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources in Ghana's First Republic.\\" The men who flanked Nkrumah on Independence eve\\" , National Commission on Culture, 14 April 2007. His brother was Louis Casely-Hayford, an engineer and former CEO of Volta River Authority in Ghana. Casely-Hayford's was a member of the prominent Casely-Hayford family, his grandparents were Beatrice Madelene (née Pinnock) and Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a Gold Coast lawyer, author, journalist, educator, politician and Pan-Africanist. Early years Casely- Hayford was born in Sekondi, Ghana, which was then the Gold Coast, and educated at Forrest Hill House School and Dulwich College, England. His education in England was interrupted when he returned to the Gold Coast at the onset of World War II. Casely-Hayford was self employed at this time. He extracted coconut oil to make soap and ran two garages which repaired and spray-painted cars. Career Casely-Hayford trained for a year in England as a Totalisator Technician for the Kumasi Race Course; and worked at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, then Kumasi Institute of Technology, as the Maintenance Officer. Later, he served as the Director and Operations Manager for Ghana Poultry Farm, Nungua; Director of the Arts Council of Ghana; Director of Ghana Broadcasting Corporation's Television division (GBC TV); Technical Director of Modern Signs; and then finally settled into private business. He owned and operated Caselyco Sound Studio, Signals and Controllers, Intek Engineering, and finally Televid Video and Audio. Ghana Arts Council Casely-Hayford's interests included art and science. Ghana's former Prime Minister Dr. Kwame Nkrumah asked Nana Kobina Nketsiah to have Casely-Hayford start up the Arts Council of Ghana after the British relinquished the then Roger Club, a social club for Accra's elite that was located on Accra's Atlantic coast. Beattie Casely-Hayford with Sylvia George and friend at a party in Accra Casely-Hayford became the first director of the Ghana Arts Council. He was responsible for bringing to the fore the early concert party groups and plays. He also had the British Council sponsor drama performances and movies of Shakespeare plays. He also collaborated with the artist and musician Saka Acquaye, who succeeded him as the director of the Ghana Arts Council. Saka Acquaye's plays were also featured at the Accra Arts Centre, including his most important and popular musical, The Lost Fishermen. The original Wulomei – a traditional folk music group that Saka Acquaye managed – was introduced to a national audience at the Accra Arts Centre. The master drummer, percussionist and musician Guy Warren (Kofi Ghanaba) was prominently featured on several weekends. The classical musician Victor Gbeho also had the National Orchestra rehearsing and performing at the Accra Arts Centre. Many foreign cultural exchange shows were also put on at the Accra Arts Centre. For instance, troupes from Russia and from China performed, the Chinese troupe singing a song in Twi, the local Ghanaian language. Louis Armstrong and other American performers Casely-Hayford was instrumental in the arrangements during the 1956 visit of Louis Armstrong, his wife Lucille, and band to Ghana.Penny Von Eschen, Satchmo Blows Up the World: Jazz Ambassadors Play the Cold War, Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 61. Casely- Hayford helped to arrange a durbar at Achimota School, where Louis and Lucille Armstrong and the band members were entertained by Ghanaian cultural dancers and musicians.Louis Armstrong's visit to Ghana. The US Information Service (\\"USIS\\") often sent performers to Ghana as part of a cultural relations program. The jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd performed in one of such shows and ended the show with one of Jimi Hendrix's songs, \\"Hey Joe\\". Cozy Cole was another such performer. Another American resident in Ghana, dentist Robert Lee, former Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) classmate of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, who had relocated with his family to Ghana from the US, taught voice and was also often on stage. Cultural shows and pop competitions The boys playing guitar at Kanda Casely-Hayford collaborated with Prof. Mawure Bertie Opoku of the Institute of African Studies, University of Ghana, Legon, and together they established the Ghana National Dance Ensemble. In the early 1960s, Casely-Hayford introduced the Do Show, a talent show that was open to all through auditions. One of the products of the Do Show is the Paris-based singer Bibie Brew. The Ghanaian teens of the 1960s also had their chance and several pop music competitions were held at the Arts Centre. Casely-Hayford's five sons all played guitar in their teens. His oldest son, Ralph, a bassist, and a nephew, Roy, played in one of Ghana's professional pop bands, \\"The Saints\\", and they performed at the Accra Arts Centre. Broadcasting and puppeteering Casely-Hayford developed and promoted puppets and the craft of puppeteering. In addition to puppet shows at the Arts Centre, he also had the puppeteering team visit schools to give performances. He was transferred to Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) as the Cultural Liaison Officer under Shirley Du Bois. Eventually, he was appointed Director of GBC. One of the things that he developed for GBC TV News (now GTV News) was the rotating globe that was used for years until computer graphics took over. He also introduced puppet shows on GBC TV. Some of the puppet shows were based on the popular traditional concert party theatre format.

He was also a jazz pianist. His father, Archie, was a pianist and a composer and his mother, Essie, also played piano and loved to sing and perform. The traditional guitarist Koo Nimo had a lasting relationship with Casely-Hayford and shared many recording hours in later years. Casely-Hayford gave several lectures on Ghana's highlife music; collaborated with the University of Ghana Music Professor John Collins; and served as a founding patron of Bokoor African Popular Music Archives Foundation (BAPMAF), an NGO that Prof. John Collins established in 1990 soon after Casely-Hayford's death in 1989.\\"About Us\\", Bokoor African Popular Music Archives Foundation. Engineering work Casely- Hayford's true passion lay in manufacturing and engineering. Everywhere he lived with his family, he kept his cars outside the garage because he used the garage as an engineering workshop. He involved his five sons in his engineering work and projects.

It was a rock radio hit for the band, reaching number 3 on Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.  Background  In 1992, eight current and former members of Yes toured to support their 1991 album Union. Following the completion of the tour, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman and drummer Bill Bruford left the band, leaving the five members who had performed as Yes during the 1980s: singer Jon Anderson, guitarist Trevor Rabin, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Alan White and keyboardist Tony Kaye. \\"The Calling\\" was written by Rabin, Anderson and Squire, with Rabin producing. As with the other tracks on Talk, \\"The Calling\\" was recorded and mixed digitally, rather than on tape as was done with previous Yes recordings. The song has been described as featuring a modern sound, with heavy focus on Rabin's guitars, and a three-part vocal harmony featuring Anderson, Rabin and Squire. According to Anderson, the song's lyrics were inspired by the concept of \\"local history\\", the current three-thousand year window of history, outside of which mankind has little visibility or understanding.  Chart performance  \\"The Calling\\" was a number-three Mainstream Rock hit for the band in 1994, their last (as of 2010) top-ten hit on that chart. Yes had two subsequent Mainstream Rock hits: 1994's \\"Walls\\" (also from Talk) and 1997's \\"Open Your Eyes\\" from the album of the same name. \\"The Calling\\" has appeared on several Yes compilations.

Built in the late 20th century after a 1977 political reform, the complex is located in Mexico City about a mile east of the Zócalo central square, in the Venustiano Carranza borough or district, next to the Palace of Federal Justice. The complex draws its name from its location, as the San Lázaro Railway Station was the former occupant of the grounds where the palace was built.  History, architecture and restoration Works of the palace, 1981. After the Mexican political reform of 1977, the number of deputies of the Chamber passed from 186 to 400, and thus, it was impossible for them to convene in the former meeting place, then known as the Legislative Palace of Donceles, which is now occupied by the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District. Thereupon, construction on a new seat of the Legislative began as a part of a plan of urban restructuring of the sector where the San Lázaro Station was located, on the limit of the Venustiano Carranza and Cuauhtémoc boroughs. Also on the property was built a new Palace of Federal Justice for the functions of the Judiciary branch of the government. The project, which was promoted by former president José López Portillo, was a faction of a massive development and public works program of the government, resulting from a Mexican petroleum boom. Construction began in September 1979, following the plans of architects Pedro Ramírez Vázquez (who at the time served as Secretary of Settlement and Public Works), Jorge Campuzano, and David Suárez. The grounds were formally inaugurated on 1 September 1981 as a part of the 5th Government Report (the equivalent of the State of the Union Address in Mexico) of López Portillo, and officially at the installation of the deputies and senators of the LI Legislature of the Congress of the Union. The building was severely damaged after a fire in 1989, and President of Mexico Carlos Salinas de Gortari had it restored by Mexican architect Manuel De Santiago-of Bourbon González Bravo (Manuel De Santiago-de Borbón González Bravo), a renowned member of ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites).

The game requires the Kinect accessory for the Xbox 360 version and the PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye Camera for the PlayStation 3 version. There is also a Wii version that does not require any additional accessories to play. Gameplay The PlayStation 3 version is a fitness video game that has training instruction in three separate sections from three champion UFC fighters and trainers: Mark Delagrotte, Greg Jackson, and Javier Mendez. They start with a warm up, followed by stretching, and then the workout the player has selected from the menu under their section, ending with a cool down stretching period. Warm up and cool down are key phases of any UFC fighter's fitness regimen. In fact, some have claimed that Mark Delagrotte's loss to Thai-boxer Nigel Green was partially due to a lack of warm up and cool down during his fight camp. The instructors give tips, instructions, and encouragement throughout the entire workout. There are also occasionally jokes such as when Javier Mendez asks if you \\"need time to wipe your tears\\" when you pause the game mid-workout. The player can work out alone or side-by-side with a partner. They need to plug in the PlayStation Eye Camera and calibrate the PlayStation Move before the disc will go to the menu screen. They will need the PlayStation Leg Strap to hold the PlayStation Move in place when doing the leg exercises. Some players have fashioned alternative leg straps from materials such as rubber bands, masking tape, or twine. The player sets up their account using their height and weight and fitness level during a sequence called \\"The Official Weigh In with Dana White\\". This includes a short fitness test which can be retaken as many times as the player likes. There are workouts under each of the three UFC fighters as well as preset 30 or 60 day workouts. There is also an option to make customized workouts called \\"The Customized Workout with Dana White\\". As the player progresses, there are prizes and trophies they earn and instructional and motivational videos that they unlock. There are also separate activities they can choose for fun or as a break from their work out. The player doesn't need to be a gamer to use this program and it can be used by all genders, fitness levels, heights, weights, and more. Development Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. A GameSpot review said the Xbox 360 version offers the most exhausting workout in video games, but bugs, repetitive programmes, and overlong stretching periods cause the player to tire for the wrong reasons.

Translated as 'act of being', the expression is a metaphysical principle outlined by Aquinas in his Christian reinterpretation of Aristotle. It relates to the essence of a thing, and how we as humans perceive this essence. He thought one could not perceive the essence of God as sense data but rather could only be understood in terms of His act of being, that is, His effects in the real world. Overview Aquinas saw that in any subsisting extramental (existing outside the mind) thing, one finds a couplet of metaphysical principles: one is the \\"essence\\" which makes the thing to be what it is, the other is the which gives the thing and its \\"essence\\" actual existence. The observation that individual things display instantiations of a particular \\"essence\\" led Aquinas to postulate that what gives actual existence to a thing and to its \\"essence\\" – the – is unique, in the sense that the perfection of cannot be said to be common in the way an \\"essence\\" is said to be common. Things instantiating the essence of (being like a horse), for example, are said to be similar because of their . The essence of is what makes horses the same under a common category. However, things instantiating the perfection of are said to be different on account of their . The possession of is what makes things unique and distinct from all other things. Thus, in what actually exists as a subsisting extramental thing, there is an \\"essence\\" which makes the thing what it is (a horse, for example), and the which makes the thing a real, individual, existing thing. Aristotle didn't have the notion of . In fact, the contribution of Aquinas to the philosophy of being is precisely that he discovered that all Aristotelian acts were in reality \\"potency\\" with respect to the . Aquinas saw the metaphysical principle of as the \\"act of all acts, the perfection of all perfections\\",Thomas Aquinas, Quaestiones Disputatae De Potentia, question 7, article 2, ad 9.

See also Summa Theologiae, part I, question 45, article 5, corpus. The metaphysics of Aristotle did not reach that far. Accordingly, Pope John Paul II stresses in his teachings that the philosophy of Aquinas is the philosophy of , \\"whose transcendental value paves the most direct way to rise to the knowledge of subsisting Being and pure Act, namely to God.\\"Pope John Paul II, \\"The Angelicum Address\\", speech delivered at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas Angelicum in Rome on 17 November 1979.

Biography  Moutschen entered the Liège Académie des Beaux-Arts at the age of nine. He received his diploma in 1917 and entered the Association des Architectes de Liège in 1923. He became a professor, then director of the Académie de Beaux-Arts de Liège from 1948 to 1960. Moutschen designed a number of projects around Liège characterized by a pragmatic approach and an extreme sobriety of style. He is most remembered for the Albert I Memorial on the Albert Canal at Liège, built in the form of a lighthouse. Moutschen was a founding member of the International Union of Architects and a member of its executive committee in 1948. He was president of the Belgian Fédération Royale des Architects until 1959.

The route highlights the archaeological and cultural history of southwestern Native American peoples, and traverses the widely diverse geological landscape of the Four Corners region. It was the first National Scenic Byway that was designated solely for its archaeological sites. The entire route is approximately 480 miles (772.5 km) long. Route description The National Scenic Byway crosses the Colorado Plateau of the Four Corners region along prehistoric sites of Native Americans, including the Navajo, Utes and early puebloan people, who lived and farmed in the area from about 1 CE to about 1300 CE. There were people hunting and gathering for food in the Four Corners region by 10,000 B.C. or earlier. Geological features include sandstone-rimmed canyons, snow-capped mountains, red rock landscapes and green valleys.

The house is the birthplace and boyhood home of jazz musician Leon Bismark \\"Bix\\" Beiderbecke and so the house is also known simply as the Bix Beiderbecke House. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1977.  Leon Bismark Beiderbecke  Leon Bismark Beiderbecke, nicknamed Bix, was born in this house on March 10, 1903, and grew up here. with His father, Bismark Herman Beiderbecke, was a son of German immigrants and was the owner of East Davenport Lumber and Coal Company. His mother, Agatha Jane (Hilton) Beiderbecke, was the daughter of a riverboat pilot and was the organist at First Presbyterian Church. Bix learned to play the piano by ear in the family home. By the age of three he could play simple melodies. The Davenport Democrat published an article about his musical accomplishments when he was six years old. As he grew older he would go down to the Mississippi River to listen to the jazz music that could be heard playing on the riverboats. Beiderbecke heard Louis Armstrong play for the first time on one of the boats. He would also stow away and play the calliopes on the boats. His older brother Charles brought home record albums when he returned from serving in World War I that featured the music of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. Bix was drawn to the sound of the band's trumpet player Nick LaRocca. Beiderbecke had bought a second-hand cornet when he was 15, and he would slow the turntable down and learn the trumpet lines note-by-note. He played his first public performance at a vaudeville show in the Davenport High School gym. He went on to perform with Neal Buckley's Novelty Orchestra and the Plantation Jazz Orchestra on the stern-wheeler Majestic. In 1921, Beiderbecke was sent to Lake Forest Academy. Except for a brief period in the early 1920s when he returned home to work for his father, Bix lived the rest of his life away from Davenport as a professional musician playing in jazz bands. He would come home to visit from time to time and when he was here he played with local bands. It is believed that on his visit from December 1924 to January 1925 Bix composed \\"Davenport Blues\\" in this house. Beiderbecke died in New York City in 1931 at the age of 28 and is buried in Oakdale Cemetery in Davenport. Architecture The Beiderbecke house is located in a neighborhood of similar houses from the Late Victorian era. It is built on a property that includes a terrace to the sidewalk. The house is situated across the street from a neighborhood park. The rectangular shaped structure is wide and deep. A full-size porch wraps around from the front to the south side of the house. Above the entrance to the porch is a decorative wooden pediment. Above that is a small semi-circular porch topped with a conical roof. Entrance to the smaller porch is from one of the second-floor bedrooms. There is a two-story bay window section that projects from the south side of the house and a projection on the north side that contains a stairwell. There is a small L-shaped addition on the back of the house (date unknown) that contains an enclosed porch and a family room. The house is topped by an irregular gabled roof.

Volkoff is the head of Volkoff Industries. For the first six episodes of the fourth season, he was an unseen character, directing his operatives from behind the scenes. He first appeared in the seventh episode, \\"Chuck Versus the First Fight\\". For the first twenty-one episodes of the season, Volkoff is presented as the character's actual identity. \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\", however, reveals that Volkoff is actually a cover, which, following a botched Intersect upload, Winterbottom unknowingly adopted as his true identity. Volkoff serves as the main antagonist for the first half of season four and tragic character in the second half. He is portrayed by Timothy Dalton. Biography Mary Elizabeth Bartowski (codename Frost) was ordered by the CIA to track him down when she was placed undercover in his organization under Project ISIS. It was first revealed in \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II\\" and over the course of the first part of the fourth season that Stephen J. Bartowski (codename Orion) had spent the twenty years following Mary's disappearance privately attempting to locate and stop Volkoff. According to Chuck Bartowski's flash in \\"Chuck Versus the Cubic Z,\\" Volkoff is 5'10\\"-6'2\\" tall and speaks Russian, German, and English. He was born in Moscow, Russia on 30 March or 14 May 1959, was indicted in New York for his involvement in arms trafficking, and is wanted for \\"conspiracy to kill United States nationals, to murder, to destroy buildings and property of the United States, and to destroy the national defense utilities of the United States.\\" Volkoff reveals to Dasha that his home address is 17 Tally Place, he has a dog named Kipper, he had his first sexual experience watching Lawrence of Arabia, and he came from a broken home.\\"Chuck Versus the First Fight\\" He later reveals to Devon Woodcomb that he free climbed K2 without oxygen.\\"Chuck Versus the Leftovers\\" It is unknown how much (if any) of this is true, though, as he was posing as Frost's MI6 handler both times. Further, the revelation that Volkoff was born Hartley Winterbottom and raised by his mother in Somerset, England, casts doubt on the place of birth given in Chuck's flash. Series Volkoff has been present in the series as early as \\"Chuck Versus the Cougars,\\" when Heather Chandler attempts to extort F-22 plans from her husband for Volkoff. In \\"Chuck Versus the Cubic Z\\", Volkoff arranges for her to be on the same prison transfer as Hugo Panzer and hires Panzer to kill her for the failure. For the first six episodes of the fourth season, Volkoff directed his operatives from behind the scenes. In \\"Chuck Versus the Anniversary,\\" General Beckman assigned Chuck, Sarah Walker, and John Casey to the same task as Mary. Volkoff first appears in person in \\"Chuck Versus the First Fight.\\" Chuck meets him masquerading as \\"Gregory Tuttle,\\" Frost's enthusiastic, if bumbling and completely inexperienced in the matters of field-work, MI6 handler. With Chuck's assistance, \\"Tuttle\\" escapes several Volkoff agents and helps Chuck recover data that would clear Mary and prove she has been working deep undercover to bring down his organization. However, after being apparently wounded in a gunfight while recovering the disks, Volkoff follows Chuck, Sarah and Mary to Stephen Bartowski's base of operations and reveals himself, explaining that the entire operation was a plan to locate and destroy Stephen's intelligence. He attempted to kill Chuck and Sarah in the explosion that destroyed Stephen's work, but was unknowingly betrayed by Mary, who left a means for them to escape. \\"Chuck Versus the Push Mix\\" confirms that Stephen and Mary had remained in contact ever since her disappearance when going under cover, and that the final key to Volkoff's defeat was a virus written by Stephen which downloaded the entire Hydra database to a computer at his cabin. Volkoff is subsequently arrested by General Beckman. As Volkoff is taken away, he tells Chuck to have his mother come visit, saying, \\"It's been fun.\\" It is revealed in \\"Chuck Versus the Masquerade\\" that Volkoff has a daughter named Vivian McArthur, who he has chosen as his successor. Her whole life, Volkoff had been training Vivian for the spy world without her knowledge. Vivian travels to the sealed Volkoff Industries headquarters in Moscow and enters Volkoff's office. It is revealed that the horse paperweight Volkoff used to shatter Yuri the Gobbler's glass eye is also compatible with a locket he gave to Vivian. Vivian connects the locket, unlocking a secret compartment, revealing a card to access Volkoff's bank vault in Macau, containing various pictures of Vivian's life. Vivian is last shown driving away with Volkoff's lawyer Riley to learn the truth.\\"Chuck Versus the First Bank of Evil\\" She then hires an agent named Damien to kill Chuck, following in her father's footsteps and effectively becoming Chuck's nemesis.\\"Chuck Versus the Muuurder\\" The CIA orders Vivian assassinated, but Chuck refuses to believe that Vivian would hire Damien. In a meet, Vivian gives Chuck a component of a Volkoff weapon known as the \\"Norseman\\". Chuck and Sarah visit Volkoff at River Hill Penitentiary, only to learn that he has begun a path to redemption. In exchange for a meeting with Vivian, Volkoff helps Team Bartowski find the weapon's tracking device and killing agent, along the way apologizing to those he had wronged in the past. When Volkoff panics and nearly gets Chuck and himself killed, Chuck encourages him to return to his old ways. It is then revealed that Vivian had communicated with Volkoff simply by giving Chuck the Norseman, and he goes to rejoin her. However, Vivian refuses to forgive her father or Chuck for their lying and leaves them to die. However, Volkoff saves the team, returning to spiritual ways. Before being returned to prison, Volkoff meets with Mary one last time and reminds her, \\"Remember, family and friends are everything. Money, greed, and power are a dance with Satan. And he looks like me.\\" In \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\", Chuck, Ellie, and the rest of the team discover that the CIA and Orion created Volkoff as a cover for Agent X, an English scientist named Hartley Winterbottom and a close friend of Stephen Bartowski. This was part of an early Intersect version implanted into Winterbottom shortly before Chuck was born, but the implant malfunctioned and apparently permanently overwrote Winterbottom's own personality with that of his cover identity. Casey recognizes the danger of what they have learned, and he hides Winterbottom's spy will and the key to protect them from government retribution. In \\"Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger\\", Chuck seeks out Volkoff to help him find a cure for the Norseman, which Vivian used on Sarah. Unfortunately, CIA agent Clyde Decker, who was involved in the coverup of Agent X, anticipated his move and had Volkoff deprogrammed to his original identity as Hartley, who has no recollection of the past thirty years. Nonetheless, he tries to help Chuck by preparing an antidote but it is not strong enough for Sarah. Learning from Mary that Volkoff was developing an improved version of the antidote, he and Chuck went to Volkoff Industries, only for Hartley to get cold feet and run away. He later came back and talked down Vivian from killing Chuck. It is also revealed that he volunteered to go undercover and convinced Stephen to use his Intersect program on him. He and Vivian then start new lives with flawless IDs provided by Casey. He also sends Chuck and Sarah all the controlling interest shares to Volkoff Industries, allowing them to purchase the Buy More and start a freelance spy operation. Development It was announced in October 2010 that actor Timothy Dalton (famous for the role of James Bond in The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill) was cast in a recurring role as Mary's MI6 handler, Tuttle, who has a connection to Mary in the past. Series co-creator Josh Schwartz told Entertainment Weekly, \\"It's not the kind of character you'd [expect] him to play. There's nothing suave or debonair about him.\\" The reveal of Volkoff's true identity was highly praised. Eric Goldman of IGN has praised Dalton's performance, writing that he \\"continues to shine as Volkoff. The mixture of menace and humor he brings is perfect.\\" Goldman asked, \\"How can you not share the delight of a villain who boasts that his boat has state of the art weaponry and security, 'and an old-fashioned ice cream parlor!' The fact that he was later seen having a menacing conversation, while eating ice cream, only added to that epicness.\\" Personality In his first appearance, he claimed to be able to kill a man with a plastic fork. When threatened with torture by Dasha, he instantly reveals several irrelevant details about his life. It is later revealed that Alexei loves Mary and will go to great lengths to protect her. However, he would rather kill Mary than let her live without him. When holding people at gunpoint, Volkoff cocks the hammer of his semi- automatic pistol, an action unnecessary due to recoil operation, simply because he likes the sound. Volkoff reveals to Sarah that he is a romantic who appreciates \\"paintings, poetry, the art of massage.\\" He later gleefully discusses Yuri the Gobbler by saying, \\"Don't ask why he's called that... It's because he eats people!\\" In the same episode, he expresses his disappointment before shooting Yuri in the head without hesitation.\\"Chuck Versus the Gobbler\\" In \\"Chuck Versus the Push Mix\\", Volkoff reveals that the password to unlock Hydra is \\"Death is the solution to all problems,\\" a quote from his \\"favorite poet and humanitarian, Joseph Stalin.\\" Although Volkoff claims to be loved by children, the longest he ever saw his own daughter was ten minutes, with years between each meeting.\\"Chuck Versus the Masquerade\\" Volkoff's customary greeting is a kiss to both cheeks and, in Chuck's case, the lips.\\"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\\" \\"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\\" saw a drastic change in Volkoff's personality, as counseling sessions in prison have led him to regret the way he has lived his life. To prove that he is a changed man, he takes every opportunity to apologize to those he has wronged in the past. He is shown to play chess, nearly getting himself and Chuck killed when he panics after being checked in a computer chess game. It suddenly dawns upon him that he does not want to die. After encouragement by Chuck to return to his old ways, Volkoff is shown to have led the automated player into a trap, paralleling the way he has manipulated Team Bartowski throughout the episode. When his daughter leaves him to die for lying to her, however, Volkoff appears to have genuinely changed. It is first revealed in \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\" that Alexei Volkoff is actually a constructed identity. As Agent X, Volkoff possesses two distinct personalities: the dangerous arms dealer and his true, long lost personality as the gentle scientist with a dislike for guns, Hartley Winterbottom.

Krieger ( - ) was a judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court known for his work fighting for civil rights for gays, minorities and the disadvantaged. As an openly gay judge, he served as Chairperson of the Sexual Orientation Fairness Subcommittee of the California Judicial Council's Access and Fairness Advisory Committee. He was a co-founder of the world's first gay and lesbian synagogue. He served on the 2nd District Court of Appeal by special temporary appointment, and he hoped for a permanent post on that court. Early life and education Krieger was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of an ophthalmologist. After studying astronomy at the Summer Science Program as a high school student in 1960, he graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a bachelor's degree in political science and then from the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law in 1968. Professional career and judicial service As a California Deputy Attorney General, he was elected in 1974 to be president of the Association of Deputy Attorneys General. In private practice starting in 1977, he handled civil cases. Krieger was the chairman and treasurer for 1980 reelection campaign of Mike Roos for California State Assembly. Roos recommended Krieger as a judicial appointee. California Governor Jerry Brown named Krieger to the Los Angeles Municipal Court on December 31, 1982. It was Brown's last day before leaving office at the end of his second term. Krieger was the fifth and final openly gay judge appointed by Brown in his second term as governor, after having appointed none in his first term. Krieger noted that \\"The importance of my appointment was in the fact that it did not make headlines.\\" Krieger joined the Municipal Court in 1983 and served until 1988, becoming the presiding judge of its Encino branch. In 1988, Krieger successfully ran for an open seat on the Los Angeles County Superior Court, winning by a large margin. He was unopposed for reelection in 1994 and 2000 and served on the Superior Court bench until his death from cancer on February 14, 2002. Krieger said that \\"the first time I imposed the death sentence\\" was one of his most memorable cases on the bench. On the other hand, \\"civil trials are easy. Heck, it's only about money.\\" He regularly received praise from lawyers for his legal knowledge and fair decisions. He kept jurors involved and interested through long trials. Equal rights Krieger served as a role model on the bench for many openly gay judges who followed him. He was a member of the California Judicial Council's Access and Fairness Advisory Committee and was chairperson of its Sexual Orientation Fairness Subcommittee. The subcommittee conducted a six-year study, which was the first of its kind in the nation. It found many situations where people in the courts system, including parties to cases, workers, and jurors, were subject to bias. Krieger stated, \\"The study shows that there is both a perception and in some cases actual unequal treatment based upon sexual orientation.\\" \\"It's a wake-up call of how much work needs to be done,\\" said Jon W. Davidson, attorney for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. \\"It has important consequences, because gays and lesbians are going to use the court system. The courts need to deal with [the inequalities] if they're committed to open access for all people.\\" Commenting on the study, Krieger said it is the laws that are prejudiced, not the judges and court employees. \\"I can be very fair,\\" he said. \\"But I'm still not permitted to do a marriage of a gay couple.\\" Krieger's subcommittee made many recommendations for \\"ensuring that the court system is fair and accessible to all persons in the state of California\\" in regards to sexual orientation. These included improving training, developing a diverse pool of clerks and interns, changing the Standards of Judicial Administration to prevent retaliation against whistleblowers, and studying bias in hiring and promotion. Krieger also was a co-founder in 1972 of the world's first gay and lesbian synagogue, Temple Beth Chayim Chadashim. \\"In the gay community, you don't feel you can be Jewish, and in the Jewish community, you don't feel you can be gay. I'm still a Jew, and I'm also gay. The temple brings it together.\\" Judge Krieger was co-chair of the Lesbian and Gay Caucus of the California Democratic Party. He developed a reputation as a civil rights activist and political strategist for Democratic candidates. He inspired and help found the Lawyers for Human Rights (now called the Lesbian and Gay Lawyers Association of Los Angeles) in 1979 and became its second president. Rabbi Lisa Edwards of Temple Beth Chayim Chadashim recalls that Judge Krieger \\"used to laugh and sigh with me at the irony that the state of California authorized the two of us to officiate and sign marriage licenses - could even do so for a couple who had been together one day - but that same state of California wouldn't let either of us marry our own partners of so many years.\\" Krieger's life partner was Jon Smith.

This day commemorates the first public performance of Charles-Émile Reynaud's Théâtre Optique at the Grevin Museum in Paris, 1892. In 1895, the Cinematograph of the Lumière brothers outshone Reynaud's invention, driving Émile to bankruptcy. However, his public performance of animation entered the history of optical entertainments as shortly predating the camera-made movies. In recent years, the event has been observed in more than 50 countries with more than 1000 events, on every continent, all over the world. IAD was initiated by ASIFA, International Animated Film Association, a member of UNESCO. During International Animation Day cultural institutions are also invited to join in by screening animated films, organizing workshops, exhibiting artwork and stills, providing technical demonstrations, and organizing other events helping to promote the art of animation. Such a celebration is an outstanding opportunity of putting animated films in the limelight, making this art more accessible to the public. ASIFA also commissions an artist to create an original art poster announcing the event each year. It is then adapted for each country in order to guarantee a worldwide view of the event. Previous editions involved the work of animators such as Iouri Tcherenkov, Paul Driessen, Abi Feijo, Eric Ledune, Noureddin Zarrinkelk, Michel Ocelot, Nina Paley, Raoul Servais, Ihab Shaker and Gianluigi Toccafondo. Full length animation films, historical features, animated shorts, and student films, all variety of animation art are shown in the workshops. These films display an extraordinary range of techniques – drawing, painting, animating puppets and objects, using clay, sand, paper, and computer. Because many animated films are non-verbal, it is a rich opportunity for cross cultural expression and communication.

He was a Los Angeles Ranger, filibuster, soldier, lawyer, journalist and newspaper publisher, and author of two Southern California history books. History Horace Bell was born in Indiana on December 11, 1830. He was educated in Kentucky and then came to Placerville in El Dorado County in eastern California in August 1850 for the California Gold Rush. He spent two years mining with little success. He came to Los Angeles in 1852 to visit an uncle, Alexander Bell, who had settled there in 1842 and married a Mexican Californio, He became wealthy as a trader and influential in politics. Horace Bell became a founding member of the Los Angeles Rangers, a militia company that pursued outlaws in the most violent, lawless county in Southern California. In 1856, he left California to join in the Walkers Filibuster into Nicaragua, becoming a Major in Walkers army. In 1859 he joined Benito Juárez's Army in Mexico during the Reform War.

In this sense, this linear response function is a generalization of the electrical conductivity, which is usually considered in the static limit, i.e., for a time-independent (or sufficiently slowly varying) electric field. While the static electrical conductivity is vanishingly small in insulators (such as Diamond or Porcelain), the optical conductivity always remains finite in some frequency intervals (above the optical gap in the case of insulators); the total optical weight can be inferred from sum rules. The optical conductivity is closely related to the dielectric function, the generalization of the dielectric constant to arbitrary frequencies. Only in the simplest case (coarse-graining, long-wavelength limit, cubic symmetry of the material), these properties can be considered as (complex-valued) scalar functions of the frequency only. Then, the electric current density \\\\mathbf{J} (a three-dimensional vector), the scalar optical conductivity \\\\sigma and the electric field vector \\\\mathbf{E} are linked by the equation :\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\omega) = \\\\sigma(\\\\omega) \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\omega) while the dielectric function \\\\varepsilon relates the electrical displacement to the electric field: :\\\\mathbf{D}(\\\\omega) = \\\\varepsilon(\\\\omega) \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\omega) In SI units, this implies the following connection between the two linear response functions: :\\\\varepsilon(\\\\omega) = \\\\varepsilon_0 + \\\\frac{i \\\\sigma(\\\\omega)}{\\\\omega}, where \\\\varepsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity and i denotes the imaginary unit. The optical conductivity is most often measured in the optical frequency ranges via the reflectivity of polished samples under normal incidence (in combination with a Kramers–Kronig analysis) or using variable incidence angles. For samples that can be prepared in thin slices, higher precision is usually obtainable using optical transmission experiments. In order to get more complete information about the electronic properties of the material of interest, such measurements have to be combined with other techniques that work in remaining frequency ranges, e.g., in the static limit or at microwave frequencies.

For many years, European hotels have used them as combined towel- dryers/racks. The towel warmer is a bathroom heater suitable for both drying and heating towels and the environment. There are two versions: traditional ones that are plumbed like a radiator with water heated from a central boiler, and electric ones where an electrical resistance heats water or oil contained in the unit  Composition and functioning  Towel dryers can be made from different metals such as steel, stainless steel, or aluminum. In some types, brass or copper is used. The finish can be in chrome plating, polished steel, or lacquer. Dryers can be heated electrically (heating cartridge or heating cable), or by circulating hot water (connected to the central heating). Often, a combination of the methods is used. In these cases, the dryer is heated by hot water in wintertime, and by electricity in the summer. A towel dryer, with high output, can also serve as a radiator in a small bathroomHeating process. Dryers come in a variety of appearances, including: ladder types, turnable types, and others.  Advantages and disadvantages  = Advantages = Hanger for Heated towel rail The first advantage of this radiator is the aesthetic value that can help to enrich rooms with a touch of style. Another advantage is obviously the possibility of drying towels more quickly because they are put in direct contact with the radiant body. The towel warmer uses less water than a classic plate radiator or a cast iron radiator, so it is considered a little more ecological and more economical in terms of consumption. Its shapes are very different from each other and this can allow us to structure radiator, adapting it perfectly to rooms. There are towel warmers of different sizes, from the smallest (even of 27 in × 20 in - 70 cm × 50 cm) to larger ones that can even reach 79 in (2 meters) in height. = Disadvantages = The first disadvantage is directly linked to one of its advantages, namely the possibility of drying our towels faster. The problem is that covering part of the pipes and the radiant body, the energy, consumption and time required to bring the room to temperature will be bigger than a radiator free of “obstacles”. It is from this need that radiator accessories and hangers have been developed, in this specific case to maintain the advantages by eliminating some disadvantages. Another shortcoming is the poor heating power, linked to the positioning of the tubes which is reverse to the sense of convection. To heat larger rooms, therefore it takes a greater dimension, going to lose the aesthetic value.

Jackson from the Group of Seven. His many paintings and sketches, now housed at the City of Ottawa archives, Ottawa City Hall, small galleries and private collections, celebrate the rough beauty of Canadian landscapes, and the tenacity of man-made structures set in rugged natural and urban environments, particularly in the Ottawa Valley region.  Professional career  Burton produced numerous sketches and paintings over his lifetime, with many of his finest executed in oil on birch plywood panels. He studied art professionally in Ottawa (1923–24) and was a student under A.Y. Jackson at the Banff School of Fine Arts (1947). He later became a friend and painting companion to A.Y. Jackson, who greatly influenced his work. Over a period spanning more than 20 years, they travelled the lengths of Eastern Ontario and Quebec, as well as Alberta, Alaska and the Yukon territory together, depicting the environs, physical structures and, less frequently, the people of the regions they visited. Burton was also widely regarded in the Ottawa region as a skilled art teacher, with one student remarking on Burton's \\"love of colour,\\" \\"assured draughtsmanship\\" and \\"powerful observation\\" evident in his works. Another student and art historian observes that Burton's works are \\"very rhythmical...straight lines were rare, things are always flowing and moving through his brush strokes and the variation in colours.\\" Despite his successful art career, Burton often had to juggle full- and part-time work to support his family. As one biographical sketch recounts, \\"Ralph began using his art as a bartering tool to acquire food, fuel, make car repairs -- everything necessary for survival.\\" He also occasionally took on commissions for calendars and Christmas cards. During World War II, Burton enlisted in the RCAF and worked in Ottawa as an administrative war art officer.  Works  Burton is often referred to as a plein air artist whose body of work focuses largely on natural Canadian landscapes in formidable climates. Yet he was a prolific painter who also enjoyed rendering city scapes and capturing the play of colour, form and light of exterior structures. In fact, arguably the most widely viewed of his paintings today are from his Lebreton Flats series. Lebreton Flats was once a working-class neighbourhood in Ottawa's west end that saw its land expropriated in the 1960s by the Federal government and slated for demolition and urban renewal. The politicians of the day referred to the area as a \\"slum\\" that needed to be eradicated from an otherwise blossoming city, but Burton saw the area as a vibrant and hard-working neighbourhood that many people called home. As one art historian put it, \\"Working just ahead of the demolition crews, Ralph Burton produced a series of small oil sketches that document the final months of Lebreton Flats...[and he] rendered these architectural portraits with powerful observation.\\" The author also notes that while Burton's artistic style is generally described as \\"free\\" and \\"abbreviated,\\" he was nevertheless \\"a meticulous recorder of architectural detail.\\" Several of Burton's works are available for public viewing in small galleries across the country. The Ottawa Art Gallery houses his Bennett Lake, Ontario near Perth (1975, oil on plywood); Sun Drawing Water (1977, oil on plywood); Reflection on the Road, Richmond, Ontario (1970, oil on panel) and AYJ Snoozing With Paper in Hand in Hotel Room, Calabogie ON 1960 (oil on plywood).The Ottawa Art Gallery - Search Results The Ottawa Art Gallery - Search Results The Ottawa Art Gallery - Search Results The Ottawa Art Gallery - Search Results Rolling Hills is on display at the Tom Thomson Memorial Art Gallery, a bequest of A.Y.

They were formed in 2006 by Cevin Soling, and in January 2007 they released their debut album Happy Suicide, Jim!, a thirteen track CD with philosophical and anti-consumerist themes. The band's original lineup consists of Bill Brandau on keyboard, Cevin Soling on vocals and guitar, Jim Minics on guitar, Darren Pilato on bass, and Jaron Stewart on drums.  Founding  The band was originally formed by Cevin Soling. Soling runs the record company Xemu Records and also Spectacle Films. Soling had grown up listening to The Beatles. After his last band The Neanderthal Spongecake broke up in 2001, Soling had accrued a number of songs he had written, and in 2006 he began contacting musicians he had played with or was friendly with to form a band. Bill Brandau, who had played with Soling in The Neanderthal Spongecake and had previously been in The Vinnie Barbarino Experience, took on keyboard duties. Darren Pilato was asked to play bass, and Jaron Stewart of the band Merkaba was included after also working on Soling's previous album release, When Pigs Fly. Jim Minics joined as guitarist; his 2003 band Minix had been a semi-finalist in the Independent Music World Series. They are based in New York City. The band name was largely inspired by author Neil Postman's summation of A Brave New World, where instead of being subjugated and destroyed by things we hate, humanity is oppressed by the things they love.  Happy Suicide, Jim!  On January 9, 2007 the band nationally released their debut CD Happy Suicide, Jim! It was published on Soling's Xemu Records, mixed by Martin Trum, engineered by Jim Sommers, and produced by Soling. All 13 songs were recorded at The Loft, Cheektowaga, and Penny Lane in New York City. In January the album peaked at number 162 on CMJs Top 200. The album was also No. 1 on KZMU and had a long run in the top 5 albums in Montreal. The song \\"Authenticity\\" was played and featured on the Public Radio Exchange. The album cover and name are a reference to cult leader Jim Jones.  Style  The band members have specified they prefer \\"alternative rock\\" as a descriptor, though reviewers have also described them as post-punk and experimental. Reviewers have described a similarity to the intellectual rock bands in the early 1990s, such as Devo, Gang of Four, Butthole Surfers, Frank Zappa, and Mothers of Invention. = Lyrical themes = All lyrics are written by Soling, who claims to be influenced by writers such as Guy Debord, founder of the Situationist International, and Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World and Yellow Chrome. They also focus on the \\"bio-genetic studies on the evolution of despair\\" and outline opposition to the instant gratification of consumer culture.

It runs from Maastricht in the Netherlands, through Riemst in Belgian Limburg almost to the city of Liège in Belgium, thus defining the topography of this border area between Flanders, Wallonia and the Netherlands. The name of the hill, as well as the nearby village and church of Sint Pieter and the fortress of Sint Pieter, refers to Saint Peter, one of the Twelve Apostles. Principal characteristics  The plateau, of which Mount Saint Peter is part, is bounded on the east by the Meuse river (Dutch: Maas) and on the west by the Geer (Jeker). Since the 1930s, the Albert Canal divides the hill in two sections. Near the small Liège province village of Lanaye (Dutch: Ternaaien) the canal cuts through the ridge over a length of and deep. The Lanaye locks at the eastern end of the cut permit boats to pass from the upper Meuse and the Albert Canal to the lower Meuse and Rhine basin. To the east of these locks the Meuse has altered its course, creating backwaters and old channels. Mount Saint Peter's limestone composition, its deposits of flint nodules and its geographic position make it a remarkable place. The locale has been mined for flint from Neolithic times. The network of mining tunnels extended by the 19th century but was severely shortened in the 20th century by surface mining. These days Mount Saint Peter is considered an important nature reserve, as well as an area for recreation and tourism. History Section of Caestert Plateau where the Albert Canal can be seen cutting through the ridge In the part of Mount Saint Peter that is in the Flemish municipality of Riemst, archaeological evidence of an Iron Age fortress has been found. The fortress is one of the strongest contenders for being identified as the fortress Atuatuca of the Eburones, which played an important role in Julius Caesar's commentaries on his wars in Gaul. Dendrochronological evidence was once thought to count against this proposal, but more recent review of the evidence has reinvigorated the idea. During the Middle Ages several castles were built on the hill, of which various ruins remain. The hill was favoured by attackers during the various sieges of Maastricht, most notably by Louis XIV of France in the Siege of Maastricht (1673). As a result of this, the fortress Sint-Pieter was built on the northern edge. Around 1765 the skull of a Mosasaurus was discovered here in a limestone quarry, one of the first recognised reptile fossils, which was later acquired by the Teylers Museum in Haarlem. A more famous Mosasaurus fossil was found between 1770 and 1774 but was confiscated by the French in 1794 and is now in the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris. Later dinosaur remains were discovered here as well, belonging to Betasuchus and Orthomerus, as well as turtles and fossils of smaller creatures of the sea. From 1930 through 1939 the Albert Canal was constructed, cutting through parts of Mount Saint Peter. The first ships went through in 1940. The hill's strategic location made it the site of Fort Eben- Emael (1931–35), a major artillery defence point in the Belgian defences against any invading forces coming from Nazi Germany. At the opening of the war, the entire installation was taken quickly by a relatively small number of German paratroopers.

The succeeding geologic layers include loess, gravel, quartz sand and chalky limestone of the Maastricht Formation with inclusions of flint. The chalk deposits contain numerous fossils of sea urchins, clams and belemnites. Humans have used the site since the lower Paleolithic period. The area around Spiennes is known for its flint mines. Limestone has been quarried in the area for building stone and fertilizer for many centuries. Several of Maastricht's medieval churches were built from local stone, incorrectly referred to as mergel (marl). The quarrying of limestone has created a vast network of subterranean corridors, also incorrectly referred to as grotten (caves). Although vast sections of these \\"caves\\" have now disappeared through surface mining, other sections are well- preserved. Guided tours of these limestone quarries, some with ancient inscriptions, drawings and other works of art, constitute one of Maastricht's main tourist attractions. In modern times limestone from Mount Saint Peter continues to be quarried in surface mines, mainly for portland cement production. Abandoned quarries in the Belgian part of the hill are used to dispose of ashes from municipal waste incinerators. A large quarry and cement factory operated by ENCI exists since 1921 in the Dutch part of the hill. The quarrying of limestone in a protected nature area was controversial for many years but for economic reasons ENCI was able to extract most of the mount's limestone, creating a vast area of connected quarries. In 2010 it was decided that by 2018 the quarry will close down. Various plans for redevelopment of both the quarry and the factory site have been presented in recent years. Parts of the quarry that were abandoned years ago have been taken over by nature once again. Ecology View from the mount of the village of Kanne Mount Saint Peter is a Natura 2000 protection area. Because of its limestone soil, the hill is exceptional in its botanical variety. It is the northern limit for a number of species of orchids due to its favorable microclimate. Some of the orchids found there include: Aceras anthropophorum, Ophrys apifera, Ophrys insectifera, Orchis militaris, Orchis purpurea and Platanthera bifolia. An abandoned part of the ENCI quarry has become in recent years the breeding ground of the Eurasian eagle-owl, locally known as oehoe (pronounced: uhu). Mount Saint Peter supports the richest environment for bats in Benelux, as well as the richest environment for orchids in Benelux. The Dutch part of the plateau is largely owned by the Dutch society for preservation of nature monuments Natuurmonumenten. A sheep herd is used to keep vegetation open in certain areas.

On the northeastern section, now overlooking the ENCI quarry as well as the river Meuse, is the farmstead Lichtenberg, largely dating from the 18th century but which includes an 11th- century keep. Further south, in the Walloon municipality of Visé, is another ruined castle overlooking the Meuse, Caestert, of which only some of the farm buildings remain. Well-preserved is the 16th-century house De Torentjes (\\"The little towers\\"), at the bottom of the hill in the village of Sint Pieter.

The fortress was recently restored to reflect its original state. The old village of Sint Pieter was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège until 1794. The medieval church was replaced in the 19th century by the present Gothic Revival building by architect Jules Kayser. South of the village remnants of the 17th-century Franciscan Slavante Monastery can be seen, including a small baroque chapel dedicated to Saint Anthony. Nearby, an elegant pavilion, 'Casino' Slavante, was built in 1846 by a Maastricht military gentlemen's club. A sinister reminder of World War II is the fortress Eben-Emael, constructed in 1931–35 to protect the Belgian border near the Albert Canal.

Robinson was born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear and was a keen rugby player. He was commissioned into the RAF in 1933 and joined No. 35 Squadron RAF in 1941 after completing a tour of duty as a pilot on Whitley bombers. On 18 December 1941 he was involved in an air raid on German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and was awarded the DFC for his actions. In March 1942 he was appointed commander of 35 Squadron which became a pathfinder unit. On the night of 18/19 November 1942 after a raid on Turin, Italy a target indicator flare left hanging in the 22 ft long bomb bay of Robinson's aircraft burst into flames whilst he was flying over the Alps. He ordered the crew to bail out and stayed at the controls whilst they did so to maintain level flight. However, by the time they had all jumped he realised that the flames had died down. He therefore decided to attempt to fly the large aircraft back to England over hostile territory without a navigator, flight engineer, wireless operator or air gunners. He was subsequently promoted to group captain and appointed the station commander at RAF Graveley. He died on the night of 23/24 August 1943 near Wensickendorf, Germany when his Halifax HR928Record for Halifax HR928 on lostaircraft.com was shot down by a nightfighter during a raid on Berlin.

The bronze sculpture from 1908 depicts two men, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich von Schiller, one holding a laurel wreath and the other a scroll. The 12 foot artwork rests upon a 26 foot long granite base. The bronze sculpture is a recasting of the statue incorporated into the 1857 Goethe-Schiller Monument in Weimar, Germany. Description The Goethe-Schiller Monument consists of two men standing side by side. One of the men, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe passes a laurel wreath to the younger man, Friedrich von Schiller, who holds a scroll in his proper left hand. Goethe is attired in a knee-length coat, a shirt with a ruffled collar, a vest and leggings. Schiller is attired in a mid-calf length coat, a vest and leggings. Control number IAS WI000354. The sculpture stands atop a tiered granite base containing an exedra. The sculpture has three inscriptions. On the lowest left side of the sculpture it says: RIETSCHEL, ERNEST F. On the front of the plinth, in incised letters, it says: GOETHE SCHILLER. On the front of the base it says: GOETHE SCHILLER. The granite base contains three plaques. The plaque on the left side reads: : Was Du ererbt von Deinen : Vätern hast Erwirb es, : um es zu besitzen : Johann Wolfgang von Goethe : 1749–1832 : Weltbürger – World Citizen These are lines from Goethe’s Faust I.i, \\"That which you inherit from your fathers / You must earn in order to possess.\\"—Goethe’s Faust, trans. Randall Jarrell, p. 35 (1976). The plaque on the right side reads: : Wer nichts waget : der darf nichts hoffen : Friedrich von Schiller : 1759–1805 These lines are from Schiller's Wallenstein: \\"Who dares nothing, need hope for nothing.\\" The plaque in the center reads: : Erected by the German Citizens of Wisconsin : and dedicated to the city-June 14, 1908 : Rededicated September 4, 1960 : German-American Societies of Milwaukee, Wisconsin : Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 250th birthday : August 28, 1749 : celebrated on August 1, 1999 by the : German-American Societies of Milwaukee, Wisconsin The Goethe-Schiller Monument is administered by the Milwaukee County, Department of Parks, Recreation and Culture. Short video of sculpture. Historical information Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich von Schiller were both highly influential German poets, dramatists and writers that became friends in Weimar, Thuringia. The Germans that came to the United States after 1848, as well as the German thinkers who came after 1870, brought Goethe and Schiller's ideas with them. Originally, the Milwaukee Swabian Benevolent Society wanted to erect a monument to Schiller, a fellow Swabian, but other Milwaukee German societies wanted to participate in the monument's creation. In 1902 thirty organizations and various private donors, including local families such as the Vogels, Brumders, and Nunnemachers, formed a monument association to raise funds for the artwork. They raised $10,000 for the monument and $5,000 for the pedestal. \\"In 1908, a coalition of German groups had little trouble agreeing that Germania in Milwaukee should be represented by a copy of the bronze statue created by artist Ernest Rietschel for the front of the Dresden Court Theater in Weimar, Saxony. The larger community was quick to accept the monument.\\" The Milwaukee monument was thus cast by the foundry in Lauchhammer, Germany from Rietschel's original 1857 mold. The monument was dedicated on June 12, 1908 as part of a great celebration that included thousands of people singing and reading Goethe's and Schiller's works, a dedication speech by Christian Steger, and a gymnastics demonstration. The monument had to be moved from its previous location in Washington Park to its current location west of the Emil Blatz Temple of Music in 1960 because of Highway 41's location. The rededication ceremonies took place on September 1, 1960. A time capsule that had been placed in the base of the monument was found. It contained both German and English newspapers and magazines, records of the Schiller-Goethe Association and copies of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Social Democratic Herald. There are four Goethe-Schiller Monuments in the United States, each incorporating a copy of Rietschel's 1857 bronze in Weimar. In addition to Milwaukee, they are in San Francisco (1901), Cleveland (1907), and Syracuse (1911).

The Adarsh Housing Society is a 31-story building constructed on prime real estate in Colaba, Mumbai, for the welfare of war widows and personnel of India's Ministry of Defence. Over a period of several years, politicians, bureaucrats and military officers allegedly conspired to bend several rules concerning land ownership, zoning, floor space index and membership getting themselves flats allotted in this cooperative society at below-market rates. The scam was unearthed in November 2010 which forced the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan, to resign. In 2011, a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said, \\"The episode of Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society reveals how a group of select officials, placed in key posts, could subvert rules and regulations in order to grab prime government land – a public property – for personal benefit.\\" In January 2011, the Maharashtra government set up a two-member judicial commission to inquire into the matter. The commission was headed by retired High Court judge Justice J A Patil, with N N Kumbhar acting as member secretary. After deposing 182 witnesses over 2 years, the commission submitted its final report in April 2013 to the Maharashtra government. The report highlighted 25 illegal allotments, including 22 purchases made by proxy. The report also indicted four former chief ministers of Maharashtra: Ashok Chavan, Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushilkumar Shinde and Shivajirao Nilangekar Patil, 2 former urban development ministers: Rajesh Tope and Sunil Tatkare and 12 top bureaucrats for various illegal acts. The allottees included Devyani Khobragade. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are currently investigating allegations that three former chief ministers of Maharashtra – Sushilkumar Shinde, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ashok Chavan – were involved in the scam. Alleged violations The Adarsh Society high-rise was constructed in the Colaba locality of Mumbai. This is considered a sensitive coastal area by the Indian Defence forces and is the location of various Indian defence establishments. The society is also alleged to have violated Indian environment ministry rules. The scam is notable for the fact that it was enacted over a period of ten years and required the active involvement of successive officials in many crucial posts. Rules and regulations across many departments and ministries, both at the Centre and the state of Maharashtra, were flouted or bent to allow for the construction of the building. Some of the more blatant transgressions included: obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Army towards construction of the building in a sensitive zone, getting the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) development plan modified, and obtaining another NOC for residential development in a Coastal Regulation Zone, often through manipulation of records and misrepresentation of facts. Efforts by honest officers to bring this to the notice of top officials were ignored. The issue was first raised in a newspaper report in 2003 but did not evoke any official reaction. In 2010, it was again raised by various newspapers and TV channels. Questions were raised about the manner in which apartments in the building were allocated to bureaucrats, politicians and army personnel who had nothing to do with the Kargil War and the way in which clearances were obtained for the construction of the building of the Adarsh Society. It had led to the resignation of the then Chief Minister, Ashok Chavan. Some of the current allottees of the flats in the Adarsh co-operative society building have offered to return their flats, denying allegations that they were allotted flats because they influenced or helped, in some manner, the construction of the society by violating the rules. In an interview to The Hindu published on 26 March 2012, General VK Singh, the Chief of Army Staff ascribed many of the attempts to malign him during his tenure to, amongst others, those he described as \\"the Adarsh lobby\\", those directly connected to the scam, as well as those who were affected by his efforts to rid the army of corruption. Current state of investigation Several inquiries have been ordered by the army and the Government to probe into the irregularities. = Bombay High Court monitoring of CBI investigation = There was a spate of petitions filed in Bombay High Court seeking to monitor CBI investigation. The petitions are Criminal PIL No. 34 of 2010 by former Journalist Ketan Tirodkar, Criminal Writ Petition No. 3359 of 2010 by Simpreet Singh and Criminal PIL No. 36 of 2010 by Mahendra Singh. Ref. Bombay High Court order dated 17 Feb. 2011 . By this order High Court asked CBI to amend the F.I.R. by adding Benami Properties Transaction Act section 4. Also, the High Court transferred the missing filed probe from Mumbai Police to CBI. Praveen Wategaonkar filed Criminal PIL later seeking invoking of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) into the case. So it has been invoked and Enforcement Directorate came into picture. Reacting to these petitions and based on the slow pace of the investigation in the last two years, Bombay High Court severely castigated Enforcement Directorate for its failure to initiate any probe in the matter on 28 February 2012. Expressing its unhappiness the court observed, \\"It is unfortunate that ED has remained a mute spectator. There is a serious lapse on the agency's part for not probing into money laundering offence. ED has not moved an inch. It reflects a sorry state of affairs. We are summoning the director as there has been no assistance from his department to the court.\\" The Court also rapped the CBI for the tardiness in its investigations (begun in January 2011). The High Court, again on 12 March 2012, severely castigated the CBI for not arresting any of the accused in spite of having evidence and ordered it to take action without fear or favour. ED having registered a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, has decided to launch attachment proceedings of the flats after going through the latest chargesheet filed by CBI. In a landmark judgement, the Bombay high court on 29 April 2016, ordered the demolition of the building. = Arrests = Following the Court's criticism, the CBI carried out eight arrests including two retired Major Generals TejK Kaul and AR Kumar, retired brigadier MM Wanchoo, former General Officer Commanding(GOC) of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa, Adarsh promoter Kanhaiyalal Gidwani and Pradeep Vyas, the then city collector and currently, finance secretary (expenditure) in the Govt. of Maharashtra. Accordingly, on 22 March 2012, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Prithviraj Chavan announced in the legislative assembly that the two IAS officers whose names have figured in the scam, Pradeep Vyas and Jairaj Phatak have been suspended from government service. According to newspaper reports, many of the arrested hold more than one flat in the society in fictitious names. Former Congress MLC Kanhaiyalal Gidwani was reported to have as many as ten flats, which he had bought on behalf of top politicians. Gidwani and his son had been earlier arrested on 6 March 2012, by the CBI for trying to influence CBI officials investigating their alleged involvement in the Adarsh scam. In a further twist to the case, the CBI officers arrested their own lawyers, J K Jagiasi and Mandar Goswami. Jagiasi allegedly asked an Air India (AI) official, one of the accused in the case, to pay a bribe of Rs 5 million in exchange for diluting charges levelled against him. The petty cash books maintained by Jagiasi helped unearth the conspiracy. In addition, Rs 2.5 million was allegedly paid to Goswami. He was the Special Counsel in the Ministry of Law and Justice and at present is working as Retainer Counsel for CBI. According to CBI sources, the tainted AI official approached the CBI for dilution of the case filed against him. Jairaj Phatak and Ramanand Tiwari were arrested by the CBI on 3 April 2012, for their alleged involvement in receiving illegal gratification in the Adarsh Housing Society Scam. = Bail = On 29 May 2012, a special CBI court granted bail to seven of the nine arrested accused in the Adarsh scam since the CBI failed to file a chargesheet within the stipulated 60 days from the time it took them in custody. Those granted bail include Maj. Gen. (Retired-retd) A. R. Kumar, Maj. Gen. (retd) T. K. Kaul, Brig. (retd) M. M. Wanchu, IAS officer and former Mumbai district collector Pradeep Vyas, former Defence Estate officer R. C. Thakur, IAS officer P. V. Deshmukh and former Congress member of the Legislative Council Kanhaiyalal Gidwani (the chief promoter of Adarsh). The bail was set at ₹500,000 rupees (US$7,700). They have been directed to attend the CBI office every Tuesday and Thursday between 10 am and 12 pm. The court also told the accused to deposit their passports and not tamper with evidence. =Role of Maharashtra Governor K Sankaranarayanan= In spite of CBI having a strong 'quid pro quo' case against ex Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan, Maharashtra Governor K. Sankaranarayanan refused to grant permission to prosecute Chavan. Case Time Lines Jan 2014: Sessions court refuses to delete Ashok Chavan's name as accused in the case on request made by CBI. Mar 2015: Bombay High Court also dismisses Ashok Chavan's petition seeking deletion of his name from the case. Oct 2015: CBI submits fresh evidence to Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao seeking sanction once again. Feb 2016: Governor Rao grants the CBI permission to prosecute Ashok Chavan. Chavan approaches HC challenging Governor's order. Dec 22, 2017: HC allows Chavan’s petition and quashes and sets aside Governor’s order granting sanction to prosecute him.  Inquiry by a Judicial Commission  On 9 January 2011, Government of Maharashtra appointed a two- member judicial commission, under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, to investigate alleged irregularities and corruption. It was decided that the commission would be led by a retired Bombay High Court judge JA Patil while former State Chief Secretary P Subramanian would be the member. The Commission's terms of reference were to investigate all aspects, including land ownership and allotment, permissions given to Adarsh. The Commission was given three months' time to complete the investigation. On 27 June 2012, while deposing before the two-member panel probing the scam, Vilasrao Deshmukh, Union Minister and former chief minister of Maharashtra contended that land was allotted to the housing society after getting clearance from the Revenue Department, passing the buck to his successor, Ashok Chavan who headed the department then. = Report and role of Maharashtra state cabinet led by Prithviraj Chavan= In April 2013, the commission submitted its final report to the Government of Maharashtra but it refused to table it in the assembly. The Government of Maharashtra deliberately adopted delay tactics and it was only after queries from the Bombay High Court that the Government tabled the report purposely on the very last day of Assembly's Winter Session in December 2013 so that the Adarsh report cannot be discussed in the Winter session of 2013. The report that was tabled was conveniently rejected the Maharashtra Cabinet led by Prithviraj Chavan. The report indicted 4 former chief ministers: Ashok Chavan, Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushilkumar Shinde and Shivajirao Nilangekar Patil, 2 former urban development ministers: Rajesh Tope and Sunil Tatkare and 12 top bureaucrats. The report said Ashok Chavan and other bureaucrats gave permissions and clearances in exchange for flats. It found 25 of the society's 102 members ineligible. The report also said Adarsh enjoyed the \\"political patronage\\" of Late Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushil Kumar Shinde, Chavan, Sunil Tatkare and Rajesh Tope. The report revealed that 22 benami transactions took place and that the Adarsh society never sought any environmental clearances. The report mentioned that Devyani Khobragade (who was in the news for a visa fraud allegation by United States Government around the same time the report was released), was an illegal beneficiary of a flat allotted to her. After Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi publicly disapproved of Maharashtra cabinet's decision to reject judicial report, Prithviraj Chavan convened a cabinet meet to review the decision. The report was partially accepted by the state cabinet. It was decided that the 12 officials named in the report will face departmental inquiry for violating the service conduct rules but appeared going soft on politicians named by the commission for political patronage. The cabinet has also decided to initiate proceedings against 22 benami transactions, adding the commission had recommended action against allottees of such flats as they were found to be in violation of the Benami Transactions Prohibition Act. CBI special court rejects CBI plea K. Sankaranarayanan, Governor of Maharashtra (2010-2014) in 2013 rejected the proposal of Central Bureau of Investigations to grant sanction to prosecute former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan for having favoured Adarsh Society by way of allotment of additional Floor Space Index illegally. It is stated in the C.B.I. proposal that Mr. Chavan grabbed two apartments in the tainted society for these illegal decisions. Acitivist Ketan Tirodkar moved Bombay High Court seeking direction to C.B.I. to proceed against Ashok Chavan without sanction on the basis of Supreme Court Judgement stating that sanction to prosecute is not required in cases that are monitored by Court.[Application 27 of 2013 in Cr.PIL 34 of 2010]. The application states that Governor Mr. Sankarnarayan was Union Minister with father of Ashok Chavan and Ashok met governor on later's birth-day 15 October; 2013; at Raj Bhavan; official residence of the Governor. This meet lasted for an hour; as stated in the application after which Governor rejected the CBI plea of sanction. The application in High Court seeks direction to CBI to proceed with prosecution of Ashok Chavan & Governor. CBI, acting like a caged parrot, conveniently ignored the Supreme Court judgement on the aspect of Sanction to Prosecute being Not Required in cases monitored by Court; and moved the Special CBI court to drop Mr. Ashok Chavan from the process of prosecution. However the special court rejected the CBI's plea to drop his name from the list of accused in the Adarsh scam case. Special CBI court observed even though governor K Sankaranarayanan had rejected CBI's plea for sanction to prosecute Chavan, he could still be tried under the Prevention of Corruption act as he has been accused of criminal misconduct. Special CBI Public Prosecutor Bharat Badami himself admitted in the court that the CBI would be \\"very happy\\" to prosecute the former chief minister but \\"our hands are tied\\". Another Public Interest Litigation has been moved by activist Ketan Tirodkar seeking to prosecute State Cabinet for having rejected Judicial Commission findings pertaining to Adarsh housing scam..  Issues  Adarsh Housing Society has defended its actions as similar to other housing societies such as Samata, Nyay Sagar & likes in which \\"serving and retired judges already owned homes in Mumbai but transferred these in names of their children to become eligible for apartments in Samata & Nyay Sagar.\\"Adarsh has a defence, there are so many like us - Indian Express Also, Nyay Sagar Society is constructed upon a plot of land reserved for Housing the War Disabled. Events since 2014 In 2014, when the BJP led NDA formed the government of Maharashtra, the case against Ashok Chavan was reopened. However, Chavan appealed and the Bombay High court rejected the reopening of the case. In 2016, the same court ordered the building to be demolished holding that it was illegally constructed. However, the society appealed to the Supreme court of India which in 2018 ordered a stay on the demolition. On the orders of the Supreme Court, the Indian army has secured the building pending further appeals.

Before the botnet was eventually dismantled in November 2010 through the seizure of its command and control servers, it was estimated to consist of millions of zombie computers.  Operations  Though the earliest reports surrounding the Bredolab botnet originate from May 2009 (when the first malware samples of the Bredolab trojan horse were found) the botnet itself did not rise to prominence until August 2009, when there was a major surge in the size of the botnet. Bredonet's main form of propagation was through sending malicious e-mails that included malware attachments which would infect a computer when opened, effectively turning the computer into another zombie controlled by the botnet. At its peak, the botnet was capable of sending 3.6 billion infected emails every day. The other main form of propagation was through the use of drive-by downloads - a method which exploits security vulnerabilities in software. This method allowed the botnet to bypass software protection in order to facilitate downloads without the user being aware of them. The main income of the botnet was generated through leasing parts of the botnet to third parties who could subsequently use these infected systems for their own purposes, and security researchers estimate that the owner of the botnet made up to $139,000 a month from botnet related activities.Bredolab Down but Far from Out After Botnet Takedown, 28 October 2010 Due to the rental business strategy, the payload of Bredolab has been very diverse, and ranged from scareware to malware and e-mail spam. = Dismantling and aftermath = On 25 October 2010, a team of Dutch law enforcement agents seized control of 143 servers which contained three command & control servers, one database server and several management servers from the Bredolab botnet in a datacenter from LeaseWeb, effectively removing the botnet herder's ability to control the botnet centrally. In an attempt to regain control of his botnet, the botnet herder utilized 220,000 computers which were still under his control, to unleash a DDoS attack on LeaseWeb servers, though these attempts were ultimately in vain. After taking control of the botnet, the law enforcement team utilized the botnet itself to send a message to owners of infected computers, stating that their computer was part of the botnet.Undead Bredolab zombie network lashes out from the grave, 29 October 2010 Subsequently, Armenian law enforcement officers arrested an Armenian citizen, Georgy Avanesov, on the basis of being the suspected mastermind behind the botnet. The suspect denied any such involvement in the botnet. He was sentenced to four years in prison in May 2012. While the seizure of the command and control servers severely disrupted the botnet's ability to operate, the botnet itself is still partially intact, with command and control servers persisting in Russia and Kazakhstan. Security firm FireEye believes that a secondary group of botnet herders has taken over the remaining part of the botnet for their own purposes, possibly a previous client who reverse engineered parts of the original botnet creator's code. Even so, the group noted that the botnet's size and capacity has been severely reduced by the law enforcement intervention.

Childhood years and youth  Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was born in Kasımpaşa, a poor neighborhood of Istanbul. His family was originally from Rize, a conservative town on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, and returned there when Erdoğan was still an infant, coming back to Istanbul again when he was 13. He spent those years attending Istanbul İmam Hatip school and selling lemonade and simit (sesame rings) on the city's streets to make extra bills. While studying business administration at what is today Marmara University's Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences and playing semi-professional football, Erdoğan also engaged in politics by joining the National Turkish Student Union, an anti- communist action group. In 1976, he became the head of a local youth branch of the Islamist National Salvation Party (MSP), led by Necmettin Erbakan, who would later go on to found the Felicity Party. This was the beginning of Erdoğan's long career in politics.  Mayor of Istanbul  After the 1980 coup, Erbakan's movement regrouped under the Welfare Party (RP), and Erdoğan gradually became one of its stars. In 1991, Erdoğan became a candidate for Parliament on the party's ticket and won a seat, only to be kept from taking it on a technicality. In 1994, Erdoğan was elected Mayor of Istanbul to the shock of the city's more secular citizens, who thought he would ban alcohol and impose Islamic law. Instead, he emerged over the next four years as a pragmatic mayor who tackled many chronic problems in the city, including pollution, water shortages and traffic. Meanwhile, the political environment was growing tense in Turkey, as the Welfare Party came to power in June 1996 in a coalition government with the center-right True Path Party (DYP). RP head Necmettin Erbakan, who became Turkey's first openly Islamist prime minister, conflicted with the principle of the separation of religion and state in Turkey with his radical rhetoric. Six months later, in February 1997, the military initiated what was later dubbed the \\"post-modern coup\\". Soon, Erbakan was ousted from power and many Islamist groups were the subject of a crackdown as part of a series of court cases opened by prosecutors. Erdoğan was caught up in this crackdown in 1997, when he made a public speech in the southeastern province of Siirt denouncing the closure of his party and recited these lines of a poem from the Turkish War of Liberation: \\"The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers.\\" A court held that this speech was an attack on the government and Islamist rhetoric, and sentenced Erdoğan in September 1998 to a 10-month prison term, of which he served four months. He was also banned from holding political office for life. \\"Erdoğan's political career is over,\\" some mainstream newspapers wrote at the time. \\"From now on, he can't even be a local governor.\\"  Between 1999 and 2001  Abdullah Gül, 2011 In the aftermath of the post-modern coup, Erdoğan came to believe that a new political line, different from Erbakan's anti-Western demagoguery, was needed. This was something he hinted at in the Siirt speech that netted him a prison term. As part of that speech, Erdoğan also said: \\"The Western man has freedom of belief; in Europe, there is respect for worship, for the headscarf. Why is there not in Turkey?\\" This Western-oriented line would be the new vision of Erdoğan and the more open-minded members of the Erbakan movement, such as Abdullah Gül. In their vision, authoritarian secularism in Turkey should not be considered an extension of the West, as religious conservatives had done for decades. The West should rather be seen as a way to create a more liberal Turkey that would respect religious liberty as well. Erdoğan had personal reasons to make that choice: He could thus send his veiled daughters, Esra and Sümeyye, not to Turkish universities, where there is a headscarf ban, but to American ones, where the coverings can be worn. Erdoğan and his colleagues thus put European Union membership, and EU-promoted political reforms, at the top of their agenda – at the expense of being accused of \\"treason\\" by their old comrades who stayed loyal to Erbakan.  The birth of the AKP  In 2001, Erdoğan and Gül established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The party chose as its emblem a modern light bulb, and Erdoğan asserted that the AKP was \\"not a political party with a religious axis\\", but rather one that could be defined as a mainstream conservative party. Its message concentrated on political liberalization and economic growth gave the party a sweeping victory in the general elections of November 2002. Even though his party won the elections, Erdoğan could not become prime minister right away, as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt, and Gül thus became the prime minister instead. In December 2002 the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for February 9, 2003. By this time, party leader Erdoğan was able to run for Parliament thanks to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and its leader, Deniz Baykal. The AKP listed Erdoğan as a candidate for the rescheduled Siirt election, and he won, becoming prime minister after Gül subsequently handed over the post.

A place of strategic military significance, Luxembourg had been fortified since the 10th century by over of walls and towers. Ruled by the House of Luxembourg in the early medieval period, Luxembourg was subsequently invaded by the Bourbons, Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, and the French, among others.  19th Century  After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Luxembourg was disputed between Prussia and the Netherlands. The Belgian Revolution of 1830–1839 reduced Luxembourg's territory by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to Belgium. Luxembourg's independence was reaffirmed by the 1839 First Treaty of London and again by the 1867 Second Treaty of London, after the Luxembourg Crisis nearly led to war between Prussia and France. The King of the Netherlands remained Head of State as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, maintaining personal union between the two countries until 1890. At the death of William III, the Dutch throne passed to his daughter Wilhelmina, while Luxembourg (at that time restricted to male heirs by the Nassau Family Pact) passed to Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg.Kreins (2003), p. 84 Soldiers from Luxembourg training in an English town during World War II.  World War II  During World War II, Luxembourg abandoned its policy of neutrality, when it joined the Allies in fighting Nazi Germany. It was again invaded and subject to German occupation in the Second World War in 1940, and was formally annexed into the Third Reich in 1942. Its government, exiled to London, set up a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion. It became a founding member of the United Nations in 1946, and of NATO in 1949. The contribution Luxembourg makes to its defence and to NATO consists of a small army (currently consisting of around 800 people). As a landlocked country, it has no navy.  Korean War  During the Korean War, Luxembourg contributed a 44-man contingent, attached to the Belgian contingent, to the United Nations force. Luxembourg achieved the dual distinction of deploying the largest proportion of its military force (10%) amongst all states contributing to the United Nations forces, and suffering the highest proportion of casualty (more than one third) amongst all United Nations contingents.  Currently  Luxembourg also lacks an air force, though the seventeen NATO AWACS aeroplanes are for convenience registered as aircraft of Luxembourg. In accordance with a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one A400M military cargo plane, currently on order. Luxembourg still jointly maintains three NATO Boeing 707 model TCAs (for cargo and training purposes) based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen.

In Stoker's narrative, Castle Dracula is the single most important location. The first and the last part of the plot take place here. The inaccessible stronghold, which initially symbolises the vampire's power, finally becomes the scene of his extermination. The novel's events taking place in or near the castle In the novel's first chapters, the young English solicitor Jonathan Harker, travelling from London via Paris, Munich, Vienna, Budapest, Klausenburg and Bistritz, arrives at the castle after being picked up in the Borgo Pass by a mysterious driver, whom Harker later recognises as his host, Count Dracula, himself. During the trip, he apparently falls asleep, but wakes up when the calèche reaches the stronghold. The driver disappears and Harker thinks himself lost, until the door opens and the Count bids him welcome. After some tasty meals, which Harker always enjoys alone, and various conversations about the property Carfax near Purfleet, which his host wishes to purchase, Harker discovers that his patron has some disturbing habits, like climbing down the walls of the building like a lizard. Harker finds himself a prisoner in the castle. One night, when he falls asleep in a forbidden room, he is harassed by the three vampire sisters, who are interrupted by a furious Count, claiming the guest for himself. Apart from the scene with the female vampires however, who provoke a strange desire in him to be kissed by those red lips, Harker is not attacked in any way. The Count induces him to stay for a much longer time than planned and write some letters home (predated 12 June 19 and 29 June), to appease his employer and his fiancée Mina Murray. Harker scales the walls of the castle himself, enters the Count's empty room and discovers a crypt in the chapel, wherein fifty boxes with earth are stored; in one of them he finds the Count, who has just fed on blood. Harker tries to hit him with a shovel, but the blow is diverted by the Count's hypnotic powers. In this box, the Count is later transported, to be shipped to England later on. Harker remains in the castle with the seductive female vampires, but finally manages to escape to Budapest, where he is taken care of by Sister Agatha. All events are recorded in Harker's journal, which later serves his friends as a report about the vampire and as a travel guide. After Lucy Westenra, Mina Murray's old school friend, has died from a mysterious illness, Professor Abraham Van Helsing visits Mina and reads the diary, which he confirms to be a realistic account of the unbelievable circumstances Jonathan was confronted with. In the final chapters, the vampire hunters chase the Count, who returns to his homeland by ship. Dracula tricks them by directing the vessel to Galatz, while Van Helsing and his friends are waiting for the Czarina Catherine to show up in Varna. In Galatz, the party splits in three couplings: Van Helsing and Mina travel by train to Veresți near Suceava and continue with a purchased horse carriage over Bukovinian territory to the east end of the Borgo Pass; Jonathan Harker and Arthur Holmwood buy a steam launch to follow the Count's box, transported by Slovak boatmen via the Sereth and the Bistrița River, while Dr. John Seward and Quincey Morris head in the same direction by horse. The box with the Count is taken over from the Slovaks by Szgany (Gypsies), who transport it by leiter wagon. The routes of the Szgany and the three couplings finally converge at a place in the immediate neighbourhood of the castle, where Van Helsing and his men force the convoy to stop. Harker manages to decapitate the vampire with his Kukri knife, while Morris plunges his Bowie knife into the heart. The only person to actually enter the castle during this episode is Prof. Abraham van Helsing, who leaves the night camp shared with Mina to do away with the vampire sisters. Mina is already affected by her \\"blood wedding\\" with the vampire and left within a circle of Holy Bread. In a final note, written seven years after their dramatic adventures, Harker reports on the group's return to Transylvania: Physical characteristics and lay-out of the castle The first description is given by Jonathan Harker when the calèche reaches the courtyard of the castle: The ruined state of the castle is confirmed by the Count's words: The interior decoration, on the other hand, is still in good shape and the library is well equipped: Harker's window opens into the courtyard, but soon he sets out for a little expedition: All other doors are locked, however. The Count warns him not to sleep outside the rooms he already knows, including the library and the dining room; it seems as if the castle has a life of its own: When Harker finds another open door, though, he ignores this warning and falls asleep in the forbidden chambers: In this room, indeed, the ladies of the castle pay him their tantalising visit. The Count's room is also one storey below Harker's own room; from there, a circular staircase and a tunnel lead to the chapel with the boxes: When Van Helsing comes to Castle Dracula, he goes directly to the ruined chapel and finds Dracula's \\"brides\\" in three of the tombs there, as well as Dracula's own tomb, which is empty. Sources of inspiration Castle at Törzburg, ill. from Charles Boner Bram Stoker's hand- written notes for Dracula identifies a setting for a castle early on (about 1890). At this stage no specific castle had been identified as inspiration. Having taken Transylvania as the location for Castle Dracula, it's possible that he copied information about a castle at Vécs from one of his sources on Transylvania, the book by Major E.C. Johnson.Major E.C. Johnson, On the Track of the Crescent: Erratic Notes from the Piraeus to Pesth. London: Hurst and Blackett, 1885. p. 256-257, quoted by Marius Crișan, The Models for Castle Dracula in Stoker’s Sources on Transylvania, Journal of Dracula Studies Nr 10 (2008); also referred to by Miller, 2006, p. 141 A further option is that Stoker saw an illustration of Castle Bran (Törzburg) in the book on Transylvania by Charles Boner, or read about it in the books by Mazuchelli or Crosse.Charles Boner, Transylvania: Its Products and Its People. London: Longmans, 1865. Referred to by Marius Crișan, The Models for Castle Dracula in Stoker’s Sources on Transylvania, Journal of Dracula Studies Nr 10 (2008). As indicated by Crişan, Crosse's book. Round About the Carpathians and Mazuchelli's Magyarland describe Törzburg as well. In 1893 Bram Stoker discovered Cruden Bay in Scotland, which became the regular spot for his monthly summer holiday, largely devoted to writing. Parts, if not most, of Dracula were written there. Nearby Slains Castle appears to have inspired part of the floor plan for Castle Dracula, in particular the octagonal room: ‘The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.’ Compare this with the description of Slains Castle from a 1922 sales document: ‘On the Principle Floor: Entrance Hall (heated with stove) leading to Central Octagonal Interior Hall (heated with stove and lighted from above).’ The location of the castle The site of the Vampire's home has always been one of the greatest mysteries of the novel. The route descriptions hardly mention any recognisable landmarks, but focus on evocations of a wild and snow-covered landscape, haunted by howling wolves and lit by supernatural blue flames at night. Because of this conspicuous vagueness, the annotated Dracula editions by Leonard Wolf,Leonard Wolf, The Essential Dracula, New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 1975, followed by The Essential Dracula: The Definitive Annotated Edition, Penguin, 1993 Clive LeatherdaleClive Leatherdale, Dracula Unearthed, Westcliff-on-Sea, UK: Desert Island Books, 1998 and Leslie KlingerLeslie Klinger, The New Annotated Dracula, W. W. Norton & Company, 2008 simply assume Bram Stoker had no specific location in mind and place the castle in or immediately next to the Borgo Pass. As a consequence, these editions take for granted that the Count's men, pursued by Harker, Holmwood, Morris and Seward, follow the Bistrița River all the way up to Vatra Dornei and then travel the route through the Borgo Pass already taken by Van Helsing and Mina. The same view is adopted by Andrew Connell in his Google Map mark-ups.See http://infocult.typepad.com/dracula These theories ignore or misinterpret Stoker's hint that around the 47th Parallel, the Count's men are supposed to leave the river and cross-over to Transylvanian territory: Only recently, the Dutch author Hans Corneel de Roos discovered the site the Irish novelist really had in mind while shaping his narrative: an empty mountain top in the Transylvanian Călimani Mountains near the former border with Moldavia, ca. 20 miles south-east of the Borgo Pass.Hans Corneel de Roos, The Dracula Maps, in: The Ultimate Dracula, Moonlake Editions, Munich, 2012. De Roos also explains why Stoker chose to obscure this location in his novel and compares the vampire's fortress to the Grail Castle as its anti-Christian antipole: It cannot be found on purpose, only by guidance. Harker is brought there by the Count himself, while Van Helsing and Mina – equally nodding off – rely on the instinct of their horses and the mounted men arrive there by following the Gypsies. Deleted paragraphs picturing the destruction of Castle Dracula Three paragraphs from the original manuscript, in which the building itself is swallowed by a volcanic cataclysm, do not appear in the printed version. Possible reasons mentioned are that Stoker wanted to leave the option of a sequel open, or that this dramatic finale reminded too much of Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\": In his annotated Dracula edition, Leslie Klinger suggests as part of his conceit in considering Dracula a collection of true documents that these lines were part of Count Dracula's efforts to \\"cover up\\" the truth about the vampire's continuing activities, but that Stoker sabotaged the Count's editorial intervention by deleting these lines.Leslie Klinger, The New Annotated Dracula, W.W. Norton & Co., 2008. p. 499f., footnote 53. Castle Dracula as a tourist attraction Since 1997, the Bran Castle in Bran (Törzburg) near Brașov has been marketed as \\"Dracula's Castle\\".See www.draculascastle.com/ The website promoting it claims it was one of Vlad the Impaler's temporary residences. Since Van Helsing and Mina in Chapter 25 do not identify Count Dracula as the historical Vlad III Dracula (Vlad Țepeş or Vlad the Impaler) but as a nameless \\"other of [the Dracula] race\\", living \\"in a later age\\", this claim – true or not – does not support the identification of Stoker's fictitious building with the Bran Castle.Hans Corneel de Roos, Bram Stoker's Vampire Trap: Vlad the Impaler and his nameless Double, in: The Ultimate Dracula, Moonlake Editions, Munich, 2012. However, in Chapter 18, Van Helsing confirms Dracula and Vlad are one and the same: \\"He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land.\\" For the same reason, the Poenari Castle in Argeș County does not qualify as the \\"real\\" Dracula Castle; Stoker never heard of the Poenari fortress. Both the Bran Castle and the Poenari Castle are more than 100 miles away from the site Stoker actually selected and took down in a cryptic handwritten note. The Hotel Castel Dracula, located in Piâtra Fântânele in the Borgo Pass, which promotes itself as being constructed at the place of Stoker's Castle, at least is located at the point where Harker left the post carriage from Bistritz to Bukovina to be picked up by the Count; their route must have led over the former watchpost of Dornișoara towards the Călimani Mountains peaks in the south-east. Castle Dracula in popular culture Because of its outstanding role in one of the best-known works of fiction of all time, Castle Dracula appears in numerous movies like Blood of Dracula's Castle (1969) (with John Carradine as the butler and Alexander D'Arcy as Count Dracula) and other Dracula-based films. There are video games called Dracula's Castle (Game Pac Adventure), Escape Dracula's Castle (Fun Flash Games),Restore Dracula's Castle and Demon Castle Dracula (Akumajō Dracula); the latter is best known to the west as Castlevania. A prosecco produced by a descendant of the Bassarab dynasty bears the name Castle of Dracula. Notes and references Bibliography * Boner, Charles. Transylvania: Its Product and Its People.

Career  = Zon-o- phone = According to Gracyk, after having been with Columbia, King joined Zon-o-phone in 1905 and, in 1907, became musical director of performances. He was also a Zon-o-phone A&R; manager. = Victor = Gracyk says that King \\"began to work regularly in Victor's New York studio after Victor stopped the operation of its Zon-o-phone subsidiary in 1912.\\" As early as 1911, Victor used the name \\"King's Orchestra\\" for one of its house orchestras.*Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings (University of California, Santa Barbara) From ca 1915 to ca 1920 King was manager of Victor's Foreign Department, the unit responsible for making the recordings for the foreign and ethnic groups in the United States, excluding recordings made by the Race, Hillbilly, and Export (to Central and South America) Departments. King's Orchestra was the primary house orchestra for making foreign recordings during this period. For the majority of the orchestra's foreign department recordings, King's Orchestra served as the accompanying orchestra for Victor's foreign vocal and instrumental artists. About mid-1915, King hired Nathaniel Shilkret to work for him as conductor and arranger at Victor, and Shilkret replaced King as manager of the Foreign Department when King was promoted to Director of Light Music. King was also a member of Victor's A&R; committee. In his autobiography, Shilkret lists the Victor Talking Machine A&R; committee as consisting of Harry MacDonough (chairman), Eddie King, Shilkret, R. P. Wielage, Porter, and Davis. Shilkret cites King as the A&R; man responsible for bringing Kate Smith to Victor. As Director of Light Music King was well known as an authoritarian who would not any permit departure from the written music. This was a source of irritation to many of the popular Victor recording artists of the time. SudhalterSudhalter, Richard, Lost Chords: White Musicians and Their Contribution to Jazz, 1915--1945, Oxford, New York, 1999, p. 313. cites an example of a 1927 recording by the Goldkette Orchestra in which musicians were allowed considerable freedom, and remarks \\"What, one wonders, would this performance have been if Eddie King had been in charge, and not the more liberal Nat Shilkret.\\" Since the Victor ledgers show no less than five recording sessions in January and February 1926, when King actually conducted Goldkette’s Orchestra, comparison between the approach of Goldkette and King is readily available.Victor Recording Book log, pp. 5245, 5247, 5215, 5257, 5259, 5262, 5322, and 5328. King also conducted many other dance orchestras, such as those of Paul Whiteman, Ted Weems and Irving Aaronson. King went to cities such as Chicago, Oakland, and New Orleans when Victor began recording in these cities. = Columbia = King left Victor in October 1926 to go back to Columbia, and again his replacement, this time as Victor's Director of Light Music, was Shilkret.  Legacy  King was one of a group of five that constituted, by a large margin, Victor's most prolific recording artists. EDVR shows over 2000 entries for King. (The other most prolific Victor Talking Machine recording musicians were Nathaniel Shilkret and Rosario Bourdon, each of whom have well over 3000 entries in EDVR, and Walter B. Rogers and Josef Pasternack, each with around 2000 entries in EDVR.)

Located in the historic Back Bay of Boston, Massachusetts at 44 Commonwealth Avenue, the College Club was established by nineteen college educated women whose mission was to form a social club where they and other like-minded women could meet and share companionship. The College Club of Boston the oldest residential college club in the United States. History In December 1890, 76 Marlborough Street, also located in Boston's Back Bay, became the first home of The College Club. The building at 76 Marlborough was purchased by Club member Mabel Cummings in 1893. The Club was designed by Mary Almy. In April 1905, the College Club acquired the clubhouse at 40 Commonwealth Avenue, which contained an Old English drawing room, a fine big cafe with a male chef, and seven bedrooms, each of which \\"were furnished and decorated in the colors of various women's colleges: crimson rambler wallpaper for Radcliffe, blue silk curtains for Wellesley, white (with brass beds) for Smith, dawn pink and gray for Vassar.\\" At that time, the College Club served 600 members, which grew to 1,243 members by 1915. In 1924 the Club purchased 44 Commonwealth Avenue, which was the family home of Royal E. Robbins, a major stockholder in the Waltham Watch Company, and once the home of American stage actress Maude Adams. The brownstone townhouse was built in 1864 and was designed in the High Victorian style. From its earliest days, The College Club was host to literary luminaries such as Mark Twain, Vladimir Nabokov, poet Oliver Wendell Holmes, and novelist F. Marion Crawford. Other well-known visitors to the Club have included actress Sarah Bernhardt, Dr. David Zelaya, social activist Julia Ward Howe, abolitionist and suffragist Lucy Stone, health care advocate Judy Norsigian and Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Club members took up the cause of educational philanthropy in 1985 and established The College Club Scholarship Fund, Inc. as an IRS 501(c)(3) designated charitable organization. The endowed fund is administered by Club members. Each year since 1986, the Scholarship Fund has awarded college tuition assistance to deserving high school seniors from Boston Public Schools. On May 20, 2002, the City of Boston certified the club's status as the oldest (i.e., first) women's college club in the United States.

Early editions are illustrated by Tony Ross and later by Anthony Lewis. The original series is narrated in first person by a nine-year- old Amber Brown, starting near the end of her third grade and through the summer after her fourth grade while turning ten. Danziger's balance of humor and personal tribulations are masterfully balanced to reach readers on a deep level throughout the series. Amber Brown is Not a Crayon begins the series some time after her mother and father have separated. While Amber's mother now dates Max, Amber's father pursues a new job in Paris. As if divorce and geographical separation from one parent isn't enough for a third grader to handle, Amber's lifelong best friend, Justin Daniels, finds out that he is moving to Alabama. This hurtful separation and the tribulations of getting caught in the middle of divorced parents set the foundation for the remainder of the series. A series of picture books for young readers titled A is for Amber was also published by Danziger with illustrations by Ross and featured adventures with Amber and Justin before Justin moved away and before Amber's parents divorced but after they are already regularly arguing. Audiobook releases of installments in the series are available, published by Live Oak Media and read by Dana Lubotsky. The recordings of the A is for Amber series feature original music and sound effects. The series was originally inspired by Danziger's real-life niece, Carrie Danziger, shortly after both of her best friends moved away in the same summer. While Amber was a creative conglomeration of Paula Danziger's design, aspects of Carrie's life were used throughout the series. The second title, \\"You Can't Eat Your Chicken Pox Amber Brown\\" was inspired by the Danziger girls going to England together and Carrie getting chicken pox her first night in England. Ross also used Carrie as the model for the original illustration of Amber. The series originally ended in 2004 with the death of the author Paula Danziger. In 2012, a new title in the series, Amber Brown is Tickled Pink, was announced. Written by popular children's authors Bruce Coville and Elizabeth Levy, whom Danziger described as her best friend and her other best friend, the new title was released on September 13, 2012. Tony Ross returns as the illustrator for this installment. Two additional titles were released 2013 and 2014. The second new title, Amber Brown is On the Move, was released on September 12, 2013 and Amber Brown is Horsing Around is due out in 2014. Anthony Lewis relieves Ross as the illustrator of these titles. The idea to revive the series originated with Danziger's agent, Amy Berkower.

The film depicts the events following DJ and producer Ickarus's (Paul Kalkbrenner) institutionalization for drug abuse. Plot Berlin techno DJ and producer Martin Karow (nicknamed Ickarus) is touring the techno clubs of the world with his girlfriend Mathilde while working on a new studio album that he plans to release soon. In order to be able to work and party day and night, Ickarus takes all kinds of drugs, mainly supplied by his friend Erbse at the clubs in Berlin. After consuming a PMA-containing ecstasy tablet, Ickarus goes into a drug-induced psychosis, eventually finding himself naked in a Berlin hotel where his antics attract the attention of the hotel staff. He is taken to a psychiatric hospital in Berlin, which puts his album and upcoming live performances in danger. At the hospital, Ickarus gets to know the other patients, namely Crystal Pete and Goa Gebhard, and is slightly unnerved by their idiosyncrasies. The clinic's head doctor Dr. Paul recommends that Ickarus take a break from his music and touring to recover in the hospital under her care. She emphasizes that Ickarus's commitment to the hospital is purely voluntary. Although Ickarus agrees to stay at the hospital, he continues work on his album by having his laptop and recording equipment brought to the clinic. Ickarus leaves the clinic and relapses into drug use after visiting with Erbse. Alice, the head of the record label Vinyl Distortion (to which Ickarus is signed), tells Mathilde that the release of Ickarus's new album is indefinitely delayed. Upon hearing this, Ickarus visits Alice and destroys her office when she refuses to speak to him. Upset at Ickarus's lack of progress, Mathilde moves out of their apartment and in with her lesbian co-worker Corinna. After receiving a 25,000 Euro tax bill, Ickarus tries to visit Mathilde at Corinna's apartment, but she refuses to see him. Dr. Paul tells Ickarus that since he refuses to follow his therapy schedule and leaves the clinic without permission, he must leave the clinic. That night, after Dr. Paul has left, Ickarus convinces the clinic's intern to allow him to throw a going-away party. The party quickly gets out of hand when Ickarus brings drugs, alcohol, and prostitutes. Dr. Paul arrives at the clinic and locks Ickarus in a room. Ickarus's father (a priest who also appeared earlier in the film) and Mathilde argue with Dr. Paul for his release. She eventually relents. After his production label re-signs him, Ickarus proposes calling his new album Titten, Techno, und Trompeten (Tits, Techno, and Trumpets). Alice says that the record company prefers a more \\"international\\" title, and decides on the name Berlin Calling. The album cover photography is done in the clinic with Ickarus still dressed as a patient. Cast and characters As listed on the film's official website, the cast of Berlin Calling included: Soundtrack The soundtrack of Berlin Calling (which shares the film's title) was recorded exclusively by Paul Kalkbrenner, with the exception of the song \\"Mango\\", which was recorded by Sascha Funke.

MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by several mechanisms. mir-210 has been strongly linked with the hypoxia pathway, and is upregulated in response to Hypoxia-inducible factors. It is also overexpressed in cells affected by cardiac disease and tumours. MiRNA-210 in particular, has been studied for its effects in rescuing cardiac function after myocardial infarcts via the up-regulation of angiogenesis and inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Myocardial infarction therapy  Myocardial infarction is cardiac tissue necrosis that results from occlusion of blood supply via coronary arteries, thereby starving cells of oxygen and nutrients (termed ischemia). Prolong ischemia will eventually kill the cells and the destruction of cardiac cells leads to tissue death, which can lead to heart failure. Delivery of miRNA-210 to an ischemic heart improves heart function, possibly by promoting the release of angiogenic factors like interleukin-1α (IL-1α), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and leptin, as seen in HL-1 cardiomyocytes injected with miRNA-210. However, miRNA-210 also targets the Efna3 and Ptp1b genes, which are genes which endogenously regulate angiogenesis and apoptosis, respectively. Ephrin-A3 (Efna3) is a gene that is involved in the inhibition of angiogenesis. Although it is known that Efna3 inhibits the formation of new blood vessels, its specific role is still unknown. MiRNA-210 suppresses Efna3 at the mRNA level, thereby allowing angiogenesis to occur in cardiac tissue post-infarct. The second target gene, protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (Ptp1b) is involved in the induction of apoptosis. Ptp1b gene protein has been known to regulate apoptosis by regulating the phosphorylation status of apoptotic proteins such as caspase-3 and caspase-8. MiRNA-210 inhibits the effects of Ptp1b protein, which suppresses its pro-apoptotic functions. Therefore, suppression of these two particular genes may contribute to the improvement of cardiac tissue and function by up-regulating angiogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis of cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarct.  Biomarker  = Adrenocortical carcinoma = Mir-210 has been suggested as a useful biomarker to distinguish adrenocortical carcinoma from adrenocortical adenoma. = Breast cancer = mir-210 expression is associated with survival in breast cancer.

He was known best for his research into the relationship between infrasound and ghostly apparitions.  Career  During 2001 Tandy was asked to investigate the cellar of Coventry's Tourist Information Centre and in 2004 he was part of a research group looking for paranormal activity in Warwick Castle. In both cases he found high levels of infrasound present. Tandy also conducted large- scaled experiments including one experiment on 750 participants at London's Royal Festival Hall. Tandy also wrote a computer column for the newspaper Coventry Telegraph, and on the use of computers in higher education. He was also an associate member of the Society for Psychical Research and a chartered engineer. Leamington and Warwick Magic Society Vic Tandy had an interest in traditional conjuring skills and tricks used by stage magicians. He believed this type of knowledge allowed him to detect hoaxes. He was at the time of his death a fully paid member of the Leamington and Warwick Magic Society.Leamington and Warwick Magic Society archives (bulletin no 57) Work with infrasound During the early 1980s Tandy was working in a research laboratory for a medical manufacturing company, when, in his own words: \\"I was sweating but cold, and the feeling of depression was noticeable – but there was also something else. It was as though something was in the room with me.\\" Tandy then claimed to have seen a spirit emerging in his peripheral vision, but when he turned to face the figure, it vanished. He discovered the cause of the \\"haunting\\" by accident. The next day Tandy, a keen fencer, was polishing his sword when he noticed that the blade was vibrating even when clamped in a vice. From this Tandy developed the idea that infrasound might be present in the laboratory. Further experimentation showed that the infrasound trapped in the laboratory was at its highest next to Tandy's desk, right where he had seen the ghost. The infrasound was found to have come from a newly installed extractor fan. Tandy went on to recreate his experience, and with the assistance of Dr. Tony Lawrence, he was able to publish his findings in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.. Their research led them to conclude that infrasound at or around a frequency of 19 Hz, has a range of physiological effects, including feelings of fear and shivering. Though this had been known for many years, Tandy and Lawrence were the first people to link it to ghostly sightings. Tandy also appeared in the \\"Ghosts on the London Underground\\" documentary.  Death  Tandy died in July 2005, at the age of 50. He was survived by his wife and an adult son.

The district has over 300 buildings, a few dating back to the early eighteenth century. It includes 28 acres, which is the area of the original town as laid out in 1697 and is bounded by the Delaware River, and Lincoln, Pond, Cedar, and Mill Streets. Most of the buildings are residential and only 22 are considered to be non- historic intrusions to the district.Bristol Historic District, Delaware and Lehigh National Historic Corridor, A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary, National Park ServicePatrick W. O'Bannon, 1986, [ NRHP Nomination Form - Bristol Historic District] History Samuel Sloan. Bristol's first European settler, Samuel Clift, operated a ferry across the Delaware River starting in 1681. A Quaker settlement soon grew near the ferry, and in 1697 residents petitioned the Provincial Council to establish the community as the third town in the Pennsylvania Colony. The Bristol Friends Meetinghouse, built in 1711-1714 and partially reconstructed in 1728, is still standing and represents this era of the town's history. Many other buildings burned down in the fire of 1724.Bristol Friends Meeting accessed 2010-11-04. During the last half of the 18th century the town was an important station on the New York to Philadelphia stagecoach route. The Delaware Hotel, at Radcliffe and Mill Street, was originally built in 1765 but has been added to many times since. The 1781 Thomas Belford residence at 200 Mill Street, later turned into a drug store, also represents this era. From the 1780s to the 1820s Bath Springs, just north of the original town, became a famous spa and large residences were built by wealthy Philadelphians and New Yorkers. Shipbuilding was also an important industry. In 1832 the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal was completed with Bristol at its southern end, and the town became a transportation hub. Business boomed with hotels, wharves, docks and warehouses lining the riverfront. About 1855 the boom ended as the canal gained access to the Delaware River to the north at New Hope, allowing traffic to New York to bypass Bristol. Many of the houses in the 300 block of Radcliffe Street were built during this period. The 1851 First Baptist Church was designed by Thomas U. Walter. St. James Episcopal Church, designed by Samuel Sloan was completed in 1857. The Dorrance Mansion was completed during the Civil War. Following the Civil War to town's economy recovered as mills and factories were built along the canal, which provided both water power and transportation. Bristol became the largest center of industry in Bucks County and the town grew with both workers housing and the mansions of industrialists.

Though it is currently unknown if Dinocrocuta was solitary or social, it was probably an able hunter of such animals as the tusked rhinoceros Chilotherium. Chilotherium, despite its great size, was vulnerable to the giant feliform, particularly when it was giving birth, or was injured or sick. A skull and jaw from a female Chilotherium bears the distinctive bite marks on the forehead from a Dinocrocuta teeth, indicating that the rhino was part of the carnivore's diet. The regrowth of bone on the rhino's injuries also indicate that the Dinocrocuta attempt at predation failed and that the rhinoceros fought off her attacker, managing to escape and heal.http://www.eartharchives.org/articles/rhino-versus-hyena- skull-biting-in-extinct-predators/ References Category:Miocene feliforms Category:Hyenas Category:Neogene animals of Asia Category:Neogene animals of Africa Category:Fossil taxa described in 1975 ","title":"Dinocrocuta"},{"id":"29475470","text":"Conchobar ua nDiarmata, Noble of Connacht and foster-son to Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, died 1189.

Guttman (born January 17, 1951) is an American management consultant and founder of Guttman Development Strategies, a consulting firm. Guttman is best known for his theories on corporate organizational hierarchies, positing that the traditional, top-down model of management is less effective than the horizontal, high-performance organization, where decisions are made by cross- functional teams with equal authority. Guttman’s theories have garnered him a following in top-management circles, largely due to his books and work with leaders of multi-national corporations who have applied his ideas in day-to- day business operations. He also regularly addresses corporate and academic audiences.  Professional career  After graduating from New Jersey’s Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1972 with a degree in history and education, Howard M. Guttman joined the New Jersey Historical Society as an associate in education, responsible for developing programs on New Jersey history and culture for teachers and students. After three years, he decided to matriculate in the master’s program at Case Western Reserve’s Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences. He received his M.S., with a focus on organization and community development, and returned to the New Jersey Historical Society as assistant director, responsible for State planning and Federal grant development. During his tenure at the society, Guttman authored 35 articles on New Jersey history. He also consulted with various organizations in the greater-New Jersey metropolitan area on issues related to management and organization development. Guttman’s interest in organization development consulting led him to apply for a position at Automatic Data Processing (ADP). He joined the company as a management development specialist. At ADP, he deepened his knowledge of the fundamentals of organization development consulting. He was profoundly influenced by his mentor, Vice President of Human Resources Bernie Kessler, from whom he learned how an OD consultant can add significant value to an organization’s bottom line. He was promoted to senior OD consultant before leaving the company. In 1982, Guttman was hired as national manager of training and development for Johnson & Johnson's consumer products sector, where he continued to develop new organization development processes focusing on senior executive teams. When he left J&J; in 1988, he had risen to the position of corporate director of human resources. In 1989, Guttman founded Guttman Development Strategies (GDS) in his garage, based on his concept of horizontal, high-performance organizations, which was strongly influenced by the work of Peter Drucker. He now runs GDS out of a Mt. Arlington, N.J. office. GDS works with many senior executive teams, including that of Mars, Incorporated, which was the subject of a TIME magazine article.TIME magazine, February 9, 2009 Guttman’s work and ideas have led him to be named to Leadership Excellence magazine’s list of “Excellence 100 Top Thought Leaders”. Guttman’s writing and opinions are sought after by well- known publications and in a variety of forums. In 2004, he was asked to sit for an interview as part of Harvard Business Publishing’s “Results- Driven Manager” series. His article, “Are Your Global Team Members Miles Apart?” is included in Harvard Business Review's collection, \\"Managing Teams for High Performance.\\".Newsletter Collection: Managing Teams for High Performance, Harvard Business Publishing, 2007 Guttman also frequently addresses corporate and academic audiences, such as The Conference Board and The American Management Association. Guttman is the author of Great Business Teams: Cracking the Code for Standout Performance,John Wiley, 2008 named one of the Top Business Books of 2008 by Soundview Executive Book Summaries. He is also the author of When Goliaths Clash: Managing Executive Conflict to Build a More Dynamic Organization,AMACOM, 2003; Mt. Arlington Business Press 2008 named by Soundview as one of the Top Business Books of 2003. His third book, Coach Yourself to Win: 7 Steps to Breakthrough Performance on the Job and in Your Life,Mc-Graw-Hill, 2010 attempts to show individuals how they can apply Guttman’s executive coaching process to their everyday lives.  Basic ideas  Several core ideas run through Guttman's consulting and writings: = Horizontal, high-performance organizations = Howard Guttman argues that business organizations should abandon hierarchical models and move to what he terms the “horizontal, high-performance model.” In this model, decisions are made by teams composed of personnel from different functions within the organization. Guttman defines a high-performance team as a work-group that has reached agreement in five key areas: strategy; operational goals; roles and responsibilities; protocols, or ground rules; and business relationships/interdependencies. In such groups, there should be no leader per se; rather “every member of every team is a leader,” and each member holds the others accountable. = Executive coaching = Guttman’s executive coaching theories revolve around attempting to challenge behavior, not thoughts. He believes that a key factor in behavior change is the reframing of perceptions, which he refers to as “going-in stories.” These stories make up the inner narrative that people tell themselves about why they behave as they do. Guttman suggests that to break through the barriers that have been holding them back, executives and individuals need to become conscious of their negative “going-in stories” and replace them with positive ones. = Essential management skills = With its global reach and matrixed structure, the modern corporation is significantly different from that of the past. This new model, in which work is done primarily by cross-functional teams, requires a new set of skills, including influencing, active listening, and conflict management. In the horizontal organization that Guttman sees emerging, these skills, once thought to be at best peripheral, now are central to the achievement of superior individual, team, and organization performance. = The Ideas in Practice = A number of senior executives have offered written commentary on how they have put Guttman's ideas into practice in their organization. Guttman's quarterly e-newsletter, GDS Insights, includes interviews with senior executives who explain how they have applied the concepts and the results they have achieved. Among them: Derek Hopkins, chief commercial officer, Keurig Dr Pepper; Todd Lachman, president and CEO, Sovos Brands; Marc Speichert, chief digital officer, GlaxoSmithKline; and Charlie Jacobs, chief executive officer Delaware North's Boston Holdings and alternate governor Boston Bruins.Archived interviews with these and other executives can be found at http://www.guttmandev.com/newsletter.shtml Guttman Development Strategies' White Paper, \\"Organization Development: Accelerating to High Performance Through Multi-Tier Alignments,\\" includes three case studies, based on interviews with company leaders, which demonstrate the concepts in use in Mars, Inc.'s Latin American Division; Redken USA; and INTTRA, Inc.

History The Milarepa Fund was founded in May 1994,A History of the Milarepa Fund by musician Adam Yauch and activist Erin Potts. The fund was named after the 11th century Tibetan singer-yogi Milarepa, and was originally intended to distribute royalties from Yauch's Beastie Boys' 1994 songs \\"Shambala\\" and \\"Bodhisattva Vow\\", which had sampled the chanting of Tibetan monks, to support Tibetan independence. The first action for the fund was during the 1994 Lollapalooza tour. Because the Beastie Boys were co-headlining the tour, the Milarepa Fund set up information tents to pass out pro-Tibetan independence pamphlets throughout the tour. Some fans were receptive to the pamphlets, but others were hostile, and later blamed Yauch's interest in the Milarepa Fund for the late release of the Beastie Boys' fifth album, Hello Nasty. Expanding upon that idea, the Milarepa Fund put on a two-day concert in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park called the Tibetan Freedom Concert in 1996, which raised over $800,000 for Tibetan exile organizations. The success of the concert spawned a Free Tibet Tour that summer in conjunction with Students for a Free Tibet (SFT) and the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT). Other two-day concerts similar to the 1996 Tibetan Freedom Concert followed in 1997, 1998, and 1999.

Comprising more than 325 acres, the park is managed by the Department of Parks and Recreation of the city of Aurora, and has co-owned areas with the Fox Valley Park District. History Travis Phillips was a merchant in Aurora who had served as an alderman in the city and as its mayor. His deep love for the area became clear when it was learned after his passing that his will designated $24,000 from his estate be used to purchase land for a park that would be donated to Aurora. On November 21, 1899, the deed of purchase was signed for 60 acres. The land bought had been used as a picnic area for family outings as early as 1835 when it was known as Scharschug's Woods, and was built up as an entertain area in the early 1870s by the Aurora Sharp Shooter Society.Roth, Amy. \\"Phillips Park Turns 100 with Rich History.\\" Beacon News, The. 28 February 1999. At the time of its purchase it was called City Park, though most residents simply referred to it as Phillips Park, a name the city council officially gave it in 1902. The next major historical moment for the park was March 7, 1934, when mastodon bones were found during the Phillips Park Lake Excavation Project, sponsored by the Civil Works Administration during the Great Depression. Because of the discovery of bones the lake is still referred to as Mastodon Lake. The bones have traveled to different museums over the years, but now they are housed in the visitor center of the park that was built in 2003. Improvements by the Works Progress Administration in 1938 included planting trees and shrubs, building fireplaces and animal pens, and new cages. The park has grown over the years adding new attractions, and still continues to be a place for family outings. Attractions The Sunken Gardens in 2010 Aquatic Center: In a joint venture the water park was constructed in 1991 and included a tube slide, a body slide and two drop-off slides, a children's play pool with a waterfall and water cannons, as well as a tot slide. There is also a hot tub, a sand play area, a sand volleyball court and concessions. Golf Course: The first golf course on Phillips Park grounds was constructed in the 1920s. Improvements and renovations have created the modern course now on the grounds. The course was redesigned by Greg Martin and reopened in 2001. Phillips Park Zoo: Phillips Park Zoo was founded in 1915 and is still open daily with no admission. Recreational Areas: Sites in the park included the waterfall, World War I cannons and numerous veteran related monuments. Among the amenities are a large state-of-the-art playground, a toddler's playground, picnic pavilions, sand volleyball courts, tennis courts, horseshoe courts, a jogging/bike path, fishing piers, an ice skating pond, and a sledding hill. Special events and activities are co-sponsored throughout the year with The Friends of Phillips Park. Sunken Gardens: The original gardens were designed and developed by Ray Moses in the 1930s. In 2002 the gardens were rededicated to the east side of the zoo.Cetera, Mike. \\"Treasured Sunken Garden Will be Rededicated.\\" Beacon News, The. 24 June 2002.

In 1995 he accepted an offer to become a professor at Harvard Medical School, Boston. In 1997 he became an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Biography Rapoport was born in Cincinnati in 1947. His parents, Samuel Mitja Rapoport and Ingeborg Rapoport, had fled the Nazis, and when he was three years old, they fled the United States in 1950 due to being investigated for un-American activities. After a brief stay in Vienna, they finally settled in Berlin in the German Democratic Republic in 1952, where his father became a Professor for Biochemistry and director of the Institute of Physiological Chemistry of the Humboldt-University, and his mother became a Professor for neonatology at the Charite Hospital. His brother is mathematician Michael Rapoport. Tom A. Rapoport received his PhD on mathematical modeling of the kinetics of inorganic pyrophosphatase in 1972 from Humboldt University. He worked in the lab of Peter Heitmann, and his father, Samuel Mitja Rapoport, was head of the Institute of Physiological Chemistry. At Humboldt he collaborated with Reinhart Heinrich on the mathematical modeling of glycolysis in red blood cells, leading to the establishment of metabolic control theory on which they submitted a joint 'habilitation' thesis. At the same time he worked with Sinaida Rosenthal, a former student of his father, on cloning the insulin gene from carp. In 1979 he moved to the Zentralinstitut für Molekularbiologie der Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR, later called the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine, where he became a professor in 1985. He moved to the United States, the country his parents fled from in 1950, in 1995. He has been a professor at the Harvard Medical School since 1995, and an HHMI investigator since 1997. He studies several aspects of cellular secretion, including the mechanisms by which newly synthesized proteins are translocated from the cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by the Sec61 complex (also known as the translocon), how misfolded secretory proteins are degraded by endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (also known as ERAD), and how reticulons and related proteins regulate the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum.

History According to Livy, word had come to Rome of the new and glorious temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and it was told that the temple had been constructed through the combined effort of the cities of Asia Minor. The king of Rome, Servius Tullius, extolled the virtues of such an act of concord to the cities of the Latins, and convinced them to work with the Roman people to build a temple to Diana in Rome. The temple was built upon the Aventine Hill.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.45 Soon after the construction of the temple, a cow of remarkable beauty and size was born to the head of a Sabine family. It was foretold by the augurs that sovereignty would come to the city whose citizen sacrificed the cow to Diana. Accordingly, the Sabine man took the cow to the temple of Diana in Rome, and led her to the altar. However, before he could sacrifice her, the Roman priest of the temple confronted him, and asked whether he would make the sacrifice with impure hands, imploring the man to go and cleanse his hands in the Tiber. Once the Sabine had left the temple to go to the Tiber, the priest immediately sacrificed the cow, to the great satisfaction of Rome and its king. Later temple dedications often took as their model the ritual formulas and cult regulations devised for the Temple of Diana on the Aventine. If still in use by the 4th-century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Legacy A short street named the Via del Tempio di Diana commemorates the site of the temple today and part of its wall is located within one of the halls of the Apuleius Restaurant.

Historically, it reflects a time before the rise of multiculturalism where immigrants who arrived in the United States were more actively Americanized in assimilation programs. The building, now known as the Crown Heights Resource Center, was designed by Irving Gill. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The school was one of the last works by Gill, a pioneer of modern architecture and one of nearby San Diego's most celebrated architects.Dirk Sutro, Oceanside's Treasure-Trove of Gill Buildings, Los Angeles Times, October 22, 1992, Accessed November 4, 2010.

Several were in Oceanside, where he continued to try to develop his work. The Americanization school displays hints of Art Deco while also taking in North African–Islamic influences that he picked up from his brief partnership with Frank Mead, another San Diego architect. Gill designed the wood-frame and stucco structure to fit its triangular, wedge-shaped corner site. With a prominent corner, Gill placed an arched entryway with a minimalist Islamic-style dome atop a short, octagonal tower. For class space, Gill planned two wings to run back from the corner, along the length of the lot in a V-shape; however, only one was ever built. To break up a potentially monotonous wall, he stepped the classes into three sections along the edge of the property. To bring in natural light, he placed clerestory windows and French doors to the south-facing side. Conversion Front view By the early 1990s, the structure was not in use, rundown and boarded up. In 1992, the City of Oceanside began a $316,000 restoration, with $50,000 in city money and the rest in donated services. The Crown Heights Resource Center moved into the structure in July 2001 from a nearby house. The resource center was initially opened in 1996 in response to the high crime rate and gang activity in the surrounding neighborhood, and is operated by the Housing and Neighborhood Services Department of the City of Oceanside.Community Resource Centers , City of Oceanside, Accessed November 4, 2010.

The firm had previously built under licence a number of Minicabs, Supercabs and Jodels, and originally intended to manufacture the Aviamilano F.8L Falco always under license. This project did not materialize and production series of Joigny was due to start in 1960. The Joigny was of all-wood construction and employed a fully retractable nosewheel undercarriage. The wing had a single main spar and an auxiliary main spar with leading edge torsion box and plywood covering. The aircraft's cabin section was built integral with the wing, the rear fuselage being a plywood monocoque. Dual controls were provided, and the hydraulically operated double-slotted wing flaps were supplemented by an hydraulically operated air brake.Green, 1965, p. 66 The development of a three/four seat version had been proposed.

Its main area lies broadly between St Luke's and Hackney Road, with an accelerator space for spinout companies at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. A cluster of web businesses initially developed around the Old Street Roundabout in 2008. The area had historically been relatively run down compared to the City of London, known as the 'City Fringe'. The 2008–09 recession further suppressed rents through the closure of numerous firms, making it affordable to technology start-ups, while redundancies from financial services companies, such as investment banks, released a local pool of experienced talent interested in entrepreneurship. From 2010, as the cluster developed, both local and national government supported its growth, with the goal of creating a cluster comparable to Silicon Valley in the United States. Cisco, Facebook, Google, Intel, McKinsey & Company and Microsoft are among the companies that have invested in the area. City, University of London, London Metropolitan University, Imperial College London, Queen Mary University of London and University College London are all academic partners in projects based in the cluster. History Technology companies located in the area in 2008 included Dopplr, Last.fm, Consolidated Independent, Trampoline Systems, AMEE, Skimbit (now Skimlinks), Songkick, Poke London, Kizoom, Redmonk, MOO, LShift, Ket Lai, Solstice and Schulze & Webb. Other early companies to locate there were Tinker.it, flubit, TweetDeck, Berg, Fotango, weartical.com, Rummble, Squiz, Techlightenment, BrightLemon, Believe.in, Livemusic and WAYN. The name Silicon Roundabout was initially proposed as a tongue-in-cheek joke by Matt Biddulph. Plans to help accelerate the growth of the cluster were announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in a speech given in east London on 4 November 2010. A year later, Cameron announced that he was appointing entrepreneur Eric van der Kleij to lead the initiative. In 2010 there were 85 startup companies in the area. By 2011, approximately 200 firms were occupying the area, signifying a rapid increase in interest. Wired magazine updated this figure in 2012 and suggested some 5,000 tech companies were located in the wider area centred on the Old Street roundabout. Wired maintains a topic on the area. In 2015 Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economic and Business Research, which is based on Old Street, authored The Flat White Economy: How the Digital Economy Is Transforming London & Other Cities of the Future. On 28 September 2011 it was announced that Google had acquired a seven-storey building near Old Street roundabout. Google said that the building, in Bonhill Street, would host \\"a range of activities, such as speaker series, hackathons, training workshops and product demonstrations\\" in addition to providing workspace for new companies. The building, known as Campus London, opened in March 2012. In 2013 the Nominet Trust selected \\"5 startups making positive social change\\" which are based in the cluster: Streetbank, Give What You're Good At, Videre Est Credere, Buddy App and PaveGen.Tech City News, \\"London's Top Tech for Social Good ,\\" 13 August 2013. A report by EY published in 2016 highlighted the importance of London to the UK's FinTech industry in terms of availability of expertise and demand for services. The earlier activities of the Tech City Investment Organisation and its funding by then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson hit the headlines in 2019 concerning his connections to American entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri. =Investment= Investment in London's technology sector was $2.28 billion in 2015, 69 per cent higher than the $1.3 billion raised in 2014. Since 2010, London-based technology companies have collectively raised $5.2 billion of venture capital funding. Participants =Technology companies= Notable technology companies active in the cluster include: * 7digital * Amazon – has opened its Digital Media Development Centre in the area * Aurora Fashions Aurora Fashions – the company behind Coast, Oasis and Warehouse occupies one of the largest buildings around the Old Street roundabout (Exchange House) and with mobile sites and apps * Avoiding Mass Extinctions Engine (AMEE) * BT – has agreed to accelerate the roll-out of superfast broadband in the area * Bosch - London Connectory incubator * Cisco – has agreed to establish an Innovation Centre in the Olympic Park * DueDil * EE – has introduced 300Mbit/s 4G in the Tech City area * Facebook – has agreed to create a base for their Developer Garage programme in the hub * GoCardless * Google – has created an Innovation Hub in the area to develop next- generation applications and services (whilst retaining its UK headquarters also in central London) Google also hosts its Campus London Residency Programme in the area.

East London Radio launched in 2013 as an on-line talk community radio station run entirely by volunteers, with studios in several East London boroughs. =Public sector organisations= Public sector organisations active in the cluster included: * City of London Corporation – assisted in the creation of the Innovation Warehouse * Tech City Investment Organisation (TCIO) – a quango founded by then UK Government department UK Trade & Investment to encourage the growth and development of the Tech City cluster, since rolled out nationally as Tech Nation (NDPB). Housing As the cluster expands, a number of developments have been/or are due to be built, such as by ASAP Member Cuckooz, who launched its latest design-led apartments in 2018, targeted towards the tech companies and offer apartments in a renovated art deco style cinema dating back to 1870, and features a new arthouse cinema on the ground floor. While, the Atlas Building on Old Street has full planning permission and is substantially already pre-sold on the market. and The Maker, which is situated on Nile Street close to City Road on the very edge of Tech City and designed by Avanti Architects, which is underdevelopment and will provide 175 contemporary, apartments within an elegant 28-storey tower and connected low- rise building. Responses The rapid growth of the cluster has met with some criticism. The Centre for London think tank said in 2012 that it felt the development had little focus and could be counter-productive. The think tank also raised concerns over a skills shortage, connectivity, lack of mentoring and rising costs. Also that year Tech City was called a \\"marketing gimmick\\" on the wrong side of London, away from Heathrow Airport, which is still over 30% more expensive than any city outside London. James Dyson criticised the coalition government in 2012 for spending money on the scheme to attract international companies who Dyson argued would drive up rents instead of helping start-up and hardware companies, who he felt had greater potential than software and internet companies. Transport London Underground Northern line (City branch) and National Rail Northern City Line which is operated by Great Northern provide services at Old Street. With the increase in passenger numbers using the station, in 2014 Transport for London announced that it was to offer pop-up retail space at Old Street station as part of a drive to increase its revenue.

It was first photographed from the air on November 23, 1935 by Lincoln Ellsworth, and mapped from these photographs by W.L.G. Joerg. It was first surveyed in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) under John Rymill, and was named in 1954 by members of the expedition for Neville Dixey, Chairman of Lloyd's of London in 1934, who raised a special fund at Lloyd's as a contribution towards the cost of the BGLE, 1934–37.

The feature appears to have been roughly charted on an 1860 sketch map by Captain H.C. Chester, an American sealer operating in the area during this period. It was surveyed in 1948 by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE), and named by them for Lieutenant Commander George M. Dixon, RANVR, commanding officer of HMAS Labuan which landed and relieved the 1948 and 1949 ANARE parties. The peak is 9 km. from the NW side of Big Ben. As a scoria volcano, no activity has been observed on Mount Dixon, however some lava flows that are vegetation-free suggest an eruption within the last few hundred years.
