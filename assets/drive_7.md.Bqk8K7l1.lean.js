The academies had a great and lasting impact on the development of world Jewry, including the creation of the Jerusalem Talmud. The region designated as the Land of Israel / Eretz Yisrael in Jewish sources was during the Talmudic period also officially known as Syria Palaestina (under the Romans) and Palaestina Prima / Palaestina Secunda (under the Byzantines).  Council of Jamnia  The Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE put as abrupt an end to the disputes of the schools as it did to the contests between political parties. It was then that a disciple of Hillel the Elder, Johanan ben Zakai, founded a new home for Jewish Law in Yavne (Jamnia). The seat of the Sanhedrin at Yavne, which at once constituted itself the successor of the Great Sanhedrin of Jerusalem by putting into practice the ordinances of that body as far as was necessary and practicable, attracted all those who had escaped the national catastrophe and who had become prominent by their character and their learning. Moreover, it reared a new generation of similarly gifted men, whose task it became to overcome the results of the Bar Kokhba revolt. During the interval between these two disasters (56-117), or, more accurately, until the Kitos War under Trajan, the school at Yavne was the recognized tribunal that gathered the traditions of the past and confirmed them; that ruled and regulated existing conditions; and that sowed the seeds for future development. Next to its founder, it owed its splendor and its undisputed supremacy especially to Gamaliel II, a great-grandson of Hillel. To him flocked the pupils of Johanan ben Zakkai and other masters and students of the Law and of Talmudical hermeneutics. Although some of them taught and labored in other places ‚Äì Eliezer ben Hurcanus in Lod; Joshua ben Hananiah in Peki'in; Rabbi Ishmael in Kefar Aziz, Rabbi Akiva in Bnei Brak; Haninah ben Teradion in Siknin ‚Äì Yavne remained the center; and in \\"the vineyard\\" of Yavne, as they called their place of meeting, they used to assemble for joint action.  Levantine Judaism restored  In the fertile ground of the Yavne Academy the roots of the literature of tradition ‚Äî Midrash and Mishnah, Talmud and Aggadah ‚Äî were nourished and strengthened. There, too, the way was paved for a systematic treatment of Halakhah and exegesis. In Yavne were held the decisive debates upon the canonicity of certain Biblical books; there the Jewish liturgy received its permanent form; and there, probably, was edited the Targum on the Pentateuch, which became the foundation for the later Targum named after Onkelos. It was Yavne that inspired and sanctioned the new Greek language version of the Bible ‚Äî that of Akylas (Aquila of Sinope). The events that preceded and followed the great civil revolution under Bar Kokhba (from the year 117 to about 140) resulted in the decay and death of the school at Yavne. According to tradition, the Sanhedrin was removed from Yavne to Usha, from Usha back to Yavne, and a second time from Yavne to Usha.Rosh Hashana 31b. This final settlement in Usha indicates the ultimate spiritual supremacy of Galilee over Judea, the latter having become depopulated by the war of Hadrian. Usha remained for a long time the seat of the academy; its importance being due to the pupils of Akiba, one of whom, Judah bar Ilai, had his home in Usha. Here was undertaken the great work of the restoration of Levantine Judaism after its disintegration under Hadrian. The study of the Law flourished anew; and Simeon ben Gamliel II, was invested with the rank that had been his father's in Yavne. With him the rank of nasi or patriarch became hereditary in the house of Hillel, and the seat of the academy was made identical with that of the patriarch.  Location of the Patriarchate  In the time of Shimon ben Gamaliel II, the seat of the Patriarchate frequently shifted location; its first move being from Usha to Shefa-'Amr; thence, under Simeon's son and successor, Judah the Prince, to Beit She'arim; and finally to Sepphoris, where a celebrated disciple of Akiba, Jose ben Halafta, had been teaching. Only with great difficulty could Shimon ben Gamaliel establish his authority over this pupil of Akiba, who far outshone him in learning. Shimon's son, Judah I, however, was fortunate enough to unite with his inherited rank the indisputable reputation of a distinguished scholar, a combination of great importance under the circumstances. Judah, in whom \\"Torah and dignity\\" were combined, was the man appointed to close an important epoch and to lay the foundation of a new one. The academy at Sepphoris, to which eminent students from Babylonia also flocked, erected an indestructible monument to itself through Judah's activity in editing the Mishnah, which attained to canonical standing as the authentic collection of the legal traditions of religious practise. In the Mishnah, the completion of which was accomplished soon after the death of its author or editor (about 219), the schools both of the Land of Israel and of Babylonia received a recognized text-book, upon which the lectures and the debates of the students were thence-forward founded. The recognition of Rabbi Judah's Mishnah marks a strong dividing line in the history of the Academies and their teachers: it indicates the transition from the age of the Tannaim to that of the Amoraim.  Centers of learning  After Judah's death Sepphoris did not long remain the seat of the patriarch and the Academy. Gamaliel III, the unpretentious son of a distinguished father, became patriarch; but Hanina bar Hama succeeded him as head of the school, and introduced the new order of things that commenced with the completion of the Mishnah. In Hanina's lifetime the last migration of the Sanhedrin occurred. His pupil, Johanan bar Nappaha, settled in Tiberias, and the patriarch Judah II (grandson of Judah I) soon found himself compelled to remove to that city. The imposing personality and unexampled learning of Johanan rendered Tiberias for a long period the undisputed center of Levantine Judaism, the magnet which attracted Babylonian students. When Johanan died in 279‚Äîthis is the only settled date in the whole chronology of the Amoraim‚Äîthe renown of the Tiberias Academy was so firmly established that it suffered no deterioration under his successors, although none of them equaled him in learning. For a time, indeed, Caesarea came into prominence, owing solely to the influence of Hoshaya, who lived there in the first half of the third century, and exercised the duties of a teacher contemporaneously with the Church Father Origen, with whom he had personal intercourse. After Johanan's death the school at C√¶sarea attained a new standing under his pupil Abbahu; and throughout the whole of the fourth century the opinions of the \\"sages of Caesarea\\" were taken into respectful account, even in Tiberias. Sepphoris also resumed its former importance as a seat of learning; and eminent men worked there in the fourth century, long after the disaster to the city wrought by the forces of the emperor Gallus. From the beginning of the third century there had been an academy at Lydda in Judea, or \\"the South,\\" as Judea was then called. This academy now gained a new reputation as a school of traditional learning. From it came the teacher to whom Jerome owed his knowledge of Hebrew and his insight into the Hebr√¶a Veritas. But neither Caesarea, Sepphoris, nor Lydda could detract from the renown of Tiberias. Tiberias accordingly remained the abode of the official head of Judaism in the Land of Israel and, in a certain sense, of the Judaism of the whole Roman Empire, as well as the seat of the Academy, which considered itself the successor of the ancient Sanhedrin. The right of ordination which, since Shimon ben Gamliel II, the patriarch alone had exercised (either with or without the consent of the Council of Sages), was later on so regulated that the degree could only be conferred by the patriarch and council conjointly. The patriarchal dignity had meanwhile become worldly, as it were; for exceptional learning was by no means held to be an essential attribute of its possessor. The Academy of Tiberias, whose unordained members were called ·∏•aberim (associates), never lacked men, of more or less ability, who labored and taught in the manner of Johanan. Among these may be mentioned Eleazar ben Pedat, Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi, Hiyya bar Abba, Rav Zeira, Samuel ben Isaac, Jonah, Jose, Jeremiah, Mani, the son of Jonah, and Jose ben Abin, who constitute a series of brilliant names in the field of the Halakah. In the department of the Aggadah ‚Äî always highly prized and popular in the Land of Israel - the renown of Tiberias was also greatly augmented by many prominent and productive workers, from the contemporaries and pupils of Johanan down to Tanhuma ben Abba, who was illustrious as a collector and an editor of aggadic literature.  The Jerusalem Talmud  The imperishable monument to the school of Tiberias is the Jerusalem Talmud (Palestinian Talmud), of which Johanan ben Nappaha laid the foundation; for which reason he is generally styled, although erroneously, its redactor or author. In point of fact, however, this work was not completed until nearly a century and a half after Johanan's death; and its close is undoubtedly connected with the extinction of the patriarchal office (about 425). But Tiberias did not therefore cease to be a seat of learning, although very little of its subsequent activity is known.  The Tiberian punctuation  Further importance was gained by Tiberias as the seat of the Masoretic traditions and innovations; for there in the seventh century was introduced that system of punctuation which was destined to aid so efficiently in the proper reading and understanding of the Biblical text. This system, which achieved universal recognition, is called the \\"Tiberian punctuation\\". At Tiberias flourished, about the middle of the eighth century, the Masorite Phinehas, called also Rosh Yeshiva (\\"Head of the Academy\\"), and Asher the Great, forefather of five generations of Masorites (Nehemiah ben Asher, Moses ben Nehemiah, Asher ben Moses, Moses ben Asher, and Aaron ben Moses), was to a certain extent his contemporary. The last-named Aaron ben Moses ben Asher (briefly called Ben Asher), a contemporary of Saadia Gaon, brought the Tiberian school of Masorites to a distinguished end. Tiberias thereafter ceased to play any part in Jewish learning, until, in the twelfth century, it emerged for a brief period, and again in the sixteenth century, when it became the object of the pious ambition of Don Joseph Nasi of Naxos.

At the time of his death, Pollack held the distinction of being the only individual still working for the NBA since its inaugural 1946‚Äì47 season. Because of his proclivity to statistics, then Philadelphia Bulletin writer George Kiseda pinned the moniker of Super Stat on him in 1966.John Bunn Award Recipient Early life Pollack played basketball for Simon Gratz High School and graduated in 1943 from Temple University in Philadelphia. Career He took his first job as a sportswriter for the Philadelphia Bulletin after serving as a soldier in the United States Army during World War II. In 1946‚Äì47 he started as the assistant publicity director for the Philadelphia Warriors of the Basketball Association of America, which later merged with the National Basketball League to form the National Basketball Association. Midway through the 1952‚Äì53 season, he became head of media relations for the Warriors. The Warriors were sold by owner Ed Gottlieb (a founder of the NBA) and the team moved to San Francisco in 1962 (renamed Golden State Warriors), but Pollack remained in Philadelphia, where he worked for the NBA in various capacities until the 76ers were formed in 1963. Pollack then served as the media relations director of the Philadelphia 76ers until the 1987‚Äì88 season, when he assumed the duties of director of statistical information for the team. Historical marker for Pollack in South Philadelphia Pollack holds the distinction of keeping score during Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game, on March 2, 1962. According to Pollack,it was the \\"Busiest night of my career\\" as there was no press. Thus, he was the statistician and sole reporter for the game. Pollack made Chamberlain the sign which he holds in his famous post-game photo. Pollack was responsible for many stats that are now officially recorded by the NBA, such as blocked shots, and he was the first statistician to separate rebounds into offensive and defensive. Some believe he coined the term \\"triple-double,\\" although others claim that it was coined by former Los Angeles Lakers public relations director, Bruce Jolesch. During the Sixers‚Äô offseason, Pollack analyzed all 1,230 play-by-play sheets from the previous season (every game of the regular season) to produce the Harvey Pollack's NBA Statistical Yearbook, a book of rare basketball information that took statistical analysis to a new level.NBA.com: The Original Superstat It includes stats such as the shot distance of every field goal, who gets their shot blocked the most, and other creative categories like \\"working-man,\\" which a player has to contribute to every category but no fouls or turnovers, and \\"trillionaire club\\" which is when player plays in a game and has all zeros across their name. This NBA publication evolved from developing the first of its kind media guides for the Philadelphia 76ers in 1966‚Äì67 and then separated later into a new NBA publication to become among the most distinguished compilations in the sports business. Pollack claimed that Wilt Chamberlain had not only a quadruple-double, but also a game where he recorded at least double digits in all five primary statistical categories. However, this has not been recorded in the books because the NBA had not officially adopted the statistics yet. Death On June 23, 2015, Pollack died at the age of 93.

CMS EXEC has been superseded by EXEC 2 and REXX. All three ‚Äî CMS EXEC, EXEC 2 and REXX ‚Äî continue to be supported by the IBM CMS product. The EXEC language *EXEC processes lines up to 130 characters long when entered from a terminal, or 72 characters when read from a file. *A label consisting of a dash followed by up to seven alphanumeric characters can prefix a CMS command or an EXEC control statement. *The interpreter parses commands into blank-delimited tokens of up to eight characters each. *Variables consist of an ampersand followed by up to seven alphanumeric characters. Variables can be either user- defined variables or pre-defined (\\"special\\") EXEC variables. *As each line is read the tokens are scanned. If they contain EXEC variables the variables are replaced by their value. *Comments. Comments in EXEC files begin with an asterisk in column one. All other statements are executable statements. *Null statements. A null statement contains no data items. *CMS commands. If the first data item on a line is not an asterisk or ampersand the EXEC processor considers the line to be a CMS command and passes it to CMS for immediate execution. *Assignment statements. An assignment statement assigns a value to an EXEC variable. It has the form &variable; = *Control statements.

Opened in 1873, it is the first and the oldest observatory of the Middle East in modern times. Nowadays the observatory has only an academic role. History The Lee Observatory opened in 1873, with Doctor Cornelius Van Dyck as its pioneer. The observatory was named in reference to Henry Lee, a wealthy British merchant from Manchester, who had made a significant donation to help finance its construction. The observatory had twin roles of sky gazing and serving as a meteorological station for the middle east. Several directors and assistants managed the Observatory, including Van Dyck, who pursued astronomy as a hobby and had bought most of the equipment himself, and Professors Mansour Jurdak and Owen Gingerich, who organised the \\"Open Nights Observatory\\" events and made contributions to the observatory library. Saad Sami Haddad drew a sky map of stars up to and including the 5th magnitude. He contributed in the filing of sunspot data taken daily and forwarded them to Zurich, the international center for sunspot research. Haddad made statistical tests revealing the significance of the East-West asymmetry of the sunspots activity, and was responsible for the gathering of meteorological data.

She owned Hull House and rented it to Jane Addams, before later giving the property to Addams along with hundreds of thousands of dollars of donations, contributing substantially to founding the comprehensive settlement house movement in the United States. She was a trustee of Hull House until 1898.Women building Chicago 1790-1990 : a biographical dictionary. Schultz, Rima Lunin, 1943-, Hast, Adele., Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress). Bloomington: Indiana University Press. 2001. pp. 202‚Äì204. . OCLC 44573291.  Early life  Culver was born in Little Valley, New York on March 3, 1832. She was the youngest of the four children of Lyman and Emeliza (Hull) Culver. Lyman Culver was a farmer and bought, cleared, and sold land. In 1838, Emeliza Culver died, and Helen Culver and her siblings were cared for by Lyman Culver's sisters until he remarried. Culver attended local schools and began teaching at a country school at age 14. She also enrolled in the Randolph Academy and Female Seminary in Randolph, New York. Her studies were interrupted when Lyman Culver suddenly died from Typhoid fever in 1852. His estate was bequeathed to his widow and two children from his second marriage. As a result, Helen Culver had to earn her own living at age 20.  Career  Culver graduated from Randolph Academy in 1852. Following graduation, Culver moved west with her brother Robert, settling near their grandfather in DeKalb, Illinois. In 1853, she started a private school in Sycamore, Illinois in an abandoned schoolhouse, and she also taught at the Dow Academy. In 1854, Culver relocated to Chicago, and from 1854-1861 she served as teacher and principal in various Chicago schools.Lake Forest Country Places Part XII: \\"Rookwoods\\" at 1O80 Ashlawn: Home of Helen Culver by Arthur Miller, published in the Lake Forest Journal, 10/12/1995 https://www.lakeforest.edu/library/archives/lf- country-places/culver.php. In this period, Culver developed her relationship with her cousin, Charles Jerold Hull, a real estate businessman. After Hull's wife, Melicent, died in 1860, Culver left public education to care for and teach Hull's son, Charles, and daughter, Fredrika. During the American Civil War, Culver served as a nurse under the United States Sanitary Commission. After the Battle of Stones River, Culver was stationed near Murfreesboro, Tennessee and was put in charge of a one-room, forty-bed hospital. After the war, Culver returned to Chicago and the Hull family. From 1868 to 1889 Culver worked with her cousin, Charles Hull, in his real estate ventures in Chicago and around the country, including Atlanta and Jacksonville, Florida. When Hull died in 1889, Culver inherited the real estate business.  Philanthropy  Besides backing Jane Addams, Culver supported several other important scholarly causes, such as giving over $1.1 million to the University of Chicago, making her one of the University's most important early donors.Building for a Long Future: The University of Chicago and its donors, 1889-1930, By Brandon L.

It narrates in third person the experiences of a young British Army officer as he is deployed on his first tour of duty, a four-month operation in Armagh and Belfast at the height of The Troubles. Plot introduction Set in the 1970s, ‚Äò‚ÄôA Breed of Heroes‚Äô‚Äô follows the deployment of young British Army officer Charles Thoroughgood on a four-month emergency tour of Northern Ireland. Charles is new to the army and the difficulty he has with adjusting to army life adds to the complications faced in Northern Ireland. Being an Oxford graduate at a time when over 90% of army officers were school leavers makes him a conspicuous target for his deranged Commanding Officer‚Äôs attention, as well as three to four years older than his fellow Second Lieutenants. Plot summary The first month of the tour is spent in the countryside of Armagh, where Charles‚Äô battalion make their presence felt by ending all British Army contact with the locals and pursuing a deliberately more aggressive stance than the previous garrison unit. The month is mainly boring, with most days spent carrying out menial tasks in barracks or conducting patrols. However, towards the end of the period an anti-vehicle mine meant for Charles‚Äô regular Land Rover patrol to an electricity sub-station destroys an electricity board van minutes before Charles arrives. Seeing his first explosion, as well as finding the scattered body parts of a man who should have been him and his soldiers, brings the realities of his situation home to him and increases his thoughts that he should never have joined the army: something which he must tackle throughout the book. In moving to Belfast for the remaining three months of the tour, things take a turn for the worse ‚Äì something Charles thought couldn‚Äôt happen after the endless boredom and sporadic fear of Armagh. Billeted in a working factory which produces bottles 24 hours a day, his company‚Äôs quarters are ridiculed by the entire Belfast garrison as the worst in the city. The floor given over to officers for accommodation, dining and radio watch-keeping consists of ‚Äòrooms‚Äô created only by cardboard separations. As well as the deprivations of the location, Charles finds the customs of army life difficult to understand and get used to, especially as they seem to have no logic behind them. The officers and men of his battalion learn to deal with the pressures and squalor of urban guerrilla warfare by drinking, making mischief and engaging in sexual orgies. Charles, always aloof from his brother officers and institutionally separated from his men, finds it hard not to constantly question his own competency and worth, both as an officer and a human being. Having been involved in two riots, he is moved to Battalion Headquarters after the Press Relations Officer (PRO) has a negligent discharge and shoots himself in the foot. Charles shares his room with the Adjutant, and sets about ensuring that the battalion is seen in a good light by the press. This task is complicated somewhat by his Commanding Officer‚Äôs hatred of the press and idiosyncratic way of doing things, but Charles finds living in the police station which houses HQ much more bearable than the grim surrounds of the factory. More escapades follow, with Charles being involved in heart racing riots and close scrapes with members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, as well as comic activities with his brother officers. During this time, Charles begins writing indirectly for The Times. His job as PRO leads him into contact with The Times' cowardly and drunkard Northern Ireland correspondent Beazley, who pays Charles and his Lance Corporal photographer to write and send his dispatches, thus allowing himself to avoid danger and sit in his hotel bar. Charles‚Äô slightly more pleasant life at HQ ends abruptly, however, with the bombing of the police station. The adjutant is killed and their room destroyed, leading Charles to be sent back to the Factory but still in his role as PRO. More brilliantly described riots and arms finds occur, while Charles realises that he both enjoys and excels at journalism through his arrangement with Beazley. Charles resolves to leave the army, and eventually amasses enough money to buy himself out of his contract which runs for another few years. His resignation is accepted, and he gains permission to leave on his battalion‚Äôs return to England. The climactic scene of the book involves Charles and his CO in a gun battle with some young IRA gunmen. Fighting through an alley, Charles fires at point blank range and misses his target several times, before hitting his mark and killing the teenage boy. Charles‚Äô reaction to his first kill is necessarily short, the battalion is preparing to leave Northern Ireland and return home. The novel ends with Charles, for the first time in the novel, being completely at ease, enjoying a parachute drop into England and revelling in the fact that all he has to worry about is the drop itself.

Prior to late 2011, Routes 6 and 138 followed a previous alignment over the Brightman Street Bridge, which has since closed. Once Route 6 enters Fall River, Route 138 leaves its concurrency and US 6 follows the two halves of Davol Street on either side of Massachusetts Route 79 before turning east on two-lane President Avenue, following up the Seven Hills to the Highlands neighborhood. At the end of President Avenue the road turns southward at a rotary (which also provides access to Massachusetts Route 24) onto four-lane Eastern Avenue. The road crosses over Interstate 195 one last time before turning eastward along Martine Street onto the \\"Narrows,\\" the thin strip of land between the Watuppa Ponds that also carries the interstate between Fall River and Westport. Once over the Narrows, the road turns southeast, travelling on a straight line through the town. Interstate 195 can be accessed from Route 6 in Westport via Massachusetts Route 88, which crosses over Route 6 shortly before ending at the interstate. At the Dartmouth line, the road turns due east at the eastern end of Massachusetts Route 177. After passing through the Dartmouth retail area and two roads (Reed Road and Faunce Corner Road) that provide access to Interstate 195, the route passes into the city of New Bedford. In New Bedford, the route splits just east of the terminus of Massachusetts Route 140 onto Kempton Street (eastbound) and Mill Street (westbound), two one-lane, one-way streets. The two halves join again to cross over Massachusetts Route 18 just before crossing the New Bedford ‚Äì Fairhaven Bridge into the town of Fairhaven. After passing the terminus of Massachusetts Route 240 the route continues east into Mattapoisett and Marion along a four- lane road. Access to I-195 is provided in both towns along North Street in Mattapoisett and Massachusetts Route 105 in Marion. US 6 then crosses the Weweantic River into Wareham. In the central part of town the route turns southeast along Main Street, then east-northeast along Sandwich Road before beginning a concurrency with Massachusetts Route 28, with the first being split one-way between east and west, just south of Massachusetts Route 25, the major connecting highway between Cape Cod and Interstates 195 and 495. The route passes through busy retail area of East Wareham before passing into the Buzzards Bay section of Bourne. The two routes split into east and west one- way sections again before Route 28 leaves the concurrency to cross the Bourne Bridge across the Cape Cod Canal. US 6 then follows the western side of the canal along the Scenic Highway before joining the right-of-way for Massachusetts Route 3 that ends at the Sagamore Bridge, in which US 6 crosses onto Cape Cod proper. = Cape Cod = Eastham US 6 is the primary highway serving the towns of Cape Cod, linking the communities to the Sagamore Bridge and to subsequent points north and west. Of the 15 towns on the Cape, US 6 enters all but three of them; it runs completely to the north of Falmouth, Mashpee, and Chatham. After crossing the canal via the Sagamore Bridge, US 6 becomes a freeway, known as the Mid-Cape Highway. From Bourne to Dennis at the cloverleaf interchange for exits 9A and 9B, the freeway is 4 lanes. The bridges from the Cape Cod Canal, to Oak Street in Barnstable Village (a half- mile west of Route 132), are unique in their construction since they are made out of concrete and granite. The road then reduces to a two-lane freeway with plastic stanchions posted on a small asphalt median. The two-lane freeway section has a secondary, less-formal name of \\"Suicide Alley\\", due to the high number of fatalities from head-on collisions before the median improvements were constructed from 1989-1992. The Mid-Cape Highway carries a speed limit of on the standard freeway and on the two-lane freeway. It remains like this until Orleans, where the freeway ends at a large rotary. Through Eastham and North Truro, US 6 is a four-lane surface street once again. Through Wellfleet and southern Truro, US 6 is a former 3-lane road converted to 2 lanes with broad shoulders. In Provincetown, US 6 is locally maintained, and ends as it started in the state, as a surface expressway once again before meeting Route 6A at the Cape Cod National Seashore. For the last several miles of its existence near Provincetown, eastbound Route 6 is actually heading west- southwest.  History  US 6's westbound facing terminus in Provincetown. This sign was erected in Summer 2010 = New England Interstate Route 3 = left Before the U.S. Highway system, the route from Rhode Island to Bourne, and from Orleans to Provincetown, was part of New England Interstate Route 3 (NE-3). Within the Upper Cape, however, NE-3 went along what is now Route 28 between Bourne and Orleans. The U.S. 6 designation was instead applied to the route on the north shore of Cape Cod, which was known as New England Interstate Route 6 before 1926 (now Route 6A). Prior to the building of Interstate 195, the Fall River portion of Route 6 followed a different alignment. After entering the city via the Brightman Street Bridge, the route followed Davol Street to Turner Street, where it split to Durfee Street, a short portion of South Main Street and Pleasant Street (eastbound) and North Main Street to Bedford Street to Eastern Avenue (westbound, in reverse order). Both routes then took Pleasant Street east of Eastern Avenue to McGowan Street, which crossed into Westport and joined the current alignment of Route 6. The current alignment of these streets would be impossible now, as Turner Street's connection to Durfee Street is blocked, and both Pleasant Street and McGowan Street end just before the ramps between Interstate 195 and Route 24. Their former pathway into Westport is also gone, replaced by the path of the interstate. The only remnants of the old path is the odd turn Old Bedford Road takes before intersecting, having once been a separate street; the original alignment would have extended straight to Route 6. = U.S. Route 6 Bypass = When U.S. 6 was first routed through Provincetown in 1926, the highway was signed along the rather narrow Commercial Street. After the Provincetown U.S. 6 bypass was built, congestion and the increasing size of automobiles forced the town to post most of Commercial Street (all but the easternmost mile that hits the Truro line) as one-way westbound. Route 6A, when signed, was placed along the paralleling Bradford Street instead. There was an alternate plan at the time to make Bradford one-way westbound and Commercial one-way eastbound (which would have made both roads Route 6A), but this was rejected, as the town decided instead to let incoming traffic through the heavy Commercial Street (almost entirely pedestrian) business district. left left U.S. 6 was briefly signed on current I-195 between Route 105 and Route 28; however, when I-195 was completed, and the I-195 designation took over that section of freeway, U.S. 6 reverted to its older route. Formerly, U.S. 6 took both sides along the Cape Cod Canal (and was signed as \\"BYPASS 6\\"), but is now routed only on the north side (The south side is now signed \\"TO 6\\" from the Sagamore Bridge to the Bourne Bridge). However, a single \\"BYPASS 6\\" sign still exists along Sandwich Road just north of the Bourne Bridge rotary.  Future  MassDOT planned to change the exit numbers along the Mid-Cape Highway in 2016 as part of sign replacement contract to be run concurrently with a statewide project to convert freeway exit numbers from a sequential to a distance-based system. The new exit numbers would have ranged from 55 in Sandwich to 88 in Orleans. The first interchange on the Mid-Cape with Route 3 that is now signed as exits 1A-B would have been resigned as exits 55A-B, and so forth. However, in February 2016, when local Cape Cod officials found out about the plan, including the new numbers and that the signs would be larger than the current ones to be placed on overhead gantries, they complained to MassDOT and their local legislators. In response, MassDOT announced at a June 2016 public meeting that it listened to the public comments and were re-designing the signs to match the size of the current ones and that the exit numbers would not be changed, for now. The exit tabs and gore signs for the new signage would be designed however so the milepost numbers could fit on them, if changed, sometime in the future. The winning bid for the scaled down contract simply to replace the signs was made by Liddell Bros. Inc. of Halifax and announced on February 7, 2017. The project should start later in the spring and could be completed by the end of the year. On November 18, 2019, MassDot confirmed that beginning in late summer 2020 the exit renumbering project will begin from the west part of the state and working eastward.

In small hand weaving such as Inkle weaving and tablet weaving the beater may be combined with the shuttle into a single tool. In rigid heddle looms the beater is combined with the heddles. Beaters appear both in a hand-held form, and as an integral part of a loom. Hand beaters must have enough mass to force the weaving into place, so they come in a variety of weights and sizes. Some may have lead inserts to provide additional heft for a smaller beater, and some are made entirely from metal. Loom beaters typically take the form of a bar mounted across the loom. The actual beating is done by a metal insert known as a reed, which contains a number of slots, known as dents, which the warp threads pass through.

Biography Oskar Luts was born into a middle-class family in J√§rvepera, central Estonia, at that time in the governorate of Livonia (Russian Empire). His younger brother was the film director and cinematographer Theodor Luts. He attended √Ñnkk√ºla village school in 1894. He went to Palamuse Parish parish school in J√µgeva County, attending from 1895‚Äì1899. From 1899‚Äì1902 he studied at the Tartu Reaalkool. In 1903 Luts started working as an apothecary apprentice in Tartu and Narva. After passing the apothecary apprentice exams, he went to work in Tallinn (1903). During his military service in Saint Petersburg (1909‚Äì1911) he also worked in the apothecary field. He continued this work in Dorpat while studying pharmacy at university. When World War I started, Oskar Luts was conscripted into the Russian army. He worked as a military pharmacist in Pskov, Warsaw, Daugavpils, Vilnius and in Vitebsk (1915‚Äì1918), where he got married. Oskar Luts was released from military duty for health reasons in the autumn of 1918 and went back to Tartu with his family the same year, where he started working as an apothecary. In 1919‚Äì1920 he worked at the university library and then managed a store. In 1922 he started his professional career as a writer. In 1936 Luts began living in his home on Riia Street in Tartu. This house was converted into a museum in 1964. Oskar Luts was the first Estonian writer to receive the title of People's Writer of the Estonian SSR. This was awarded to him in 1945. Oskar Luts is buried in Ropka-Tamme cemetery. Some streets and buildings in Estonia bear Oskar Luts's name. The Oskar Lutsu Palamuse G√ºmnaasium in Palamuse was named in honor of Luts. Writing Portrait by Nikolai Triik (1928) Oskar Luts created his happiest literary works in the years before World War I. He wrote several comedies as well as his first novel called ' (Spring) (part I 1912, part II 1913). This highly popular novel portrayed the daily school life of young people in rural Estonia. Kevade proved to be Oskar Luts's most successful and well-known work. The life of the same characters continued in Luts's novel Suvi (Summer) (I 1918, II 1919), which also became quite popular. However, although subsequent sequels (Tootsi pulm (Toots's Wedding), Argip√§ev (originally √Ñrip√§ev, Workdays)) and the novel S√ºgis (Autumn) (part I ‚Äì 1938) were written to meet public demand, they did not attain the popularity of his earlier works. After World War I, his works contained less humor and were much gloomier. The second part of S√ºgis remained in manuscript form for decades, the entire story not being published until 1988. There are highly popular Estonian films (in Estonian and Russian languages) Spring, ' (based on Suvi and Tootsi pulm) and ' (based on Argip√§ev and S√ºgis). The films are all produced by Arvo Kruusement. Oskar Luts also wrote for children, and his most popular children's book is Nukitsamees (1920), which has also been made into a 1981 film ('). The music for Nukitsamees was written by and is as popular as the film itself. As a playwright, Oskar Luts is best known for Kapsapea (The Cabbage). The animation \\"Kapsapea\\" is based on Oskar Luts' writings. The cartoon is about a large cabbage growing in the garden of an Estonian family. The cabbage eventually causes a sensation in the US, Russia and China. Oskar Luts' works have been translated into many languages.

History Although law enforcement of a kind had been present in the Royal Burgh of Inverness since time immemorial, by 1827 the Inverness Courier complained of the lack of an efficient police. The Town Council from then on made use of the services of the Town Serjeants to enforce the law. In 1843 there was one Serjeant in overall charge and two more who patrolled the town during the day. A body of six watchmen patrolled the burgh at night. In 1840 the County of Inverness- shire (excluding the burgh) set up its own police, the Inverness-shire Constabulary, and in 1841 Inverness's Town Officers became part of the Inverness-shire force. The County Superintendent took overall command of the joint organisation and Town Serjeant Alexander Grant became Sub-Inspector for the Inverness District (including Inverness Burgh), with additional watchmen being appointed for the Burgh and Landward area. This arrangement existed until 1847, when the Royal Burgh set up its own police force, authority to do so being contained in a local Act of Parliament. The first Superintendent of Inverness Burgh Police was David Anderson, appointed on 4 September 1847. The force merged again with Inverness-shire Constabulary on 16 November 1968 to form the Inverness Constabulary.

He has been accused of illegally trafficking drugs in Wa State (an unrecognized state in Myanmar), in the US, and through Myanmar's border with China. Following the 2015 jade mine disaster in Hpakant, Kachin State, Wei Hsueh-kang was accused of exploiting locals and illegally funding mining operations in the area. This claim however, could not be verified or denied by Wei himself, as he was still in hiding.  Insurgency career  Hsueh-kang was following his father, who was then supported by CIA, selling opium to found Taiwanese (Republic of China) insurgency into mainland China until his graduation from high school when he joined Khun Sa's paramilitary.People's Daily 2005 Originally a member of Khun Sa‚Äôs Mong Tai Army (MTA), Wei Hsueh-kang was one of the original founders of the UWSA in 1989, following the collapse of the armed wing of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) in 1988.  Narcotics trafficker  Wei Hsueh- kang was believed to have remained closely associated with Khun Sa after he left the MTA, especially during the height of opium production in the Golden Triangle, and remains wanted by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs for drug offences committed within the United States; offering a $2 million reward for information leading to his capture and arrest. He is currently believed to be in Myanmar, probably within UWSA controlled territory of Wa State.

However, his affiliation with the UWSA reinforced doubts about the extent of his involvement in drug trafficking.  Entrepreneurship  In 1998, Wei Hsueh-kang founded the Hong Pang Group with money from the drug trade, and money from taking advantage of the privileges offered in the ceasefire deal by General Khin Nyunt. Its position in the country's economy, not just the Wa State, is reflected by a multitude of businesses it owns and controls in construction, agriculture, gems and minerals, petroleum, electronics and communications, distilleries, and department stores.

Although Kazakhstan has not described itself as an energy superpower, Kazakhstan's former president Nursultan Nazarbayev has claimed Kazakhstan will become a factor of energy security in Asia and Europe. Kazakhstan has a strategic geographical location to control oil and gas flows from Central Asia to East (China) and West (Russia, EU, global market).Kazakhstan exploits advantages of its geographical location between Asia and EU, Kazinform, 9 April 2017 Kazakhstan was a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which had four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.INOGATE website On January 1, 2013, Kazakhstan became the first country in Central Asia to launch an economy-wide carbon emissions system to cap emissions from its biggest emitters in the energy, coal, oil and gas extraction sectors. Overview The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources was the responsible governmental agency for energy policies until March 2010 when it was dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Oil and Gas and the Ministry for Industry and New Technologies.http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=KZ In June 2003, the government of Kazakhstan announced a new Caspian Sea development program, according to which new offshore blocks of oil and gas to be auctioned. In 2005, the government introduced new restrictions granting to the state-owned oil and gas company KazMunayGas status of contractor and at least half of any production sharing agreement (PSA). New tax structure, enforced in January 2004, included a so-called \\"rent tax\\" on exports, a progressive tax that increases as oil prices grow. The amendment raised the government's share of oil income to a range of 65-85%.The new structure includes an excess profit tax, and limits foreign participation to 50 percent in each offshore project with no guarantees of operatorship. In 2005, Kazakhstan amended the subsoil law to preempt the sale of oil assets in the country and to extend the government‚Äôs power to buy back energy assets by limiting the transfer of property rights to strategic assets in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan projects to inject 9.4 trillion tenge to prop up its power sector until 2030. Some 5.5 trillion tenge will be directed to power generation, 1.4 trillion to the national power grid and 2.5 trillion tenge to regional power distribution companies. The draft published in October 2012 provides for creating a unified power system, reducing environmental stress, increasing the share of renewable energy sources in Kazakhstan's power generation and introducing energy- efficient technologies. In 2013, Kazakhstan adopted the Energy Efficiency 2020 Program that would reduce emission 10% every year until 2015. Adopted by Prime Minister Serik Akhmetov, this new law would help reduce emissions and help with energy efficient solutions from large companies to small families. 2,000 industrial enterprises would be energy audits to meet with the new law. The program in the long run reduces the amount of energy per square meter by 30% and reduce costs by 14%.Kazakhstan adopts long-term energy efficiency program http://www.azernews.az/region/58701.html Primary energy sources Kazakhstan oil, gas, coal and uranium reserves are among the ten biggest in the world. =Oil= Kazakhstan is estimated to have around of crude oil reserves, which place it eleventh in the world. When discovered in the 1990s, the Kashagan oil field was the second largest oil field in the world.Esty, Benjamin C., and Florian Bitsch. \\"The Kashagan Production Sharing Agreement (PSA).\\" Harvard Business School Case 213-082, May 2013. (Revised September 2013.) In 2000s, the oil production has increased rapidly due to foreign investment and improvements in production efficiencies. In 2006, Kazakhstan produced 54 million tons of crude oil and 10.5 million tons of gas condensate , which makes Kazakhstan eighteenth-largest oil producer in the world. At these production levels Kazakhstan is thought to have approximately 50 years of remaining production. According to the president Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan is planning to increase its oil production up to of oil a day, of which 3 million will go to export. This will lift Kazakhstan into the ranks of the world's top 10 oil-producing nations. The main production sites are the Tengiz field , located on the northeast shores of the Caspian, and the Karachaganak field , located inland near to Russian border. In future Kazakh oil production will also rely on the Kashagan field, the largest oil field outside the Middle East, which possess anywhere from to in recoverable reserves, and the Kurmangazy field in Northern Kazakhstan. There are some smaller oil fields near the Chinese border, which are not developed/operational yet. 76% of Kazakhstan's oil and gas production and remaining reserves are concentrated in these three oil fields, as well as the Uzen Field. 14% of reserves and production are located in 6 further fields. The leading oil industry is state-owned oil company KazMunayGas. The landmark foreign investment in Kazakh oil industry is the TengizChevroil joint venture, owned 50% by ChevronTexaco, 25% by ExxonMobil, 20% by the Government of Kazakhstan, and 5% by Lukarco of Russia. The Karachaganak natural gas and gas condensate field is being developed by BG, Agip, ChevronTexaco, and Lukoil. Also Chinese, Indian and Korean oil companies are involved in the Kazakhstan's oil industry. Kazakhstan has three oil refineries: in Pavlodar, in Atyrau,Company Overview of Atyrau Refinery LLP and in Shymkent. Pavlodar and Shymkent refineries process West Siberian crude oil, which is imported through the Omsk (Russia) - Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) - Shymkent - T√ºrkmenabat (Turkmenistan) pipeline. =Natural gas= Kazakhstan's domestic hydrocarbon reserves amount to 3.3‚Äì3.7 trillion cubic metres of gas, of which 2.5 tcm are proven. However, Kazakhstan became a net gas exporter only in 2003. In 2007, Kazakhstan produced 29 bcm of natural gas and plans to increase its gas output to 60-80 bcm a year by 2015. The major natural gas fields are Karachaganak, Tengiz, Kashagan, Amangeldy, Zhanazhol, Urikhtau and Chinarevskoye. Kazakhstan's major gas company is KazMunaiGaS JSC that has a reported annual income of about $3 billion in 2013. =Coal= Although Kazakhstan is a substantial producer of oil and gas, coal has dominated both energy production and consumption.Caspian Oil and Gas , International Energy Agency, 1998, It contains Central Asia's largest recoverable coal reserves, with 34.5 billion short tons of mostly anthracitic and bituminous coal.Kazakhstan energy data, statistics and analysis - coal, US Energy Information Agency Major coal fields are Bogatyr and Severny. In 2005, Kazakhstan was the 9th biggest producer of coal in the world, and the 10th global exporter.Key World Energy Statistics. 2006 Edition , International Energy Agency 2006 Russia is the largest importer of Kazakh coal, followed by Ukraine. The biggest coal production company is Bogatyr Access Komir, which accounts for approximately 35% of Kazakh coal output. =Uranium= Kazakhstan is the number one Kazatomprom company country in the world for uranium production volumes, and it owns the world second biggest uranium reserves after Australia (around 1.5 million tons or nearly 19% of the explored reserves of uranium in the world).Uranium production in Kazakhstan as a potential source for covering the world uranium shortage, by Moukhtar Dzhakishev, World Nuclear Association Annual Symposium 2004Uranium and Nuclear Power in Kazakhstan , by Silk Road Intelligencer, 21 May 2008 In 2012 Kazakhstan produced 20,900 metric tons of uranium, of which 11,900 metric tons were produced by Kazatomprom, a state-owned holding company (2011: 19,450 total / 11,079 Kazatomprom). Kazatomprom also represents Kazakhstan in the joint ventures with Russian Tekhsnabexport, French AREVA and Canadian Cameco. All of produced uranium is going for export as the country's only nuclear power plant in Aktau was shut down in June 1999. There is a plan to build a new 1,500 MW nuclear plant in the southeast of Kazakhstan, near Lake Balkash.Kazakhstan energy data, statistics and analysis - electricity, US Energy Information Agency According to the mayor, Kyzylorda is planning to produce two-thirds of Kazakhstan's uranium by 2015.Kyzylorda region plans to produce two thirds of Kazakhstan uranium by 2015: mayor. BNews.kz http://www.bnews.kz/en/news/post/160028/ In 2014, Kazakhstan and the IAEA will sign an agreement to establish a low-enriched uranium fuel bank. The bank will be a place for countries to contribute uranium and disperse it to other nations safely for energy means with the IAEA being the governing body.http://bnews.kz/en/news/post/161603/ In August 2013, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano visited Kazakhstan to further discussions on the fuel bank and praised Kazakhstan's contribution to nuclear non-proliferation. In 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a meeting with Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov in Washington, \\"We view Kazakhstan not only as a regional player, but also as a global leader. Few countries can be compared to Kazakhstan in terms of its experience in non- proliferation.\\" Kazakhstan announced in January 2017 that the country was planning to cut its production of uranium by 10% due to a global oversupply of the commodity. According to Kazatomprom, state-owned uranium company and global production leader, even with the announced output cuts, Kazakhstan will continue to be the world‚Äôs No.1 uranium producer. Electricity The Law on Electricity was adopted in July 2004. Another basic act regulating electricity market is the Law on Natural Monopolies, which was last amended in December 2004. The market regulator is the Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies (ANMR). Kazakhstan's electricity system includes 71 power plants with total installed capacity of 18,572 MW.Kazakhstan ‚Äì electricity market , International energy regulation network the largest power plant is a coal- fired AES Ekibastuz GRES-2 in north-central Kazakhstan. 86.5% of electric power generation has been privatized. The government does not regulate prices for electricity, and consumers have free choice among providers of electric power (currently there is 15 licensed electricity traders).Kazakhstan profile , Energy Regulators Regional Association Transmission system is owned and operated by the state-owned company KEGOC. As of 1 January 2006, the total length of transmission lines was 23,383 km. There are 18 regional distribution (sale) companies. Government regulates transmission and distribution tariffs. =Renewable energy= Kazakhstan possesses 5 operational hydroelectric plants which provide roughly 12% of the electricity generation. The majority of the facilities are located on the Irtysh River. Other renewables are largely undeveloped although Kazakhstan has potential in renewable energy resources. Renewable energy sources could be particularly attractive in isolated rural areas.  Wind  A planned 100 MW wind farm, one of the largest in Central Asia, is expected to be constructed in 2020 in Zhanatas with funding support from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. =Nuclear energy= Kazakhstan currently has no nuclear power generation capacity, as the Aktau nuclear reactor, the country's only nuclear power plant, was shut down in June 1999. However, there is currently a plan to build a new 1,500 MW nuclear plant in the southeast of Kazakhstan, near Lake Balkash. Energy transportation Kazakhstan's oil pipeline system is operated by KazTransOil which was formed in 1997 when the two previous oil pipeline companies were combined. It is owed 100% by KazMunaiGaz which is also the owner of KazTransGaz which along with KazRosGaz are the two principle gas transportation companies. KazRosGaz is a joint venture between KazMunaiGaz and Gazprom which is involved in the export and trade of gas with Russia. =Oil pipelines= Sor Kaydak, Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan - NASA Earth Observatory Main oil export routes are the Caspian Pipeline Consortium and the Atyrau-Samara oil pipeline to Russia, and Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline to China. Kazakhstan is also a transit country for the Omsk (Russia) -Pavlodar (Kasakhstan) -Shymkent - T√ºrkmenabat (Turkmenistan) pipeline. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and Neka in Iran could be supplied by oil tankers. In addition, for the export to neighboring countries the rail transport is used. The Kazakhstan oil infrastructure is considered to be in poor condition which has constrained possible exports. Currently exports excluding the Caspian Pipeline Consortium is limited to . Kazakhstan is also further hampered as the oil pipeline infrastructure is not set up to transport oil from the producing assets in the west to the main refineries located in the east of the country. The CPC provides an important outlet for Kazakhstan oil and it is expected that it will be up graded so as to export close to . =Natural gas pipelines= The natural gas trunk pipeline system stretches 10,138 kilometers. The major transit pipelines are the Central Asia-Center gas pipeline system and the Bukhara-Urals pipeline, which transport natural gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to Russia, and Orenburg-Novopskov pipeline and Soyuz pipeline from Orenburg processing plant to Europe. The Gazli-Bishkek pipeline transports natural gas from Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan. The Central Asia-Center and the Bukhara-Urals pipelines as also the Bukhara-Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty pipeline are also main import pipelines. The main gas export goes to Orenburg processing plant in Russia. The export to Russia goes also through the Central Asia-Center and the Bukhara-Urals pipelines. There is plan to build a natural gas pipeline to China. To supply this pipeline, the Ishim (Rudny)-Petropavlovsk-Kokshetau-Astana pipeline is planned. International cooperation In general, various international organizations have played an important role in advising and assisting Kazakhstan's government in its energy sector reform and natural resource management.Roman Vakulchuk and Indra Overland (2018) ‚ÄòKazakhstan: Civil Society and Natural Resource Policy in Kazakhstan‚Äô, in Indra Overland (ed.) Public Brainpower: Civil Society and Natural Resource Management, Cham: Palgrave, pp. 143‚Äì162. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320657015 =Kazakhstan - the European Union= On 4 December 2006, Kazakhstan and the European Union signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which sets the framework for deeper energy cooperation. The memorandum establishes road maps on energy security and industrial cooperation. It was accompanied by a co- operation agreement to develop nuclear trade.EU, Kazakhstan strengthen energy links, by Euraktiv 5 December 2006EU and Kazakhstan sign agreement on closer energy ties Interactive Investor =Kazakhstan - Russia= Kazakhstan and Russia have close cooperation on energy issues. On 3 October 2006 during the presidents' meeting in Oral, Kazakhstan and Russia agreed to set up a gas- condensate-processing joint venture between Gazprom and KazMunayGas in Orenburg, which will be supplied from the Karachaganak field. The gas supply agreement was signed on 10 May 2007 in Astana. On 7 December 2006, the Kazakhstan's Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Baktykozha Izmukhambetov and the chief of the Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency Sergei Kiriyenko signed an agreement, in which Russia pledged to assist Kazakhstan in its nuclear program in return for shipments of uranium from Kazakhstan to Russia, where the uranium will be enriched. In addition, President of Kazatomprom Moukhtar Dzhakishev, and director of Russian uranium trader Tekhsnabexport Vladimir Smirnov signed a deal in which Tekhsnabexport will provide information regarding construction, transportation and logistics to help Kazakhstan develop its nuclear program. Russia already agreed earlier in 2006 to help Kazakhstan build two nuclear power plants. On 10 May 2007, Russia and Kazakhstan agreed to set up an international uranium enrichment center in Angarsk, East Siberia. The center is planned to come on stream in 2013. On 12 May 2007, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan signed an agreement providing for Central Asian gas to be exported to Europe through the reconstructed and expanded western branch of the Central Asia-Center gas pipeline system. =Kazakhstan - Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)= On October 17, 2013 the International Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) designated Kazakhstan ‚ÄúEITI Compliant‚Äù. Clare Short, Chair of the EITI Board said, ‚ÄúKazakhstan has reached an important milestone by becoming a full member of the EITI family. I hope that all parties will now work to ensure that this increase in transparency will lead to reform in the management of the extractive industries, bringing real benefits to the people of Kazakhstan and providing leadership in other countries in the region.‚Äù =Kazakhstan - IAEA= Kazakhstan and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) cooperated on several projects related to nuclear energy, agriculture, nuclear security, research, and others. Kazakhstan contributed to such projects of the IAEA as the development of nuclear power infrastructure and strengthening nuclear forensics. Kazakhstan also provided US $100 000 in extrabudgetary contributions for the renovation of the IAEA‚Äôs nuclear applications research laboratories.  Low Enriched Uranium Bank  On August 27, 2015 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Kazakhstan signed an agreement to set up the IAEA Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Bank in Oskemen, Kazakhstan. The IAEA LEU Bank, operated by Kazakhstan, will be a physical reserve of LEU available for eligible IAEA Member States.

Virtual engineering shares many characteristics with software engineering, such as the ability to obtain many different results through different implementations.  Description  = The concept = A virtual engineering environment provides a user-centered, first-person perspective that enables users to interact with an engineered system naturally and provides users with a wide range of accessible tools. This requires an engineering model that includes the geometry, physics, and any quantitative or qualitative data from the real system. The user should be able to walk through the operating system and observe how it works and how it responds to changes in design, operation, or any other engineering modification. Interaction within the virtual environment should provide an easily understood interface, appropriate to the user's technical background and expertise, that enables the user to explore and discover unexpected but critical details about the system's behavior. Similarly, engineering tools and software should fit naturally into the environment and allow the user to maintain her or his focus on the engineering problem at hand. A key aim of virtual engineering is to engage the human capacity for complex evaluation. The key components of such an environment include: * User-centered virtual reality visualization techniques. When presented in a familiar and natural interface, complex three-dimensional data becomes more understandable and usable, enhancing the user's understanding. Coupled with an appropriate expert (e.g., a design engineer, a plant engineer, or a construction manager), virtual reality can reduce design time for better solutions. * Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) Computer-aided manufacturing#cite note-ota-1Interactive analysis and engineering. Today nearly all aspects of power plant simulation require extensive off-line setup, calculation, and iteration. The time required for each iteration can range from one day to several weeks. Tools for interactive collaborative engineering in which the engineer can establish a dynamic thinking process are needed to permit real-time exploration of the ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù questions that are essential to the engineering process. In nearly all circumstances, an engineering answer now has much greater value than an answer tomorrow, next week, or next month. Although many excellent engineering analysis techniques have been developed, they are not routinely used as a fundamental part of engineering design, operations, control, and maintenance. The time required to set up, compute, and understand the result, then repeat the process until an adequate answer is obtained, significantly exceeds the time available. This includes techniques such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite elements analysis (FEA), and optimization of complex systems. Instead, these engineering tools are used to provide limited insight to the problem, to sharpen an answer, or to understand what went wrong after a bad design and how to improve the results next time. This is particularly true of CFD analysis. * Computer-aided engineering (CAE): Integration of real processes into the virtual environment. Engineering is more than analysis and design. A methodology for storage and rapid access to engineering analyses, plant data, geometry, and all other qualitative and quantitative engineering data related to plant operation still needs to be developed. * Engineering decision support tools. Optimization, cost analysis, scheduling, and knowledge-based tools need to be integrated into the engineering processes. Virtual engineering allows engineers to work with objects in a virtual space without having to think about the objects' underlying technical information. When an engineer takes hold of a virtual component and moves or alters it, he or she should only have to think about the consequences of such a move in the component's real world counterpart. Engineers must also be able to create a picture of the system, the various parts of the system, and how the parts will interact with each other. When engineers can focus on the making decisions for particular engineering issues rather than the underlying technical information, design cycles and costs are reduced. Software *UC-win/Road and VR Studio by FORUM8 *IC.IDO by ESI- Group = Usual denomination = Usually, the modules of virtual engineering are named as such: *Computer-aided design (CAD): It designate the capability to model a geometry using geometric operations that can be close to real life industrial machining process such as revolution, dressing, extruding. The CAD module is made to ease the generation of a geometrical shape. It comes usually with other modules, such as an engineering drawing making tool. *Computer- aided manufacturing (CAM): Even if the CAD provide an accurate virtual shape of the objects or parts, the manufacturing of these can be far different, just because the previous tool just dealt with perfect mathematical operation (perfect point, lines, plan, volumes). To take into account in a more realistic manner of the succession of manufacturing operations and to be able to certify that the end product will be close to the virtual model, engineers make use of a manufacturing module which represent a tool that machine the parts. *Computer-aided engineering (CAE): Another aspect is integrated in a Virtual engineering tool, which is the engineering analysis (finite element analysis of strains, stress, temperature distribution, flow etc.). Such tool can be integrated to the main software or separated. It is usual that the CAE modules software dedicated to that task, having less features in the CAD aspect. Often the tools can perform import/export to make the most of the each tool. Other modules can exist performing various other tasks, such as prototype manufacturing, product life cycle management, etc.  See also  * V-business References * McCorkle, D. S., Bryden, K.

It can be used as an alternative for total prohibition of alcohol. They exist in all Nordic countries except Denmark proper (only on the Faroe Islands), and in all provinces and territories in Canada except Alberta (which privatised its monopoly in 1993). In the United States, there are some alcoholic beverage control states, where alcohol wholesale is controlled by a state government operation and retail sales are offered by either state or private retailers. An alcohol monopoly also formerly existed in Taiwan between 1947 and 2002, which uniquely did not actually serve as a form of reducing alcohol abuse as was the case in the Nordic countries, Canada and the U.S., but was rather a post-colonial hangover from a system inherited from Japanese rule. The Taiwanese market was gradually opened to overseas brands starting from 1987, with full liberalisation achieved in 2002, the year when Taiwan was admitted to the WTO.  History  The alcohol monopoly was created in the Swedish town of Falun in 1850, to prevent overconsumption and reduce the profit motive for sales of alcohol. It later went all over the country in 1905 when the Swedish parliament ordered all sales of vodka to be done via local alcohol monopolies.Systembolaget.se About Systembolaget In 1895, Russia established a state monopoly on alcohol, which became a major source of revenue for the Russian government. Following the prohibition of alcohol in Norway in 1919, the wine-producing nations demanded a reflexive policy regarding the goods exported from Norway, and Vinmonopolet was established in 1922, as a response to a deal with France, which allowed Norwegians to buy as much table wine of any kind as they wanted.Vinmonopolet.no Vinmonopolet History When prohibition was lifted on fortified wine in 1923 and spirits in 1926, Vinmonopolet assumed sales of these goods as well. Unlike most of its Nordic neighbours, Denmark proper never had any period of alcohol prohibition or any state-owned alcohol monopoly, giving rise to its relatively liberal alcohol laws and drinking culture, however, the Faroe Islands, a constituent country of the Kingdom of Denmark, enacted alcohol prohibition in 1908 following a referendum held the previous year. Faroese people were however allowed to import very limited quantities of alcohol from Denmark proper for personal consumption after 1928, and after a referendum to lift prohibition in the Faroe Islands failed in 1973, the Faroe Islands finally lifted alcohol prohibition in 1992 with the establishment of the R√∫sdrekkas√∏la Landsins alcohol monopoly that same year. The Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation is the modern-day descendant of a government agency originally established during Japanese rule in 1901 which was responsible for all liquor and tobacco products in Taiwan as well as opium, salt, and camphor. In 1922, the agency began selling Takasago Beer through the Takasago Malted Beer Company, which was subsequently renamed as Taiwan Beer in 1946. After the end of World War II in 1945, the incoming Kuomintang preserved the monopoly system for alcohol and tobacco, and assigned the production of beer to the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau, which was renamed as Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau the following year. The Bureau exercised a monopoly on all alcohol and tobacco products sold in Taiwan until liberalisation of the Taiwanese alcohol market between 1987 and 2002, after which it was succeeded by the state-owned Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation which competes with many overseas brands today. The Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) is a company owned by the Government of Tamil Nadu, which has a monopoly over wholesale and retail vending of alcoholic beverages in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It controls the Indian- made foreign liquor (IMFL) trade in the state. A similar function is also performed by the Kerala State Beverages Corporation within the Indian state of Kerala.

Character Muviro is depicted as a somewhat elderly warrior of the Waziri, wise, brave and respected, and a good friend of Tarzan. He serves as the sub-chief of the tribe under Tarzan. He has two known relatives; Wasimbu, a son, and Buira, a daughter. In the Tarzan novels The character of Muviro emerges gradually in the novels, with the exact point at which he first appears in the saga somewhat debatable. The Waziri tribe itself first appears in The Return of Tarzan, the second book, and while Muviro is not named in that novel, he can be presumed to be among the numerous anonymous warriors mentioned. The first actual reference to him may occur in The Son of Tarzan, the fourth book, in which a \\"Muviri\\" appears as a minor character, stated to be a follower of Tarzan who had known him in \\"the old days.\\" The first unambiguous occurrence of the name Muviro is in Tarzan the Untamed, the seventh book, in which he is mentioned as the father of Wasimbu, a Waziri warrior crucified by the Germans during their World War I destruction of Tarzan's African estate. Muviro's earliest appearance in person (at least under that name) is in Tarzan and the Golden Lion, the ninth book, as one of the members of the tribe welcoming Tarzan's family back to the estate at the end of the war. Subsequent appearances include book 12, Tarzan and the Lost Empire, the first book to give his title as sub-chief,Burroughs, Edgar Rice. Tarzan and the Lost Empire, chapter 1: \\"'Something is coming, Bwana,' said Muviro, sub-chief of the Waziri.\\" book 13, Tarzan at the Earth's Core, in which he and some of his warriors accompany the Ape Man to the subterranean realm of Pellucidar, book 14, Tarzan the Invincible, book 15, Tarzan Triumphant, book 19, Tarzan's Quest, in which his search for his lost daughter Buira forms an important sub-plot to the main action, book 21, Tarzan the Magnificent, and the short story \\"Tarzan and the Champion,\\" collected in book 24, Tarzan and the Castaways. Muviro and his warrior band also appear in Back to the Stone Age, a non-Tarzan sequel to Tarzan at the Earth's Core set during the sojourn in Pellucidar. In other media Muviro is featured in Tarzan comic books and comic strips in a role identical to his portrayal in Burrough's Tarzan books. In the 2001 Disney series of animated cartoons The Legend of Tarzan, Muviro is recast as a villainous Waziri warrior. Serving the chief's son Basuli, he is secretly jealous of him, as well as hostile to outsiders, particularly Tarzan and his friends. When Basuli and Tarzan go on a quest to obtain an eagle's feather from a mountain in preparation for Basuli to wed and to become the next chief, Muviro plots to kill them both so that he himself can be chief. He engineers incidents causing several delays in the duo's journey; felling a tree into a river they are crossing, stampeding a herd of rhinos after them, and starting a rock slide as they near the mountain. He is exposed by Tarzan after his third attempt, and fights Basuli, who defeats and banishes him from the tribe for his treachery. Muviro is last seen walking away into the mist with an angry face, implying he may return for revenge. In the 2016 movie The Legend of Tarzan, Muviro, portrayed by Yule Masiteng, is chief of the Kuba, a tribe the young Jane Porter's father had served as a missionary, and to which she had brought the severely injured Tarzan after he had saved her from an ape attack. In the film, Muviro is a benevolent elder, as in the novels, as well as an educated, literate man fluent in several languages. He welcomes the now married Tarzan and Jane back to the Kuba village after their long absence in England, but is subsequently killed in a raid by L√©on Rom and his mercenaries.

In Western Christianity, heresy most commonly refers to those beliefs which were declared to be anathema by any of the ecumenical councils recognized by the Catholic Church. In the East, the term \\"heresy\\" is eclectic and can refer to anything at variance with Church tradition. Since the Great Schism and the Protestant Reformation, various Christian churches have also used the concept in proceedings against individuals and groups deemed to be heretical by those churches. The study of heresy requires an understanding of the development of orthodoxy and the role of creeds in the definition of orthodox beliefs, since heresy is always defined in relation to orthodoxy. Orthodoxy has been in the process of self-definition for centuries, defining itself in terms of its faith, and changing or clarifying beliefs in opposition to people or doctrines that are perceived as incorrect. Etymology and definition =Etymology= The word \\"orthodoxy\\" comes from Greek ·ΩÄœÅŒ∏ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒæŒØŒ± orthodox√≠a \\"right opinion\\". The word \\"heresy\\" comes from haeresis, a Latin transliteration of the Greek word originally meaning choosing, choice, course of action, or in an extended sense a sect or school of thought,Oxford English DictionaryLSJ, Definition of ancient Greek haeresis which by the first century came to denote warring factions and the party spirit. The word appears in the New Testament, usually translated as \\"sect\\",Bible Hub, All uses of haeresis in the New Testament and was appropriated by the Church to mean a sect or division that threatened the unity of Christians. Heresy eventually became regarded as a departure from orthodoxy, a sense in which heterodoxy was already in Christian use soon after the year 100.Jostein √Ödna (editor), The Formation of the Early Church (Mohr Siebeck 2005 ), p. 342 The first known usage of the term 'heresy' in a civil legal context was in 380 by the \\"Edict of Thessalonica\\" of Theodosius I. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as 'heresy'. =Definition= Orthodoxy is adherence to correct or accepted creeds, especially in religion.orthodox. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. Dictionary definition (accessed: March 03, 2008). Heresy is used today to denote the formal denial or doubt of a core doctrine of the Christian faithJ.D Douglas (ed). The New International Dictionary of the Christian Church Paternoster Press/ Zondervan, Exeter/Grand Rapids 1974, art Heresy as defined by one or more of the Christian churches.Cross & Livingstone (eds) Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1974 art Heresy It is distinguished from both apostasy and schism, apostasy being nearly always total abandonment of the Christian faith after it has been freely accepted,Pr√ºmmer, Dominic M. Handbook of Moral Theology Mercer Press 1963, sect. 201ff and schism being a formal and deliberate breach of Christian unity and an offence against charity without being based essentially on doctrine.Cross & Livingstone (eds) Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1974 arts apostasy,schism Since the time of the apostles, the term anathema has come to mean a form of extreme religious sanction beyond excommunication, known as major excommunication.Definition of major excommunication The earliest recorded instance of the form is in the Council of Elvira (), and thereafter it became the common method of cutting off heretics. In the fifth century, a formal distinction between anathema and excommunication evolved, where excommunication entailed cutting off a person or group from the rite of Eucharist and attendance at worship, while anathema meant a complete separation of the subject from the Church. Early Christianity (1st century - c.325 AD) =Scholarly approaches= The development of doctrine, the position of orthodoxy, and the relationship between the early Church and early heretical groups is a matter of academic debate. Walter Bauer, in his Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity (1934/1971), proposed that in earliest Christianity, orthodoxy and heresy did not stand in relation to one another as primary to secondary, but in many regions heresy was the original manifestation of Christianity. Bauer reassessed as a historian the overwhelmingly dominant view that for the period of Christian origins, ecclesiastical doctrine already represented what is primary, while heresies, on the other hand somehow are a deviation from the genuine (Bauer, \\"Introduction\\"). Scholars such as Pagels and Ehrman have built on Bauer's original thesis. Drawing upon distinctions between Jewish Christians, Gentile Christians, and other groups such as Gnostics and Marcionites, they argue that early Christianity was fragmented, and with contemporaneous competing orthodoxies. Ehrman's view is that while the specifics of Bauer's demonstration were later rejected, his intuitions are broadly accepted by scholars and got confirmed beyond what Bauer might have guessed. According to H. E. W. Turner, responding to Bauer's thesis in 1954, \\"what became official orthodoxy was taught early on by the majority of church teachers, albeit not in fully developed form.\\"H. E. W. Turner (2004), The Pattern of Christian Truth: A Study in the Relations between Orthodoxy and Heresy in the Early Church, Wipf and Stock Publishers, from the book-summary. According to Darrell Bock, a Christian apologist, Bauer's theory does not show an equality between the established church and outsiders including Simon Magus.Bock, Darrell L. The Missing Gospels: Unearthing the Truth Behind Alternative Christianities / According to Mitchell et al., each early Christian community was unique, but the tenets of the mainstream or Catholic Church insured that each early Christian community did not remain isolated.Frances M. Young (2006), The Cambridge History of Christianity Volume 1: Origins to Constantine, Series: Cambridge History of Christianity . G. K. Chesterton, in his book Orthodoxy (1908), asserts that there have been substantial disagreements about faith from the time of the New Testament and Jesus, but that the Apostles all argued against changing the teachings of Christ, as did the earliest church fathers including Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr and Polycarp. =Diversity= The Ante-Nicene period (2nd-3rd century) saw the rise of a great number of Christian sects, cults and movements with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period. They had different interpretations of Scripture, particularly the divinity of Jesus and the nature of the Trinity. Some of the major sects, cults and movements with different interpretations of Scripture than the Proto-Orthodox church were: *Gnosticism (particularly Valentinianism) ‚Äì reliance on revealed knowledge from an unknowable God, a distinct divinity from the Demiurge who created and oversees the material world. *Marcionism ‚Äì the God of Jesus was a different God from the God of the Old Testament. *Montanism ‚Äì relied on prophetic revelations from the Holy Spirit. *Adoptionism ‚Äì Jesus was not born the Son of God, but was adopted at his baptism, resurrection or ascension. *Docetism ‚Äì Jesus was pure spirit and his physical form an illusion. =Proto-orthodoxy= Before AD 313, the \\"heretical\\" nature of some beliefs was a matter of much debate within the churches, and there was no true mechanism in place to resolve the various differences of beliefs. Heresy was to be approached by the leader of the church according to Eusebius, author of The Church History. Early attacks upon alleged heresies formed the matter of Tertullian's Prescription Against Heretics (in 44 chapters, written from Rome), and of Irenaeus' Against Heresies (ca 180, in five volumes), written in Lyon after his return from a visit to Rome. The letters of Ignatius of Antioch and Polycarp of Smyrna to various churches warned against false teachers, and the Epistle of Barnabas accepted by many Christians as part of Scripture in the 2nd century, warned about mixing Judaism with Christianity, as did other writers, leading to decisions reached in the first ecumenical council, which was convoked by the Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325, in response to further disruptive polemical controversy within the Christian community, in that case Arianist disputes over the nature of the Trinity. Irenaeus ( ‚Äì ) was the first to argue that his \\"orthodox\\" position was the same faith that Jesus gave to the apostles, and that the identity of the apostles, their successors, and the teachings of the same were all well-known public knowledge. This was therefore an early argument supported by apostolic succession. Irenaeus first established the doctrine of four gospels and no more, with the synoptic gospels interpreted in the light of John. Irenaeus' opponents, however, claimed to have received secret teachings from Jesus via other apostles which were not publicly known. Gnosticism is predicated on the existence of such hidden knowledge, but brief references to private teachings of Jesus have also survived in the canonic Scripture as did warning by the Christ that there would be false prophets or false teachers. Irenaeus' opponents also claimed that the wellsprings of divine inspiration were not dried up, which is the doctrine of continuing revelation. Late Antiquity (313‚Äì476) and Early Middle Ages (476‚Äì799) =Christology= The earliest controversies in Late Antiquity were generally Christological in nature, concerning the interpretation of Jesus' (eternal) divinity and humanity. In the 4th century, Arius and Arianism held that Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was, therefore, of lesser status than God the Father. Arianism was condemned at the Council of Nicea (325), but nevertheless dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them. Trinitarianism held that God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit were all strictly one being with three hypostases. The Euchites, a 4th-century antinomian sect from Macedonia held that the Threefold God transformed himself into a single hypostasis in order to unite with the souls of the perfect. They were anti-clerical and rejected baptism and the sacraments, believing that the passions could be overcome and perfection achieved through prayer. Many groups held dualistic beliefs, maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. Docetism held that Jesus' humanity was merely an illusion, thus denying the incarnation. Others held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58 The orthodox teaching, as it developed in response to these interpretations, is that Christ was fully divine and at the same time fully human, and that the three persons of the Trinity are co-equal and co-eternal. =Legal suppression of heresies= It was only after the legalisation of Christianity, which began under Constantine I in AD 313 that the various beliefs of the proto-orthodox Church began to be made uniform and formulated as dogma, through the canons promulgated by the General Councils. The first known usage of the term 'heresy' in a civil legal context was in 380 by the \\"Edict of Thessalonica\\" of Theodosius I. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as 'heresy'. By this edict, in some senses, the line between the Catholic Church's spiritual authority and the Roman State's jurisdiction was blurred. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and State was a sharing of State powers of legal enforcement between Church and State authorities, with the state enforcing what it determined to be orthodox teaching. Within five years of the official 'criminalization' of heresy by the emperor, the first Christian heretic, Priscillian, was executed in 385 by Roman officials. For some years after the Protestant Reformation, Protestant denominations were also known to execute those whom they considered heretics. The edict of Theodosius II (435) provided severe punishments for those who had or spread writings of Nestorius. Those who possessed writings of Arius were sentenced to death. =Ecumenical councils= Seven ecumenical councils were convened between 325 and 787. These were mostly concerned with Christological disputes: #The First Ecumenical Council was convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325 and presided over by the Patriarch Alexander of Alexandria, with over 300 bishops condemning the view of Arius that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father. Each phrase in the Nicene Creed, formulated at the Council of Nicaea (AD 325), addresses some aspect that had been under passionate discussion prior to Constantine I. Nevertheless, Arianism dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them. #The Second Ecumenical Council was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity. This council also condemned Arianism. #The Third Ecumenical Council is that of Ephesus, a stronghold of Cyrillian Christianity, in 431. It was presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops and was mired in controversy because of the absences of the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch, the absence of the Syrian Clergy, and violence directed against Nestorius and his supporters. It affirmed that Mary is the \\"Bearer\\" of God (Theotokos), contrary to the teachings of Nestorius, and it anathematized Nestorius. A mirror Council held by Nestorius (Patriarch of Antioch) and the Syrian clergy affirmed Mary as Christokos, \\"Bearer\\" of Christ, and anathematized Cyril of Alexandria. #The Fourth Ecumenical Council is that of Chalcedon in 451, with the Patriarch of Constantinople presiding over 500 bishops. This council affirmed that Jesus has two natures, is truly God and truly man, distinct yet always in perfect union. This was based largely on Pope Leo the Great's Tome. Thus, it condemned Monophysitism and would be influential in refuting Monothelitism. #The Fifth Ecumenical Council is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the teachings of Origen on the pre- existence of the soul, etc. #The Sixth Ecumenical Council is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the Monothelites. #The Seventh Ecumenical Council was called under the Empress Regent Irene of Athens in 787, known as the second of Nicaea. It supports the veneration of icons while forbidding their worship. It is often referred to as \\"The Triumph of Orthodoxy\\" Not all of these Councils have been universally recognised as ecumenical. In addition, the Catholic Church has convened numerous other councils which it deems as having the same authority, making a total of twenty-one Ecumenical Councils recognised by the Catholic Church. The Assyrian Church of the East accepts only the first two, and Oriental Orthodoxy only three. Pope Sergius I rejected the Quinisext Council of 692 (see also Pentarchy). The Fourth Council of Constantinople of 869‚Äì870 and 879‚Äì880 is disputed by Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Present-day nontrinitarians, such as Unitarians, Latter-day Saints and other Mormons, and Jehovah's Witnesses, reject all seven Councils. Some Eastern Orthodox consider the following council to be ecumenical, although this is not universally agreed upon: #The Fifth Council of Constantinople was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the hesychastic theology of St. Gregory Palamas and condemned the philosopher Barlaam of Calabria. #In addition to these councils there have been a number of significant councils meant to further define the Eastern Orthodox position. They are the Synods of Constantinople in 1484, 1583, 1755, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of Ia≈üi (Jassy), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox Synod of Jerusalem, 1672. Within the Eastern Orthodox Church, the role of the ecumenical councils was to better define the Orthodox canon of faith; however, the Eastern Orthodox Church authorities are not known to have authorized the use of violence in the persecution of heretics with nearly the frequency of their Western counterparts. Some individual examples of the execution of Orthodox heretics do exist, however, such as the execution of Avvakum in 1682. Far more typically, the Eastern Orthodox response to a heresy would rather be (and still is) to merely \\"excommunicate\\" the individuals involved. High Middle Ages (800‚Äì1299) and Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance (1300‚Äì1520)  This 1711 illustration for the Index Librorum Prohibitorum depicts the Holy Ghost supplying the book burning fire. From the late 11th century onward, heresy once again came to be a concern for Catholic authorities, as reports became increasingly common. The reasons for this are still not fully understood, but the causes for this new period of heresy include popular response to the 11th- century clerical reform movement, greater lay familiarity with the Bible, exclusion of lay people from sacramental activity, and more rigorous definition and supervision of Catholic dogma. The question of how heresy should be suppressed was not resolved, and there was initially substantial clerical resistance to the use of physical force by secular authorities to correct spiritual deviance. As heresy was viewed with increasing concern by the papacy, however, the \\"secular arm\\" was used more frequently and freely during the 12th century and afterward. =Medieval heresies= There were many Christian sects, cults, movements and individuals throughout the Middle Ages whose teachings were deemed heretical by the established church, such as: *Paulicians ‚Äì an Armenian group (6th to 9th centuries) who sought a return to the purity of the church at the time of Paul the Apostle. *Tondrakians - an Armenian group (9th to 11th centuries) who advocated the abolition of the Church along with all its traditional rites. *Bogomils ‚Äì a group arising in the 11th century in Macedonia and the Balkans who sought a return to the spirituality of the early Christians and opposed established forms of government and church. *Gundolfo ‚Äì an itinerant 11th century preacher near Lille, France, who taught that salvation was achieved through a virtuous life of abandoning the world, restraining the appetites of the flesh, earning food by the labor of hands, doing no injury to anyone, and extending charity to everyone of their own faith. *Cathars ‚Äì a major Christian movement in the Languedoc region of southern France from the 11th to 13th centuries. The Cathars believed that human souls were the spirits of angels trapped within the physical creation of an evil god. Through living a pure and sinless life, the soul could become perfect and free from the snare of matter. *Arnoldists ‚Äì a 12th century group from Lombardy who criticized the wealth of the Catholic Church and preached against baptism and the Eucharist. *Petrobrusians were 12th century followers of Peter of Bruys in southeastern France who rejected the authority of the Church Fathers and of the Catholic Church, opposing clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead and organ music. *Henricans were 12th century followers of Henry of Lausanne in France. They rejected the doctrinal and disciplinary authority of the church, did not recognize any form of worship or liturgy and denied the sacraments. *Waldensians ‚Äì a movement that began in the 12th century in Lyon, France, and still exists today. They held that Apostolic poverty was the way to spiritual perfection and rejected what they perceived as the idolatry of the Catholic Church. *Humiliati - a 12th century group from northern Italy who embraced poverty, charity and mortification. Initially approved by the church, they were suppressed for disobedience in 1571. *Brethren of the Free Spirit ‚Äì a term applied in the 13th century to those, primarily in the Low Countries, Germany, France, Bohemia and northern Italy, who believed that the sacraments were unnecessary for salvation, that the soul could be perfected through imitating the life of Christ, and that the perfected soul was free of sin and beyond all ecclesiastical, moral and secular law. *Apostolic Brethren (later known as Dulcinians) ‚Äì a 13th to 14th century sect from northern Italy founded by Gerard Segarelli and continued by Fra Dolcino of Novara. The Apostolic Brethren rejected the worldliness of the church and sought a life of perfect sanctity, in complete poverty, with no fixed domicile, no care for the morrow, and no vows. *Fraticelli (or Spiritual Franciscans) ‚Äì Franciscan through the 13th to 15th centuries who regarded the wealth of the Church as scandalous. *Neo-Adamites ‚Äì a term applied in the 13th to 15th century to those, including Taborites, Picards and some Beghards, who wished to return to the purity of the life of Adam by living communally, practicing social and religious nudity, embracing free love and rejecting marriage and individual ownership of property. *Nicholas of Basel ‚Äì a 14th century Swiss leader who, after a spiritual experience, taught that he had the authority to use episcopal and priestly powers (even though he was not ordained), that submission to his direction was necessary for attaining spiritual perfection, and that his followers could not sin even though they committed crimes or disobeyed both the Church and pope. *Lollards ‚Äì the 14th century followers of John Wycliffe. They advocated translating the Bible into English, rejected baptism and confession, and denied the doctrine of transubstantiation. =Inquisition= In the late 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church instituted the Inquisition, an official body charged with the suppression of heresy. This began as an extension and more rigorous enforcement of pre-existing episcopal powers (possessed, but little used, by bishops in the early Middle Ages) to inquire about and suppress heresy, but later became the domain of selected Dominicans and Franciscans under the direct power of the Pope. The use of torture to extract confessions was authorized by Innocent IV in 1252. The Inquisition was active in several nations of Europe, particularly where it had fervent support from the civil authority. The Spanish Inquisition was particularly brutal in its methods, which included the burning at the stake of many heretics. However, it was initiated and substantially controlled by King Ferdinand of Spain rather than the Church; King Ferdinand used political leverage to obtain the Church's tacit approval. The Albigensian Crusade (1209‚Äì1229) was part of the Catholic Church's efforts to crush the Cathars. It is linked to the movement now known as the Medieval Inquisition. Another example of a medieval heretic movement is the Hussite movement in the Czech lands in the early 15th century. The last person to be burned alive at the stake on orders from Rome was Giordano Bruno, executed in 1600 for a collection of heretical beliefs including Copernicanism, belief of an unlimited universe with innumerable inhabited worlds, opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the Trinity, divinity of Christ, and Incarnation.  Reformation and Modern Era (1520‚Äìpresent)  Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon, who played an instrumental part in the formation of the Lutheran Churches condemned Johannes Agricola and his doctrine of antinomianism‚Äìthe belief that Christians were free from the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments‚Äìas a heresy. Traditional Lutheranism, espoused by Luther himself, teaches that after justification, \\"the Law of God continued to guide people in how they were to live before God\\". The 39 Articles of the Anglican Communion and the Articles of Religion of the Methodist Churches condemn Pelagianism. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist tradition, harshly criticized antinomianism, considering it the \\"worst of all heresies\\". He taught that Christian believers are bound to follow the moral law for their sanctification. Methodist Christians thus teach the necessity of following the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments, citing Jesus' teaching, \\"If ye love me, keep my commandments\\" (cf. Saint John 14:15). In the 17th century, Jansenism, which taught the doctrine of predestination, was regarded by the Catholic Church as a heresy; it concerned the Jesuits in particular. The text Augustinus, which propagated Jansenist beliefs, was repudiated by the Holy See. In Testem benevolentiae nostrae, issued on 22 January 1899, Pope Leo XIII condemned as heresy, Americanism, \\"the rejection of external spiritual direction as no longer necessary, the extolling of natural over supernatural virtues, the preference of active over passive virtues, the rejection of religious vows as not compatible with Christian liberty, and the adoption of a new method of apologetics and approach to non-Catholics.\\" Cardinal James Gibbons responded to Pope Leo XIII that no educated Catholic Christian in the United States subscribed to these condemned doctrines. =Last execution of a heretic= During the 1519 Leipzig Debate prior to his excommunication, then- Catholic priest Martin Luther made comments against burning heretics which were later summarized as \\"Haereticos comburi est contra voluntatem Spiritus\\" (It is contrary to the Spirit to burn heretics). This summary was specifically censured in the 1520 papal bull Exsurge Domine., pp. 145‚Äì147. When he failed to accept the bull and give a broad recantation of his writings, he was excommunicated in the subsequent 1521 papal bull Decet Romanum Pontificem. The censuring of this statement was controversial even at the time because this had previously been a freely debated idea which had not resulted in charges of heresy. The last case of an execution by the inquisition was that of the schoolmaster Cayetano Ripoll, accused of deism by the waning Spanish Inquisition and hanged on 26 July 1826 in Valencia after a two-year trial. Eight years later in 1834, Spain, the last remaining government to still be providing the Catholic Church with the right to pronounce and effect capital punishment, formally withdrew that right from the Church. The era of such absolute Church authority had lasted some 1,449 years, from AD 385 through to 1834. The number of people executed as heretics as sentenced by various church authorities is not known; however it most certainly numbers into the several thousands. Coincidentally, the first heretic executed had been a Spaniard, Priscillian; the most notorious organization known for the persecution of heretics had been based in Spain, the Spanish Inquisition, and the last heretic executed had been a Spaniard, Cayetano Ripoll. Thus, the era of the execution of heretics by the Catholic Church had come to an end. Modern Roman Catholic response to Protestantism Well into the 20th century, Catholics defined Protestants as heretics. Thus, Hilaire Belloc, in his time one of the most conspicuous speakers for Catholicism in Britain, was outspoken about the \\"Protestant heresy\\". He even defined Islam as being \\"a Christian heresy\\", on the grounds that Muslims accept many of the tenets of Christianity but deny the divinity of Christ. However, in the second half of the century, and especially in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church, in the spirit of ecumenism, tended to diminish the effects of Protestantism as a formal heresy by referring to many Protestants who, as material heretics, \\"through no fault of their own do not know Christ and his Church\\",CCC 847 even though the teachings of Protestantism are indeed formally heretical from a Catholic perspective. Modern usage in ecumenical contexts favors referring to Protestants as \\"separated brethren\\". Some of the doctrines of Protestantism that the Catholic Church considers heretical are the belief that the Bible is the only supremely authoritative source and rule of faith and practice in Christianity (sola scriptura), that only by faith alone can anyone ever be lead to salvation and not by works (sola fide), that the Pope does not necessarily have universal jurisdiction over the whole Church by any divine right, that the Catholic Church cannot be \\"the sole Church of Christ\\", and that there is not a sacramental and ministerial priesthood exclusively received by ecclesiastical ordination, but rather that the only Christian priesthood can be a universal priesthood of all believers.Protestantism See also *Catholic teachings on heresy *Christian heresy in the modern era *History of Christianity *Infallibility of the Church *List of movements declared heretical by the Catholic Church *List of people burned as heretics *Pelagius *Diversity in early Christian theology  Notes   References  = Citations = = Sources = * Further reading  Category:Christian terminology ","title":"Heresy in Christianity"},{"id":"9425441","text":"Aaron Hunt (born June 19, 1980, in Denison, Texas) is a professional Canadian football defensive tackle who most recently played for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League.

Studios and offices are on Joy Drive in South Burlington. The transmitter is located off Church Hill Road in Charlotte. History WIZN signed on the air in October, 1983, owned by Radio Vergennes, Inc. The station began broadcasting from the Stevens House in Vergennes, with an original line up of DJs Artie Lavigne, Russ Kinsley, Joel Bolton, Mary L. Collins, and Bill Henk. Lavigne served as the president and general manager. Kinsley was also the program director and music director. WIZN was a local album rock station in the Vergennes area, powered at only 710 watts on a Class A regional frequency, 106.3 MHz. By the late 1980s, the station increased power to its current 50,000 watts, and changed its dial position to 106.7, making it a Class C station. The power boost gave WIZN coverage of Burlington, Vermont's largest city, and much of the Champlain Valley. But it kept its original rock format and ownership for several decades. From the late 1990s until 2005, WIZN was the region's longtime home of The Howard Stern Show before Stern left radio syndication and moved to Sirius XM Radio. In 2005, Hall Communications paid $17 million for WIZN. Hall moved the station from a mix of contemporary and classic rock to all classic rock, while co-owned 99.9 WBTZ concentrates on younger rock fans, airing an alternative rock format.

It is located southeast of Roanoke, and southwest of Lynchburg. Smaller and lower than Smith Mountain Lake, Leesville Lake covers and contains of water at full pond. The lake is long with around of shoreline. The reservoir lies in a broad valley nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of rural southwestern Virginia of the Appalachian chain. Before the lake's creation, farming and logging were the primary industries. Power generation Initial proposals were made in the late 1920s to dam the Roanoke River and the Blackwater River at the Smith Mountain gorge to generate electricity. Construction of the Smith Mountain Dam began in 1960 and was completed in 1963. The dam produces hydro- electric power mostly during hours of peak demand on the American Electric Power system. Water passes from Smith Mountain Lake through generators to Leesville Lake, producing power. In times of low demand, the generators are used as pumps to reverse the flow and return the water to Smith Mountain Lake. This takes advantage of the more or less constant output of steam generation plants in off-peak periods. In its partnership role with Smith Mountain Lake generating power, Leesville Lake has a maximum refill rate of per hour and a maximum drawdown rate of per hour. Normal fluctuation consists of on average with an absolute maximum of , allowing Leesville Lake to avoid the drastic drawdowns of other area lakes. Recreation and development Since the 1960s, the area around Leesville Lake has remained relatively rural and remote with mostly corn, tobacco, small family farms and other agriculture. The limited early residential developments around the lake consisted largely of family farms. Since about 2004, however, residential growth has begun to expand rather quickly and lakefront homes and communities now dot the shoreline. Boat traffic on the lake remains low relative to nearby Smith Mountain Lake, Kerr Lake and Lake Gaston. Leesville Lake is becoming a popular recreational area. Fishing is very popular, especially for striped bass. The state record striped bass was caught out of Leesville Lake in 2000. Boating, water skiing, wakeboarding, and riding personal watercraft are also common activities. Access to Leesville Lake is primarily by way of U.S. Route 29, although State Route 43 and State Route 40 provide access to the north and south sides of the lake, respectively.

HMS Sussex sank according to the Julian calendar, still used in England at that time, on 19 February 1693/4. off Gibraltar. On board were possibly 10 tons of gold coins. This could now be worth more than $500 million, including the bullion and antiquity values, making it one of the most valuable wrecks ever. Sussex was launched at Chatham Dockyard on 11 April 1693, and was the pride of the Royal Navy. As the flagship of Admiral Sir Francis Wheler,The surname is sometimes spelled Wheeler. she set sail from Portsmouth on 27 December 1693, escorting a fleet of 48 warships and 166 merchant ships to the Mediterranean. > 'Nov. 22.

Admiralty Entry Book 1, p. 84. Calendar of State Papers Domestic: > William and Mary, 1693. After a short stopover in Cadiz, the fleet entered the Mediterranean. On 27 February a violent storm hit the flotilla near the Strait of Gibraltar and in the early morning of the third day, Sussex sank. All but two \\"Turks\\" of the 500 crew on board drowned, including Admiral Wheler, whose body, legend has it, was found on the eastern shore of the rock of Gibraltar in his night- shirt. Due to the extent of the fatalities, it was not possible to establish the exact cause of the disaster, but it has been noted that 'the disaster seemed to confirm suspicions already voiced about the inherent instability of 80-gun ships with only two decks, such as the Sussex, and a third deck would be added for new ships of this armament.'C. S. Knighton, 'Wheler, Sir Francis (c.1656‚Äì1694)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 February 2007. Besides Sussex, 12 other ships of the fleet sank. There were approximately 1,200 casualties in total, in what remains one of the worst disasters in the history of the Royal Navy.  Treasure hunt Between 1998 and 2001, the American Company Odyssey Marine Exploration searched for the Sussex and claimed that it had located the shipwreck at a depth of 800 metres (2,624 feet). In October 2002, Odyssey agreed to a deal with the ship's rightful owner, the British government, on a formula for sharing any potential spoils. Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest. The Americans were then poised to start the excavation in 2003, but it was delayed amid a raft of complaints from some archaeological quarters, denouncing it as a dangerous precedent for the \\"ransacking\\" of shipwrecks by private firms under the aegis of archaeological research. Just as Odyssey was about to start an excavation, it was stopped by the Spanish authorities, in particular the government of Andalusia in January 2006. In March 2007, Andalusia gave assent for the excavation to start with the condition that Spanish archeologists would take part in the excavation in order to ascertain that the shipwreck to be excavated is indeed the Sussex and not a Spanish galleon.En busca del tesoro del 'HMS Sussex' ¬∑ ELPA√çS.com On the same day, Odyssey Marine sent one of its survey vessels from Gibraltar, west of Cadiz to begin its Black Swan Project, which has resulted in Spain taking action against the company and cancelling its agreement to cooperate on the Sussex project.

It is a subsidiary of Arriva. The company operates services in West Sussex and Surrey, as part of the Arriva Southern Counties division. Services are run primarily centred on hubs at Guildford, Woking and Cranleigh. History Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Dorking, en route to Guildford in July 2009 Arriva Guildford & West Surrey's main bus depot in Guildford Buses in the Guildford area had been operated since the pre-war period by the expanding private operator Aldershot & District Traction. In the late 1960s as part of the process of nationalisation, this company became a subsidiary of the National Bus Company (UK) National Bus Company (NB). In the early 1970s the subsidiary was renamed, becoming part of the enlarged Alder Valley NBC subsidiary. In preparation for the deregulation of bus services, services in the area passed to a smaller NBC subsidiary, Alder Valley South. This company was privatised in 1987, and rebranded itself Alder Valley once more. The Guildford & West Surrey brand name was first created in 1990, when the Guildford operations of the new Alder Valley company were sold to London & Country, becoming a part of that company. London & Country at the time was owned by the Drawlane Group, one of the predecessor companies of Arriva. London & Country itself was a rebranding of the privatised London Country South West NBC subsidiary. Buses in the area began wearing the Guildford & West Surrey fleet name and livery in the style of the new London & Country colours,Image of a Guildford and West Surrey branded London & Country double decker busImage of a Guildford and West Surrey branded London & Country single decker bus although London & Country branded buses also operated in the areaImage of a London & Country double decker bus in Guildford The company was renamed Arriva Guildford & West Surrey Ltd in 2001 with the launch of the Arriva corporate brand, with buses being repainted into the corporate livery, initially with the strapline serving Surrey and West Sussex. The company was later incorporated into the Arriva Southern Counties division, dropping the strapline, and trading as Arriva Southern Counties.Arriva official site Southern Counties history page, accessed 11 September 2008 On 7 March 2007, the Arriva West Sussex licence (operating buses from a depot in Horsham) was not continued, with the vehicles at Horsham transferring to the Arriva Guildford & West Surrey licence. However, it was announced in September 2009 that the Horsham operations would be sold to Metrobus, with all routes transferring to Crawley depot (the Horsham depot at Warnham being left unused). All staff and 19 single-decker buses were transferred to Metrobus from 3 October 2009. Arriva maintain a presence in Horsham through hourly service 63 (Guildford - Horsham), which is operated by Cranleigh depot, though it was amended to remove a local section of route in Horsham. Operating area The company operates in parts of West Sussex as well as Surrey. The route network is centred on hubs at Guildford, Woking with Cranleigh and Dorking acting as smaller hubs. Services also reach the towns of Redhill in the East, Weybridge in the north east, Horsham in the south east and Camberley in the west.arrivabus.co.uk - area map of Surrey and West Sussex services Accessed 11 September 2008 Guildford park and ride One of five Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse Urbans used on the Guildford park and ride.

Arriva operated part of the Guildford park and ride service for Surrey County Council.Surrey County Council - \\"Guildford town park and ride\\" Arriva ran the services from: *Spectrum Lesiure Centre: Route 100 (Monday - Friday) *Artington: Route 200 (Monday - Saturday) Previously, a Saturday-only service from the Allianz Cornhill offices at Ladymead (numbered 101) ran instead of the Spectrum Leisure Centre car park on Saturdays because the Spectrum car park is too small for use as both a park and ride site and leisure centre purposes on a Saturday. However, the Ladymead service ended on 26 March 2011, following a Surrey CC spending cut, leaving no park and ride service from the North on Saturdays. Surrey CC advise passengers to use either Merrow or Artington as a replacement, but as these are on different approaches to the town they do not provide very good replacements. A regular bus service to the Spectrum still runs on Saturdays for users of the Spectrum but park and ride travel is not permitted. The Merrow site (route 300) which opened in 2008 serves approaches from the east of Guildford, this service was run by Safeguard Coaches. In addition to the three main sites, Surrey County Council also promote use of University of Surrey Car Park 3 as park and ride service on Saturdays, using normal Arriva routes 3, 17, 26, 27, 36 and 37.

In addition, the route is operated using specially branded Mercedes Benz single-decker buses, a fleet of three Citaros. Despite being 56 registered, the buses are only Euro III-engined and have the old style fronts. The route used to run past Woking on to Guildford, on an indirect route via Send village, and also did not serve Weybridge, terminating at a retail centre near the circuit. Arriva later withdrew the Guildford to Woking section (replaced in part by Countryliner Coaches), and extended the route to Weybridge. Liveries route 465, at the foot of Box Hill Most buses in the fleet are painted in either the previous standard Arriva UK bus livery of aquamarine with a large cotswold stone swoop at the front, or the newer \\"interurban\\" livery with a blue skirt and smaller \\"cow's horn\\" at the front, rather than a large swoop. Arriva changed its policy in 2009, making the previous \\"interurban\\" livery the standard livery, and since then repaints and new deliveries have been going into this livery. As of July 2011 there are slightly more buses in interurban livery than the old livery. Special liveries include the three Mercedes-Benz Citaros used on route 436, which wear a blue and silver scheme in the style of the old Arriva livery, with a base metallic silver and a blue swoop. The Guildford park and ride buses were painted into a purple based oak leaf livery in the first part of 2011, matching the branding used by Surrey County Council for park and ride services. Previously, the buses were painted in the same oak leaf style but in a variety of different base colours: Lime green (representing spring), dark green (summer), blue (winter), brown (autumn) and pink (spare). As per Transport for London contract stipulations, the buses used on London Buses route 465 carried the all over London red version of the Arriva livery, as used by Arriva London, although this livery no longer features in the fleet after Horsham depot was sold to Metrobus along with operation of route 465. Red London livery saw a brief reprieve in April 2011 when two Mini Pointer Darts were temporarily drafted in to Guildford depot after routes were taken on from Countryliner at short notice. Five of the six Enviro200 Darts carry route branding for service 91, and a handful of DAF SB120s have route branding for routes 34/5. Various Darts have orange based branding for University of Surrey routes, and a pair of Darts also carry branding for the 42/44. In 2006, as was done in other Arriva locations, Arriva painted one its buses in a centenary livery reminiscent of Aldershot & District company. The bus has since re-gained standard livery. A new livery and logo was introduced nationally in 2018 and many buses are currently being repainted Depots Guildford is the location of the main bus garage of the company, an outstation was maintained at Cranleigh before being closed in 2011.

There are couple of examples with Pointer 2 bodywork. Making up the other main part of the fleet are DAF SB120/Wright Cadets. A batch arrived in 2001 for Surrey Hills routes, followed by another batch in 2002 for routes 34 and 35. 5 Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse Urbans were bought in 2004 for Guildford park and ride services. Another newer VDL SB120/Wright Cadet arrived in 2006, (3970) diverted from an order for Arriva Yorkshire, to replace a 2002 example burnt out. Later that year 3 Mercedes-Benz Citaros arrived for route 436 to Mercedes-Benz World. In early 2009 a fleet of six Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Darts were put into service on route 91. In mid-2009, the final two Dennis Dominators with East Lancs bodywork at Guildford (part of the last batch ever built), were transferred to Maidstone, replaced by two Volvo B7TL/Alexander ALX400s, displaced from Gillingham. A Volvo Olympian/Northern Counties Palatine, which was Horsham's double decker, operated from Guildford for a while after Horsham's depot's sale, before moving on to Cranleigh as it is on the 43/45 School .

The aircraft, with 33 passengers and 5 crew members aboard, had just arrived from Gwadar International Airport, Balochistan, and was set to land in Hyderabad Airport, Sindh. The hijackers demanded that the aircraft be flown to New Delhi, India. The Army's Special Service Group's Haideri Company, 7th Commando Zarrar Battalion, SSG Division, accompanied by members of the Pakistan Rangers, stormed the aircraft, while the Pakistan Police surrounded the plane. The operation concluded with all three hijackers arrested and sentenced to death by Pakistan, with no casualties.  Hijacking of PIA Aircraft  The incident began while the aircraft was flying, carrying 33 passengers with 5 crew members abroad. The Karachi-bound PIA Fokker Aircraft, Flight PK-554, was hijacked shortly after it took off from Gwadar at 5:35pm on 25 May 1998. The hijackers forced the pilot to fly towards New Delhi, India. Hijacker's demands The hijackers had initially asked the pilot to veer the plane towards New Delhi. But, the pilot refused to head towards Delhi on the pretext of fuel shortage and Pakistan Air Force jets had intercepted the aircraft as well. The drama started when the PIA pilot, Captain Uzair Khan, called the Hyderabad Airport general manager after being hijacked. His message addressed Hyderabad Airport as Bhuj Airport, and led the hijackers to believe that they were in Bhuj, India, as he had heard the hijackers talking about maps of Bhuj. The Hyderabad airport staff started pretending to be from Bhuj airport and told the pilot that they were waiting for the plane to land. This communication assured the hijackers that the plane had crossed into India. Hijackers The three hijackers were identified as Shahsawar Baloch, Sabir Baloch and Shabir Baloch. They were traveling under the names of Jamal Hussain, Anwer Hussain and Ghulam Hussain. Timeline =The Siege of Flight 544= The plane landed at Hyderabad late at night. The airport manager had switched off the lights and markings of Hyderabad. Later in the night, the hijackers released flight engineer Sajjad Chaudhry to talk to the authorities to refuel the plane for an onward journey to New Delhi, India. The standoff came to an end after seven hours of continuous negotiations led by senior officials of the Pakistan Police. The officials included Senior Superintendent of Police Akhtar Gorchani, Assistant Superintendent of Police Usman Anwar, Deputy Commissioner & District Magistrate Hyderabad Sohail Akbar Shah and Pakistan Rangers Major Aamir Hashmi, at 3 am on Monday. The hijackers demanded food, water, and fuel for the aircraft. =Preparation for the Attack= The entire airport was cordoned off by rangers and army personnel. The commandos belonging to the Haideri Company, 7th Commando Zarrar Battalion, SSG Division had been put on alert for a possible storming of the plane. All airport lights had been switched off and the road links to the airport were sealed. In order to deliver water and food, Pakistan police Gorchani and Anwar volunteered and thus police managed to reach the plane, though unarmed. While the officers stayed in the plane to distract the hijackers, the Special Service Group prepared for the mission. In the meantime, the officers spoke Hindi to each other and convinced the hijackers that they were Indian nationals, as the hijackers had thought that they were in an Indian airport. The two hijackers who identified themselves as Sabir and Shabbir had come out with hand bombs tied on their bodies. The police officers, in order to buy time and earn good will, told the hijackers that the Pakistani embassy people had been summoned to talk to them but, at the same time insisted that they should not hurt the passengers and let the women and children go. =Final Assault= The concluding part of the drama started when the hijackers allowed the women, two infants and a child to disembark following negotiations with Anwar, who met them as \\"Assistant Airport Manager\\" Ram and Gorchani posing himself as Ashok, manager of the Bhuj Airport. Deputy Commissioner Sohail Akbar Shah, joined the team as DC Rajhastan and communicated with the remaining officers in Hindi. The women and children were evacuated from the aircraft while the officers had remained in the plane. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army had assigned the mission of Haideri Company, 7th Commando Zarrar Battalion, SSG Division, led by Major Tariq Ahmad Anees and Major Aamir Saleem, codenamed \\"Commando Operation\\". By midnight, the elite members SSG had arrived on the scene. They had begun to launch the full-scale operation to retrieve the terrorists. The Pakistan police, ranger and army vehicles were parked in front of the aircraft to prevent it from flying again. The SSG commandos had taken their positions. The SSG stormed the plane, penetrating it from the front and the back doors of the aircraft. The Deputy Commissioner of Police had said Alla ho Akbar (God is great) simultaneously, when the SSG had stormed the plane. Shocked by the slogan, one of the hijackers tried to shoot the deputy commissioner but missed, and the hijacker mistakenly fired at one of his accomplices. The operation lasted less than two minutes. All three hijackers were arrested by the SSG and rushed to Karachi where they were handed over to the Pakistan Police. Investigation The hijackers were said to be carrying small weapons - pistols or revolvers, although they showed some packets which they claimed were high intensity explosives. The interrogations revealed that the Baloch hijackers were opposed to nuclear testing in their native Balochistan province following the recent Indian nuclear testing. It was later revealed that hijackers had demanded refueling to proceed to New Delhi. During the siege, the Corps Commander of V Corps, Chief Secretary, Home Secretary, and IG police were at the airport. Aftermath The Sindh Governor Lieutenant-General (retired) Moinuddin Haider remained in touch with the authorities throughout the siege. The following week, he honored the Sindh police officers with highest honors and gallantry awards. The hijackers were convicted under 402-B (hijacking code defined in Pakistani law) in 1998 and were given the death penalty in 1999. All hijackers were hanged on 28 May 2015, after 17 years to the day when Pakistan had successfully conducted their nuclear tests in Chaghi, Baluchistan.

The small state of Kerala is on the South Western coast of India. In the 1st century, Thomas the Apostle arrived there to preach the gospel to the Jewish community. Some local residents became followers of Jesus of Nazareth; they were known as Nasrani people and their church as the Malankara Church. They followed a unique Hebrew-Syriac Christian tradition which included several Jewish elements and Indian customs. The Reformist faction split from the Malankara Syrian Church. Thithoos Mar Thoma was the Metropolitan of the Reformist faction, which later chose the name Marthoma Syrian Church of Malabar, now popularly known as the Mar Thoma Church. This church remained completely independent.  Early days  = Palakunnathu Family = In the 17th century, a member of the Panamkuzhy family (a branch of the Pakalomattam family), came and settled in Kozhencherry on the banks of river Pampa. Later they moved to Maramon, and lived at Chackkalyil, on the other side of the river. The second son in that family, Mathen moved to a nearby house at Palakunnathu. He had six sons and a daughter. The daughter was married to Mallapally Pavoothikunnel family and the first four sons moved to Themoottil, Neduvelil (Kozhenchery), Periyilel, and Punamadom (Othera). The fifth son was a hermit priest (sanyasi achen). As was the custom, the youngest son Mathew lived at Palakunnathu family house, which still exists. Abraham Malpan, leader of reformation in Malankara church, was the second son of Mathew. Thomas Mar Athanasius Metropolitan and Titus I Mar Thoma Metropolitan (Mar Thoma Metropolitan I) were the sons of Abraham Malpan. A number of other Marthoma Church leaders were also born in this family. Mathews Mar Athanasius Metropolitan and Titus II Mar Thoma Metropolitan (Mar Thoma Metropolitan XV) were from this family. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan (Mar Thoma Metropolitan XXI), head of the Marthoma Church , is also from this family.Cherian Cherian. Maramon Pakalomattom Chackalyil Kudumba Charitram. (Family History of Maramon Pakalomattom Chackalyil).N. M. Mathew, History of Palakunnathu Family. = Early age = Dethos (Aramaic. Titus ‚Äì English) was born on 20 February 1843, the youngest son of Abraham Malpan and Thumpamon Thondamvelil Mariamma. He was baptized by Mathews Mar Athanasius Metropolitan at the Maramon church. After primary education at Maramon he joined Kottayam seminary. He joined C.M.S. College, Kottayam and then left for higher studies in Madras. =Ordination= IN 1867, Dethos was ordained as a priest by Mathews Mar Athanasius Metropolitan at Maramon church and was appointed as the assistant vicar of that church. He was a fiery speaker.Chacko T.C. Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charithra Samgraham. (Concise History of Marthoma Church), Page 168 During that period a prayer meeting organized at the home of a parishioner later became the Maramon Convention. Consecration =Enthronement= Thomas Mar Athanasius, died in August 1893 without consecrating a successor. Most of the churches were under the control of Bava faction. Being a member of the Palakunnathu family and the next hierarchical person the name of Dethos Kathanar was proposed. He accepted, under the condition that all the parishes agreed to this suggestion. Once it was accepted, parish leaders decided to have the consecration at Kottayam Cheriya palli where Thazhathu Punnathra Chandapilla Kathanar was the vicar. On Thursday 18 January 1894, Dethos Kathanar was consecrated by head of the Malabar Independent Syrian Church, Youseph Mar Athanasius (Maliyekkal) (1888‚Äì1898) and by Geevarghese Mar Koorilose (Karumamkuzhy) Suffragan Metropolitan.http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp- kerala/former-metropolitans-death-anniversary-to-be- observed/article2539716.ece He was given the episcopal title Thithoos Mar Thoma Metropolitan. (English: Titus Mar Thoma Metropolitan).Varughese, Rev. K.C., '‚ÄôMalabar Swathanthra Suryani Sabhyude Charitram'‚Äô (History of the Malankar Independednt Suryani Church). Page 82 Administration =Participation by laity= In early ages, only clergy were included as advisers to the Metropolitan. After that, they were also included in all decision-making committees. When Titus Mar Thoma took charge of the church, there was only a clergy committee to take the important decisions. Metropolitan wanted democratic principles to be applied in all decision makings. So after consultation with the clergy committee, a Managing Committee (now known as Sabha Council) and a Representative Assembly (now known as Prathinidhi Mandalam) were set up. Both these committees included all the bishops and representatives of clergy and parishes. The first Managing committee included 7 clergy and five laity. The first meeting of these committees was held in 1896.Mathew, N. M. Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram, (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume II, pp. 155‚Äì157. =Other reforms= A constitution for the Church was prepared and approved by the Representative Assembly and by the Managing Committee. Vaideeka Selection committee for selecting laity for ordination as clergy was instituted. Qurbana Thaksa (Holy communion liturgy) ‚Äì improvements were made to the liturgy to fall in line with the reformation ideals. (The Syriac word Qurbana is cognate with the Hebrew word Korban) =Educational institutions= Kottayam Marthoma Seminary School (1896), Tiruvalla S.C. Seminary High School (1902), were opened. It paved the way for the opening of a number of primary schools in a number of parishes. This improved the conditions of the villages and towns in Kerala. =Missionary work= Missionary efforts began around Kottayam and then expanded to North Travancore. By 1909 it spread outside Kerala. Sunday School Samajam began on 1905 =Maramon Convention= But Mar Thoma had to face a number of problems. Due to the lack of a firm doctrinal position, many false teachings of other denominations crept into the church. By 1894, A number of small prayer groups were forming in the churches for spiritual reaffirmation inside the community and this was followed into a big revival. These regular meetings later took place in parishes. Because the number of people attending these meetings was growing it was brought to the attention of the Bishop and was decided to have a common meeting for these communions organized at an accessible central place. The duty of leading and organizing this meeting was given to the Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association and the first convention was held in 1895 at Maramon. This was the beginning of the Maramon Convention. Parishes The litigation which began in 1879 and ended in 1889 was only for the Malankara Church properties. But the parish properties belonged to the individual parishes. So each parish had to go again with separate litigation to possess their parish properties.for more information refer Mathew, N. M. Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram, (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume III, pp. 172‚Äì220. Parishes (church and their properties) that remained with the Marthoma church during the reformation: Elanthoor Valia palli, Kumbanad Valia Palli, Koorthamala Palli (Kareelamukku, Koipram), Kottarakara palli, Paryaram pazhya palli, Thalavady West. After civil cases, the following churches and its properties were under Mar Thoma church but lost hold along time: Manarcaud palli, Puthencavu palli. Important churches that Mar Thoma won the earlier court cases, but lost in the final verdict: Arthat palli and St. George Orthodox Church, Puthuppally. Consecration of a successor Rev. P. J. Dethos was selected by the Representative Assembly at Mavelikara to be consecrated as a bishop to assist Metropolitan. Dethos Kathanar was consecrated on 9 December 1898 at Puthenkavu church by Titus Mar Thoma Metropolitan with the assistance of Geevarghese Mar Koorilose Metropolitan (Karumamkuzhi) of Malabar Independent Syrian Church. He was given the episcopal title Thithoos Dwitheeyan Mar Thoma Metropolitan, Titus II Mar Thoma. Safe in His arms Titus I Mar Thoma Metropolitan escaped from great dangers on two occasions. The first one was in March 1907 S.C. The Seminary school building at Tiruvalla was under construction. Mar Thoma was living in a temporary thatched shed. During the time the house caught on fire at about night. Mar Thoma was able to notice and save himself and his helpers from there. The second one was in June 1907. It was pouring heavily, Mar Thoma was living in the balcony of Maramon church. Suddenly the whole church except the balcony crashed. It is important to note that such events historically are not new to bishops of St. Thomas Church. Last days Metropolitan was suffering from diabetes for a long time. He died on 20 October 1909 and was entombed at Tiruvalla church. The funeral service was conducted by Titus II Mar Thoma in the presence of Vicar General Ipe Thoma Kathanar and a large crowd.

The shed is created to make it easy to interlace the weft into the warp and thus create woven fabric. Most types of looms have some sort of device which separates some of the warp threads from the others. This separation is called the shed, and allows for a shuttle carrying the weft thread to move through the shed perpendicular to the warp threads. Which threads are raised and which are lowered are changed after each pass of the shuttle. The process of weaving can be simplified to a series of four steps: the shed is raised, the shuttle is passed through, the shed is closed, and the weft thread is beaten into place. These steps are then repeated, with a different set of threads being raised so as to interlace the warp and weft. The term shedding refers to the action of creating a shed. A shedding device is the device used to raise or open the shed. Creating the separation is referred to as raising or opening the shed, while the reverse is known as lowering or closing the shed.  Shedding device  Inkle loom The type of device that is used to raise and lower the shed differs on the type of loom. With a tablet loom the sheds are raised and lowered by rotating the tablets, or cards. In a floor loom the shed is created by the harnesses. Inkle looms have one of the more primitive shedding devices, where there is one set of heddles and the shed is created by hand. backstrap loom with a shed-rod. Originally there was no shed, and the weft was inserted into the warp by picking the warp threads up individually, as is done in tapestry weaving. After each weft thread is woven the warp threads had to be picked out and lifted again, which made the process slow. To speed up the process various devices were developed to create a reproducible shed, so that the weft could be passed between the separated threads, and so the threads would not have to be separated individually each time. The first type of shedding device was called a shed-rod. It was a rod inserted into the warp to ease in weaving, and came about at the same time as the heddle. Threads were alternated over and under the rod, and the threads that went under the rod went through string heddles attached to a bar. The shed was created in two ways:by raising the shed-rod, and by lifting the heddles. The shed-rod was an invention of eastern origin, and was introduced to Europe via Egypt in the first century AD. The Romans used it for both plain weave and twill. After the shed-rod came the rigid heddle loom, where the shed is created by raising or lowering the rigid heddle. As the loom progressed, the shed-rod was replaced by a second set of heddles, for a total of two shafts with heddles. Eventually looms like the modern floor loom were developed, where there are many shafts which can be raised to create the shed.  Rising shed loom  Two different shedding methods were developed for the harness loom-one where any one harness or combination of harnesses was lifted while the other harnesses remained stationary. This type of loom is known as a rising shed loom, and examples include the table loom, dobby loom or the Jack loom. The other method used in harness looms is where some harnesses are raised while others are lowered. The second method lessened the effort of lifting the selected harnesses because they no longer needed to be raised as high as in a rising shed loom. Counterbalance and countermarch looms are of this second type.  Poor shed  There are many things that can cause the warp threads not to separate cleanly, and thus produce a poor shed. A slack warp, threads set too closely in the reed, or increase of friction on the first foot or so of the warp where the threads were handled all cause poor sheds. Fuzzy yarns like mohair can also cause a poor shed. To get a better shed the weaver can lift the harnesses while the reed is against the fabric, or raise only one harness at a time. By weaving in a different manner sometimes a good shed can be created. The weaver can also insert a stick into the shed to clear it, and make way for the shuttle though this option is time-consuming.

The company was founded in 2001, and produced physical layer ICs used in 10GE line cards and optical modules (such as XENPAK, SFP, XFP). Aeluros was the first to produce a XAUI transceiver dissipating less than 1 Watt of power, a transceiver that can drive directly a 10 Gbit/s VCSEL, and a transceiver with integrated Electronic Dispersion Compensation for 10GE using Multi-mode optical fiber. Aeluros merged with NetLogic Microsystems in October 2007 in a deal exceeding $70M. Netlogic Microsystems was subsequently acquired by Broadcom in February 2012 for $3.7B.

Cooper Elementary School, usually called Cooper School, serves students from kindergarten through 5th grade. Located in the Pigeon Point neighborhood of Delridge, Seattle, Washington, it is part of the Seattle Public Schools district. The school's site is immediately adjacent to the West Duwamish Greenbelt, one of Seattle's largest wildlife habitat corridors. This rich natural environment enhances the school's environmental education program. While the current building, located at 1901 SW Genesee Street, was opened in 1999, Cooper School enjoys a long history in the community, dating back to 1906, when a group of 70 students, children of steel mill workers, attended classes at Youngstown School in a small building offered by the Seattle Steel Company. A year later, a wooden building‚Äîknown as Riverside School: Cooper; Archived 2008-01-17 on the Internet Archive.‚Äîwas built for the school at the base of Pigeon Hill. As the population of the community grew, the wooden structure was replaced by a brick building 1917, which was designed by Edgar Blair, with a 1929 expansion designed by Floyd Naramore. In 1939, the school was renamed to honor Frank B. Cooper, a former Seattle school superintendent. The historic Youngstown School building, located at 4408 Delridge Way SW, now houses the Cooper Artist Housing and Youngstown Cultural Arts Center. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.Seattle, Washington: Frank B. Cooper Elementary School, National Park Service, Women's History Month pages, 2004. Accessed online 16 September 2007. One of the school's assets is its diversity. Approximately 80 percent of Cooper students are racial or ethnic minorities and approximately one-quarter are bilingual. The first African American teacher hired to teach in Seattle Public Schools, Thelma Dewitty, worked at Cooper School from 1947 until 1953. The Thelma DeWitty Theater at the Youngstown Cultural Arts Center is named after her. On Thursday January 29, 2009 the Seattle School Board voted to close Cooper Elementary School and move the Pathfinder K-8 program to the Cooper campus.

The studio has produced and distributed the vast majority of Albanian films. Especially important was its work in the 1970s and 1980s when the studio averaged 75‚Äì80 movies per year. History The Centre of Cinematography was established in 1945 as the Agency of Albanian Films () and in 1947 it was transformed into the Albanian Cinematographical National Company (). At that time all the movie theatres were nationalised, so the company was in charge of both movie production and management of theatres. In May 1948 the company presented its first cinematographic chronicle. It also contributed in the 1940s and 1950s with the building of many movie theatres throughout Albania. In 1952, the movie studio called \\"Albania National Centre of Cinematography\\", was created, which lasted until 1992, and was replaced by the Albafilm-Tirana (1992‚Äì1996). In 1996 the current National Center of Cinematography was created by a government decree. Filmography =1940s= *1 Maj 1949 (1949) ... Distributor =1950s= *Drit√´ mbi Shqip√´ri (1958) ...

Megas in Folktales of Greece.Georgios A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, p 158, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 It is Aarne-Thompson type 875 and has many Greek and Slavic variants, generally revolving about the exchange of clever answers.Georgios A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, p 240, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 This type of tale is the commonest European tale dealing with witty exchanges.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 158-9, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 In ballad form, the clever answers to the riddles, and the winning of a husband by them, are found in Child ballad 1, Riddles Wisely Expounded.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 1, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Synopsis Two brothers argued over how they should split their land, some of which was good and some bad. The king sent riddles to them: whoever guessed the riddles would get good land. The first riddle was what was the fastest thing in the world. The stupid brother's daughter told him what to say; his brother guessed a bird or a horse, and the stupid brother said the mind. The second riddle was what was the heaviest thing in the world; the clever brother guessed stone or iron, and the stupid brother repeated his daughter's answer: fire because no one could lift it. The third was what was the most important thing in the world; the clever brother guessed bread or money, and the stupid brother repeated his daughter's answer: ground, because they needed it to stand on. The king gave the stupid brother the land and asked how he got the answers. He confessed it was his daughter. The king married the daughter, on the condition that she never meddled in his affairs; if she did, she would have to return home, although he would give her one thing, whatever she valued most in the castle. One day, the queen saw a man steal a packsaddle and quarrel with the rightful owner. She called out which was the rightful owner, and the king said she had meddled and must go home. She asked him to eat one last meal with her, and then she drugged it. When he was asleep, she put him in the carriage and went home. When the king woke, she told him she was entitled to him, because she valued him most of everything in the castle. The king took her back to the castle and gave her the right to judge all his affairs.

Burgess and Tim Shallice. It is composed of two tests, the Hayling Sentence Completion Test and the Brixton Spatial Awareness Test.  The Hayling Sentence Completion Test  The Hayling Sentence Completion test is a measure of response initiation and response suppression. It consists of two sets of 15 sentences each having the last word missing. In the first section the examiner reads each sentence aloud and the participant has to simply complete the sentences, yielding a simple measure of response initiation speed.The second part of the Hayling requires participants to complete a sentence with a nonsense ending word (and suppress a sensible one), giving measures of response suppression ability and thinking time. This test is entirely spoken and is thus suitable for people with a wide range of problems such as those involving reading, visual perception, or movement. It takes approximately five minutes to administer yet yields three different measures of executive functioning which can be considered separately or combined into an overall score.  The Brixton Spatial Anticipation Test  The Brixton test is a visuospatial sequencing task with rule changes. This test measures the ability to detect rules in sequences of stimuli. It usually takes between five and ten minutes to administer, and yields an easily understood scaled score of between 1 and 10. The Brixton Test is perceptually simple and does not require a verbal response. It is thus appropriate for people who are suffering from a wide range of associated deficits such as those involving speech production or reading.  Clinical uses of the Hayling and Brixton tests  The tests are used by clinical neuropsychologists to assess executive functioning in people with neurological disorders such as tumors, strokes, acquired brain injury, Parkinson's disease, dementia, Korsakoff's syndrome, encephalitis, and also psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia.

It was written by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban and Frank Spotnitz and directed by Peter Markle. The episode explores the series' overarching mythology. The episode premiered in the United States on December 7, 1997 on the Fox network, earning a Nielsen household rating of 12.8 and being watched by 20.91 million people in its initial broadcast. It received moderately positive reviews from television critics, with many complimenting Gillian Anderson's performance. The show centers on FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully, on Christmas vacation with her family, receives a mysterious phone call that leads her to a case involving a little girl that she believes to be the daughter of her dead sister, Melissa. \\"Christmas Carol\\" is the first of a two-part story that concludes with episode seven, \\"Emily\\". The episode was inspired by the 1951 British film Scrooge, starring Alastair Sim. The young actress who originally played Emily was terrified of the hospital setting in the episode's sequel \\"Emily\\", and as a result the producers had to recast the role and reshoot all footage featuring her including her scene featured in this episode. Gillian Anderson's younger sister, Zoe, was chosen to play Scully in a flashback sequence.  Plot  Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her mother visit her brother Bill and his wife Tara, who is expecting, around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and the person on the other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where local police are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. Kresge, the lead detective on the case, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on. Scully visits Kresge, wanting to look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, despite the fact that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a striking resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas. Kresge comes to see Scully, telling her that the Sims received several large payments from a pharmaceutical company, Prangen Industries. The two visit Dr. Calderon, who tells them that Emily was part of clinical trials and that Roberta was paid the money to keep her from pulling Emily from the program. Marshall Sim is arrested for the murder of his wife. Scully visits Emily and gives her the cross necklace. Marshall confesses soon after, but is found dead in his cell shortly after being visited by the two dark-suited men. Bill shows Scully a photo of Melissa, who is clearly not pregnant, shortly before Emily was born, which he thinks proves that she isn't Emily's mother. Scully meets with someone from an adoptive agency, wanting to adopt Emily. The woman is very hesitant considering Scully's job and the fact that Emily is a special needs child. Scully flashes back to talking with Melissa around Christmas time shortly before she joined the FBI. On Christmas morning Scully receives the results of a DNA test from the FBI proving that Melissa is not Emily's mother‚Äîshe is.Meisler, pp. 61‚Äì70  Production  =Writing= During the second week of October 1997, David Duchovny was unable to film, as he was busy promoting his film Playing God (1997), so the producers decided to spend this week filming a Scully-centric episode. Given that this episode was slated to air in December of that year, writers Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz initially tried writing a Christmas episode similar to the 1951 film Scrooge, with Dana Scully in place of Alastair Sim's Scrooge. However, the three were unable to develop any more ideas, and so they decided to instead feature Scully being visited by \\"earlier versions of her family members herself\\", resulting in the flashback sequences that pepper the episode.Meisler, pp. 70‚Äì71 =Filming= The young actress who had originally been cast to play Emily had severe nosocomephobia, which was triggered during the filming of \\"Emily\\". Because the actress could not be calmed down, the show's producers were forced to recast the role and reshoot all footage featuring Emily in \\"Christmas Carol\\". The show's casting crew eventually replaced her with Lauren Diewold, who had previously appeared on an episode of Millennium. Due to the season's hectic shooting schedule, Gillian Anderson was unable to reshoot for the episode, resulting in Anderson's double being used instead. Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty casting Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin proposed using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zo√´ for the role.Meisler, p. 97 Props specialist Ken Hawryliw claimed the biggest challenge in producing the episode was finding Christmas paper from the 1980s for the flashback sequences. After production wrapped, Gillian Anderson was unsatisfied with her acting, stating: \\"I felt in the end that I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal.\\" Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that Scully \\"had no history with\\" Emily so she was unable to \\"play the kind of attachment I would feel if my own daughter, Piper, were going through the same thing.  Reception  \\"Christmas Carol\\" premiered on the Fox network on December 7, 1997. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 12.8, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 12.8 percent of all television-equipped households, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 20.91 million viewers.Meisler, p. 284 Several critics complimented Gillian Anderson's performance in the episode. The episode received moderately positive reviews from television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and called it \\"generally a terrific episode\\". Handlen wrote that he was \\"delighted to get another Scully-centric episode [especially] one that doesn't end up with her looking pale and deathly in a hospital bed.\\" Despite his approval of the script, he slightly criticized the series for writing Scully-centric episodes based solely on the idea that \\"something is being done to her\\" as opposed to against or with her. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four-and-a- half stars out of five. The two wrote that the script was \\"really sharp\\" and features \\"natural dialogue\\" that disguises the stumbles in the character study.Shearman and Pearson, p. 128 Shearman and Pearson also praised Anderson's performance, calling it \\"terrific\\" and noted that her acting \\"hint[ed] years before it happens to the relationship Anderson will enjoy with Robert Patrick\\", the actor who would go on to portray agent John Doggett. Matt Hurwtiz and Chris Knowles, in their book The Complete X-Files called the episode \\"a showcase for Gillian Anderson's startling acting chops.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 121 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique, on the other hand, gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She described the episode as \\"one [where] disbelief isn't suspended so much as hung by the neck until dead\\". She heavily derided the episode's \\"overnight DNA tests\\", \\"helpful couriers that deliver the results at Christmas\\", and the fact that Scully fills out an adoption paper and is visited by a Social Service agent on Christmas Eve.

London became a haven for the burgeoning ideas of Polish socialism as a solution for regaining independence as it sought international support for the forthcoming Polish uprising.J√≥zef Buszko, Narodziny ruchu socjalistycznego na ziemiach polskich, Krak√≥w 1967, pp. 8‚Äì32 (in Polish) A number of Polish exiles fought in the Crimean War on the British side. The late 19th century brought pogroms against Polish Jews in the Russian (Congress Poland) and Austrian portions of partitioned Poland (Galicia), which forced many to flee their partitioned homeland; most emigrated to the United States, but some settled in British cities, especially London, Manchester, Leeds and Kingston upon Hull.Andrew Godley, 2001) Enterprise and Culture, New York, Palgrave, 2001, , chapter 1.Rosemary O'Day, \\"The Jews of London: From Diaspora to Whitechapel\\" http://fathom.lse.ac.uk/Features/122537/ The number of Poles in Britain increased during the Second World War. Most of the Polish people who came to the United Kingdom at that time came as part of military units reconstituted outside Poland after the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II. On 3 September 1939, Britain and France, which were allied with Poland, declared war on Germany. Poland moved its government abroad, first to France and, after its fall in May 1940, to London.See Imperial War Museum Collections for detail of all exiled governments in London http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/ The Poles contributed greatly to the Allied war effort; Polish naval units were the first Polish forces to integrate with the Royal Navy under the \\"Peking Plan\\". Polish pilots played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Britain and the Polish army formed in Britain later participated in the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France. The great majority of Polish military veterans were stranded in Britain after Soviet control was imposed on Poland after the war. This particularly concerned Polish soldiers from eastern areas which were not part of Poland anymore as a result of border changes due to the Potsdam Agreement.Sword, Keith. (1991) Ed. The Soviet Takeover of the Polish Eastern Provinces, 1939‚Äì1941 Basingstoke: Macmillan in association with the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London The Polish government-in- exile, though denied majority international recognition after 1945, remained at its post in London until formally dissolved in 1991, after a democratically elected president had taken office in Warsaw. The European Union's 2004 enlargement, and the-then UK Government's decision not to restrict immigration from the new accession states, encouraged educated and skilled Polish people to migrate to Britain rather than to Germany. Additionally, the Polish diaspora in Britain includes descendants of the nearly 200,000 Polish people who had originally settled in Britain after the Second World War and of whom about a fifth had moved on to settle in other parts of the shrinking British Empire.Chojnacki, Pawe≈Ç.

In 1550, he was superintendent of the Strangers' Church of London and had some influence on ecclesiastical affairs in the reign of Edward VI. Laski also spent some years working on the establishment of the Church of England. Shortly before his death, he was recalled to Poland's royal court. In the 16th century, when most grain imports to the British Isles came from Poland, Polish travellers arrived as merchants and diplomats, usually on the Eastland Company trade route from Gda≈Ñsk to London. Polish people are mentioned in Shakespeare's Hamlet (e.g. \\"sledded polack\\"), which Israel Gollancz attributes to influence of the book, De optimo senatore (The Accomplished Senator), by Laurentius Grimaldius Goslicius . Gollancz further speculated that the book was also an inspiration for Shakespeare to create the character Polonius, which is Latin for \\"Polish\\". After Poland's King John III, at the head of a coalition of European armies, defeated the invading Ottoman forces at the 1683 Ottoman siege of Vienna, a pub in London's Soho district was named \\"The King of Poland\\" in his honour, and soon afterward the street on which it stands was named Poland Street (and continues to be so to this day). In the 18th century, Polish Protestants settled around Poland Street as religious refugees fleeing the Catholic Reformation in Poland. =18th century= Stanislaus II Augustus, c. 1780 by Marcello Bacciarelli As a young man of the Enlightenment, and already befriended by a Welsh diplomat, Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, the young Stanislaus Poniatowski, future and last King of Poland, stayed in England for some months during 1754. On this trip he also came to know Charles Yorke, the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain.Michalski, Jerzy. \\"Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski\\", Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, vol.41, 2011, p. 613 In 1788, during the closing years of Stanislaus Augustus' reign, after the first Partition of Poland in 1772, the Polish called a special assembly, known to history as the Four Years Diet or \\"Great Sejm\\" whose great achievement was to be the Constitution of 3 May 1791. In that period Poland sought support from the Kingdom of Great Britain in its negotiations with Prussia in an effort to stave off further threats from Russia and from its own plotting magnates. Dulwich Picture Gallery, where the Polish art collection still remains In 1790, King Stanislaus Augustus sent Micha≈Ç Kleofas Ogi≈Ñski (also a composer and mentor to Frederic Chopin) on an embassy to London to meet with Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. The British were prepared, along with the Dutch, to propose a favourable commercial treaty for Polish goods, especially flax, if Poland ceded the cities of Gda≈Ñsk and Toru≈Ñ to the Prussians. This condition was unacceptable to Poland. Stanislaus Augustus also commissioned the London art dealership of Bourgeois and Desenfans to assemble a collection of Old Master paintings for Poland to encourage arts in the Commonwealth. The dealers fulfilled their commission, but five years later, Poland as a state cased to exist following the third and final Partition.Nisbet Bain, R.

Based at first in Paris, it moved to Angers until June 1940, when France capitulated to the Germans.Jozef Garlinski Poland in the Second World War, Page 81 With the Fall of France, the Polish Government-in-Exile relocated to London, along with a first wave of at least 20,000 soldiers and airmen in 1940. It was recognized by all the Allied governments. Politically, it was a coalition of the Polish Peasant Party, the Polish Socialist Party, the Labour Party, and the National Party. Although these parties maintained only a vestigial existence in the circumstances of the war, the tasks of the Government-in-Exile were immense, requiring open lines of communication with, and control of, the Polish Underground State in situ and the Polish Underground Army in occupied Poland, and the maintenance of international diplomatic relations for the organization of regular Polish military forces in Allied states. Mathematician Marian Rejewski c. 1932, when he first \\"broke\\" the German Enigma cipher On 4 July 1943 the Polish Prime Minister-in-Exile, General Wladyslaw Sikorski, who was also Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces in the West, died in an air crash off Gibraltar as he was returning to England from an inspection tour of Polish forces in the Mediterranean theatre. Until the Germans' April 1943 discovery of mass graves of 28,000 executed Polish military reserve officers at Katyn, near Smolensk in Russia, Sikorski had wished to work with the Soviets. After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Soviets' importance to the Western alliance had grown while British support for Polish aspirations had begun to decline.Christopher Kasparek, review of Michael Alfred Peszke, The Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II, [with] foreword by Piotr S.

As the war progressed, Polish plans to more completely incorporate Poland's underground Home Army into the broader strategy of the Western allies‚Äîincluding contingency plans to move Polish Air Force fighter squadrons, and the Polish Parachute Brigade, to Poland‚Äîfoundered on British and American reluctance to antagonise a vital Soviet ally hostile to Polish autonomy; on the distance from British-controlled bases to occupied Poland, which lay at the extreme flying range of available aircraft; and on the frittering away of the Polish Parachute Brigade on a patently flawed British operation at Arnhem, the Netherlands.Christopher Kasparek, review of Michael Alfred Peszke, The Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II, [with] foreword by Piotr S. Wandycz, Jefferson, North Carolina, McFarland and Company, 2005, , in The Polish Review, vol. L (2005), no. 2, pp. 237‚Äì39. One of the most important Polish contributions to Allied victory had actually begun in late 1932, nearly seven years before the outbreak of war when the mathematician-cryptologist Marian Rejewski, with limited aid from French military intelligence, constructed a double of the sight-unseen German Enigma cipher machine used by the German civil and military authorities. Five weeks before the outbreak of war, in late July 1939, Rejewski and his fellow cryptologists, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Rozycki had disclosed to French and British intelligence in Warsaw the techniques and technologies they had developed for \\"breaking\\" German Enigma ciphers. Poland's Biuro Szyfr√≥w (Cipher Bureau, operated by the Polish General Staff) gave the British and French an Enigma double, each. This enabled the British, who had been unable to break German Enigma ciphers at Bletchley Park, to develop their \\"Ultra\\" operation. At war's end, General Dwight Eisenhower characterized Ultra as having been \\"decisive\\" to Allied victory.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two, edited and translated by Christopher Kasparek, Frederick, Maryland, University Publications of America, 1984, , passim. Former Bletchley Park cryptologist Gordon Welchman wrote: \\"Ultra would never have got off the ground if we had not learned from the Polish, in the nick of time, details both of the German military... the Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use [by the Germans].\\" =Polish Navy= Operation Peking, the evacuation of Polish navy destroyers from Poland to Britain in late August 1939 The first Polish military branch to transfer substantial personnel and equipment to the United Kingdom was the Polish Navy. Shortly before the outbreak of hostilities, the Polish government ordered three destroyers, for their protection and in anticipation of joint operations with the Royal Navy, to sail for Great Britain (Operation Peking).Michael Alfred Peszke, Poland's Navy: 1918‚Äì1945, New York, Hippocrene Books, 1999, , pp. 36‚Äì37. Two submarines also sailed there, the Orze≈Ç (Eagle) arriving unannounced in Scotland after a daring breakout from the Baltic Sea following its illegal internment in Estonia. ORP Piorun officers and men on return to Plymouth after fighting the Bismarck Polish Navy personnel to come under Royal Navy command comprised 1,400 officers and 4,750 sailors.For a detailed account of Polish Navy forces (1918‚Äì47), see volume 5 of the journal of the Polish Nautical Association, Kadry Morskie, edited by Professor Jan Sawicki: Sawicki, Jan, Kazimierz.

By chance, Poland's only two ocean-going commercial liners, MS Pi≈Çsudski and MS Batory were also on the high seas on 1 September 1939 and were both shortly thereafter requisitioned by the British Admiralty for war service. The former was lost in November 1939 when it struck a mine off the Yorkshire coast.Note: its captain and first officer went down with the ship having first ensured the rescue of the entire crew. Batory, dubbed \\"the Lucky ship\\", became a troop and civilian carrier and hospital ship. It effected a major evacuation during the Battle of Narvik and completed hundreds of convoys on the Mediterranean Sea and on the Atlantic, before being surrendered to the control of the communist authorities in Warsaw in 1946.History of the MS Pilsudski and MS Batory http://www.derbysulzers.com/shipbatory.html retrieved 12-16-2017 In May 1941, the Polish destroyer Piorun‚ÄîThunderbolt‚Äîwas able to locate and engage the world's most powerful battleship, Bismarck, drawing its fire for an hour while the Royal Navy caught up in time to destroy the German warship.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two, edited and translated by Christopher Kasparek, Frederick, Maryland, University Publications of America, 1984, , p. 202. 303 Fighter Squadron pilots and Hurricane, October 1940 The Polish formed the fourth-largest Allied armed force after the Soviets, the Americans, and the combined troops of the British Empire. They were the largest group of non-British personnel in the RAF during the Battle of Britain, and the 303 Polish Squadron was the most successful RAF unit in the Battle of Britain. Special Operations Executive had a large section of covert, elite Polish troops who cooperated closely with the Polish underground army. By July 1945 there were 228,000 troops of the Polish Armed Forces in the West serving under the British. Many of these men and women came from the Kresy region (eastern Poland), including from the major cities of Lw√≥w (now Lviv, Ukraine) and Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania). They had been deported by the Soviets from the Kresy to the gulags when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union occupied Poland in 1939 under the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Two years later, when Churchill and Joseph Stalin formed an alliance against Adolf Hitler, the mostly \\"Kresy Poles\\" were released from the Gulags in Siberia to form \\"Anders' Army\\" and were made to walk via Khazakstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, where thousands perished on the way, to Iran. There the Polish II Corps came into being under British command. They fought in the battles of Monte Cassino, the Falaise Gap, Arnhem, Tobruk, and in the liberation of many European cities, including Bologna and Breda.The Jagiellonian University Polish Research Centre in London contains research material on the role played by Polish in the Second World War, including a YouTube film, the \\"History of Poland in London\\" http://www.pon.uj.edu.pl/?page_id=662‚ü®=en Retrieved 15 December 2017 Sikorski (left) and Winston Churchill review Polish troops in England, 1943. The Polish troops who contributed to the Allied defeat of the Germans in North Africa and Italy, had expected to be able to return at war's end to their Kresy (eastern Polish) homeland in an independent and democratic Poland. But at Yalta, Roosevelt and Churchill acquiesced in Stalin's Soviet Union annexation of the Kresy lands (roughly half of pre-war Poland's landmass), in accordance with the provisions of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact. This entailed massive postwar Polish population deportations to western so-called \\"Recovered Territories\\" assigned from Germany to Poland. The great majority of Polish soldiers, sailors, and airmen in the West would never return to their homeland. In apparent reaction to British acquiescence in Poland's postwar future, thirty officers and men of the Polish II Corps committed suicide.Olson and Cloud (2003), pp. 374‚Äì383. Churchill explained the government's actions in a three-day Parliamentary debate, begun on 27 February 1945, which ended in a vote of confidence. Many MPs openly criticised Churchill over Yalta and voiced strong loyalty to the UK's Polish allies. Churchill may not have been confident that Poland would be the independent and democratic country to which Polish troops could return; he said: \\"His Majesty's Government will never forget the debt they owe to the Polish troops... I earnestly hope it will be possible for them to have citizenship and freedom of the British Empire, if they so desire.\\" During the debate, 25 MPs and Peers risked their future political careers to draft an amendment protesting against the UK's acceptance of a geographically reconfigured Poland's integration into the Soviet sphere of influence, thereby shifting it westwards into the heart of Europe. These members included Arthur Greenwood, Sir Archibald Southby, Sir Alec Douglas- Home, Lord Willoughby de Eresby, and Victor Raikes. After the amendment was defeated, Henry Strauss, MP for Norwich, resigned his seat in protest at the British government's abandonment of Poland. The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London are the repository for archival material relating to this period.The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum: official website, http://www.pism.co.uk Private Wojtek Wojtek (right) and fellow Polish soldier, 1943 During their 1942 evacuation from the Soviet Union to the Near East, soldiers of the Polish Second Corps had, at an Iranian railroad station, purchased a Syrian brown bear cub. He travelled with them on the Polish troop- transport ship Ko≈õciuszko and subsequently accompanied them to Egypt and to the Italian campaign. In Italy he helped shift ammunition crates and became a celebrity with visiting Allied generals and statesmen. In order to bring him to Italy, as regimental mascots and pets were not allowed onboard transport ships, the bear was formally enrolled as Private Wojciech Perski (his surname being the Polish adjective meaning \\"Persian\\"; Wojtek is the diminutive for Wojciech). After the war, mustered out of the Polish Army, Wojtek was billeted, and lived out his retirement, at the Edinburgh Zoo, where he was visited by fellow exiles and former Polish comrades-in-arms and won the affection of the public. Posthumously he has inspired books, films, plaques, and statues in the UK and Poland. Post World War II =Polish Resettlement Corps 1946‚Äì49= Following the invasion of Poland in September 1939, many thousands of Polish servicemen and women made their way via Hungary and Romania (which then had common borders with Poland) to France, where they again fought against the invading Germans; and in 1942 the newly formed Polish Second Corps evacuated from the Soviet Union, via Iran, to the Near East, subsequently fighting in campaigns there and in North Africa, Italy, and northwest Europe. Some Second Corps personnel transferred from the Near East into Polish Armed Services units in the UK. At war's end, many of the Polish were transported to, and stayed in, camps in the United Kingdom. In order to ease their transition from a Polish-British military environment to British civilian life, a satisfactory means of demobilisation was sought by British authorities. This took the form of a Polish Resettlement Corps (PRC), as an integral corps of the British Army, into which such the Polish wished to stay in the UK could enlist for the transitional period of their demobilisation. The PRC was formed in 1946 (Army Order 96 of 1946) and was disbanded after fulfilling its purpose in 1949 (Army Order 2 of 1950).UK National Archives, Online Catalogue, Series Reference WO315. =Polish Resettlement Act 1947= The Polish Hearth Club in Exhibition Road, London, a Polish \\"hub\\" during and after WWII When the Second World War ended, a communist government was installed in Poland. Most Poles felt betrayed by their wartime allies and declined to \\"return to Poland\\" either because their homeland had become a hostile foreign state or because of Soviet repressions of Poles, Soviet conduct during the Warsaw uprising of 1944, the trial of the Sixteen, and executions of former members of the Home Army. To accommodate Poles unable to return to their home country, Britain enacted the Polish Resettlement Act of 1947, Britain's first mass immigration law. Initially, a very large Polish community was centred around Swindon, where many military personnel had been stationed during the war. After occupying Polish Resettlement Corps camps, many Poles settled in London and other conurbations, many of them recruited as European Volunteer Workers. Many others settled in the British Empire, forming large Polish Canadian and Polish Australian communities, or in the United States and Argentina. =Post-war dispersal and settlement= In the 1951 UK Census, some 162,339 residents had listed Poland as their birthplace, up from 44,642 in 1931. Polish arrivals to the UK included survivors of German concentration and POW camps and war wounded needing additional help adapting to civilian life. This help was provided by a range of charitable endeavours, some coordinated by Sue Ryder (1924‚Äì2000), a British humanitarian who, as Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, was later raised to the House of Lords and spoke there in the cause of Poland. Dame Cicely Saunders, hospice-movement pioneer Another British woman, Dame Cicely Saunders, was inspired by three displaced Polish men to revolutionise palliative care and care of the dying. She met the first two, David Tasma‚Äîwho had escaped from the Warsaw Ghetto‚Äîand Antoni Michniewicz, as they were dying. The third Pole, Marian Bohusz-Szyszko, a painter and art critic, supported her work and became her husband in old age. Saunders is considered the founder of the hospice movement.Hartley, Nigel. (2013). End of Life Care: A Guide for Therapists, Artists and Art Therapists. London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers. . pp. 30‚Äì31. Entrance to St Andrew Bobola Church, Hammersmith Britain's Polish immigrants tended to settle in areas near Polish churches and food outlets. In West London, they settled in Earl's Court, known in the 1950s as the \\"Polish Corridor\\", in reference to the interwar Central European political entity and, as house prices rose, they moved to Hammersmith, then Ealing, and in South London, to Lewisham and Balham. As these communities grew, even if many Poles had integrated with local British educational and religious institutions, the Polish Catholic Mission in England and Wales, in agreement with the English and Scottish hierarchies, considered that Polish priests should minister to Polish parishioners.The Polish Catholic Mission in England and Wales ‚Äì , 2005 The original Polish church in London in Devonia Road, Islington was bought in 1928 with much delay, following the First World War. However canonically, subsequent Polish \\"parishes\\" are actually branches of the Polish Catholic Mission and not parishes in the conventional sense and are accountable to the episcopate in Poland, through a vicar delegate, although each is located in a British Catholic diocese, to whom it owes the courtesy of being connected. The first post-war Polish \\"parish\\" in London was attached to Brompton Oratory in South Kensington, followed by a chapel in Willesden staffed by Polish Jesuits. Brockley-Lewisham was founded in 1951, followed by Clapham, while St Andrew Bobola church in Shepherd's Bush (1962) was regarded as the \\"Polish garrison\\" church. Among its many commemorative plaques is one to a clairvoyant and healer housewife and Soviet deportee, Waleria Sikorzyna: she had had a detailed premonitory dream two years before the 1939 invasion of Poland, but was politely dismissed by the Polish military authorities.Korabiewicz, Wac≈Çaw. (1984) Serce w d≈Çoniach - opowie≈õƒá biograficzna o Walerii Sikorzynie, London: Veritas Foundation. . Dr. Korabiewicz documents the singular life of the internationally known healer, in Polish. Currently the Polish Catholic Mission operates around 219 parishes and pastoral centres with 114 priests throughout England and Wales.Polish Bishops may loosen grip on British mission churches ‚Äì The Tablet, 26 January 2008 In 2007 Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, primate of England, expressed concern \\"that Poles are creating a separate Church in Britain\\", but Polish rector, Mgr Kukla, responded that the Polish Catholic Mission continued to have a \\"good relationship\\" with the hierarchy in England and Wales and said that integration was a long process. Britain's Polish immigrants 'are abandoning faith' ‚Äì Catholic Herald, 31 December 2007 =Cultural and educational ties with Poland= Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum, a leading Polish archive and museum in London founded on 2 May 1945 The social make-up of successive waves of Polish migration to the UK is comparable to 19th- and early-20th-century Polish migrations to France.Keith Sword, Norman Davies, and Jan Ciechanowski, The Formation of the Polish Community in Great Britain: 1939‚Äì1950, London, School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, 1989. In both cases, the original mainly political migrants were drawn largely from elite and educated strata and reflected the heterogeneity of their class, and they quickly established cultural institutions such as libraries and learned societies. They included representatives of past Polish minorities such as Jews, Germans, Armenians, Georgians, Ruthenians, and people of Muslim Tatar descent. In both cases, they were followed by waves of more socially-homogeneous economic migrants. Since the Second World War, Poland has lost much of its earlier ethnic diversity, with the exception of Polska Roma, a distinct ethnolinguistic group and other Polish Roma communities, and this has been reflected in recent Polish migrations to the UK.Guy, Will.

They began on 7 September 1939 with coded messages among prosaic material for the Polish Underground and after expansion into English by radio ended on 23 December 2005, a victim of budgetary cuts and new priorities. Across the mainland UK, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the original Polish communities chiefly comprised former members of the Polish Resettlement Corps. They set up Polish clubs, cultural centres, and adult and youth organisations, e.g., the Polish Youth Group (KSMP). They contributed to, and in turn were supported by, veterans' welfare charities such as veterans' SPK (Stowarzyszenie Polskich Kombatant√≥w), airmen's and naval clubs. These organisations' original aims were to provide venues for socialising and exposure to Polish culture and heritage for children of former Polish Resettlement Corps members. Many of these groups remain active, and steps are being taken to cater to more recent Polish migrants. The post-war phase saw a continuation of Polish intellectual and political life in microcosm in the UK, with the publication of newspapers and journals such as Dziennik Polski and Wiadomo≈õci, the establishment of independent (of the Polish \\"regime\\") publishing houses such as \\"Veritas\\" and \\"Odnowa\\", with a worldwide reach, and professional theatrical productions under the auspices of a dramatic society, \\"Syrena\\".

Polish Social and Cultural Association (POSK) building, Hammersmith As a result of the 1939 invasion of Poland, the entirety of Polish universities and academic research fell into disarray. Although very reduced tertiary teaching continued underground, many academics perished in Katyn and in Concentration camps or shared the fate of the civilian population. Those who were abroad at the outbreak of war or who managed to escape set about salvaging their heritage outside Poland. During the war several British universities hosted Polish academic departments to enable Polish students to complete their interrupted studies: thus Liverpool offered veterinary science in Polish and Oxford hosted a Polish faculty of law, and Edinburgh had a Polish Medical Faculty, whose alumni fortuitously joined the roll out of the National Health Service in the UK.Jubilee edition of Fakty UMP to celebrate the Polish Medical School at Edinburgh University, 2016: Jubileusz ‚Äì Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Initially they sent food parcels and medicines as Poland recovered from the ravages of war then the assistance changed to money transfers, sometimes from their own meagre pensions, in the belief that they were still better off living in freedom. Tazab and Haskoba were the earliest UK-based parcel operations, while Grabowski was a mail order pharmacy.Note: the Polish-owned parcel businesses, Tazab and Haskoba, were both started by pre-war Polish diplomats.

In the 1960s a purge of communist party members and intellectuals of Jewish descent led to a further influx of Poles into the UK.

The Polish Trustee Association, founded by the Ex-Combatants (SPK), handled legacies left by Polish DPs for their kin in Poland.Ko≈∫minski, Jaros≈Çaw.(2016) \\"Jubileusz stowarzyszenia powierniczego\\",Tydzie≈Ñ Polski http://www.tydzien.co.uk/artykuly/2016/08/16/jubileusz-stowarzyszenia- powierniczego/ article in the Polish Weekly about the 60th anniversary of the Polish Trustee Association =Remembrance= Mieczys≈Çaw Lubelski's memorial to Polish airmen at Northolt Polish servicemen who died in the Battle of Britain or subsequently, found their final resting places mainly in six cemeteries across the United Kingdom: Newark-on-Trent, Blackpool, Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey, Yatesbury in Wiltshire, Grangemouth in Scotland, and Wrexham in Wales. Then, as the first generation of √©migr√©s settled in various urban areas, often clustered around Polish clubs and churches, their graves and memorials began to appear in nearby existing cemeteries. Thus in London and its environs there were Polish burials especially in Brompton (Central London), Gunnersbury, Mortlake, Norwood and Putney Vale cemeteries.Suchcitz, Andrzej. (1992) \\"Non omnis moriar\\"--: Polacy na londy≈Ñskim cmentarzu Brompton, Warszawa: Oficyna Wydawnicza ‚ÄûAudiutor‚Äù (Polish burials at London's Brompton Cemetery, in Polish The Polish War Memorial, in a prominent position close to RAF Northolt West of London, commemorating the Polish airmen who fought for Great Britain, was erected in two stages. It was initially unveiled in 1948 with the names of 1,243 flyers. In time, a further 659 names were identified and were added during a refurbishment of the monument carried out in 1994-6 funded by a public appeal. It was ceremonially re-opened. In 2015 a memorial garden was added to mark the 75th anniversary of the battle. The monument is Grade II listed by English Heritage. Franciszek Kornicki (1916‚Äì2017) is the last Polish fighter pilot to die. His funeral was held in November 2017.Zmar≈Ç Franciszek Kornicki, weteran walk powietrznych w Wielkiej Brytanii Retrieved 25 November 2017 Katyn Monument By contrast, the wish of the British Polish community to honour its 28,000 fellow countrymen, many of them close relatives, who fell victim of the Katyn massacre with a memorial met with sustained obstruction from the British authorities. This, it appears, was owing to the effective diplomatic pressure exerted by the Soviet Union on Anglo-Soviet relations at the height of the Cold War. Despite public funds having been raised, the project was delayed for many years. A measure of d√©tente in East-West relations in the mid 1970s, allowed a monument to be installed inside Gunnersbury Cemetery. There was no official British attendance at the unveiling in September 1976. Those British officials who came, did so in their private capacity. There are now over a dozen Polish war memorials across the UK, including in the RAF church, St Clement Danes in the City of London and St Andrew Bobola Church, Hammersmith.P.Best, M.Reczek, A.Suchcitz, Kronika Ko≈õcio≈Ça ≈öw. Andrzeja Boboli w Londynie 1961-2011 (Chronicle of St Andrew Bobola Church in London), Polska Misja Katolicka, (Polish Catholic Mission) London 2012, (in Polish) 21st-century economic immigration Polish natives employed in UK, 2003‚Äì10. More Polish Grocery stores opened up across the UK after Poland joined the EU in 2004, such as this deli in Coventry. Polish pierogi bar in West Yorkshire During the twentieth century, world events meant that in Europe, London eclipsed Paris as the traditional destination of choice for Polish dissidents. The establishment of Polish communities across the UK after the Second World War along with supporting institutions cemented links between the UK-Polish community and relatives and friends in Poland. This encouraged a steady flow of migrants from Poland to the UK, which accelerated after the fall of Communism in 1989. Throughout the 1990s, Poles used the eased travel restrictions to move to the UK and work, sometimes in the grey economy. Poland joined the EU on 1 May 2004 and Poles, as EU citizens, gained the right to freedom of movement and establishment across the European Union. Most member states, though, had negotiated temporary restrictions to their labour markets, up to a maximum of seven years, for citizens from new member states. To the contrary, the UK (as Sweden too) granted immediate full access to its labour market to citizens from the new member states. over entrants from these accession states, Seven-year temporary restrictions on benefits that EU citizens including Poles could claim,covered by the Worker Registration Scheme, ended in 2011. The Home Office publishes quarterly statistics on applications to the Worker Registration Scheme. Figures published in August 2007 indicated that some 656,395 persons were accepted on to the scheme between 1 May 2004 and 30 June 2007, of whom 430,395 were Polish nationals. However, as the scheme is voluntary, offers no financial incentive and is not enforced; immigrants are free to choose whether or not to participate. They may work legally in the UK provided they have a Polish identity card or passport and a UK National Insurance number. This has led to some estimates of Polish nationals in the UK being much higher. The Polish magazine Polityka launched a 'Stay With Us' scheme offering young academics a ¬£5,000 bonus to encourage them to live and work at home in Poland. Additionally on 20 October 2007, a campaign was launched by the British Polish Chamber of Commerce called \\"Wracaj do Polski\\" ('Come Back to Poland') which encouraged Poles living and working in the UK to return home. By the end of 2007, stronger economic growth in Poland than in the UK, falling unemployment and the rising strength of the Polish z≈Çoty had reduced the economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK. Poland was one of the few countries to not be badly affected by the 2008 economic downturn. Labour shortages in Polish cities and in sectors such as construction, IT and financial services have also played a part in stemming the flow of Poles to the UK. According to the August 2007 Accession Monitoring Report, fewer Poles migrated in the first half of 2007 than in the same period in 2006. There was a baby boom under Martial Law in Poland in the early-1980s. Consequently, the 2000s saw an over- supply of new workers on the Polish job market. Unemployment rose and many young and educated Poles chose to look for work overseas. As Poland's demographic bulge slimmed, new entrants to the domestic labour market reduced and emigration slowed. Some commentators say the Polish baby-boomers began returning to Poland as they reached child-rearing age themselves. Demographics =Population size= The 2001 UK Census recorded 60,711 Polish-born UK residents; 60,680 of these resided in Great Britain (not including Northern Ireland), compared to 73,951 in 1991. Following immigration after Poland's accession to the EU, the Office for National Statistics estimated 832,000 Polish-born residents in the UK in 2018, making Poles the largest overseas-born group, having outgrown the Indian-born population. The 2011 UK Census recorded 579,121 Polish-born residing in England, 18,023 in Wales, 55,231 in Scotland, and 19,658 in Northern Ireland. Unofficial estimates have put the number of Poles living in the UK higher, at up to one million. =Geographic distribution= Polish-speakers in England and Wales According to the 2011 UK Census in England and Wales, there are 0.5 million residents whose main language is Polish; which amounts to 1% of the whole population aged three years and over. In London, there were 147,816 Polish speakers. The main concentration of Polish people in London is in Ealing, in West London (21,507; 6.4% of all usual residents). Elsewhere in the capital, the biggest Polish communities are in the outer Boroughs of: Haringey, Brent, Hounslow, Waltham Forest, Barnet. Outside London, the largest Polish communities are in: Birmingham, Southampton, Slough (8,341; 5.9%), Luton, Leeds, Peterborough, Nottingham, Manchester, Leicester, Coventry and the Borough of Boston in Lincolnshire (2.975; 4.6%). Scotland has seen a significant influx of Polish immigrants. Estimates of the number of Poles living in Scotland in 2007 ranged from 40,000 (General Register Office for Scotland) to 50,000 (the Polish Council). The 2011 UK Census recorded 11,651 people in Edinburgh born in Poland, which is 2.4% of the city's population ‚Äì a higher proportion than anywhere else in Scotland apart from Aberdeen, where 2.7% were born in Poland. In Northern Ireland, the number of people reporting in the 2011 census that they were born in Poland was 19,658, and the number stating that they spoke Polish as a first language was 17,700. Despite a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) recruitment drive in November 2006 that attracted 968 applications from Poles, with language exams being held both in Northern Ireland and in Warsaw, , none had entered the PSNI's ranks. The first Polish national to join the PSNI started working in August 2010. =Employment and social activities= Federation of Poles in Great Britain logo In London and various other major cities, Poles are employed across virtually all sectors from care work and construction and the service industries to education, NHS, banking and business and the liberal professions. There is a significant group of people involved in the arts, in writing, journalism and photography. In rural areas of low-population density, such as East Anglia and the East Midlands; Polish workers tend to be employed in agriculture and light industry. The Polish Social and Cultural Association in Hammersmith which houses a number of organisations, an exhibition space, a theatre and several restaurants, is a popular venue. The Federation of Poles in Great Britain (ZPWB) which was set up to promote the interests of Poles in Great Britain acts as an umbrella for more than seventy organisations throughout the UK. Both these institutions also aim to promote awareness of Polish history and culture among British people. Since Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, Polish delicatessens, with regular deliveries of fresh produce from Poland, are an increasingly familiar feature along British streets and foodstuffs from Poland are supplied to most of the supermarket chains. New publications in Polish have joined the pre-existing titles, including several free magazines carrying news and features and filled with advertising are booming. A local newspaper in Blackpool is one of a handful of British newspapers to have its own online edition in Polish called Witryna Polska. Social questions 2016 Guardian edition dedicated to Poles in the UK =Education= Many Poles who have migrated to the UK since the enlargement of the EU have brought children with them. This has created some pressure on school places and English language support services. Despite language difficulties, research shows these pupils perform well in British schools and the presence of Polish pupils in schools has improved the performance of other pupils in those schools. Plans under the Coalition Government to abolish exams in Polish by 2018, among other languages, at GCSE and A-Level, on the grounds that they were no longer cost-effective due to \\"falling popularity\\" were scrapped in the wake of protests in Parliament and a petition co-ordinated by the Polish Educational Society. =Integration and intermarriage= Rosena Allin-Khan, MP Polish newcomers to the United Kingdom follow previous patterns of integration, depending on where they can afford to live, on their educational and employment status, and on the presence of other ethnicities. In 2012 most of the 21,000 children born to Polish mothers had Polish fathers; of the rest had fathers from other backgrounds. In 2014 there were 16,656 children born with Polish mothers and fathers from European backgrounds (Other white and white british).https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/.../livebirths/datasets/parentscountryofbirth/...xls There were 702 children born to Polish mothers and fathers from African backgrounds and 749 children born to Polish mothers and fathers from Asian and Middle Eastern backgrounds. =Polonophobia in Britain= Polish people living in Britain reported 42 \\"racially motivated violent attacks\\" against them in 2007, compared with 28 in 2004. On 11 July 2012, the Polish Association of Northern Ireland called for action after Polish flags were burned on Eleventh Night bonfires in several locations across Belfast. On 26 July 2008, The Times published a comment piece by restaurant reviewer Giles Coren, which expressed negative sentiments towards Poles in part due to Coren's belief that Poles forced his Jewish ancestors to flee Poland after the Second World War. Coren used the term \\"Polack\\" to refer to the Polish diaspora in Britain, arguing that \\"if England is not the land of milk and honey it appeared to them three or four years ago, then, frankly, they can clear off out of it\\". The far-right British National Party (BNP) have expressed anti-Polish sentiments in their political campaigns, and campaigned for a ban on all Polish migrant workers to Britain. In one highly publicised incident, the party used an image of a Second World War Spitfire fighter plane under the slogan \\"Battle for Britain\\", during the party's 2009 European Elections campaign. However, the photograph was of a Spitfire belonging to the Polish No.303 Squadron of the Royal Air Force. John Hemming, MP for Yardley, Birmingham, ridiculed the party for accidentally using an image of Polish airplanes in their campaign: \\"[t]hey have a policy to send Polish people back to Poland ‚Äì yet they are fronting their latest campaign using this plane.\\" In January 2014, a Polish man, whose helmet was emblazoned with the flag of Poland, claimed he was attacked by a group of fifteen men outside a pub in Dagenham, London. The victim blamed speeches of then-Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron for causing the attack. During the same month in Belfast, there were seven attacks on Polish homes within ten days; in which stones and bricks were thrown at the windows.

In March 1848, Copenhagen was full of rumours that Schleswig and Holstein had rebelled against Denmark, and the National Liberals took advantage of the situation by arranging protest demonstrations against King Frederick VII and his politics.Skou. Dansk politik A-√Ö, p. 10. On 21 March, King Frederick responded by dismissing his ministers and asking Carl Emil Bardenfleth to form a new government. Bardenfleth failed to reach a compromise with the National Liberals, however, and so did Peter Georg Bang whom the king had asked to take his place. On the morning of 22 March the king begged Adam Wilhelm Moltke, the leader of the previous cabinet, to lead a government of responsible ministers, effectively ending the absolute monarchy.

CNN executive Tom Johnson is on the right. John Holliman (October 23, 1948 - September 12, 1998) was an American broadcast journalist. He was a member of the original reporting corps for CNN, serving as its agriculture correspondent after serving in the same capacity for Associated Press Radio in Washington, DC. He rose to prominence as one of CNN's \\"Boys of Baghdad\\" during the first Persian Gulf War in 1991 and was one of only three journalists reporting from Baghdad when allied bombing of the city began. He was later known for his coverage of science, technology, and space exploration. Holliman began his broadcasting career as a news and sports reporter for a local radio station in his hometown of Thomaston, Georgia. After two years at junior college, he transferred to the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. There he worked in the School of Journalism's student broadcasting operations, graduated, and began working as the news director for radio station WGAU, and later as senior newsman at radio station WRFC. He then moved to Atlanta and worked at the AM radio station WSB where he became a local celebrity by broadcasting live for several days from the site of a fire at an oil tank farm in Doraville, Georgia. Holliman landed a job in Washington, DC, working as agricultural editor for the Associated Press. When CNN was created in 1980, he returned to Atlanta to host a weekday morning segment on farming and agricultural news. He was also the first member of the CNN Washington bureau. His international exposure increased after he covered the student uprising in Tiananmen Square, China. His \\"Holy Cow!\\" exclamation as a bomb exploded in Baghdad during the first night of the Persian Gulf War in 1991 became a national newspaper headline. Holliman was a frequent speaker and strong supporter of student journalists at the University of Georgia's School (later College) of Journalism. On September 12, 1998, he was killed in a head-on collision in his car near his home in suburban Atlanta. In May 1999, NASA dedicated the Launch Complex 39 Press Site auditorium at the Kennedy Space Center in Holliman's name. In popular culture John Holliman appeared in Robert Wiener's book Live from Baghdad. He appeared as a character in the 2002 HBO film of the same name where he was portrayed by actor John Carroll Lynch. The book as well as the film features Holliman's sudden involvement, under Wiener's supervision, in CNN's coverage of the Gulf War. Holliman was part of the live coverage of the January 17, 1991 Baghdad air strike where he, along with colleagues Bernard Shaw and Peter Arnett, kept broadcasting from their Al-Rasheed Hotel room amid extensive aerial bombing by the Western Coalition forces. John Holliman played himself in the science fiction film Contact (1997), based on the Carl Sagan novel of the same name. 6711 Holliman (1989 HG) is a main-belt asteroid named for him.

It was written by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban and Frank Spotnitz and directed by Kim Manners. The episode explores the series' overarching mythology. The episode premiered in the United States on December 14, 1997 on the Fox network, earning a Nielsen household rating of 12.4 and being watched by 20.94 million people in its initial broadcast. It received mixed reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully fights to protect her daughter‚Äôs life, while Mulder discovers her true origins. It is eventually discovered that Emily was created during Scully's abduction. Emily suffers from a tumorous infection and subsequently dies. \\"Emily\\" is the second of a two-part story that began with episode six, \\"Christmas Carol\\". The young actress who originally played Emily was terrified of the hospital setting in the episode's sequel \\"Emily\\", and as a result the producers had to recast the role and reshoot all footage featuring her including her scene featured in this episode. Filming for the episode was also disrupted when angry demonstrators protested at one of the show's filming sites.  Plot  In a dream-like sequence, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) walks through a desert and picks up a gold cross necklace on the ground. Continuing from the previous episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: Her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), and there are no true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder and Scully's family attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. While examining the girl, it is discovered that there is a strange, green cyst on the back of her neck, and when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out. The liquid causes the nurse to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids. Dr. Calderon, Emily's doctor who works for a company called Prangen, refuses to give the County Children's Center access to Emily's medical records, prompting Mulder to rough him up. However, when security arrives, Mulder is forced to leave. Later, he tails Calderon after Calderon leaves his office. Scully has imaging tests conducted on Emily. Calderon goes to see the Dark Suited Men, one of whom kills him by stabbing him in the neck with an alien stiletto; both men then morph into Calderon. Mulder follows as one of them leaves. The results of Emily's tests show her to be suffering from a tumorous infection. The other Calderon arrives at the hospital and injects Emily with an unknown green substance; he escapes by morphing into someone else. Scully believes that he is continuing the treatments, and the Sims were murdered because they were trying to stop him. Mulder follows the first Calderon clone into a building, where he meets Anna Fugazzi, an elderly woman in a nursing home. The doctor tells Scully that Emily is getting worse. A woman from the adoption agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects the names of the women in the nursing home to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was treating them. Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them at the nursing home, along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning, Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, deceives Mulder, and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily has gone into a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence at the nursing home and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand bags in her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.Meisler, pp. 87‚Äì96.  Production  The young actress who had originally been cast to play Emily had severe nosocomephobia, which necessitated the show's producers recasting the role and reshooting all footage featuring Emily in the previous episode \\"Christmas Carol\\".Meisler, pp. 70‚Äì71. Director Kim Manners recalls, \\"I called Bob Goodwin and said, 'We're dead in the water here, pal. This little actress is not cooperating at all'. We recast that role and started up again the next day.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 121. The show's casting crew eventually replaced her with Lauren Diewold, who had previously appeared on an episode of Millennium.Meisler, p. 97. The building used for the nursing home in this episode was occupied by squatters \\"a few days before shooting\\" in protest, as the building was slated to be converted into a condominium high-rise. While these squatters eventually left, anti-redevelopment protesters soon arrived and began picketing. The producers of The X-Files did not want to let the activists know they were filming, so they kept a \\"low profile\\" by removing any information from their clothing that would indicate that they worked on The X-Files. Although the crew hoped that the activists would disperse on their own, a few were still protesting when production on this episode began, resulting in the police getting involved.  Reception  \\"Emily\\" premiered on the Fox network on December 14, 1997. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 12.4, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 12.4 percent of all television-equipped households, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 20.94 million viewers.Meisler, p. 284. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics; many were more critical of the episode than \\"Christmas Carol\\". Emily VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and wrote that she did not \\"totally buy ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù [‚Ä¶] even though I like large portions of\\" the episode. VanDerWerff wrote positively of \\"most of the Scully scenes\\", noting that Anderson \\"found some of the raw sense of hope and loss\\" that the shots required. However, she was critical of the episode's plot, arguing that it only \\"goes through the motions\\" and \\"is about everybody getting really worked up over a little girl we‚Äôve just met.\\" She concluded that \\"two-parter is strongest when it grabs hold of this notion. But it‚Äôs at its weakest when it turns into just another episode of The X-Files.\\" Other reviews were decidedly more mixed to negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. The two wrote that \\"Mulder catches up with the store and immediately this all becomes a little more formulaic.\\" The two praised the episode's teaser, referring to it as \\"deathless prose\\", but were more critical of the plot, arguing that the episode \\"feels too soon to see yet more sequences of people standing around emoting as they watch the dying in the hospital\\", a reference to the show's earlier arc involving Scully's cancer. Shearman and Pearson, however, did compliment the performance of both Diewold and Anderson, and called the finale scene \\"wonderful\\".Shearman and Pearson, p. 130‚Äì31. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique, on the other hand, gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the episode's characterization, noting that the episode's opening sequence was \\"ludicrous\\" and its revelations were \\"out of the blue\\". Vitaris reasoned that, because Scully had spent time with her mother, remembered fondly her sister, and reconnected her faith in God in \\"Redux II\\", \\"this development just doesn't track.\\" Vitaris also criticized Mulder's antics, calling him a \\"thug\\" for beating up \\"an unarmed man and kicking him while he's down.\\"  Footnotes  Bibliography   External links  * \\"Emily\\" on TheXFiles.com * * Category:1997 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in San Diego Category:Television episodes written by Vince Gilligan Category:The X-Files (season 5) episodes Category:Television episodes set in hospitals ","title":"Emily (The X-Files)"},{"id":"9425856","text":"Vincent Chukwuemeka Ike (28 April 1931 ‚Äì 9 January 2020)Oyekan Owomoyela, \\"Ike, Chukwuemeka (1931‚Äì2020), The Columbia Guide to West African Literature in English Since 1945, Columbia University Press, 2013, p. 116.https://www.sunnewsonline.com/breaking-news-chukwuemeka-ike-is-dead/ was a Nigerian writer known for a mixture of lampoon, humor and satire. He owed a little bit of his style to his Igbo cultural upbringing. He studied history, English and Religious Studies at the University of Ibadan and earned a master's degree at Stanford university.Routledge Encyclopedia of Post-Colonial Literatures in English. Among many of the younger generation, he was popular as the author of Expo '77, a critical look at academic examination abuses in West Africa. Ike was a former registrar of the West African Examinations Council (WAEC). Early years Born in Anambra state, Nigeria, Ike was given the Christian name of Vincent but later chose his Igbo name, Chukwuemeka as his preferred choice (meaning \\"God has done great\\"). He was raised in a strict home. His father was a king, civic leader and disciplinarian who instilled in his son the necessity of civic duties and education. Chukwuemeka started early education in his native town. He left his town for further education at Ife- Mbaise and then from 1945 to 1950, he attended Government College Umuahia. He started writing at Umuahia for the school magazine, The Umuahian, and he was also influenced by teachers that included Saburi Biobaku, who had honours in English from Cambridge. Some eminent Nigerian writers who attended the school include Chinua Achebe, Christopher Okigbo, and Ken Saro Wiwa. After completing his secondary education, he studied at the University of Ibadan. While at the college, he was invited by Chinua Achebe to join the magazine club. He was a king, Eze Ndikelionwu of the great Aro town Ndikelionwu in eastern Nigeria, with the title \\"Ikelionwu XI\\" in his hometown of Ndikelionwu in Anambra State. Novels =Expo 77= In Expo 77, Ike tackles the issue of examination abuses. He explores cheating through the eyes of a university registrar who is forced to hire a detective due to the lack of trust he has in some of his applicants' r√©sum√©s because test questions have been leaked. The detective later discovers a wide variety of examination abuses; from the parents who demand new test results for their children, to principals who allow students to bring in textbooks for closed examinations. The author believed it was partly the corruption of the nation's leaders that had permeated the society and led to rampant unethical excesses.

It was written by Vince Gilligan and Tim Minear, and directed by Daniel Sackheim. It aired in the United States on January 4, 1998 on the Fox network. \\"Kitsunegari\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.6, being watched by 19.75 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. The X-Files centers on FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully search for the infamous killer Robert \\"Pusher\\" Modell (Robert Wisden)‚Äîa human with the ability to force his will onto others‚Äîafter he escapes from prison. The agents soon discover that he is not their only concern; he has a sister, and she is just as capable of mind-control as he is. \\"Kitsunegari\\" serves as a sequel to the third-season episode \\"Pusher\\". The episode's title means \\"Fox hunt\\" in Japanese. Minear's original story for the episode was one where a convicted criminal who happened to be an atheist would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man. Series creator Frank Spotnitz suggested that Minear should use fan favorite Robert Modell.  Plot  In Lorton, Virginia, Robert Patrick Modell escapes from a prison hospital, after which the guard on duty dazedly says, \\"He had to go.\\" Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrive at the prison and learn that Modell had suddenly woken up from his coma, caused when Mulder shot him, six months previously. Scully worriedly asks Mulder if he's deliberately playing Modell's game again by heading the investigation. The agents learn from Modell's physical therapist that the Little Sisters of Charity, who try to visit all the hospitalized inmates, have been seeing Modell. Modell calls the prison and talks to Mulder, who refuses to listen. The call is traced to a sports shop in Occoquan, Virginia where a Carbo-Bar wrapper is left on the counter. Later, Modell is holding a picture of a young woman in a house where a man is covered in Cerulean Blue paint. The agents identify the dead man as Nathan Bowman, who was the prosecutor at Modell's trial. \\"Kitsunegari\\", the Japanese term for \\"fox hunt\\", is written on the walls in blue paint. A paint smudge leads the agents to Nathan's wife Linda, a realtor who has an appointment with a \\"Mr. Fox Mulder\\" at a commercial property. Modell uses his influence to affect the first two officers to arrive, but he is not found. When she arrives, Linda tells the agents that her husband had talked about Modell. Mulder is confused, as Modell's actions do not fit his previous modus operandi. He investigates a nearby building, where he runs into Modell. Modell tries to get Mulder to listen to him, and eventually breaks Mulder's resolve. Mulder later tells Scully that he does not believe Modell is on another killing spree and, after an odd interview with Linda, believes she is the killer and has the same powers as Modell. Skinner suspends Mulder, but Mulder vows to prove his theory right. He talks with Modell's therapist again, who mentions that a nun from the Little Sisters of Charity had called him a \\"conquered warrior\\". On a hunch, Mulder tries to show her a picture of Linda. The phone rings and, after stating she is with Mulder, she sticks her hand into a fuse box and is fatally electrocuted. At the FBI safe house, a police car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully the news of the therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds the door of Linda's room locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but, once he is on the ground, Skinner sees that his hand is curled into the shape of the gun. As Modell is taken away on a stretcher, Mulder arrives and thinks that Modell forced Skinner to shoot him on purpose to protect Linda Bowman. Scully says that Linda has been taken home, at which an annoyed Mulder leaves to see Modell in the hospital. A nurse enters the hospital room and tells Mulder that she has to change the patient's bandages. When Mulder leaves, it is revealed that the nurse is actually Linda Bowman wearing a paper with \\"Nurse\\" written on it. Linda then talks Modell's heart into stopping. A nurse runs past Mulder, and he follows her into Modell's room, where Modell is pronounced dead. Mulder notices the \\"Nurse\\" paper has \\"214 Channel Avenue\\" on the back. That night, Mulder visits the address and finds Scully pointing a gun at him and claiming to be controlled by Linda; she kills herself. Mulder hears footsteps behind him and turns around to see Linda Bowman pointing a gun at him; \\"Linda\\" states personal information about Mulder, revealing herself to indeed be Scully despite what Mulder sees. She fires a shot at a figure moving behind Mulder, and he then sees Scully in front of him and the wounded Linda behind him. In Skinner's office, Linda Bowman's brain scan shows an advanced temporal lobe tumor, just like her fraternal twin, Robert Modell; the two had been separated at birth. Mulder has misgivings about nearly killing Scully and feels that he ultimately lost Linda's game.Meisler, pp. 98‚Äì109 Production The episode was written by Tim Minear and Vince Gilligan, and directed by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal who happened to be an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the \\"voice of God\\" commanding him to kill a truly evil man. The prisoner would have then escaped, with only Mulder believing that he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that \\"I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast.\\"Meisler, p. 110 Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested that the \\"convicted atheist\\" be replaced with Robert Modell from the third season episode \\"Pusher\\". Minear thus put aside the \\"Word of God\\" story (as it was called), and worked with Gilligan to write the final script. Robert Wisden, who had played Modell in the original episode, was re-hired for this episode, and Diana Scarwid was chosen to play Modell's sister. The scenes taking place at the Lorton Penitentiary cafeteria were actually filmed at a former hospital storage facility. In order to dress the set, the structure had to be cleared of aged detritus and garbage; this required the destruction of several large sump pumps, which were \\"jackhammered into smithereens\\". The body of Nathan Bowman, Linda's husband, was created by drenching an in-house dummy with the correct shade of paint. The episode's title, \\"Kitsunegari\\" (ÁãêÁã©„Çä) is a Japanese term meaning \\"fox hunting\\". The series hired two Japanese translators to produce the proper Japanese translation of the phrase and its associated Kanji glyph, due to the fact that \\"fox hunting\\" is not a pre-existing term in the Japanese language.Meisler, p. 111 Reception \\"Kitsunegari\\" premiered on the Fox network in the United States on January 4, 1998. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 11.6, with a 17 share, meaning that roughly 11.6 percent of all television-equipped households, and 17 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 19.75 million viewers.Meisler, p. 284 The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two wrote that, while \\"it lacks Vince Gilligan's trademark wit\\", the episode takes the plot threads started in \\"Pusher\\" to their \\"logical conclusions\\". Shearman and Pearson explained that the episode's acting, most notably that of Robert Wisden and Diana Scarwid, \\"helps raise 'Kitsunegari' above the average.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 131 Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a C+. He wrote that, despite his love for \\"Pusher\\", \\"'Kitsunegari' isn't anywhere near as good as its predecessor\\". Handlen cited the change in Modell's personality, his lack of a desire to kill, and Scully's portrayal as a \\"humorless scold who only sees the truth when required to for narrative convenience\\" as reasons why the episode was weak. He concluded that \\"Kitsunegari\\" was \\"not very well put together\\". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She called the entry \\"tame\\" compared to its original, although she understood the show's desire to write a sequel. Vitaris also criticized the fact that Modell never murdered anyone and called the episode's basic plot \\"cheesy\\". She did, however, compliment several of the episode's set pieces, such as \\"Nathan Bowman covered in cerulean blue paint\\"‚Äîwhich she called \\"striking\\"‚Äîand the scene wherein \\"Linda stops the heart of the suffering Modell\\", calling the latter \\"sensately performed.\\" See also * List of unmade episodes of The X-Files  Footnotes  Bibliography   External links  * \\"Kitsunegari\\" on TheXFiles.com * * Category:1998 American television episodes Category:Fiction about mind control Category:Television episodes written by Vince Gilligan Category:The X-Files (season 5) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Virginia ","title":"Kitsunegari"},{"id":"9425942","text":"Acharya Narendra Deva University of Agriculture and Technology is a university located in Kumarganj, Faizabad, Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, established in 1975.

It also has constituent colleges in Ambedkar Nagar district and Azamgarh district, as well as a planned college in Gonda district. History The foundation stone of was laid on January 15, 1974, by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at Mashodha near Faizabad. Laxmi Narain Rai was the first officer on special duty, succeeded by A.S. Srivastava in October 1974 and by the first vice-chancellor, A.D. Pandey in October 1975. In the same year the government of Uttar Pradesh decided that the main campus of the university would be established at Kumarganj, (Faizabad) Ayodhya instead of Mashodha. The university started functioning in a borrowed building of Gram Swalabi Vidyalaya Acharya Nagar, Naka, Faizabad. The Mahamaya College of Agriculture Engineering and Technology was established in 2002 at Ambedkarnagar by upgrading the department of Agriculture Engineering in the College of Agriculture.

She founded the Colombo International School, British School in Colombo and the Elizabeth Moir School. Education Elizabeth Moir read mathematics at Oxford, where she captained the Oxford University Women‚Äôs Tennis team which beat Cambridge University 16 to 1 in 1961. She stayed on at Oxford to complete the Diploma in Education. Career Soon after, she joined the Diocesan Girls‚Äô School in Hong Kong where she established the A Level Mathematics Department. She also played the flute in two orchestras in Hong Kong. After four years in Asia, Mrs Moir returned to England where she worked as an IBM systems analyst in the City of London working on networks for some of the major international banks In 1982, she came to Sri Lanka, with her husband, Kesang Tenduf-La, and three children, Tashi, Sonam and Chhimi, and founded the Colombo International School. Using the British curriculum and offering London O and A Level examinations, its main clientele was Sri Lankan parents who would otherwise have sent their children overseas to be educated. The fees were very modest and the doors were opened once again for Sri Lankan students to have a first-class English medium education. The school also managed to get the British Examination Departments to set O and A Level Sinhala examinations. During the unrest of the late 1980s, CIS continued to operate, with classes being held in different homes, fuelled by Mrs Moir‚Äôs desire to demonstrate to her students that their education should not be sacrificed to circumstance. In 1990, Mrs Moir was requested by President Premadasa to run a multimedia English language programme on television and radio to give the rural people an equal opportunity to learn the English language that their counterparts in the towns enjoyed. She invited Barbara Goldsmith, a former Head of BBC English, to work with her. Her team bought the hugely successful English language programme ‚ÄòFollow Me‚Äô from the BBC and used this with introductions in Sinhala and Tamil on the state radio and television at prime time. They had 80 language centres across the country from Jaffna in the North to Matara in the South, and held written and spoken English examinations set by the University of Warwick. She then moved on to found the British School in Colombo in 1994. She put together a group of trustees that included Lord Jack Butterworth, the first Vice Chancellor of Warwick University, Sir Frank Layfield QR and Dr Alistair Smith, the Overseas Representative of Aberdeen University. Mrs Moir was then persuaded by a group of parents to start the Elizabeth Moir School in 1996. The school has enjoyed enormous academic success, quoted in The Daily Telegraph as having the third best IGCSE results outside of the UK in 2012. Later in 2015 her A Level students achieved 38% A* grades and in 2016 64% of all papers at IGCSE were given A* grades which placed them ahead of their former rivals. Elizabeth Moir School places great emphasis on sports and the arts. In addition all students in the school are committed to community service projects. Mrs Moir is particularly involved with Sri Lanka Unites, a group that hopes to bring together youth from different communities, post-war. She is committed to moulding global citizens Mrs Moir‚Äôs past students have gone on to universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, UCL and Imperial College in the UK and to Harvard, Yale, MIT, Stanford, Cornell, Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton in America. Honors In June 2014 Mrs Elizabeth Moir Tenduf-La was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for her services to British Education and the teaching of English in Sri Lanka. This award was presented to her at Windsor Castle in July 2015 by Her Majesty the Queen. In June 2017, the Sarvodaya Trust Fund conferred on Mrs Moir Tenduf-La an award for her services to Sri Lankan society through her innovative work in the field of general education benefiting children in both urban and rural areas.

Gilbert was born in Toronto and grew up in a poor working-class family which he helped support during the Great Depression by selling newspapers at the corner of Yonge and Bloor for two cents eachJOHN GILBERT, LAWYER AND POLITICIAN: 1921-2006, by Allison Lawlor (September 13, 2006) Retrieved on 2007-02-10 and by gathering coal that had fallen off horse- drawn coal wagons in order to help heat his family's home. The home was eventually lost when the bank foreclosed on its mortgage. He was the youngest of five children, his parents were poor Irish Protestants who had immigrated to Canada. He left school early to support his family by working in a box factory until marrying his wife, Nora, and going to university. As an adult, Gilbert became a lawyer and worked briefly for a large firm. He left it, feeling they charged clients too much, and set up his own private practice. Once a week he went to the Salvation Army to operate a clinic where he gave free legal counsel to the poor. He vowed that every dollar he earned over $5,000 a year he would give away. He entered federal politics in the 1963 federal election running unsuccessfully as a New Democratic Party candidate in the Toronto riding of Broadview with a third-place finish.History of Federal Ridings, Parliament of Canada He won the seat two years later in the 1965 election and was re-elected in 1968, 1972 and 1974 before retiring from politics. While an MP, he devoted one day a week meeting constituents at the Woodgreen Community Centre where he would help them with their legal problems. Jack Layton said of Gilbert : \\"The work that John did in Parliament was exemplary. He, alongside Tommy Douglas and Ed Broadbent, believed that fundamental elements of healthy and prosperous living should not come and go with the precocity of economic times; rather, he believed that the purpose of having a government was to defend the rights and the dignity of people from every social station, and to ensure that nobody had to go without the basic necessities of life.\\" \\"He was one of the members of Parliament that I most admired in my life,\\" said former NDP leader Ed Broadbent who served in the House of Commons with Gilbert for several years, describing him as a gentle and kind individual adding \\"there wasn't a tinge of self-righteousness about him,\\" and that the MP \\"was always good in caucus. He knew the national issues and he made his views known.\\" In 1969, Gilbert criticized the Liberal government of the day accusing it of lacking the commitment to build affordable housing and instead spending money on an inquiry of the issue to discover what was already known. He retired from Parliament in 1978 to accept an appointment as a judge on the Ontario District Court. He asked a young Bob Rae to run as the NDP candidate to succeed him in Broadview. Rae accepted and was elected in a 1978 by-election.

Like much of the taxonomy in this genus this opinion may need to be revised once the species have been subjected to DNA analysis. =Subspecies= Subspecies are currently named on the basis of the hosts infected. This criterion may be subject to revision when DNA based taxonomy is applied to this species complex.

Works No substantive Scottish peerage had appeared since George Crawfurd's in 1716. In 1764, Douglas published the volume, The Peerage of Scotland;‚ÄòThe Peerage of Scotland, containing an Historical and Genealogical Account of the Nobility of that Kingdom from their origin to the present generation; collected from the public records and ancient chartularies of this nation, the charters and other writings, and the works of our best historians. Illustrated with copper-plates. By Robert Douglas, Esq.‚Äô with a dedication to the Earl of Morton and a list of subscribers prefixed. In his preface Douglas stated that he had sent for corrections and additions a manuscript copy of each account of a peerage to the contemporary holder of it. There are references in the margin to the manuscript and other authorities. In the preface to the peerage Douglas spoke of issuing a second part containing a baronage of Scotland, here using the word \\"baronage\\" in the limited sense of the Scottish gentry or lesser barons; Sir George Mackenzie had left materials for a work of that kind. In September 1767 he announced in the newspapers that the baronage was in the press; but before the publication of any part of it Douglas died. In 1798 appeared the first volume of his Baronage of Scotland, containing an Historical and Genealogical Account of the Gentry of that Kingdom, some of the concluding pages of which are by the editors, whose promise in their preface to issue a second volume was not fulfilled. The volume includes the baronets of Scotland. In 1813, a second edition of Douglas's chief work was published as, The Peerage of Scotland, Second Edition, Revised and Corrected by John Philip Wood, Esq., with Engravings of the Arms of the Peers. Prefixed to it is a list of Scottish noblemen and gentlemen who furnished the editor with documentary and other information. Wood incorporated in it a number of corrections of the first edition made by Lord Hailes (some of his unpublished critical comments were given by James Maidment). John Riddell referred to errors committed both by Douglas and by Wood. In 1795, Douglas's ‚ÄòGenealogies of the Family of Lind and the Montgomeries of Smithton‚Äô was privately printed at Windsor. Family Robert was the second son of Sir Robert Douglas, 4th Baronet, of Glenbervie (1661‚Äì1748) by his second wife, Jane Paterson, Lady Dunmure (d. 1750), and succeeded his half-brother, Sir William Douglas, 5th Baronet, who died childless. He married, circa 1738, Margaret, daughter of Sir James Macdonald, 3rd Lord Sleat and 6th Baronet (d. 1723), by his spouse Janet, daughter of Alexander Macleod of Talisker & Greshornish. They had three sons (two of whom died young), and a daughter, Janet (eventual heiress of this family), who married Kenneth Mackenzie, son of Donald Mackenzie of Rossshire and Elizabeth Mackenzie of Highfield, and left children. Their son, Lieutenant Kenneth Mackenzie (1754‚Äì1833) (later changed to Douglas) became a baronet. Sir Robert was succeeded by his son and heir: Sir Alexander Douglas (1738‚Äì1812), 7th Baronet, of Glenbervie. He married Barbara (d. 1815), daughter of James Carnegie of Findhaven, but left no children.

But before the first movie was released, his widow Josephine Earp sued 20th Century Fox for $50,000 in an attempt to keep them from making the film. She said it was an \\"unauthorized portrayal\\" of Wyatt Earp. She succeeded in getting Earp's name completely excised from the movie. His character was renamed \\"Michael Wyatt,\\" and the movie was released as Frontier Marshal.  Plot  Wandering lawman Michael Wyatt rides into a lawless town and runs into conflict with the local boss, Doc Warren.

She is concerned with the dominant constraints of cultural understanding within cultures, subversive to the idea of culture as being simply reproduced. Actors play with skill in a game of life with power and inequality. Seeing social structure as a kind of sporting arena, playing a game of life in the field, and that the rules are set by the society's structure. But one is a free agent, one does not have to follow the rules. One can break the rules of life. This results in one being carried away or results in changing the rules and boundaries by this action.

History Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University (Earlier, Rajendra Agricultural University) was originally established as India's first-ever Imperial Agriculture Research Institute. The foundation stone of the Agricultural Research Institute and college was laid by Lord Curzon on 1 April 1905. In his speech, the viceroy had expressed his vision that the seed he was planting would soon blossom out, making Pusa the nucleus of agricultural activities, research and education which would not only benefit Bihar and Bengal but the whole of the country and would attract the best of talents from India and abroad. In separate meeting with the Bihar Planters Association, he fervently hoped that the institute would-be of immense service to them in their grave hour of crisis caused by the German Indigo scientist. Lord Curzon left by the end of 1905 and Lord Minto was his successor. Till the last minute, he had seen through each and every detail of the Pusa project which virtually was his brainchild. Incidentally, one major issue on which he had not agreed was the architecture of the main building, its wings, vaults, and arches but finally, he gave his consent of course with a stint. Rightfully, Pusa received an imperial status in 1918, being renamed as the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute (IARI). In 1934, after a major earthquake rocked Bihar and which severely damage the main buildings, the Imperial Institute was shifted to the new Pusa campus in New Delhi and that eventually became Indian Agricultural Research Institute. What remained was downgraded to an agricultural research station until 3 December 1970, when the government of Bihar established Rajendra Agricultural University. On 11 May 2016 Parliament of India passed the Central University Bill. So RAU, Pusa has been upgraded to Central University and named as Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University.https://www.rpcau.ac.in/wp- content/uploads/2017/10/DRPCAU_ACT.pdf Academics There are five faculties in the university in the disciplines of Agriculture, Veterinary & Animal Sciences, Agricultural Engineering, Basic Sciences, Humanities & Home Science, besides the college of agriculture, fisheries and institute of dairy technology.

(C = Cooperate, D = Defect) Nice Guys Finish First (BBC Horizon television series) is a 1986 documentary by Richard Dawkins which discusses selfishness and cooperation, arguing that evolution often favors co-operative behaviour, and focusing especially on the tit for tat strategy of the prisoner's dilemma game. The film is approximately 45 minutes long and was produced by Jeremy Taylor. The twelfth chapter in Dawkins' book The Selfish Gene (added in the second edition, 1989) is also named Nice Guys Finish First and explores similar material.  Overview  In the opening scene, Richard Dawkins responds very precisely to what he views as a misrepresentation of his first book, The Selfish Gene. In particular, the response of the right wing for using it as justification for social Darwinism and laissez-faire economics (free-market capitalism). Dawkins has examined this issue throughout his career and focused much of his documentary The Genius of Charles Darwin on this very issue. The concept of reciprocal altruism is a central theme of this documentary. Additionally, Dawkins examines the tragedy of the commons, and the dilemma that it presents. He uses the large area of common land Port Meadow in Oxford, England, which has been battered by overgrazing. This provides an example of the infamous tragedy of the commons. Fourteen academics as well as experts in game theory submitted their own computer programs to compete in a tournament to see who would win in the prisoner's dilemma. The winner was tit for tat, a program based on \\"equal retaliation\\", and Dawkins illustrates the four conditions of tit for tat. # Unless provoked, the agent will always cooperate. # If provoked, the agent will retaliate. # The agent is quick to forgive. # The agent must have a good chance of competing against the opponent more than once. In a second trial, this time of over sixty applicants, tit for tat won again.

The movie is the second film produced by Sol M. Wurtzel based on Stuart N. Lake's biography of Earp, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal (later found to be largely fictionalized). An earlier version was Wurtzel's Frontier Marshal, filmed in 1934. The film was remade by John Ford in 1946, My Darling Clementine, which included whole scenes reshot from the 1939 film. Frontier Marshal co-stars Nancy Kelly, Cesar Romero as \\"Doc Halliday\\" (the name was changed for the film from the original \\"Holliday\\" because of fear of a lawsuit from Holliday's family), John Carradine, and Lon Chaney, Jr.. Ward Bond appears as the town marshal; Bond was also in the 1934 version, and later appears as Morgan Earp in Ford's film. Eddie Foy, Jr. plays the large supporting role of his father, entertainer Eddie Foy, in this as well as three other feature films, and looked almost exactly like his famous father.  Plot  In Tombstone, Arizona saloonkeeper Ben Carter (John Carradine) owns, the sheriff is unwilling to stop Indian Charlie (Charles Stevens) from shooting up the place, so new arrival Wyatt Earp (Randolph Scott) does. Earp is beaten by some of Carter's hired men for taking the law into his own hands. Dance hall girl Jerry (Binnie Barnes), is upset with Earp, so when her sweetheart Doc Halliday (Caesar Romero) gets to town, a showdown seems imminent. Earp and Doc instead become friends. Earp takes over as the lawman in town and also tries to convince Doc's former sweetheart Sarah Allen (Nancy Kelly) that their relationship can still work out. The two men work together after visiting entertainer Eddie Foy (Eddie Foy Jr.) is kidnapped, and also when Jerry joins forces with Carter to plan the robbery of a gold shipment. Doc is forced to perform surgery to save a life, then is shot in the back by Carter. Earp avenges his friend's death and Jerry leaves.

Prior to his death, his wife Sadie and he had gone to great lengths to keep her name out of the book, and she threatened litigation to keep it that way. In 1934, she had successfully forced the producers to excise her husband's name from the first movie. In 1939, Josephine Earp sued 20th Century Fox for $50,000 in an attempt to keep them from making the second film titled Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal. With the provision that Wyatt's name be removed from the title, and after receiving a $5,000 settlement, the movie was released as Frontier Marshal. In Los Angeles, Josephine became friends with many celebrities, including Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper. She received part of the money made by Stuart Lake's book about her husband as well as royalties from the movie.

After graduation from Gymnasia in Lw√≥w, Friedman studied at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lw√≥w, the University of Vienna and the Jewish Paedagogium under Salo Baron. He moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1925 after receiving his doctorate from the University of Vienna. Friedman taught at a leading Hebrew secondary school in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, as well as at the People's University of that city, at YIVO in Vilna (1935), and at the Ta·∏•kemoni of Warsaw (1938‚Äì1939). He also continued his historical research. In autumn of 1939 he returned to Lw√≥w, where he worked in the Science Academy of Ukraine. When World War II began, he was engaged in writing a comprehensive history of the Jews of Poland from the earliest beginnings through the twentieth century. After the fall of Poland at the beginning of World War II and the Nazi occupation of Lw√≥w, Friedman went into hiding on the \\"Aryan side\\" of the city i.e. outside the Lw√≥w Ghetto. He survived the war but lost his wife and daughter. After the liberation of Poland, he taught Jewish History at the University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and also served as the director of the Central Jewish Historical Committee (created by the Central Committee of Jews in Poland), whose mission was to gather data on Nazi war crimes. He collected testimonies and documentation and also supervised the publication of a number of pioneering studies, including his own on the concentration camp at Auschwitz. This work, To jest O≈õwiƒôcim, was published in Warsaw in 1945 and appeared in an abridged English version as This Is Oswiƒôcim (1946). He also continued to publish historical works, including several monographs on various destroyed Jewish communities, including Bia≈Çystok and Che≈Çmno and about Ukrainian-Jewish relations during the Nazi occupation. At the same time, he taught Jewish history at the University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (1945-1946) and was a member of the Polish State Commission to Investigate German War Crimes in Auschwitz and Che≈Çmno. After testifying at the Nuremberg trials, Friedman and his new wife decided not to return to Poland. For two years he directed the educational department of the Joint Distribution Committee in Allied-occupied Germany.

It can be broadly broken into three categories - regulation of the business of insurance; regulation of the content of insurance policies, especially with regard to consumer policies; and regulation of claim handling. History The earliest form of insurance is probably marine insurance, although forms of mutuality (group self-insurance) existed before that. Marine insurance originated with the merchants of the Hanseatic league and the financiers of Lombardy in the 12th and 13th centuries, recorded in the name of Lombard Street in the City of London, the oldest trading insurance market. In those early days, insurance was intrinsically coupled with the expansion of mercantilism, and exploration (and exploitation) of new sources of gold, silver, spices, furs and other precious goods - including slaves - from the New World. For these merchant adventurers, insurance was the \\"means whereof it comes to pass that upon the loss or perishing of any ship there followed not the undoing of any man, but the loss lighteth rather easily upon many than upon a few... whereby all merchants, especially those of the younger sort, are allured to venture more willingly and more freely.\\"Act of Parliament, 1601: 43, Elizabeth, C 12 The expansion of English maritime trade made London the centre of an insurance market that, by the 18th century, was the largest in the world. Underwriters sat in bars, or newly fashionable coffee-shops such as that run by Edward Lloyd on Lombard Street, considering the details of proposed mercantile \\"adventures\\" and indicating the extent to which they would share upon the risks entailed by writing their \\"scratch\\" or signature upon the documents shown to them. At the same time, eighteenth-century judge William Murray, Lord Mansfield, was developing the substantive law of insurance to an extent where it has largely remained unchanged to the present day - at least insofar as concerns commercial, non-consumer business - in the common-law jurisdictions. Mansfield drew from \\"foreign authorities\\" and \\"intelligent merchants\\" \\"Those leading principles which may be considered the common law of the sea, and the common law of merchants, which he found prevailing across the commercial world, and to which every question of insurance was easily referrable. Hence the great celebrity of his judgments, and hence the respect they command in foreign countries\\".Samuel Marshall, Treatise on the Law of Insurance (3rd edition, 1823), Vol 1, p. 23 By the 19th century membership of Lloyd's was regulated and in 1871, the Lloyd's Act was passed, establishing the corporation of Lloyd's to act as a market place for members, or \\"Names\\". And in the early part of the twentieth century, the collective body of general insurance law was codified in 1904 into the Marine Insurance Act 1906, with the result that, since that date, marine and non-marine insurance law have diverged, although fundamentally based on the same original principles. Principles of insurance Common law jurisdictions in former members of the British empire, including the United States, Canada, India, South Africa, and Australia ultimately originate with the law of England and Wales. What distinguishes common law jurisdictions from their civil law counterparts is the concept of judge-made law and the principle of stare decisis - the idea, at its simplest, that courts are bound by the previous decisions of courts of the same or higher status. In the insurance law context, this meant that the decisions of early commercial judges such as Mansfield, Lord Eldon and Buller bound, or, outside England and Wales, were at the least highly persuasive to, their successors considering similar questions of law. At common law, the defining concept of a contract of commercial insurance is of a transfer of risk freely negotiated between counterparties of similar bargaining power, equally deserving (or not) of the courts' protection. The underwriter has the advantage, by dint of drafting the policy terms, of delineating the precise boundaries of cover. The prospective insured has the equal and opposite advantage of knowing the precise risk proposed to be insured in better detail than the underwriter can ever achieve. Central to English commercial insurance decisions, therefore, are the linked principles that the underwriter is bound to the terms of his policy; and that the risk is as it has been described to him, and that nothing material to his decision to insure it has been concealed or misrepresented to him. In civil law countries insurance has typically been more closely linked to the protection of the vulnerable, rather than as a device to encourage entrepreneurialism by the spreading of risk. Civil law jurisdictions - in very general terms - tend to regulate the content of the insurance agreement more closely, and more in the favour of the insured, than in common law jurisdictions, where the insurer is rather better protected from the possibility that the risk for which it has accepted a premium may be greater than that for which it had bargained. As a result, most legal systems worldwide apply common-law principles to the adjudication of commercial insurance disputes, whereby it is accepted that the insurer and the insured are more-or-less equal partners in the division of the economic burden of risk. =Insurable interest and indemnity= Most, and until 2005 all, common law jurisdictions require the insured to have an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance. An insurable interest is that legal or equitable relationship between the insured and the subject matter of the insurance, separate from the existence of the insurance relationship, by which the insured would be prejudiced by the occurrence of the event insured against, or conversely would take a benefit from its non-occurrence. Insurable interest was long held to be morally necessary in insurance contracts to distinguish them, as enforceable contracts, from unenforceable gambling agreements (binding \\"in honour\\" only) and to quell the practice, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of taking out life policies upon the lives of strangers. The requirement for insurable interest was removed in non- marine English law, possibly inadvertently, by the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005. It remains a requirement in marine insurance law and other common law systems, however; and few systems of law will allow an insured to recover in respect of an event that has not caused the insured a genuine loss, whether the insurable interest doctrine is relied upon, or whether, as in common law systems, the courts rely upon the principle of indemnity to hold that an insured may not recover more than his true loss. =Utmost good faith= disclosure and good faith applies to selling most financial products, since Carter v BoehmCarter v Boehm (1766) 3 Burr 190 where Lord Mansfield held an East India Company fort holder failed to warn the insurer of an impending French invasion. Such regulation did not extend to derivatives that contributed to the Global Financial Crisis. The doctrine of uberrimae fides - utmost good faith - is present in the insurance law of all common law systems. An insurance contract is a contract of utmost good faith. The most important expression of that principle, under the doctrine as it has been interpreted in England, is that the prospective insured must accurately disclose to the insurer everything that he knows and that is or would be material to the reasonable insurer. Something is material if it would influence a prudent insurer in determining whether to write a risk, and if so upon what terms. If the insurer is not told everything material about the risk, or if a material misrepresentation is made, the insurer may avoid (or \\"rescind\\") the policy, i.e. the insurer may treat the policy as having been void from inception, returning the premium paid. Reinsurance contracts (between reinsurers and insurers/cedents) require the highest level of utmost good faith, and such utmost good faith is considered the foundation of reinsurance. In order to make reinsurance affordable, a reinsurer cannot duplicate costly insurer underwriting and claim handling costs, and must rely on an insurer‚Äôs absolute transparency and candor. In return, a reinsurer must appropriately investigate and reimburse an insurer‚Äôs good faith claim payments, following the fortunes of the cedent.Marcos Antonio Mendoza, \\"Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions\\", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 65-67, 102-107 (2014) https://ssrn.com/abstract=2573253 =Warranties= In commercial contracts generally, a warranty is a contractual term, breach of which gives right to damages alone; whereas a condition is a subjectivity of the contract, such that if the condition is not satisfied, the contract will not bind. By contrast, a warranty of a fact or state of affairs in an insurance contract, once breached, discharges the insurer from liability under the contract from the moment of breach; while breach of a mere condition gives rise to a claim in damages alone. Regulation of insurance companies Insurance regulation that governs the business of insurance is typically aimed at assuring the solvency of insurance companies. Thus, this type of regulation governs capitalization, reserve policies, rates and various other \\"back office\\" processes. =European Union= Member States of the European Union each have their own insurance regulators. However, the E.U. regulation sets a harmonised prudential regime throughout the whole Union. As they are submitted to harmonised prudential regulation, and in consistency with the European Treaty (according to which any legal or natural person who is a citizen of a Union member State is free to establish him-, her- or itself, or to provide services, anywhere within the European Union), an insurer licensed in and regulated by e.g. the United Kingdom's financial services regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, may establish a branch in, and/ or provide cross-border insurance coverage (through a process known as \\"free provision of services\\") into, any other of the member States without being regulated by those States' regulators. Provision of cross-border services in this manner is known as \\"passporting\\". =India= The insurance sector went through a full circle of phases from being unregulated to completely regulated and then currently being partly deregulated. It is governed by a number of acts. The first statute in India to regulate the life insurance business was the Indian Life Assurance Companies Act, 1912. The Insurance Act of 1938http://www.irdaindia.org/regulations/TheInsuranceAct1938er126042004.doc here was the first legislation governing all forms of insurance to provide strict state control over insurance business. Life insurance in India was completely nationalized on January 19, 1956, through the Life Insurance Corporation Act. All 245 insurance companies operating then in the country were merged into one entity, the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The General Insurance Business Act of 1972 was enacted to nationalise the about 100 general insurance companies then and subsequently merging them into four companies. All the companies were amalgamated into National Insurance, New India Assurance, Oriental Insurance and United India Insurance, which were headquartered in each of the four metropolitan cities. Until 1999, there were no private insurance companies in India. The government then introduced the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act in 1999, thereby de- regulating the insurance sector and allowing private companies. Furthermore, foreign investment was also allowed and capped at 26% holding in the Indian insurance companies. In 2015 the limit of FDI in insurance sector has been raised to 49% subject to certain conditions. In 2006, the Actuaries Act was passed by parliament to give the profession statutory status on par with Chartered Accountants, Notaries, Cost & Works Accountants, Advocates, Architects and Company Secretaries. A minimum capital of 80 million( 400 Crore) is required by legislation to set up an insurance business. =United Kingdom= *Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 =United States= As a preliminary matter, insurance companies are generally required to follow all of the same laws and regulations as any other type of business. This would include zoning and land use, wage and hour laws, tax laws, and securities regulations. There are also other regulations that insurers must also follow. Regulation of insurance companies is generally applied at State level and the degree of regulation varies markedly between States. Regulation of the insurance industry began in the United States in the 1940s, through several United States Supreme Court rulings. The first ruling on insurance had taken place in 1868 (in the Paul v. Virginia ruling), with the Supreme Court ruling that insurance policy contracts were not in themselves commercial contracts and that insurance was not subject to federal regulation. This \\"judicial accident\\", as it has been called, influenced the development of state-level insurance regulation. This stance did not change until 1944 (in the United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association ruling ), when the Supreme Court upheld a ruling stating that policies were commercial, and thus were regulatable as other similar contracts were. In the United States each state typically has a statute creating an administrative agency. These state agencies are typically called the Department of Insurance, or some similar name, and the head official is the Insurance Commissioner, or a similar titled officer. The agency then creates a group of administrative regulations to govern insurance companies that are domiciled in, or do business in the state. In the United States regulation of insurance companies is almost exclusively conducted by the several states and their insurance departments. The federal government has explicitly exempted insurance from federal regulation in most cases. In the case that an insurer declares bankruptcy, many countries operate independent services and regulation to ensure as little financial hardship is incurred as possible (National Association of Insurance Commissioners operates such a service in the United States ). In the United States and other relatively highly regulated jurisdictions, the scope of regulation extends beyond the prudential oversight of insurance companies and their capital adequacy, and include such matters as ensuring that the policy holder is protected against bad faith claims on the insurer's part, that premiums are not unduly high (or fixed), and that contracts and policies issued meet a minimum standard. A bad faith action may constitute several possibilities; the insurer denies a claim that seems valid in the contract or policy, the insurer refuses to pay out for an unreasonable amount of time, the insurer lays the burden of proof on the insured - often in the case where the claim is unprovable. Other issues of insurance law may arise when price fixing occurs between insurers, creating an unfair competitive environment for consumers. A notable example of this is where Zurich Financial Services \\\\- along with several other insurers - inflated policy prices in an anti-competitive fashion. If an insurer is found to be guilty of fraud or deception, they can be fined either by regulatory bodies, or in a lawsuit by the insured or surrounding party. In more severe cases, or if the party has had a series of complaints or rulings, the insurer's license may be revoked or suspended. Bad faith actions are exceedingly rare outside the United States. Even within the U.S. the full rigor of the doctrine is limited to certain states such as California. =Rest of World= Every developed sovereign state regulates the provision of insurance in different ways. Some regulate all insurance activity taking place within the particular jurisdiction, but allow their citizens to purchase insurance \\"offshore\\". Others restrict the extent to which their citizens may contract with non-locally regulated insurers. In consequence, a complicated muddle has developed in which many international insurers provide insurance coverage on an unlicensed or \\"non-admitted\\" basis with little or no knowledge of whether the particular jurisdiction in or into which cover is provided is one that prohibits the provision of insurance cover or the doing of insurance business without a licence.

They were originally the attributes of the deity Osiris that became insignia of pharaonic authority. The shepherd's crook stood for kingship and the flail for the fertility of the land. The earliest known example of a royal crook is from the Gerzeh culture (Naqada II), and comes from tomb U547 in Abydos. By late Predynastic times, the shepherd's crook was already an established symbol of rule. The flail initially remained separate, being depicted alone on some earliest representations of royal ceremonial. Approximately by the time of the Second Dynasty the crook and flail became paired. The only extant pharaonic examples of both the crook and flail come from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Their staffs are made of heavy bronze covered with alternating stripes of blue glass, obsidian, and gold, while the flail's beads are made of gilded wood. Theories on significance Traditionally crossed over the chest when held, they probably represented the ruler as a shepherd whose beneficence is formidably tempered with might. In the interpretation of Toby Wilkinson, the flail, used to goad livestock, was a symbol of the ruler's coercive power: as shepherd of his flock, the ruler encouraged his subjects as well as restraining them. Still another interpretation, by E. A. Wallis Budge, is that the flail is what was used to thresh grain.

The university inherited few assets and staff deployed at various stations and sub-stations from erstwhile SKUAST(J&K;) to carry on the mission of agriculture research and development. Currently, the main campus of the university, Faculty of Agriculture and Faculty of Basic Sciences is located at Chatha, Jammu. The Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry (F.V.Sc & A.H) is located at R. S. Pura, Jammu. History The Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, J & K was established in 1982 with the objectives of catering to the research, education and extension education requirements of the state. The entire educational infrastructure like colleges of Agriculture, Veterinary and Forestry came up in Kashmir province only and major infrastructure for research and extension was also developed in the same region. Subsequently, demand for the establishment of a separate Agriculture University for Jammu region was desired because the Jammu region is different from the Kashmir division with regard to its livestock, type and pattern of cropping and other factors. The problems of Jammu region are location-specific in research on crops, pulses, fruits, oil-seeds, vegetables, agriculture, species of livestock and poultry. Keeping these considerations in view, the then Prime Minister of India, Sh. H.D. Deve Gowda, during his visit to Jammu in 1996, announced the establishment of a separate Agricultural University for Jammu region. His successor-in-office, Sh. I. K. Gujral, subsequently reiterated this commitment. Following these announcements, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) constituted a committee popularly known as the Madan Committee. The Committee recommended, in principle, the establishment of the separate Agricultural University for Jammu. Accordingly, the Sher-e- Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences & Technology Act of 1982 was amended by the State legislature providing for a separate Agricultural University by the same name (SKUAST of Jammu).

The Faculty of Agriculture (FoA) is located in Wadura, Baramulla and the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry (F.V.Sc & A.H) campus is located in Shuhama, Alusteng, Ganderbal. History The university was founded in 1982 by an Act passed by the State Legislature of Jammu and Kashmir. It was named after Kashmiri leader Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah who is popularly known as Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir). The name given to the university was \\"Sher- e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology\\" (SKUAST). Initially, the university had jurisdiction over the entire State of Jammu and Kashmir with its headquarters at Shalimar, Srinagar. When the SKUAST Act came in force, the agricultural education, research and extension training units were transferred to SKUAST from various development departments viz; Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Sheep Husbandry and Sericulture of Jammu and Kashmir State. In 1998-99, the territorial jurisdiction of the University was redefined by amending the SKUAST Act 1982 under which a separate agricultural University was established for Jammu Division and named as Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Jammu (SKUAST-J) with its territorial jurisdiction extended to the entire Jammu Division. The parent University was renamed as Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir (SKUAST-K) Establishment of the university In 1979, the expert team of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) on the proposal of state government recommended the establishment of an agricultural university for the advancement of the agricultural sector in the state. The Act for the establishment of a university under the name and style of Sher-e- Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology was passed by the State Legislature in the 33rd year of the Republic of India on 31 March 1982 which came into force on 1 August 1982 with its jurisdiction over the entire State of Jammu and Kashmir and headquarters at Shalimar, Srinagar. With the establishment of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology (SKUAST) named after great patriotic leader Jenab Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah (popularly known as Sher-e-Kashmir) the agricultural education, research and extension training units were transferred to SKUAST from development departments of Jammu and Kashmir State -- agriculture, animal husbandry, sheep husbandry and sericulture. The university operates on the Land-Grant College concept following the Model Act of SAUs evolved by ICAR. It is a multicampus university. It is a matter of great satisfaction that extremely incoherent and stagnated research infrastructure, an initial customary educational base and non-existent extension education services have given way to an organised institution of SKUAST, which has taken over the responsibility of supporting the state in its effort to develop its agricultural economy in agriculture and allied sectors. There is no doubt that SKUAST has developed faster than many agricultural universities in the country. In 1998-99, the territorial jurisdiction of the university was redefined by amending the SKUAST Act 1982 under which a separate agriculture university was established for Jammu Division and named as Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Jammu (SKUAST-J). Sher- e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir has jurisdiction over Kashmir Valley and Ladakh comprising two agro-ecological zones. These include * Mid-high altitude temperate zone namely the Kashmir Valley covering the districts of Anantnag, Budgam, Baramullah, Pulwama, Kupwara, Bandipora, Ganderbal and Srinagar which has annual precipitation of 660 to 1400 mm with an average temperature around 13 ¬∞C and the altitude ranging between 1500‚Äì2500 m amsl. * Cold-arid region of Ladakh comprising the districts of Leh and Kargil which are cold desert with precipitation around 100‚Äì120 mm and altitude 2500‚Äì5300 m amsl and temperature fluctuating between +40 to -40 ¬∞C.

It involves not looking directly at the object, but looking a little off to the side, while continuing to concentrate on the object. This subject is discussed in the popular astronomy literatureBerman, Bob, ‚ÄúTormented by open clusters‚Äù, Astronomy, March 2019, p. 12. but only a few rigorous studies have quantified the effect. However, the technique is based on well-known properties regarding the structure of the eye. It is claimed this technique is most useful to astronomers for viewing large but faint nebulae and star clusters. By developing the technique, some observers report a gain of up to three or four magnitudes (15:1 to 40:1). Others report no appreciable improvement. There is some evidence that the technique has been known since ancient times, as it seems to have been reported by Aristotle while observing the star cluster now known as M41.M41 possibly recorded by Aristotle This technique of being able to see very dim lights over a long distance has also been passed down over hundreds of generations of sailors whose duties included standing lookout watches, making one better able to spot dim lights from other ships or shore locations at night. It also matters whether you avert right or left. The most effective direction is that which places the object on the nasal side of the vision. This avoids the possibility the object will be imaged on the blind spot at approximately 15 degrees on the temporal side of the line of sight. So, for right-eyed observers it is best to shift to the right, and for left-eye observers it is best to shift to the left. Some people also claim that it is better to avert up instead of down. The best thing to do is practice and find the best location for one's own eyes. A similar technique is called scope rocking, which is done by simply moving the telescope back and forth slightly to move the object around in the field of view. This technique is based on the fact that the visual system is more sensitive to motion than to static objects. Physiology Averted vision works because there are virtually no rods (cells which detect dim light in black and white) in the fovea: a small area in the center of the eye. The fovea contains primarily cone cells, which serve as bright light and color detectors and are not as useful during the night. This situation results in a decrease in visual sensitivity in central vision at night. Based on the early work of Osterberg (1935), and later confirmed by modern adaptive optics, the density of the rod cells usually reaches a maximum around 20 degrees off the center of vision. The resolution of the eye, its ability to resolve fine detail, falls off rapidly beyond 0.6 degrees from the line of sight as illustrated by Anstis (1974). It is four times poorer at 10 degrees radius as it is within the 0.6 degree radius from the line of sight.

It has few counters available and offers little in the way of customization. In contrast, the Windows NT Performance Monitor is available out-of-the-box and has over 350 performance measurement criteria (called \\"counters\\") available.Michael D. Reilly, \\"The Windows NT Performance Monitor \\" March 1997 Performance Monitor can display information as a graph, a bar chart, or numeric values and can update information using a range of time intervals. The categories of information that can be monitored depends on which networking services are installed, but they always include file system, kernel, and memory manager. Other possible categories include Microsoft Network Client, Microsoft Network Server, and protocol categories. In Windows 2000, the System Monitor of Windows 9x and the Performance Monitor of Windows NT 4 and earlier, as well as another program called Network Monitor, were merged into a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) plug-in called Performance, which consisted of two parts: \\"System Monitor\\" and \\"Performance Logs and Alerts\\". The \\"System Monitor\\" naming was kept in Windows XP. Some third-party publications referred to it as \\"Performance Monitor\\" however, even in Windows 2000 or XP contexts. The name displayed inside the MMC plug-in was changed back to \\"Performance Monitor\\" in Windows Vista, although it was also bundled with a Reliability Monitor and with a new performance summary feature called Resource Overview. In Windows 7, the resource overview feature was split to a stand-alone Resource Monitor application, with the landing page for the Performance Monitor in Windows 7 containing a pointer to the (new) Resource Monitor; Windows 7 also moved the Reliability Monitor to the Action Center. A new feature added to the Performance Monitor in Windows Vista is Data Collector Set, which allows sets of accounting parameters to be easily manipulated as a group.

His professional record stands at 23-4-1 with 12 knockouts. Amateur career Pearson had a 67-8 record, his career was crowned by a 1998 National Golden Gloves Lightweight Championship. Professional career Pearson turned pro in 1998 at the advanced age of 27. After four wins he was held to a draw in 1999 when he fought Philadelphia lightweight Anthony Washington (also 4-0 and an experienced amateur) in a six-round bout on an ESPN2 Friday Night Fights but received glowing remarks from ESPN boxing analyst Teddy Atlas, who scored the fight for Pearson 57-56. After the draw with Washington, Pearson steadily began to climb up the Super Featherweight(Junior Lightweight) ranks (130 lbs/59 kg), reeling off eleven consecutive wins. This led to his first regional title bout on December 8, 2000. It was also his first bout against a well-known fighter, as he took on ex-contender and southpaw Harold Warren for the vacant NABA Super Featherweight Title. Warren, a 40-year-old former two- time world title challenger with a record of 42-14, fought valiantly in a closely contested bout, but Pearson staged a dramatic twelfth round knockout to earn the victory. An uppercut to Warren's jaw late in the final round sent him to the canvas, where he was officially counted out at 2:51 of round twelve, vaulting Pearson to his first title. It would be Warren's last bout of a 57-fight professional career. In 2001 in an IBF Super Featherweight Title Eliminator, he would take on another southpaw Carlos Navarro of Los Angeles, with a record 23-1. Pearson began dismantling Navarro from the opening bell, eventually stopping him in ninth round when Navarro's corner threw in the towel just as their fighter hit the canvas for the second time. With the win, Pearson claimed the USBA Super Featherweight Title and a #1 IBF-ranking. Pearson defended the USBA title once before suffering a shock loss. In a non- title bout, Pearson took on last minute replacement Orlando Salido (record 14-8) in a 10-rounder. In a fight Pearson was expected to dominate, he showed signs of vulnerability early, as Salido won many of the early rounds. Pearson came on late in the fight, but it was not enough to earn the victory, as he suffered his first setback in a unanimous decision loss. (For Salido this sensational upset would lead to a string of eight consecutive wins‚Äîand a failed first world title opportunity against Juan Manuel M√°rquez in 2004 and later the winning of a world title in 2006, where claimed the IBF Featherweight crown against Robert Guerrero.) After two more wins Pearson got a world title fight anyway, in December 2002, with his record at 19-1-1, he went to Bangkok, Thailand to challenge reigning WBA champion Yodsanan 3-K Battery/Sor Nanthachai for the WBA Super Featherweight title. The bout took place on beloved King Bhumibol's birthday, a national holiday in Thailand, at the Royal Square in front of a reported 75,000 fans. Pearson fought valiantly, but a broken right hand suffered in the second round all but dashed any hopes off pulling off the upset. An awkward landing punch caused the injury, and Pearson had limited use of the hand for the remaining rounds of the fight. He would suffer his first professional knockdown in the ninth round, and eventually his first knockout loss when he was floored and counted out at 1:46 of round nine from a Nanthachai body shot. Eight months later, in August 2003, Pearson would again fight for the USBA Super Featherweight title against Australian Robbie Peden. Early in the fight, Pearson began showing discomfort in his surgically repaired right hand. Despite the injury, he fought Peden competitively over the first six rounds before he was forced to retire in his corner before the seventh round. The loss led to a 17-month layoff for Pearson in order to have additional surgery performed on his hand, and allow ample healing time. (Peden eventually became the IBF Super Featherweight champion with a win over Nate Campbell in 2005.) By September 2005, Pearson was again fighting for the USBA Super Featherweight title‚Äîthis time at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, Virginia. His opponent would be Brooklyn southpaw Shamir Reyes, who came in with an 18-3-2 record, Pearson stopped him with a bodyshot in the sixth. In July 2006, Pearson re-emerged in the national spotlight to take on another southpaw in former WBA Super Featherweight titleholder Joel Casamayor on an ESPN2's Friday Night Fights broadcast from Phoenix, Arizona. The bout, scheduled for ten rounds, would be Pearson's first time fighting as a lightweight in a significant bout. Casamayor outgunned Pearson for many of the first eight rounds before the bout was stopped due to a cut around Pearson's right eye in the 9th round. (Casamayor would claim the WBC lightweight title in his next bout with a victory over Diego Corrales.) External links * Category:Boxers from Washington, D.C.

The house is in the parish of Hope under Dinmore south of Leominster and is a Grade I listed building, which is the highest category of architecture in the statutory protection scheme.http://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/10566/ Parish Map - Ecclesiastical Parish of Hope-under-Dinmore. Civil parish very similar, see Herefordshire County Council - Civil Parishes.  History  Hampton Court dates from 1427. Sir Rowland Lenthall built the original house on an estate which had been granted to him some years previously on his marriage to the king's cousin Margaret Fitzalan, a daughter of the Earl of Arundel. Informally the grant occurred in the time of Henry (of) Bolingbroke, as King Henry IV was due to the Wars of the Roses which was a complex and intermittent civil war widely described as a cousins' monarchal feud before he gave it to Lenthall. Sir Rowland's house was a quadrangular courtyard house and has retained this basic form. In other ways the house has been significantly altered.  Successive owners  It was owned by the noble Coningsby family from 1510 until 1781, when it was inherited by George Capel, Viscount Malden, son of the 4th Earl of Essex. He changed his name to Capel-Coningsby and remodelled the building to the designs of the architect James Wyatt. In 1810 the estate was purchased by John Arkwright, the grandson of the inventor and industrialist Richard Arkwright. Some of the original oak panelling was taken probably during the 17th century to Wickton Court, a grand house near Leominster and remains a feature of its living room. The house was remodelled in the 1830s and 1840s to restore a castle-like layout, exterior and decoration, reversing earlier attempts to make it appear more regular and domestic. It was sold by John Stanhope Arkwright in 1910 followed by a gradual succession of conveyances. Between 1924 and 1972 it was the seat of Viscount Hereford and was bought by American businessman Robert Van Kampen in 1994. He died in 1999. The formal gardens were opened with a celebration by the family in the year 2000, where the Indiana Wesleyan University Chorale was featured as a sacred choir and some members as a small madrigal choir. Hampton Court Castle and grounds were sold by the Van Kampen family in 2008. In January 2016, the house was for sale at the price of ¬£12M, having been advertised for sale for more than a year at prices of up to ¬£16M. It was described as part of a property with 26 bedrooms and 25 bathrooms. It also includes a conservatory designed by Joseph Paxton.  Gardens  The sunken garden, with waterfall The gardens are a particular feature, and include an organically managed kitchen garden, as well as a maze, a secret tunnel, Dutch garden, island pavilions and a 150-year-old wisteria arch. Hampton Court has a garden which was largely created by the Van Kampens and is open to the public throughout the summer months, and now offers special events such as outdoor theatre productions, small concerts and family days out. The house (empty) and grounds featured extensively in the first season of the 1970s BBC television series Survivors, filmed in spring and summer of 1975.

Van Kampen (1938‚Äì1999) was a businessman and member of various organizational boards in the business world and Christian ministry. Van Kampen's business career took him into the investment banking world, and he became one of the wealthiest men in the United States after founding the investment banking firm Van Kampen Merritt in 1974. In the 1990s, Van Kampen developed what is known today in evangelical Christian eschatology as the \\"Pre-Wrath‚Äù rapture position, authoring three books on the subject. Biography Born in Chicago, Illinois, Van Kampen was educated at Wheaton Academy in West Chicago and Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois, graduating in 1960. =Van Kampen Merritt= In 1968 at age 30, Van Kampen left a secure sales job at a prominent Chicago-based municipal bond firm where he was known as \\"The Charger\\". After affiliations with two other firms, in 1974, at a company in which he owned the majority interest, he led that firm's initiative to sponsor unit investment trusts paying federally tax-exempt interest. His firm was a pioneer in promoting insured unit investment trusts. After New York City's near-default in 1975, investors flocked to Van Kampen's insured trusts. In 1982, the company broke records in the industry by introducing a $125 million Insured Municipal Income Trust (IMIT), soon followed by an even larger $128.5 IMIT. By 1983, the company then known as Van Kampen Merritt, Inc. had sold nearly $7 billion of trusts and was the nation's third-largest firm in that arena.Milestones Historical Consultants: History of Van Kampen In 1984, Van Kampen sold the firm to Xerox Corporation for about $200 million. =Later businesses= As an evangelical Christian, Van Kampen was known for applying biblical principles to the running of his business, and there was a strict code of personal conduct among his many employees. Divorce was frowned upon and the drinking of hard liquor discouraged.The Holy Land Experience ‚Äì Blending 20 Centuries Into a Living Bible Museum =Published works= Van Kampen's published work primarily focused upon development of the \\"pre-wrath rapture\\" position within Evangelical Protestant Christian eschatology. His three published books were: * \\"The Sign\\" ‚Äì A discourse on the \\"end times,\\" focusing on the \\"Pre-Wrath Rapture\\" * The Fourth Reich ‚Äì A novel about the \\"end times\\": Adolf Hitler's spirit is released from Hell and enters an embryo created from his cloned DNA. He's then born in Russia and grows up to become that country's dictator, eventually revealing his true identity to the world before the UN General Assembly. Van Kampen also stated that Hitler \\"best meets all requirements to be the Antichrist\\" in his former book, The Sign * The Rapture Question Answered =Trust= The family now controls his former assets worth approximately $200 million. A family foundation owns one of the largest private collections of rare and antique Bibles in North America, presently housed in the Scriptorium at the Holy Land Experience in Orlando, Florida. The trust also owned Hampton Court, Herefordshire, a later medieval country house converted into a Christian study centre. In the decade until it was sold in January 2008, approximately ¬£12 million was invested into the restoration of Hampton Court and its surrounding parkland, including the creation of the nationally significant Van Kampen garden.http://www.hamptoncourt.org.uk/news/article_dtl.asp?article_id=1 There was a grand opening for the garden after his death in the summer of 2000, in which he had donated $100,000 for the Indiana Wesleyan University Chorale to come and perform for the Grand Opening. =Personal life= In 1963 he married, and he and his wife had three children.

Artin and B. Mazur. Ann. Sci. √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure 10 (1977), 87-131. P. 90. These have also been called Artin supersingular K3 surfaces. Supersingular K3 surfaces can be considered the most special and interesting of all K3 surfaces. Definitions and main results More generally, a smooth projective variety X over a field of characteristic p > 0 is called supersingular if all slopes of Frobenius on the crystalline cohomology Ha(X,W(k)) are equal to a/2, for all a. In particular, this gives the standard notion of a supersingular abelian variety. For a variety X over a finite field Fq, it is equivalent to say that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the l-adic cohomology Ha(X,Ql) are equal to qa/2 times roots of unity. It follows that any variety in positive characteristic whose l-adic cohomology is generated by algebraic cycles is supersingular. A K3 surface whose l-adic cohomology is generated by algebraic cycles is sometimes called a Shioda supersingular K3 surface. Since the second Betti number of a K3 surface is always 22, this property means that the surface has 22 independent elements in its Picard group (œÅ = 22). From what we have said, a K3 surface with Picard number 22 must be supersingular. Conversely, the Tate conjecture would imply that every supersingular K3 surface over an algebraically closed field has Picard number 22. This is now known in every characteristic p except 2, since the Tate conjecture was proved for all K3 surfaces in characteristic p at least 3 by Nygaard-Ogus (1985), , , and . To see that K3 surfaces with Picard number 22 exist only in positive characteristic, one can use Hodge theory to prove that the Picard number of a K3 surface in characteristic zero is at most 20. In fact the Hodge diamond for any complex K3 surface is the same (see classification), and the middle row reads 1, 20, 1. In other words, h2,0 and h0,2 both take the value 1, with h1,1 = 20. Therefore, the dimension of the space spanned by the algebraic cycles is at most 20 in characteristic zero; surfaces with this maximum value are sometimes called singular K3 surfaces. Another phenomenon which can only occur in positive characteristic is that a K3 surface may be unirational. Michael Artin observed that every unirational K3 surface over an algebraically closed field must have Picard number 22. (In particular, a unirational K3 surface must be supersingular.) Conversely, Artin conjectured that every K3 surface with Picard number 22 must be unirational.M. Artin. Ann. Sci. √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure 7 (1974), 543-567. P. 552. Artin's conjecture was proved in characteristic 2 by . Proofs in every characteristic p at least 5 were claimed by and , but later refuted by . History The first example of a K3 surface with Picard number 22 was given by , who observed that the Fermat quartic :w4 \\\\+ x4 \\\\+ y4 \\\\+ z4 = 0 has Picard number 22 over algebraically closed fields of characteristic 3 mod 4. Then Shioda showed that the elliptic modular surface of level 4 (the universal generalized elliptic curve E(4) ‚Üí X(4)) in characteristic 3 mod 4 is a K3 surface with Picard number 22, as is the Kummer surface of the product of two supersingular elliptic curves in odd characteristic. showed that all K3 surfaces with Picard number 22 are double covers of the projective plane. In the case of characteristic 2 the double cover may need to be an inseparable covering. The discriminant of the intersection form on the Picard group of a K3 surface with Picard number 22 is an even power :p2e of the characteristic p, as was shown by Artin and Milne. Here e is called the Artin invariant of the K3 surface. Artin showed that :1 ‚â§ e ‚â§ 10. There is a corresponding Artin stratification of the moduli spaces of supersingular K3 surfaces, which have dimension 9. The subspace of supersingular K3 surfaces with Artin invariant e has dimension e ‚àí 1. Examples In characteristic 2, :z2 = f(x, y) , for a sufficiently general polynomial f(x, y) of degree 6, defines a surface with 21 isolated singularities. The smooth projective minimal model of such a surface is a unirational K3 surface, and hence a K3 surface with Picard number 22. The largest Artin invariant here is 10. Similarly, in characteristic 3, :z3 = g(x, y) , for a sufficiently general polynomial g(x, y) of degree 4, defines a surface with 9 isolated singularities. The smooth projective minimal model of such a surface is again a unirational K3 surface, and hence a K3 surface with Picard number 22. The highest Artin invariant in this family is 6. described the supersingular K3 surface in characteristic 2 with Artin number 1 in detail. Kummer surfaces If the characteristic p is greater than 2, showed that every K3 surface S with Picard number 22 and Artin invariant at most 2 is a Kummer surface, meaning the minimal resolution of the quotient of an abelian surface A by the mapping x ‚Ü¶ ‚àí x. More precisely, A is a supersingular abelian surface, isogenous to the product of two supersingular elliptic curves.

His league and championship career at senior level with the Dublin county team spanned sixteen seasons from 1964 to 1979. Born in Clontarf, Hanahoe excelled at both Gaelic football and hurling in his youth. He was educated at St. Joseph's Secondary School Fairview where he first developed his skills in both codes. Hanahoe joined the St. Vincent's club and, after progressing through the juvenile and underage grades, was a regular member of the starting fifteen by 1964. He won the first of eleven county senior championship medals that year, however, the highlight of his club career came in 1976 when he won an All-Ireland medal. Hanahoe also won three Leinster medals before retiring after a two-decade-long career. Hanahoe made his debut on the inter-county scene when he lined out for Dublin as a dual player in the respective minor grades. After little success, he made his senior debut in a challenge game in 1964. Over the course of the next fifteen years, Hanahoe won three All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in 1974, followed by back-to-back triumphs as captain in 1976 and 1977. He also won six Leinster medals, two National Football League medals and one All Star. He played his last game for Dublin in September 1979. Hanahone was in the twilight of his career when he was picked for the Leinster inter-provincial team. He ended his career without a Railway Cup medal. Even during his playing days Hanahoe became involved in team management. He succeeded Kevin Heffernan as player-manager of Dublin in 1977 and guided the team to a second successive All-Ireland title. Biography Hanahoe was born in Clontarf, Dublin in 1945. He was educated locally by the Christian Brothers at Scoil Mhuire in Marino and later at St. Joseph's Fairview, affectionately known as ‚ÄòJoey‚Äôs‚Äô, in Fairview. There was no sporting tradition in Hanahoe's family, however, it was at these schools that his interest at Gaelic games was developed. Hanahoe later attended Trinity College, Dublin where he qualified with a degree in law. He subsequently worked as a solicitor and has worked with victims of the Stardust disaster Football career =Club= Hanahoe played his club hurling and club football with the famous St. Vincent's club in Dublin. With the club he won eleven Dublin SFC titles in 1964, 1966, 1967, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1981 and 1984. One of these wins was converted into an All-Ireland title in 1976. Hanahoe also won Dublin SHC titles with the club in 1964, 1967 and 1975. =Inter-county= Hanahoe played both minor hurling and football with Dublin in the early 1960s. He played in the Leinster minor final of 1963, however, his side were defeated by Westmeath. Later that same year Hanahoe got trials with the senior team in both sports. He subsequently secured a spot on Dublin's senior football team and made his debut in 1964. In 1965 Hanahoe the left the Dublin team and put his sporting career on hold. He returned in 1970 when Kevin Heffernan was manager of the side. By this stage Dublin's football fortunes were at an all-time low. This low ebb culminated in a defeat by Kildare in the 1972 Leinster final. Hanahoe was captain that day and it was feared at the time that all the players would be sacked along with the management team. Hanahoe played no part in the 1973 championship but he returned in 1974 and Kevin Heffernan was appointed manager once again. That year Hanahoe claimed his first Leinster title before later going on to beat Galway to claim his first All-Ireland medal. In 1975 Dublin retained their provincial title with Hanahoe playing a key role in the full-forward line. His side, however, were later defeated by an up-and-coming Kerry side. In 1976 Hanahoe was appointed captain of Dublin. Under his leadership Dublin captured another Leinster title before gaining revenge over Kerry for the previous year's defeat. It was Dublin's nineteenth All-Ireland title and it was Hanahoe's second. Hanahoe also became one of only seven men to have been presented the Sam Maguire Cup twice as captain. His performance in the championship earned him his sole All-Star award. Following the conclusion of the 1976 championship, Kevin Heffernan unexpectedly stepped down as Dublin manager. Hanahoe was somewhat pushed into accepting the vacant position. He now had the unenviable task of being captain of the side as well as the manager. In spite of this pressure, he captured another Leinster title in 1977. He later led Dublin to victory against Kerry before later claiming his third All-Ireland medal following an emphatic victory over Armagh.https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2007/0824/1187332465662.html Irish Times interview with Tony Hanahoe In 1978 Hanahoe retained his dual role as captain and manager. He captured his fifth Leinster title in-a-row before leading Dublin into their fifth All-Ireland final in-a-row. Dublin were the red hot favourites to complete the three-in-a-row, however, Kerry were back on form. The game itself is remembered for Mikey Sheehy‚Äôs cheeky goal which he scored by lobbing the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen. It was an emphatic victory for Kerry on a score line of 5-11 to 0-9. In 1979 Heffernan returned as manager, however, Hanahoe retained the captaincy of the team. He captured his sixth Leinster title which allowed Dublin to advance to their sixth All- Ireland final appearance in-a-row. Once again Hanahoe's side faced Kerry. Dublin were outplayed in the final once again and Hanahoe ended up on the losing side. This defeat brought an end to the great Dublin team of the 1970s. Hanahoe retired from inter-county football shortly after.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed 2012-02-11 perennial stream located in San Mateo County, California, United States which discharges into South San Francisco Bay. The Port of Redwood City, the largest deepwater port in South San Francisco Bay, is situated on the east bank of Redwood Creek near its mouth, where the creek becomes a natural deepwater channel. History The creek and city name, the latter first known as Red Woods City (1854), was named because of the nearby coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forest and lumbering industry. In 1851, a deep-water channel that ran inland to what is now Redwood City was discovered off of San Francisco Bay. Named Redwood Creek, this channel was used by the lumber companies to ship wood and logs from the redwood forests in the peninsula hills to San Francisco. A shipbuilding industry emerged, the first schooner was built in 1851 by G.M. Burnham and appropriately named \\"Redwood.\\" Wooden shipbuilding remained an active industry until the last wooden ship built in Redwood City, called the \\"Perseverance,\\" was launched in 1883. The shipbuilding industry experienced a revival in 1918 with the building of the first concrete ship in America, the SS Faith. Watershed Redwood Creek begins in the Woodside Glens neighborhood of Woodside, California just south of Interstate 280, below the terminus of Farm Hill Boulevard. It descends below Interstate 280 on the west side of Woodside Road, passing through the Menlo Country Club. At Alameda de las Pulgas it becomes an engineered concrete channel to El Camino Real, where it is briefly daylighted before entering underground culverts in downtown Redwood City. The primary tributary to Redwood Creek is a stream named Arroyo Ojo de Agua which meets it underground at approximately Broadway Street in Redwood City. As it crosses below US Highway 101 it becomes a tidal channel. Extensive mudflats and marsh areas are found along Redwood Creek near its mouth. Several side channel sloughs connect to Redwood Creek, the largest of which is Westpoint Slough. Ecology Redwood Creek and Arroyo Ojo de Agua were fish sampled for steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in 1981, but no trout were found. The historical status of trout in the creek is unknown. At Stulsaft Park on the Arroyo de Ojo Agua tributary, a population of endangered Fountain Thistle (Cirsium fontinale var. fontinale) was discovered in 2007, and occupies seeps associated with serpentine soils. In Stulsaft Park it is found in an opening in a coffeeberry/bay laurel woodland. The plants may grow 6 feet tall and it is only found in a handful of locations in San Mateo County. In August, 2018 Grassroots Ecology Assistant Director Junko Bryant led a project with the San Jose Conservation Corps and Redwood City to remove approximately 40 non-native Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) trees from a segment of Redwood Creek in the downtown area near Kaiser Permanente. These palm trees, some over 5 feet in diameter, had overtaken the creek bank and completely obscured public views of the creek. The creek banks have been replanted with native plants, increasing biological diversity and improving visibility for ambulances accessing the hospital.

Circular A-130 was first issued in December 1985 to meet information resource management requirements that were included in the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980. Specifically, the PRA assigned responsibility to the OMB Director to develop and maintain a comprehensive set of information resources management policies for use across the Federal government, and to promote the application of information technology to improve the use and dissemination of information in the operation of Federal programs.(See \\"Background\\" section of Circular's Transmittal Memorandum No. 2 for brief historical information) The initial release of the Circular provided a policy framework for information resources management (IRM) across the Federal government. Since the time of the Circular's first release in 1985, Congress has enacted several additional laws and OMB issued several guidance documents that related to information technology management in federal agencies. To account for these new laws and guidance, OMB has revised the Circular three times, in 1994,1994 (Transmittal No. 2) 1996,1996 (Transmittal No. 3) and 2000.2000 (Transmittal No. 4) A complete rewrite of the Circular to both update and to correct for known deficiencies has been considered since at least 2005,\\"OMB considers A-130 rewrite\\", FCW March 2005 but as of October 2014, this rewrite has not yet occurred.

It concerns the town of Dover, the most likely \\"frontline\\" in any potential German invasion and how it had persevered since 1940. The film, which stars Edward R. Murrow, opens with a look back at the circumstances of mid-1940, how the British had arrived there after Dunkirk, the continuous air raids during the battle of Britain, and the stoicism of the people as they prepared to \\"die with their boots on\\" when the invasion came. Now, two years later, Dover is still the front line, but not for defence, for offence. RAF planes control the skies and more Allied sorties are flown over German targets than German raids on Britain. The people have stoically and bravely gone on with their normal lives, while helping the war effort; most of the men are in the forces, while the women man the anti-aircraft guns.

The Tyne and Wear Metro station at Whitley Bay was opened in August 1980. The station is located in a residential area, and is a short walk from both the town centre and the beach, which attracts many of its passengers. The station was used by approximately 530,000 passengers in 2017-18. Station facilities include a caf√©, cycle parking, and limited free car parking. There is also a bus stop (used by the W1, W1A & W2 routes), and a taxi rank outside the station. History In 1860, the Blyth and Tyne Railway opened its line from Tynemouth to Dairy House Junction, south of the Northumbrian village of Hartley. The original station serving the town was named Whitley, and was located around 600 metres west of the present station site. However, this was only open for four years, being closed in 1864 and replaced by a station to the north, adjacent to present day Monkseaton station. In 1882, the North Eastern Railway opened its coastal route from Tynemouth to Monkseaton, replacing the inland Blyth and Tyne route, and a new station designed by William Bell was opened the same year, also called Whitley (this station being renamed Whitley Bay in 1899).M. Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in Great Britain - A Chronology. p. 410. Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2005. . From 1904, the station was served by the electric trains of the North Eastern Railway.J.C Gillham, The Age of the Electric Train - Electric Trains in Britain since 1883, Ian Allan, 1988, p.36-7. The electric services became so popular with people living in Whitley Bay and travelling to Newcastle to work, and also with those visiting the town for a day out or a holiday, that a new station became a necessity.G. Biddle, Britain's Historic Railway Buildings, Oxford University Press, 2003, p.396-7 The new building opened in October 1910.M. Quick, p. 410. Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner later said of the building that it \\"(lends) some distinction to an undistinguished neighbourhood\\".N. Pevsner et al, The Buildings of England: Northumberland. Yale University Press 2002, p.626. The \\"Tyneside Electrics\\" were withdrawn by British Rail in 1967, and replaced by diesel multiple unit trains. The diesel trains provided a slower service, and trains called at intervals of every 30 minutes instead of every 20, although a limited-stop express service also called every hour. In preparation for its second conversion to electric train operation, this time to join the Tyne and Wear Metro system, the station lost its services towards Newcastle via Monkseaton on 23 January 1978, and was closed completely on 10 September 1979. It reopened on 11 August 1980, the first day of Metro service.Quick, p.410 The main changes involved in the station's conversion were shortening of the train shed at each end of the platforms and replacement of the original footbridge, with no further major changes having been made as of 2014. The station's main building and train shed were given Grade II listed building status in 1986. Service & Frequency The station's north entrance featuring the well-known clock tower Whitley Bay is served by the Yellow Line (running from South Shields to Newcastle City Centre, Whitley Bay, Wallsend & St. James). This line runs up to every 12 minutes during the day (Monday to Saturday), and up to every 15 minutes in the evenings and on a Sunday. Station artwork In 1983, the artwork Passing by Ian Patience was installed in the entrance hall to platform 2. It depicts a family on a day trip to the beach and also shows a nocturnal seascape in the central panel.

It was dedicated to Tedald, Bishop of Arezzo. This treatise outlines singing and teaching practice for Gregorian chant, and has considerable discussion of the composition of polyphonic music. This treatise discusses modified parallel organum as well as free organum. The examples given are in two voices, set note-against-note, and the voices are frequently permitted to cross. He advised against use of the perfect fifth and minor second, favouring instead the major second and perfect fourth (though thirds were also permitted). One point of importance is his guideline for the occursus (meaning \\"meeting\\" or \\"concurrence\\", running on the same path), which is a predecessor of the later cadence. An occursus occurs where two voices approach a unison. He suggested that the unison should be approached either by contrary motion from a major third, or oblique motion from a major second.Hoppin, Richard H. Medieval Music. Norton, 1978, pp. 194-195.

Meath in Ireland.Stalmans and Charles-Edwards, \\"Meath, saints of (act. c.400‚Äìc.900)\\" Cen√©l L√≥egairi, Trim and Armagh Trim (Ath Truimm) was the foremost church in the petty kingdom of the Cen√©l L√≥egairi, originally belonging to a cadet branch of that dynasty. In the early 8th century, however, the patronage of the church came under serious strain as power shifts occurred within the main ruling branch. Between the early 8th and mid-9th century, descendants of Colm√°n mac Duib Duin ruled the monastery.√ì Corr√°in, \\"Ireland c. 800\\", p. 586. The cadet branch appears to have negotiated the position of the saint, turning to St Patrick's church at Armagh for mediation. By way of compromise, Lomm√°n was drawn into the dossier of St Patrick as someone biologically related and subordinate to that saint. An 8th-century text in the Book of Armagh first attests to Lomm√°n's new status. It states that through his mother, Lomm√°n was a kinsman of the saint as well as of a number of other local saints of the 5th century, including Munis (buried in Forgney) and Mo Gen√≥c (Mugen√≥c) of Cell Duma Glind (Kilglyn).Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, p. 32. According to the foundation story, Lomm√°n joined St Patrick on his voyage to Ireland, landing at the estuary of the Boyne (according to Muirch√∫, at Inber Colpthai), and continued in his ship as far as Trim, where he founded the monastery.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, p. 16. The Patrician influence is also attested in a later gloss to the Martyrology of Tallaght, which identifies Lomm√°n as porter ((h)ostiarius) to St Patrick.Martyrology of Tallaght, 17 February. Tripartite Life Although the cadet branch in control of Lomm√°n's church lost out, Lomm√°n remained an element of St Patrick's cult, notably re-appearing in the Tripartite Life of Patrick, written in the 10th century. It tells that Lomm√°n was a nephew of Patrick, his mother being a sister of Patrick, and that his brothers were Munis, Broccaid of Imliuch Ech, Brocc√°n and Mo Gen√≥c. When at Patrick's instructions, the saint rowed to Trim, he arrived at the fortress belonging to the local ruler Feidlimid son of L√≥egaire mac N√©ill. He first converted Feidlimid's son Foirtchernn (Fortchern) and subsequently Feidlimid himself, whose wife, named Scoth (Scotnoe), was daughter to the British king. Feidlimid welcomed the saint and granted him Trim, where Patrick founded a monastery and left it in Lomm√°n's charge. Foirtchernn became his fosterson and with him he visited his brother Broccaid towards the end of his life. Lomm√°n bequeathed the church to both Patrick and Foirtchernn. Foirtchernn, though initially reluctant, accepted and after the death of his fosterfather, held the abbey for only three days, transferring it to the pilgrim Cathlaid in his stead. Death and Veneration His feast-day was observed on 17 February and on 11 October.

He is known mainly for his four-volume history of the First Republic of Armenia. Biography =Background= Hovannisian was born and raised in Tulare, California into a family of Armenian Genocide survivors. His father, Gaspar Gavroian, was born in 1901 in the village of Bazmashen (Pazmashen; now Sarƒ±√ßubuk, Turkey), near Kharpert in the Ottoman Empire. Fleeing the genocide of 1915, he moved to the United States by 1920 and changed his last name from Gavroian to Hovannisian, after his father's name, Hovhannes. In 1926, Kaspar married Siroon (Sarah) Nalbandian, also a child of genocide survivors. Their two sons were born in 1928 (John) and 1930 (Ralph). Richard Gable Hovannisian (named after Clark Gable) was born last on November 9, 1932. Hovannisian married Vartiter Kotcholosian in 1957 at the Holy Trinity Armenian Church of Fresno. They had four children, Raffi, Armen, Ani, and Garo. Raffi later went on to become the first Foreign Minister of Armenia and is currently an opposition politician. =Education and career= Hovannisian received his B.A. in history (1954) from the University of California, Berkeley, and his M.A. in history (1958) and his Ph.D. (1966) from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).Hovannisian, Richard G. \\"Confronting the Genocide,\\" in Pioneers of Genocide Studies, eds. Samuel Totten and Steven Leonard Jacobs. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2002, p. 31. He was also an associate professor of history at Mount St. Mary's College, Los Angeles, from 1966 to 1969, having joined UCLA in 1962. A Rankean by training, Hovannisian's scholarly work early on was focused on the history of the First Republic of Armenia (1918‚Äì20). His Ph.D. dissertation, originally envisioned to encompass its entire history, was published in 1967 as Armenia on the Road to Independence and would serve as a prologue to the four volumes (1971-1996) that he would eventually publish on the history of the republic. These volumes were generally well-received among scholarly circles. In 1986, Hovannisian was appointed as the first holder of the Armenian Educational Foundation Endowed Chair in Modern Armenian History at UCLA. Hovannisian is a Guggenheim Fellow who has received numerous honors for his scholarship, civic activities, and advancement of Armenian Studies. His biographical entries are included in Who's Who in America and Who's Who in the World among other scholarly and literary reference works.. Hovannisian serves on the board of directors of nine scholarly and civic organizations, including the Facing History and Ourselves Foundation; the International Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide; International Alert; the Foundation for Research on Armenian Architecture; and the Armenian National Institute (ANI).Biography He received the UCLA Alumni Association's 2010-2011 \\"Most Inspiring Teacher\\" award.Professor Richard Hovannisian to be Honored as Most Distinguished Teacher.

Cooke, February 26, 2014, National Review, Yes, Atheism and Conservatism are Possible: You needn‚Äôt believe in God to believe in the American constitutional order, Retrieved November 6, 2015, \\"...If atheism and conservatism are incompatible, then I am not a conservative. And nor, I am given to understand, are George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Anthony Daniels, Walter Olson, Heather Mac Donald, James Taranto, Allahpundit, or S. E. Cupp....\\" She is a Thomas W. Smith Fellow of the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of the institute's City Journal. She has written numerous editorials and is the author of several books. She is known for her pro-police views and her opposition to criminal justice reform, as expressed in her book The War on Cops and columns such as \\"The Myth of the Racist Cop\\" and \\"The Myth of Systemic Police Racism.\\" Early life Heather Mac Donald was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Robert (an attorney) and Elouise MacDonald. She added the space to her surname independently. In 1978 she graduated from Yale University with a BA summa cum laude in English.1985 Yale Alumni Directory, p. 501. After receiving a Mellon Fellowship from Yale, she attended Clare College, Cambridge University, earning an MA in English. While at Cambridge she also studied in Italy. In 1985 she graduated with a Juris Doctor degree from Stanford University Law School. Positions Mac Donald refers to herself as a secular conservative. She has argued that conservatism is superior to liberalism by virtue of the ideas alone, and that religion should not affect the argument and is unnecessary for conservatism. Mac Donald maintains that conservative values like small government, self-reliance and liberty can be defended without \\"recourse to invisible deities or the religions that exalt them.\\" She has advocated positions on numerous subjects including victimization, philanthropy, immigration reform, crime prevention, racism, racial profiling, rape, politics, welfare, and matters pertaining to cities and academia. Mac Donald has criticized welfare and philanthropic institutions such as the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation for suggesting that welfare is a right; in particular, she has criticized welfare because \\"generations have grown up fatherless and dependent\\". She has written that welfare programs serve as a \\"dysfunction enabler\\" and that food stamps cause an \\"unhealthy dependence\\". According to Mac Donald, under American immigration policies, the United States has been \\"importing another underclass\\", one with the \\"potential to expand indefinitely.\\" During the coronavirus pandemic, she criticized March 2020 shelter-in-place policies as \\"unbridled panic\\". She argued that the coronavirus would have a similar casualty rate as the flu. Medical journals, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control have, however, estimated that the coronavirus is substantially deadlier. In a 2019 op-ed titled, \\"Trump Isn‚Äôt the One Dividing Us by Race\\", she argued that Democrats and the media are at fault for racial divisions in the United States. She argued that it is those on the left who have emboldened white supremacists. She argued that Donald Trump is not racially divisive because he \\"rarely uses racial categories in his speech or his tweets.\\" = Policing and national security = Mac Donald has been described as \\"pro-police\\". She rejects that police are systematically racist, calling it \\"false narrative.\\" She has called for a return to \\"stop-and-frisk\\" tactics and \\"zero-tolerance\\" policing. She has argued that too much criticism of police brutality has made police fearful of engaging in proactive policing, and that this has caused more crime. She has been a vocal critic of Black Lives Matter, an international human rights movement originating in the African-American community that campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. While talking to the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, she accused President Barack Obama of \\"attacking the very foundation of civilization\\" by giving credibility to Black Lives Matter. During the 2016 presidential election, she described a speech by Donald Trump on criminal justice as \\"a radical, bold, and important change of course in the prevailing discourse about policing and crime.\\" She is an outspoken critic of criminal justice reform, such as the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which she testified against in October 2015. She has spoken out against no-racial- profiling programs for the police, calling them a \\"politically correct ignoring\\" of what is known to be the \\"logical necessity of Islamic terrorisms.\\" She has criticized efforts to instate no-racial-profiling policies, calling these efforts an \\"illogical tautology\\" because \\"you cannot be an Islamic terrorist unless you're a member of the Muslim faith\\". She has defended the Patriot Act and argued for secrecy and speed in handling problems as well as the sharing of information between departments within the intelligence community, and advocated that the benefits of government power be balanced against the risks of abuse. She stated that the interrogation techniques promulgated in the war on terror were \\"light years\\" from real torture and \\"hedged around\\" with bureaucratic safeguards. In her 2005 testimony to Congress, she claimed that 95% of outstanding homicide warrants in Los Angeles were for undocumented immigrants and that 75% of L.A.'s most wanted list comprised undocumented immigrants. Fact checks by PolitiFact and Snopes found no evidence for those assertions; Mac Donald told PolitiFact in 2020 that the figures were a \\"rough estimate\\" given to her by an unnamed member of the Los Angeles Police Department. In September 2019 congressional testimony, Mac Donald cited a July 2019 PNAS study on the races of police officers and civilians who are shot, which purported to show that there was no racial bias in police shootings. However, the study that she cited has been corrected, and the editors of the journal wrote that the study was unable to support any conclusions about racial bias in police shootings. One of the study's authors, University of Maryland psychology professor David Johnson, told CityLab that he was \\"not happy\\" with the way Mac Donald has characterized the study. The authors of the study later called for its retraction, saying that the study continued to be misused, with the authors specifically mentioning editorials by Mac Donald. Reviews of her books Writing in the New York Times in 2000, Robin Finn described Mac Donald as an \\"influential institute thinker who risks being stereotyped as a right-leaning academic curmudgeon\\". Columnist George F. Will wrote a blurb for Mac Donald's book The Burden of Bad Ideas (2000) that praised her thinking about urban problems. In the New York Times, Allen D. Boyer wrote a positive brief review of The Burden of Bad Ideas, concluding that \\"among discussions of urban malaise, where so much hot air has been recycled, this book has the freshness of a stiff, changing breeze\\". Tim Lynch, director of the Cato Institute's project on criminal justice, gave her 2016 book The War on Cops a negative review in Reason, concluding, \\"What Mac Donald calls a 'war on cops' is better described as a much-needed debate about crime, law enforcement tactics, and how to deal with systemic police misconduct,\\" and adding, \\"Conservatives have some worthwhile ideas to offer in this debate, but Mac Donald's polemics add heat, not light.\\" Steven Pinker, Charles Murray and Shelby Steele were featured in blurbs for Mac Donald's 2018 book The Diversity Delusion. Pinker, professor of psychology at Harvard University, wrote that \\"with her spitfire writing and scorn for nonsense she is forcing universities to live up to their own principles.\\" Murray, an American Enterprise Institute scholar, said the book was \\"crammed with facts and numbers that universities go to great lengths to hide.\\" Steele, a conservative author, wrote, \\"Not since Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind has a book so thoroughly exposed the damage done to American institutions‚Äîparticularly universities‚Äîby modern liberalism's glib commitment to diversity.\\" 2017 protest In spring 2017, a protest group announced plans to \\"shut down\\" Mac Donald's speech on the Black Lives Matter movement at a college campus in California, calling her racist, fascist, and anti-black. On April 7, around 250 protesters surrounded audience members and prevented them from entering the building where she was speaking at Claremont McKenna College, whose president, Hiram Chodosh, afterward said, \\"Based on the judgment of the Claremont Police Department, we jointly concluded that any forced interventions or arrests would have created unsafe conditions for students, faculty, staff, and guests.\\" Mac Donald ultimately gave the talk to a small audience in the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum that was live-streamed on Claremont McKenna's website. Chodosh claimed that \\"the effort to silence her voice effectively amplified it to a much larger audience.\\" The college subsequently suspended seven students.

A beggarwoman told her to mark how they slept, and then the youngest, who slept with her hands in her lap, was ill-fated, and her fate kept her sisters from being married. The youngest daughter heard this, told her mother to sew her dowry into the hem of her skirt, dressed herself as a nun, and left, despite her mother's pleas. She stayed at a cloth- dealer's, but her fate came and tore up the cloth, and they turned her out; she paid for the damage from her dowry and went on. She stayed at a glass- merchant's, but her fate came and smashed the glass; she paid for the damage and went on. Then she took service with a queen, who realized she had an evil Fate and kept her on. Finally, the queen told her she had to change her fate: she had to go to the mountain where they lived, and offer her some bread to change her fate. The princess did this, and would not leave until her fate took the bread; the fate resisted a long time, even when the other fates argued with her, but finally gave her silk thread and told her to give it away only for its weight in gold. A nearby king was marrying, and a quantity of silk was missing to sew the bride's dress. The princess brought her silk; it was perfect, and they set out to give her the gold, but nothing would even out the scale, until the king himself stepped on the scales. He said that showed she should have him, and they married.

He was wounded in an ambush in 1919, and he spent the rest of his life in Antalya as a disabled officer. Mustafa Ertuƒürul died in 1964.

See near Kemer in Antalya Province by the skin diver and amphora collector Mustafa Aydemir. A book, based on the account that he had typewritten himself in 1934, on Atat√ºrk's personal encouragement, \\"Ben bir T√ºrk zabitiyim\\" (I am a Turkish officer), was re-edited by Aydemir and supplemented with photographs and archive documents, notably from France. It was published for the first time in 2004, subsequently running into several editions. Prior to Ertuƒürul's account having been made public, easily available information on the officer was restricted to a few lines in the memoirs of Liman von Sanders and Field Marshal Erich Ludendorff and documents and literature regarding Ben-my-Chree's sinking. The commander of Paris II, Henri Rollin was taken prisoner by Ertuƒürul's unit after his ship's sinking and had also presented a detailed official report on Paris II and Alexandra at the end of the war in 1918. Ertuƒürul's story requires more in-depth research, with a number of points included in his account awaiting further clarification, notably his mention of another British naval vessel that he claimed to have sunk and believed to be the actual ship commanded by Charles Rumney Samson; HMS Dard.

During his career, he made many contributions to the study of macroeconomic fluctuations and economic growth over time.  Biography  Born and raised in a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, he completed his bachelor's degree in economics summa cum laude at Harvard University. He went to Harvard with the intention of becoming a lawyer and studied criminal justice as well as economics. However, he became more interested in economics because he was able to connect it to the world in which he was living. He earned his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1939. In 1985, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden.http://www.uu.se/en/about- uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/ In 1992, he was invited to Rome to become a fellow of the prestigious Accademia Nazionale Dei Lincei. He was awarded another doctorate from the University of Ancona in 1992. Abramovitz died at Stanford Hospital in California on December 1, 2000, at the age of 88, after contracting a gastrointestinal infection. Abramovitz, called Moe by family and friends, was known for his modest personality and was described as one of the least ego-driven scholars in economics. He married Carrie Glasser, a Brooklyn-born painter and sculptor, in 1937. She died in 1999. Abramovitz started his career as a lecturer at Harvard in the mid-1930s. After finishing his doctorate at Columbia, he joined the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York, where he began his investigation of inventory investment cycles. During World War II, Abramovitz served on the War Production Board and in the Office of Strategic Services as chief of the European industry and trade section. In 1945 and 1946, he was an economic adviser to the United States representative on the Allied Reparations Commission. He was also a founding faculty member of the Department of Economics at Stanford University, which he joined in the fall of 1948. He taught there for almost 30 years. From 1962 to 1963, he was the adviser to the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. He then served as the organization chair from 1963 to 1965 and from 1971 to 1974. Over the course of his career, Abramovitz carried out many pioneering studies of macroeconomics and long-term growth. His 1986 article, \\"Catching Up, Forging Ahead and Falling Behind\\" is the second most cited of all the papers published by the Journal of Economic History.  Theories  = Catch-up growth = Abramovitz's catch-up growth hypothesis attempted to explain Western Europe's Golden Era of economic growth from 1948 to 1972. He essentially concluded that the key to the growth was Western Europe's ability to import and implement technology from the United States. The growth rate of a developing country will be higher than the growth rate of a developed country because the diminishing return of developing countries is much lower. If a country is trying to be industrialized, it can only be better off; it will grow much faster than countries that are already industrialized. In the process, the country creates more jobs and more capital, which means the economy's total revenue will increase more and more quickly. = Limitation to catch-up growth = Abramovitz's theory does not guarantee that poor countries will catch up to developed countries, because the poor countries might fail to adapt to new technology, attract capital and participate in the global market. If a country cannot adapt to the technology it is offered, it will not be able to generate more capital, which will cause the catch-up process to fail. If the country does not build relationships with developed nations, the process will also fail. Building such relationships is so important because it is developed countries that will purchase most of developing countries' capital. If the developing country sells more capital, it will grow. If it grows, it will catch up. = The role of inventories in business cycles = During his time at the National Bureau of Economics Research, Abramovitz researched the role inventories play in business cycles. A business cycle is a fluctuation in economic activity over a period of time. The fluctuation may be good, as with a boom and economic expansion, or bad, as with a recession or depression. In his paper \\"The Role of Inventories in Business Cycles,\\" Abramovitz wrote that inventory can play a negative role if there is a lag in the production of the inventory. A lag can occur for the following reasons: # Many goods need to be produced to create one whole product. For example, to manufacture a car, several kinds of goods are required. If there is a lag in obtaining any of those goods, it slows down the production of the car. This prevents the market from meeting demand, which leads to less revenue. # Raw materials purchased from domestic manufacturers or dealers may lag by a few months. For example, to make fabric, many types of raw material‚Äîsuch as cotton, nylon, wool, and polyester‚Äîare required. If domestic manufacturers or dealers are unable to produce the raw material on time, the market will suffer because it cannot meet demand. # Raw materials purchased from distant sources or on long-term contracts may also arrive late. When domestic manufacturers and dealers cannot produce enough, a nation has to reach out to other nations, which takes much longer. This can also cause the market to lack products consumers want. # Finished goods made to order are closely tied to output. Even if raw materials are received on time and goods are produced on time, the inventory may not be enough to meet demand. Producing more requires starting from scratch. Meanwhile, the market does not have any goods to sell. Aggregate inventories of wholesalers and retailers also appear to have lagged behind sales by about six months. Detailed studies reveal that this lag reflects large differences in the ability of merchants in different trades to keep the rate at which they receive goods in line with the rate at which they can dispose of them. Some merchants' ability to adjust inventories to sales is so limited as to produce a long lag of stocks behind sales, or even an inverse relationship between sales and inventories. If these various lags are worked out, a country can stop the negative effect of inventories on the national market.

It operated near Warragamba on the outskirts of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia until 1991. There was also a dolphinarium in the African Lion Safari. History African Lion Safari was opened by Stafford Bullen (1925-2001) in 1968. At the time, Bullen was still operating a travelling circus, but in 1969 he gave this venture a permanent home at Bullen's Animal World. For the opening, a promotional single of The Tokens' \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" was recorded by a band using the name \\"The Love machine\\" (the band turned out to be Tymepiece). The safari was popular in its early years and attracted up to 200,000 visitors each year. With the suburbs encroaching on the facility, and extensive work required to upgrade the park following legislative changes, it eventually closed in 1991 but continued to hold animals on site that were used in a circus but not displayed to the public. African Lion Safari originally opened in Warragamba, however sometime after this it relocated to neighbouring Wallacia, where it had a drive through area full of wild animals i.e. lions, bears, and tigers. Incidents On 7 August 1995, several lionesses escaped from the park, roamed the nearby townships of Warragamba and Silverdale, and killed a dog. The lioness responsible for killing the dog was shot by a park employee. As a result of the escape, the park was required to upgrade facilities.

Primarily a shortstop, Smith played for five teams in 15 seasons. He made his major league debut for Altoona Mountain City of the Union Association in . After Altoona's team folded after just 25 games, he jumped to the Cleveland Blues of the National League. After the 1884 season, Cleveland then sold him, along with 6 other players, to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms for $4000. On June 17, , Smith reportedly committed seven errors intentionally, when his team decided to punish new pitcher Phenomenal Smith, losing the game 18-5. All 18 runs against the brash left-hander were unearned‚Äö due to a total of 14 Brooklyn \\"errors\\". \\"Phenomenal\\" gave himself his nickname before he joined the team‚Äö saying that he was so good that he did not need his teammates to win. The intentional misplays of his teammates caused club President Lynch to fine the guilty players $500 each‚Äö but he reluctantly agreed to release Smith to ensure team harmony. A reliable shortstop in the days when a fielding average below .900 could lead the league, he did lead the American Association in , with an .886 average. When the AA folded in , Smith and most of his teammates transferred to the National League's new Brooklyn franchise. In , John Montgomery Ward took over as manager and shortstop, effectively ending Smith's career with Brooklyn, so he left and joined the Cincinnati Reds. There he led NL shortstops in assists each year from 1891 to . Smith later returned in , when Cincinnati and Brooklyn swapped shortstops, with Tommy Corcoran moving to the Reds. His major league career came to end after the 1898 season, when he played just 51 games for the St. Louis Browns, and moved on to play for the Minneapolis Millers of the Northwestern League for the 1899 and 1900 seasons.

Haug church, which is the main church of Haug parish, Vang primary school, and Haugsbygd lower secondary school, are located here. Previously, there was both a bank and a post office there, but after the bank and postal services started their rationalizations, these were merged.Here is Haug Kirke (by Ardis Danger. Ringerike-Drammen District Lag. August, 2008 Currently Haugsbygd mainly consist of agricultural estates and modern residential areas of detached houses. In recent years the area has been one of the most desirable building areas of Ringerike municipality, which repeatedly has opened new developments in Haugsbygd. There are roads leading to Haug over county road 163 H√∏nefoss to Klekken, either over Fl√∏ytingen north of S√¶trang, or √òvre Klekkenvei south of Klekken Hotell. It is also possible to get to Haug over Riksvei 35 in direction of Jevnaker, over Viulveien from Hvalsmoen and Hvalsveien. One can also get there from Jevnaker or Norderhov over Riksvei over √Ösbygda and Klekken, over Harehaugveien from Smeden south of B√∏lgen.  Excavations  Gjermundbu helmet from mound burial (Museum of National Antiquities) The village must have been of significance in the past. The S√¶trang and Gjermundbu discoveries are proof of this. The S√¶trang discovery (S√¶trangfunnet) was a rich grave finds from a burial mound dating to ca. 975 AD. The tomb was a double grave that was discovered in 1834 on the S√¶trang farm Haugsbygd. The burial mound was about 20 meters in diameter and about 1.2 meters high. In the middle of the mound was found a double tomb. Contents included 63.89 grams of gold in the form of five gold rings and about 900 beads of amber, glass and glass mosaics, and a silver bead.S√¶trangfunnet (Store norske leksikon) The Gjermundbu mound burial (Gjermundbufunnene) was unearthed during 1943 and contained many artifacts, most of those being weaponry or horse harnesses. A Viking Era helmet with aventail and a single fragmented, but possibly complete mail shirt have been excavated at the Gjermundbu farm. This helmet was made of iron and was in the shape of a rounded or peaked cap made from four plates after the spangenhelm pattern. The helmet has a rounded cap and has a \\"spectacle\\" guard around the eyes and nose that formed a sort of mask. , it is the only known example of a complete Viking helmet in existence.Gjermundbu (The Unique Gjermundbu Find) See also Viking Age arms and armour References External links *University of Oslo.

Dull colored, the Mozambique tilapia often lives up to a decade in its native habitats. It is a popular fish for aquaculture. Due to human introductions, it is now found in many tropical and subtropical habitats around the globe, where it can become an invasive species because of its robust nature. These same features make it a good species for aquaculture because it readily adapts to new situations. It is known as black tilapia in Colombia and as blue kurper in South Africa.Big Bass Description The native Mozambique tilapia is laterally compressed, and has a deep body with long dorsal fins, the front part of which have spines. Native coloration is a dull greenish or yellowish, and weak banding may be seen. Adults reach up to in standard length and up to . Size and coloration may vary in captive and naturalized populations due to environmental and breeding pressures. It lives up to 11 years. Distribution and habitat An adult male in breeding condition The Mozambique tilapia is native to inland and coastal waters in southeastern Africa, from the Zambezi basin in Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe to Bushman River in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. It is threatened in its home range by the introduced Nile tilapia. In addition to competing for the same resources, the two readily hybridize.Waal 2002 This has already been documented from the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers, and it is expected that pure Mozambique tilapia eventually will disappear from both. Otherwise it is a remarkably robust and fecund fish, readily adapting to available food sources and breeding under suboptimal conditions. Although primarily a fish of fresh and brackish waters, it can live in salt water and even in hypersaline conditions where the salinity can be about three times as high as seawater. Among others, it occurs in rivers, streams, canals, ponds, lakes, swamps and estuaries, although it typically avoids fast-flowing waters, waters at high altitudes and the open sea. It inhabits waters that range from . =Invasiveness= The Mozambique tilapia or hybrids involving this species and other tilapia are invasive in many parts of the world outside their native range, having escaped from aquaculture or been deliberately introduced to control mosquitoes.Moyle 1976 The Mozambique tilapia has been nominated by the Invasive Species Specialist Group as one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world.Courtenay 1989 It can harm native fish populations through competition for food and nesting space, as well as by directly consuming small fish.Courtenay et al. 1974 In Hawaii, striped mullet Mugil cephalus are threatened because of the introduction of this species. The population of hybrid Mozambique tilapia x Wami tilapia in California's Salton Sea may also be responsible for the decline of the desert pupfish, Cyprinodon macularius.Courtenay and Robins 1989Swift et al. 1993 Hybridization As with most species of tilapia, Mozambique tilapia have a high potential for hybridization. They are often crossbred with other tilapia species in aquaculture because purebred Mozambique tilapia grow slowly and have a body shape poorly suited to cutting large fillets. However, Mozambique tilapia have the desirable trait of being especially tolerant of salty water. Also, hybrids between certain parent combinations (such as between Mozambique and Wami tilapia) result in offspring that are all or predominantly male. Male tilapia are preferred in aquaculture as they grow faster and have a more uniform adult size than females. The \\"Florida Red\\" tilapia is a popular commercial hybrid of Mozambique and blue tilapia. Behavior =Feeding= Mozambique tilapia are omnivorous. They can consume detritus, diatoms, invertebrates, small fry and vegetation ranging from macroalgae to rooted plants.Mook 1983Trewevas 1983 This broad diet helps the species thrive in diverse locations. Due to their robust nature, Mozambique tilapias often over-colonize the habitat around them, eventually becoming the most abundant species in a particular area. When over-crowding happens and resources get scarce, adults will sometimes cannibalize the young for more nutrients. Mozambique tilapia, like other fish such as Nile tilapia and trout, are opportunistic omnivores and will feed on algae, plant matter, organic particles, small invertebrates and other fish. Feeding patterns vary depending on which food source is the most abundant and the most accessible at the time. In captivity, Mozambique tilapias have been known to learn how to feed themselves using demand feeders. During commercial feeding, the fish may energetically jump out of the water for food. =Social structure= Mozambique tilapias often travel in groups where a strict dominance hierarchy is maintained. Positions within the hierarchy correlate with territoriality, courtship rate, nest size, aggression, and hormone production. In terms of social structure, Mozambique tilapias engage in a system known as lek-breeding, where males establish territories with dominance hierarchies while females travel between them. Social hierarchies typically develop because of competition for limited resources including food, territories, or mates. During the breeding season, males cluster around certain territory, forming a dense aggregation in shallow water. This aggregation forms the basis of the lek through which the females preferentially choose their mates. Reproductive success by males within the lek is highly correlated to social status and dominance. In experiments with captive tilapias, evidence demonstrates the formation of linear hierarchies where the alpha male participates in significantly more agonistic interactions. Thus, males that are higher ranked initiate much more aggressive acts than subordinate males. However, contrary to popular belief, Mozambique tilapias display more agonistic interactions towards fish that are farther apart in the hierarchy scale than they do towards individuals closer in rank. One hypothesis behind this action rests with the fact that aggressive actions are costly. In this context, members of this social system tend to avoid confrontations with neighboring ranks in order to conserve resources rather than engage in an unclear and risky fight. Instead, dominant individuals seek to bully subordinate tilapias both for an easy fight and to keep their rank. =Communication and aggression= Urine in Mozambique tilapias, like many freshwater fish species, acts as a vector for communication amongst individuals. Hormones and pheromones released with urine by the fish often affect the behavior and physiology of the opposite sex. Dominant males signal females through the use of a urinary odorant. Further studies have suggested that females respond to the ratio of chemicals within the urine, as opposed to the odor itself. Nevertheless, females are known to be able to distinguish between hierarchical rank and dominant vs. subordinate males through chemicals in urine. Urinary pheromones also play a part in male ‚Äì male interaction for Mozambique tilapias. Studies have shown that male aggression is highly correlated with increased urination. Symmetrical aggression between males resulted in an increase in the release of urination frequency. Dominant males both store and release more potent urine during agonistic interactions. Thus, both the initial stage of lek formation and the maintenance of social hierarchy may highly depend on the males‚Äô varying urinary output. Aggression amongst males usually involve a typical sequence of visual, acoustic, and tactile signals that eventually escalates to physical confrontation if no resolution is reached. Usually, conflict ends before physical aggression as fights are both costly and risky. Bodily damage may impede an individual's ability to find a mate in the future. In order to prevent cheating, in which individual may fake his own fitness, these aggressive rituals incur significant energetic costs. Thus, cheating is prevented by the sheer fact that the costs of initiating a ritual often outweigh the benefits of cheating. In this regard, differences between individuals in endurance plays a critical role in resolving the winner and the loser. =Reproduction= In the first step in the reproductive cycle for Mozambique tilapia, males excavate a nest into which a female can lay her eggs. After the eggs are laid, the male fertilizes them. Then the female stores the eggs in her mouth until the fry hatch; this act is called mouthbrooding.Popma, 1999 One of the main reasons behind the aggressive actions of Mozambique tilapias is access to reproductive mates. The designation of Mozambique tilapias as an invasive species rests on their life-history traits: Tilapias exhibit high levels of parental care as well as the capacity to spawn multiple broods through an extended reproductive season, both contributing to their success in varying environments. In the lek system, males congregate and display themselves to attract females for matings. Thus, mating success is highly skewed towards dominant males, who tend to be larger, more aggressive, and more effective at defending territories. Dominant males also build larger nests for the spawn. During courtship rituals, acoustic communication is widely used by the males to attract females. Studies have shown that females are attracted to dominant males who produce lower peak frequencies as well as higher pulse rates. At the end of mating, males guard the nest while females take both the eggs and the sperm into their mouth. Due to this, Mozambique tilapias can occupy many niches during spawning since the young can be transported in the mouth. These proficient reproductive strategies may be the cause behind their invasive tendencies. Male Mozambique tilapias synchronize breeding behavior in terms of courtship activity and territoriality in order to take advantage of female spawning synchrony. One of the costs associated with this synchronization is the increase in competition among males, which are already high on the dominance hierarchy. As a result, different mating tactics have evolved in these species. Males may mimic females and sneak reproduction attempts when the dominant male is occupied. Likewise, another strategy for males is to exist as a floater, travelling between territories in an attempt to find a mate. Nevertheless, it is the dominant males who have the greatest reproductive advantage. =Parental care= Typically, Mozambique tilapias, like all species belonging to the genus Oreochromis and species like Astatotilapia burtoni, are maternal mouthbrooders, meaning that spawn is incubated and raised in the mouth of the mother. Parental care is, therefore, almost exclusive to the female. Males do contribute by providing nests for the spawn before incubation, but the energy costs associated with nest production is low relative to mouthbrooding. Compared to nonmouthbrooders, both mouthbrooding and growing a new clutch of eggs is not energetically feasible. Thus, Mozambique tilapias arrest oocyte growth during mouthbrooding to conserve energy. Even with oocyte arrest, females that mouthbrood take significant costs in body weight, energy, and low fitness. Hence, parental- offspring conflict is visible through the costs and benefits to the parents and the young. A mother caring for her offspring carries the cost of reducing her own individual fitness. Unlike most fish, Mozambique tilapias exhibit an extended maternal care period believed to allow social bonds to be formed. Use in aquaculture An albino strain has been developed in captivity Mozambique tilapia are hardy individuals that are easy to raise and harvest, making them a good aquacultural species. They have a mild, white flesh that is appealing to consumers. This species constitutes about 4% of the total tilapia aquaculture production worldwide, but is more commonly hybridized with other tilapia species.Gupta and Acosta 2004 Tilapia are very susceptible to diseases such as whirling disease and ich. Mozambique tilapia are resistant to wide varieties of water quality issues and pollution levels. Because of these abilities they have been used as bioassay organisms to generate metal toxicity data for risk assessments of local freshwater species in South Africa rivers.

It is one of the two major parties in Alaska, alongside the Republicans. Currently, the party holds no statewide offices in Alaska. In the state legislature meanwhile, Democrats hold 7 of the 20 seats in the state senate and 15 of the 40 seats in the state house. It controls the state House by forming a coalition with Independents and some Republicans. Currently there are over 75,000 registered members of the Alaska Democratic Party. History In 1949, the Young Democrats of Alaska was established as a group. Except in U.S. presidential elections, the Alaska Democratic Party was very successful in the early days of statehood and the late territory days (pre-1959), featuring such characters as territorial governor and later national senator Ernest Gruening. Gruening was one of only two senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which authorized an expansion of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Bob Bartlett, also a Democrat, and erstwhile secretary of the territory, was the first senator from Alaska, and remained a senator until his death in 1968. William A. Egan, also of the Alaska Democratic Party, was elected the first governor of the State of Alaska. Until the election of governor Bill Walker, he was the only governor of Alaska of either party to have been born in Alaska. In the U.S. House meanwhile, Democrat Ralph J. Rivers was the state's first representative from statehood until 1967. In the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Ted Kennedy, representing Senator Robert Kennedy (of New York), in the presence of Senator Gruening, gave a historic speech on the island-community of Sitka, Alaska. Democrat Mike Gravel was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1968, and stayed in for two terms until his defeat in the Democratic primary in 1980 (Republicans ultimately picked up the seat in the general). In 2008 and 2019, he was a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. By the end of 1973, Gravel was the only Alaska Democrat remaining in federal office, as the state's House seat and other Senate seat had switched hands to Republicans. After Gravel left office, Democrats would not hold any seats in Alaska's congressional delegation again for almost three decades. =1972 U.S. House election= On October 16, 1972, Alaska's incumbent Democratic congressman Nick Begich went missing in a plane crash along with House Majority Leader Hale Boggs en route to Juneau from Anchorage. In spite of this, three weeks later, Begich won re-election to his seat. However, he was later declared dead on December 29 of that year after an intensive search effort. Begich's body nor the plane he flew on were ever found. Begich is currently the most recent Democrat to serve Alaska in the U.S. House. In a special election held shortly thereafter in 1973, Republican Don Young (who had previously lost to the late Begich) won election to the seat, and has held it ever since. =Recent history= Following the oil boom in Alaska, and the construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline, many Americans from outside the State came to Alaska to live. This correlated with and possibly caused (following a national trend ) a slow but distinct rightward shift in State politics. Particularly in the last two decades, however, it is not the Democratic party per se that has lost power, but the range of shifts in the due to \\"swing\\" votes. The most recent Democrat to serve as Governor of Alaska was Tony Knowles, from 1995 to 2003. In a further confusion of the recent degree of authority of the Democratic Party in the State of Alaska, a plethora of registered Democrats voted for (ideologically Republican) incumbent Senator Lisa Murkowski during her write in campaign of the 2010 election, presumably with the goal of defeating the Republican standard bearer and Tea Party candidate Joe Miller Democrat Barack Obama won the 2008 Democratic caucuses in Alaska by a margin of more than three to one over Hillary Clinton, a higher percentage than any State in the union except Idaho. He then received 37.89 percent of the total statewide vote in the general election, losing the state to Republican John McCain, who had selected then- Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential running mate. In the same election year however, Democrat Mark Begich won election to the U.S. Senate by a narrow margin over longtime Republican incumbent Ted Stevens. Begich later lost re-election in 2014, while the Democratic-endorsed independent candidate Bill Walker simultaneously defeated incumbent Republican Sean Parnell for Governor. In 2012, President Obama lost the state to Republican Mitt Romney yet increased his percentage of the statewide vote to 40.81%. This was later used as evidence in a high-profile New York Times article detailing the complexity of Alaska politics and the difficulty in predicting the influence and elect-ability of Democrats within the State. Most recently in 2016, Republican candidate for President Donald Trump carried the state by around fifteen percentage points over Hillary Clinton, slightly worse than Obama's 2012 performance. No Democrat has carried Alaska in presidential elections since 1964 when Lyndon B. Johnson had his landslide victory over Barry Goldwater. Since Byron Mallott resigned as Lieutenant Governor in 2018 after a scandal, Democrats have held no statewide office in Alaska. On the flip side, Democrats do currently control the Alaska House of Representatives in a coalition with independent Republicans, while Republicans hold a supermajority in the Alaska State Senate with one independent Democrat caucusing with them.

It is located north of Ludington, Michigan, and is best known for its 4 miles (6.4 km) of undeveloped Lake Michigan shoreline. Geology Nordhouse Dunes in Manistee National Forest The lake levels of the upper Great Lakes have fluctuated sharply over the past 4,000 years, with a temporary high-water mark, the Nipssing stage, achieved about 3,500 years before the present. During the Nipissing stage, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan were interconnected as they are today, but the two lakes brimmed over with fresh water 605 feet (184 m) above sea level. As the lakes fell back toward their current level of 580 feet (177 m) above sea level, large quantities of sand were exposed. Subsequent work by lake-effect winds shaped this exposed sand into sand dunes. The Lake Michigan sand-dune shoreline around Big Sable Point was reshaped into the Big Sable Dunes complex, a 6,270-acre (25.4 km¬≤) area of sandy hills, dunal moraines, shallow lakes, and associated plant and animal life. The dunes reach heights of 140 feet (42 m) above lake level. The Nordhouse Dunes form the northern half of the preserved section of the Big Sable Dunes complex. The southern 2,820 acres (11.4 km¬≤) are contained within Michigan's Ludington State Park. Biology The older Nordhouse Dunes, farther away from Lake Michigan, have had time for the process of plant succession to produce a forest ecosystem. The local climate supports beech, sugar maple, red oak, and white oak trees, mixed with a thin sprinkling of evergreens such as the red pine and Michigan's state tree, the white pine. Pitcher's Thistle (Cirsium pitcheri) on beach Active dune areas closer to the lake are dotted with early-succession plants and trees such as the juniper bush and the jack pine. Of special interest is one of the two largest known remaining populations of the Pitcher's thistle, a threatened species listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 3,100 Nordhouse thistle plants of this species were inventoried in a 1991 counting exercise. In animal life, the primary browser is the familiar whitetail deer, mixed with typical examples of Michigan small game such as the coyote, fox, porcupine, and raccoon. Nordhouse Dunes today Sunset at Nordhouse Dunes After northwestern Michigan was heavily logged in the 19th century and early 20th century, the U.S. Congress re-designated much of the cutover land as the Manistee National Forest in 1938. Congress listed the Nordhouse Dunes as a wilderness in 1987. Two parking lots are located at Lake Michigan Recreation Area on the wilderness's northern edge and Nurnberg Road at its southeastern corner.

It would be two years before Twardowski appeared in another movie and that was a small part in the romance Thin Ice starring Sonja Henie and Tyrone Power. Because of the time he spent directing and appearing in plays on stage, it would be another two years before he worked in another movie. In 1939, Twardowski's career picked up as he appeared in two Warner Bros. anti-Nazi movies. He played Max Helldorf in the spy thriller Confessions of a Nazi Spy. Next Twardowski appeared in another spy thriller Espionage Agent starring Joel McCrea which was released just three weeks after Germany invaded Poland.

Twardowski plays Albert Stalhelm, a Stormtrooper of the Waffen-SS, who becomes disillusioned with the brutality of the Nazi regime. His character accidentally betrays his anti-Nazi friends to his fellow SS members, who in turn murder him. With the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent increase in war movies, Twardowski received uncredited roles as Nazis. He portrayed storm troopers, U-Boat captains, and army officers. He appeared in seven films in 1942, including a large role as Captain Gemmler in the Nazi spy thriller Dawn Express. He next played an uncredited role as a sergeant in The Pied Piper starring Monty Woolley as an Englishman trying to get out of German- occupied France with a group of children. He also appeared in the comedy Joan of Ozark. Twardowski appeared as a German soldier in Desperate Journey with Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan. He received a bit part as a U-Boat captain in RKO's The Navy Comes Through starring Pat O'Brien. He had another bit part in the comedy Once Upon a Honeymoon starring Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers. In 1942, Twardowski, appeared in a small role in Casablanca playing a German officer. In 1943, Twardowski appeared in Lang's Hangmen Also Die!, portraying the notorious Nazi SS Commandant Reinhard Heydrich. All of his lines in this movie were in German. Twardowski played a German officer in Raoul Walsh's Background to Danger starring George Raft, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. This was followed by a bit part as a Nazi captain in the war drama First Comes Courage. Twardowski appeared in The Strange Death of Adolf Hitler. Later that year, he had a small part in the war drama The Cross of Lorraine starring Gene Kelly, Cedric Hardwicke and Lorre. Twardowski's last two movies were 1944 war dramas; first he appeared as a doctor in The Hitler Gang and later as a German Red Cross representative in Resisting Enemy Interrogation.  Stage career  Twardowski's acting career ended along with World War II. However, he continued to write and direct plays. He originally starred on stage as the Dauphin in Schiller's productions of Die Jungfrau von Orleans. In the 1930s, Twardowski directed and appeared in the stage productions of The Brothers Karamazov and Old Heidelberg in the Pasadena Playhouse. In 1939, he wrote and produced a play in Brooklyn's St. Felix Street Playhouse called Shakespeare Merchant - 1939, based on Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Twardowski also sang tenor in a number of musicals. After his retirement from movies, Twardowski worked again as a stage actor.

Some places where public computers may be available are libraries, schools, or facilities run by government. Public computers share similar hardware and software components to personal computers, however, the role and function of a public access computer is entirely different. A public access computer is used by many different untrusted individuals throughout the course of the day. The computer must be locked down and secure against both intentional and unintentional abuse. Users typically don't have authority to install software or change settings. A personal computer, in contrast, is typically used by a single responsible user, who can customize the machine's behavior to their preferences. Public access computers are often provided with tools such as a PC reservation system to regulate access. The world's first public access computer center was the Marin Computer Center in California, co-founded by David and Annie Fox in 1977. Kiosks See also: Computer Kiosk A kiosk is a special type of public computer using software and hardware modifications to provide services only about the place the kiosk is in. For example, a movie ticket kiosk can be found at a movie theater. These kiosks are usually in a secure browser with zero access to the desktop. Many of these kiosks may run Linux, however, ATMs, a kiosk designed for depositing money, often run Windows XP. Public computers in the United States =Library computers= In the United States and Canada, almost all public libraries have computers available for the use of patrons, though some libraries will keep users timed to allow others to get turns and keep the library less busy.

The U.S. government has given money to many school boards to purchase computers for educational applications. Schools may have multiple computer labs, which contain these computers for students to use. There is usually Internet access on these machines, but some schools will put up a blocking service to limit the websites that students are able to access to only include educational resources, such as Google. In addition to controlling the content students are viewing, putting up these blocks can also help to keep the computers safe by preventing students from downloading malware and other threats. However, the effectiveness of such content filtering systems is questionable since it can easily be circumvented by using proxy websites, Virtual Private Networks and for some weak security systems merely knowing the IP address of the intended website is enough to go through. School computers often have advanced operating system security to prevent tech-savvy students from inflicting damage (i.e. the Windows Registry Editor and Task Manager, etc.) are disabled on Microsoft Windows machines. Schools with very advanced tech services may also install a locked down BIOS/firmware or make kernel-level changes to the operating system, eradicating all chances of unauthorized activity.

It is responsible for promoting the ideologies and core values of the national Democratic Party in Arkansas. The current party Chair is Michael John Gray, a farmer and former state Representative from Augusta, Arkansas (Woodruff County). History =Early statehood= Arkansas began its statehood with a strong Democratic dominance in politics. Before Arkansas became a state on June 15, 1836, its politics was dominated by a small group commonly called \\"The Family\\" or \\"The Dynasty\\" until the American Civil War. The founder of this party was James Conway, who was inspired by the death of his older brother, Henry Conway. On October 27, 1827, Henry Conway was killed in a duel by Robert Crittenden, a former friend that soon became his political opposition. In an act to avenge his brother's death, he formed the first political party of Arkansas, \\"The Dynasty\\". Many of the members in this group were related by either blood or marriage, and thus it received the name \\"The Family\\". This group was closely allied with former President Andrew Jackson. One of the former major factions of the party is known as the Swamp Democrats, around during the New South period of Democratic dominance in the state, along with their rivals, the Hill Democrats. The area of strength for the Swamp Democrats was the flooded timber and marshy areas of eastern Arkansas and the Grand Prairie section of the state. This was the region of the slaveholding plantations, and swamp Democrats generally voted in the interests of Arkansas planters and merchants. =Reconstruction through the Gilded Age= Following the Civil War, Arkansas was under Republican governance for the first time during the Reconstruction era.. Republicans such as Governor Powell Clayton were appointed to state office, to the chagrin of Confederate veterans and sympathizers. The economic hardships of Reconstruction, and the political vengeance of Republicans during Radical Reconstruction, engendered strong support for the Democratic Party in Arkansas and across the South, known as the Solid South. Following the removal of the Radical Republicans in Arkansas in the late 1870s, the state entered an \\"unbroken tenure\\" of Democratic hegemony until 1966, when Republican Winthrop Rockefeller won the Governorship. After Reconstruction, Democrats in Arkansas were known as Redeemers. This coalition was the Southern version of the Bourbon Democrat, and both factions were comparatively conservative and classically liberal. Redeemer politicians in Arkansas were typically prominent, landowning, white men of the former planter class, who retained control of soft and hard power through Jim Crow laws, disenfranchisement, and racial violence. Examples of Redeemers in Arkansas include Governor Jeff Davis. =Progressive Era= President Bill Clinton (1993‚àí2001) The start of the 20th century marked a change in Arkansans and the nation at large. Though more restrained in Arkansas, social activism and political reform grew throughout the Roaring Twenties. Generally, the period was marked by more individual candidates than the \\"factions\\" that defined politics in other Southern states, or a \\"ruling class\\" like The Family of early Arkansas.. Arkansas Democrats reformed the state's highway system, public schools, and prisons. However, the simultaneous good government movement, calling for more open and honest politicians, caught many of Arkansas's early Progressive politicians before major reform could be enacted. Governor Tom Terral succeeded in constructing a new Arkansas State Hospital, but was primaried by John Ellis Martineau, who accused Terral of receiving kickbacks, after his first term. Governor Harvey Parnell managed to pass reform measures, but was blamed for the Great Depression, and left office extremely unpopular.. The Progressive Era in Arkansas was shorter-lived than across the United States. Though Arkansas and the nation voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt in great numbers in the 1932 presidential election, Junius Futrell won the gubernatorial election on a platform of retrenchment the same year. Within the state, the election represented a realignment in favor of the conservative wing of the party. Futrell was the most conservative governor elected in decades, with 1932 marking the end of the reform era in Arkansas.. =Democratic Control Weakens= Over the years, the Republican Party spread from its geographic base in the Ozarks,. largely through individual conversion.. Presidential elections became more competitive, though Arkansas was last to deny electoral votes to a Democrat by supporting George Wallace in the 1968 presidential election. Following that election, Arkansas only voted Democrat to support fellow Southerner Jimmy Carter,. and former Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, with US Senate and Representative races also becoming more competitive, and slowly flipping to Republican control.. During the 1970s and 1980s, Arkansans were very likely to split their ballots among parties, indicating a tradition of independence.. The most notable example was the northwest part of the state's support of George Wallace for President, Republican Winthrop Rockefeller for governor, and Democrat J. William Fulbright for Senate in 1968. The independence likely came from decades of identification as a Democrat meaning little, as elections were truly decided in Democratic primaries among the conservative and liberal factions.. This era was marked by Arkansas Democrats willing to vote for Republicans when the Democratic candidate was unpalatable, when an attractive Republican was running, such as Rockefeller or Ronald Reagan, or to \\"punish\\" Democratic incumbents. For example, Frank White unseated Bill Clinton in the 1980 gubernatorial election, but Clinton was returned to office handily in 1982. Democrats continued to dominate the state legislature with more than 3 to 1 majorities until 2010, despite a 1992 constitutional amendment that limited the terms of the Democratic incumbents. https://ballotpedia.org/Arkansas_Term_Limits,_Proposed_Amendment_4_(1992) =Republican Party Control= Although the Democratic Party of Arkansas was not as dominant as it once was, it still had a strong presence in the state. However, that began to change in the early 2010s. With the election of Barack Obama as President in 2009, Arkansas Democrats have seen their influence gradually decline. The Republicans began to make serious inroads in 2010, and this continued until 2014, when Republicans captured all the statewide offices, both chambers of the state legislature, all four U.S. House seats, and both U.S Senate seats, putting the Democrats in the minority for the first time in the state's history. Current elected officials =Members of Congress= U.S. Senate * None Both of Arkansas's U.S. Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 2014. Mark Pryor was the last Democrat to represent Arkansas in the U.S. Senate. First elected in 2002, Pryor lost his bid for a third term in 2014 to Tom Cotton who has held the seat since. U.S. House of Representatives * None All 4 of Arkansas's congressional districts have been held by Republicans since 2012. The last Democrat to represent Arkansas in the House of Representatives was Mike Ross. First elected in 2000, Ross opted not to run for re-election in 2012, instead unsuccessfully running for governor in 2014. State senator Gene Jeffress ran as the Democratic nominee and was subsequently defeated by Republican challenger Tom Cotton. =Statewide offices= * None Arkansas has not elected any Democratic candidates to statewide office since 2010, when Mike Beebe, Dustin McDaniel, and Martha Shoffner were re-elected as governor, attorney general, and treasurer and Charlie Daniels was elected as state auditor. In 2014, term limits prevented Beebe, and McDaniel from seeking third terms while Shoffner resigned during her second term and her replacement Charles Robinson was not eligible to run for a full term and Daniels opted not to seek re- election to a second term. Mike Ross, Nate Steel, Karen Sealy Garcia, and Regina Stewart Hampton ran as the Democratic nominees in the 2014 elections and were all subsequently defeated by Republican challengers Asa Hutchinson, Leslie Rutledge, Dennis Milligan, and Andrea Lea. =State legislative leaders= *Senate Minority Leader: Keith Ingram *House Minority Leader: David Whitaker  Past Governors  Democrat Governors that have won the Gubernatorial elections in the State of Arkansas since 1941: *Homer Martin Adkins (1941-1945) *Benjamin Travis Laney (1945-1949) *Sidney Sanders McMath (1949-1953) *Francis Cherry (1953-1955) *Orval Eugene Faubus (1955-1967) *Dale Bumpers (1971-1975) *David Pryor (1975-1979) *Joe Purcell (1979) *Bill Clinton (1979-1981, 1983-1992) *Jim Guy Tucker (1992-1996) *Mike Beebe (2007-2015) List of Governors of Arkansas Party platform The Democratic Party of Arkansas has a platform standing on the following principles: law and order with justice, every citizen, regardless of religion or race, is entitled to an equal voice in government. Also, it advocates equal opportunity, fairness and justice, and progressiveness. It not only promotes these standards but also takes action to achieve them. With these principles comes a list of 52 rules. The platform is filled with values such as ethics, education, economic development and opportunity, agriculture, transportation and infrastructure, environment and energy, health care, Social Security/Medicaid/Medicare, taxes, military/veterans and national security, criminal justice, civil rights and civil liberties, and public service. Its position on these topics closely mirrors that of the national Democratic Party.

This method was developed to maintain standardized testing methods ensuring that a subject's study outcomes (clinical or research) could be compiled, reproduced, and effectively analyzed and compared using the scientific method. The system is based on the relationship between the location of an electrode and the underlying area of the brain, specifically the cerebral cortex. During sleep and wake cycles, the brain produces different, objectively recognized and distinguishable electrical patterns, which can be detected by electrodes on the skin. (These patterns might vary, and can be affected by multiple extrinsic factors, i.e. age, prescription drugs, somatic diagnoses, hx of neurologic insults/injury/trauma, and substance abuse) The \\"10\\" and \\"20\\" refer to the fact that the actual distances between adjacent electrodes are either 10% or 20% of the total front‚Äìback or right‚Äìleft distance of the skull. For example, a measurement is taken across the top of the head, from the nasion to inion. Most other common measurements ('landmarking methods') start at one ear and end at the other, normally over the top of the head. Specific anatomical locations of the ear used include the tragus, the auricle and the mastoid.  Electrode labeling  Each electrode placement site has a letter to identify the lobe, or area of the brain it is reading from: pre-frontal (Fp), frontal (F), temporal (T), parietal (P), occipital (O), and central (C). Note that there is no \\"central lobe\\"; due to their placement, and depending on the individual, the \\"C\\" electrodes can exhibit/represent EEG activity more typical of frontal, temporal, and some parietal-occipital activity, and are always utilized in polysomnography sleep studies for the purpose of determining stages of sleep. There are also (Z) sites: A \\"Z\\" (zero) refers to an electrode placed on the midline sagittal plane of the skull, (FpZ, Fz, Cz, Oz) and is present mostly for reference/measurement points. These electrodes will not necessarily reflect or amplify lateral hemispheric cortical activity as they are placed over the corpus callosum, and do not represent either hemisphere adequately. \\"Z\\" electrodes are often utilized as 'grounds' or 'references,' especially in polysomnography sleep studies, and diagnostic/clinical EEG montages meant to represent/diagnose epileptiform seizure activity, or possible clinical brain death. Note that the required number of EEG electrodes, and their careful, measured placement, increases with each clinical requirement and modality. Even-numbered electrodes (2,4,6,8) refer to electrode placement on the right side of the head, whereas odd numbers (1,3,5,7) refer to those on the left; this applies to both EEG and EOG (electrooculogram measurements of eyes) electrodes, as well as ECG (electrocardiography measurements of the heart) electrode placement. Chin, or EMG (electromyogram) electrodes are more commonly just referred to with \\"right,\\" \\"left,\\" and \\"reference,\\" or \\"common,\\" as there are usually only three placed, and they can be differentially referenced from the EEG and EOG reference sites. The \\"A\\" (sometimes referred to as \\"M\\" for mastoid process) refers to the prominent bone process usually found just behind the outer ear (less prominent in children and some adults). In basic polysomnography, F3, F4, Fz, Cz, C3, C4, O1, O2, A1, A2 (M1, M2), are used. Cz and Fz are 'ground' or 'common' reference points for all EEG and EOG electrodes, and A1-A2 are used for contralateral referencing of all EEG electrodes. This EEG montage may be extended to utilize T3-T4, P3-P4, as well as others, if an extended or \\"seizure montage\\" is called for.  Measurement  Specific anatomical landmarks are used for the essential measuring and positioning of the EEG electrodes. These are found with a tape measure, and often marked with a grease pencil, or \\"China marker.\\" * Nasion to Inion: the nasion is the distinctly depressed area between the eyes, just above the bridge of the nose, and the inion, is the crest point of back of the skull, often indicated by a bump (the prominent occipital ridge, can usually be located with mild palpation). Marks for the Z electrodes are made between these points along the midline, at intervals of 10%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 20% and 10%. * Preauricular to preauricular (or tragus to tragus: the tragus refers to the small portion of cartilage projecting anteriorly to the pinna). The preauricural point is in front of each ear, and can be more easily located with mild palpation, and if necessary, requesting patient to open mouth slightly. The T3, C3, Cz, C4, and T4 electrodes are placed at marks made at intervals of 10%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 20% and 10%, respectively, measured across the top of the head. * Skull circumference is measured just above the ears (T3 and T4), just above the bridge of the nose (at Fpz), and just above the occipital point (at Oz). The Fp2, F8, T4, T6, and O2 electrodes are placed at intervals of 5%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, and 5%, respectively, measured above the right ear, from front (Fpz) to back (Oz). The same is done for the odd- numbered electrodes on the left side, to complete the full circumference. * Measurement methods for placement of the F3, F4, P3, and P4 points differ. If measured front-to-back (Fp1-F3-C3-P3-O1 and Fp2-F4-C4-P4-O2 montages), they can be 25% \\"up\\" from the front and back points (Fp1, Fp2, O1, and O2). If measured side-to-side (F7-F3-Fz-F4-F8 and T5-P3-Pz-P4-T6 montages), they can be 25% \\"up\\" from the side points (F7, F8, T5, and T6). If measured diagonally, from Nasion to Inion through the C3 and C4 points, they will be 20% in front of and behind the C3 and C4 points. Each of these measurement methods results in different nominal electrode placements. When placing the A (or M) electrodes, palpation is often necessary to determine the most pronounced point of the mastoid process behind either ear; failure to do so, and to place the reference electrodes too low (posterior to the ear pinna, proximal to the throat) may result in \\"EKG artifact\\" in the EEGs and EOGs, due to artifact from the carotid arteries. EKG artifact can be reduced with post-filtering of signals, or by \\"jumping\\" (co-referencing) of A/M reference electrodes, if replacement of reference electrodes is not possible, ameliorative, or if other clinical considerations prevent otherwise good placement (such as congenital malformation, or post-surgical considerations such as Cochlear Implants).  Higher-resolution systems  When recording a more detailed EEG with more electrodes, extra electrodes are added using the 10% division, which fills in intermediate sites halfway between those of the existing 10‚Äì20 system. This new electrode-naming-system is more complicated giving rise to the Modified Combinatorial Nomenclature (MCN). This MCN system uses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 for the left hemisphere which represents 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% of the inion-to- nasion distance respectively. The introduction of extra letter codes allows the naming of intermediate electrode sites. Note that these new letter codes do not necessarily refer to an area on the underlying cerebral cortex. The new letter codes of the MCN for intermediate electrode places are: *AF ‚Äì between Fp and F *FC ‚Äì between F and C *FT ‚Äì between F and T *CP ‚Äì between C and P *TP ‚Äì between T and P *PO ‚Äì between P and O Also, the MCN system renames four electrodes of the 10‚Äì20 system: *T3 is now T7 *T4 is now T8 *T5 is now P7 *T6 is now P8 A higher-resolution nomenclature has been suggested and called the \\"5% system\\" or the \\"10‚Äì5 system\\".

History President Jimmy Carter (1977‚àí1981) Originally having members who were conservative Southern Democrats, for over a century, the Democratic Party dominated Georgia state and local politics. From 1872 to 2002, the Democratic Party controlled the Governor's Mansion, both houses of the state legislature and most statewide offices. In 1976, Democratic Governor Jimmy Carter (1971-1975) was elected the 39th President of the United States. After switching to the Republican Party in 1998, Sonny Perdue went on to defeat Democrat Roy Barnes in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Perdue's unexpected victory marked the beginning of a decline for the Democratic Party of Georgia. Georgia House Speaker Tom Murphy, the longest serving Speaker in any state legislature, lost his bid for another term in the state House. Four Democrats in the Georgia State Senate changed their political affiliation, handing the upper house to the GOP. And in 2004, the Democratic Party lost control of the Georgia House of Representatives, putting the party in the minority for the first time in Georgia history. The Democratic Party of Georgia entered the 2010 elections with hopes that former Governor Roy Barnes could win back the Governor's Mansion.

The Indiana Democratic Party currently holds two of Indiana's nine Congressional seats. The party Chairman is John Zody. History and important figures =Statehood era= The Indiana Democratic Party has its roots in the work of Jonathan Jennings, Democratic-Republican and first governor of the newly formed state of Indiana in 1816. Jennings pushed hard for statehood, and is attributed as an intellectual father of the Indiana Democratic Party. He pushed for a statewide school system and a stable state bank.http://www.indems.org/index.php/pages/history/ Jonathan Jennings =Civil War era= Indiana political parties in the 19th century were extremely divided culturally. Indiana, more than any other Midwestern state, received an influx of southern farmers who didn't mix well with northern manufacturers and businessmen. Patronage was given out regularly as Democratic and Whig (and eventually Republican) politicians fought for control of state government.http://library.cqpress.com/cqweekly/document.php?id=wr100404320&type;=hitlist#=55& Whigs predominantly controlled the state legislature, while Democrats predominantly controlled the governorship. Turbulent elections and heated Democratic passion ended up persuading 50 Whig legislators to switch parties by 1852. Even though William Henry Harrison, a Whig and one of the first governors of the Indiana territory, ran for president in 1840, Democrats like Joseph Chapman were very critical of him and his supporters. The first Indiana Democratic Party meeting was held in 1848, and at the time was called the \\"Indiana State Central Committee of the Democratic Party\\". Only seven men were in attendance. Thomas Hendricks, nephew of the third governor of Indiana, became the first post-war Democrat to be elected governor in a Northern state. His popular bipartisan leadership would eventually lead him to be President Grover Cleveland's first vice president from 1885 to 1889. =20th century= As the city of Indianapolis grew into a massive urban area, Democrats began to continuously represent the city in the state legislature. Thomas Taggart, the mayor of Indianapolis from 1895‚Äì1901, became the first Hoosier to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In 1913, Thomas Marshall, Governor of Indiana, became yet another Democratic Hoosier to be a vice president (under Woodrow Wilson). Marshall is perhaps best known for his humorous quote as vice president, said on the Senate floor: \\"What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar.\\" Thomas Riley Marshall headshot Years later, World War II veteran Frank McKinney became a delegate in the 1948 Democratic Convention, and later became the second Hoosier to be Chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1951. In the 1980s, Evan Bayh became a popular figure within the Indiana Democratic Party as well as the state of Indiana. A young governor elected in 1988, Bayh was later elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998. Bayh's two terms as governor, along with his lieutenant governor Frank O'Bannon's own gubernatorial years, resulted in a budget surplus, tax cuts and increased funding for education and health insurance for the poor. Long considered a moderate, Bayh was rumored to be a top pick for Barack Obama's vice presidential nominee in 2008, but the spot ended up going to Delaware Senator Joe Biden. =21st Century= Following O'Bannon's death in 2003, Lieutenant Governor Joe Kernan succeeded him in office. Kernan lost the 2004 gubernatorial election to Republican Mitch Daniels, ending sixteen years of Democratic control of the Governor's Mansion. Democrats lost attempts to regain the office in 2008, 2012 (when former Speaker of the State House of Representatives John Gregg narrowly lost to U.S. Representative and future Vice President Mike Pence), and 2016 (when Gregg was again defeated, despite leading in the polls heading into election day).https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/governor/in/indiana_governor_holcomb_vs_gregg-6097.html Bayh, who had represented Indiana in the U.S. Senate since 1999, was reelected overwhelmingly in 2004 even as Republican George W. Bush carried the state in the presidential race. Bayh declined run again in 2010, resulting in Republicans gaining the seat, and was defeated in his bid for a non- consecutive third term in 2016. Republican control of both U.S. Senate seats from Indiana was ended when Joe Donnelly won the 2012 election, defeating controversial Republican candidate Richard Mourdock. Donnelly sought reelection in 2018, campaigning on his willingness to compromise with President Donald Trump, but was defeated by Mike Braun. The latest Democrat, to have garnered national recognition, was Pete Buttigieg, for his presidential bid in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He received 21 pledged delegates, the first openly gay candidate to ever win so many. https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2020/02/05/pete- buttigieg-first-openly-gay-candidate-earn-presidential-primary-delegates- nomination/4667796002/ He suspended his campaign on March 1, 2020, after a poor showing in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic presidential primary. Democratic candidate J. D. Ford became the first openly gay Hoosier elected to the Indiana Senate following his 2018 victory over Mike Delph, to whom he had narrowly lost a State Senate bid four years earlier.https://fox59.com/2018/11/06/democrat-j-d-ford-becomes-first-lgbt- candidate-elected-to-indiana-general-assembly/ 2011 walk-out In February 2011, 37 out of 40 House Democrats refused to show up to a legislative session in protest of a Republican \\"right-to-work\\" bill, which would allow workers represented by labor unions to refuse to pay \\"agency fees\\" to pay for the benefits and protections provided by the union.http://www.ibj.com/democratic- lawmakers-leave-indiana-block-labor-bill/PARAMS/article/25475 With the Republicans in the majority, Democrats feared that what they consider to be a radical bill would be easily passed, and many of them relocated across the border in Urbana, Illinois. The move largely took a cue from Indiana's counterparts in Wisconsin, where Democratic lawmakers there hid out in Illinois in protest of a controversial public-sector union bill in the same month. The Indiana Democratic caucus released a statement on the matter, saying that \\"By staying here, we will be giving the people of Indiana a chance to find out more about this radical agenda and speak out against it.\\" Republican Governor Mitch Daniels, who had previously urged Republican lawmakers not to pursue a right-to-work bill during that legislative session, stated his hope that Democrats would return to do their jobs. Daniels supported the bill, but not the political timing of it, as it would distract from other parts of his legislative agenda he wanted to focus on. In early March 2011, Democrats faced a choice of either returning to the state, or paying a daily fine of $250. The Indiana Constitution allows such fines as a way of compelling missing lawmakers to return. Such a tactic was employed as an alternative to sending state troopers after runaway legislators, which Governor Daniels declined to do. Lawmakers returned in six weeks, after they had been reassured that the right-to-work bill would not be on the legislative docket for that session. The bill was passed and signed into law the following year. Modern party structure and rules The Democratic Party of Indiana is administered by several executive positions at the head of the state party committee. John Zody is the Committee Chair, Cordelia Lewis-Burks the Vice Chair, Vera Mileusnic the Secretary and Sherrianne Standley the treasurer. There are 26 official rules for the Indiana Democratic Party, as of the current party rule charter, written in 2011. Under Rule 1, party structure is defined as consisting of multiple layers of committees, including (in order from less to more localized) a state central committee, congressional district committees, county committees and precinct committees. Towns, cities, townships and wards may create their own committees as needed. The charter ensures gender equality, open access to party meetings by party members, and lays out eligibility requirements for membership in the state Democratic Party. The state central committee has ultimate authority over all of the rules as well as local committees. Three party members are elected as National Committeepersons for four-year terms to serve on the Democratic National Committee, along with the state chair and vice chair. The state chair calls for a state party convention biennially, where rules of the party are drafted and amended. Delegates are selected through a process to attend the convention.

South Dakota Senator George McGovern used his win that year to propel him to claim the party's nomination over Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. The Iowa Caucuses would also help Jimmy Carter claim the Democratic nomination in 1976. From 1984 to 1996 the winner of the Iowa Caucus, excluding incumbents, did not go on to win their party's nomination.

Platform stances =Civil rights= The Iowa Democratic Party supports: # Marriage Equality or Gay Marriage; # Habeas Corpus; # Affirmative Action; and # Title IX. =Taxation= The IDP supports: # Revoking tax breaks for and imposing heavy tax penalties on corporations sending jobs out of the country; # Legalizing, taxing, regulating marijuana; # Expanding \\"Earned Income Tax Credits\\" eligibility. =Social Security= The IDP supports: # Removing cap on Social Security contributions; # Honoring federal budget obligations to \\"Social Security Trust Fund\\"; # Social Security benefits for married same-sex couples. =Gun regulation= The IDP supports: # Fair, responsible, reasonable gun ownership; # Banning private ownership of assault-style weapons. =Agriculture and the environment= The IDP supports: # Energy independence with locally owned renewable, eco-sustainable sources. # Carbon/mercury sequestration; safe storage/disposal of coal ash and hazardous nuclear waste. # Cap and trade on carbon dioxide emissions; fines on excess. # National smart-grid with standardized interconnect agreement. # Net- metering, front-end loaded and declining for consumer investment of renewable energy production. # Improved \\"Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency\\" standards for all vehicles. # Green public transportation. # Passage of \\"Land and Water Legacy Constitutional Amendment\\". # Industrial hemp production =Legislative positions= Iowa Democrats support President Obama's job plans and are urging their Republican colleagues to back the proposal.http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20111003/NEWS/111003023/Iowa- Democrats-support-presidential-jobs-act-passage-Branstad-s-education-plans Chair of the Education committee State Senator Herman Quirmback (D-Ames) spoke favorably about Iowa Democrats supporting Governor Terry Branstad's education proposals. Legislative accomplishments =Civil rights= Governor Tom Vilsack issued a governor's order in 2005 that restored voting rights to felons who completed serving their sentences. The order's anticipated result would be returning the right to vote to over 80,000 Iowans. In 2011, Governor Terry Branstand rescinded this order.http://publications.iowa.gov/10194/1/Exec_Order_70.pdf =Agriculture= Governor Tom Vilsack also signed a governor's order in 2000 that created the Iowa Food Policy Council.http://www.food-matters.org/pages/iowa.htm =Social issues= In 2007, Governor Chet Culver signed legislation easing limitations on stem-cell research.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5252449 =Jobs program= Later in 2009 and 2010, Governor Culver signed into law $875 million to go towards the I-Jobs program. Analysis from both Minnesota State Colleges and Universities and Southern Illinois University estimate that through 2011 the I-Jobs program will create 32,000‚Äì36,000 jobs. =Renewable energy= Governor Chet Culver signed legislation in 2007 that created the Iowa Power Fund. The fund spent a total of $70 million on 49 projects related to renewable energy. The largest project dealt with experimenting with cellulosic ethanol at an ethanol plant in Emmetsburg, Iowa. In June 2011, the project was ended by Governor Terry Branstad.http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/business/local/article_2906ee96-e459-50f2-80fe-f69fb8ec91ae.html =Military and veterans= Governor Chet Culver's first Executive Order in 2007 orders that the United States flag be flown at half staff to honor members of the Iowa National Guard, Iowa Air National Guard, or resident of Iowa who was serving as a member of the U.S. military and was killed in the line of duty.http://publications.iowa.gov/4600/1/01-070127.pdf In 2010, Governor Chet Culver signed House File 2532 which allows benefits paid for by the Veterans Trust Fund to be exempted from individual income taxes.http://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and- politics/article_2ce4c702-41cb-11df-87cf-001cc4c002e0.html Current political strength =Presidential level= From 1988 to 2012, Democrats at the presidential level had consistent success in Iowa. With the exception of the 2004 presidential election, when George W. Bush carried the state's electoral votes, Iowa's electoral votes went to the Democratic candidate in every election during that twenty-four year period. This reversed the trend of the prior twenty years, when Republicans had consistent success in Iowa's presidential elections. However, in the 2016 election, Donald Trump carried the state with 51.15% to Hillary Clinton's 41.74%. =Congressional level= Senator Tom Harkin was Iowa's junior U.S. Senator from January 3, 1985 to January 3, 2015, serving alongside Republican Chuck Grassley. Harkin previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 1985. In the 2006 U.S. House elections, Democrats captured Iowa's 1st congressional district and Iowa's 2nd congressional district from the Republican Party, which had controlled both districts for over three decades. When Senator Harkin announced his retirement, U.S. Representative Bruce Braley, from Iowa's 1st congressional district, announced he would run for the seat. In the 2014 U.S. House elections, Republicans re-captured Iowa's 1st congressional district, but Democrats retained David Loebsack in Iowa's 2nd congressional district. In the 2014 U.S. Senate elections, State Senator Joni Ernst beat U.S. Representative Bruce Braley. In the 2018 U.S. House elections the Democrats managed to retake Iowa's 1st congressional district with Abby Finkenauer and Iowa's 3rd congressional district with Cindy Axne, with the two of them being the first female U.S. Representatives from Iowa. =State level= Iowa Democrats held the Governor's office from 1999 to 2011. In 1999, Democrat Tom Vilsack was elected governor and served two terms. Following Vilsack's decision to not run for reelection then-Secretary of State Chet Culver ran in 2006 and won. However, in 2010, Republican Terry Branstad defeated Culver 52.9% to 43.3%. =Registered voters= As of July 2010 about 700,000 Iowans are registered Democrats compared to around 645,000 Republicans. Voters claiming independent outnumber both parties at just under 750,000 voters.http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2010/07/06/democratic- voters-still-outnumber-republicans-in-iowa/ History and past political strength The Democratic Party existed in what is present day Iowa when it was still part of the Wisconsin Territory in 1836. During the first election held in the territory Democrat Col G.W. Jones won 66% of the vote and the Whig candidate won just 57 votes in the county that today is the State of Iowa.Iowa Journal of History, Volume 6 pg. 7 Iowa entered the union in 1846 and its first governor was Ansel Briggs. That same year Iowa would send its first two Representatives to Congress, both Democrats.Iowa Journal of History, Volume 6 pg.51 Two years later the Iowa Legislature would send two Democrats to represent Iowa in the United States Senate. However, with the rise of the Republican Party of Iowa, Iowa Democrats had very little political power for nearly a century. With the exception of the late 1890s and 1930s, during the Great Depression, Iowa Democrats did not became a major political force until the 1950s with the coordination of unions in Iowa's largest cities. Demographic changes in the 1940s and 1950s helped lay a foundation for Democratic success. During World War II thousands of Iowans flocked to large cities to take advantage of war time jobs. By 1960 more Iowans resided in urban areas than rural areas. Iowa's industrial areas were not concentrated in one town, but spread out over the state's 15 largest cities. Along with industry developing across the state this led to Democratic strongholds spreading across Iowa as well. This demographic change translated into Democratic success first in Iowa's largest city Des Moines. There Democrats identified and registered thousands of new supporters. In 1954 Democrats \\"won control of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, every county administrative seat, and [...] all of Polk County's state legislative seats.A Party Reborn pg. 45 Taking advantage of internal Republican strife and backing from organized labor Democrat Herschel Loveless won an upset victory against incumbent Republican Governor Leo Hoegh in the 1956 election. Two years later Loveless would win reelection and Democrats would capture 50 State House members, 12 State Senators, and 4 Congressional Seats.A Party Reborn pg. 63 In 1960 Iowa's Government would revert to Republican control. However, during the 1960s and 1970s Iowa Democrats used their success in Polk County as model that was repeated across Iowa in organizing Democratic supporters. While Democrats would suffer large defeats in 1966 and 1968 Governor Hughes would go on to win three terms in office. Democrats were able to rebound electorally in the 1970s in part to John C. Culver and Richard C. Clark. They accomplished this by using computer models in a precinct by precinct basis to run issue driven campaigns.A Party Reborn pg.74 Both would be elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 and 1974, respectively. Republicans would once again regain party dominance in the late 1970s, but Democrats remained a competitive party in Iowa. Guy Mark Gillette John Culver =Presidential level= Democratic presidential candidates were historically unsuccessful in capturing the state's electoral votes. In fact the Republican Party's presidential nominee captured Iowa's electoral votes from 1856 to 1908. Democrat Woodrow Wilson won Iowa in the 1912 presidential election. Twenty years passed before another Democrat, Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the state. With the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide election win in the 1964 presidential election the Democratic nominee for president did not win Iowa's electoral votes from 1952 to 1984. Since the 1988 presidential election Democrats have had success in capturing Iowa's electoral votes. =Congressional level= Iowa Democrats were largely locked out of power at the national level until the 1930s. No Iowa Democrat served more than one term in the U.S. Senate until Guy Mark Gillette was elected in 1936. With Guy Gillette's defeat in 1944 Iowa Democrats wouldn't control a U.S. Senate seat until the election of Harold Hughes in 1969. From 1985 to 2015, Democrat Tom Harkin and Republican Chuck Grassley each held a U.S. Senate seat. Harold E. Hughes =State level= In 1957 Herschel C. Loveless would break nearly two decades of Republican control by being elected governor. Two years later he was reelected to a second term. In 1963 Harold Hughes was elected Governor of Iowa and would serve from 1963 to 1969. On January 1, 1969 Hughes resigned to take the U.S. Senate seat he had just won making his lieutenant governor, Robert D. Fulton, governor. Fulton was the last Democratic governor of Iowa until Tom Vilsack was elected in 1999.

Fanning participated in approximately 36 minor engagements and skirmishes, and in 1781, captured the Governor of North Carolina, Thomas Burke, from the temporary capital at Hillsborough. Additionally, Fanning was captured by Patriot forces 14 times throughout the war, each time escaping or receiving a pardon. After the British defeat in the war, Fanning fled to Canada, where he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1791 to 1801 representing Kings County. After being convicted of rape in 1801, Fanning was expelled from New Brunswick, and settled in Nova Scotia, where he lived the remainder of his life. Early life Fanning was born October 25, 1755 in Amelia County, Virginia. His father was David Fanning, and he grew up in Johnston County, North Carolina. He developed a childhood scalp condition which, according to oral traditions collected by early North Carolina historian Eli Caruthers, resulted in long-term baldness. Fanning and his sister were orphaned in 1764 by the death of their father, and in 1773, David settled on a tributary of the Reedy River in South Carolina. At the onset of the American Revolutionary War, Fanning was also an officer in a local militia unit in the South Carolina upcountry. In 1775, that region leaned in favor of the Loyalists, and Fanning lent himself to that cause. American War of Independence Fanning initially participated in the Snow Campaign of 1775, which proved to be a setback for the Loyalists in South Carolina. After a particular disaster at the Battle of Great Cane Brake on December 22, 1775, Fanning avoided capture by Patriot forces by taking refuge among the Cherokee nearby. Fanning was arrested by the Patriots one month later, which would prove to be the first of fourteen times he would be made a captive during the ensuing war. He managed to escape and flee again to the Cherokee, and was arrested three more times in North Carolina, each time being rescued by sympathetic forces. Fanning then returned home, and was subsequently arrested several more times before being acquitted at a treason trial in November 1777. At some point during this time, Fanning was harassed by Patriot sympathizers, and had trade goods stolen from him by them. In March 1778, Loyalist activity again swelled in South Carolina, and Fanning raised a company of Loyalist militia which raided Patriot sympathizers on the Georgia border. After being wounded and nearly captured, Fanning accepted a pardon from South Carolina Governor John Rutledge in August 1779. After accepting the pardon, Fanning agreed to serve in the Patriot militia, but after the British success in the Siege of Charleston, Fanning took up the Loyalist banner once again and began recruiting men to his cause. After the Battle of Kings Mountain in October 1780, Fanning traveled to Chatham County, North Carolina, where he intended to recruit loyalist soldiers in anticipation of the British entry into that state. In February 1781, General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis occupied Hillsborough, and Fanning was let loose against Patriot targets in the region, sparring with local Patriot militia, but not taking part in any substantial engagements. After suffering a Pyrrhic victory at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in March 1781, Cornwallis and the British Army were forced to march to Wilmington, leaving Fanning to recruit more Loyalist militia and stir up trouble in the North Carolina backcountry. Fanning asked for, and received a commission as a colonel of the Loyalist Militia in Randolph and Chatham counties on July 5, 1781. Fanning would often conduct raids with fewer than 12 men, and would capture and ransom or parole leading Patriot sympathizers and political figures. It has been estimated that he fought approximately 36 skirmishes during that year. Among these included a raid on a session of court in Chatham Courthouse, during which engagement Fanning took 53 prisoners, among them court officials, militia officers (including Colonel Ambrose Ramsey, and several members of the North Carolina General Assembly. Fanning was also the principal commander of the Loyalist militia involved in the battle at the House in the Horseshoe in the late summer of 1781, in which engagement Fanning forced the surrender of a force of Patriot militia. By the end of the summer of 1781, Fanning's infamy had attracted a force of approximately 950 Loyalist men to his command. On September 12, 1781, Fanning commenced a daring morning raid on Hillsborough, North Carolina, where the Patriot government of that state was based at the time. Fanning was able to capture North Carolina Governor Thomas Burke, along with 200 other Patriot prisoners, and escaped on the way to Wilmington. Brigadier General John Butler, the commanding officer of the Hillsborough District Brigade of militia, was alerted of Burke's capture, and attempted to stop Fanning from continuing on to British-controlled Wilmington at the Battle of Lindley's Mill on September 13. In that engagement, Fanning's militia, along with a unit of Highlanders commanded by Hector McNeill and Archibald McDugald, attempted to cross the Cane Creek, a tributary of the Haw River, and were surprised by Butler's men. Although Fanning had superior numbers with him, the battle lasted nearly four hours before Butler was dislodged from his position. Fanning was able to continue on to Wilmington, although suffering a grievous wound at Lindley's Mill, and delivered Burke to the British Army. In January 1782, the larger course of the war had turned against the British, and Fanning found himself forced to request terms of surrender from his adversary, General Butler. In April 1782, he married Sarah Carr, and the two escaped to South Carolina. A legislative act in North Carolina in 1783 which granted pardons to former Loyalists specifically exempted Fanning from its terms, along with only two other men. Post-war political career and death After the recognition of American independence, Fanning moved to Florida and then the Bahamas before settling in the newly created British colony of New Brunswick. Fanning was elected to the 2nd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly in 1791, although he was disliked by many of the more privileged former Loyalists of New Brunswick. Fanning represented Kings County, New Brunswick until 1801. In 1800, he was accused of the rape of 15-year-old Sarah London, and was found guilty and sentenced to death despite his protests that the evidence against him was flawed. Fanning was pardoned but exiled from New Brunswick, and expelled from the provincial assembly. Fanning settled in Digby, Nova Scotia where he owned several merchant ships, and later died in 1825. He left behind a daughter and two sons. Controversy In 1790, Fanning wrote The Narrative of Colonel David Fanning, which would first see print in 1861 in Richmond, Virginia, then the capital of the Confederate States of America. North Carolina historian Samuel A'Court Ashe wrote that Fanning was \\"one of the most extraordinary men evolved by the Revolutionary War\\", but Fanning's calculated and sometimes brutal methods during that conflict have left him with a controversial legacy.

As player, he made more than 150 appearances in the Football League representing Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace and A.F.C. Bournemouth, and played in the North American Soccer League for the Memphis Rogues. As manager, he took charge of Brentford for three seasons. Career Holder was born in Kilburn, London. He began his football career as an apprentice with Tottenham Hotspur in 1969 and remained with the club for five years. He played only 13 times in the Football League, but played six games in European competition, including a substitute appearance in the second leg of the 1974 UEFA Cup Final. He joined Crystal Palace in February 1975, and played 112 games in all competitions for the club, before spending a summer in the North American Soccer League with the Memphis Rogues. He returned to England and signed for Bournemouth of the Fourth Division in March 1979, before his playing career ended due to a pelvic injury. Holder then took up coaching, with clubs including Crystal Palace. He was appointed assistant to Brentford manager Steve Perryman in the late 1980s, and when Perryman resigned, Holder was confirmed as his successor in September 1990 after a spell in temporary charge. He guided them to the Third Division play-offs that season, only for the team to lose to Tranmere Rovers in the semi-final over two legs. In first leg at Griffin Park, a last minute equaliser from Kevin Godfrey gave Brentford hope, but later the same week, a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Prenton Park gave Tranmere the overall tie 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. As a coach Holder will be best remembered for his success during the 1991‚Äì92 season. He guided a Brentford side spearheaded by prolific striker Dean Holdsworth to the Third Division title and gained them a place in the new Division One. With six matches of the season left, Holder told the players that they needed to win them all: they did so. On Boxing Day 1992, Brentford went 10th in Division One and were just three points short of the playoff zone. Holder was voted Manager of the Month for the division, and there was much speculation as to whether Brentford could mount a challenge for promotion to the Premiership. But a sharp decline set in and defeat in the final game of the season condemned \\"The Bees\\" to relegation to Division Two. Holder was sacked three days later. In July 1993 he briefly joined Watford as Perryman's assistant, then assisted Peter Taylor at Southend United, and coached at Reading, before linking up with Perryman yet again in 1999, this time in Japan as assistant manager of J.League side Shimizu S-Pulse.

Dominated by the conservative planter elite through much of the 19th century, the party was historically prominent in politics since before the American Civil War. After struggling to regain power through Reconstruction, when the Republican Party became competitive due to support by most African Americans and many other Unionists, the party used violence and fraud to regain control of the state. Since the official end of reconstruction in 1877, the Democratic Party won 31 of 35 elections for governor. From the turn of the 19th century through much of the 1960s, they dominated state politics due to having disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through discriminatory requirements and practices related to voter registration and voting, resulting in the decline of the Republican and Populist parties in the state. The Democrats won the governorship in every election from 1877 until 1980, when Republican David Treen was elected in a sign of the realignment of political affiliation among white conservatives in the state. With the state dominated by a conservative white majority that has shifted to the Republican Party since the late 20th century, by 2011 the Democratic Party held no statewide elected seats after the Attorney General switched to the Republican Party in February of that year. Following the fall elections, the Democrats held 50 seats in the 105-seat State House, and in 2012 held one of six Congressional seats. Governor John Bel Edwards is a Democrat, and the only Democrat elected statewide in Louisiana. Current elected officials =Members of Congress= U.S. Senate *None Both of Louisiana's U.S. Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 2014. Mary Landrieu was the last Democrat to represent Louisiana in the U.S. Senate. First elected in 1996, Landrieu lost her bid for a fourth term in 2014 to Bill Cassidy who had held the seat since. U.S. House of Representatives Out of the 6 seats Louisiana is apportioned in the U.S. House of Representatives, 1 is held by a Democrat: * LA-03: Cedric Richmond Statewide offices Democrats control one of the seven elected statewide offices: *Governor: John Bel Edwards =State legislative leaders= * Senate Minority Leader: Troy Carter * House Minority Leader: Robert Johnson Party structure The party and its members are governed by a set of by-laws, which explain how the party is to operate and the responsibilities officials of the party have. The party further operates under a party constitution adopted in 1998 consisting of 11 articles. The articles cover the topics of: subordination, name, purpose, party membership, management, election, composition and appointment of the Democratic State Central Committee, organization of committee, officers, by-laws and amendments. Party leadership is broken up into three section: the Executive Committee, the Louisiana Democratic Central Committee and Parish Executive Committees. The Executive Committee consists of a chairman, four vice- chairman, two DNC committee persons, one DNC at-large, a vice chair of elected officials, a secretary, treasurer, clerk, legal counsel, and a parliamentarian. Each congressional district also receives two seats on the executive committee. The Louisiana Democratic Central Committee consists of a female and male committee member from each of the 105 State House Districts. Parish Executive Committees are set up in a similar fashion as the Party Executive Committee. Members serving in these positions generally serve a term of four years and are elected at the same time of the presidential elections. The party also has staff positions occupied by Stephen Handwerk as Executive Director, Michelle Brister as Deputy Executive Director, and D'seante Parks as Communications Director. Party history =Early history= The Democratic Party developed in Louisiana by the middle 1830s. The party was the product of the Jacksonians, \\"who had come to be called simply Democrats.\\" The early support for the Democratic Party came from cotton planters, who supported its anti-tariff stance, and people of ethnic French and Spanish ancestry, who were descended largely from colonists. Anglo-Americans who had settled the state from other parts of the South sometimes supported the Whigs. By the 1840s New Orleans had a large increase in population due to an influx of thousands of Irish and German immigrants; most of them became Democrats, as the party worked to integrate them into American life. As the Civil War approached, the main opposition party to the Democrats, the Whigs, collapsed. The dispute over the issue of slavery divided the Whigs into two main camps, those who opposed the expansion of slavery and those who agreed with the Democrats' stance \\"that the expansion of slavery was essential to its survival.\\" As a result, the Democratic Party dominated antebellum Louisiana. The new opposition party, the Know-Nothings, who were nativists, held power only in New Orleans for a brief period of time. =Governors of Louisiana= Alexandre Mouton, first Democratic Governor of Louisiana The Democratic Party won its first governorship in 1843 with the election of Alexandre Mouton. It would continue to win elections throughout the rest of the antebellum period. At the onset of the Civil War, the Democratic party won both elections held for the governorship in the portions of Louisiana that were held by the Confederate States of America. During Reconstruction, the Republican Party rose to power in the state with the enfranchisement of freedmen under constitutional amendments; they affiliated with the party that had gained their freedom and the end to slavery. Democratic insurgents were active in the state, and elections were accompanied by fraud and violence as they sought to suppress the black Republican vote. Following the disputed election of 1872, in which both parties' candidates declared victory, armed Democrats took over state offices in New Orleans for several days, struggling to unseat Republicans. The Colfax Massacre of blacks in Grant Parish was also related to this dispute. In 1874 the Democratic paramilitary group known as the White League established chapters in numerous parishes, and it worked to disrupt Republican meetings and voting. Due to a national compromise, in 1877 the federal government withdrew its troops from the South. The Democratic Party quickly regained control of the state legislature and politics; its candidates won every election for governor until 1980. This was due to violence, fraud and disenfranchisement of black Republicans. The exclusion of most blacks from the political system lasted through the 1960s. Since 1980 the governorship has been split between four Democrats and four Republicans. =Rise of the Solid South= Throughout the 1880s, the Democratic-dominated legislature in Louisiana passed Jim Crow laws and institutionalized racial segregation, as did the legislatures of other southern states. For a brief period, a Republican-Populist alliance gained power in the state house. Seeking to secure its power and to prevent such a challenge again, the white Democratic elite of this time worked to disenfranchise both poor whites and blacks, in order to end challenges from the Republican Party or Populists. Following Mississippi's passage of a new constitution in 1890 that disenfranchised most blacks, in 1898 the Democratically held state legislature of Louisiana passed a new constitution with provisions related to voter registration intended to disenfranchise most black voters; many poor white voters were also disenfranchised. The new constitution required payment of a poll tax (beyond the reach of many poor farmers who often traded in goods), literacy tests (which were administered in a discriminatory fashion, excluding educated blacks as well as those who were illiterate), property requirements, and a grandfather clause. The latter gave illiterate whites an opportunity to register if their ancestors had voted in 1867 or before the war, when blacks were excluded from voting. During the Solid South era, Louisiana democrats passed laws that provided for segregation. Blacks were essentially excluded from the political system for decades into the 1960s. Barred from voting, they were also excluded from juries and from holding local office. With the political system dominated by whites, black schools and facilities were consistently underfunded. In addition, their interests were not represented at the state or federal level. For instance, federal programs under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, developed to deal with widespread poverty during the Great Depression, overlooked black urban and rural needs in the South. =Civil rights era= In the era after World War II, black veterans and other leaders pressed to have their constitutional rights recognized: to be able to vote, use public places and facilities, and be treated as the United States citizens they were. In the early 1960s African Americans increased their efforts to create political change, at a time when there was social unrest related to cultural changes and gradually increasing opposition to the Vietnam War. In many southern states, white conservative voters began to vote for Republican presidential candidates, as a sign of their future political realignment. The national Democratic Party supported civil rights, as exemplified by President Lyndon B. Johnson gaining passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Many southern white conservative voters began to leave the Democratic Party for the Republican Party. Following passage of the Voting Rights Act, gradually African Americans in Louisiana and other states regained the ability to register and vote. Most affiliated with the national Democratic Party and supported its candidates. Voter turnout rose dramatically as African Americans rejoined the political process; people began to be politically active at all levels. They began to field their own candidates. From the 1930s, after many African Americans had left the state seeking work in other areas in the Great Migration, Louisiana has been majority white. Some areas have black majorities, as did New Orleans. The process of party switching appears to have been slower in Louisiana than in some other Southern states, as Democratic candidates continued to win governorships through the 20th century. 2000 to present =Hurricane Katrina= The evacuations and extensive damage to residential areas resulting from Hurricane Katrina had far-reaching political effects in the state. Because black residential areas of New Orleans were so damaged, many residents had to stay away, and some resettled in other states or cities. After the storm there was a twofold shift in the political electorate. \\"First, the exodus of Democratic voters to Texas, Florida and other parts of the country could affect local and statewide races in Louisiana--to the benefit of Republicans. At the same time, many of those who left New Orleans went to other parts of Louisiana, producing new micro-electorates where Democrats have moved into traditionally Republican areas.\\" One example of change was Baton Rouge, which gained an increase of 50,000 people after Katrina, many of them African Americans from the New Orleans area. The changes resulted in Democrat Don Cazayoux winning Louisiana's 6th congressional district \\"after more than three decades under Republican control.\\" =Recent elections= The shift of the white majority in the state into the Republican Party has continued in the 21st century. Because of demographic changes and political realignment, the Democratic Party has won fewer offices at the statewide and national levels in Louisiana. In 2004 Democrats held both Senate seats as well as six statewide offices. But in February 2011, Buddy Caldwell, Louisiana Attorney General and the only statewide elected Democrat, switched to the Republican Party of Louisiana. In September 2011, the Democratic Party did not field a major candidate for any of the statewide offices for the November elections. Despite this, the Democratic Party appears to be keeping its appeal at a local level. In November 2011, Democrats retained 45 seats in the Louisiana House of Representatives and added five new members; the House has a total of 105 members. =First Female Chair= In April 2012, the party's governing Committee, the 210-member State Central Committee, elected Karen Carter Peterson as chair, ousting former party leader Claude \\"Buddy\\" Leach. Peterson is the first female, and the second African American, to serve as party chair in the Louisiana Democratic Party's long history. Peterson is a member of the Louisiana State Senate from New Orleans.

For much of the time after the Civil War, the Democrats were a minor player in a political scene dominated by the Republican Party. However, during the 1950s, Edmund Muskie led an expansive political insurgency culminating in his election as Governor of Maine and successive Democratic elections to both state and national offices. From 2012 to 2019, despite having a Republican Governor in Paul LePage, the party remained strong, holding key offices in the state government and U.S. Congress and maintaining a majority in the Maine House of Representatives for six of LePage's eight years in office. The organizational structure of the party consists of party staff and party officers along with the house and senate. There are also several committees that are also involved in the Maine Democratic Party. The party in Maine has several goals they promote, which are laid out in the Democratic Party Platform. Current Democratic officeholders =Members of Congress= U.S. Senate *None Maine's U.S. Senate Class I seat has been held by Independent Angus King since 2012 (though King does caucus with the Senate Democrats) while the Class II seat has been held by Republican Susan Collins since 1996. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell was the last Democrat to represent Maine in the U.S. Senate. Appointed in May 1980 to fill the vacancy left by Edmund Muskie after Muskie's appointment as the U.S. Secretary of State, Mitchell was subsequently elected to a full term in 1982. After winning a second term in 1988, Mitchell opted to retire instead of seeking a third term. Congressman Thomas Andrews ran as the Democratic nominee in the 1994 election and was subsequently defeated by Republican challenger Olympia Snowe.

Muskie served as Governor, Senator and finally Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter. The Democratic Party has history dating back to the 1800s. Maine entered the Union in 1820 as an Anti-Federalist state. Soon after, in 1834, the Anti-Federalists adopted the Democratic Party name. The Democrats had limited success for nearly a hundred years, in part due to slavery. The Northeast was predominantly anti-slavery whereas the South was pro-slavery. When the Whig party split in 1856, most of its northern wing formed the Republican Party, which dominated Maine due to its anti-slavery stance. Maine was predominantly Republican until 1954. In 1954, in a gubernatorial election, Democratic state representative Edmund Muskie became only the fourth Democrat to win the governorship in the 20th century. He won the state over in part due to his stance on economic growth through industrial development, accessible politics on television and being acceptable to diverse population growth. Between 1954 and 1974, the number of registered Democrats more than doubled from 99,000 to 212,000. In more recent years, Maine has been roughly evenly split between Democrats, Republicans, and independents. For instance in 1990, independent registered voters constituted 37% of the electorate, Democrats 33%, and Republicans 30%. This is a great contrast to the first hundred years of Maine politics.Palmer, Kenneth T.Taylor, Thomas G. LiBrizzi, Marcus A (1992). Maine Politics and Government.

Democrat Janet Mills was elected Governor of Maine in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Party platform The Maine Democratic Party goals are to promote economic security, opportunities, health care, education, ethical government, freedom, safety and national security. Maine Democrats are also in support of civil rights, clean environment, global peace and security. These are the issues and guidelines the Maine Democratic elected officials base their political work around while serving the people of the state of Maine. The platform ensures economic security through a government run social security program. Extensive regulation of public and private pensions and secured protection of worker pension funds. Maine Democrats' promote fair workplace opportunities and promise workers of Maine the right to form unions through the Employee Free Choice Act, which gives employees' the chance to strike without being punished by employers and also keeps the workplace free of hazards, harassment, discrimination, etc. The Party Platform promotes nationalized health care, which is provided by the government and until this goal is reached they believe each state should develop their own health care system at the state level. The platform notes education as extremely important. They believe in, investing in educational institutions, and promoting lifelong learning. The platform also supports environmental protection through an energy plan to curb pollution and increase productivity. As noted in the Party Platform of the state of Maine, these are some of the principles and values the Democrats pledge to work on with local governments, and other states to ensure a better future for the state.\\"Maine Democratic Headquarters\\", October 30, 2011. Ideology George J. Mitchell, Senate Majority leader (1989-1995) The Ideology associated with the Maine Democrats can be classified as American Liberalism and Progressivism. Typically most Democrats are classified in these two ideologies. The focal point of present-day liberalism in Maine includes issues such as, voting rights for all adult citizens, equal rights, protection of the environment, and the provision by the government of social services such as, equal education opportunities, access to health care, transportation infrastructure, and help for those in serious poverty. For example, food and shelter. All of these principles and issues were a main focus on the 2010 Maine Party Platform. Progressivism is an ideology that stresses social, political and economic reforms. Progressives typically advocate reforms in areas such as, education, health care, political affairs, etc. For example, health care reform is progressive. From the traditional system to the universal single-payer system on the national level. The progressives want the reform. In Maine's Party Platform they advocate to stand by the single-payer health care system on the national level, which increasingly labels them part of the Progressivism ideology.

History Mississippi was a large supporter of Jacksonian Democracy, which occurred during the Second Party System (roughly 1820-1860s). At this time, Mississippi politics moved from a state divided between the Whigs and Democrats to a solid one-party Democratic state. At the time, the conservative Democratic Party strongly believed in states' rights as well as the right to the slave system. Tensions began to build between southern Democrats and northern Republicans and abolitionists. = Civil War and Reconstruction = In the summer of 1860, the Mississippi delegation walked out of the Democratic National Convention as a response to the convention's refusal to allow slavery in the state. Soon after, Mississippi seceded from the Union and joined many other states in forming the Confederate States of America. After the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Reconstruction began in the United States. Many laws were put in place to allow suffrage for African-Americans, which troubled white Democrats. Democrats overpowered the Republicans to combat these laws by means of force and violence in a method known as the Mississippi Plan, formulated in 1875 and implemented in the election of 1876. This plan was also used in other southern states to overthrow Republican rule. Thereafter, these states became known as the Solid South, meaning that they were solidly Democratic in political nature. This continued for the next seventeen presidential elections, until the elections of 1948. At this time, the national party began to show support for the Civil Rights Movement, which reduced its support in the Solid South. = 1948 presidential election and Dixiecrat movement = When the 1948 Democratic National Convention adopted a plank proposed by Northern liberals calling for civil rights, 35 southern delegates, including all Mississippi's delegates, walked out. Southern Democrats sought to exclude Harry Truman's name from the ballot in the South. The Southern defectors created a new party called the States' Rights Party (Dixiecrats), with its own nominees for the 1948 presidential election: Democratic South Carolina Governor J. Strom Thurmond for president and Fielding L. Wright, governor of Mississippi for vice president. (In his 1948 gubernatorial inaugural address, Wright had described racial segregation as an \\"eternal truth\\" that \\"transcends party lines\\".) The Dixiecrats thought that if they could win enough Southern states, they would have a good chance of forcing the election into the U.S. House of Representatives, where Southern bargaining power could determine the winner. To this end Dixiecrat leaders had the Thurmond-Wright ticket declared the official Democratic ticket in some Southern states, including Mississippi. (In other states, they were forced to run as a third party.) Efforts by the Dixiecrats to paint Southern Truman loyalists as turncoats generally failed, although the 1948 Mississippi state Democratic sample ballot warned that a vote for Truman electors was \\"a vote for Truman and his vicious anti-Southern program\\" and that a Truman victory would mean \\"our way of life in the South will be gone forever.\\" On election day of 1948, the Thurmond-Wright ticket carried Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Alabama, all previously solid Democratic states. Truman won the national election anyway, without their electoral votes. The States' Rights Party movement faded from the landscape, and its Mississippi leaders resumed their place in the ranks of the national Democratic Party with no repercussions, even though all seven incumbent Congressmen and Senator James O. Eastland had run on the Dixiecrat ballot with Thurmond and Governor Wright.1948 Mississippi \\"Official Democratic\\" (i.e., Dixiecrat) sample ballot issued by the Mississippi State Democratic Party; illustration in: Morgan, Chester. \\"Presidential Elections: Mississippi‚Äôs Voting History\\" Mississippi History Now Mississippi Historical Society; updated January 2009 =Civil Rights Movement and 1960-1963= In the fall of 1954, after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, Mississippi politicians in the state legislature reacted by approving and ratifying a constitutional amendment that would abolish the public school system. This provision, on the other hand, was never used. Soon, Mississippi became the focal point of national media when in August 1955, Emmett Till was lynched in Tallahatchie County. In 1957, Congress began to enact the first civil rights laws since the Reconstruction Era. By the time of the 1959 state elections, white Democrats acted to put a stop to this and elected Ross Barnett as governor. Democrats in Mississippi were not challenged in general elections and Barnett too ran unopposed. As a Dixiecrat, or States Rights Democrat, a member of the White Citizens' Council and by law on the board of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, Barnett was a staunch supporter of segregation laws, as had been his two challengers in the primary. By the time of the 1960 presidential elections, he refused to support John F. Kennedy or Richard Nixon. Barnett opted for the traditional route, while many other Mississippi Democratic officials supported Kennedy's campaign. The state party itself had declared, in its platform, to \\"reject and oppose the platforms of both national parties and their candidates\\" after the 1960 Democratic National Convention and its adoption of a civil rights platform. As a result of its insistence on maintaining segregation, Mississippi became a focal point for other major civil rights activity. Jackson's bus terminal was a stop for the Freedom Riders, civil rights activists who in 1961 rode interstate buses from Washington D.C. to New Orleans on routes through the segregated South to bring attention to the fact that localities in those states were ignoring federal desegregation law. When the buses made it to the Mississippi state line, by an arrangement between Governor Barnett and the Kennedy administration, police and the National Guard escorted them into Jackson where they were arrested and jailed for trying to use the bus station's whites-only facilities. = Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party = Established in April 1964, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) aimed to challenge discrimination based on race in the electoral process. It consisted of mainly disenfranchised African-Americans, although its membership was open to all Mississippians. The party was formed out of collaborative efforts from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Aaron Henry reading from a document while seated before the Credentials Committee In August 1964, a bus of MFDP delegates arrived at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City with the intention of asking to be seated as the Mississippi delegation There they challenged the right of the Mississippi Democratic Party's delegation to participate in the convention, claiming that the regulars had been illegally elected in a completely segregated process that violated both party regulations and federal law, and that furthermore the regulars had no intention of supporting Lyndon B. Johnson, the party's incumbent president, in the November election. They therefore asked that the MFDP delegates be seated rather than the segregationist regulars.The Mississippi Movement & the MFDP ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans The Democratic Party referred the challenge to the Convention Credentials Committee, which televised its proceedings, which allowed the nation to see and hear the testimony of the MFDP delegates, particularly the testimony of Fannie Lou Hamer, whose evocative portrayal of her hard brutalized life as a sharecropper on the plantation owned by Jamie Whitten, a long time Mississippi congressman and chairman of the House Agricultural Committee, drew public attention. Some of the all-white delegations from other southern states threatened to leave the convention and bolt the party as in 1948 if the regular Mississippi delegation was unseated, and Johnson feared losing Southern support in the coming campaign against Republican Party candidate Barry Goldwater. With the help of Vice President Hubert Humphrey (chief sponsor of the 1948 civil rights resolution which sparked the 1948 Dixiecrat walk-out) and Party leader Walter Mondale, Johnson engineered a \\"compromise\\" in which the national Democratic Party offered the MFDP two at-large seats which allowed them to watch the floor proceedings but not take part. The MFDP refused this \\"compromise\\" which permitted the undemocratic, white-only, regulars to keep their seats and denied votes to the MFDP. Denied official recognition, the MFDP kept up their agitation within the Convention. When all but three of the \\"regular\\" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to support Johnson against Goldwater, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic northern delegates and took the seats vacated by the Mississippi delegates, only to be removed by the national Party; when they returned the next day, convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there yesterday. Though the MFDP failed to unseat the regulars at the convention, and many activists felt betrayed by Johnson, Humphrey, and the liberal establishment, they did succeed in dramatizing the violence and injustice by which the white power structure governed Mississippi, maintained control of the Democratic Party of Mississippi, and disenfranchised black citizens. The MFDP and its convention challenge eventually helped pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The MFDP continued as an alternate for several years, and many of the people associated with it continued to press for civil rights in Mississippi. After passage of the Act, the number of registered black voters in Mississippi grew dramatically. The Mississippi Democratic Party agreed to conform to the national Democratic Party rules, guaranteeing fair participation, and eventually the MFDP merged into the party. Many MFDP activists became Party leaders and in some cases officeholders. There is only one chapter of the MFDP still active, in Holmes County, Mississippi. =Towards a modern Democratic Party= After the controversy of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in 1964, Democrats sought party representatives and officials that understood the need to compromise. They looked for a more moderate stance. This was tested during the election of 1968, the first in which African Americans were officially and legally enfranchised. When President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not be running for a second full term, Mississippians took stock in the independent George Wallace. His campaign was an outlet for white southerners to express their anger and frustration with the civil rights movement. It was also at this time that the Democratic Party went through drastic changes, when the national convention made the decision to award 1968 convention seats to the new \\"Loyalist\\" faction of the state Democratic Party, instead of the \\"regulars\\" (being \\"the old guard conservative delegation composed of the governor and others from Mississippi\\")‚Äîthe first time in history an entire delegation had been denied and replaced. The Loyalist Democratic party became official in June 1968 and encompassed the concerns of such groups as the NAACP, Young Democrats and the MFDP. In 1972, Governor Bill Waller attempted to unify the \\"regulars\\" and the \\"loyalists,\\" without success. That year, Mississippi sent two delegations to the national convention, but the convention committee once again supported the loyalists. Efforts continued to reunite these two factions before the election of 1976. After the election of 1976, it was clear that the Democrats were losing speed in the South. It became difficult to merge and force cooperation between the regulars and the loyalists, and conservative Republicans began to make inroads. In 1980 Republican Ronald Reagan kicked off his presidential campaign in Mississippi, with the Neshoba County Fair \\"states' rights\\" speech, and Southern liberal Democrat Jimmy Carter lost in a landslide to Reagan that year; more of the state began to vote Republican. This was a trend across the South. In 1991, the governorship was taken away from Democrats when Republican Kirk Fordice won the election. Republicans consolidated this power between 1994 and 1996. At the end of the 1996 general election, Republicans held three of the five congressional seats in addition to both U.S. senators, as well as a gain in the state legislature. Democrats, no longer the Dixiecrats of the past and \\"by the 1970s resolutely committed to biracial Democratic Party politics\\", had lost significant power at both the state and national level. Governors and legislators over the decades have called for rewrites of Mississippi's Constitution. The current Constitution was created in 1890,After years of attempts, a convention to address rewriting the Constitution was successfully called that year, possibly to stave off threatened federal supervision of state and local elections. Winkle p. 13. crafted explicitly to replace the 1868 enfranchising constitution of Reconstruction days. It has experienced many amendments‚Äîas of 2014, 121 approved since 1890, more than 75 since 1960‚Äîand outright repeals, mostly as a result of U.S. Supreme Court rulings. However, according to John W. Winkle III, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Mississippi, \\"More than a century later, the 1890 Constitution, with its rather severe limitations on government and its antiquated organization and content, still shadows the state.\\" Current Mississippi Democrats  The Mississippi Democratic Party has gradually become the minority party in the state. However, the party is still strong in Mississippi. The 2012 presidential election was the strongest showing for a Democratic presidential candidate in the state, 43.79% of the vote went to President Barack Obama, since Bill Clinton, a native Southerner, in 1996.

There is also an organization of self-styled Yellow-Dog Democrats. The term \\"Yellow Dog Democrat\\" refers to someone (typically in the South) who is staunchly loyal to the Democratic Party.

The party Chairman is Jean Peters Baker, who has been serving in that position since 2018. President Harry Truman (1945‚àí1953) History The Missouri Democratic Party politics were characterized by diverse cultural, economic and social issues which led to antagonism between two factions of the party in the 1920s. The conflicts, mainly due to the dysfunctional relationship between Senator Jim Reed and President Woodrow Wilson, led to a disruption for the Missouri Democratic Party, degrading the party to minority status throughout most of the 1920s. The dispute was over whether the US should join the League of Nations or not. Reed strongly opposed this while President Wilson was a strong supporter of it. This question led to debate in many states but none was so affected as Missouri.Mitchell, Franklin D. Missouri Democracy - Missouri Democratic Politics, 1919-1932. University of Missouri, 1968 #p.16)\\" President Wilson wanted to form a strong national leadership, while Reed wanted more state control.Mitchell, Franklin D. Missouri Democracy - Missouri Democratic Politics, 1919-1932. University of Missouri, 1968 #p.17#\\" Despite most Missourian Democrats favoring entrance to the organization, Reed remained firm in his stand, which caused some state Democrats to create their own pro-League club called \\"The Missouri State Democratic Club\\".Mitchell, Franklin D. Missouri Democracy - Missouri Democratic Politics, 1919-1932. University of Missouri, 1968 #p.24#\\" Among the supporters for Reed were mainly Irish immigrants settled in the urban part of Missouri. The supporters for the President mainly resided in the more rural parts of the state.Mitchell, Franklin D. Missouri Democracy - Missouri Democratic Politics, 1919-1932. University of Missouri, 1968 #p.161#\\" Another big issue within Democratic politics was the prohibition issue. In the state of Missouri, wet candidates tended to win office, although dry candidates were found both in the Democratic and the Republican party. Republicans managed to agree to a higher degree than Democrats on a wet stand, which might be one of the reasons why they managed to win all of the presidential and gubernatorial elections during the 1920s. The African-American part of the state population, who earlier had favored the GOP, for the most part switched sides in the beginning of the 1930s. This was partly caused by the Democratic Party's 1928 backing of Joseph L. McLemore for Congress, making it the first ever nomination of an African- American for Congress.Mitchell, Franklin D. Missouri Democracy - Missouri Democratic Politics, 1919-1932. University of Missouri, 1968 #p.163#\\" Also contributing to the change was the Republicans' inability to handle the Great Depression. During the phase-out of the party bosses, power moved from Kansas City to St. Louis, which had been a Democratic city since 1933. In the 2010 elections, the Missouri Democratic Party won three of the nine House of Representatives districts.Pear, Robert \\"The New York Times\\" That is a loss of one seat compared to the 2008 House of Representative elections.Hernandez, Javier C. \\"The New York Times\\" On a national level Missouri is known as a swing state. The voters of Missouri have voted against the eventual winner three times in the presidential elections, favoring Adlai Stevenson over Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, John McCain over Barack Obama in 2008, and Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2012. \\"http://www.270towin.com/states/Missouri\\" Harry S. Truman is probably the most influential person in the history of the Missouri Democratic Party. Truman played an important role in Missouri politics after the depression in 1929. He was one of the main beneficiaries of the powerful Tom Pendergast organization. The backing of the organization helped Truman secure Missouri's senator seat in the 1932 election.Mitchell, Franklin D. Missouri Democracy - Missouri Democratic Politics, 1919-1932. University of Missouri, 1968 #p.164#\\" Truman later on, in 1944, got elected vice president to Franklin D. Roosevelt. After Roosevelt's death Missouri got its first President. Truman remained in the seat even after the 1948 election, given a large support from his home state. Especially the African-American part of the population, appreciative of Roosevelt's New Deal and Truman's Fair Deal program, stayed loyal to the Democratic Party. The Missouri Democrats take a social and liberal stand on economic and public policy issues following realignments that occurred during the mid- to late-20th century.

Early & private life Jimmy Murray was born to John and Susan (n√©e Walls) Murray in 1917. His mother, a native of Magherafelt, County Londonderry, was a teacher and his father ran a grocery shop and pub. Murray grew up in Knockcroghery, County Roscommon and was educated at the local national school, at Harrison Hall technical school and the De La Salle Brothers school in Roscommon. From an early age he was a Gaelic football fanatic and showed great skill at his favourite game. Murray was married to Ann Costello from Headford, County Galway. The couple had five children. She died in 1992. Murray was a publican by profession. Away from the field of play, he was a lover of music, especially famous tenors such as Athlone's John McCormack and Mario Lanza. His party piece was \\"The West's Awake\\" and the song became the title of a charity CD he produced in 2003 - a recording debutant at the age of 85.Jimmy himself inspired a tune (\\"Famous Jimmy Murray\\")recorded by Welsh folk band Allan Yn Y Fan. Playing career =Club= Murray had great success as a club footballer. He played with his local St. Patrick's club in Knockcroghery, as well as hurling with Roscommon Gaels. In all he won six Roscommon SFC in 1942, 1943, 1945, 1946, 1948 and 1949. Murray was also a hurler of note and he won a Roscommon SHC medal with the Gaels club in 1938. =Inter-county= Murray's hugely successful inter-county career began in 1939. That year he played on a Roscommon team that defeated Limerick in the All-Ireland junior football semi- final, only to lose to Dublin in the final. A year later Roscommon returned to win the final with a comprehensive triumph over Westmeath. The stock of Roscommon football was on the rise and more experienced players like Jimmy Murray, Dr Donal Keenan (later to serve as president of the GAA), Owensie Hoare and Hugh Gibbons looked forward to the arrival on the senior team of the young players who won All-Ireland minor titles for the county in 1939 and 1941. The senior breakthrough came in 1943 when Roscommon defeated Galway in the Connacht final, a victory that Jimmy Murray later described as \\"our greatest victory until that point\\". They went on to beat Louth in the All- Ireland semi-final and captured their first senior All-Ireland title with a 2-7 to 2-2 win over Cavan. Murray‚Äôs performance in this match was his finest hour - he had taken Roscommon from oblivion to the All-Ireland title. His brother Phelim also played on that team, and again in 1944, when Roscommon defeated the traditional powerhouses of the game, Kerry, to add a second title. They were among the select few sets of brothers to play together in and win All-Ireland titles. In 1946, Roscommon came tantalisingly close to adding a third title, however, in the All-Ireland final against Kerry, Murray sustained a broken nose, but came back on to the field to almost score a late winning point. Kerry won the day by 2-8 to 0-10. As a Gaelic footballer, Jimmy Murray was a stylish and tenacious centre forward who made little of his relatively small stature to thrive in an era when physical strength was celebrated. He had outstanding leadership qualities, and even today his name is cited in Roscommon and national Gaelic Athletic Association circles as a man to be emulated. Records Murray is regarded as one of the Gaelic Athletic Association's most decorated Gaelic footballers. The Knockcroghery man is one of only eight captains to lift the Sam Maguire Cup twice. The other seven captains are Declan O'Sullivan and Joe Barrett of Kerry, J. J. O'Reilly of Cavan, Se√°n Flanagan of Mayo, Enda Colleran of Galway, Tony Hanahoe of Dublin and Brian Dooher of Tyrone. Murray was also the only Roscommon man ever to captain the county to ultimate glory. He was the first man ever to captain a team to back-to-back All-Ireland senior football wins and also still has the distinction of being the only captain to have led a team in five separate All- Ireland senior final match appearances (1943, 1943 replay, 1944, 1946, 1946 replay). In recognition of his skills and long-running contribution to the sport, Murray was awarded the 1993 All-time all-star award as no GAA All Stars Awards were being issued at the time of his playing career. Retirement In November 2003 Jimmy recorded an album \\"The West's Awake\\" in his pub in Knockroghery. The proceeds went to Lean ar Aghaidh Resource Centre, Roscommon, for Children with Special Needs. In November 2005 he signed a Limited Edition photo of himself with the Sam Maguire Cup (All Ireland Senior Football Cup) to raise funds for the International Relief and Development Agency GOAL. In October 2006 members of the Roscommon minor football team stopped at Murray's pub in Knockcroghery as they transported the All-Ireland minor trophy (Tom Markham Cup) back to the county after defeating Kerry in a replay. \\"It was a very emotional moment. He was old and feeble, but it meant so much to the players to meet Jimmy,\\" said a Roscommon county board official who witnessed the meeting. Jimmy Murray died peacefully on 23 January 2007. At the age of 89 he was the oldest surviving double All-Ireland winning captain.

It is headed by state chairman William McCurdy II. History The state of Nevada has had 22 political parties over the years.Hal K. Rothman. The Making of Modern Nevada. Fall 2010. September 8, 2011. Only six of these parties lasted up until the 2004 elections. These six parties are the Democrats, Republicans, Independent Americans, Greens, Natural Law Party and Libertarians. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party remain as the top two in the state. With the help of Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Nevada became the 36th state in America. Lincoln‚Äôs Republican influence was considerable among the Nevada state citizens during his presidency. The first two general elections in Nevada, held in 1864 and 1867, were dominated by the Republican Party. In 1871, the Democratic Party started to gain momentum and won four of the six constitutional offices: governor, lieutenant governor, state treasurer and attorney general. Towards the beginning of the 1900s, the Silver Party was formed, bringing many Republicans and Democrats together from the western states. The party was so-named because of the federal government‚Äôs shortage of silver coins in 1873. The Silver Party played a prominent role in Nevada‚Äôs politics in the 1894 and 1898 elections. The Silver Party later formed the Silver Democratic Party. The Silver Democratic Party was prominent in Nevada until the election of 1906. After the election of 1906, the Democratic and Republican parties became the two primary parties in Nevada. During the Great Depression of 1929, the two primary parties split many constitutional and federal offices. After the Great Depression, the citizens of Nevada preferred the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. Democrats were well received by Nevada and won most of the statewide and federal races from 1932 until 1995. In the 2014 election cycle, Anatole Jenkins served as the Coordinated Campaign Field Director, being the first African American to hold that position in Nevada. In 2016, Cory Warfield became the second African American to serve in such a role. Convention platform The current platform for the party was ratified in 2020.

New Hampshire presidential primary New Hampshire holds the first primary in the nation to kick off an election cycle every four years. This is a part of the long process in choosing nominations for both the Democratic and Republican parties. New Hampshire plays a key role in choosing nominees due to the massive amounts of media attention it gets. Being first involves having a huge impact on the process as a whole by setting the bar for latter states. New Hampshire has been a bellwether for politicians seeking election. A weak showing in New Hampshire has caused office seekers to drop out of the race early. In 1952 and in 1968 Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson both drop their reelection campaigns after poor showings in the New Hampshire primary. New Hampshire started holding a primary in 1916 and has held the First in the Nation primary since 1920. At first voters could only vote on delegates to send the party national conventions. It was Richard F. Upton, speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, who amended the law to allow for direct vote of presidential candidates. In 1952 New Hampshire voters started voting for the candidates. This new law inspired the voters of New Hampshire to write in Dwight D.

She was one of many Jewish actors and actresses that were forced to flee Europe when the Nazis came to power in 1933. Biography Berliner was born Gertrude Berliner in Berlin, Germany. She became a famous cabaret performer in Berlin. In 1925, she appeared in her first movie, a silent film called Krieg im Frieden. Berliner would wait four years before her second movie, but her film career would then take off. In 1929, she appeared in Dich hab ich geliebt, which would become the first German talkie released in the United States. Berliner appeared in a number of well known movies in Germany during the 1930s, including Masken, The Invisible Front, ' and Kaiserwalzer. Es war einmal ein Musikus (1933) was her last movie in Germany; it also featured S.Z. Sakall, in the fourth German movie that the two appeared in together. Being Jewish, she left Germany when Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 and went to France. In 1939, she immigrated to the United States. However, in Hollywood Berliner was not able to continue her promising movie career, receiving only bit roles in four movies. Her first role in an American film did not come until 1942, in Casablanca. She portrayed a woman playing baccarat with a Dutch banker (played by Torben Meyer). She appears in a scene with her four-time co-star from her career in Germany, S.Z. Sakall, when she says to his character, Carl the waiter, \\"Will you ask Rick if he will have a drink with us?\\", to which Carl responds, \\"Madame, he never drinks with customers. Never. I have never seen it.\\" Later that year, she had another bit part in the World War II romance Reunion in France, and in 1943 she played Frau Reitler in The Strange Death of Adolf Hitler. Her last American movie was a small uncredited role as a German actress in the musical The Dolly Sisters in 1945, again appearing with S.Z. Sakall. She did not appear on film again until 1955, with a small role in her final film, the West German production '. Berliner lived quietly in California until she died on February 26, 1977 in San Diego, just two days shy of her 74th birthday.

The party is led by Chairwoman Marg Elliston. Historical development New Mexico Territory elected its first delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1850: Richard Hanson Weightman, a Democrat. At this time, the Democratic Party was socially conservative and many Democrats supported expanding the institution of slavery into new Western territories. This pro-slavery position stopped New Mexico's first attempt at a state constitution (which prohibited slavery) from being ratified in 1850, preventing the territory from becoming a state. In the early 1900s, Democratic politician Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo led a movement in favor of civil rights for Hispanic and Latino Americans and Spanish speakers in New Mexico. He found that most Latinos identified as Republicans, which disturbed Larrazolo because he felt that the Republican political machine in the territory was exploiting its Hispanic voters. When New Mexico Territory was preparing to become a state in 1910, Larrazolo was selected as a delegate to the constitutional convention. He succeeded in making sure that the state's constitution protected and guaranteed the political, civil, and religious rights of those of Spanish and Mexican descent. However, other state Democrats opposed these protections and unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the new constitution from being ratified. After being opposed by his own party, Larrazolo became a Republican and served as a Republican governor and senator from New Mexico.Cline, Dorothy I. New Mexico's 1910 Constitution: A 19th Century Product. Santa Fe: The Lightning Tree, 1985. Like the national Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of New Mexico underwent significant ideological changes throughout the 20th century. Since the growth of social liberalism began in the party, Democrats have found success in New Mexico. Between 1931 and 1951, and again between 1971 and 1987, all executive offices in the state were consistently held by Democrats. With brief exceptions, there have generally been Democratic majorities in both houses of the New Mexico Legislature since 1930. In 1977, the Democratic Women of New Mexico caucus was founded with the purpose of promoting women's voices in the state and national party. As of 2018, the Democratic Party of New Mexico is made up of county party organizations in all of the state's 33 counties, and is governed by the State Central Committee of DPNM, which meets to conduct the regular business of the organization and elect its officers. In addition to the Democratic Women of New Mexico, now chaired by Pam Cordova, the party has a Native American Democratic Caucus chaired by Tracy Goodluck, and a Labor Caucus chaired by Ray Baca. There are also party committees for dealing with specific ongoing issues, including the affirmative action, budget, platforms and resolution, and rules committees, and the judicial council. Ideological and issue stances The New Mexico Democratic Party stated its ideological stances in its 2014 platform. Economically, the party supports a balanced budget made possible by progressive taxation, and promotes fair trade and fair labor practices. Like the national Democratic Party, the DPNM supports environmental protections and emphasizes the importance of natural resources such as land and water. On issues of social welfare, the party believes that every citizen should have the right to universal health care, access to education, and guaranteed Social Security. The party aims to protect tribal sovereignty and make sure all Native Americans are recognized in the state. Additionally, the cultural affairs and arts section ensures that all art of the state is protected and supported by the community. Current Democratic officeholders On the federal level, both of New Mexico's senators and all three representatives are Democrats. On the state level, all of the state's seven executive offices are held by Democrats. Democrats hold supermajorities in both houses of the New Mexico State Legislature. =Members of Congress= Democrats comprise all of New Mexico's 5 Congressional delegation - both US Senators and all 3 member of the House of Representatives.

Since January 20, 2015 the party has held all five statewide executive offices. Party platforms and ideology The state Democratic Party has recently made economic factors a major component of its platform, with advocacy for middle class workers of particular prominence. The party has also opposed Republican- sponsored legislation to require a photo ID for voting, asserting that such a requirement would discourage minorities, youth, and those with low-income from voting because they are less likely to possess a state-issued ID. Additionally, the party has committed itself to maintaining the social safety net, and encouraging more transparency in state government.http://www.padems.com/issues History The Pennsylvania Democratic Party traces its history to 1792. Pennsylvania Democrat James Buchanan, was elected President in 1856, but did not seek re-election four years later, when Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, was elected President. Buchanan's rise and fall from political prominence coincided with that of the state Democratic Party in Pennsylvania; for much of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the party was largely out of power.http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/us/A0860294.htmlhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/jamesbuchanan Recent history The party held the governorship from 2003 to 2011 with the election of Ed Rendell in 2002 and his re-election in 2006. The party lost control of the governorship following the election of Republican state Attorney General Tom Corbett in 2010. In the 2014 U.S elections governor Tom Corbett lost reelection to democrat Tom Wolf, the former Secretary of Revenue of Pennsylvania. The party picked up a Senate seat in 2006 with the election of Bob Casey, Jr. Pennsylvania Democrats also briefly held both of the state's U.S. Senate seats following Arlen Specter's party-switch. However, Congressman Joe Sestak defeated Specter in the May 2010 primary, before losing the fall general election to former Congressman Pat Toomey. On the state legislative level, the party won a majority in the State House in 2006 and again in 2008. The party lost its majority in that chamber in the 2010 election.

Critics cited Groen's silence on sexual misconduct allegations against prominent state politicians, his failure to fulfill a commitment to create a party sexual misconduct policy after the alleged sexual assault of a state party delegate at the 2016 DNC, and his anger over calls to dismiss a close aide's controversial statements about the #MeToo movement as evidence of Groen's unwillingness to address sexual misconduct within the party.

From the 12th century they ruled extensive territories in the Rhine Main area from their castle in Eppstein, northwest of Frankfurt, Germany. History The coat of arms of the Lords of Eppstein Between 1180 and 1190, the Archbishop of Mainz enfeoffed Eppstein Castle, along with neighboring district courts and villages to Gerhard III of Hainhausen. Gerhard changed his name to Eppstein and already having control of the present-day district of Offenbach, became the first in the line which was soon to become one of the most influential families in the Rhine Main area. The castle of the Eppsteins by Matth√§us Merian in 1646 Four of the seven Archbishops of Mainz and Electoral Princes in the 13th century were of the house of Eppstein. They raised the Electorate to considerable power and played a significant role in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire. In the struggle between the Emperor and the Pope, Archbishop Siegfried III took sides with the anti-Staufer group which played an important part in the beginnings of German federalism. The secular Eppsteiners, by purchase, marriage and enfeoffment, acquired extensive territories and rights between Middle Rhine to the Vogelsberg hills and between the Lahn River to the Odenwald. The realm of the Lords of Eppstein was divided in 1433 between brothers Gottfried VII (Eppstein-M√ºnzenberg) and Eberhard II (Eppstein-K√∂nigstein). The last of these branches became extinct in 1535 and Eppstein was passed mostly to the Landgraves of Hesse and the Ecclesiastical Principality of Mainz.

It has been variously described as 'the largest such plant in the world' Winchester C (Ed), Handling 2,000,000 tons of coal, Wonders of World Engineering P309-313, The Amalgamated Press, 1937 and 'the largest gas works in Europe'.Carr R.J.M (Ed), Dockland: An illustrated historical survey of life and work in east London, NELP/GLC, 1986, It operated from 1870 to 1976, with an associated by-products works that operated from 1879 to 1970. The works were located on East Ham Level, on the north bank of the Thames at Gallions Reach, to the west of Barking Creek. History The plant was opened in 1870 by the Gas Light and Coke Company (GLCC). The name Beckton was given to the plant and the surrounding area of east London in honour of the company's governor Simon Adams Beck (1803-1883). It came eventually to manufacture gas for most of London north of the Thames, with numerous smaller works being closed. Its counterpart south of the river was the South Metropolitan Gas Co's East Greenwich Gas Works on the Greenwich Peninsula. Gasholder at Beckton Gas Works, in 2007 Town gas was produced using coal carbonisation and was conveyed to central London through a 48-inch (1.22 m) diameter gas main to the City of London with an extension to Westminster. The 48-inch main was subsequently duplicated. To augment gas supplies the GLCC built a carburetted water gas (CWG) plant at Beckton in 1890 capable of producing 10 million cubic feet per day (283,166 m3/d). The capacity of the CWG plant had risen to 40 million cubic feet per day (1.133 million m3/d) by 1934. However, the majority of the gas was still produced by coal carbonisation. After the Second World War a major reconstruction project was undertaken by the civil engineer T. P. O'Sullivan of Brian Colquhoun and Partners. Following nationalisation in 1949 the plant was owned by the North Thames Gas Board. Ruins of the Beckton Gas Works from the Gallions Reach DLR station, 1994 In 1949 Beckton was the largest gas works in the world, capable of producing a total of 119.12 million cubic feet of gas per day (3.37 million m3/day). Over the next 20 years a series of upgrades to the works were undertaken: * In 1952 a modern carburetted water gas plant was built with a capacity of 20 million cubic feet per day (566,332 m3/day). * During 1957 a butane/air plant was built at Beckton to augment peak-load gas supplies. * In 1959 a catalytic reforming plant was commissioned. This used tail gases from the refineries at Coryton and Shell Haven, delivered by pipeline, as a feedstock to manufacture town gas. * In 1968 another large gas reforming plant was built at Beckton producing 100 million cubic feet of gas per day (2.8 million m3/day). The plant initially operated with liquefied petroleum gases as a feedstock until North Sea gas became available in 1969. Remains of Beckton Gas Works retort- houses, in 1996 The coal carbonisation plant at Beckton became uncompetitive with North Sea gas and was closed in 1969, which was also when the last trainload left the associated chemical works. Beckton still produced town gas using its reforming plants - with a total gas reforming capacity of 143 million cubic feet gas per day (4.05 million m3/day). The reforming plants operated until 1976; Beckton was the location of the last town gas to natural gas domestic conversions in the North Thames Gas Board supply area on 29 August 1976. At its peak Beckton had employed 4,500 people, but by the late 1970s only 100 employees remained. After closure the residual site passed to British Gas and Transco. The works lay within the London Docklands area and parts were redeveloped by the London Docklands Development Corporation. Location Beckton Gas and Product Works and surrounding area in the 1890s The works covered a site to the south of the Northern Outfall Sewer, between Woolwich Manor Way and the Thames. The company had considered several sites for the works. The site to the west of Barking Creek was selected as it was possible to build deep water piers in the Thames, enabling direct unloading from steam colliers bringing coal from mines in the North-East of England.Clifford,T., notes to Old Ordnance Survey Maps: Beckton 1914, The Godfrey Edition, Alan Godfrey Maps, 2000, Gateshead, There were two piers, for importing coal and exporting by-products. In the 1930s an annual average of a million tons of coal mainly from Durham was unloaded at the main pier, with a further 750,000 tons transhipped to barges for other works. The GLCC had a fleet of seventeen coastal colliers ranging from 1,200 to 2,841 gross register tons, and also chartered larger ships as needed. At this time the plant had a coal storage capacity of 250,000 tons. The plant had an extensive internal railway system of between and featured some unusual elevated sidings that also ran out on a number of piers into the Thames. The Beckton Railway provided a link to the national network at Custom House, used for passenger traffic to the works and for transport of by-products such as coal tar. This was leased and operated by the Great Eastern Railway from 1874. There were no intermediate stations between Custom House station and Beckton railway station, which was at the entrance to the works. The line closed to passengers following bomb damage in 1940, the freight line finally closing in February 1971.Jackson A.A, London's Local Railways, David & Charles, 1978, Beckton Products Works Following the invention of coal gas early in the 19th century, it was discovered that numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry ‚Äì the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry ‚Äì came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers.Hunt A, Cities of Science Subsequently, the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, ammonium sulphate and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and dicyclopentadiene. Since the Products works was dependent on by-products of gas manufacture it could not long survive the introduction of natural gas. The last train carrying chemical products, a load of pitch, left the works on 1 June 1970. Beckton Alps Beckton Alps and Gas Works 1973, from the A13 The toxic spoil heaps from the works are known ironically as Beckton Alps. Originally covering an extensive area to the west of the works, they have been landscaped and much reduced in size. From 1989 to 2001 a dry ski slope, opened by Diana, Princess of Wales, was operated on the small remaining section (), though the nickname pre-dates this. The site is the highest point in Newham, and a Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade II. It is said to be the highest artificial hill in London.The highest artificial hill in London(Cities of Science) accessed 3 March 2008 In 2003, a proposed ¬£35m replacement for the site - the SnowWorld indoor centre - ran into financial problems.Cresney's plans for Beckton(London SnowWorld News) accessed 3 March 2008 The site was acquired for development as a hotel in 2013. The A13/A117 road junction is also named Beckton Alps.SABRE http://www.sabre- roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Beckton_Alps During 2013 the sheets of corrugated iron situated on top of the former dry sky slope were painted in the colour of the Lithuanian national flag (the site is adjacent to London's largest Lithuanian supermarket) but later covered up with the St George Cross in retaliation. Beckton Gasworks as a film location The Gasworks, Products Works and Alps were used as a location for TV and cinema filming on a number of occasions. In the 1960s comedy films and TV programmes, such as Michael Bentine‚Äôs It's a Square World, were shot here. The mounds of chemical waste were used to portray mountaineering scenes. In 1975 the film Brannigan starring John Wayne used the location. The opening sequence of the 1981 James Bond movie For Your Eyes Only was filmed here. The scenes involved Roger Moore as James Bond attempting to regain control of a helicopter operated by remote control by his nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. The gasworks buildings were also used in a number of scenes representing a dystopian 1984 London in the 1984 film version of the George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. In 1986, the film Biggles: Adventures in Time used the gasworks as a location for a weapon testing ground. Neil Dickson, who played Biggles in Biggles: Adventures in Time, played a similar character in the 1987 film It Couldn't Happen Here, a surreal, musical journey through the songs of the pop duo Pet Shop Boys. In the film, Dickson drives Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe to a apocalyptic wasteland, the scenes of which were filmed at Beckton, very close to the same area used in Stanley Kubrick‚Äôs 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. Patrick Keiller's 1997 film Robinson in Space visits Beckton, including 'East Ham Churchyard' (\\"the largest in England\\" noted the narrator Paul Scofield) opposite Beckton Alps. Asylum, a 2000 film of Iain Sinclair and Chris Petit for Channel 4, was partially shot at Beckton Alps while it was still a dry-ski slope. In the final hour or so of Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's 1987 movie portraying the Vietnam War, Matthew Modine (Private Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother) and their platoon go into Hu·∫ø, a Vietnamese city, to clear it of Viet Cong and snipers. Kubrick had the whole gasworks selectively demolished and the art department then dressed the 'set' with latticework and appropriate advertising hoardings to make it believable. At one point the soldiers enter a building to flush out a sniper. This building was one of several located between the central buildings of the old gasworks and about 200 yards from the river Thames. The final scene sees the soldiers marching off into the (London) sunset against the silhouettes of the burning gasworks' chimneys and buildings, singing the Mickey Mouse March from the US children's TV show. In the film a period of several days takes place in the protagonists' lives as they travel through Hu·∫ø city; in reality the action took place within just . According to Kubrick collaborator Leon Vitali, who worked on Full Metal Jacket, the gasworks were built by an architectural firm that also constructed much of Hu·∫ø. Within weeks, British pop/rock trio The Outfield filmed multiple sequences for the video to the band's 1987 hit \\"Since You've Been Gone\\", from their album Bangin', at Beckton Gasworks. The video for Loop's 1990 single 'Arc-lite' was filmed on the set of Full Metal Jacket. The gasworks was used as the main background scene for the Oasis video 'D'You Know What I Mean?', as it shows the band members playing on a concrete slab within the gasworks. The videoclip for Marcella Detroit's 1994 single 'I Believe' was shot in this location. Also, the 1995 TV series Bugs episode 'Out Of The Hive' shows the entire works in a scene where a car drives off an unfinished bridge in flames. Derek Jarman's 1986 promotional video for The Smiths 'The Queen is Dead' single was partly shot at Beckton Gasworks. Part of the 1985 Max Headroom TV Movie 20 Minutes into the future was shot at Beckton Gasworks. Present Virtually no trace of the old gasworks now exists. Bisected by many roads, including the A1020 Royal Docks Road, a small area of the waste tip and some gas holders remain, separated by or so of redevelopment. Parts of the site are occupied by an industrial estate, the Beckton Retail Park and Gallions Reach Shopping Park. Part of the extensive industrial railway route has since been used for the Docklands Light Railway between Beckton DLR station and the Royal Docks Road. The site also houses the Beckton DLR depot.

Rogers disappeared in June 1965 after police discovered the dismembered bodies of his elderly parents in the refrigerator of the Houston home all three shared, in what the media later dubbed \\"The Icebox Murders\\". Rogers has never been found and was declared dead in absentia in July 1975. He remains the only suspect in the murders, which are still considered unsolved. Background and education In 1942, Charles Rogers enrolled at Texas A&M; University but later dropped out. He then enrolled at the University of Houston, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in nuclear physics. During World War II, Rogers was a pilot in the United States Navy and also served in the Office of Naval Intelligence. After the war, he worked as a seismologist for Shell Oil for nine years. He abruptly quit his job in 1957 without giving an explanation. Friends and associates of Rogers later said that he was highly intelligent and had a talent for finding gas, oil and gold for companies that he worked for. He also spoke seven languages and had an interest in ham radios. In the mid-1950s, Rogers joined the Civil Air Patrol where he reportedly met David Ferrie, an alleged conspirator in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Murders and disappearance By 1965, Rogers was unemployed and living with his elderly parents, Fred Christopher (born January 19, 1884) and Edwina Ivor Rogers (n√©e Harman; born October 8, 1892), in the Montrose neighborhood of Houston. Described as \\"reclusive\\", Rogers was reported to have communicated with his parents by way of notes slipped under the door. Neighbors were unaware that Rogers lived with his parents as he generally left the home before dawn and did not return until after dark. On June 23, 1965, two Houston police officers forced their way into the Rogers' home after Edwina's nephew Marvin reported that his phone calls to his aunt went unanswered for days. Upon entering the home, police found nothing unusual but noticed food sitting on the dining room table. One officer opened the refrigerator and found what appeared to be numerous cuts of washed, unwrapped meat neatly stacked on the shelves. The officer later recalled that he thought the meat was that of a butchered hog.Benson p.386 As the officer was closing the door, he noticed two human heads visible through the clear glass of the vegetable bin. The heads were those of Fred and Edwina Rogers. What the officer initially thought was unwrapped cuts of hog meat were the couple's dismembered limbs and torsos. Police later discovered the couple's organs in a nearby sewer (the organs had been removed, cut up and flushed down the toilet) while other remains were never found. Police determined that Fred and Edwina Rogers had been killed on June 20, Father's Day. An autopsy showed that Fred was killed by blows to the head with a claw hammer. His eyes had been gouged out and his genitalia were removed. Edwina had been beaten and shot, execution style, in the head. Police further said that the bodies were dismembered in the upstairs bathroom by a person \\"with some knowledge of anatomy\\". There was little blood in the house and it appeared it had been thoroughly cleaned after the murders. What little blood was found led to Charles Rogers' bedroom. There, police found a bloodstained keyhole saw but no trace of Rogers himself. A search for Rogers was launched and a warrant was issued for him as a material witness to the crime, but he was never found. Allegations of involvement in the assassination of JFK Rogers' life was documented in the 1992 book The Man on the Grassy Knoll by John R. Craig and Philip A. Rogers. According to this work, Rogers was a CIA agent who likely impersonated Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City and, along with Charles Harrelson, was one of two shooters involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. The authors allege that Rogers, Harrelson, and Chauncey Holt were the \\"three tramps\\" arrested in Dealey Plaza after the assassination and that Rogers murdered his parents because his mother was tracking his many telephone calls. In this account, Rogers fled to Guatemala. Publishers Weekly reviewed the book stating: \\"The authors do a workmanlike job with their thesis, but the degree of poetic license, in terms of reconstructed dialogue and attributed thought, seems excessive here, and sourcing is virtually nonexistent. Assassination buffs, however, will welcome the book for its novelty value and its easy readability.\\" Aftermath In 1975, a Houston judge declared Rogers legally dead so his estate could be probated. The case still remains officially unsolved and Rogers remains the only suspect. Houston forensic accountant Hugh Gardenier and his wife Martha have continued to investigate the case and concluded that Rogers did murder his parents and was later killed in Honduras. While they have dismissed John R. Craig and Philip A. Rogers's claim that Rogers was a CIA operative due to a lack of evidence, they admit that Rogers did have dealings with contract workers for the CIA when he worked as a seismologist. The Gardeniers believe that Rogers planned the murder of his parents for years because his father was abusive and both parents were \\"devious con artists\\". According to them, Fred Rogers worked as a bookie who regularly engaged in illegal activities such as gambling and fraud. They believe he continued abusing Charles into adulthood and began stealing large sums of money from him. After killing and dismembering his parents, the Gardeniers say that Rogers fled the U.S. for Mexico and was never found because he was aided by \\"powerful friends\\" he met through his ham radio hobby and while working for various oil and mining companies. They have theorized that Rogers eventually made his way to Honduras where he was killed over a wage dispute with miners. In October 2003, Redbud Publishing released The Ice Box Murders, a novel written by Hugh and Martha Gardenier. According to a review in the Houston Press: \\"The Ice Box Murders is written as fact-based fiction and supposition. There are many unnamed characters in the book: various politicians and attorneys as well as the eyewitness who said he saw Rogers in Honduras after 1965.\\" Publishers Weekly also referred to the novel as \\"fact-based fiction\\". The house in which the murders took place was located at 1815 Driscoll Street. After the murders, the house remained empty and unsold. It was torn down in 1972. The lot remained empty until 2000 when condominiums were built on the lot. In popular culture Rogers is featured in two novels by James Ellroy: American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand. The murder case involving Rogers, as well as Hugh and Martha Gardenier looking into the case, is the subject of Episode 41 of the Criminal podcast, titled \\"Open Case\\".

The dose levels are prepared by dilution in a diluent that is inert in respect of the response. The experimental units can for example be cell- cultures, tissues, organs or living animals. The biological response may be quantal (e.g. positive/negative) or quantitative (e.g. growth). The goal is to relate the response to the dose, usually by interpolation techniques, and in many cases to express the potency/activity of the test preparation(s) relative to a standard of known potency/activity. Dilution assays can be direct or indirect. In a direct dilution assay the amount of dose needed to produce a specific (fixed) response is measured, so that the dose is a stochastic variable defining the tolerance distribution. Conversely, in an indirect dilution assay the dose levels are administered at fixed dose levels, so that the response is a stochastic variable. Statistical models For a mathematical definition of a dilution assay an observation space U is defined and a function f:U\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R} so that the responses u\\\\in U are mapped to the set of real numbers. It is now assumed that a function F exists which relates the dose z\\\\in[0,\\\\infty) to the response :f(u)=F(z)+e in which e is an error term with expectation 0. F is usually assumed to be continuous and monotone. In situations where a standard preparation is included it is furthermore assumed that the test preparation T behaves like a dilution (or concentration) of the standard S :F_{T}(z)=F_{S}(\\\\rho z), for all z where \\\\rho>0 is the relative potency of T. This is the fundamental assumption of similarity of dose-response curves which is necessary for a meaningful and unambiguous definition of the relative potency. In many cases it is convenient to apply a power transformation x=z^{\\\\lambda} with \\\\lambda>0 or a logarithmic transformation x=\\\\log (z). The latter can be shown to be a limit case of \\\\lambda\\\\downarrow0 so if \\\\lambda=0 is written for the log transformation the above equation can be redefined as :F_{T}(x)=F_{S}(\\\\rho^{\\\\lambda}x), for all x. Estimates \\\\hat F of F are usually restricted to be member of a well-defined parametric family of functions, for example the family of linear functions characterized by an intercept and a slope. Statistical techniques such as optimization by Maximum Likelihood can be used to calculate estimates of the parameters. Of notable importance in this respect is the theory of Generalized Linear Models with which a wide range of dilution assays can be modelled. Estimates of F may describe F satisfactorily over the range of doses tested, but they do not necessarily have to describe F beyond that range. However, this does not mean that dissimilar curves can be restricted to an interval where they happen to be similar. In practice, F itself is rarely of interest. More of interest is an estimate of \\\\rho or an estimate of the dose that induces a specific response. These estimates involve taking ratios of statistically dependent parameter estimates. Fieller's theorem can be used to compute confidence intervals of these ratios. Some special cases deserve particular mention because of their widespread use: If F is linear and \\\\lambda>0 this is known as a slope-ratio model. If F is linear and \\\\lambda=0 this is known as a parallel line model. Another commonly applied model is the probit model where F is the cumulative normal distribution function, \\\\lambda=0 and e follows a binomial distribution. Example: Microbiological assay of antibiotics Parallel line assay An antibiotic standard (shown in red) and test preparation (shown in blue) are applied at three dose levels to sensitive microorganisms on a layer of agar in petri dishes. The stronger the dose the larger the zone of inhibition of growth of the microorganisms. The biological response u is in this case the zone of inhibition and the diameter of this zone f(u) can be used as the measurable response. The doses z are transformed to logarithms x=\\\\log (z) and the method of least squares is used to fit two parallel lines to the data. The horizontal distance \\\\log (\\\\hat\\\\rho) between the two lines (shown in green) serves as an estimate of the potency \\\\rho of the test preparation relative to the standard. Software The major statistical software packages do not cover dilution assays although a statistician should not have difficulties to write suitable scripts or macros to that end. Several special purpose software packages for dilution assays exist. References * Finney, D.J. (1971). Probit Analysis, 3rd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. * Finney, D.J. (1978).

If the rim of the glass has been salted, the drink is instead called a salty dog. History The earliest known mention of a cocktail of this description is in bartender and author Harry Craddock's Savoy Cocktail Book of 1930. Craddock describes his recipe as \\"...a variation of the Grapefruit Cocktail\\", suggesting that such cocktails were already in common use before his book was written. His recipe consists of nothing but gin, grapefruit juice and ice. A recipe for a similar cocktail with the name \\"Greyhound\\" appears in Harper's magazine in 1945 (volume 191, page 461) thus: \\"The cocktails were made of vodka, sugar, and canned grapefruit juice -- a greyhound. This cocktail was served at Greyhound's popular restaurant chain that was located at bus terminals, called 'Post House'.\\" Before 1945, vodka was an uncommon spirit and most drinks we think of today as \\"classic cocktails\\" and which call for vodka, originally would have contained gin. As vodka's popularity grew after the War and gin's popularity waned, many of the popular cocktails persisted, albeit with vodka substituted for gin. The most conspicuous of these is the Martini which, before 1945, would invariably have been made with gin. The reason that most cocktails during and just after prohibition were prepared with salted or sugared rims is because the quality of adult beverages was not so appealing. Also, more currently, both the greyhounds and the salty dogs are more often ordered / made with vodkas not gins. The root cause of this is for taste preferences and to serve a broader market.Partner (2000-Present) \\"The Line Steak and Brew\\" Boston (Everett), MA, USA Garnish For the greyhound, twist of lime or lemon.

The first Spanish horses arrived in Australia in 1972 and were brought to the El Caballo Blanco complex at Wooroloo, by the Western Australian business entrepreneur, Ray Williams. Williams imported the well known stallion Bodeguero and a number of mares, as the foundation of the Bodeguero Stud. Many of the present day Andalusian horses in Australia trace back to Bodeguero and those first mares. El Caballo Resort was established in 1974 at Wooroloo and their dancing horses were a popular tourist attraction. Theme parks Williams established the El Caballo Blanco theme park at Catherine Field near the Sydney suburb of Narellan. Its main attraction was its Andalusian dancing stallions, but the park also featured miniature Fallabella horses, and a number of non-equestrian related amusements such as water slides, train rides, and a small wildlife zoo. Williams then went on to establish an El Caballo Blanco park at Disneyland in the US. After Williams' death in the US, the operations of the various El Caballo Blanco theme parks gradually wound down and ceased. For many years after the closure of the Catherine Field complex, it was used for storing items such as carpets, until a fire engulfed much of the building housing the main show arena. The Andalusian horses remained on the site, cared for by a group of horse enthusiasts. After quite some years, the Wooroloo complex in Western Australia once again hosting the famed Spanish dancing horse show. In June 2007 a new (independent) El Caballo Blanco show paying tribute to the Spanish dancing horses re-opened playing regular shows at Horseworld Stadium, located at Maraylya in Sydney's north-west. This new show was put together by Rene Gasser. In September 2007, equine influenza impacted Gasser's El Caballo Blanco show. Three horses showed clinical signs of the disease resulting in the suspension of his shows. These horses can still be seen at Wooroloo in Western Australia.

Design and development The Eagle 150B is a development of the Eagle X-TS from Western Australian inventors Neil GrahamNeil Graham Profile and his father Deryck Graham. Australian aeronautical engineer Graham Swannell and American aerodynamicist John Roncz were then engaged to design an aircraft to meet then-current JAR VLA requirements and demonstrate minimal stall characteristics. The resulting prototype (designated Eagle 150A) was first flown in March 1988, and was certified in November 1996. The aircraft demonstrated docile stall characteristics, rapid roll rates, 125 knot cruise speed (at 75% power) and crisp handling. After 15 aircraft were built at Fremantle, Western Australia, the Eagle 150B was introduced. Roncz was presented with the Prince's Australian Medal for the design of the Eagle 150 by His Royal Highness Prince Philip at a London ceremony in 2000.John Roncz The Medium The manufacturing rights to the Eagle 150B are now owned by the Malaysian company Composites Technology Research Malaysia (CTRM).

He hit three home runs, had 23 RBIs, in 95 games played. After the 1955 season, he was traded from the Tigers to the Chicago White Sox for Virgil Trucks. =Chicago White Sox (1956-1959)= In , Phillips spent his first season on the White Sox team like Detroit, mostly a bench player. He was used sometimes as a pinch hitter, an outfield defensive replacement, and a one time as a third baseman. He hit .273 with 2 home runs, and 11 RBIs, in 67 games played. In , Phillips became the White Sox starting third baseman. He hit .270 with 7 home runs, and 42 RBIs, in 121 games. He took the starting job at 3rd base from Fred Hatfield who hit .202 that year. In , Phillips spent time almost evenly at third base and in the outfield, playing 10 more games at third base than in the outfield. He hit .273 with five home runs, and 30 RBIs, in 84 games. Unfortunately, on June 8, he broke his right foot for six weeks tripping over first base and was replaced by utility player, Billy Goodman. Phillips was a consistent hitter who did not walk much but did not strike out much either. In , Phillips reclaimed his starting job at third base from Goodman (74 games at third base) playing 100 games at third and 23 games in the outfield, helping the White Sox win the American League Pennant championship. Phillips hit .264 with 5 home runs, 40 RBIs, 27 doubles, and 27 walks, in 117 games. He also did well in the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, hitting .300 in 10 at-bats. After the 1959 season, Phillips was traded to the Cleveland Indians with Norm Cash and Johnny Romano for Minnie Mi√±oso, Dick Brown, Don Ferrarese, and Jake Striker. The White Sox also acquired Gene Freese from the National League's (NL) Philadelphia Phillies for their third base position in exchange for outfielder Johnny Callison. =Cleveland Indians (1960-1962)= In , Phillips batted only .207 with 4 home runs. He ended up having to relinquish time at third to Ken Aspromonte and other players. In , Phillips rebounded, finding a power stroke that led him to hit 18 home runs, including the only two grand slam's of his career. He finished the season hitting .264 with 72 RBIs. Manager Jimmy Dykes even tried for a time him as the Indians' cleanup hitter. He led the American League with 188 putouts as third baseman. In , Phillips was not as successful as he was 1961. He hit .258 with 10 home runs, and 54 RBIs. He was part of a rare back- to-back-to-back home run feat, in which he, Jerry Kindall, and Jim Mahoney all connected home runs in succession off pitcher Bill Stafford on June 17. After the 1962 season, Phillips was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitchers Ron Nischwitz and Gordon Seyfried. Cleveland was making room for rookie third baseman, Max Alvis. =Detroit Tigers (1963-1964)= In , Phillips was the Tigers starting third baseman, he hit .246 with 5 home runs. He had a career high of 6 stolen bases and led the American League with 10 sacrifice flies. In , Phillips lost his starting job to a young Don Wert. Phillips hit .253 with 3 home runs and 6 RBIs. He finished his major league baseball career on September 18 as a pinch-runner in the ninth inning in a game against the Indians. =Summary= Phillips had a .255 lifetime batting average with 62 home runs and 356 RBIs. He had a .964 fielding average. He walked 182 times and struck out only 314 times in 3,278 at-bats. He collected his final major league hit off Gerry Arrigo and his final home run off Dave Stenhouse. According to Baseball-Reference, the player he is most similar to statistically is Mike Shannon. He was teammates with Barry Latman for 6 seasons, longer than any other teammate. He mostly wore number #5 during his career, although during part of the 1960 season he wore #7, and during his final two years at Clevland he wore #1. Post baseball Phillips worked in real estate and was a tennis instructor at the University of Southern Mississippi and the city of Hattiesburg. In 1972, he was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame. In 1981, Phillips played \\"Coach Hardy\\" in the TV film, Don't Look Back: The Story of Leroy 'Satchel' Paige, which starred Louis Gossett Jr. as legendary pitcher Satchel Paige.

It is situated on the site of an Old Saxon hillfort and refuge castle, the Eresburg, on a hill 130m above the Diemel river, a tributary of the River Weser. History The location was originally the site of an Iron Age hillfort, founded probably sometime before or during the era of the Roman-Germanic wars; including the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (circa AD 9) and the Battle of the Weser River (circa AD 16). Although it is unclear whether the surrounding area was controlled by the Cherusci, Chatti, or perhaps Marsi (as described by Tacitus), no particular reference to the Eresburg is known prior to the Saxon Wars (AD 770‚Äì785). Nikolai Church During the Saxon Wars, the stronghold was repeatedly occupied by Widukind, leader of the recalcitrant Saxons (those refusing to adopt Christianity and the overlordship of the Franks), and then abandoned to Charlemagne's forces as the Saxons retreated to the home of Widukind's in-laws, today Denmark. Local lore states that as Charlemagne's forces approached, the town's common folk would move into the Drachenholler, a vast system of underground gypsum caves beneath Eresburg, where they remained unnoticed until Charlemagne's people left. Though only a legend, the caves can still be seen, along with several watchtowers dated to the same time period (circa AD 800). =Religion= Very near Eresburg is Priesterberg, a hill overlooking the valley of the Diemel. This was reportedly the location of Pagan sacrificial rites in the pre-Christian era. It is also thought to be the home of Irminsul, a sacred tree or pillar which represented the Germanic central pillar of the world. In AD 772, Charlemagne destroyed the Irminsul on Priesterberg (elsewhere reported as \\"near Paderborn\\" or \\"near Eresburg\\"). The Irminsul was replaced by a stone structure, possibly a tower, the crumbling remains of which can still be seen. Around AD 800 the first Christian church was constructed in Eresburg proper. Although the current church in Obermarsberg only dates to the 13th century, it is at least the second or third church to be built over the remains of Charlemagne's original church.

Either it or a close relative has been introduced to Kyoto Prefecture in Japan and to Taiwan. It is considered critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, pollution, and overcollection, as it is considered a delicacy and used in traditional Chinese medicine. On farms in central China, it is extensively farmed and sometimes bred, although many of the salamanders on the farms are caught in the wild. It has been listed as one of the top-10 \\"focal species\\" in 2008 by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered project. The Chinese giant salamander is considered to be a \\"living fossil\\". Although protected under Chinese law and CITES Appendix I, the wild population has declined by more than an estimated 80% since the 1950s. Although traditionally recognized as one of two living species of Andrias salamander in Asia, the other being the Japanese giant salamander, evidence indicates that the Chinese giant salamander may be composed of at least five cryptic species, further compounding each individual species' endangerment.  Taxonomy  The correct scientific name of this species has been argued to be Andrias scheuchzeri (in which case Andrias davidianus would be a junior synonym) ‚Äì a name otherwise restricted to an extinct species described from Swiss fossils.Amphibian Species of the World 5.2. Genus Andrias. Retrieved 2008-12-28. It has also been given the moniker of \\"living fossil\\" for being part of the family Cryptobranchidae which dates back 170 million years. It is one of only four to five known extant species of the family, the others being the slightly smaller, but otherwise very similar Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus), the slightly larger South China giant salamander (A. sligoi), an undescribed species from eastern China, and the far smaller North American hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis).Browne, R.K.; Li, H.; Wang, Z.; Okada, S.; Hime, P.; McMillan, A.; Wu, M.; Diaz, R.; McGinnity, D.; & Briggler, J.T. (2014). The giant salamanders (Cryptobranchidae): Part B. Biogeography, ecology and reproduction. Amphibian and Reptile Conservation 5(4): 30‚Äì50. A 2018 study of mitochondrial DNA revealed that there are five wild clades of the Chinese giant salamander, as well as two only known from captives (their possible wild range is unknown). They diverged from each other 4.71‚Äì10.25 million years ago and should possibly be recognized as cryptic species. Despite this deep divergence, they can hybridize among each other, and also with the Japanese giant salamander. One of these clades was identified in 2019 as Andrias sligoi, a species described in 1924 by Edward George Boulenger and later synonymized with A. davidianus, with the study supporting its revival as a distinct taxon. Another as-of-yet undescribed species was also identified that formerly inhabited rivers originating from the Huangshan mountains in eastern China.  Description  It has a large head, small eyes, and dark, wrinkly skin. Its flat, broad head has a wide mouth, round, lidless eyes, and a line of paired tubercles that run around its head and throat. Its color is typically dark brown with a mottled or speckled pattern, but it can also be other brownish tones, dark reddish, or black. Albinos, which are white or orange, have been recorded.Sparreboom, M.; & Wu, Y. (2014). Andrias davidianus (Blanchard, 1871). Salamanders of China. Retrieved 23 February 2016. All species of giant salamanders produce a sticky, white skin secretion that repels predators. The average adult salamander weighs and is in length.Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc. (1983), It can reach up to in weight and in length, making it the largest amphibian species.\\"Chinese Giant Salamander Conservation\\". Chinese Giant Salamander Conservation. N.p., 2014. Web. 23 Oct. 2014. The longest recently documented Chinese giant salamander, kept at a farm in Zhangjiajie, was in 2007. At , both this individual, and a long, individual found in a remote cave in Chongqing in December 2015, surpassed the species' typically reported maximum weight. The giant salamander is known to vocalize, making barking, whining, hissing, or crying sounds. Some of these vocalizations bear a striking resemblance to the crying of a young human child, and as such, it is known in the Chinese language as the \\"infant fish\\" (Â®ÉÂ®ÉÈ±º / È≤µ).  Behavior  = Feeding = The Chinese giant salamander has been recorded feeding on insects, millipedes, horsehair worms, amphibians (both frogs and salamanders), freshwater crabs, shrimp, fish (such as Saurogobio and Cobitis) and Asiatic water shrew. Presumably ingested by mistake, plant material and gravel have also been found in their stomachs. Cannibalism is frequent; in a study of 79 specimens from the Qinling‚ÄìDabashan range, the stomach content of five included remains of other Chinese giant salamanders and this made up 28% of the combined weight of all food items in the study. The most frequent items in the same study were freshwater crabs (found in 19 specimens), which made up 23% of the combined weight of all food items. It has very poor eyesight, so it depends on special sensory nodes that run in a line on the body from head to tail. It is capable of sensing the slightest vibrations around it with the help of these nodes. Based on a captive study, most activity is from the earlier evening to the early night. Most individuals stop feeding at water temperatures above and feeding ceases almost entirely at . Temperatures of are lethal to Chinese giant salamanders. = Breeding and lifecycle = A 30-year-old animal in a German zoo Both sexes maintain a territory, averaging for males and for females. The reproductive cycle is initiated when the water temperature reaches and mating occurs between July and September. The female lays 400‚Äì500 eggs in an underwater breeding cavity, which is guarded by the male until the eggs hatch after 50‚Äì60 days. When laid, the eggs measure in diameter, but they increase to about double that size by absorbing water. When hatching, the larvae are about long and external gills remain until a length of about at an age of 3 years. Maturity is reached at an age of 5 to 6 years and a length of . The maximum age reached by Chinese giant salamanders is unknown, but it is at least 60 years based on captive individuals. Undocumented claims have been made of 200-year-old Chinese giant salamanders, but these are considered unreliable.Bittel, J. (16 December 2015). This Giant Salamander Isn't 200 Years Old, But It's Still Super Rare. National Geographic.  Distribution and habitat  The Chinese giant salamander species complex comprises five clades, with multiple possibly worthy of species recognition. Their native ranges differ, but release of Chinese giant salamanders from captivity has complicated this picture. They were widespread in central, south-western and southern China, although their range is now highly fragmented. Their range spans the area from Qinghai east to Jiangsu and south to Sichuan, Guangxi and Guangdong; notably in the basins of the Yangtze, Yellow and Pearl Rivers. One is from the Pearl River basin (at least in Guangxi), two from the Yellow River basin, one from the Yangtze River basin (at least in Chongqing and Guizhou) and the final from the Qiantang River (at least in Anhui). Two additional clades are only known from captivity (their wild range is unknown) and no samples are available for the population in the Tibetan Plateau. A 2019 study has identified that the Yangtze River clade comprises the \\"true\\" A. davidianus, the Pearl River clade comprises A. sligoi, and the Qiantang clade comprises the undescribed Huangshan Mountains species. Finds in Taiwan may be the result of introduction. Chinese giant salamanders have been introduced to the Kyoto Prefecture in Japan where they present a threat to the native Japanese giant salamander, as the two hybridize. The Chinese giant salamander is entirely aquatic and lives in rocky hill streams and lakes with clear water. It typically lives in dark muddy or rocky crevices along the banks. It is usually found in forested regions at altitudes of , with most records between . There is an isolated population at an altitude of in Qinghai (Tibetan Plateau), but its taxonomic position is uncertain and the site likely does not support giant salamanders anymore due to pollution. The salamanders prefer to live in streams of small width (on average, across), quick flow, and little depth (on average, deep). Water temperature varies depending on season, with typical range at low elevation sites being from and at high elevation sites from . Although they prefer to have quick flow in the stream, the burrows in which they lay their eggs often have much slower flow. Furthermore, their habitat often possesses very rocky, irregular stream beds with a lot of gravel and small rocks as well as some vegetation. Chinese giant salamanders are also known from subterranean rivers. As populations in aboveground rivers and lakes are more vulnerable to poaching, there are some parts of China where only the subterranean populations remain.Dai, Q.; Wang, Y.; and Liang, G. (2010). Conservation status of Chinese Giant Salamander (Andrias davidianus). Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.  In captivity  = Farming = Very large numbers are being farmed in China, but most of the breeding stock are either wild-caught or first-generation captive-bred.Salisbury, C. (13 November 2015). Chinese Giant Salamander: millions farmed, nearly extinct in the wild. Mongabay. Retrieved 22 February 2016. This is partially explained by the fact that the industry is relatively new, but some farms have also struggled to produce second-generation captive-bred offspring. Registrations showed that 2.6 million Chinese giant salamanders were kept in farms in 2011 in Shaanxi alone, far surpassing the entire countrywide wild population estimated at less than 50,000 individuals. Shaanxi farms (mainly in the Qinling Mountain region) accounted for about 70% of the total output in China in 2012, but there are also many farms in Guizhou and several in other provinces. Among 43 south Shaanxi farms surveyed, 38 bred the species in 2010 and each produced an average of c. 10,300 larvae that year. Farming of Chinese giant salamanders, herbs and mushrooms are the three most important economic activities in Shaanxi's Qinling Mountain region, and many thousands of families rely on the giant salamander farms for income. The giant salamander farming mainly supplies the food market, but whether this can be achieved to an extent where the pressure on the wild populations is reduced is doubtful. Release of captive-bred Chinese giant salamanders is supported by the government (8,000 were released in Shaanxi in 2011 alone), but represent a potential risk to the remaining wild population, as diseases such as Ranavirus are known from many farms. The vast majority of the farmed Chinese giant salamanders, almost 80% based on a study published in 2018, are of Yellow River origin (the so-called haplotype B), although those from other regions also occur. Farms have generally not considered this issue when releasing giant salamanders and Yellow River animals now dominate in some regions outside their original range, further endangering the native types. Additionally, release of untreated wastewater from farms may spread diseases to wild Chinese giant salamanders. = In zoos and aquariums = As of early 2008, Species360 records show only five individuals held in US zoos (Zoo Atlanta, Cincinnati Zoo, and Saint Louis Zoological Park), and an additional four in European zoos (Dresden Zoo and Rotterdam Zoo);Andrias davidianus in zoos. isis.org as well as one in the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe, where it is also the museum's mascot.State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe - terrarium exhibits. smnk.de As of 2019, London Zoo holds four individuals (one of them on display) that were seized from an illegal importation of amphibians in 2016. A medium-sized individual, approximately long, was kept for several years at the Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco, California, and is now on display again in the \\"Water Planet\\" section of the new California Academy of Sciences building. There are also two in residence at the Los Angeles Zoo. Additional individuals are likely kept in non-Species360 zoos and animals parks in its native China, such as Shanghai Zoo. Several of them are kept in the aquaria of Shanghai and Xian. The Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan in Japan has both a Chinese and a Japanese giant salamander on display, as does the Saitama aquarium in Hany≈´, Saitama. Since May 2014, 33 Chinese giant salamanders, including three adults, have been held in Prague Zoo. The main attraction is the largest individual in Europe, which is long.  Decline in population  Chinese giant salamanders for sale in a restaurant in Hongqiao Town (ËôπÊ°•Èïá) in Zhejiang, China for 880 CNY/jin, or about 215 EUR/kg or US$127/lb. Such prices make them an attractive target for poaching. In the past, the Chinese giant salamander was fairly common and widespread in China. Since the 1950s, the population has declined rapidly due to habitat destruction and overhunting. It has been listed as Critically Endangered in the Chinese Red Book of Amphibians and Reptiles. Despite the Chinese Government listing the salamander as a Class II Protected Species, 100 salamanders are hunted illegally every year in the Hupingshan Natural Nature Reserve alone. Since the 1980s, 14 nature reserves have been established as an effort to conserve the species. Despite this, the population continues to decline with the salamanders becoming increasingly difficult to find. In a recent survey of the species in the Qinghai Province, none were found indicating the population size is at a significantly low number or the species is locally extinct in the province. This is believed to be due to the increased mining in the region. In recent years populations have also declined with an epizootic Ranavirus infection. The disease causes severe hemorrhaging in both juveniles and adult salamanders. The virus was named the Chinese giant salamander iridovirus (GSIV). Its natural range has suffered in the past few decades due to habitat loss and overharvesting. Consequently, many salamanders are now farmed in mesocosms across China. Furthermore, previously built concrete dams that destroyed the salamander's habitat are now fitted with stairs so that the animal can easily navigate the dam and make it back to its niche. The Chinese giant salamander is listed as a critically endangered species. It has experienced a drastic population decline, which is estimated to be more than 80% in the last 3 generations due to human causes. Human consumption is the main threat to the Chinese giant salamander. They are considered to be a luxury food item, as well as an important source of traditional medicines in China. They are easy to hunt, so catching them is not a problem. Breeding Chinese giant salamanders is a large industry with thousands of breeding and many enterprises. = Habitat destruction = According to a recent study, 90% of the Chinese giant salamanders' habitat was destroyed by the year 2000, and there are many human-related causes of such massive destruction. Because the salamander dwells in free-flowing streams, industrialization is a large problem for many stream-dwelling species. The construction of dams greatly disturbs their habitat by either causing these streams to dry up or to stand still, thus making it uninhabitable by the salamanders. Siltation also contributes to the degradation of their habitats by soiling the water. Deforestation in areas near the streams can worsen soil erosion and create runoff into the streams as well, which reduces the water quality to a great extent. The reduced water quality makes it much more difficult for the salamanders to absorb oxygen through their skin and can often bring death to those within the species. Water pollution is also a great factor in the habitat destruction of the Chinese giant salamander; the immense decline in their population can be traced to, among the other major problems of over-hunting and failed conservation efforts, the tainting of the water that they live in. Mining activity in particular in areas near their streams often causes runoff that sullies the water, and farming‚Äîand all of the pesticides and chemicals that affect the soil that come with it‚Äîhas a vastly negative effect on the areas near the streams as well. The presence of macronutrients in the streams can also cause algal blooms, which cloud the water and force the temperature to rise. The salamanders reside primarily in very cold underwater cavities and follow a specific nesting requirement, which means that they will only reproduce and care for their eggs in areas such as these, so changes in temperature are incredibly detrimental to their health and well-being as well as to their perpetuation as a species. These algal blooms also deplete the levels of oxygen in the water, and a lesser supply of oxygen can quite easily hold the potential to kill off many members of the dwindling species. Many efforts have been undertaken to create reserves and faux habitats for the Chinese giant salamander so that they can reproduce without worry of soiled water, but many of these reserves have failed in having a great impact overall due to the massive overhunting of the species. No matter how many members of the species they manage to save through the reserves, the poachers still manage to capture and kill that many more. Although habitat destruction is certainly not assisting in the perpetuation of the species, it is certainly not the biggest obstacle that the Chinese giant salamander faces in its quest to avoid extinction. = Climate change = Like other amphibians, the Chinese giant salamander is ectothermic. Most Chinese giant salamanders stop feeding at water temperatures above and feeding ceases almost entirely at . Temperatures of are lethal to Chinese giant salamanders. As a consequence, the species is vulnerable to global warming. = Overhunting = One of the main reasons that the Chinese giant salamander, Andrias davidianus, has been placed on the critically endangered list by the International Union for Conservation of Nature is overhunting. 75% of native species in China are harvested for food. The salamander is also used for traditional medicinal purposes. In 1989, the Chinese government placed legal protection on the salamander (category II due to its population decline by The Wild Animal Protection Law of China and Appendix I in the Convention of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna.). But the salamander populations have continued to decline. The domestic demand for salamander meat and body parts greatly exceeds what can sustainably be harvested from the wild. Commercial captive breeding operations so far still rely on the regular introduction of new wild-caught breeding adults, because captive-bred animals have proven difficult to mate. In addition, salamander farms would need to increase their yield manifold before the black-market price of poached salamander drop significantly, meaning that a stricter enforcement of anti-poaching law is still very much the future for the Chinese giant salamander. China's penalty for illegally hunting these creatures is very low and only comes to 50 yuan, or about US$6, which is less than one hundred times the black-market price. Establishments such as restaurants can charge up to US$250‚ÄìUS$400 per kilogram. A hunting tool known as a bow hook is one of the preferred methods used by hunters to catch the salamander. This hunting tool is made with a combination of bamboo and sharp hooks baited with frogs or smaller fish. This is used to capture the salamander and keep it alive. Some hunters use pesticides to kill the salamander. Farmers often poach wild salamanders to stock their breeding programs, while others are hunted as food. In May 2018, CNET reported that Chinese giant salamanders were being poached and eaten into extinction, after an extensive study found they were nearly extinct in the wild. In the study, the Zoological Society of London and the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China studied sites in 16 provinces over four years. The researchers had been unable to confirm survival of wild salamanders at any of the 97 sites they surveyed. The study also brought up worries that commercial farms and conservation programs were crossbreeding what they described as five distinct species of Chinese giant salamanders. All the wild populations studied were found \\"critically depleted or extirpated\\" by the study. A related study found that some of the five distinct genetic lineages were probably already extinct in the wild.  Conservation efforts  To understand the conservation efforts in China, it is important to know something about the events of the several past hundred years of China's history relating to social attitudes, pressures on nature and natural resources, and the political ambition to safeguard the natural environment. Each of these are significant factors and determinants of conservation efforts. Up until the year 1700, China was a country that was rampant with land reclamations, growing land exploitation, and wars. These series of events led to a huge upsurge in the diminishing of the natural biomass and as well as a reduction in spatial distribution of biotic resources. The significance of this situation was that this drastic dwindling of resources made the people of this region aware of the relationship between utilization and conservation. From 1911 to 1949, China began to move into the direction of modern industry, urbanization, civil wars, and agriculture. This transition period brought with it the depletion and disappearance of various renewable resources, as well as the pollution of various biotopes. This lack of conservation eventually led to a deteriorating environment, which meant lower standards of living for the Chinese population. This is the point when both the government and the people of China came to the epiphany that the environment matters. It was not until 1956 that modern nature conservation efforts begin to develop. The Chinese reforms that preceded this new Chinese perspective on conservation were not only beneficial to the Chinese giant salamander, but all organisms that occupied the natural environment of China. There was a formation of a new administrative system for nature conservation, which came together in the late 1950s. This new structure was able to establish new regulations that aimed at being successful in educating the masses about the value and significance of nature conservation, promoting awareness on the present status of various species, as well as prohibiting anti-conservation efforts such as hunting and trading of protected species such as the Chinese giant salamander. Some examples would be the Environmental Protection Law of 1979, Regulation of Water and Soil Conservation of 1982, Forestry Law of 1985, as well as the Wildlife Conservation Law of 1988. It was during this time period that the Chinese giant salamander was categorized as a category II species. All these species are endangered because their population is declining or their geographic distribution is becoming restricted. In the midst of all these conservation efforts, in the late 1970s, a program network of nature reserves was established in China. These reserves were established to uphold four major principles. * First, is to conserve typical ecosystems and to represent the biotic communities. * Second, the reserves are meant to secure rare, endemic, and valuable species, as well as their habitats or breeding locations. * Third, these reserves were developed to rescue and regenerate deteriorated or damaged natural ecosystems and habitats of special significance. * Finally, the reserves would be created in order to have sanctuaries in areas of special importance, such as seed forests, geological sections, glacial remains, watershed forest, etc. Many of these reservations were created for the overall protection of all endangered species of China and the conservation of the natural world they occupy. A few more reservations were made specifically with the idea of preserving Chinese giant salamander populations. Beginning in the 1980s, there have been more than 14 nature reserves established for the conservation of the Chinese giant salamander, such as the Zhangjiaje Giant Salamander Nature Reserve, Lushi Giant Salamander Nature Reserve, Qingyaoshan Giant Salamander Nature Reserve, Youyang Giant Salamander Nature Reserve, and the Taibai Giant Salamander Nature Reserve. Though many efforts have been put forward, very few regulations have actually been enforced. Due to lack of strong influential regulations and lack of funding, the conservation of the Chinese giant salamander has all but failed. They continue to have major decline in their populations due to human intervention of many different sorts. Even nature reserves continue to see diminution of populations. Many of the reserves suffer from the same issues, such as shortage of funding and personnel, poaching, development of tourism, etc. Few believe that even with the major losses already suffered, the situation can still be turned around through proper protection of the Chinese giant salamander habitats, nesting sites, prevention of pollution from surface runoff, banning of certain hunting methods, and an assessment of irrigation work with nature reserves. Some believe that there also need to be more surveys carried out that institutes the conservation status and demography of the salamander, as well as having a holistic view of the life history of this species. Others say that a public information campaign is needed to better educate local inhabitants. Construction has begun on the largest artificial breeding and protection base for the endangered giant salamander in China. The base in Jing'an County, in the eastern province of Jiangxi, will breed the amphibians for scientific research, the traditional Chinese medicine industry and for exhibition in aquariums. Located in the Sanzhaolun Forest Park, the 10.83 million yuan (1.35 million U.S. dollars) project is intended to breed 60,000 giant salamanders annually when it is completed by the end of next year. The base, covering 10,000 square meters, would boost efforts to save the world's largest amphibian from extinction, said Li Xinfa, head of the Jing'an County Giant Salamander Research Center. The number of wild giant salamanders has declined rapidly due to their value as a source of traditional Chinese medicine ingredients and as food, and due to poaching, loss of habitat and pollution. It has been put on the list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and it is under state protection in China. EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct & Globally Endangered) aims to ensure the future of this salamander by helping to create an environmental education programme encouraging sustainable management of wild populations.

Mythology  There is not much known about Amycus, but he is said to have been involved in the Centauromachy, a battle between the centaurs and the Lapith people; this battle is what the centaurs are best known for. The battle took place during the wedding of the King of the Lapithae, Pirithous, and his wife Hippodamia. Amycus' involvement in this battle is recognized in the Metamorphoses, written by the Roman poet Ovid. In this work, it is noted that Amycus, along with many other centaurs, was invited to and attended the wedding that turned into a bloody battle. The centaurs become drunk on wine and attempted to take Hippodamia, along with other Lapith women, as they pleased. Eurytus, a centaur, could not control himself when the bride, Hippodamia, was presented; he attempted to kidnap and rape her. He inspired all the drunken centaurs to attack and violate the Lapith women. Theseus, a friend of Pirithous, stopped the centaur Eurytus, ultimately killing him resulting in the first blood of the battle. Amycus's role in this battle is of great importance; he was responsible for the first death of one of the Lapith people. Driven with anger due to the death of the loved centaur Eurytus, Amycus smashed the head of innocent Lapith Celadon with a candlestick. Pelates from Pella clubbed him to death using a leg from a maple table, sending Amycus down to the underworld Tartarus. These were the first deaths of the battle between the centaurs and the Lapith people. The Lapiths ultimately defeated the centaurs and drove them from Thessaly to the northwest.

The gardens, famed for its roses,Keen, M. (2018). Ancestral Values. RHS The Garden, (June 143:6), pp.36-41. are the creation of three generations of women gardeners. Started by Heather Muir in the 1920s, continued by Diany Binny from 1950 and now looked after by Anne Chambers and her husband.Thomas, Graham Stuart, 2003, \\"Recollections of Great Gardeners\\" , Frances Lincoln Ltd, p. 190. Kiftsgate Court is now the home of the Chambers family. The Kiftsgate Hundred was the ancient area surrounding Chipping Campden. Today the 'Kiftsgate Hundred' stone, where the elders met to administer justice, stands in Weston Park Wood above Chipping Campden. Included in the Hundred was Mickleton, called Mycclantune, meaning 'big village'. It is a few hundred yards from Hidcote Manor Garden owned by the National Trust.  History  In about 1750 the poet and landscape gardener William Shenstone stayed at Mickleton Manor, and it was he who inspired the planting of the elm avenue which used to run between Kiftsgate Court and Mickleton Manor - now alas, destroyed by Dutch Elm Disease, along with countless other elms between 1972 and 1976. The line of Scotch firs silhouetted against the sky between Kiftsgate and the Warwickshire county boundary was also due to Shenstone's imaginative foresight, as were the lime trees bordering the front drive - although the house had not been thought of then. During the past fifty years most of these enormous trees have fallen. To replace them for future generations a row of six Tilia Petiolaris have been planted. Vista to the swimming pool built during Diany Binny's time at Kiftsgate Kiftsgate Court was built in 1887-91 by Sydney Graves Hamilton who owned the large manor house in Mickleton.Jenkins, Simon, 2003 \\"England's thousand best houses\\", Allen Lane, p. 261. An ancestor of his, Walwyn Graves (1744‚Äì1813), had built a Georgian front with a high portico on to Mickleton Manor, and it was this facade which was moved bodily up to the new site on Glyde Hill to become Kiftsgate Court. A special light railway was constructed up the elm avenue to do this and the records state that it was 'all to be done in the best manner possible and none but the very best material used'. Unfortunately a large Victorian back was built behind the Georgian facade. Mr and Mrs J. B. Muir bought Kiftsgate in 1918 and at this time considerable internal alterations were made. A large ballroom occupying the entire wing on the first floor behind the portico was divided into bedrooms. Miss Hamilton, who owned Mickleton Manor, was said to have told Mrs Muir that the sprung floor of the ballroom was one of the most expensive items in the building of Kiftsgate. In 1954 they moved to the Front Lodge and their eldest daughter Diany Binny and her husband Tony Binny came to live at Kiftsgate. They pulled down three sides of a courtyard containing sixteen rooms which is now the gravelled forecourt used for parking coaches. In 1974 Mrs D. Binny moved to the Front Lodge, where she lived until her death in 2005. Kiftsgate remained empty until 1981 when Diana's eldest daughter Anne and her husband Jonathan undertook major modernisation of the house making their home in the central part and creating a separate flat and tea room. Kiftsgate remains a family home as originally intended by the owner's grandparents.  The Gardens  The garden at Kiftsgate up to 1920 consisted of the paved formal garden in front of the portico, beyond which was a plain grass field with wooded banks. The first thing Mrs J.B. Muir did was to make a lawn with steps leading to it from the formal paved garden, this was quickly followed by taking in what is now the Yellow Border and the Rose Border; the connecting bridge was built and the yew and copper beech hedges planted. Many people would have thought they had achieved enough but in 1930 the steep bank was tackled, and a summer house with steps either side down to the lower garden was built. view towards MickletonThe hard tennis court, now the modern water garden, was made in the 1930s and the yew hedge was planted around it at the same time. During the war the tennis court, which required continual watering and upkeep, was allowed to become derelict and in 1955 there was a wonderful display of seedling roses and Scotch firs growing on it, which Mrs J.B. Muir was very grieved to see go, when it was resurfaced. In making the garden at Kiftsgate there is no doubt that Heather Muir was greatly helped and inspired by her lifelong friend Major Lawrence Johnston, who created the garden next door at Hidcote Manor. Whilst influenced by Hidcote next door, unlike Hidcote it was never formally planned and is considered by Keen (a garden designer) to be \\"a prettier, less organised place\\". The flower picture in the tea-room at Hidcote was painted directly on the wall at Kiftsgate by Major Johnson and moved to Hidcote in 1981 by the National Trust. Kiftsgate first became well known to the gardening public after Graham Stuart Thomas's article in the Royal Horticultural Society Journal, May 1951, in which the great plantsman observed, \\"I regard this as the finest piece of skilled colour work that it has been my pleasure to see.\\" In April 1954 the magazine Gardening had an illustration of the Yellow Border on its cover and inside an article by A.G.L. Hellyer, reporting that > Each rose bush has grown to its maximum proportions and to the conventional > gardener these proportions will come as a revelation.

Kiftsgate rose Rosa filipesThe gardens are well known for the famous Kiftsgate rose, a scented climbing rose, which is shade-tolerant and very vigorous. It is claimed that the Rosa filipes 'Kiftsgate' is the largest rose in Britain measuring x 90 feet x high at last measurement, as reported on the Kiftsgate website. It was planted in 1938 and named by Graham Stuart Thomas in 1951. The same official website says that it would be even larger were it not cut back, and the owners fear for the integrity of the beech tree which it has colonised owing to the weight of its foliage.

It was built in the 11th century and destroyed in 1215.  History  The castle was located on the north-west side of the present town of Kington above the Back Brook, in Castle Hill. Around the end of the 11th century William Rufus granted the estates in and around Kington to Adam Port and it is likely that he built the first castle here. One of his descendants, also called Adam Port, was in dispute with Henry II and as a consequence of this the castle was forfeited to the crown. In the late 12th century, William Braose held the castle for many years in his capacity as High Sheriff of Herefordshire. In 1201, King John granted the castle and barony to him as his favourite Marcher Baron. However, another dispute arose, and the castle returned to the crown again, later to be granted to King John's supporter Roger Clifford in 1213. In 1215, members of the de Braose family attacked the castle, and in an act of vengeance, King John destroyed it. No further fortifications have been made on the same site.

Like all species in this genus it has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate host are birds.  Description  This species was first described in 2007 by Valkiunas et al. Valkiunas G, Zehtindjiev P, Hellgren O, Ilieva M, Iezhova TA, Bensch S. (2007) Linkage between mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages and morphospecies of two avian malaria parasites, with a description of Plasmodium (Novyella) ashfordi sp. nov. Parasitol Res. The parasite infects erythrocytes. The influence of trophozoites on the morphology of infected erythrocytes is not marked. The parasite nucleus is small, usually terminal in position or with chromatin concentrated along the outer periphery of trophozoites. One or two small (<1 ¬µm in diameter) vacuoles are frequently present in the cytoplasm. Ring forms are not characteristic. The trophozoites are usually found in mature erythrocytes but may be seen in polychromatic erythrocytes during heavy infections. They are variable in shape, usually irregular in outline. Outgrowths extending beyond the main body of the trophozoites are absent. Fully grown trophozoites usually possess one or two minute brown pigment granules which are usually terminal in position and located close to each other. The meronts are fan-like and contain 7 - 8 merozoites (range: 4 - 10). They measure ~5.0 micrometres (range:3.3-6.2) in length, 2.2 micrometres in width (range: 1.7-3.1) and 9.4 square micrometres (range: 5.4-12.2) in area. The pigment granules occupy 0.8-1.3 square micrometres in area. Fully grown gametocytes occupy positions lateral to the nuclei of infected erythrocytes. They are elongated in form and irregular in outline from the earliest stages of their development. The influence of gametocytes on the morphology of infected erythrocytes usually is not pronounced, but nuclei of some infected erythrocytes may be slightly displaced laterally. The parasite nucleus is diffuse and its boundaries are difficult to discern. The chromatin may be positioned anywhere in the gametocyte, which is a rare feature for macrogametocytes of avian hemosporidians. Pigment granules are roundish or oval in form, clumped together into a prominent group usually located terminally or occasionally subterminally. Because of this clumping, the number of pigment granules and their size are difficult to determine. Macrogametocytes are found only in mature erythrocytes even during heavy parasitemia. They measure 9.7 micrometres (range: 7.1 - 12.3) long, 2.3 micrometres (range: 1.9 - 2.8) in width and 21.2 (range: 13.1 - 30.6) square micrometres in area. The cytoplasm is coarsely granular in appearance and usually lacks vacuoles. The microgametocyte are 9.7 micrometres (range: 7.6 - 12.0) long, 2.2 micrometres (range: 1.6 - 2.6) in width and 19.8 (range: 13.5 - 25.1) square micrometres in area. Compared with the macrogametocytes, their nuclei are relatively compact - a rare feature for avian hemosporidians. The nuclei are located centrally or subcentrally.  Geographical location  This species is found in Europe and probably in Africa.  Clinical features and pathological effects  The organism was isolated from great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus).

It was set in the universe of their popular Warhammer 40,000 miniatures game. Plot The game takes place in a Dark Eldar gladiator arena. Each player takes controls of one unit (known as a Wych), and pits it against the opponent's Wyches. Games could be linked into Campaigns over the course of which players could acquire a team of Wyches. Game Pieces The game came with its own playmat, cardboard cut-outs of the Wyches, and cardboard obstacles resembling large piles of jagged metal referred to as 'Murder Stakes'. Dice had to be supplied by the players. The playmat consisted of numerous hexagonal spaces, some already occupied by Murder Stakes, statistics for each Wych were located at either end of the mat. Overview The game would start with each player taking turns placing Murder Stakes around the playmat. Players would then randomly select a Wych and place it at the edge of the board. Each Wych had a certain number of action points which could be spent to move the Wych across the playmat, or engage in combat with other players' Wyches. Combat was resolved by means of dice rolling, and then comparing the results to the attacks listed for their particular Wych. Players could choose from 6 different Wyches, each with unique statistics and attacks.

In 1931 the parish had a population of 728. History Great Leighs is the location of arguably the oldest Inn in England. The Castle was called the St. Anne's Castle until its temporary closure for refurbishment at Easter 2015. It was on the junction of Main Road and Boreham Road. Another Pub, the Dog & Partridge, is at the other end of the village, on Main Road. The full history of The Castle has been lost. However, it is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and claims to be the oldest licensed premises in England, as it served ale to the pilgrims travelling to Thomas Becket's tomb in the 12th Century. It has been an alehouse since the Middle Ages although at some point it was an hermitage. The current state of the exterior is due to a fire over a hundred years ago which destroyed the original thatched roof, which was replaced with tiles. Inside, timbers date back hundreds of years. Down in the cellars are remains of tunnels, which reputedly linked the inn with the nearby Leez Priory, and Great Leigh's church. At The Castle, various references can be read on the walls that tell more of the history. Local folklore also tells that the inn is haunted by the troubled spirit of a witch burned at the stake and buried beneath a stone at the nearby crossroads. In December 2009, a ¬£730,000 project to renovate the Village Hall was completed. It was aided by money associated with a new housing development within the village, extensive fund raising and help from funding bodies and Essex County Council. The incumbent priest during the First World War, Andrew Clark, kept a voluminous diary of the war detailing activities, opinions and rumours in the village and nearby. An edited version of the diary was published in 1985 under the title Echoes of the Great War. In the 2014 BBC series Britain's Great War Jeremy Paxman visits St Mary's Church, Great Leighs, and he describes the early loss of Captain Alan Tritton and brothers Privates Richard (Dick) and Arthur Fitch. He speaks with their niece, Valerie Frost. There is a spring by the side of the road at Cole Hill on Boreham Road, near Great Leighs Church. It once had a lion's head over the outlet. Spring on Cole Hill Racecourse In 2008, Great Leighs became home to the first new racecourse in 80 years, when the nearby Essex County Showground was converted into a state-of-the-art horse-racing venue. Great Leighs Racecourse held its first race meeting on 20 April 2008 and staged its first meeting fully open to the public from 28 to 29 May 2008. However, the course had its temporary licence revoked on 16 January 2009 and did not see racing again until 11 January 2015.

Despite being founded by David Ben- Gurion, one of the fathers of the Israeli left, the party is one of the ancestors of the modern-day Likud, Israel's largest right-wing bloc. Background The National List had been formed by Ben-Gurion prior to the 1969 elections after his former party, Rafi, had merged into the Alignment against his wishes. The new party won four seats in the seventh Knesset, and Ben Gurion was joined in the Knesset by Meir Avizohar, Isser Harel and Yigal Hurvitz. During the session Avizohar defected to the Alignment, leaving the party with three seats. Ben-Gurion resigned from the Knesset in 1970, and was replaced by Zalman Shoval. Without Ben Gurion's leadership, the party began to disintegrate. Before the 1973 elections it joined the Likud alliance formed by Herut, the Liberal Party (which had formerly been allied as Gahal), Free Centre and the Movement for Greater Israel. The new alliance won 39 seats, with Hurvitz and Shoval being elected to the Knesset on its list. In 1976 the National List merged with the Movement for Greater Israel and the Independent Centre (a breakaway from the Free Centre) to form the La'am faction within Likud, and ceased to exist as an independent entity. =Reformation= The party was briefly reformed during the ninth Knesset after Hurvitz, Shoval and Yitzhak Peretz had left Likud to create Rafi ‚Äì National List on 26 January 1981. On 19 May Shoval and Hurvitz left to establish Telem with Moshe Dayan, whilst Peretz renamed the party Rafi, before rejoining Likud on 27 May. Peretz then broke away from the other two to recreate the National List. However, the reconstituted party only lasted for 12 days as Peretz rejoined Likud. In 1983 Hurvitz broke away from Telem to establish Rafi ‚Äì National List, which he later renamed Ometz.

The park operated from 1957 through 1988, and its proximity to the Pocono Mountains made it a popular summer attraction in Northeastern Pennsylvania for thirty years. It was owned and operated as part of the Barletta Family enterprises until 1985. Then it was sold to Mirth Master Corp. of Chester County, PA, who operated the park until 1988. After the 1988 season, the ownership filed for bankruptcy. In 1990, the rides and equipment were auctioned off. During the late 1990s, many of the buildings were razed. During the 2000s, the former park served as a training field for Lackawanna College training program for Lackawanna County policemen. Today, the property is owned by New Land Development of Lackawanna County and is undeveloped. 1950s The idea of an amusement park at this location originated with Angeline Barletta (1896‚Äì1952), the matriarch of the Barletta Family who had immigrated to Hazleton, Pennsylvania, from Italy in 1911. Along with her husband Anthony Barletta and their nine children the Barletta Family operated several successful businesses in the Hazleton Region. During the 1940s the family purchased several hundred acres of land along the Nescopeck Creek in the Butler Valley, part of which was developed into a grove for the family to spend weekend getaways. Angeline often spoke of how one day she envisioned part of the land being developed into an amusement park or recreational facility. After she died unexpectedly in 1952 her family was determined to make her dream a reality. Planning and construction took place during 1955 and 1956 and by the spring of 1957 Angela Park, named in honor of Angeline, was ready to open. The original owners were husband Anthony Barletta, sons Frank, Rocco, James, Joseph, Maurice, John and Fred, and their brother-in-law John DePierro. With the exception of their father Anthony who died in 1960, this partnership would remain intact until 1985. Angela Park was one of several businesses owned and operated by the Barletta family during this time. The seven brothers also have partnerships in A. Barletta and Sons, a heavy construction company that manufactured sand, gravel, asphalt and concrete, Barletta Heating Oil and Edgewood In The Pines Golf Course and Restaurant. Angela Park opened on Mother's Day, May 12, 1957, to a large and enthusiastic crowd. The first year the park had only six rides, four which were designed exclusively for younger children: the Allan Hershel Tank Ride, Boat Ride, Carousel and Airplanes. The other two were the Miniature Train which was a model of the Lehigh Valley Black Diamond and a Roller Coaster. Several cinder block buildings were erected, each exterior painted a different color. The largest of these structures served as the main concession area and had six separate counter areas. The facility included the kitchen, the soft ice cream stand, main ticket window and main office. Directly across from the north end of this structure was the pink-colored sno-cone/cotton candy stand. Opposite the northeast side of the main structure was the green arcade building and directly east of the arcade was a similar-sized blue building which housed the bingo game. Along the north end of the park on the other side of the parking area was maintained a large grove area for picnics and outings. The picnic grove was adjacent to the Nescopeck Creek and was encircled by part of the route of the miniature train tracks. The first manager of the park was Joe Barletta, one of the members of the owner/partnership group. For the 1958 season two additional rides were added, the Panther Car Ride and the Dodgem Bumper Car Ride. An additional building was added to house a waffle and ice cream stand and a park novelty stand. The size of the park expanded with the addition of an Olympic-size swimming pool, the largest such facility in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The pool area was complete with changing rooms, concession and patio areas, a diving area with three separate boards including a 3-meter board, lounge chairs and benches, a spacious lawn area, two separate wading pools for youngsters and both above-ground and below water lighting for night swimming. Many patrons, especially teenagers, bypassed the other attractions and spent an entire day at the pool. It became the major social gathering spot for Hazleton Region youth from the late 1950s through the mid-1980s. Also added was a stage area at the eastern end of the park and television Star Pinky Lee would become the first of several nationally known acts to perform at Angela Park. One year later a record-setting crowd turned out on July 29, 1959, to see Buffalo Bob Smith and the legendary NBC Television Howdy Doody Show perform. 1960s The early 1960s saw more additions to the park. Two major activities oriented attractions were added; a miniature golf course and a baseball batting range. Also added to the summer schedule was the popular Saturday Night Swingout, a weekly dance party broadcast live on WAZL Radio. Frontline entertainment attractions continued as WFIL Philadelphia television personalities Sally Starr and Chief Halftown performed in 1960. Popular regional live bands made weekly appearances both on stage and for after dark pool parties. Groups line Mel Wynne and the Rhythm Aces and Ognir and the Night People drew large crowds of teens. Popular Polka Bands like Lefty and the Polka Chaps and Stanky and the Coal Miners drew large adult followings for Sunday performances. During the mid-1960s several new rides were added including: The Tea Cup Ride (1961), The Paratrooper (1965), The Giant Slide (1966), The Sky Ride (1967) and the Swingin' Gyms (1967). Also during the decade a helicopter ride replaced the airplanes and an antique model car replaced the Panther cars on that ride. During the mid-1960s the miniature train was repainted changing the maroon and black Lehigh Valley Black Diamond to the silver, red and yellow of the Santa Fe War Bonnet. In 1967 Art Holler was hired to replace Joe Barletta as park manager. Holler managed the park for two seasons before resigning. It would be the only two years during the Barletta ownership that a non-partner served as manager. He was replaced by John Barletta who was assisted by his sister Anna DePierro. The two ran the daily operations of the park until the family sold the business following the 1984 season. In 1969 perhaps the most iconic piece of Angela Park was introduced, Porky The Paper Eater. Designed as a high tech trash receptacle, Porky's \\"head\\" stuck out from his \\"house\\". His mouth was an opening that vacuumed in paper and other small trash items into a large garbage container within the house. A taped voice message had Porky encouraging kids to not litter. The novel idea worked better than anticipated with youngsters so mesmerized by the talking Porky they often collected stray trash from the ground so they could feed it to Porky. Later a second version of Porky was introduced, Leo The Paper Eating Lion however it never came close to the popularity of Porky. 1970s In 1970 a golf driving range was constructed at the northeast end of the park. That same year a 1939 Authentic Fire Engine was purchased and the back was fabricated with two vertical rows for seating. With full siren and bell ringing the fire truck would complete a loop around the parks perimeter. For 1971 the Midway kiddie ride was added and the original paratrooper ride was replaced with a more modern version which allowed all cars to be loaded on the ground simultaneously. In 1972 the Satellite Jet ride was added and the original miniature train was replaced by a larger C.P Huntington Civil War Era model. June 1972 saw near disaster as the Nescopeck Creek flooded during Tropical Storm Agnes. The flood waters damaged the picnic grove area, and parts of the golf driving range and turned the parking area into a lake. However the main park area and most of the rides were spared as the waters edge stopped a few feet away. In the mid-1970s the Swingin' Gyms were dismantled and sold while what would be the last two rides were added; The Tilt A Whirl Ride and the Columbus Ride. In 1976 the golf driving range was converted to a lighted softball field. This new field would host a memorable event in late June of that year when the Bicentennial Wagon Train encamped at Angela Park on their way to Philadelphia. This national celebration of the bicentennial was a re-enactment of a Conestoga Wagon Train expedition complete with overnight camping. It drew thousands of visitors to witness this living history experience. 1980s The park experienced few changes after the mid-1970s. When Pennsylvania state law was initiated in 1980 permitting bingo games only by non-profit organizations the popular Sunday bingo games ended at Angela Park and the bingo building was converted into a haunted house ride attraction that never gained popularity. The Barletta Family opened the nearby Edgewood-In-The Pines Golf Course in the fall of 1979 and within the next two years they advertised the availability of Angela Park for sale. During the 1984 season a serious offer to purchase the park was made by Joseph Filoromo of Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Along with his mother they formed the Mirth Master Corporation and in 1985 season they bought Angela Park for $1.2 million. During the next four years Mirth Master fell into worsening financial condition and by 1988 the debt on the park was over $1 million. The financial strains reached a breaking point and Mirth Master declared bankruptcy in the spring of 1989 leaving Filoromo no choice but to close the park. The bank seized the property and put the park up for sale at $2 million. Despite local efforts to raise the capital to purchase the operations as well as individual interest no buyer emerged and Angela Park was all but finished. The official end came on an overcast Saturday in May 1990 when the bank auctioned off the park piece by piece. Several of the Angela Park rides are in operation in different locations. The C.P. Huntington train was sold to the zoo in Erie, Pennsylvania. The tank ride is in Knight's Action Park in Springfield, Illinois. The antique car ride is in a New Jersey park and several of the dodgem bumper cars operate at Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, Pennsylvania. The park's sole roller coaster was the \\"Valley Volcano.\\" Designed by John C. Allen, the coaster was nearly identical to Wyandot Lake's Sea Dragon. During the last few seasons, the park changed the number of cars operating on this coaster, which can be seen in photographs that show the ride with four, three, and two cars on the train. Documentary In 2016, Sam-Son Productions, Inc. announced that they would be creating a documentary on the park and finished the process in 2017. The hour long documentary DVD features footage from the park's opening day through its closure. The documentary also features interviews with some of the park owners and their children (who also worked in the park) plus other former employees and park goers. Sam-Son Productions also acquired the full audio recording to one of the park's most famous trash disposal units (Porky the Paper Eater) and it can be heard in its entirety.

Kenneth Alfred Western (10 September 1899 ‚Äì 24 January 1963) and (Ernest) George Western (23 July 1895 ‚Äì 16 August 1969) were, in reality, second cousins rather than brothers. They first broadcast as the Perfectly Polite Pair in the 1920s, and there was then a long break before they returned as the Western Brothers. Kenneth and George Western- photo of Wills's cigarette card circa 1934 George provided the piano accompaniment to their songs. They wore monocles and evening dress for their act, and affected upper-class drawls. Photographs of them appeared in newspaper advertisements for a number of products. From this and from their act, they made enough money to be able to afford to tour the variety circuit flying in their own aeroplane and to stay in the best hotels. Their songs included \\"We're Frightfully BBC\\" and \\"Keeping Up the Old Traditions\\". The Western Brothers appeared in the 1934 film Mr. Cinders with Clifford Mollison and Zelma O'Neal. They wrote and sang two songs: \\"I Think of You, Dear\\" and \\"Aren't We All?\\" in the reversed roles of \\"ugly stepsisters.\\" The following year they appeared as announcers in Radio Parade of 1935 with Will Hay. In October 1948 they became involved in a controversy because of a joke that Kenneth told between songs during a live performance on the BBC Home Service. The punchline of the joke appeared to suggest that Hugh Gaitskell, then the Minister of Fuel and Power, was guilty of nepotism. The press made a big fuss about this. The BBC edited the joke from the repeat of the programme a few days later, and also broadcast a joint apology from themselves and the Western Brothers. In reply the Brothers received a letter from the Solicitor-General: > Mr Gaitskell is happy to accept your assurance that no personal reflection > was ever intended. He desires me to add that a number of people have asked > him whether he has, in fact, got a nephew in the employ of the National Coal > Board which shows how readily there is assumed to be a substratum of fact > behind such jokes.

Biography Noskowski was born in Warsaw and was originally trained at the Warsaw Conservatory studying violin and composition with Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko, graduated with distinction in 1867. A scholarship enabled him to travel to Berlin where between 1872 and 1875, he studied with Friedrich Kiel, one of Europe‚Äôs leading teachers of composition. After holding several positions - kapellmeister and conductor of the Bodan Choral Society in Konstanz, Noskowski returned to Warsaw in 1880 where he remained for the rest of his life, professor of composition at the Warsaw Conservatory and conductor of Warsaw Society of Friends and the Warsaw Philharmonic (1905-1908). He worked not only as a composer, but also became a famous teacher, a prominent conductor and a journalist. He was one of the leading figures in Polish music during the late 19th century and the first decade of the 20th. He taught virtually all of the important Polish composers of the next generation, including Karol Szymanowski and Grzegorz Fitelberg. He served as head of the Warsaw Music Society from 1880 to 1902 and was considered Poland‚Äôs leading composer during the last decade of his life. He died in Warsaw. While Noskowski is best known for his orchestral compositions, he composed opera, chamber music, instrumental sonatas and vocal works of importance. Discussing Nowkowski's chamber music, the famous critic and scholar Wilhelm Altmann wrote that it was \\"very effective and deserving of public attention and performance.\\" Judging from the piano quartet written in 1879, one can hear that Noskowski had assimilated the recent musical developments taking place in Central Europe but the music, other than structurally, shows little or no influence of any of the major composers of the time, such as Brahms, Liszt, or Wagner, who were then dominating the scene.

It was created near Qaraoun village in 1959 by building a concrete-faced rockfill dam (the largest dam in Lebanon) in the middle reaches of the Litani River (longest river in Lebanon). The reservoir has been used for hydropower generation (), domestic water supply, and for irrigation of . The annual surface water flow in the Litani River received at Lake Qaraoun is . This flow is used for generating hydroelectric power of 600 GWh at three hydroelectric power stations at Markaba, Awali and Jun with the total installed capacity of . During the dry season, of water is diverted from Markaba power station to meet the needs of the Kassmieh irrigation project. The lake is a habitat for some 20,000 migratory birds which visit it annually. Geography The Litani River Note 420 million cubic meters is approximately 15 billion cubic feet or approximately 340,000 acre feet. The upper Litani River, where the artificial lake or reservoir has been created with the dam at elevation of about , is in the inland region of the Beqaa Valley, whose elevation range generally lies between , with mountain peaks raising as high as . The Litani River drains the southern end of the Beqaa Valley plains (a continuation of the Jordan Rift Valley), crossing the southern periphery of the Mount Lebanon range and discharging into the sea north of Tyre, after traversing a length of entirely in Lebanon. The hydrographical system of Lebanon consisting of 40 major streams is typecast into five regions, which includes the Litani River Basin formed by the Litani River in its eastern and southern part, with the river debouching into the sea at the southwestern end. The basin has a total catchment area of , which forms 20% area of the country, with about intercepted at Lake Qaraoun by El Wauroun Dam for providing various benefits. The artificial lake is created across the Litani River in its middle reaches. Litani River is the longest river in Lebanon at the southern end of the Beqaa valley. The Litani River, which lies entirely within the territory of Lebanon rises near the historic city of Baalbek (now the site hardly discernible due to high rate of water extraction in this reach for pumping and ancient city development) and flows through for before it outlets into the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of the 40 major streams in Lebanon and is the longest from the source to the Mediterranean Sea. The land on the periphery of the reservoir consists of agricultural lands on the eastern side where arable crops and olive orchards are seen. Grazing of sheep and goats is also noted. On the steep sloping western periphery of the lake there are fruit orchards and pasture land for grazing. =Geology= The geological formation at the dam axis and the reservoir consists of limestone, chalky marl, and alluvial deposits with semi karstic and karstic limestones both upstream of the reservoir area and along the dam axis. Marl in the reservoir area has low permeability. =Climate= The climate in the catchment of the reservoir is of continental type with 90% of rainfall occurring between November and April, with January experiencing the maximum precipitation. Snowfall is experienced at elevation above . The rainfall incidence in the Beqaa Valley, which widely varies spatially and temporally, is an annual average of in the mountainous region of the upper valley to a low of in the south in the coastal region. However, the average annual rainfall is in the catchment area of about at the reservoir carted at the dam. =Water resources= According to water balance studies carried out for the Litani River, the total inflow of the river at the reservoir location has been assessed as per year, of which 60% is accounted towards aquifer recharge and evapotranspiration. Of the balance of per year of surface water, per year is used for various uses by pumping before the flow reaches the dam. Thus, the flow of is available at the reservoir, in an average year (35-year average flows from 1920s). However, in drought years, the flow could reach a low of , as recorded in 1972‚Äì73). Based on precipitation data, the total annual flow could be as high as . The average annual flow received at the reservoir is utilised through the dam created at the site and diverting it through a series of tunnels and ponds to generate 600 GWh of energy at three hydroelectric power stations ( total installed capacity) located at Markaba, Awali and Jun. The planning done in the 1950s at the time of building the dam and the Qaraoun reservoir envisaged utilization of head available between the dam and the Mediterranean Sea through the three power stations. The river outlet at the end of the cascade of power plants is now to the north of its original outlet. It is also utilised for providing irrigation benefits by diverting per year of water from a channel of the Markaba power station for the Kassmieh Irrigation Project. As result of this development the hydrological regime of the Litani River has been divided into two zones. The basin above the lake is known as the Upper Litani Basin (ULB), and that below the lake is called Litani's lower reaches. Reservoir Lake Qaraoun in the Litani River Basin at Qaraoun. The Qaraoun reservoir or lake created by El Wauroun Dam on the Litani River has a water spread area of . It is the largest artificial lake in Lebanon, located in the southern part of the fertile Beqaa Valley, with a total capacity of about and effective storage (live storage) of . The power generation is a primary benefit, which meets about 7%‚Äì10% of the power requirements in Lebanon. However, the stored waters also provide irrigation benefits with flows of , as 110 million cubic metres is used in South Lebanon and 30 million cubic metres in Beqaa, while is used for domestic water supply in the Southern Lebanon. Controlled reservoir operation also provides flood-control benefits and prevention of water logging in an area of about . During 1999‚Äì2000, the water quality of the reservoir has been investigated from 16 sampling points on the river and its tributaries, by the Ministry of Environment and the Litani River Authority as a part of an exercise to evolve management plan for the Litani River and Lake Qaroun's catchment. It has been noted that seven sewer networks drain directly into the river. Untreated sewage from the towns of Baalbek, Houch el Rafqa, Qaa er Rim, Zahle, Chtoura, Qabb Elias, Bar Elias, Joub Jannine and Qaraoun flow into the Litani River or its tributaries, apart from industrial effluents many factories related to manufacture of sugar, paper, lead, limestone crushers, agro-industries and also from poultry farms, tanneries and slaughterhouses. The pollution is noted by the high recorded values of BOD5 (79 mg/L) and nitrates (1.7 mg/L) in the Litani River. The vegetation in the periphery of the lake consists of woodland, orchards, and low-growing scrub. During water- level variations in the lake, as the stored water is utilised for various beneficial uses, no submerged or emergent vegetation have been noticed. When the water level is at its lowest in the lake, a steppe-like land slope has been noticed with low vegetation of rocky shingle terrain where flocks of larks and lapwings are seen. The bird life in the reservoir area is very notable, as 20,000 migratory birds of species of raptors, storks, pelicans and others species of birds have been sighted. The ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus), greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) and sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) are some of the birds which are of conservation concern, according to the 2008 IUCN Red List. El Qaroun Dam Full view of El Wauroun Dam and Lake Qaraoun. The El Wauroun Dam, built in the middle reaches of the Litani River, has created an artificial lake at () with water-spread area of . It is situated about downstream of the historic city of Baalbek. The dam had been under planning since 1964. The Qaraoun village transferred a land area of for building the dam. The dam, which created the artificial lake or reservoir, is the largest dam built in Lebanon for multipurpose uses of hydropower generation (190 MW), irrigation of , and drinking-water supply. It is a concrete-faced rockfill dam (CFRD) of height built with crest level at elevation , with a dam length of , over karstic limestone formations. The reservoir has a storage capacity of at a maximum pond elevation of . The High Flood Level (HFL) in the reservoir is , where the area of the lake is . The average water level for power generation is , with the lowest level or the minimum draw-down level as . The dam's upstream face is a concrete face of area, with thickness of concrete face varying from at the bottom to at the top. The spillway of the dam is designed for an inflow flood discharge of . The reservoir has a storage capacity of at maximum pond elevation of . Future developments The lake water is proposed to be integrated with a pumped-storage scheme planned under the \\"Qaraoun Lake-Marj et Taouil: Project\\". The plan is to utilise the water stored in this reservoir to be pumped to an upper reservoir, with a dam at maximum water level of to store water pumped from the Qaraoun Lake or reservoir) to maximize power generation during the daily lean period (off-peak hours) of power generation when load demand is low. In this mode of generation, the pumping will require , that would result in a generation of of power. Archaeology The archaeological site of Ain Jaouze overlooks Lake Qaraoun at the foot of Jebel Baruk on the west of the road from Chtaura to Jezzine. Jesuit archaeologist, Auguste Bergy collected flints from the surface of this site, suggested to be similar to those of later neolithic Byblos. Visitor attractions On the western periphery of the lake there are many restaurants and hotels which are popular during late spring and summer. During this time many large boats operate in the lake for lake viewing and also for fishing. In winter, when water level in the lake is high boats are operated to hunt for of birds such as wildfowl, mainly storks, heron, egrets and lark species.

It existed from 1823 to 1929 between Derry Street and Paxton Street along Spring Creek. The park contained two roller coasters, the Coaster Flyer and the Jack Rabbit. History Paxtang Park was leased to the East Harrisburg Street Electric Railway Company on July 19, 1893, for a ten-year term. Plans included constructing a fence surrounding the property, though the park would remain free entry, a pavilion to hold several hundred people, new shaded areas, benches, and a \\"gravity railroad\\" (or scenic railway) for the following season. The gravity railroad was not installed in 1894, nor was it ever operational; it wasn't until 1905 that the park added its first roller coaster - Coaster Flyer. This was a Figure 8 roller coaster and operated from 1905 until 1922. In 1922, the railroad company announced they would not renew the lease on the grounds of Paxtang Park for a fourth lease - they had renewed twice before in 1903 and 1913. They were no longer able to afford the costs of operating the park, so they announced 1922 would be the final season of Paxtang Park. However, in August, an amusement company from Newark, New Jersey was able to take control of the lease from the railroad company. They pledged many improvements to the park, which included a new roller coaster and other amusements. The park had some success, however by the late 1920s, they were struggling to open the park before the Fourth of July, when it used to open before Memorial Day, and they were missing tax payments. In 1930, Steelton Bank and Trust took control of the property, and sold off the amusements and other things at a sale. The park was closed and never reopened.

It lies on the southern edge of the Sidlaw Hills, below Auchterhouse Hill, high. The parish, which is coterminous with the community, had a population of 520 in 2001. The village, formerly known as Milltown of Auchterhouse, straddles the B954 Muirhead to Newtyle road. About east lies the larger village of Kirkton of Auchterhouse, where the church and school are located. Singer Billy MacKenzie lived in the village from 1991 until his death in 1997. Kirkton, in Auchterhouse, was the subject of the painting 'Sidlaw Village, Winter' by James MacIntosh Patrick. History The earliest human settlement discovered around Auchterhouse dates from 3500 to 1000 BC, in the form of stone and bronze tools used by the first farmers to clear woodland. Wheat and barley were grown, and cattle and sheep kept, while a decorated sandstone spindle whorl found at Bonnyton, north of the village, and now kept at the McManus Galleries in Dundee, indicates that wool was spun into thread. A possible henge in Dronley Wood has been revealed by aerial photography, and a stone circle at Templelands was destroyed during railway construction in the 19th century. A stone cairn on West Mains Hill, excavated in 1897, was found to conceal a double burial cist, typical of the period around 2000 BC. The cist contained burnt bones and a bronze dagger blade with ox-horn hilt, which are now in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Other cists were reportedly discovered in the 19th century, and a circular burial mound survives south of Dronley House. Cup marks on stones were found around Auchterhouse Park. An Iron Age hillfort on Auchterhouse Hill occupies a naturally defensible position, and is protected to the east and south east by a set of five ramparts and ditches. Souterrains, thought to have provided storage space for foodstuffs, were discovered in the 18th century near Auchterhouse Mansion and in Kirkton of Auchterhouse, and aerial photography has since revealed further sites at East Adamston, Bonnyton, Burnhead of Auchterhouse and Quarry House. Long cists, slab-lined graves in which fully extended bodies were placed, are commonly associated with the period between 1000 BC and 500 AD, and have been recorded at Auchterhouse Park, Leoch and Templeton. A parish church, dedicated to Saint Mary, had been founded by 1238, and Sir John Ramsay played host to both Sir William Wallace and King Edward I of England at Wallace Tower, now part of Auchterhouse Mansion, in 1303. The village came under the jurisdiction of James Stewart, the Earl of Buchan in 1469. He also held the title Lord Auchterhouse, and was the uncle of King James III. The adoption of new agricultural techniques in the 18th and 19th centuries led to increased prosperity in rural areas. Between 1820 and 1850 farm production in Scotland increased by 58 per cent. This new wealth was reflected in Auchterhouse with the construction of new farm buildings at Dronley, East Adamston, Eastfield, Kirkton of Auchterhouse, Leoch and Templeton. Balbeuchley was one of the earliest improved steadings in the area, built in 1802, while Balbeuchley House was built for Patrick Miller, proprietor of the Auchterhouse Estate from 1820 to 1876. The farmhouse at Pitpointie, dated 1883, was built on the site of an earlier steading for George Willsher, a Dundee wine and spirit dealer. Originally built in 1707, the water powered corn mill at Dronley was rebuilt during this period, and stone quarries were developed at Leoch and Parkside, but perhaps the greatest change to the village came with the opening of the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, one of Scotland's first passenger lines, in 1831. Sandstone for the line was quarried at Pitpointie. On 2 May 1899 a meeting was held at the Town Hall in Dundee to establish a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis. Plans were drawn up for the creation of a 30-bed hospital, and a site at Auchterhouse Park was gifted by David Ogilvy, the Earl of Airlie. Construction started in 1901, and Dundee Sanatorium was formally opened on 26 September 1902, at a cost of ¬£20,764. The Dundee Advertiser commented: The first patients were admitted on 11 March 1903, and the following year the institution was renamed the Sidlaw Sanatorium. During the first year of operation, 87 patients were admitted. One patient died, but 67 were discharged. The average stay was just under four months. By 1907 the sanatorium was making a yearly loss of between ¬£500 and ¬£700, and the annual report complained that although the institution was endowed to help the working classes of Dundee, it was not possible to do this due to the need to accept paying patients to contribute to the costs. By 1909 the financial position was so serious that the directors agreed to close the sanatorium the following year, but Sir James Caird, the Dundee jute baron, agreed to provide ¬£1,000 per year if the institution was taken over by Dundee Royal Infirmary, and the transfer was completed in October 1910. The sanatorium eventually closed in 1969 but continued as an NHS convalescent and respite care home until 4 November 1980 (according to the national archives). Geography Auchterhouse stands below the southern slopes of the Sidlaw Hills. The Auchterhouse Burn flows south to join the Dronley Burn, which continues across the south of the community, joining the Dighty Water on the southern boundary of Auchterhouse. This then flows eastwards, to the north of Dundee, to join the Firth of Tay at Monifieth. The land rises from south to north, reaching at Auchterhouse Hill, the highest point in the community. In the north the land consists of moorlands over underlying sandstone. The lower lying southern parts consist of glacial till which, when drained, produces good crops of oats, barley, potatoes and turnips, and is suitable for dairy farming. There are a number of spruce and Scots pine plantations, particularly on the higher ground. Transport A feasibility study to build a railway from Strathmore to Dundee was proposed in 1825, and the first meeting of the Dundee and Newtyle Railway Company took place the following year. Construction started rapidly, and the section from Hatton to Balbeuchley was completed by 1827. The line opened on 16 December 1831. The coaches were, at first, drawn up the Hatton incline by a newly installed stationary engine, with horses providing the power from the top of the incline. The horses were assisted by a wagon sheet on a pole attached to the carriage to harness favourable winds. A second stationary engine was installed at Balbeuchley the following year, and in 1833 two steam engines, the Earl of Airlie and the Lord Wharncliffe, replaced horses on the level sections. Coal and lime were carried from Dundee, while in the other direction, fruit was transported and stone from local quarries provided building material for the rapidly expanding city. In addition, 31,000 passengers were being carried by 1833. In 1834 a locomotive derailment at Pitpointie resulted in the death of John Anderson, the miller at Auchterhouse. In 1846 the line was leased to the Dundee and Perth Railway Company, which changed its name to the Dundee and Perth and Aberdeen Junction Railway Company two years later. The route was diverted through Dronley, avoiding the Balbeuchley incline, in 1860, resulting in Auchterhouse station being resited and a new Dronley station provided. In 1861 the line was extended from Newtyle to Alyth. It was absorbed by the Scottish Central Railway Company in 1863, which in turn was taken over by the Caledonian Railway Company in 1865. Three years later, the Hatton incline was eliminated, and a deviation built into Newtyle. The Caledonian Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company under the Railways Act 1921. Severe snow storms hit Angus in February 1947, and a passenger train was snowed in at Dronley cutting for over a week. Severe rationing still existed at the time, the roads were blocked, and the coal from the stranded engine was stolen, so that more had to be sent for to get the engine started again. There were also problems at Auchterhouse station, where snow drifts blocked the line under the road bridge. It would have been a massive task to dig out the drift, so a pair of large locomotives was sent from Newtyle, with a large snowplough attached. Although the engines managed to get some distance, the drivers soon realised they would need to get up speed before tackling the drifts. The engines and snowplough reversed back along the line and then charged. The force caused by the displaced snow as the engines passed through the station was so great that there was hardly a pane of glass left in the signal box or station buildings, and all the doors were smashed. It took over a week to repair the damage. Following the damage caused by World War II, in 1948 the United Kingdom's railways were nationalised, and the line became part of British Railways. It survived for just seven years, with passenger services withdrawn on 10 January 1955. Freight services continued, but the Auchterhouse‚ÄìNewtyle section closed in 1958, and the remaining route to Dundee ceased operation on 5 April 1965. Education By 1873 public schools had been established in Auchterhouse for both boys and girls. Children attended between the ages of five and 13, and of the 165 living in the parish, 141 were enrolled. By the following year, just nine children were not attending, and the school board instructed an officer to call and warn their parents that proceedings would be taken if their absences continued. A report in 1875 highlighted deficiencies in the girls' school: In response, the school board set about merging the two schools, a new teacher for the girls was appointed, to be under the supervision of the boys' teacher, and the girls' school building was refitted as a home for the female teacher. The new arrangement did not work well, and following professional disagreements between the two teachers, it was decided to operate two separate schools in the same building. Auchterhouse Primary School continues to provide primary education, and had 55 pupils in 2010, including nine in the nursery class. The school holds an Eco- Schools Green Flag award. It was last inspected by Education Scotland in 2010. At the age of 11, pupils transfer to Monifieth High School, located at Monifieth, south east of Auchterhouse. The school was last inspected in 2006, when it had 1,071 pupils. Religion The parish church, dedicated to Saint Mary, had been founded by 1238. The original building was replaced by a Gothic structure in 1426, and was in turn replaced in 1630. It has been described as \\"the last specimen of early church architecture in Scotland\\". Due to a structural defect, it was partially rebuilt in 1775. It now consists of a rectangular chancel at the east end, a large rectangular nave, and a western tower. Two Norman fonts dating from the original 13th-century church remain, and a stone marked \\"Ave Maria\\" is incorporated into the east gable of the present building. A clock at the rear of the church was made by the Dundee clockmaker Thomas Ivory. Underneath the present church is an old burial vault containing remains of the Buchan, Lyon and Ogilvy families, but there are no memorial tablets. Despite the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland forbidding the practice in 1643, burials continued to take place under the rush-strewn dirt floor. John Glas, the founder of the Glasite sect in the First Great Awakening, a Christian revitalisation movement that swept Protestant Europe in the 18th century, preached at Auchterhouse in 1721. He was the minister at nearby Tealing, where his preaching drew a large congregation. In The Testimony of the King of Martyrs Concerning His Kingdom, published in 1729, he claimed that every national church established by the laws of earthly kingdoms was anti-Christian, and repudiated Presbyterianism. He was suspended by the church in 1728, and formed a breakaway church in Dundee. In 1739 the Church of Scotland restored his status as a minister. A strongbox containing the poor money, destined to relieve poverty in the parish, was broken into and stolen in 1789, and two men were detained but later acquitted. A reward of ¬£5 was advertised in the Edinburgh newspapers: Sport Clay target shooting is held at Auchterhouse Country Sports, one of the shooting grounds used for the selection of the Scottish Clay Target Association's national teams, and where the all round Scottish championship was held in 2011. The centre, located in a former quarry, also hosts archery, falconry, quad biking, paintball and tank driving.

Coming-of-age films focus on the psychological and moral growth or transition of a protagonist from youth to adulthood. Personal growth and change is an important characteristic of this genre, which relies on dialogue and emotional responses, rather than action. The story is sometimes told in the form of a flashback. Historically, coming- of-age films usually centred on young boys, although coming-of-age films focusing on girls have become more common in the early 21st century.Kate Erbland, \\"7 Female-Centric Coming-of-Age Movies to Watch If You Loved ‚ÄòLady Bird‚Äô\\".

The perimeter walls survive from the Roman period. Portus Adurni was a Roman fortress in the Roman province of Britannia situated at the north end of Portsmouth Harbour. Listed in the Notitia Dignitatum, it is generally accepted as having been the structure located at adjoining Portchester in the English county of Hampshire, which was later converted into a medieval castle known as Portchester Castle. It is the best-preserved Roman fort north of the Alps. Around an eighth of the fort has been excavated. Identification The name Portus Adurni appears only in the list of Saxon Shore forts in the 5th century Notitia Dignitatum, and the name is usually identified with Portchester,Group 6: southern Hampshire/northern Wiltshire - Britannia in the Ravenna Cosmography although it has occasionally been identified with the Roman fort at Walton Castle, Suffolk (which has now disappeared into the sea).A. Rivet, C. Smith, (1979-1982), The Place-names of Roman Britain,, page 442. Batsford Ltd. London. Portus Adurni may be identical with the Ardaoneon listed in the Ravenna Cosmography, and Rivet and Smith derive both names from the British \\"ardu-\\" meaning \\"height\\". This derivation fits Portchester (which lies beneath Portsdown Hill) better than a flat location such as Walton Castle. Roman fort fort, including the Saxon gate and Norman priory church The fort was built during the 3rd century as part of the Saxon Shore forts to protect the southern coastline of Britain, possibly from Saxon raiders. It occupies a commanding position at the head of Portsmouth Harbour. The fort is square, enclosing an area of 9 acres (36,000 m¬≤) with outer walls 20 feet (6 m) high, 10 feet (3 m) thick, 210 yards (200 m) long and constructed of coursed flint bonded with limestone slabs. Square shaped forts became widely used during the 3rd century, being highly practical and defensible. Portus Adurni has towers all along the walls, as well as towers that angle out at the corners. Historians feel this paramount concern for defensibility may reflect the seriousness of the Saxon raids during this time or the defensive holding point of Carausian Revolt (see below). The gates of Portus Adurni are of particular interest: they are indented inwards, so as to trap the enemy in an area exposed to walls on three sides; this technique became widely used from the Augustinian age to the fall of the Empire. Unusually for a building of this period, most of the walls and bastions are complete. It has lost only four of its bastions. The walls themselves have been quarried to provide stone for later additions, but from the outside at least they appear much as they did when they were first built. The walls were made in groups, by groups of gangs, which explains the different textures as you walk along the outer perimeter. History The fort's walls survive close to their full height. The Saxon Shore forts, including Portus Adurni, were built during the mid to late 3rd century amid increased instability in north- eastern Gaul and the Rhineland, eventually leading to the Roman evacuation of that area. The forts were intended to maintain control over the region, and monitor shipping and trade, as well as defending against raids from across the English Channel. These forts became defensive holding points for the rebel Carausius, who in 285 was given the task of solving the Saxon piracy problem in the English Channel. When Carausius was charged with keeping the pirates' booty for himself, he retreated to Britain and proclaimed himself Emperor. The revolt went on for almost 10 years while other Roman generals tried and failed to dislodge him, until he was eventually murdered by Allectus, one of his aides, in 293, and Britain was finally taken back by 296. We do not know who built Portus Adurni. While some of the Saxon Shore forts were built under previous commanders and emperors, some were built by Carausius during his revolt. Evidence suggests that Portus Adurni was built during the time of Carausius. Many of the coins uncovered at the site were minted by Carausius as emperor during his revolt. Anglo-Saxon high-status residence Even after the departure of the Roman Army Portus Adurni's location and strong walls made it attractive as a fortress. The fort became an Anglo-Saxon high-status residence with great hall and tower. Later the Roman gateways were rebuilt as well. Later history The circuit walls of the fort became the outer bailey wall of a Norman castle and later medieval palace. It was used as a gaol during the Napoleonic Wars. Its exceptional condition can therefore be attributed to the fact that, despite short periods of abandonment and longer periods of neglect, the fort was occupied for almost sixteen centuries. The site is owned by the Southwick Estate but managed by English Heritage and is open to visitors throughout the year. References ;Notes ;Bibliography *Bunson, Matthew.

Gameplay In the game, players must travel around the world to different cities solving various kinds of puzzles to capture the seven \\"tricksters\\" - Maui, Puck, Eris, Coyote, Monkey, Anansi and Raven. Each trickster has a challenge puzzle after finding all the missing box pieces, acquired by solving the puzzle with each piece behind it in each city. The location of the pieces is randomized each game. The game offers sporadic bonuses. Hints are used to find where one piece goes if the player needs help figuring it out. Free puzzle tokens solve puzzles for the player if needed. A free puzzle token is awarded for every ten puzzles solved. =Puzzle types= Most puzzle types in the game are variations on the basic concept of a tiling puzzle, and often involve famous paintings, statues, photos of notable places around the world, or other artifacts: *Find and Fill is a puzzle where outlines of elements of an image are overlapped with each other, and the player must find and color elements, like a coloring book. *Focus Point is a tiling puzzle where the player must switch tiles of a jumbled image to restore the original picture; however, tiles are of different size, and they stretch or squeeze if placed into a larger or smaller slot. *Image Hole is a puzzle where the final image is invisible except through constantly moving holes that are the shapes of various elements of the image; the player must guide the holes to their correct places and lock them. *Overlap is a jigsaw puzzle where pieces may overlap each other; some pieces contain parts of the background pattern for the easier initial placement. *Interlock is a triangle-based dissection puzzle. *Jesse's Strips is a jigsaw puzzle where pieces may overlap each other; pieces are also distributed among five different trays that filter out certain colors of the image. *Lens Bender is a puzzle where the player must reconstruct an image by placing the pieces under various lens until they are distorted into a shape where they connect with each other. *Outer Layer is a puzzle where the player must place parts of a texture back on a 3D object. *Rotascope is a sliding puzzle that places the tiles on multiple concentric circles. *Slices provides the player with a 3D object that was broken up to slices horizontally; the player must rotate the pieces and rebuild the object in the correct order. Towards the end of the game, as the difficulty ramps up, some puzzles get combined into being stages of one larger puzzle, e.g. the player must first solve a Rotascope puzzle, where the result of that puzzle is actually a Focus Point puzzle.

A member of the Pakalomattom family (Thazhmon, Ayroor) he appealed to outside authorities to assert his position as the sole leader of the Malankara Church and to attempt to reunite all the Saint Thomas Christians. Thoma VI succeeded Mar Thoma V as Malankara Metropolitan in 1765, and unlike his predecessors, who were said by their opponents not to have been properly ordained as bishop, he received orders from Syriac Orthodox bishops in 1772, thus ending any controversy. Other events of his reign include the separation of the Thozhiyoor church (now the Malabar Independent Syrian Church), the arrival of English Protestant missionaries, and the first translation of the Bible from Syriac to Malayalam. Life The man who would be Dionysius was the nephew of his predecessor as Malankara Metropolitan, Mar Thoma V, and a member of the Pakalomattom family. In 1757, as part of a play to assert his authority and autonomy in the Syriac Orthodox Church, Thoma V consecrated his nephew as coadjutor bishop and named him his successor, in contradiction to the wishes of the Syriac Orthodox hierarchy. Upon Thoma V's death in 1765, the younger Pakalomattom was ordained as Metropolitan on 8 May, taking the name Thoma VI.Neill, p. 67.Vadakkekara, p. 91. As with his predecessors as Metropolitan going back to the first, Mar Thoma I, Thoma VI's critics charged that his succession, and therefore his position, was invalid. To overcome this criticism, in 1772 Thoma VI underwent a second ordination at the hands of the Syriac Orthodox bishop Gregorios in the church in Niranam. He received all the Holy Orders, from the tonsure to the episcopal consecration, and thereafter took the name Mar Dionysius.Neill, pp. 67‚Äì68. Syriac Orthodox and other critics of Thoma VI saw this as his only ordination, while his supporters saw it as a \\"re-ordination\\", but either way, it ended the controversy over the validity of his position.Vadakkekara, pp. 91‚Äì92. This done, Dionysius focused on his second primary aim of securing his place as the sole head of the Malankara Church, a measure opposed by some in the Syriac Orthodox hierarchy. To this end, Dionysius appealed to both the Catholic Church and the British colonial government in India. Several times he contacted the Catholic hierarchy, both locally and in Rome, seeking to have his church, with him as its designated head, brought into full communion. This would have the double aim of solidifying his authority, and re-uniting all the Saint Thomas Christians, who had been split into Catholic and independent (Malankara) factions since the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653. His appeals were considered in Rome, where the Church was willing to grant him temporal but not spiritual authority over the Saint Thomas Christians. In the end, however, no satisfactory deal was ever made and the factions remained separate.Neill, pp. 68‚Äì69. In 1771, Gregorios consecrated a second bishop, Kattumangatt, who took the name Cyril (Koorilose). Dionysius saw Cyril as a threat to his authority, and appealed to the colonial authorities to suppress the rival bishop. Cyril left for Thozhiyur, outside of the colonial jurisdiction, and established what would become an independent church. This body is now known as the Malabar Independent Syrian Church.Vadakkekara, p. 92. Subsequently, however, Gregorios and the other Syrian bishops died and were not replaced, leaving no further internal challengers to Dionysius.Neill, p. 69. Invasion by Mysore Mysore was a land locked kingdom. Hyder Ali, ruler of this kingdom decided to invade Malabar to get access to the Arabian Sea. He entered Malabar in 1781 and crushed the Nair soldiers. After his death Tippu Sultan came to the throne. During that period Christians were persecuted.Sankunny Menon, P.

Shungunny Menon, p. 246.Puthenkavu Cathedral Smaranika, pp. 175, 183. Relations with the Church of England Toward the end of Dionysius' reign, Claudius Buchanan (1766‚Äì1815) visited Kerala in 1806, and arranged for the translation of the Bible into Malayalam. Dionysius gave him the manuscript of the Bible written in the Syriac language. This manuscript was later deposited in the public library of the University of Cambridge.Buchanan, Rev. Claudius, Memoir of the Expediency of an Ecclesiastical Establishment for British India, p. 76. During the visit Buchanan suggested the Malankara Church seek a close relationship with the Church of England. Soon after his visit, Dionysius convened a meeting of church elders at Aarthattu, where he declared the Malankara Church would not accept Anglican doctrine, nor those of any other foreign church.Mathew, P.C. Aarthattu Padiola, Nazrani Christians of Kerala, p. 114. Death and succession Dionysius consecrated Pakalomattom Mathen Kathanar as his successor in 1796 at Chengannur church. Dionysius died on 8 April 1808 at Niranam, and he was interred St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral, Puthencavu, with Mathen conducting the funeral service. Mathen subsequently received his orders, taking the name Mar Thoma VII. Notes References * *Vadakkekara, Benedict (2007). Origin of Christianity in India: a Historiographical Critique.

Democratic Party dominance in Rhode Island For nearly five decades, Rhode Island has been one of the nation's most solidly Democratic states. Since 1928, it has voted for the Republican presidential candidate only four times (Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1984) and it has elected only two Republicans (former Governor John H. Chafee and later his son, Lincoln Chafee, though the younger Chafee eventually became a Democrat during his later governorship) to the U.S. Senate since 1934. Rhode Island also sent no Republicans to the U.S. House from 1940 until 1980, when one Republican and one Democrat were elected. Also in 1980, Rhode Island was one of only six states to be won by Jimmy Carter. However, in 1984, Republican Edward DiPrete was elected governor and Ronald Reagan narrowly carried the state in the presidential election. In the 2000 presidential election, Democrat Al Gore won 61% of the popular vote. Although, an analysis of Gallup polling data shows the Democratic advantage over the Republican Party in Rhode Island voters has plunged over the last two years. The Democratic advantage over the Republican Party in Rhode Island slid from 37 percentage points in 2008 to 16 points this year, according to Gallup. Rhode Island has gone from being the most Democratic state in the country in 2008 to the 7th most Democratic now.

History Since its inception in 1889, South Dakota has been a Republican-leaning state through most of its existence, despite substantial changes to political party platforms. The history of the state's Democratic Party can be condensed into two separate time periods, each marked by a very different national atmosphere and legislative approach to past agrarian policy. 1914 was a milestone for the Democrats when they won South Dakota's first senate election by popular vote with their first statewide elected official, Edwin S. Johnson. This was their first success since William Jennings Bryan successfully campaigned (a novelty at the time) for the state's electoral votes in 1896 with help from an agrarian crisis. Nevertheless, it wasn't until the sweeping elections of 1932 that the Democratic Party took firm control as the party of the New Deal. With supermajorities in the state legislature and control of the governorship, the Democrats were able to set about securing newly available federal aid, replacing property tax with income and sales taxes, and instituting unemployment insurance. While Democrats managed only one solid two-year election cycle in the 40s and 50s, a young 2-term House member and Kennedy administration veteran with a strong understanding of agricultural policy, George McGovern, changed the party's fortunes when he squeaked out a win against incumbent Joe Foss in 1962's Senate election. An ardent opponent of the Vietnam War, McGovern's popularity and profile were on an upward trajectory that would only be shadowed by his presidential run in 1972. Despite his landslide loss to Republican incumbent Richard Nixon, he continued to serve in the U.S. Senate for 9 more years as his party came to power at the state level. Forty years after the New Dealers had brokered a tenuous, short-lived agreement with the farmers and workers of South Dakota and ninety years after The Boy Orator of the Platte wooed voters on his \\"Whirlwind through the Midwest\\", the Democrats were back. This time, they rode two decades of failed farm politics and favorite son McGovern's election bid to a slim 1 seat majority in the Senate, even slimmer tie breaking control in the House and a re-election win by Governor Richard F. Kneip. An electronic voterbase and superior get-out-the-vote operation helped many overcome long-time Republican incumbents who'd become lethargic campaigners. At about the same time in 1968, South Dakota Democrats gained a relatively small but increasingly active voting group when the Indian Civil Rights Act was passed.Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998). Since then, the state has created house districts 28A (in 1996) and 26A (in 2012) as majority-minority districts. These seats have been mostly reliably blue in an otherwise sea of red outside larger cities. Since their heyday in the seventies, the South Dakota Democrats have since seen their influence decline in the state, in large part due to divisions within the state party caused by wedge issues like Roe v. Wade and the Oahe Irrigation Project. Oahe was supported by party leaders like George McGovern but blocked by environmentalists as well as the Democratic President at the time, Jimmy Carter. This splintering was only magnified by the fading of McGovern from the political spotlight, a liberal mainline Protestant who had tried to keep himself and his party insulated from the religiously conservative backlash against liberal social policies. While most couldn't avoid the rightward drift of the state's politics (including McGovern himself), two Democratic representatives and senators, Tom Daschle and Tim Johnson, followed in his footsteps, each winning elections over the course of two decades in spite of an increasingly conservative statewide electorate that has generally voted for Republican presidents, governors and legislatures in recent election cycles. Currently, 31% of South Dakota voters are registered as Democrats compared to 46% registered as Republicans, putting the Democrats at a disadvantage in the state. Currently, Republicans hold every statewide elected office, as well as both of the state's seats in the United States Senate and its sole seat in the House of Representatives. In 2016, the Republicans had their best showing in the House in 40 years and won their record 12th straight presidential vote. To those points, Democrats in South Dakota are now looking for a reset which will reshape the state party to draw in voters from all ideological backgrounds. In September 2019, the last two offices of the South Dakota Democratic Party closed down due to the lack of funding. Current elected leaders The South Dakota Democratic Party does not hold any of the statewide offices and is a minority in both the South Dakota Senate and the South Dakota House of Representatives. Democrats have no members in the state's U.S Congressional delegation (the U.S Senate seats or the House At-Large seat). ;State *5 seats in the State Senate and 11 seats in the State Househttp://sdlegislature.gov/Legislators/default.aspx?Session=2020 ;Federal *None External links *South Dakota Democratic Party References Category:Democratic Party (United States) by state Democratic Party ","title":"South Dakota Democratic Party"},{"id":"9428856","text":"John William Ainsley (30 June 1898 ‚Äì 23 June 1976) was a British coal miner and Labour Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament for North West Durham from 1955 to 1964. Working life Ainsley was born on 30 June 1898, the son of John George Ainsley. Ainsley attended elementary school before enlisting in the Durham Light Infantry in 1916 to fight in the First World War. When he returned, he became a coal miner. He continued his education at evening classes and through correspondence courses.Stenton and Lees Who's Who of British Members of Parliament vol. iv p. 2 Local politics Ainsley joined the Labour Party and helped the party by acting as the agent running election campaigns. In 1942 he was appointed to Durham County Council (elections having been suspended during the war), where he specialised in education and became Chairman of the Education Committee; served on the council until 1956, including a term as Chair from 1953 to 1955, and as Alderman the following year. In December 1950 he was part of a delegation to central government over Durham County Council's decision to institute a closed shop for all its employees. He was vice-chairman of the County Council in 1952 and Chairman from 1953 to 1955. He was Chairman of the Northern Advisory Council for Further Education from 1951. Parliament For the 1955 general election, Ainsley was selected as Labour Party candidate for North West Durham. He supported the mining industry, calling for more investment in British mines rather than importing coal from Rhodesia. He was a supporter of nationalisation who opposed an attempt in 1957 to water down party policy. He defended his old regiment from attempts to merge it. An active Methodist who was a local preacher, Ainsley served in the Methodist Youth department. He was generally loyal to the Labour Party (never breaking the whip), and when asked in 1959, he withdrew his name from a motion which opposed any move of NATO aircraft from French to British bases. In 1960 he called for a rise in the school leaving age to 16, and in 1961 he urged integration of the independent schools with the state system and fully comprehensive mixed-sex schools.

It is headquartered in downtown Austin, Texas. History Prior to the Annexation of Texas, the Democratic Party had a foothold in the politics of the region. A powerful group of men that called themselves the \\"Texas Association\\" served as an early prototype for the Democratic Party of Texas. The Texas Association drew its membership from successful merchants, doctors, and lawyers, often traveling from Tennessee. Many members of the Texas Association were close friends of US President Andrew Jackson, and most had strong ties to the Democratic Party. Similarly, most of the other settlers in Texas were from states in the South, and White American southerners of this era generally held strong allegiances to the Democratic Party. In 1845, the 29th United States Congress approved the Texas Constitution and President James K. Polk signed the act admitting Texas as a state on December 29. In 1848, the party convention system was adopted, and it quickly became the primary method of selecting candidates for the Texas Democratic Party. In the period prior to the Civil War, national politics influenced the state party's perspective. Texas Democrats began to discard Jacksonian-nationalism in favor of the states' rights agenda of the Deep South. A conflict emerged within the Party between a minority of pro-Union Democrats and a majority of secessionists. During the war, supporters of the Union disappeared from the political scene or moved north. Those who stayed politically active supported the Confederacy. During Reconstruction, the rift between Unionist and Secessionist Democrats remained. For a short period immediately after the war, the Texas Democratic Party was a formidable political force, but they quickly split apart because their positions on freedmen varied greatly; some supported basic civil rights, while most opposed anything more than emancipation. As a result, Republicans captured both the governor's office and the Texas Legislature in 1869, but Republican political dominance in the post-Civil War era was short-lived. By 1872, the Texas Democrats had consolidated their party and taken over the Texas legislature.\\"Scalawag#cite ref-1.\\" Republican Politics and Reconstruction For the remainder of the 19th century and well into the 20th, Democrats dominated Texas politics and Republicans were minor political players. President Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-1969) In the presidential election of 1928, anti-Catholicism in Texas and across the country swung the Lone Star State away from Democratic presidential nominee Al Smith, the first time it ever voted against a Democrat in a presidential election. However, it was not until the middle of the 20th century that the Democrats began to face a growing challenge from the Republican Party in earnest. The 1950s was a decade of factionalism and infighting for the Texas Democratic Party, mainly between liberal and conservative Democrats, and the Republicans managed to carry Texas for native Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956. Cohesion returned to the party in the 1960s, and the Democratic ticket carried Texas in the 1960 presidential election with prominent Texas Senator Lyndon B. Johnson running for Vice President. In 1962, John B. Connally, a moderate Democrat, was elected Governor of Texas. The next year, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on a trip to Dallas created further impetus to bridge the gap between liberal and moderate Texas Democrats; Party unity was solidified with Johnson's ensuing Presidency and the drubbing of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. In 1964, Johnson carried his home state with ease, but liberal forces in Texas were in decline. In the 1968 presidential election, Democrat Hubert Humphrey barely managed to win Texas. In 1976, Jimmy Carter became the last Democratic presidential candidate to carry Texas, and the tide was clearly turning when Democrats lost the gubernatorial election of 1978. Bill Clements was the first Republican governor since Reconstruction. By the 1990s Republicans had gained a strong foothold in the state, and throughout the 21st century they have been largely victorious. Currently, both houses of the Texas Legislature feature Republican majorities. At the federal level, Republicans hold both of the state's Senate seats and 24 out of the possible 36 House of Representatives seats allotted to Texas. Activities The Texas Democratic Party is the primary organization responsible for increasing the representation of its ideological base in state, district, county, and city government. Its permanent staff provides training and resources for Democratic candidates within the state, particularly on grassroots organization and fundraising. Texas State Historical Association: Texas Democratic Handbook. Retrieved December 5, 2011 The Party organization monitors political discourse in the state and speaks on behalf of its members. The party employs a full- time Communications Director who is responsible for the organization's communications strategy, which includes speaking with established state and national media. Press releases regarding current issues are often released through the by permanent staff. Texas Democratic Party Official Website: Media Staff. Retrieved December 5, 2011 The party also maintains a website with updates and policy briefs on issues pertinent to its ideological base. Its online presence also includes Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts, each of which has thousands of followers and is used to update followers on the most recent events affecting the party. The Party also oversees several e-mail and text messaging groups that send periodic updates to millions of followers. A major function of the Texas Democratic Party is to raise funds to maintain the electoral infrastructure within its organization. Funds are used to provide for a permanent staff, publish communication and election material, provide training to candidates, and to pay for legal services. The organization hosts biennial conventions that take place at precinct, county, and state level. The purpose of the precinct convention is to choose delegates to the county convention, and the delegates who gather at the county conventions are mainly concerned with selecting delegates to the state convention. The purpose of the state convention is to appoint the state executive committee, adopt a party platform, and officially certify the party's candidates to be listed on the general election ballot. The State Democratic Executive Committee (SDEC) includes one Committeeman and one Committeewoman from each of the 31 districts, plus a chairman and a vice- chairman. The SDEC members are elected by the convention's delegates. In presidential election years, the state convention also chooses delegates to go to the Democratic National Convention. Delegates also elect a state party chair. At the 2012 Texas Democratic Party Convention in Houston, delegates elected Gilberto Hinojosa as the new chair of the state party. Hinojosa is a former school board trustee, district judge, and county judge from Cameron County. Hinojosa replaced retiring chair Boyd Richie, who had been chair since April 22, 2006. The State Democratic Executive Committee adopted the 2020 Delegate Selection Plan for submission to the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee. Texas sends the second largest delegation to the Democratic National Convention. Texas‚Äô delegation is 281 persons, 262 delegates and 19 alternates. The delegates selected are in three categories: 149 District-Level delegates selected by attendees at the state convention by senate district caucuses of the supporters of each candidate who wins delegates. A candidate must have won at least 15% of the vote in the senate district to win district delegates. While looking at the statewide votes, the Texas Democratic Party also examines how each candidate performed in each of the 31 state senate districts. The same rule applies that a candidate must have won at least 15% of the vote in the senate district to win district delegates.https://act.txdemocrats.org/page/-/Rules%20of%20the%20Texas%20Democratic%20Party%20June%2C%202018%20%281%29.pdf Based on the strength of Democrats voting for the presidential nominee in 2016 (Clinton) and the governor nominee in 2018 (Valdez), the party has already assigned the 149 district delegates across all 31 senate districts. The bluest district (SD 14 in Austin) will have 10 national delegates to allocate. The smallest districts (SD 31 and SD 28 in the Panhandle) only have two 49 At- Large Delegates and 30 Pledged Elected and Party Officials (PLEO) are selected by a nominations committee process at the state convention. On election night, the winner is determined. A candidate must get 15% statewide to win At-Large and PLEO delegates. The Party will assign the statewide percentages to the 49 At-Large and then to the 30 PLEO delegates. There are 34 automatic delegates (formerly called superdelegates). These individuals are unpledged and are selected because of their party positions as either Democratic members of Congress or Democratic National Committee members. Under a new national rule in place for 2020, these individuals automatically attend, but they don‚Äôt have a vote in the nominating process unless the convention delegates are unable to select a nominee by majority vote on the first ballot. They vote on all other matters such as the platform and rules and have a nominating vote on any second or subsequent ballot for the presidential nomination. In accordance with bylaws, the entire delegation is equally balanced by gender, half male and half female. Affirmative action goals are set for historically underrepresented groups: Hispanics, African Americans, Asians and Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, LGBT Texans, youth (people under 36) and people with disabilities. The most important step in this process is for Democrats to ‚Äúallocate‚Äù the delegates among the presidential candidates. This is done in a presidential primary that will be held on ‚ÄúSuper Tuesday‚Äù March 3, 2020. Candidates file to be on the ballot between November 9 and December 9, 2019 with the Texas Democratic Party.https://www.texasdemocrats.org/blog/so-you- want-to-be-a-delegate-for-your-favorite-presidential-candidate-texas- democrats-2020-series/ Controversies =Texas eleven= In 2003, a group of Democratic state legislators referred to as the Texas Eleven fled to New Mexico and Oklahoma to prevent the passage of dramatic redistricting legislation that would benefit Republicans. U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay called for the lawful arrest of the Texas Eleven. Their absence prevented a quorum during a special 30-day session of the legislature; afterwards, when Senator John Whitmire conceded, the rest followed, because his presence on the Senate floor met quorum. =Texas Two-Step= At the 2010 convention, Texas Democrats voted to keep the controversial Two-Step system. Most states use either a primary or a caucus in order to determine presidential nominees, but Texas uses a combination of both. The antipathy towards George W. Bush and the allure of a contentious race drew almost 3 million Democrats to the primary polls. During the Democratic Presidential caucuses, thousands of new Texas Democrats showed up and overwhelmed the old- guard party officials. Factions of the Texas Democrats complained that this populist outburst wreaked havoc on the caucus process. Almost immediately after the results, Party regulars began calling to change the system or even to abolish the caucus altogether. In the end, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, but Barack Obama's well-organized campaign won the caucus. In 2015, the Democratic National Committee ruled the Texas Democratic Party could no longer use the Texas Two Step in their presidential primary process. The current process that will govern the 2020 election is listed under Activities. Current elected officials The Texas Democratic Party holds 13 of the state's 36 U.S. House seats, 12 of the state's 31 Texas Senate seats, and 64 of the state's 150 Texas House of Representatives seats. =Members of Congress= U.S. Senate *None Both of Texas's U.S. Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 1993.

The party advocates progressivism and American liberalism. Through most of its history, at least from the time of the American Civil War until the 1960s, Vermont was an almost exclusively Republican state, with Republicans dominating Vermont politics, especially the Governorship, from 1854-1960.Appleton, Andrew & Ward, Daniel. \\"State Party Profiles\\". Congressional Quarterly Inc, 1997. p. 324. However, perhaps inspired by the election of John F. Kennedy as US President in 1960, Vermont's Democrats since that time have staged an impressive resurgence in Vermont's politics.In 1962, Philip Henderson Hoff (born June 29, 1924) became the first Democrat elected Governor of Vermont in 108 years, and held the office from 1963 to 1969 Today the Democrats have the dominant political party organization in the Green Mountain State, holding every major office at both the federal and state level except for governor. They are currently in coalition with the Vermont Progressive Party, a smaller social democratic party on the left of the Democrats. History The exact date or year the state party was formed is unknown because the state headquarters has not retained archives of historical documents.Appleton, Andrew & Ward, Daniel. \\"State Party Profiles\\". Congressional Quarterly Inc, 1997. p. 332. Prior to 1824, opponents of the Federalist Party were known as Republicans or Democratic-Republicans. After the demise of the Federalists left only one major party, supporters of Democratic-Republicans John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay were largely responsible for founding the Whig Party in the early 1830s as the main opposition to Democratic-Republican Andrew Jackson. In 1830, Vermont newspaper articles still referred to supporters of Andrew Jackson for president in 1832 as Democratic-Republican, or occasionally \\"Democratic\\". By 1831, the name Democratic was used more often as a way to distinguish Jackson and his supporters from the \\"old\\" Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson. By the end of 1831, \\"Democratic\\" was used almost exclusively. Since Vermont was dominated for so long by Republicans, the national Democratic Party paid little attention to Democrats in the state.Appleton, Andrew & Ward, Daniel. \\"State Party Profiles\\". Congressional Quarterly Inc, 1997. p. 330. Democrats usually contested statewide elections, but opposition to Republicans was generally desultory. Democrats filled appointed federal positions such as U.S. Attorney during the administrations of Democratic presidents, and occasionally received appointment to positions that were considered non- partisan, such as Seneca Haselton's tenure as an Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. It wasn't until the 1960s that the Democrats started to pull together an effective statewide organization. Ideology, policies, and party platform =Ideology= Today, the Vermont Democratic party is rooted in progressivism and American liberalism. The state is considered a breeding ground for Progressives and Independents, many of which have close ties to the Vermont Democratic Party. Most Progressives run under the Democratic Party banner in Vermont. =Policies= The Vermont Democratic Party advocates for universal health care, equality for all, and social justice.Vermont Democratic Party Many of the party's proposals have been adopted, including universal health care (Green Mountain Care), same-sex marriage ('gay marriage'), and the closing and de-commissioning of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power station, set to take place in early 2015. The party tends towards environmentalism, favoring measures to protect Vermont's natural resources and ecosystems. Democrats in the state have also called for Vermont to be the first state to use only renewable energy sources. The Party also favors campaign finance reform, but lines up behind the National Party in voicing support for some liberalization of campaign finance regulations so that it may better remain competitive with the Republicans. =Party platform= Documents representing the Vermont Democratic Party's platform have been approved on September 11, 2010 by the party, in 2012, and there is a latest iteration set for approval during late 2014. It conforms very closely to the United States Democratic Party platform, addressing issues such as the economy, the environment, foreign policy, and civil rights. Economic opportunity The primary focus of the Vermont Democratic Party's economic platform rests with keeping businesses owned and operated in Vermont. There should be heavy focus on entrepreneurship and job creation. The party supports a strong and vibrant middle class that encourages youth to pursue careers within the state. Its main focus is economic growth and job creation. The party believes that the state government should make Vermont a desirable place for people to bring,or begin, their businesses. The party plans on doing this by giving financial incentives to businesses that are energy efficient, are located in developing areas within Vermont, and provide workers with a livable wage. The party wants to reverse the Bush tax cuts. It voices support for a graduated income tax; the premise that taxes should be based upon the individual taxpayer's ability to pay them. Under such a system, the wealthy would be taxed at a higher percentage level than the middle class, and the very poor would pay little or no income tax. Environmental issues The party believes a healthy environment is essential to the quality of life and recognizes global climate change as a major problem. The party believes everyone has moral and ethical obligations to protect and conserve the environment. It is committed to the rigorous and consistent enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. It also supports alternative energy, including investments and research, and favors the rapid implementation of 'cleaner' alternatives to oil and other fossil fuels. Vermont Democrats also support laws that places caps, or limits, on the carbon emissions of both public transportation and personal vehicles. Foreign policy The party is opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It believes the decision to go to war was ill-advised and has led to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The party has strongly supported President Obama's decisions to withdraw troops from both Iraq and Afghanistan. Civil rights The Vermont Democratic Party supports equal rights amendments to the Constitution and the protection of all citizens, regardless of race, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, disability, military service, or creed. It has supported Vermont's pioneering initiatives in same-sex marriage, plus the predecessor laws favoring civil unions. It also supports the repeals of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the Defense of Marriage Act. The party also denounces torture and believes all people have due process rights that should never be violated. The party strongly supported President Obama's decision to ban the torturous technique of waterboarding from being used on suspected terrorists. Howard Dean Howard Dean announcing his run for president Howard Dean may be the most nationally renowned Democratic politician to come out of Vermont in recent years. He served as Governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003. In 2004 he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for president. He had a poor showing in many states. The only primary he won was in Vermont. Dean also served as chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009, and is credited with being instrumental in Barack Obama's successful campaign for the presidency in 2008. His Fifty-state strategy is widely considered the reason Obama was able to win in traditionally Republican states. Current elected officials As of late 2020, there are Democratic incumbents holding four of the six statewide offices in the executive branch ‚Äî all but Governor (Republican) and Lieutenant Governor (Progressive) ‚Äî and the Democrats also hold firm majorities in Vermont's Senate and House of Representatives. At the federal level, Democrats hold one of the state's U.S. Senate seats, and Democrats also hold the state's single 'At-Large' seat in the U.S. House of Representatives; the incumbent, Representative Peter Welch, first elected in 2006, was the first Democrat to represent Vermont in the lower chamber of Congress since William H.

History The state of West Virginia granted itself statehood after its people, through a state constitutional convention, became a free state and broke away from the slave holding state of Virginia in 1861 during the first year of the Civil War. Article IV of the U.S. Constitution requires consent of the newly formed state, the original state, and Congress. Since the Virginian government was ruled illegitimate as it was a member of the Confederate States of America, no approval was required and after Congressional consent, self-statehood was gained and political party formation prospered.west Virginia Statehood http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehoo.html The West Virginia Democratic Party was started as a coalition of conservative Pro-Union Democrats, Pro- Confederate Democrats, and former members of the Whig Party. After 1872, its political dominance flourished when restrictions that disenfranchised former Confederates were struck from the state constitution. West Virginia Democrats in government The West Virginia Democratic Party controls only one statewide executive office, the state treasurer, and holds minorities in both the West Virginia House of Delegates and the West Virginia Senate. Democrats hold one of the state's two U.S. Senate seats and none of the state's three U.S. House seats. Incumbent governor Jim Justice was elected as a Democrat in the 2016 election, however switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in August 2017, seven months after taking office. ;State *State Treasurer: John Perdue ;Federal *U.S. Senate **Joe Manchin Democratic electorate Democratic and Republican parties have dominated the American political scene for close to two centuries. One party often overpowers the other and controls the government as a whole. In these times of dominance, the party in power holds a majority of seats at national and state levels and commands the loyalty of the electorate for an extended period of time. In West Virginia, the Republican/ Union supporting party held political power from 1863 to 1872. The Democrats took power in the 1872 elections and held it until 1896. Republicans once again had control in 1872 until 1932. During the Great Depression, The Democratic Party began its dominance that lasted until 2014. =Democratic dominance in West Virginia in the 1900s= From 1930 to 2014, Democrats held majorities in both chambers of the West Virginia Legislature.Brisbin, Richard.

The original version, based on Ubuntu 7.04, was released on 10 May 2007.  Features  =Real-time kernel= The real-time kernel, first included with Ubuntu Studio 8.04, was modified for intensive audio, video or graphics work. The 8.10 Ubuntu Studio release lacks this real-time kernel. It has been reimplemented in the 9.04 Ubuntu Studio release and stabilized with the release of 9.10. 10.04 Ubuntu Studio, in contrast, does not include the real- time kernel by default. As of version 10.10 of the Ubuntu Studio, the real- time kernel is no longer available in the repositories. = Low-latency kernel = As of Ubuntu Studio 12.04, the default kernel is linux-lowlatency, which in essence is a generic Ubuntu Linux kernel, with a tweaked configuration to allow for stable operation for audio applications at lower latencies. Since much of the real-time patch has now been implemented into the vanilla kernel, and considering the difficulties in maintaining linux-rt, Ubuntu Studio decided on using linux-lowlatency in its place. The scheduler allows applications to request immediate CPU time, which can drastically reduce audio latency. In 9.10, the \\"Ubuntu Studio Controls\\" provided under System>Administration permit the user to \\"Enable Nice\\", allowing the use of wireless networking and proprietary graphics cards drivers while maintaining low audio latency free of XRUNs (audio drop-outs) in JACK. A more negative value entered for nice reserves more CPU time for real-time audio processes. =Appearance and sound theme= Ubuntu Studio also includes custom artwork and a blue-on-black theme, as opposed to Ubuntu's default purple and orange. As with the main distribution of Ubuntu, if an accelerated graphics card and appropriate driver are used, the advanced desktop effects can be enabled. More advanced Compiz effects are available in the Synaptic Package Manager (i.e., Ubuntu repositories). In Karmic 9.10, a fresh sound theme replaces the default Ubuntu theme, with a reverberating melody at startup, and an occasional knock or ping from a button or prompt. Xfce (instead of GNOME) is the default user interface. =Access to Ubuntu repositories= An important advantage of Ubuntu Studio over most other Linux distributions employing the real-time kernel is access to the same repositories available to the main Ubuntu distributions through the Update Manager, Synaptic Package Manager, as well as through the Add/Remove Applications prompt. This allows for much more frequent operating system updates, and access to a much wider range of software.  Installation  In the past there has been no live version available of Ubuntu Studio, and no graphical installer. Since the 12.04 release, Ubuntu Studio has been available as a Live DVD.Pleia2, \\"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) Beta 1 Released\\", http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2012/03/01/ubuntu-12-04-lts-precise- pangolin-beta-1-released/, on 3 March 2012 The disk image is about 1.8 GB, too large to fit on a standard CD, and as a result the recommended installation medium for Ubuntu Studio is a DVD or USB flash drive. Ubuntu Studio can also be installed on a pre-existing Ubuntu installation by installing the \\"ubuntustudio-desktop\\" package from Advanced Packaging Tool. In 9.10, the package \\"ubuntustudio-audio,\\" shown during installation (and also available in the Synaptic Package Manager), cannot be installed without a working Internet connection.

He was born in Pakalomattom family, one of the oldest families in Kerala. He was well known as an efficient administrator, deeply religious but was a quiet and reserved person. During his time, a difficult period in the history of Travancore State, the church was able to help Travancore government by depositing an amount as fixed deposit, which came to be known as Vattipanam. Introduction On the South Western coast of India lies a small state known as Kerala It was here in the first century, Thomas the Apostle arrived to preach the gospel to the Jewish community. Some of the Jews and locals became followers of Jesus of Nazareth. They were known as Malabar Nasrani people and their church as Malankara Church. They followed a unique Hebrew-Syriac Christian tradition which included several Jewish elements and Indian customs. In Malankara (Kerala) St. Thomas did not appoint any bishops, but an elder (Mooppen in Malayalam) was selected to lead the people. The parish leader was called Edavaka Mooppen and the church as a whole had a Malankara Mooppen. This was the tradition till 1653. The Malayalam versions of the Canons of the Synod of DiamperFive of the Malayalam versions were available in 1952. use these titles throughout the report except in three places where they use the Latin word archidiaconus.Daniel, K. N. Canons of the Synod of Diamper, prepared using five of the available Malayalam versions.Antonio de Gouvea (1606) Jornada do Arcebispo Aleixo de Menezes quando foy as Serra do Malaubar. There is no chance for the Malankara Church to use this Latin word. Portuguese were not familiar with the Malayalam wording Malankara Mooppen and so they might have used archidiaconus. The Malayalam name Jathikku Karthavian, given by some historians was not used in the Malayalam version of the canons. Early life Mathen was born in Pakalomattom family, one of the oldest families in Kerala. He became a deacon and a priest at a very early age. He was known as Mathen Kathanaar. Consecration Mathen Kathanar was consecrated as his successor by Mar Thoma VI in 1796 at Chengannur church and was given the traditional episcopal title Mar Thoma VII. Vattipanam (Fixed deposit) In 1790, Sakthan Thampuran (1751‚Äì1805), became the ruler of Kochi. He was an efficient ruler. He never encouraged Portuguese Missioners but offered land and other grants to Syrian Christians. His Grants to Syrian Christians paved way for the flourish of Syrian Christians in Trichur District. During his time the business in foreign trade improved. This resulted in more income to the people. Church members gave more to the church. The church made improvements to its buildings. Still the church had more savings. This was the condition of Kochi when Mar Thoma VI was consecrated in 1796. But by 1799, situation in Travancore was different. When Velu Thampi took charge as the Dalawa (prime minister) of Travancore, treasury was empty. At that time Velu Thampi was in good terms with the British. He made an agreement with them. According to that Travancore had to pay a large sum to the British for protection. So the Travancore government was forced to collect more money from its people.Sankunny Menon, P. A History of Travancore from the Earliest Times, p. 251. It was at this time Mar Thoma VI and Mar Thoma VII, discussed what to do with the extra money. They thought of depositing the additional income as a fixed deposit and with the interest they could begin training the priests. While it was going on Mar Thoma VI died on 8 April 1808 at Niranam and Mar Thoma VII was enthroned as the Malankara Metropolitan. Soon after becoming the Metropolitan Mar Thoma VII continued to discuss with Col. Macaulay, the British resident, and the church decided to deposit as loan in perpetuity a sum of 3000 Poovarahan (Market value of a poovarahan, known as Star Pagoda had a market value of Rs 3.50 in 2002).http://www.talentshare.org/~mm9n/articles/Indian%20Christianity/CHAPTER%20TEN.htm The deposit was handed over to Col. Maccaulay on 1 December 1808 and he issued the receipt. The agreement stipulated that interest should be paid to the Malankara Metropolitan. This deposit is now known as Vattipanam.Mathew, P. V. Nazrani Christians of Kerala. (Malayalam), p. 248. Later when there were more than one Metropolitans in Malankara church, it became necessary to decide the rightful authority to receive the interest. So the government convened meetings with the church leaders and according to their decision issued proclamations authorising that person to be the Metropolitan to receive the interest. This continued till the death of Mathews Mar Athanasius in 1877. When dispute arose, government decided that the church should ask the courts to decide to whom the interest is to be paid. Later, In 1889 Royal Court (in Seminary Suit) declared Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Dionysious II as the Malankara Metropolitan and Also in 1928, the High Court of Travancore (in Vattipanam SUIT), declared that Vattasheril Dionysius VI will remain as the Malankara Metropolitan Last days After the enthronement Mar Thoma lived at Puthenkavu (near Chengannur). But soon he moved his headquarters to Kandanad (near Kochi). There he became seriously ill. He did not get time to call a meeting of the church leaders to select his successor. So he invited one of his relatives Thoma Kathanar, to his bed side, laid his hands on him prayed and declared him as Mar Thoma VIII. Two days after this, on 4 July 1809 Mar Thoma VII died and was laid to rest at Kolenchery palli (now known as St. Peter's & St. Paul's Orthodox Church, Kolenchery). The funeral service was conducted by Mar Thoma VIII.

It opened between 1990 and 1992. The centre was rebranded as intu Watford in 2013 following the renaming of its parent Capital Shopping Centres Group as Intu Properties. The building is glass roofed with symmetrical malls. The anchor stores of the centre are a branch of John Lewis (known as Trewins until rebranding in 2001), Debenhams, Apple Store, Marks & Spencer, Zara and Next. History In 1962 there were discussions about development of the site with the plans including a ten-pin bowling alley and 130 flats. The Sainsbury's store on Queen's Road was bought and demolished (1983) to create space for the centre and a warehouse. During the development of the centre, listed high street buildings were renovated and Queen's Road was maintained as a pedestrian cross route through the town. The shopping centre was named and opened by Harlequin Enterprises Ltd (founded 1987, dissolved 2000Companies House WebCheck service, retrieved 6 Jun 2016) in 1990.Intellectual Property Office ref O-346-04 - objection by HEL to the registration of a similar trade mark by Capital Shopping Centres plc The name was a winning entry to a local competition; according to the Watford Observer, the name was probably a reference to the nearby railway line, at the time branded the \\"Harlequin line\\" as it passed through Harlesden and Queen's Park. Watford Council extended a resident parking permit scheme in 1996 to deal with the parking congestion that had arisen since the opening of the Centre. Intu Properties purchased the adjoining Charter Place shopping centre from Watford Borough Council in April 2013. Planning permission was granted in 2014 for Charter Place to be demolished, to make way for a new mixed-use scheme which comprises 16 retail units, a new department store, 11 restaurants and a 9 screen Cineworld cinema, one of which is a high definition IMAX, which will be integrated into the main Intu Watford centre. Demolition work began in November 2015. On September 27, 2018 Debenhams opened a new 86,000 sq ft store in the extension, featuring its first redesigned beauty hall. The 400,000 sq ft extension has increased the total size of the shopping centre to 1.15 million sq ft, making it number 18 in the list of the UK biggest retail destinations. Following Intu Properties plc entering administration in June 2020, a subsidiary of the company called Intu SGS received funding to take full control of the centre along with Lakeside, Victoria Centre and Braehead. The transfer from Intu to Intu SGS is expected to take place by the end of 2020, and will involve Global Mutual becoming asset manager of the centres and Savills serving as property manager.

Heidemann was the 1st round draft choice by the Cleveland Indians in the 1967 Major League Baseball Draft. Baseball career Heidemann attended Brenham High School. Originally drafted 11th overall by the Indians in 1967, he made his debut on May 2, at the age of 19. The sixth youngest player that year in the Majors, he appeared in three games, collected three at-bats and hit .000 in that time. In , as the ninth youngest player in the league, Heidemann-at and 178 pounds-took the starting job at shortstop away from Larry Brown. As the team's starter, he hit only .211 with six home runs, although he did collect a hit in his first at-bat of the season. He was the only starting player not to hit 10 home runs for the 1970 Indians. He kept his job through the season, for the most part. In 81 games that year, he hit only .208 with no home runs and nine RBI. The former first round draft pick obviously wasn't living up to what was expected of him. He was injured for some time during the 1971 season, suffering from a concussion and knee injury. He suffered the concussion on May 17, when Tommy McCraw hit a 140 (one source says 250) foot pop fly that should have been an out. Instead, Heidemann, Vada Pinson and John Lowenstein collided in the outfield, and McCraw actually got an inside-the-park home run. Heidemann played in only 10 games in , relinquishing his starting job to Frank Duffy. In those 10 games, he came to bat 20 times and hit only .150. He did not play any Major League baseball in . Although Heidemann was traded to the Oakland Athletics with Ray Fosse for Dave Duncan and George Hendrick, he was re-signed by the Indians before the 1974 season began. was Heidemann's best season, even though he hit only .247. He started the season out with the Indians, but after collecting only one hit in his first 11 at-bats, he was traded to the Cardinals for Luis Alvarado and Ed Crosby on June 1. His average skyrocketed while with the Cardinals-he hit .271 with them in 47 games. He was traded to the Mets with Mike Vail for Ted Mart√≠nez during the 1974/1975 offseason.Mets, Cardinals trade infielder s Heidemann spent most of on the bench, collecting 145 at-bats in 65 games. He hit .214 with one home run-his first since 1970-and 16 RBI. He started the season with the Mets, but hit only .083 in his first 12 at-bats, so he was traded to the Brewers for minor leaguer Tom Deidel. With the Brewers that year, he hit .219 with two home runs. Overall, he hit .209 that year, collecting 10 RBI. He finished his career in , playing his final game on May 10 of that year. Used almost entirely as a defensive replacement/pinch runner in the five games he played that year, he collected no hits in one at-bat, although he did score a run. Overall, he hit .211 in his career with 9 home runs and 75 RBI. He was a .966 career fielder. He compares most statistically to Alvarado, and he spent 5 seasons with Dick Tidrow, John Lowenstein and Phil Hennigan-longer than any other teammates.

It is the first of four D minor symphonies attributed to Joseph Haydn.  Movements  Scored for two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani,Michael Downey, \\"Review\\" Musical Times 114 1559 (1973): 39. \\"Perger includes timpani in the instrumentation, but Jen√∂ V√©csey, who edited the score (Editio Musica), states that 'there are no kettle drums in the original'.\\" and strings. The bassoons are almost always in unison with the cellos. The Jen≈ë Vecsey edition of 1960 does not show a timpani part, but this is easily enough reconstructed from the trumpet part by tuning the timpani to A and D a fourth apart and using the same rhythms and pitch classes as the trumpets. In three movements: #Allegro brillante #Andantino in B-flat major #Rondeau, #Presto scherzante The first movement, Allegro brillante, is a sonata form that begins with a theme which is basically a D minor scale going up, followed by i and V arpeggiations. The second subject theme uses syncopations and has a dance-like character. The horns are in F, trumpets in D. The second movement, Andantino in B-flat major, gives the ornamented version of the theme first, in the strings. The trumpets in thirds, reinforced by the other winds, then give the unadorned version of the theme. Horns are B-flat basso and trumpets are in B-flat. The third movement is a rondeau, Presto scherzante. Horns are in F, trumpets in D. The A theme could be seen as a metamorphosis of the first subject of the first movement. The final statement of the A theme in D minor is almost the same as the first except the horns are absent while they change crooks to D.J. Murray Barbour. Trumpets, Horns and Music. (East Lansing, Michigan State University Press, 1964), p. 31. \\"But, in general, when the tonic major appeared toward the end of the Finale the horns would change from the relative [major] to the tonic [major] key. This occurred in the D minor Symphonies by Michael Haydn and Ignaz von Becke mentioned above, with the horns changing from F to D.\\" After a fermata on a V7 chord, the A theme is given in D major, the only difference from the first statement being the key signature.

Except for the .244 H&H; Magnum and .257 Weatherby Magnum, it is the smallest caliber factory cartridge derived from the Holland & Holland belted magnum case. It was introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the .338 Winchester Magnum and the .458 Winchester Magnum as one of a family of short-cased belted magnum cartridges developed by Winchester based on the .375 Holland & Holland parent case. It was officially introduced to the public by Winchester in 1959. After many years of dwindling use it began enjoying a mild resurgence in popularity in the mid-2000s among long range rifle enthusiasts and reloaders due to the high ballistic coefficient of the heavier 6.5mm bullets and increasing popularity of cartridges such as 6.5mm Creedmoor, .260 Remington, 6.5 Grendel, benchrest and wildcat cartridges in 6.5mm. Design & specifications Winchester had been manufacturing the shortened Holland & Holland cases under a contract for Weatherby for use in their .257 Weatherby Magnum, .270 Weatherby Magnum and 7mm Weatherby Magnum cartridges. The Weatherby cases had been based on Winchester's .30 Super cartridge. This new series of shortened Holland & Holland cases was based on the .375 Holland & Holland case. The advantages of the shortened case were twofold: the cartridge could function through the standard length rifle action as used by the popular .30-06 Springfield and .270 Winchester. It was also close to the efficiency limitations of powders available at the time given the case capacity of the cartridge. The longer, full length .375 H&H; case would not have resulted in a great performance improvement due to the powders available at that time. It was similar to the reasoning behind the shortened cases used by Weatherby as DuPont's IMR 4350 was the slowest burning powder available then. The .264 Winchester Magnum is a cartridge which was standardized by SAAMI, which published recommended specifications for the cartridge. SAAMI recommends a six groove barrel with a rate of twist of one revolution in , a bore diameter of and a groove diameter of with each groove having a width of . The recommended maximum pressure for the cartridge (piezo) is . Performance The .264 Winchester Magnum gained a reputation as a very flat shooting cartridge. When introduced, it was first chambered in the Winchester Model 70 Westerner rifle, which was intended for longer range shooting more common in the Western United States. At present Remington, Winchester, HSM, and DoubleTap Ammunition produce ammunition for this cartridge. Manufacturers offer a bullet at . This ammunition has a maximum point blank range of when sighted in at . Some ammunition offers premium Nosler Partition and Accubond bullets driven at and through a barrel. While readily available factory ammunition for the cartridge is for the most part fairly basic, handloaders can gain a step up in performance with bullets with better ballistic coefficients and weights to extend the performance of the cartridge. For this reason, this cartridge is better suited for shooters who are willing to make their own ammunition rather than those who purchase over the counter ammunition. Reception The .264 Winchester Magnum main competition comes from the various 7mm cartridges such as the 7mm Remington Magnum, 7mm Weatherby Magnum, the .270 Winchester Short Magnum, .270 Weatherby Magnum, 6.5mm Remington Magnum and the .257 Weatherby Magnum cartridges in North America and the cartridges such as the 6.5√ó68mm in Europe. Due to the over crowded nature of the market in which the cartridge competes, popularity has been on the wane. In particular, the 7mm Remington Magnum release in 1962 led to the cartridge's poor reception by the shooting public. The 7mm Remington Magnum shoots almost as flat as the .264 Winchester Magnum but launches a larger diameter, heavier bullet generating more energy than the .264 Winchester Magnum. Furthermore, the 7mm Remington Magnum benefits from a vast range of compatible bullets due in large part to the popularity of the 7mm caliber while the .264 was something of an oddity and a rather new caliber in North America. Ballistically it is almost identical to the 6.5√ó68mm (also known incorrectly as the 6.5√ó68 RWS, 6.5√ó68 Sch√ºler or the 6.5√ó68 Express Vom Hofe) and the 6.5√ó63 Messner Magnum. The .264 Winchester Magnum is an excellent, potentially accurate, very flat-shooting cartridge capable of taking any game in the lower 48 US states, and one of the most powerful of all cartridges. When loaded with bullets at a muzzle velocity of it is an adequate round for deer out to beyond provided that the hunter is capable of such longer shots. Background The .264 Win. Mag., like many magnum rounds, can wear out barrel throats more rapidly than lower pressure and lower velocity non-magnum cartridges, especially when fired rapidly, which heats up the steel and hastens throat erosion. Throat erosion is greater in higher chamber pressure overbore cartridges. This was particularly true in the 1950s to early 1960s, with the chrome moly steels almost universally used for barrels then. But recent advances with stainless steel barrels, especially with cryogenic treatment, have extended barrel life considerably with the .264 Win. Mag. and many other cartridges. While very few production line riflemakers currently offer the .264 Win. Mag. as a factory chambering, the caliber remains popular with some enthusiasts using custom built rifles and handloading their own ammunition, as an internet search shows. As of 2018 and 2019, Winchester is once again producing its M70 bolt-action rifle in .264 Winchester Magnum. The introduction of Remington's 7 mm Magnum in 1962 almost immediately eclipsed the .264 Win. Mag., even though the 264 Win. Mag. uses an identical brass cartridge case (the neck diameter of either cartridge case can easily be modified to accept the others' bullets by the handloader), it never fully recovered from the competition of the slightly larger-bore cartridge.2002, Lyman's Reloading Handbook, 48th Edition.264 Winchester Magnum info and loading data from Accurate Powder The fact that the 7 mm Rem. Mag. thoroughly eclipsed its popularity has been attributed to many causes, the premature \\"burning out\\" of barrels as compared to the Remington cartridge often cited. More likely is the fact that hunters had more confidence in the game-getting ability of heavier 7 mm (.284\\") 150 to 175 grain spitzer-shaped projectiles on big game, as compared to 140 grains being the upper end of pointed .264 bullets. Conversely, Winchester marketed the .264 as a long range, combination varmint and deer round, although suited for harvesting elk or moose. Unfortunately, the recoil it generates, plus the expense of the sheer quantity of ammo that may be used to shoot pests at long range (compared to pure varmint cartridges like the .222 Remington and the .220 Swift, or the smaller varmint / deer rounds, like the .243 Winchester) inhibited its popularity further. The result was more sportsmen opting for the bigger Remington 7 mm round because it was seen as more effective on a wider variety of big game; rather than a compromise round that could be used for varmints, worked well on whitetail and mule deer, but was borderline for the largest North American big game when the need arose. In Europe, two of the .264 Win. Mag.'s champions were George Swenson of John Wilkes gunmakers, London, and David Lloyd of Northampton, England. Lloyd built a number of his deluxe Lloyd rifles in .264 Win Mag, mainly for sportsmen seeking a cartridge that would give high velocity performance with bullets heavier than the 100 grains fired by the .244 H&H; Magnum.

It was developed by V. VanRheenen, R. C. Kelly and D. Y. Cha of the Upjohn Company in 1976. It is a catalytic system using N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) as stoichiometric re-oxidant for the osmium tetroxide. It is superior to previous catalytic methods. center Prior to this method, use of stoichiometric amounts of the toxic and expensive reagent osmium tetroxide was often necessary. The Upjohn dihydroxylation is still often used for the formation of cis-vicinal diols; however, it can be slow and is prone to ketone byproduct formation. One of the peculiarities of the dihydroxylation of olefins is that the standard \\"racemic\\" method (the Upjohn dihydroxylation) is slower and often lower yielding than the asymmetric method (the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation).  Improvements to Upjohn dihydroxylation  In response to these problems, Stuart Warren and co-workers employed similar reaction conditions to the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, but replacing the chiral ligands with the achiral quinuclidine to give a racemic reaction product (assuming an achiral starting material is employed). This approach takes advantage of the fact that when using the Sharpless alkaloid ligands, the dihydroxylation of alkenes is faster and higher yielding than in their absence. This phenomenon became known as \\"ligand accelerated catalysis\\", a term coined by Barry Sharpless during the development of his asymmetric protocol.

Caipirinha is by far the most popular and internationally well-known. Caipirinha The Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail made with cacha√ßa, ice, sugar, and lime. It is the drink most commonly associated with cacha√ßa. In Brazil, other versions of caipirinha are made with different alcoholic beverages or fruits. A caipiroska or caipivodka is made with vodka instead of cacha√ßa, while a caipir√≠ssima is made with rum and a sakerinha, with sake. Different from the mojito, the caipir√≠ssima is made with crushed lime (not lime juice), and has no mint or soda water. If other fruit is used instead of lime, it is usually called a batida or caipifruta. Batida Batida is a Brazilian cocktail made with the national alcoholic drink cacha√ßa. In Portuguese, batida means shaken or milkshake. It is made with cacha√ßa, fruit juice (or coconut milk), and sugar. It can be blended or shaken with ice. In Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, batidas are traditionally served with feijoada. A variation is made adding sweet condensed milk or sour cream. The most common fruit used in a Batida are lemon, passion fruit and coconut. Rabo-de-galo Rabo-de-galo, which means \\"cock tail\\" (in Brazilian Portuguese cocktail is called coquetel), is a Brazilian drink made of cacha√ßa and red vermouth. The history of the Rabo de Galo dates back to 1950s and the inauguration of the Cinzano factory in S√£o Paulo, it is also known as Tra√ßado, the Portuguese word for mixed. Alternatively, is known as a mixture of \\"everything you have in the bar\\" in some places. It is questionable whether the proportions in rabo-de- galo have ever been formally established. Most bartenders will simply \\"eyeball\\" the two ingredients, adjusting the proportions to the customer's taste. A quite common version calls for 2/3 of cacha√ßa and 1/3 of vermouth. Rabo-de-galo is usually served straight up in large shot glasses. A popular variation in S√£o Paulo, Brazil substitutes the vermouth with Cynar, an Italian bitter ap√©ritif liqueur flavored with artichoke. Caju Amigo (Friendly Cashew) Caju Amigo, also known as Cajuzinho (Little Cashew), is a Brazilian drink made of cacha√ßa and cashew juice. In some places, a slice of cashew is put in the drinker's mouth with a little bit of salt, chewed without swallowing, and a shot of cacha√ßa is thrown back straight- swallowing the fruit and the drink at the same time. Quent√£o (Hot Stuff) Quent√£o, which means \\"very hot\\" or \\"big hot one\\", is a hot Brazilian drink made of cacha√ßa and spices. It is often served during the celebrations known as Festas Juninas. The sugar is first caramelized with spices (whole cloves, cinnamon sticks and ginger chunks) and citrus peels (orange and lime). This mixture is then boiled with water for 10 minutes. The cacha√ßa is added and boiled for another 5 minutes. It is very common in southernmost parts of Brazil to use red wine instead of cacha√ßa, the primary ingredient of Quent√£o, since this region is the largest wine producer in Brazil. As the name suggests, it's meant to be served hot - ideally to be served outside on social gatherings on cold nights, near a fireplace. The ginger also adds to the sensation of warmth in the drink. The gingery flavor should be very distinctive, high notes of cloves must be present also. Nutmeg is an optional ingredient, used in some recipes. Leite de On√ßa (Jaguar Milk) Leite de on√ßa (Jaguar milk) is a cold Brazilian drink made of cacha√ßa and condensed milk. It is very sweet and has a very suave scent that evokes the homely atmosphere of a Festa Junina. It is not easy to replace the ingredients and achieve a similar result because its taste is very peculiar. It is usually served cold, in plain mugs, without garnish (though often cinnamon or chocolate powder is sprinkled over) so that it looks like milk at a first glance. Macuna√≠ma The Macuna√≠ma is a cocktail made with cacha√ßa, sugar syrup, lime, and Fernet-Branca. It is shaken and served straight up in a \\"barriquinha\\", americano glass (a traditional Brazilian glass), or an old fashioned glass. Created by Arnaldo Hirai from Boca de Ouro bar in 2014, it is named after the famous novel Macuna√≠ma by M√°rio de Andrade. Royce (Shaken) Royce is an American cocktail made with the Brazilian national spirit cacha√ßa. This cocktail was named in honor of Royce Gracie, a great Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter.

It was first mentioned in historical documents from 1275, and obtained its city charter in 1325. At that time was one of major urban centers of northern Lesser Poland. The most important sight in Chƒôciny is the royal castle built in the late 13th or early 14th century on the Castle Hill above the town. It fell into a ruin in the 18th century and remains in that state to this day. For centuries Chƒôciny (or Chentshin) had a Jewish community and it had been the center of the Hasidic Chentshin dynasty, (Chƒôciny being pronounced as \\"Chentshin\\" or \\"Khantchin\\" in Yiddish.)  Location and name  Chƒôciny is located in Lesser Poland, and for centuries it belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship. The distance to Kielce is . The town lies among the hills of western ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains, and is an important center of building materials, where the so-called Chƒôciny Marble is excavated. The town does not have a rail station, the nearest one is away in Radkowice. Chƒôciny is served by Kielce's mass transit system, and east of the town goes Expressway S7. With the ruins of the castle and Jaskinia Raj nearby, Chƒôciny is an important tourist center. There are several tourist trails, marked by different colors (red, blue and yellow).  History  Panorama of town The town is first mentioned in historical documents from 1275. It obtained its city charter in 1325. At that time Chƒôciny was an important urban center, where in May 1331 King Ladislaus I of Poland (Polish: W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åokietek) organized a meeting of Lesser Poland's and Greater Poland's nobility, to discuss the oncoming war with the Teutonic Knights. In 1465 Chƒôciny burned in a great fire, the same happened again in 1507. In the 16th century Chƒôciny was a local center of mining and commerce, with its marble famous across the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It also was a center of Protestant Reformation. Chƒôciny was partially destroyed in the Zebrzydowski Rebellion, but real destruction came during the Swedish invasion in 1655 ‚Äì 1660. On April 1, 1657 the town was completely destroyed by the Transilvanians of George II Rakoczi. In 1660 there were only 48 houses, out of 341 in 1655. In 1764 Chƒôciny was designated as legal center for northern Lesser Poland, for Radom, Chƒôciny and Opoczno counties. In 1795 the town was annexed by the Austrian Empire, and next year, the seat of the county was moved to Kielce. Most of this time, Jews were not permitted to live in Kielce, and had to find dwellings in nearby towns. By 1827 the (1740) Jews were 70% of the population. 70 years later they were 4,361, still 70%. A series of fires and recessions caused the Jewish population to dwindle to 61% in 1905, with 3,414 Jewish residents. By the end of World War I only 512 homes stood erect, and by 1921 there were only 2,825 Jewish residents, a mere 51%, living along the main road and around the town center. An account from the period depicts the town as being extremely unclean. At the end of 1939, after the invasion of Poland, a Judenrat and the Jewish Ghetto Police was established by the Nazi German occupiers. In the spring of 1940 several dozen Jews from the new ghetto were murdered in a forest on the outskirts of town. In June 1940 there were approximately 2,800 local Jews and another 1,000 refugees remaining in the ghetto. In January 1941 the Germans planned to move 5,000 Jews from the Kielce Ghetto to Chƒôciny in exchange for 2,500 Polish forced-labourers, but due to a typhus epidemic in the town, this plan was postponed. On July 5, 1941 the order was given to establish the ghetto and by July 22 it was resettled during the Jewish \\"3 weeks of mourning\\". The ghetto had no walls, due to a shortage in materials. Some 500 Jews mostly from poor families, were chosen by the Judenrat, under German orders and sent to the HASAG labour camp in April 1942. In June another 105 Jews were rounded up to be sent to the HASAG camps, but vanished, and were probably shot. 919 Jews from Luposzno were brought to the town in September 1942, and small groups of Jews were brought in from other nearby cities, with the population rising 4000. Under the orders of Gerulf Mayer, the local Gendarme commander, the ghetto was liquidated on September 12. The Jews were chased to the market square and marched to the Wolice train station away, where they were sent to the Treblinka death camp. Dozens were shot on the way during the assembly and march. 40 Jews \\"unfit for travel\\" remained in the ghetto and were shot on the 14th, two days later. A second group of 30 Jews from the Judenrat and other officials was left to search for valuables and bring them to the remaining synagogue. Some of these Jews escaped, the rest were killed in December by the Gendarmes.Virtual Shtetl The US Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos vII-A, page 207 (including image of Judenrat). ‚Äì written according to the (Yiddish) Yizkor book, summing up personal memories.  Points of interest  Chƒôciny seen from the castle View at Chƒôciny One of three castle towers * Royal Castle ‚Äì The construction of the fortress probably began around the 13th or 14th century. Around this date the upper part of the castle, consisting of the upper courtyard with housing unit and two rounded defensive towers, was built. The castle had its own chapel, located by the eastern tower. The castle treasure was being kept in the room above the chapel. It is certain that the castle existed in 1306, when King Ladislaus I presented it to the Archbishop of Krak√≥w, Jan Muskata. In following years a dispute on ownership title of then Lesser Poland has been raised between the king and the bishop. As a result of the dispute, after detection of a plot against the royal power, the castle was returned to the king. King Ladislaus soon made the royal castle in Chƒôciny the centre of his political and military power. In 1318 the treasure of the Archdiocese of Gniezno was transferred and hidden inside the castle to prevent it from being captured by Teutonic Knights. The castle played a significant role as a place of concentration of Polish troops departing for Battle of P≈Çowce with the Teutonic Knights in 1331. In the first half of the 14th century the stronghold was enlarged by King Casimir III the Great. Then the lower courtyard with a rectangle tower was constructed, forming the existing shape of the castle. At that time Chƒôciny became a residence of the king's second wife Adelaide of Hesse. It was also a residence of Elisabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary, Sophia of Halshany and her son W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Varna and Italian by origin ‚Äì Polish Queen Bona Sforza, who departed Poland in 1556. Later it was used for many years as a state prison with main dungeon located underneath the eastern tower. Among imprisoned here were: Michael K√ºchmeister von Sternberg future Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Andrzej Wingold, King Jogaila's half-brother. The castle briefly regained its former glory due to reconstruction initiated by Stanis≈Çaw Branicki, Starost of Chƒôciny. However, in the second half of the 16th century, the castle began to decline. In 1588 the parliament ordered to transfer the castle's inventories to the Chƒôciny Parish Church. In 1607 the Castle was captured and burned by the Zebrzydowski Rebellion. In 1657 the Castle was again partially destroyed by the Rakoczy troops. During the Swedish Deluge the Castle turned into a ruin and remains in that state to this day. The ruins of the Castle have been preserved several times. First major construction works were undertaken in 1877. Between First and Second World Wars the castle was preserved by then mayor of the city Edmund Padechowicz. After the Second World War the castle was again preserved and partially reconstructed with middle tower rebuilt. Since then the eastern tower serves as a scenic viewpoint. * The Parish Church of St Bartholomew is located at the rock terrace cut in the slope of the Zamkowa Mountain, above sea level. It was probably founded by Ladislaus I. The construction was started around 1315 and was finished in the times of King Casimir the Great. In 1568‚Äì1603 it served The Polish Brethren ‚Äì members of the Minor Reformed Church of Poland, a Nontrinitarian Protestant church that existed in Poland from 1565 to 1658. Brethren were popularly known as \\"Arians\\" or \\"Socinians\\" and after their expulsion from Poland, \\"Unitarians\\". The church gained its contemporary appearance during the last alteration in the years 1830‚Äì40. The Gothic character is preserved mainly in the stockade-like window shape, but the roofs were lowered and the tower was built. The triple-nave, hall church has an entrance leading through the vestibule from the 17th century with a tunnel vault. The side naves are based on octagonal pillars. The early Baroque altar was consecrated in 1628. The stalls surrounding the presbytery and those on the back side of the church come from the late Renaissance and were originally placed at the Franciscan monastery. A Renaissance Fodygas-Family chapel was built in 1614 by Swiss by origin ‚Äì Kacper Fodyga (Gasparre Fidigga) right at the chancel. In the tomb the mummified bodies of miner and alderman of Chƒôciny ‚Äì Kacper as well as his wife Zuzanna of Grodzianowice are buried. * Franciscan monastery complex is an interesting place. It was established In the second half of the 14th century. It was founded by King Casimir the Great in 1368. The church is built of stones in the gothic style. The whole courtyard is surrounded by buildings and stone-wall from the 17th century. In 1465 the church was burned with the majority of house estates. Between 1581‚Äì1603 the temple, captivated by Protestants, was seriously devastated. After the reconstruction undergone by the starost Stanis≈Çaw Branicki the monastery was again destroyed by the troops of George II R√°k√≥czi, who, plundered the monastery in search of treasure, murdered three monks, which is commemorated on the marble plaque inside. Another difficult time was the expulsion of the monks during the reign of Tsar Alexander I Then the monastery was turned into one of the strictest prisons in the ≈õwiƒôtokrzyskie mountains. Later, the building was used as public lavatory and tourist shelter. In the 1960s, the complex was restored and adapted for tourist purposes: the church housed the restaurant and the hotel. Despite continuing protests addressed to the then communist government party and state, this state lasted 19 years. In 1991, the monastery was turned back to the Franciscans. * Niemczowka tenement house built in the Renaissance style, in the terrace building development, with the spacious transit entrance hall. It belonged to Walenty and Anna Niemiec Wrzesie≈Ñ. It was built in 1570. In the past it was an inn. On the ground floor in the big room there is a three-piece window with Renaissance columns, and also the ceiling joist, on which there is the date 1634 and the surname of the contemporary chƒôci≈Ñski mayor Walenty Soboniewski.

In 1657, after it was partially destroyed by the troops of R√°k√≥czi the building was reconstructed and refurbished. In 1700 the entrance to the prayer chamber was lowered with a new door portal placed founded by noble and affluent members of the Jewish community. New interior paintings were added in the 19th century. In 1905 the building was again partially destroyed with a fire. In 1906 due to the funds of the Jewish community the synagogue was renovated with a new roof, staircase and interior paintings. During the II world war the interior was completely demolished by the Nazi soldiers. After the war it served as the public library and cinema. In 1958 the roof was reconstructed and synagogue was refurbished to house the local cultural centre. In 1991‚Äì1992 some works were also done mainly with respect to the floor, walls and main entrance door. The synagogue was built on a rectangular plan in the late Renaissance style. The building is covered with a Polish-style shake roof. The windows are framed with a late Renaissance stone frames. The corners of the building are reinforced with buttresses.

Traditional dairy farming operations around Harvard, Illinois have not overloaded the creek's biotic capacity. However, exponential residential development starting in the 2000s is expected to present new challenges to the creek. The land around Piscasaw Creek is relatively flat and does not slope much. Much of the creek is bordered by strips of damp soil and wetland, with cattails and willow trees. The wetlands have helped to maintain water quality. The Piscasaw Creek watershed, including its tributaries, drains over of land, making it the fourth largest tributary of the Kishwaukee River. In 2008 the Illinois Natural History Survey examined Piscasaw Creek at two different sites in McHenry County's Beck's Woods. At site one the creek was 12 meters (m) wide and 20 centimeters (cm) deep. The river bed had a substrate of cobble and the stream at that site consisted entirely of riffles. At site number two the creek was 10 m wide and 30 cm deep, this area was also dominated by riffles.Illinois Natural History Survey Technical Report, 2008, Illinois Natural History Survey, via the Illinois Department of Transportation, January 18, 2008, pp. 20-21, accessed January 27, 2011.

Brown trout populations are most likely natural, since no stocking efforts were made. Both species are known to breed successfully, though the overwhelming populations of various chub and sucker often deter most fisherman from consistently fishing it. In total, 46 species of fish have been documented in Piscasaw Creek. Aside from fish, 17 species of mussel have been collected from the creek. Reptiles and amphibians in and around the Piscasaw include the green frog, ornate box turtle, northern leopard frog, fox snake, Chicago garter snake and the plains garter snake. Multiple state and federal endangered and threatened species have been identified within the Piscasaw Creek area.

The film follows a group of residents of Berlin on a summer's day during the interwar period. Hailed as a work of genius, it is a pivotal film in the development of German cinema and Hollywood.Berlin film festival website The film features the talents of Curt Siodmak (story), Fred Zinnemann (cinematography) and Eugen Sch√ºfftan, who had developed the Sch√ºfftan process for three years earlier. Production The film is subtitled \\"a film without actors\\" and was filmed on Sundays in the summer of 1929. The actors were amateurs whose day jobs were those that they portrayed in the film‚Äîthe opening titles inform the audience that these actors have all returned to their normal jobs by the time of the film's release in February 1930. They were part of a collective of young Berliners who wrote and produced the film on a shoestring. This lightly scripted, loosely observational work of New Objectivity became a surprise hit. People on Sunday is notable for its portrayal of daily life in Berlin before Adolf Hitler became chancellor and as an early work by writer/director Billy Wilder before he moved to the United States to escape from Hitler's Germany. The film is the directorial debut of the Siodmak Brothers. The film was co- produced by Moriz Seeler, founder of the Filmstudio 1929 production company and Seymour Nebenzal, cousin to the Siodmaks, whose father Heinrich put up the money. The film began a 30-year collaborative friendship between Nebenzal and Wilder. Siodmak called it \\"a nice little film\\" and said Wilder only worked on the movie \\"a couple of minutes\\" contributing some ideas.Encounter with Siodmak, Taylor, Russell. Sight and Sound; London Vol. 28, Iss. 3, (Summer 1959): 180. Plot The film opens at Bahnhof Zoo train station one Saturday morning. Its opening scenes show the bustling traffic of central Berlin. The movie follows five central characters over a weekend. Wolfgang (Wolfgang von Waltershausen), a handsome young man, sees a pretty woman (Christl Ehlers) who seems to be waiting in the street for someone who has not arrived. He takes her for an ice cream, teases her about having been stood up and invites her to a picnic the following day. Erwin (Erwin Splettst√∂√üer) is doing his day job as a taxi driver. While he is fixing the car, his depot receives a phone call from his girlfriend, Annie (Annie Schreyer), who wants to know if they are going to the cinema that evening. Erwin clearly is not keen to go. (One of the motifs of the movie is to play down the importance of the cinema in the lives of these young Berliners.) At the end of the day, Erwin returns home to find Annie moping about in their threadbare apartment. The couple bicker continually as they prepare to go to the cinema. The first row is over the pictures of movie stars in their bathroom. Annie cherishes the pictures of various actors while Erwin enjoys the photos of actresses, and the couple tear up each other's pictures during the squabble. Another argument arises over whether Annie should wear the brim of her hat up or down. (Another theme of the movie is the self-centred machismo represented by Erwin and Wolfgang.) Wolfgang arrives in the middle of this argument and Annie never gets to the cinema; Erwin and Wolfgang drink beer instead and plan to go to the countryside the following day. The next morning, the two men take a train to Nikolassee, accompanied by Christl and her friend Brigitte (Brigitte Borchert). Annie stays home, sleeping away the day. The four daytrippers walk to Wannsee, along with many other Berliners, to enjoy the beaches and parks. As the four friends have a picnic, swim in the lake and play records on a portable gramophone, Wolfgang flirts with Brigitte, to the annoyance of Christl. He later play-chases Brigitte into the forest, where they find a secluded spot and make love. Afterwards, the four friends take a boat-ride, during which Erwin and Wolfgang flirt with two girls who are in a rowing boat. As they head back into Berlin, Brigitte suggests to Wolfgang that they meet again the following Sunday. He agrees, but Erwin reminds him afterwards that they had planned instead to attend a football match. Wolfgang's decision remains unresolved. Erwin returns to find Annie still lying in bed, slowly waking up to realize this was the day for their excursion. Erwin angrily shows her what time it is. The final scene returns to shots of the streets of Berlin. The closing series of intertitles announces: \\"And then on Monday...it is back to work... back to the everyday... back to the daily grind... Four... million... wait for... the next Sunday. The end.\\". Cast * as himself (taxi driver) - The five leading actors were all amateur actors. Like his film figure, Splettst√∂√üer was also a taxi driver in real life. He liked acting and appeared later in small roles in two other films also directed by Robert Siodmak: Abschied (1930) and Voruntersuchung (1931). In an unfortunate accident, he was run over by his own taxi in 1931 and died. * as herself (record seller) - Like her film figure, Brigitte Borchert (born 1910) also worked as a Gramophone seller when she was discovered for this film. It was her only film role; she later married the illustrator Wilhelm M. Busch in 1936. In 2000, Brigitte Borchert appeared in Weekend am Wannsee, a documentary film about People on Sunday. Brigitte Borchert died as a centenarian in Hamburg-Blankenese in August 2011, aged 100 years. * as himself (wine seller) - Wolfgang von Waltershausen (born 1900; died 1973) came from a wealthy family in Bavaria. He was a descendant of Georg Friedrich Sartorius. Waltershausen later had small roles in two other movies.

Four well-known actors of the Weimarer Republic appear in small roles: * Kurt Gerron as himself * Valeska Gert as herself * Heinrich Gretler as himself * Ern√∂ Verebes as himself Reception Contemporary critics regarded the movie as an accurate and laconic portrayal of the Berlin they knewCITYGIRLS_s035_060(21.01.) and saw the closing intertitles as an accurate claim that these characters represent ordinary real-life Berliners. In retrospect, these closing words have gained an ironic poignancy in light of the later horrors of Nazi Germany. Revivals In the autumn of 2002, Menschen am Sonntag was presented at one of Berlin's popular Jewish Culture Days. The Berlin-based Eastern European group Trio Bravo+ was commissioned to produce a new silent movie score for the film, which proved highly successful and was subsequently released as a standalone soundtrack CD.Trio Bravo+ website} In 2005, the Netherlands Film Institute released an updated DVD of the film, restoring some missing scenes and commissioning a new score from Elena Kats-Chernin. This is the version used by the British Film Institute as the basis for its own DVD entitled People on Sunday, released 25 April 2005.BFI DVD People on Sunday The Criterion Collection released their edition of Menschen am Sonntag on Blu-ray and DVD in the United States on June 28, 2011, with a score by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, and the Elena Kats-Chernin soundtrack as an alternate.

We are here to confederate the workers of this country into a working class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working class...\\"The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 181. Preparation of 1905 convention The first step towards the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World had already been taken in the fall of 1904 in an informal conference of six leaders in the socialist and labor movement: William Trautmann, George Estes, W. L. Hall, Isaac Cowen, Clarence Smith, and Thomas J. Hagerty. Others, including Eugene V. Debs and Charles O. Sherman, cooperated with them without being present at this meeting. These men shared the conviction that the existing American labor unions were unable to achieve real benefits for the workers. Some, such as the American Federation of Labor, were conservative and \\"aristocratic\\". Others, including the American Labor Union (ALU), the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) and the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance (STALA), were ineffective in negotiating with employers for other reasons, such as a lack of solidarity and cooperation.Brissenden 1919, pg. 57-58 The WFM had recently been damaged by government intervention and vigilantism during the Colorado Labor Wars. Those at the informal conference decided to arrange a larger meeting to be held on January 2, 1905 in Chicago, to which about 30 people were invited. This secret conference - known as the January conference - was attended by 23 individuals, formally representing 9 organizations. The conference wrote a manifesto, which indicted the existing American labor movement - especially the craft form of organization; proposed plans for a new form of labor organization; and called for a convention to organize that new labor union. A founding convention was to be held again in Chicago on June 27. The manifesto was signed by all who were present at the January conference and sent to all unions in America as well as the industrial unions in Europe.Brissenden 1919, pg. 59-67 1905 convention The 1905 convention of the IWW was attended by 203 radical trade unionists representing 43 organizations, which covered a wide range of occupations. 70 delegates from 23 organizations were authorized to install their organizations in the industrial union which was to be founded at the convention. 72 additional delegates from the other 20 organizations were only present to take notes on the proceedings and report back. The other 61 delegates did not represent any organization. Only the delegates who were empowered to install an organization in the IWW were given votings rights proportional to the number of members of their organization - the other delegates had only one vote each.Brissenden 1919, pg. 67-73 Of the labor unions represented at the convention, sixteen were at the time affiliated with the AFL. These were, however, mostly local unions with little strength in numbers. Only five of the organizations affiliated with the AFL were represented by delegates with instructions to install them in the proposed labor union. Hence, these unions played only a minor role at the meeting.Brissenden 1919, pg. 71-71 The 23 labor unions that sent a delegate with instructions to install them, had a total membership of 51,430. The total membership of the other 20 organizations was 91,500; this means that about one third of the membership represented at the convention held almost the entire voting power. Of the over 51,000 votes aggregated by those organizations prepared to install, 48,000 were distributed among five organizations: the Western Federation of Miners (27,000 members), American Labor Union (16,750 members), United Metal Workers (3,000 members), United Brotherhood of Railway Employees (2,087 members), and the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance (1,450 members). Only a few organizations thus held almost all the power at the convention. The first two labor unions listed above outnumbered all others ten to one.Brissenden 1919, pg. 73-75  Notes   References  * External links * http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/unions/iww/1905/convention/index.htm Category:History of the United States (1865‚Äì1918) Category:Industrial Workers of the World in Illinois Category:1905 in Illinois Category:Progressive Era in the United States Category:1905 conferences Category:History of the Industrial Workers of the World ","title":"First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World"},{"id":"9429353","text":"Levine Museum of the New South The Levine Museum of the New South, is a history museum located in Charlotte, North Carolina whose exhibits focus on life in the North Carolina Piedmont after the American Civil War.

He was the Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan for the constituency of Assiniboia-Gravelbourg, from 1988 until 1991.  Early life  Wolfe was born in Rockglen, Saskatchewan on May 2, 1955, and was raised on the Wolfe family ranch within the Killdeer, Saskatchewan district west of Rockglen. He attended school at Killdeer before completing high school in Rockglen. He studied biology at the University of Saskatchewan and in 1979 he graduated with distinction from the Western College of Veterinary Medicine.  Professional career  Wolfe practiced as a veterinarian in Alberta for one year before returning to his home in Rockglen, Saskatchewan, where he ran the Borderland Veterinary Clinic with his wife, Dr. Gail Snyder, whom he had married on January 26, 1980. Wolfe also worked as a veterinarian for the thoroughbred and standardbred racetracks in Regina and Saskatoon during the racing seasons for several years. He was extensively involved in community economic development projects and was chairman of the first Rural Development Corporation in the province.*Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan - Minutes, February 10, 1995 (PDF)  Political career  Wolfe was elected in a by- election called to replace Liberal party leader and future federal cabinet minister Ralph Goodale, when Goodale retired from provincial politics to run in the 1988 federal election. He served a single term, and was defeated by Lewis Draper of the NDP in the 1991 general election. During Wolfe's term as an MLA in the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan he held several titles, including: * Associate Minister of Health - Oct 3, 1988 to Nov 27, 1990 * Minister of Urban Affairs - Nov 27, 1990 to Jan 1, 1991 * Minister of Community Services - Jan 1, 1991 to Nov 1, 1991 He was also involved with the Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation and the Saskatchewan Housing Corporation from March 16, 1990 to November 1, 1991.  Death  Wolfe died in the early hours of February 2, 1995 due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The father of three‚Äîand soon to be four‚Äîback in his veterinary practice, was anguished at the prospect of being forced to testify against his old friends and ex-colleagues. When told in 1995 that he also potentially faced arrest (charges were never pressed), he shot himself. A former party worker says Jack was an innocent killed by a corrupt system. Jack's wife Gail says her husband's dream of public service was shattered. He was cremated and buried at the Killdeer community cemetery, which happens to sit upon the site of the original Wolfe family homestead, from his grandfather's immigration, and also directly beside the former farmyard in which he spent his early years.

He started his career in the Football League with Charlton Athletic, Millwall, Bury and Southend United, before dropping into non-League football with Hornchurch, Grays Athletic and Rushden & Diamonds. Stuart went on to gain promotion back into the Football League with AFC Wimbledon, before dropping back into non-League with Sutton United and Margate - where he went on to become player/assistant manager. He has also once acted as manager for Grays in the Essex Senior Cup in 2006 and later captained the side, before returning in May 2016 as permanent manager. In 1997, Stuart was sacked by Charlton and served a six-month ban from football for failing a doping test. He was also charged with grievous bodily harm following an incident with Chris Beardsley, in a match with York City in September 2007. He was acquitted of the charges in September 2008. Stuart was player/manager for Grays Athletic from 2016 to 2019. Club career =Charlton Athletic= Stuart started his career at Charlton Athletic, where he rose through the youth system and signed his first professional contract in January 1995. He made his first team debut for Charlton in the 2‚Äì0 defeat against Huddersfield Town in the First Division on 17 August 1996. He went on to make 50 appearances in the Football League, scoring three goals for the \\"Addicks\\". During his time with Charlton Athletic, he earned four international caps playing for the England under-21 team in the Toulon Tournament against France, Brazil, Nigeria and Italy's under-21 teams.

Stuart was allegedly elbowed in the face by Wade Elliott, which resulted in his nose being broken and Stuart reacting by grabbing Elliott's shirt. Referee, Jeff Winter, adjudged Stuart had thrown a punch, whilst Andy Preece criticised Stuart for raising his arms to another player, defended him saying \\"I can't see why he thinks Jamie has punched him in the face...the explanation from the ref doesn't add up with what you see on the video.\\" =Southend United= In June 2003, Stuart then joined fellow Third Division side Southend United for the upcoming 2003‚Äì04 season, saying he wanted to move nearer his family in London. He made his debut in the 3‚Äì0 home defeat against Mansfield Town in League Two on 23 August 2003.

It has a population of 3,743 (2018), and lies in historic Lesser Poland. The name of the town is derived from hop (). History Immaculate Conception church Chmielnik was first mentioned in connection with the Battle of Chmielnik with Mongols and Tatars fought in the area in 1241 (see Mongol invasion of Poland). The Mongols and the Tatars were opposed near the settlement by Polish knights from the provinces of Sandomierz and Krak√≥w. In the town there is a monument dedicated to this battle. At the beginning the settlement was a property of the dukes of Sandomierz, but in the 13th century it became owned by the OdrowƒÖ≈º family. The oldest monument in the town is the Church of Holy Trinity together with a church graveyard from around 1356. Later on Chmielnik belonged to the Ole≈õnicki family who made efforts to grant it town charter. In 1551 Chmielnik was granted Magdeburg town rights by king Sigismund II Augustus, hereby formally becoming a town. In 1580 king Stephen B√°thory granted the town a privilege of organizing more fairs. At the beginning of the 17th century the ownership of the town was transferred to the Go≈Çuchowski family. Monument of Kazimierz Ta≈Ñski at the local cemetery In the 16th and 17th centuries the town was a major centre of Polish Protestants (Calvinists and the Polish Brethren). On the basis of privilege granted by Krzysztof Go≈Çuchowski in the second part of the 17th century the town was populated by Sephardi Jews expelled from Spain. They built a synagogue in 1638 and took over houses and shops of the Polish Brethren expelled from the town in 1658. In 1787 Chmielnik became a property of the Ch≈Çapowski family. After the Third Partition of Poland the town was taken by the Habsburg Empire (1795). In the years 1809‚Äì1815 it was in the Duchy of Warsaw, later in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland (1815‚Äì1915).

After capturing the town in 1939 the Germans slowly discriminated against the Polish and Jewish population, which swelled during the war as Jews fled from other towns arrived at Chmielnik. Over several months Germans transported Jews to concentration camps, mainly Treblinka, where they were exterminated. The Germans also deported over 1,600 people for forced labor, and, still in Chmielnik, carried out executions of Poles and Jews from the town as well as from other places. The Polish resistance movement was active in the area, secret Polish teaching was organized. Just after the war, only four Jewish residents residing in the town had survived. The remaining Holocaust survivors emigrated, mostly to Israel, Canada and the United States.http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Chmielnik/Chmielnik.html Memorial Book of Chmielnik; Annihilated Jewish Community There is renewed interest in Chmielnik's Jewish heritage although no Jew has lived there for decades.http://forward.com/culture/182261/the-resurrection-of-chmielnik The Resurrection of Chmielnik The synagogue has been renovated and transformed into a museum to the memory of the Jews of the region.http://swietokrzyskisztetl.pl/asp/pl_start.asp?typ=14&menu;=3&strona;=1&ref;=1&schemat;=  Sports  Chmielnik is home to a sports club Zenit, established in 1946.

Her father remarried in 1915. Early life and education Margaret Woodrow Wilson (her middle name was her paternal grandmother's surname and father's middle name) was born in Gainesville, Georgia. Both her parents strongly identified with the South, and both of their fathers had been Protestant ministers. Wilson's parents were living in the North where her father was teaching, but her mother did not want her children born as Yankees; Ellen Wilson accordingly arranged to stay with family in Gainesville for the births of her first two daughters. Margaret attended local schools, sometimes associated with the colleges where her father taught during her growing years.

Whereas Examen facultatum aims at teaching students how to write academic texts, Examen philosophicum trains students in philosophy and structured thinking. Introduced at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark‚ÄìNorway in 1675, Examen philosophicum was discontinued in Denmark in 1971 and exists in a reduced version in Norway.  Denmark  Norway Count of Griffenfeld is considered the inventor of Ex.phil. Examen philosophicum as a compulsory course is legally based in royal regulations for each university, for example Regulations of 20 December 2005 No. 1798 on Studies and Exams at the University of Oslo. Both Examen philosophicum and Examen facultatum are compulsory parts of most bachelor's degrees in Norway: mainly professional studies at university colleges and a few natural science studies at universities are exempt from either one or both. The content of Examen philosophicum varies between universities, normally being adapted to the scientific branch of each faculty and on the field of study of each undergraduate programme. For example, students of foreign languages will normally study a variety which is adapted to ditto. In general, Examen philosophicum includes philosophy, ethics, and rhetoric. Introduced in 1675 at the University of Copenhagen, Examen philosophicum was continued by the University of Oslo in 1812, two years before the Dano- Norwegian union was dissolved. It was called andreeksamen (second exam) between 1812 and 1903, contrasting Examen artium as f√∏rsteeksamen (first exam). It was then called forberedende pr√∏ve i filosofi (preparatory test in philosophy) between 1903 and 1967, before ultimately retaining its original name in 1967. Examen philosophicum originally had a duration of two or three semesters, including exams in philosophy, history, mathematics, astronomy, natural sciences, Latin language, Greek language, and‚Äîfor theology students‚ÄîHebraic language. Latin, Greek, and history were dropped in 1845, whilst natural sciences were split into physics and chemistry. Philosophy became the sole field of study in 1875. Under the former cand.mag. system, an Examen philosophicum course was worth 5.0 vekttall, corresponding to a half semester, and along with Examen facultatum, it made up an introductory semester at universities. Later reduced in scope, both Examen philosophicum and Examen facultatum are normally worth 10.0 ECTS each, corresponding to two thirds of a semester.

Its plot concerns a hangman who arrives in a town and executes the citizens one by one. As each citizen is executed, the others are afraid to object out of fear that they will be next. Finally there is nobody remaining in the town except the hangman and the narrator of the poem. The narrator is then executed by the hangman, as by then there is no one left who will defend him. The poem contains four-line stanzas with the rhyming pattern AABB. The poem is usually cited as an indictment of those who stand idly by while others commit grave evil or injustice, such as during the Holocaust. The story it tells is very similar to that of the famous statement First they came... that has been attributed to the anti-Nazi pastor Martin Niem√∂ller as early as 1946. The poem may be interpreted as an attack on McCarthyism, a possibility since the first use of the term \\"McCarthyism\\" came on March 29, 1950, in a political cartoon by Herblock of the Washington Post.

Although small, the breed is agile and hardy. The breed was developed by crossing native mountain horses with a mixture of Central Asian and European bloodlines. History The Lokai was developed in the mountainous areas of central and southern Tajikistan, where it was developed to be an agile, hardy pack and riding horse. The breed has been in development since the 16th century, when Uzbek Lokai tribesmen began improving the local horses with a mixture of Central Asian breeds, including contributions from the Iomud, Karabair, Turkmene and Akhal-Teke breeds. Later, Arabian stallions from Bukhara and Thoroughbred and Tersk horses were used to improve the breed. Breed characteristics The Lokai have well-proportioned heads with straight or slightly convex profiles, set on a long, well-formed neck and sloping, muscular shoulders. The withers are prominent, running into a straight, short back and sloping croup. The legs are solid, clean, and well-muscled. The Lokai generally stands between , and is usually chestnut (often with golden highlights), bay, or gray, although they are occasionally black or dun. Some members of the breed exhibit a curly coat that can be traced to the stallion Farfor, used for breeding from 1955 to 1970. The breed tends to mature late, especially when raised in their native habitats. When bred and reared in good stable conditions, with improved feed and management, they mature faster and grow larger than their more native counterparts. Currently, the Lokai is being crossed with Arabian and Thoroughbred horses to create a new type of saddle horse in Tajikistan.  Uses and purposes  Lokais have been used for a variety of purposes throughout the years.

It lies in Lesser Poland, on the Kamienna river, northwest of Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski. Kun√≥w was granted Magdeburg rights in 1365, stripped of them in 1867, to again become a town in 1990. It is located along the European route E371, and the town has a rail station on the Skar≈ºysko-Kamienna ‚Äì Sandomierz line. In the early Middle Ages Kun√≥w belonged to the Archbishops of Krak√≥w, who had a manor house here. In 1241 the village was raided by the Mongols (see Mongol invasion of Poland), and in 1247 it was destroyed by the army of Prince Konrad Mazowiecki. In 1365 King Kazimierz Wielki granted it town rights, and at that time Kun√≥w was the seat of a parish whose area was . The town belonged to Lesser Poland‚Äôs Sandomierz Voivodeship. In the 15th century powerful Cardinal Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki spent a lot of time in Kun√≥w, which already had a wooden church of St. W≈Çadys≈Çaw. In 1502 the town was completely burned by the Crimean Tatars, and as a result it temporarily lost its Magdeburg rights, regaining the privileges on August 29, 1535. In 1578 Kun√≥w had 65 different artisans, and was famous for its white and red marble, used in construction of several palaces (such as the complex of ≈Åazienki Park in Warsaw). By 1616 the town had 130 houses, a parish school and two churches, however after the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland (1655‚Äì1660), the number of houses was reduced to 63, with a population of 530. After the wars of the 1650s, Kun√≥w's importance declined. In 1705, 560 residents died in an epidemic, and in the late 18th century, after the Partitions of Poland, the town was annexed by the Habsburg Empire. In 1815‚Äì1915 it belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Kun√≥w burned in fires in 1814 and 1818, and in 1860 it had 145 houses with 1,121 inhabitants. During the January Uprising the town was one of centers of the rebellion, here leaders of Polish forces met to discuss their tactics. Kun√≥w, however, lost its importance at the expense of the fast-growing industrial town of Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski, and was stripped of its town rights on June 1, 1869. In the Second Polish Republic Kun√≥w belonged to Kielce Voivodeship, but it stagnated and remained a village. After World War II, Kun√≥w began to develop. Waterworks, new school, library, health center, local government office and post office were opened. Among points of interest there is the parish church of St. W≈Çadys≈Çaw (17th century), with a bell tower (1896). At a church cemetery there are tombs of January Uprising veterans.

The musical tells the story of Greenwich's career and personal life from the 1950s to the 1980s, using songs written or co-written by Greenwich, along with Jeff Barry, Phil Spector, George \\"Shadow\\" Morton, Jeff Kent, and Ellen Foley. The musical was based on an original concept by Melanie Mintz, and the book (referred to as the \\"liner notes\\") was written by Anne Beatts, with additional material by Jack Heifner. The musical had a brief Off-Broadway run in 1984, followed by a 120-performance Broadway run in 1985. The Broadway production had a lengthy preview period, during which the musical was retooled and much of the spoken dialogue was cut, turning Leader of the Pack into more of a revue. In both productions, the young Ellie was played by Dinah Manoff, while Greenwich herself appeared as the older Ellie. Annie Golden and Darlene Love, both of them Greenwich's real-life friends and collaborators, also appeared as themselves. Background Leader of the Pack celebrates the life and times of the Brooklyn-born Greenwich, whose doo-wop sounds skyrocketed to the top of the pop charts in the early to mid-1960s. Beatts' \\"liner notes\\" serve as the book that link the songs and provide a look into the songwriter's professional triumphs and personal misfortunes. Production history The initial presentation of Leader of the Pack: The Songs of Ellie Greenwich (as it originally was titled), with a cast of six, had a brief run at Greenwich Village's The Bottom Line in the winter of 1984. After 53 previews, the much- expanded production, boasting a cast of nineteen directed and choreographed by Michael Peters, opened on April 8, 1985 at the Ambassador Theatre, where it ran for 120 performances. Frank Rich, reviewing the show in The New York Times, called it an \\"embarrassment\\" and later wrote that upon closing, the show's producers engaged each other in litigation that \\"entertained Broadway for far longer than their show had.\\" The production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical, but lost to Big River. Leader of the Pack was unlike other shows on Broadway at the time. Though it ran in two acts, it was without an intermission and had a duration of 90 minutes. Leader of the Pack is a popular choice for high school and amateur productions, which Ellie Greenwich frequently managed and oversaw until her death in August 2009. = 2000 U.S. Tour = A major U.S. tour was produced in 2000‚Äì2001, with new arrangements, orchestrations and musical direction by Nathan Hurwitz, directed by Kurt Stamm, choreography by Scott Wise. The cast included: Shoshana Bean, Brenda Braxton, Dianna Bush, Todd DuBail, Duane Martin Foster, Angela Garrison, Amy Goldberger, David Josefsberg, Joe Machuta, Ric Ryder, Denise Summerford, Jewel Tompkins, Ashley Howard Wilkinson. One reviewer wrote, \\"Brenda Braxton shows her stuff in \\"The Sunshine After the Rain,\\" and Angela Garrison does well with her numbers, including, notably, \\"The First Time.\\" When they finally throw a bone to the men, the guys make the most of it. Ric Ryder and Todd DuBail carry their songs effortlessly. They do have a fine orchestra to work with, and the band, led by Nathan Hurwitz, gets better as the songs get richer.\\" Synopsis =Act 1= Darlene Love, serving as a narrator, welcomes us to the 1980s and the still-present popularity of songs from the 1960s (‚Äò‚ÄôBe My Baby‚Äô‚Äô). Darlene then takes us back to a simpler time, the 1960s, and the music of that period as well (‚Äò‚ÄôWait ‚Äòtil My Bobby Gets Home‚Äô‚Äô). Enter Ellie Greenwich, a teenage girl living in Levittown, New York. She dreams of her own musical success, but is sidelined by her mother who wishes for her to pursue a degree in education. (‚Äò‚ÄôA‚Ä¶My Name Is Ellie‚Äô‚Äô). In Ellie‚Äôs spare time, she formed a trio with her two best friends, Shelley and Mickey, called the Jivettes. The Jivettes are given a chance to record a single at the Brill Building, which they believe could be their big break. (‚Äò‚ÄôJivette Boogie Beat‚Äô‚Äô) Fast forward a few years later where Ellie, now finished with school, attempts to get job writing at the Brill Building. There she meets a fellow writer, Jeff Barry, and Gus Sharkey, a music producer (in the vein of Phil Spector). Despite skepticism from Gus, Ellie writes and records her first hit single. (‚Äò‚ÄôWhy Do Lovers Break Each Other‚Äôs Hearts?‚Äô‚Äô) At an office party celebrating her hit single, Ellie and Jeff meet again and begin flirting with each other. (‚Äò‚ÄôToday I Met The Boy I‚Äôm Gonna Marry‚Äô‚Äô) The office party culminates into a huge dance party, with each side singing about the opposite sex (‚Äò‚ÄôI Wanna Love Him So Bad/Do Wah Diddy‚Äô‚Äô). Ellie and her friends reflect on Ellie‚Äôs first date with Jeff and what their future holds. (‚Äò‚ÄôAnd Then He Kissed Me‚Äô‚Äô) On their second date, Ellie believes her and Jeff are going all the way, but Jeff‚Äôs intention was only to co-write music with her. (‚Äò‚ÄôHanky Panky‚Äô‚Äô) Jeff and Ellie get engaged despite objections, (‚Äò‚ÄôNot Too Young To Get Married‚Äô‚Äô) and they elope a few months later. (‚Äò‚ÄôChapel Of Love‚Äô‚Äô). Jeff and Ellie are now romantically involved as well as professionally, and they are an unstoppable team of songwriters. They continue to crank out hit songs for Darlene Love, The Crystals, The Shangri-Las, and Connie Francis, with much success. (‚Äò‚ÄôSongwriting Medley‚Äô‚Äô) and produce a new song for The Ronettes that nets the pair much acclaim. (‚Äò‚ÄôBaby, I Love You‚Äô‚Äô). Jeff and Ellie are enjoying their newfound fame and wealth, but things begin to take a rocky turn when Jeff begins to venture off and working solo and not with Ellie, and tensions rise between the two. (‚Äò‚ÄôLeader Of The Pack‚Äô‚Äô) =Act 2= Jeff and Ellie are in the midst of receiving numerous awards for their work, but it has become obvious their marriage is on the rocks. Jeff wishes to settle down while they are at the top and start a family, while Ellie wishes to continue working. This culminates into Jeff breaking off the marriage since he and Ellie want different things. (‚Äò‚ÄôLook Of Love‚Äô‚Äô) Ellie, still in love with Jeff and heartbroken over the separation, refuses to let anybody know that the marriage dissolved. (‚Äò‚ÄôChristmas (Baby, Please Come Home)‚Äô‚Äô). A few years have passed and Ellie is still writing music. She happens upon Jeff in the Brill Building one day when he arrives from Los Angeles on business. Ellie candidly admits how she misses him and wants to reconcile. However, Jeff is already engaged and settled in Los Angeles, much to Ellie‚Äôs shock. (‚Äò‚ÄôI Can Hear Music‚Äô‚Äô) Not being able to cope with her personal tragedies, Ellie spirals into a nervous breakdown. (‚Äò‚ÄôRock Of Rages‚Äô‚Äô) After a brief flash-forward into the 1980s, we see a renewed adult Ellie Greenwich who is in control of her life. (‚Äò‚ÄôKeep It Confidential‚Äô‚Äô) As she teaches a master class, she reflects back on some of her most famous work. (‚Äò‚ÄôDa Doo Ron Ron‚Äô‚Äô) However, she is also reminded of her former life and husband when telling about another one of her works. (‚Äò‚ÄôWhat A Guy‚Äô‚Äô) Ellie realizes that she and Jeff‚Äôs issues are a thing of the past and that her life is more successful than ever before. (\\"Maybe I Know\\") Ellie reunites with her equally successful friends, Darlene Love and Annie Golden, and gives Darlene a chance to sing a song that was originally hers, but reassigned to Tina Turner. (‚Äò‚ÄôRiver Deep, Mountain High‚Äô‚Äô). After reflecting on the life and times of their friendship, Ellie realizes that, through triumph and turmoil, she did make it in the end.

Koprzywnica lies on the Koprzywianka river, in Lesser Poland. It is one of the oldest urban centers of the province, located along the Tarnobrzeg Route of historic Lesser Polish Way of St. James, and on the National Road Nr. 79, which goes from Krak√≥w to Sandomierz. History The settlement of Koprzywnica existed already at the beginning of the 12th century, and at that time was called Pokrzywnica. In 1185, Prince Casimir II the Just brought here the Cistercians, and in the same year, local nobleman Miko≈Çaj Bogoria Skotnicki of Bogorya coat of arms presented Koprzywnica to the monks, together with several villages in the area. By order of the Duke of Sandomierz, Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste, Koprzywnica was granted town rights (see Magdeburg Rights), on December 8, 1268. Due to the presence of the Cistercians, Koprzywnica prospered, and from the 14th to the 17th century it was among medium-sized towns of Lesser Poland. In 1606, it was one of the centers of a rokosz (armed rebellion) of the nobility against King Zygmunt III Waza, organized by Miko≈Çaj Zebrzydowski. In 1655‚Äì1660 Koprzywnica was destroyed during the Swedish invasion of Poland. The town never recovered from the losses, and in 1869 Russian authorities of Congress Poland reduced it to the status of a village. Koprzywnica became a town again on January 1, 2001. =The Holocaust= Koprzywnica's ghetto was liquidated by German occupiers on 31 October 1942, when 1,800 Jews from the ghetto were transported by a Holocaust train to the Treblinka extermination camp and gassed to death, including expelees from Radom and Vienna.The statistical data compiled on the basis of \\"Glossary of 2,077 Jewish towns in Poland\\" by Virtual Shtetl Museum of the History of the Polish Jews , as well as \\"Getta ≈ªydowskie,\\" by Gedeon, and \\"Ghetto List\\" by Michael Peters at ARC 2005 .

History The town is located in historic Lesser Poland, and the earliest mention of Dzia≈Çoszyce in historical records comes from 1220. In 1409 King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço gave it a city charter (see Magdeburg rights). According to the 1921 census the town had a Jewish community consisting of 5618 people, or 83.6 percent of its total population. Jewish Historical Institute community database The vast majority of the Jewish population was exterminated in the Holocaust by German Nazis during their occupation of Poland. After the war, Jewish survivors from Dzia≈Çoszyce submitted contributions to a Memorial Book (Yizkor Book). Dzia≈Çoszyce Memorial Book In subsequent years the town's population did not recover, and today it is less than one fifth of what it was before the war. Dzia≈Çoszyce, located on the Nidzica river (a tributary to the Vistula), was in the Middle Ages placed along a merchant route from Krak√≥w to Wi≈õlica. The settlement prospered due to the protection of bishop of Krak√≥w Iwo OdrowƒÖ≈º, and King Kazimierz Wielki. In 1409, Dzia≈Çoszyce was granted Magdeburg rights by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. The town was part of Lesser Poland‚Äôs Sandomierz Voivodeship, and it belonged to the Ostrogski family, which collected tolls for crossing the river bridge. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Dzia≈Çoszyce was a local trade and craft center. In 1629 the town had 13 artisans, and a mill. In 1662 it had 468 inhabitants, and the right to organize 12 fairs a year. In 1795, following the Partitions of Poland, Dzia≈Çoszyce was first annexed by Austria, and in 1807 it passed on to the Duchy of Warsaw (since 1815 - Russian-controlled Congress Poland). At that time, the number of Jewish settlers increased in the town, and by 1820, it had 1692 inhabitants, 74% of whom were Jews. In the Second Polish Republic, Dzia≈Çoszyce belonged to Kielce Voivodeship, and in the 1920s and 1930s, the number of inhabitants decreased from 6755 (in 1920), to 5872 (1939). The town was occupied in September 1939 by the Germans. About 7000 Jews lived in the town at the beginning of the war, a number that increased significantly as refugees fled from other places, or were deported, to Dzialoszyce. On arrival, the Germans began robbing and terrorizing the Jewish population. They were crammed together in unsanitary conditions, often without running water. For example, 1000 people were housed in the synagogue and adjoining hall. In 1941, both typhoid and typhus epidemics spread throughout the community though a valiant Jewish doctors established processes of sanitation and disinfection. Some Jews were kidnapped and sent to forced labor camps. In early September 1942, the Jews were rounded up. The old and weak were taken to the cemetery in carts driven by Polish peasants under German orders. At least 1200 were machine gunned to death there. Most of the rest were sent by train to Belzec where they were immediately gassed. A few were sent to a labor camp. Several younger Jews fled to the forest and joined partisan groups fighting the Germans. By the end of the war, fewer than 200 survived. Actions in Dzialoszyce were typical of the actions in other Polish towns as part of the Holocaust. In 1946, the population of the town was 2506. Among points of interest there are parish church of Holy Trinity (1222, frequently remodelled) and ruins of a synagogue (1852).

It lives in the gut of an entomopathogenic nematode of the family Heterorhabditidae. When the nematode infects an insect, P. luminescens is released into the blood stream and rapidly kills the insect host (within 48 hours) by producing toxins, such as the high molecular weight insecticidal protein complex Tca. P. luminescens also produces a proteic toxin through the expression of a single gene called makes caterpillars floppy (mcf). It also secretes enzymes which break down the body of the infected insect and bioconvert it into nutrients which can be used by both nematode and bacteria. In this way, both organisms gain enough nutrients to replicate (or reproduce in the case of the nematode) several times. The bacteria enter the nematode progeny as they develop. 3,5-Dihydroxy-4-isopropyl-trans-stilbene is produced by P. luminescens bacterial symbiont of the nematode Heterorhabditis megidis. Experiments with Galleria mellonella infected larvae supports the hypothesis that the compound has antibiotic properties that help minimize competition from other microorganisms and prevents the putrefaction of the nematode- infected insect cadaver. P. luminescens is bioluminescent; however, the reason for this is not yet properly understood. It has been reported that infection by this bacterium of the wounds of soldiers in the American Civil War caused the wounds to glow, and that this aided the survival of the soldiers due to the production of antibiotics by P. luminescens. This led to the phenomenon's nickname \\"Angel's Glow.\\" P. luminescens genome has been sequenced. It contains a MACPF protein, however, this molecule appears non-lytic. It also contains the gcvB RNA gene which encodes a small non-coding RNA involved in the regulation of a number of amino acid transport systems as well as amino acid biosynthetic genes. A deletion of the hfq gene causes loss of secondary metabolite production. It is a source for bioluminescence imaging.

It has one runway designated 11/29 with a concrete surface measuring 3,800 by 100 feet (1,158 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, the airport had 36,000 aircraft operations, an average of 98 per day: 99% general aviation and 1% air taxi. In September 2016, there were 78 aircraft based at this airport: 59 single-engine, 7 multi-engine, 4 jet and 8 helicopter.  History  = Beginning = A 1945 navy map of Glenview Naval Air Station and its 15 satellite airfields depicts an ‚ÄúL‚Äù shaped landing field in Schaumburg with a designation of ‚ÄúSC‚Äù. In 1946, there were numerous Navy landing fields but Schaumburg was described as being located at the South East corner of Schaumburg Road and Barrington Roads. Roselle Airfield According to a news article, purchase of land for Roselle Field was started in 1959 and the property resides in an unincorporated area of Cook and DuPage counties. An article dated February 25, 1960 in the Roselle Register mentions that Leonard Boeske will start building the airport by March 25, 1960. April 13, 1961 Roselle Register article \\"work on the airport is 80 percent complete...\\" \\"Landscaping and sodding will be finished by June 1, said Boeske\\". May 25, 1961 Dan Smith Illinois Safety inspector landed at Roselle Field and certified the showpiece airfield safe for operation. The official opening was delayed until about mid-July. Between June 26, 1961 and May 27, 1963 there were at least five meetings to get Roselle Field annexed into the Village of Roselle. In 1963, there were 2 FBO‚Äôs at Roselle Airfield, Ace Aviation in the old flight office and B&M; aircraft/Roselle Beechcraft in the big hangar. Ace Aviation was owned by Wilbur (Pip) Snyder who owned Ace Hardware in Roselle Illinois and was a Piper dealer. Internal to Ace Aviation was Cliff Hutton who was the airport manager. Roselle Beechcraft was owned by Harold (Hal) MaGee (The ‚ÄúM‚Äù in B&M; and the ‚ÄúB‚Äù was Brunke who had died and Richard (Dick) C. Leach. The restaurant on top was owned by a postman named Chris Heidt. Schaumburg Airport In December 1963, the Village of Schaumburg Annexed the Roselle Airport. 1964-1965 the combined flight schools had 5 Piper Colts, 2 Cherokees, 3 Skyhawks, 1 twin Comanche, 1 Comanche 400, 3 Comanche 250s, 2 Debonairs, 1 F model Bonanza, 1 P model Bonanza, 1 S model Bonanza, 4 or 5 Beech Muskateers, 1 Cessna 310, 1 Beech Travelair and 1 235 Apache. A Chicago sectional chart dated December 10, 1964 depicts Roselle Airfield West of O‚ÄôHare and Northwest of Mitchell Airport. In 1965, the terminal building on the north side of the apron was built. It was made of brick exterior bearing walls with metal framing in the roof and has a concrete floor. Heat was generated from hot water tubing encased in the concrete floor. In 1965 or 1966, there was an attempt to get private financing to resurface the runway. At the time, the paved runway (10/28) was 2600' by 46', there was a N/E-S/W turf runway on the west side which started at old Irving Park road and ended before the C&NW; Railroad tracks aligned with the taxiway that crossed the runway which formed the last 200 feet of the runway. It was 1200' or 1400' long. Taken from Richard Lessow. In 1965 or 1966, the airport was hit by two tornados. There was a massive loss of aircraft. The first one occurred at dusk and I was there. We all took shelter in the old flight office. I remember looking at the anemometer pegged at 110 MPH then the sensor blew off the building. After the cell had passed I looked out of the flight office window to see a Piper Colt with its spinner touching the glass, sitting on its landing gear without any wings. A lot of the aircraft fuselages were torn loose leaving their wings still tied to the tie downs. The second one occurred later in the season, late Saturday evening or early Sunday morning. I always opened the airport up on Sunday mornings and was the first one there. As I stopped at Roselle Rd. and Rt. 19, I notice an engine and wing section from a twin Comanche in the trees across from the old Roselle Ford car lot. I thought someone had crashed. When I got to the airport the damage was even more devastating than the first. Wreckage was scattered for miles to the south and east. Additionally, there was extensive building and vehicle damage. Some owners lost two aircraft in one summer. A concrete pad was built by the fuel pumps to hold the lighted Aero Shell sign. It had to be to Shell specs and was by hand 4'x4'x5'. Doug Stenoin (spelling?) who along with Jon Mosby had a 182 in one of the T hangers, was a local drywall supplier and brought out a cherry picker and lifted, installed, and wired the sign. In 1970, the property was placed in a trust with the First National Bank of Chicago. On Friday, February 6, 1970 8:00 a.m. President Richard Nixon and Mrs. Nixon were scheduled to land at Schaumburg Airport. After arriving in a large Blue Marine 1 helicopter, he obtained a ride in a limousine to the water treatment plant. According to news articles, President Nixon went to the water treatment plant in Hanover Park and was offered a drink of treated water that was turned down by the President. Schaumburg Airport Feasibility Study of 1974 (Roselle History museum) Schaumburg Airport Feasibility Study of 1974 (Roselle History museum) According to the study, there are 26 general aviation airport facilities in the Chicago Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). Schaumburg Airport (SA) is approximately 10 miles from O‚ÄôHare. Access Schaumburg Airport is on Illinois Route 19, approximately 0.5 miles east of the intersection of Irving Park Road and Rodenburg Road.

Of the 123 planes, 100 were owned by individuals that leased tiedown or hangar space from Schaumburg Airport, Inc. Schaumburg Airport, Inc owns 10. Lloyd‚Äôs Flying owned 13 aircraft for the flight school and these aircraft were used primarily for instruction. All of the planes weighed under 8,000 pounds. Number of takeoffs and landings (estimated for 1974) were 64,934. = 1960 to 1985 = The earliest map depicting Roselle Field was the December 10, 1964 Chicago Sectional Chart. According to the Illinois Airport Directory, the manager was Richard Leach, and there was Beechcraft sales/service on the field. Roselle Field was annexed into the Village of Schaumburg. The runway was long and wide at the time. In 1965, the runway was extended to . On February 6, 1970, President Richard M. Nixon flew to Roselle Field to dedicate a water treatment plant at the corner of Barrington and Irving Park Road in neighboring Hanover Park. In the early 1970s, the name was changed to Schaumburg Airpark. The Fixed-Base Operator (FBO) changed to Northwest Flyers in 1985, who continues to operate as the FBO today. = 1994 to 1999 = The Village of Schaumburg purchased the airport in 1994 to prevent it from being sold to developers. In 1995, the village replaced the 3,000√ó40-foot asphalt runway with a 3,800√ó100-foot concrete runway with a parallel taxiway, and concrete tie-down areas for parking. In 1998, construction of the 26,000 square foot terminal building was completed, including space for a quality restaurant, public meeting rooms, and space for businesses to operate in a facility that is both functional and architecturally impressive. 1999 saw the arrival of a new fuel farm for jet fuel (Jet-A) and aviation gasoline (100LL Avgas). A self-service station was installed for the 100LL. = 2000 to Present = New hangars, consisting of 33 units were completed between 2000 and 2001, as well as the installation of the PAPI. PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) is a system of lights that provide pilots vertical guidance to the runway. This assists the pilot in determining whether they are too high, too low, or right on the glide path.

Smith, was a survivor of the 1912 RMS Titanic disaster. Her first husband, Lucien P. Smith, scion of a wealthy Morgantown family with vast holdings in the Pennsylvania coal fields died in the sinking; she later married a fellow survivor. Mrs. Smith's recollections of the sinking have been quoted in numerous documentaries about the sinking of the ship, and she has been portrayed in at least one fictional depiction of the disaster. Lucian Philip and Eloise Hughes Smith boarded Titanic on Wednesday evening, 10 April 1912 in Cherbourg on their way home from their honeymoon. The couple had considered taking the older, smaller, and slightly faster Cunard liner RMS Lusitania home but ultimately decided to buy a ticket for the maiden voyage of the newest, and most luxurious ship in the White Star fleet, Titanic. Their trip had included a transatlantic crossing to Europe aboard Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic and sightseeing in Italy, France, the Middle East and Egypt. She survived the sinking of the Titanic to give birth to her son Lucian Philip Smith II on 29 November 1912.Lucian P. Smith 29 Nov 1912 - 24 Oct 1971, Ancestry.com.

She later married a fellow survivor, Robert Daniel, a bank executive, in 1914. In 1923 Smith divorced Daniel and married Lewis H. Cort, Jr. Cort died several years later, and she married C.S. Wright in 1929. They lived in Charleston, and soon divorced. Smith was a member of the Vinson political family; the daughter of United States Representative James A. Hughes and Belle Vinson. As children, Smith and her sister had made the acquaintance of President Theodore Roosevelt. She was a popular public speaker. She was active in Republican Party politics and campaigned for women's suffrage. She worked for a time at the pension bureau in Washington D.C. Smith was quoted extensively in the 1912 best-selling book The Sinking of the Titanic by Jay Henry Mowbray. Her letters and other recollections were also used by the documentary filmmaker Melissa Jo Peltier in the A&E; Network documentaries Titanic: Death of a Dream and Titanic: The Legend Lives On to illustrate the hours between the Titanics encounter with the iceberg and the rescue of the survivors by RMS Carpathia, and in the documentary Titanic: Anatomy of a Disaster. She was portrayed in the documentary television series Seconds from Disaster by Jennifer Lee Trendowski in the episode featuring the Titanic. Smith died of a heart attack in 1940 at the age of 46 in a sanitarium in Cincinnati.

It was founded in 1925 and is associated with University College Cork. The Press publishes under its own imprint and two others: Attic (which specializes in women's studies) and Atrium.Hutton C. and Walsh P. (Ed.) The Oxford History of the Irish Book, Volume V: The Irish Book in English, 1891‚Äì2000 OUP Oxford, 2011. Foundation In 1908, Cork University was restructured and Queens College Cork become University College Cork. In 1925, Cork University Press was founded by Alfred O'Rahilly, the registrar (1920‚Äì1943) and president (1943‚Äì1954) of University College Cork (UCC). In the early years, a triumvirate of three directors managed CUP. These were the University College Cork president, the registrar and the secretary or bursar. In 1934, Daniel Corkery joined them. Alfred O'Rahilly (1925‚Äì1953) O'Rahilly said of CUP, \\"I took the initiative in order to convince the College of the feasibility and desirability of the project\\".Murphy J. A History of Cork University Press Cork University Press website. Accessed 1 October 2017 O'Rahilly guided CUP policy and conducted CUP business, including communicating with readers, agents and publishers. O'Rahilly also had an association with Blackwell, the scientific publishing company of Oxford. O'Rahilly was a friend of Basil Blackwell (1889‚Äì1984), the son of the founder. In 1943, when O'Rahilly became president of University College Cork, Kathleen O'Flaherty of the French Department managed much of the editorial and management work of CUP in an unpaid capacity, which she continued for ten years. O'Flaherty published three books through Cork University Press and remained a member of the CUP committee. O'Rahilly had realistic views about the limited impact of advertising. He said, \\"‚Ä¶ the market for our books is limited by their nature. No amount of advertising will convince the average creamery manager that he should read The Psychology of Sartre or the psychologist that he should buy Commercial Methods of Testing Milk. In 1952, he aimed to publish four books per year, one of which could be afforded as a loss. In the period 1942‚Äì1945 and in 1954, outside marketing managers were engaged to improve sales at CUP. The first was L. J. Wrenne, a publisher and printer in Cork. The latter John M. Feehan of the Mercier Press. O'Rahilly considered the endeavours unsuccessful. On his retirement in 1953, O'Rahilly acknowledged that some might see CUP as a personal conceit. He said, \\"no loss has been incurred by any of my publications. I should have had no difficulty in finding other publishers for my books\\" and, \\"In 1928 I handed the CUP to the College: since that date the College owns and controls the Press. I have never made nor do I now make, any claims, financial or proprietary, on the CUP.\\" Between 1948 and 1953, O'Rahilly donated ¬£700 and part of his salary to a total of ¬£1,250 to CUP. He took no monetary remuneration from the press. The titles published in O'Rahilly's time included James Handley's The Irish in Scotland (1945); O'Rahilly's own book, Money (1941); Daniel Corkery's Synge and Anglo-Irish Literature (1931); James Hogan's Election and Representation (1945); and Bridget G. MacCarthy's Women Writers (1944). Those in the Irish language included T. F. O'Rahilly's D√°nta Gr√°dha (1926); Measgra D√°nta (1927); and the festschrift Feilscribhinn Torna (ed. S. Pender, 1947). Others included Edward MacLysaght's Irish Life in the Seventeenth Century (2nd edn. 1950); and Se√°n P. √ì Riord√°in's Antiquities of the Irish Countryside (2nd edn. 1944). From 1944 to 1980, CUP published the Cork University Record (from 1956, the UCC Record), which appeared initially three times a year and later annually. It chronicled the year's events, carried statements of college policy, detailed staff appointments and obituaries, and included articles on college history and personal reminiscences. In O'Rahilly's time the Record served as a medium for the expression of his own cultural and educational philosophy. Denis Gwynn (1953‚Äì1963) After O'Rahilly's departure, the affairs of CUP were conducted by a committee of senior staff members. This was a small inner circle to begin with, but became larger and more representative of the academic disciplines in subsequent decades. From the mid-1950s, Denis Gwynn was a dominant presence in the CUP committee. A member of a distinguished scholarly and literary family, Gwynn was research professor of modern Irish history at UCC (1947‚Äì1963). He had strong links with the spheres of journalism and publishing in Britain and Ireland. Gwynn was a (part-time salaried) general editor from 1955 until 1963, when he retired from UCC. He implemented the publishing of important lectures by visiting dignitaries. A discussion on general policy at a CUP committee meeting in 1956 ended in agreement that \\"it was the function of Cork University Press to undertake as far as possible the publication of scholarly books and pamphlets for members of the staff. This of course may frequently involve loss ‚Ä¶\\", to cover which the CUP was in receipt of a grant from the College. The same meeting expressed the opinion that the CUP \\"should exclusively undertake occasionally the publication of a first- class book of general interest and even one of some magnitude\\". 1963‚Äì1990 In 1963, the general editor position was replaced by an editorial committee. The committee was assisted by an executive secretary, a post filled from the College staff. The CUP continued in its core business of academic publishing, particularly Irish and Anglo-Irish works. The committee considered publishing potboilers in order to fund more serious works. Although Denis Gwynn had disapproved of CUP publishing texts prepared by professors for their students, that was not the majority view of the CUP committee. In the late 1960s, there were brisk sales of laboratory notes on inorganic semi-micro analysis; Commercial Methods of Testing Milk and student texts such as Introduction to Practical Chemistry and A Notebook for Practical Botany. Although the CUP was not a fully commercial entity, the assessment of manuscripts was rigorous, readers were chosen carefully and were paid an honorarium. The amount was five guineas in 1960, ten guineas in 1967 and forty pounds in 1983. The CUP rejected works of students, amateur authors and memoirists. Some works were rejected due to inadequate resources. Raymond Crotty's Irish Agricultural Production (1966) was a notable, quality, landmark publication. The CUP carefully protected its prestige with wariness of co-publications. At times, the CUP committee, experienced difficulties with publishing industry agents, advisers, and printers which could be costly. In the 1980s, CUP established a fruitful relationship with Se√°n Daly of Tower Books. CUP income included sales revenue, author contributions and an annual UCC grant. In 1928 the grant was ¬£250, ¬£500 in 1949, and ¬£10,000 in 1987. A subvention from the National University of Ireland was granted where a work had an Irish context. The CUP budget was also dependent on the decisions of the UCC secretariat and bursar's office. In 1988, CUP's deficit was nearly ¬£77,000. Difficulties for CUP included poor catalogue design, outdated office equipment, inadequate packaging and distribution, high publishing costs and small turnover. 1990‚Äì2000 In December 1989, a new committee was convened. Alec McAulay, a publisher with Leicester University Press, was engaged to make an analysis of CUP and suggestions for improvement. The UCC president questioned whether it was in the UCC's best interest for the CUP to be continued. If so, it ould need to be a fully fledged publishing house. In 1992, the CUP was relaunched. The publishing list was expanded. New endeavours included commercially oriented academic publications and some non-academic publications. For example, in 1993, The Cork Anthology was published and in 1997, Atlas of the Irish Rural Landscape was published. The CUP took commissions more seriously. A series entitled Undercurrents contributed to public debate. In 1997, CUP purchased Attic Press, a feminist publishing house. By 2000, UCC funding of CUP was decreased to twenty percent of CUP's budget. Recent publications include James Kelly's Duelling in Ireland (1995); Joep Leerssen's Mere Irish and Fior-Gael (1996); Kevin Whelan's The Tree of Liberty, 1760‚Äì1830 (1996); Fintan Vallely's Companion to Irish Traditional Music (1999); Terry Eagleton's Crazy John and the Bishop (1998); Michael Cronin's Across the Lines: Travel, Language and Translation (2000); and the Atlas of the Irish Rural Landscape (1997).

He furthered his studies at the Gregorian Pontificial University in Rome where he did his Licence in Theology (Dogmatics). He also studied the Holy Scriptures at Pontificio Istituto Bibblico in Rome where he did his licence in the Holy Scripture. He returned to Malta in 1954 and was given the responsibility of teaching young Capuchin students. Between 1958 and 1967 he was parish priest of the Holy Trinity Church in Marsa. Throughout those years he was instrumental in the construction of the parochial centre St. Pius X. Between 1983 and 1991, again he was asked to serve as a parish priest of Our Lady of Lourdes in San Gwann. Throughout the years he served in San Gwann, he again felt the need to gather the lay movements under one roof. Thus, the parochial centre San Guzepp came to be. He found time also to restore the Sta. Margherita chapel - which now houses the Holy Sepulchre for daily adoration. From 1966 to 1988, he was lecturer and Professor of Biblical Studies at the Faculty of Theology at the University of Malta where together with Prof. Karm Sant and others set up the Malta Bible Society, of which he was President. The main achievement of this Society was the publication of the Holy Bible in Maltese. The translation commenced in 1966 and continued until it was published in 1984. Since then, the Bible was revised yet again, taking another five years. Hence, the second edition was published in 1996. As the teaching and interpretation of the Bible were and still are his life's mission, he was instrumental in opening Dar il-Bibbja in Floriana as a Bible Centre. Donat Spiteri is also the author of numerous books of theological and biblical themes, of which il-Ktieb tas-Salmi (Book of Psalms), Dizzjunarju Bibbliku (Bible Dictionary), Temi Teologici (Theological Themes), l-Evangelji ta' San Mattew u San Luqa (The Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke), il-Ktieb ta' l-Atti ta' l-Appostli (The Book of the Acts of the Apostles) and many others are being published by the Malta Bible Society. He also was a regular contributor in articles to the local press and various religious magazines such as Dawl Frangiskan, besides lecturing and explaining the Holy Bible on the local media. He also toured various parishes in Malta and Gozo where he gave Biblical courses. In 1974 Donat felt the need to spread further Bible reading into the Maltese households. Thus, he launched the small booklet Kliem il-Hajja (the Word of Life) which has become synonymous with him. This booklet is issued every quarter and helps and simplifies the daily reading of the Bible. He was the editor since its origin and today is the Director General. Today, this booklet finds its way in many homes throughout Malta and Gozo - and also amongst our Maltese emigrants abroad. It is worth mentioning that over 20,000 Kliem il-Hajja booklets are distributed thanks to the many volunteers. On the 30th Anniversary of this publication, he inaugurated a Kliem il-Hajja office and library inside the Capuchins Friary at Floriana, Malta where most of this booklet is prepared. All those interested in Biblical studies have now another place where to study the Bible more in depth, besides going through the many works of Donat Spiteri. Donat Spiteri was honoured with the Gieh il-Marsa and Gieh San Gwann by the respective Local Councils as appreciation for his service to their community. On 13 December 2009 Donat Spiteri was awarded the Midalja gƒßall-Qadi tar-Repubblika (Medal for Service to the Republic) by the President of Malta George Abela, on behalf of the government and people of Malta.

Neurogranin is the main postsynaptic protein regulating the availability of calmodulin, binding to it in the absence of calcium. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C lowers its binding ability. NRGN gene expression is controlled by thyroid hormones. Human neurogranin consists of 78 amino acids. One study tells of potential link of neurogranin gene to the heightened risk of schizophrenia in males, another study gives evidence of lowered neurogranin immunoreactivity in the brains of people suffering from schizophrenia. Neurogranin concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is further discussed as marker for synaptic dysfunction in age-related neurodegeneration. It has also been shown to be specifically increased in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Especially the ratio of CSF neurogranin trunc P75 and the beta-secretase BACE1 is suggested as potential marker for cognitive deterioration in the progress of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Prior to its identification in the bovine and rat brain in 1991, neurogranin was known as a putative protein kinase C-phosphorylated protein named p17.

Biography  =Early life= Adrienne von Speyr was born in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, to an upper-middle-class Protestant family. Her father, Theodor von Speyr, was an ophthalmologist. Her mother, Laure Girard, was the descendant of a family of noted watchmakers and jewelers from Geneva and Neuch√¢tel. Adrienne was her parents' second child. Her sister, H√©l√®ne, was a year and a half older. Her first brother, Willy, who became a physician, was born in 1905 and died in 1978. Her second brother, Theodor, was born in 1913 and served as the director of the Swiss Bank Corporation in London for many years. La Chaux-de-Fonds, 1904 By Hans Urs von Balthasar's account, von Speyr was the \\"unloved child\\" in her family, despite her cheerfulness. Her mother scolded her daily, often without reason, which led Adrienne to turn to prayer and to develop an appreciation for sacrifice and renunciation. She was close to her father, who understood and respected her, sometimes taking her with him to the hospital to visit sick children. This sparked her desire to become a physician, which would eventually guide her toward a career as a family doctor. In her primary school years, she began knitting for the poor, forming a society with her friends for this purpose. From early on, she had a deep relationship with her grandmother, a prayerful Calvinist.Von Speyr, My Early Years, pp. 19‚Äì23, 405‚Äì27. Von Speyr was a precocious student. As a child, she even occasionally substituted for a teacher who suffered from asthma.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 23. In her religion classes, however, she began to sense an emptiness in the form of Protestantism being offered.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 20. Although she had no exposure to the Roman Catholic Church, she had some early intuitions about Catholic practice. At the age of nine, she gave a talk to her classmates about the Jesuits, after an angel had told her \\"that the Jesuits were people who loved Jesus totally, and that the truth of God was greater than that of men, and as a result one could not always tell people everything exactly as one understands it in God\\". After her conversion to Catholicism in 1940, at thirty-eight years old, she recounted to her confessor Hans Urs von Balthasar that as a young child she encountered in a stairwell a man she only now recognized to be Saint Ignatius of Loyola. During her teenage years, she once reproached a religion teacher for his \\"prejudice\\" against Catholicism.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 23. =Education and teenage years= For secondary school, von Speyr attended a coeducational gymnasium, where she excelled, particularly in Latin and Greek.Von Speyr, My Early Years, pp. 96‚Äì104, 128‚Äì140 et passim. At her mother's insistence, she also spent a year at a girls' school in La Chaux-de-Fonds, since the gymnasium was thought to give her too much exposure to boys. Here, she met fellow student Madeleine Gallet, who became a close companion and helped her mold her sense of Christian discipleship.Von Speyr, My Early Years, pp. 140‚Äì54. After a year, von Speyr's father allowed her to return to the gymnasium, where her classmates greeted her with wild applause when she entered.Von Speyr, My Early Years, p. 154‚Äì55. She was popular for her sense of humor and strong ethical judgment.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 25. In November 1917, at age fifteen, she experienced a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. \\"I had never seen anything so beautiful,\\" she later remarked, noting that this image of Mary gave her a \\"place of refuge\\" in the years that followed.Von Speyr, My Early Years, pp. 166‚Äì67. Adrienne von Speyr during secondary school Adrienne was often sick, with spondylitis that frequently kept her bedridden. According to von Balthasar, she always became ill before Easter and sensed that this was connected with Good Friday.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 23. She came to understand her physical suffering as a way of sharing in the pain of others, and she spent much time with the patients at her uncle's psychiatric hospital near Bern, where she discovered a gift for consoling the sick.Von Balthasar, First Glance, pp. 23‚Äì24Von Speyr, My Early Years, pp. 60‚Äì66. Theodor von Speyr, Adrienne's father, died of gastrointestinal perforation in January 1918, when she was fifteen.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 25. After his death, Adrienne studied at a business school at her mother's request, in addition to her work at the gymnasium. Just a few months later, she contracted tuberculosis, and doctors believed she would die within a year. She was sent to a sanatorium at Leysin, where she was cared for by her cousin, a physician. Her mother rarely wrote or visited. At the sanatorium, von Speyr learned Russian, read Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and was invited to give lectures to fellow patients. One of these talks reportedly prompted her friend Louisa Jacques (later the Poor Clare Sister Mary of the Holy Trinity) to remark, \\"You're going to make me become a Catholic.\\"Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 26.Von Speyr, My Early Years, pp. 193‚Äì94. At Leysin, Adrienne, too, began to feel drawn to the Roman Catholic Church. An illustration of Basel from the early twentieth century After recovering from a second bout of tuberculosis, von Speyr studied nursing for several months at l'H√¥pital Saint-Loup near Pompaples, but left dissatisfied.Von Speyr, My Early Years, pp. 219‚Äì28. She eventually moved with her family to Basel in summer 1921 to finish her secondary studies. Although her mother tried to arrange a job and a husband for her, Adrienne resolved instead to enter medical school at the University of Basel, which created a rift between them.Von Speyr, My Early Years, p. 272. She studied in the Faculty of Medicine between 1923 and 1926, working as a tutor to pay her tuition.Von Speyr, My Early Years, p. 272. She was a pupil of Gerhard Hotz and became a friend of fellow medical students Adolf Portmann, a zoologist, and Franz Merke, a surgeon. She was inspired by the dedication of several doctors and nurses, and shocked by what she perceived as the cowardice or egotism of others.Von Speyr, My Early Years, pp. 265‚Äì396. These experiences would later shape her views on the medical practice, particularly her beliefs in the physician's responsibility for his patients, in the medical profession as self-giving service, in the treatment of the whole person, and in the call to accompany terminally ill patients to the end. In a short biography of von Speyr, von Balthasar lists some of the decisive features of her time in medical school: > [C]omplete contentment when she could finally work with the sick, when she > could make silent rounds at night in the wards in order to comfort, to help, > to prepare the dying for death; her indignation when patients used in > demonstrations in the lecture halls or unwed mothers in the delivery room > were not treated with respect for their human dignity; her anger when a > doctor, responsible for the death of a patient, put the blame on one of the > nurses (Adrienne saw to it that his lectures were boycotted by the entire > student body until the doctor had to give up his professorship in Basel); > her admiration at the silent asceticism of a large number of the nurses.Von > Balthasar, First Glance, p. 29. \\"In these and many other experiences,\\" he adds, \\"Adrienne learned to seek the God whom she had not yet succeeded in truly finding by the way of service to neighbor.\\"Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 29. =Medical practice= Adrienne von Speyr during a bicycle tour, 1924 In 1930, von Speyr passed her state boards to become a licensed physician, one of the first women in Switzerland to be admitted to the profession. The following year, she started a family medicine practice in Basel.Von Speyr, My Early Years, p. 399. As a doctor, she refused to perform abortions and reportedly dissuaded \\"thousands of women\\" from abortion over the course of her career.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 33. Since her clientele was mostly poor, she treated many of them free of charge; according to von Balthasar, she ‚Äúsaw as many as sixty to eighty patients a day‚Äù.von Balthasar, Hans Urs, \\"Adriennes Charisma,\\" in Adrienne von Speyr und ihre kirchliche Sendung, eds. Hans Urs von Balthasar, Georges Chantraine, and Angelo Scola (Einsiedeln: Johannes Verlag, 1986), p. 176.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 33. After moving her office to her home for a time during the early 1950s,Hans Urs von Balthasar, ‚ÄúAdrienne von Speyr als √Ñrztin,‚Äù in Missionskalender 1972, ed. Benediktiner-Missionare von St. Ottilien (Eresing: Editions Sankt Ottilien, 1972), pp. 58‚Äì61. von Speyr ceased to practice medicine due to illness in 1954. = Marriage and family life = In 1927, during a trip to San Bernardino, Switzerland, some friends of von Speyr introduced her to the University of Basel historian Emil D√ºrr, a widower with two young sons. D√ºrr and von Speyr married, living on the M√ºnsterplatz near the historic Basel Minster church. Von Speyr, who took the name of D√ºrr, became an adoptive mother to the two boys, Niklaus and Arnold, and played an active role with her husband in upper-class Basel society.Lois Miles, Obedience of a Corpse: The Key to the Holy Saturday Writings of Adrienne von Speyr (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Aberdeen, 2013), p. 44. She had three miscarriages and bore no children of her own.Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 34. The couple ‚Äúseriously considered becoming Catholic‚Äù,Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 153. but Emil died suddenly in a tram accident in 1934, after seven years of marriage. The untimely death of her husband led Adrienne into an interior crisis, provoking her to contemplate suicide until her friend Franz Merke intervened.Von Speyr, My Early Years, p. 397. The widowed von Speyr continued to raise Niklaus and Arnold on her own and to practice medicine. In 1936, Emil D√ºrr‚Äôs friend and colleague Werner Kaegi‚Äîwho knew the boys and wanted to help bring them up‚Äîproposed marriage, and she accepted.Adrienne von Speyr, Geheimnis der Jugend (Einsiedeln: Johannes Verlag, 1966), p. 299. Kaegi, a lifelong member of the Swiss Reformed Church, encouraged von Speyr to explore Catholicism, and she converted in 1940.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 153. Von Speyr‚Äôs daughter-in-law Lore D√ºrr- Freckmann recalls that the couple provided financially for single mothers and opened their home to disadvantaged women and children.Cited in Miles, Obedience, p. 44. Between 1952 and 1967, the Kaegi family also offered a room in their house to Father Hans Urs von Balthasar.Peter Henrici, ‚ÄúHans Urs von Balthasar: A Sketch of His Life,‚Äù Communio 16 (Fall 1989): 326. Niklaus and Arnold both married and had a number of children, who considered von Speyr their grandmother. Von Speyr remained close to her sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren until her death in 1967. In interviews, her family has described her as joyful, warm, and generous.Miles, Obedience, p. 42 = Conversion = Von Speyr began to attend Mass periodically after her husband Emil D√ºrr‚Äôs death in 1934. In the years following his fatal accident, she found it difficult to pray, especially the line ‚ÄúThy will be done‚Äù in the Our Father.Von Balthasar, First Glance, pp. 151‚Äì52. After her marriage to Werner Kaegi in 1936, von Speyr made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Catholic priests to receive instruction in the Catholic faith.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 31. Adrienne von Speyr In 1940, after recovering from a heart attack, she was introduced by a friend to Father Hans Urs von Balthasar, a Jesuit priest then serving as a university chaplain in Basel. She told him of her interest in entering the Catholic Church, and he began to give her catechetical instruction. Von Balthasar says of this process, ‚ÄúIn the instructions she understood everything immediately, as though she had only‚Äîand for how long!‚Äîwaited to hear exactly what I was saying in order to affirm it.‚ÄùVon Balthasar, First Glance, p. 32. Von Speyr praised the Jesuit for having ‚Äúremoved all the obstacles for me‚Äù in prayer.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 154. She was received into the Catholic Church on All Saints‚Äô Day, November 1, 1940. After the liturgy, von Speyr apologized for having accidentally omitted the words ‚Äúextra quam nulla salus‚Äù during the profession of faith; when von Balthasar and her husband both replied that they had heard the phrase, she remarked, ‚ÄúThen maybe an angel said it for me‚Äù.Adrienne von Speyr, Nachlasswerke, vol. 8 (Einsiedeln: Johannes Verlag, 1975), pp. 160‚Äì61. Still, some scholars have criticized her for leaving out this portion of the profession. She was confirmed shortly after her reception into the Church, with the critic and translator Albert B√©guin as her sponsor.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 32. Since von Speyr had many Protestant friends in Basel, her conversion to Catholicism caused some controversy.Miles, Obedience, p. 19. Her own mother and siblings took a distance from her after her confirmation, though they would reconcile years later.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 32. Von Speyr‚Äôs husband, Werner, supported her embrace of Catholicism, but he himself did not convert. Her sons Niklaus and Arnold, with their children, were eventually received into the Church, along with other family members.Miles, Obedience, p. 52. By von Balthasar's account, von Speyr went on to befriend many notable Catholic thinkers in Europe, including Romano Guardini, Hugo Rahner, Erich Przywara, Henri de Lubac, Reinhold Schneider, Annette Kolb, and Gabriel Marcel.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 32. = Collaboration with Hans Urs von Balthasar = In the months following her conversion to Catholicism, von Speyr reported having extraordinary experiences in prayer. Von Balthasar became convinced of the authenticity of von Speyr‚Äôs mysticism, and the two recognized that they had a shared theological mission.Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 13‚Äì20. Between 1944 and 1960, von Speyr dictated to von Balthasar some sixty books of spiritual and Scriptural commentary, including John, Mark, The Letter to the Ephesians, Elijah, and Three Women and the Lord. Given von Speyr‚Äôs commitments as a mother and a doctor, von Balthasar alone worked to arrange, edit, and publish the texts with ecclesiastical approval through the German-language press Johannes Verlag Einsiedeln. One of her first books to appear was her translation of The Story of a Soul by Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux‚Äîthe first in the German language‚Äîfollowed by Magd des Herrn [Handmaid of the Lord], a book of Marian reflections.Henrici, Peter. \\"A Sketch of von Balthasar's Life.\\" In Hans Urs von Balthasar: His Life and Work. Edited by David L. Schindler. San Francisco: Communio Books and Ignatius Press, 1991. P. 31. Some works, namely those of a more explicitly mystical character, were not released until Pope John Paul II organized a Vatican symposium on von Speyr's work in 1985, almost twenty years after her death.Von Balthasar, First Glance, pp. 91‚Äì95.Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 9. Von Speyr and von Balthasar also collaborated closely in the founding of the Johannesgemeinschaft (Community of Saint John), a Catholic institute of consecrated laypeople established in 1945.Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 55. After a long discernment, von Balthasar would eventually leave the Society of Jesus to found this community, since his superiors did not believe it would be compatible with Jesuit life. He saw it as a \\"personal, special, and non-delegable task.\\" Von Speyr referred to the Johannesgemeinschaft metaphorically as a ‚ÄúChild‚Äù she shared with the priest‚Äîan analogy that has drawn some criticism but been defended by others.Miles, Obedience, pp. 11, 50‚Äì52. Von Speyr served as the superior of the women‚Äôs branch of the community until her death. Von Balthasar, for his part, has stated that his own theological work is inseparable from von Speyr‚Äôs.Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 13. ‚ÄúThe greater part of so much of what I have written is a translation of what is present in a more immediate, less technical fashion in the powerful work of Adrienne von Speyr.‚ÄùHans Urs von Balthasar, My Work in Retrospect (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1993), p. 105. = Later years and death = Hildegard of Bingen Von Speyr gave up her medical practice in 1954 due to deteriorating health. She suffered from diabetes, heart disease, and severe arthritis, which caused her intense pain and greatly weakened her. According to von Balthasar, ‚Äúno physician could understand how she could still be alive.‚ÄùVon Balthasar, First Glance, p. 44. During this period, she prayed, knitted, visited with her grandchildren, wrote letters, read novels, and continued guiding the women in the Johannesgemeinschaft.Von Balthasar, First Glance, pp. 37‚Äì39. Members of her family claim that she did not make her illnesses known.Miles, Obedience, p. 43. In 1964, von Speyr went blind, and her health slipped into sharp decline. Von Balthasar, who was often present through this time, recounts: ‚ÄúThe last months in bed were a continuous, merciless torture, which she bore with great equanimity, always concerned about the others and constantly apologetic about causing me so much trouble.‚ÄùVon Balthasar, First Glance, p. 45. On September 17, 1967, the feast of Saint Hildegard of Bingen, von Speyr died in her home in Basel. One of her last phrases was ‚ÄúQue c‚Äôest beau de mourir‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúHow beautiful it is to die‚Äù‚Äîand her dying words were \\"Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\"Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 89. She was buried in Basel five days later on her sixty-fifth birthday.Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 45.  Theology and mysticism  Handmaid of the Lord (Magd des Herrn, 1948), one of the first books published by von Speyr on Johannes Verlag She is considered by many to have been a mystic and is reputed to have had supernatural experiences of, for example, the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Trinity, a number of saints (including John the Evangelist and Ignatius of Loyola), Christ's Passion, and Hell, as well as incidences of bilocation and stigmata.Von Balthasar, First Glance. Aside from her confessor, nobody knew of these reported phenomena during her lifetime, including members of her own religious community.Miles, Obedience, p. 20. As a doctor, she was also believed to be connected with a number of unexplained healings of patients,Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 34. often taking on severe penances as a way of sharing in the suffering of others. Adrienne von Speyr's theological writings‚Äîwhich were generally transcribed, copy edited, and published by Hans Urs von Balthasar‚Äîtreat a wide range of topics in Catholic spirituality. As L. M. Miles notes in the journal First Things, most of her books are scriptural commentaries and \\"there is a biblical rather than a dogmatic or systematic organization to her work.\\" These include John (in four volumes), Mark, Letter to the Colossians, Letter to the Ephesians, Three Women and the Lord, Bergpredigt [The Sermon on the Mount], Gleichnisse des Herrn [Parables of the Lord], Die Sch√∂pfung [Creation], Achtzehn Psalmen [Eighteen Psalms], Isaia [Isaiah], and Elijah, among others. She also wrote meditations on Mary (Handmaid of the Lord and Mary in the Redemption), on the Mass (The Holy Mass), on the sacrament of confession (Confession), on the prophets (The Mission of the Prophets), on death (The Mystery of Death), on Christ's Passion (The Passion from Within and The Cross: Word and Sacrament). Some prominent features in her thought include the centrality of Christian obedience and of the Marian fiat, an understanding of God as ever-greater, a Trinitarian approach to prayer, humility and self- effacement as essential Christian attitudes, the attitude of Bereitschaft (\\"readiness\\" or \\"disponsibility\\") before God, the potential unity between Christian action in the world and action according to God's will, and the reality of Christ's descent into Hell on Holy Saturday.Von Balthasar, First Glance, pp. 49‚Äì62.Miles, Obedience, passim. The Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola imbue much of her thought. Von Speyr's more immediately mystical writings were not released until 1985 and vary in theme and style. The work Book of All Saints gives inner portraits of many saints and historical figures in terms of their prayer lives; one Dominican scholar has expressed doubts about her critical description of Saint Thomas Aquinas in the first of her two entries on him. In another posthumous text, Kreuz und H√∂lle, von Speyr relates her experiences of the Passion and of the descent into Hell, giving illustrations of the metaphysical nature of damnation as isolation and \\"total depersonalization,\\" in Professor Matthew Sutton's phrase. Some scholars have interpreted these visions as suggesting universalism, or a belief that Hell is empty, but other scholars insist that this is a misreading of the text; Hans Urs von Balthasar himself rejects the universalist reading, understanding von Speyr's experience of Hell as \\"so real that, in view of it, it would be ridiculous and blasphemous to speak of the nonexistence of hell or even just of apokatastasis [universalism] in the 'systematic' sense.\\"Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 64. There are critics who dispute the authenticity of von Speyr's visions on other grounds, citing features such as apparent changes of personality and voice and the use of sarcasm, although von Balthasar, who originally related these phenomena, believes these episodes had a pedagogical purpose, to form him in humility as a spiritual director.Von Balthasar, First Glance, pp. 66‚Äì67. Reception and influence In 1985, the Vatican hosted a colloquium on \\"Adrienne von Speyr e la sua missione ecclesiale\\" [Adrienne von Speyr and her ecclesial mission], with presentations by Angelo Scola, Antonio Sicari, Marc Ouellet, Joseph Fessio, S.J., and others. Pope John Paul II said in his closing address to the participants: > I would like to take this opportunity to greet the members of the Community > of Saint John, which owes its very foundation to a sublime inspiration on > the part of Adrienne. She had a special love for ‚Äúthe disciple whom Jesus > loved,‚Äù the last, most profound expositor, as she saw him, of the mystery of > Jesus, of the Father‚Äôs love for the world, and of the Holy Spirit whose sure > hand guides us into the full light of the revelation of Father and Son. Her > insight into the inmost communion of faith and love uniting the Mother of > Jesus and the one disciple who persevered with her under the Cross was no > less profound; it was here that she glimpsed the virginal origin of the > Church that would be entrusted to Peter‚Äôs care. May this spirituality, which > Adrienne embodied with such exemplary vigor, help you to incarnate ever > better your own commitment to live in accord with Church and Gospel in the > midst of the realities of the contemporary world. A second symposium was held at the Vatican in 2017 entitled \\"Adrienne von Speyr: A Woman in the Heart of the 20th Century.\\" The acts of the conference are being published through the Italian press Edizioni Cantagalli. Poet and playwright T. S. Eliot said of von Speyr's meditations on John, \\"Von Speyr's book does not lend itself to any classification that I can think of. It is not dogmatic theology; still less is it exegesis.... There is nothing to do but to submit oneself to it; if the reader emerges without having been crushed by it, he will find himself strengthened and exhilarated by a new experience of Christian sensibility.\\" Theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar claims that most of his own work was primarily inspired by his collaborator von Speyr and her \\"experiential dogmatics\\".Dietlind Langner, Marco A. Sorace, Peter Zimmerling (2008) Gottesfreundschaft: christliche Mystik im Zeitgespr√§ch p.259 quotation: He puts it in starker terms in First Glance at Adrienne von Speyr: \\"On the whole I received far more from Adrienne, theologically, than she from me.... As her confessor and spiritual director, I observed her interior life most closely, yet in twenty-seven years I never had the least doubt about the authentic mission that was hers.... [H]er work appears far more important to me than mine.... I am convinced that when her works are made available, those who are in a position to judge will concur with me about their value and will thank God that he has granted such graces to the Church in our time.‚ÄùVon Speyr, First Glance, p. 15. The spirituality of Adrienne von Speyr is a pillar of the formation program at the Casa Balthasar, a house of discernment in Rome founded under the auspices of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, and at Heart's Home, an international Catholic missionary organization. Excerpts from the works of Adrienne von Speyr are published regularly in the Catholic monthly Magnificat. In 2018, French filmmaker Marie Viloin‚Äîdirector of documentaries about Bernadette Soubirous and Faustina Kowalska‚Äîproduced the half-hour feature Adrienne von Speyr (1902‚Äì1967): Sur la terre comme au ciel as a segment of the program Le Jour du Seigneur, broadcast by the national French TV network France 2.

Background Born in Owensboro, Kentucky, Maglinger was an American artist who specialized in historical, nature-based paintings. His siblings included two sisters and eight brothers. After World War II, under the GI bill, Maglinger entered the Kansas City Art Institute. He received a diploma in Graphic Arts in 1949 and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1950. He also held a diploma in Commercial Art from the Famous Artist's School in Westport, Connecticut. Maglinger was Manager of Creative Services for Texas Gas Transmission Corporation from 1956 to 1967 and Art Director of the Evansville Printing Corporation from 1967 till his retirement in 1988. More than twenty of Maglinger's paintings were reproduced as limited edition prints. Over 17,000 of these prints have been sold nationally. His Regional Art Series, popularized in the 1980s, was well received and won wide acclaim. A recipient of numerous awards, the artist had been honored with one-man shows and his originals are in the collections of a number of midwest art patrons. Maglinger was given a special medallion from the Indiana State Museum for the painting \\"Foggy Morn.\\" His painting \\"Quiet Time,\\" appeared on the \\"Artists of America\\" calendar in 1995 and he completed historical paintings of Ohio River for the Casino Aztar Evansville riverboat in 1999. He is also admired by and inspired many local Indiana artists including Evelyn Steinkuhl. Although Maglinger was better known for his paintings, he had proven capabilities in commercial and graphic art, wrote and illustrated two books and was the holder of several patents. Maglinger's graphic art ranged from cartoons to rendering of court trials for newspapers and television. This, along with his paintings of wildlife, landscapes portraits and illustrations, revealed a diversity of talent. Collections The largest collection of Maglinger's original artwork is held between the Indiana State Museum and Maglinger's sons.

Most of New York is dominated by farms, forests, rivers, mountains, and lakes. New York's Adirondack Park is larger than any U.S. National Park in the contiguous United States. Niagara Falls, on the Niagara River as it flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, is a popular attraction. The Hudson River begins near Lake Tear of the Clouds and flows south through the eastern part of the state without draining lakes George or Champlain. Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain, whose northern end extends into Canada, where it drains into the Richelieu River and then the St. Lawrence. Four of New York City's five boroughs are on the three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River: Manhattan Island, Staten Island, and Brooklyn and Queens on Long Island. \\"Upstate\\" is a common term for New York counties north of suburban Westchester, Rockland and Dutchess counties. Upstate New York typically includes the Catskill Mountains or areas North of the Catskill Mountains, the Capital district, The Adirondacks, the Erie Canal, Lake Champlain, Otsego Lake, Oneida Lake; rivers such as the Delaware, Genesee, Mohawk, and Susquehanna. The highest elevation in New York is Mount Marcy of the Adirondack Mountains. New York is the 27th largest state . Location and size Location of New York in the United States New York is located in the northeastern United States, in the Mid-Atlantic Census Bureau division. New York covers an area of 54,556 square miles (141,299 km2) making it the 27th largest state by total area (but 30th by land area). The state borders six U.S. states: Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the south, and Connecticut, Rhode Island (across Long Island Sound), Massachusetts, and Vermont to the east. New York also borders the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec to the north. Additionally, New York touches the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, and two of the Great Lakes: Lake Erie to the west and Lake Ontario to the northwest. Geology :Main article: Geology of New York (state) New York is part of the Marcellus Shale, a gas-rich rock formation which also extends across Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Topography Relief map of New York (USGS) New York lies upon the portion of the Appalachian Mountains where the mountains generally assume the character of hills and finally sink to a level of the lowlands that surround the great depression filled by Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. Three distinct mountain masses can be identified in the state. The most easterly of these ranges‚Äîa continuation of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia‚Äîenters the state from New Jersey and extends northeast through Rockland and Orange counties to the Hudson River, continuing on the east side of that river as the highlands of Putnam and Dutchess counties. A northerly extension of the same range passes into the Green Mountains of western Massachusetts and Vermont. This range is known in New York as the Hudson Highlands. The highest peaks are above sea level. The rocks that compose these mountains are principally primitive or igneous, and the mountains themselves are rough, rocky, precipitous, and unfit for cultivation. The second series of mountains enters the state from Pennsylvania and extends northeast through Sullivan, Ulster, and Greene counties, terminating and culminating in the Catskill Mountains west of the Hudson. The highest peaks are above sea level. The Shawangunk Mountains, a high and continuous ridge extending between Sullivan and Orange counties and into the southern part of Ulster County, is the extreme eastern range of this series. The Helderberg and Hellibark Mountains are spurs extending north from the main range into Albany and Schoharie counties. This whole mountain system is principally composed of rocks of the New York system above the Medina sandstone. The summits are generally crowned with red sandstone and with the conglomerate of the coal measures. The declivities are steep and rocky, and a large share of the surface is too rough for cultivation. The northeast Appalachian Mountains The third mountainous region, occupying the northeast part of the state, is known as the Adirondack Mountains. The region is bounded to the south by the Mohawk River, south of which the highlands become part of the Allegheny Plateau, in the form of broad, irregular hills, broken by the deep ravines of streams. The valley of the Mohawk separates the Allegheny Plateau to the south from the highlands leading to the Adirondacks to the north, reaching its narrowest point in the neighborhood of Little Falls, the Noses, and other places. North of the Mohawk the highlands extend northeast in several distinct ranges, all terminating upon Lake Champlain. The culminating point of the whole system, and the highest mountain in the state, is Mount Marcy, standing above sea level. The rocks of all this region are principally of igneous origin, and the mountains are usually wild, rugged, and rocky. A large share of the surface is entirely unfit for cultivation, but the region is rich in minerals, and especially in an excellent variety of iron ore. Landscape regions of New York In western New York, a series of hills forming spurs of the Allegheny Mountains enter the state from Pennsylvania and occupy the entire southern half of the west part of the state. An irregular line extending through the southerly counties forms the watershed that separates the northern and southern drainage; and from it the surface gradually declines northward until it finally terminates in the level of Lake Ontario. The portion of the state lying south of this watershed and occupying the greater part of the two southerly tiers of counties is entirely occupied by these hills. Along the Pennsylvania line they are usually abrupt and are separated by narrow ravines, but toward the north their summits become broader and less broken. A considerable portion of the highland region is too steep for profitable cultivation and is best adapted to grazing. The highest summits in Allegany and Cattaraugus counties are above sea level. From the summits of the watershed, the highlands usually descend toward Lake Ontario in a series of terraces, the edges of which are outcrops of different rocks beneath the surface. These terraces are usually smooth, and, although inclined toward the north, the inclination is generally so slight that they appear level. Between the hills of the south and the level land of the north is a beautiful rolling region, the ridges gradually declining toward the north. In that part of the state, south of the most eastern mountain range, the surface is generally level or broken by low hills. In Manhattan and Westchester County, these hills are principally composed of primitive rocks. The surface of Long Island is generally level or gently undulating. A ridge high, composed of sand, gravel, and clay, extends east and west across the island north of its center. Rivers and lakes Mohawk and Hudson River watersheds The river system of the state has two general divisions. The first is the streams tributary to the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. The second are those tributaries that flow in a general southerly direction. The watershed divide that separates these two systems extends in an irregular line eastward from Lake Erie, through the southern tier of counties to near the northeast corner of Chemung County. It then turns northeast to the Adirondack Mountains in Essex County, then southeast to the east extremity of Lake George, and then nearly due east to the east border of the state. The northerly division has five general subdivisions. The most westerly of these comprises all the streams flowing into Lake Erie and the Niagara River and those flowing into Lake Ontario west of the Genesee River. In Chautauqua County, the streams are short and rapid, as the watershed approaches within a few miles of Lake Erie. Cattaraugus, Buffalo, Tonawanda, and Oak Orchard creeks are the most important streams in this division. Buffalo Creek is chiefly noted for forming Buffalo Harbor at its mouth; and the Tonawanda for from its mouth was once used for canal navigation. Oak Orchard and other creeks flowing into Lake Ontario descend from the interior in a series of rapids, affording a large amount of waterpower. The Finger Lakes Region The second subdivision comprises the Genesee River and its tributaries. The Genesee rises in the northern part of Pennsylvania and flows in a generally northerly direction to Lake Ontario. Its upper course is through a narrow valley bordered by steep, rocky hills. Upon the line of Wyoming and Livingston counties, it breaks through a mountain barrier in a deep gorge and forms the Portage Falls. Below this point the course of the river is through a valley wide and bordered by banks high. At Rochester it flows over the precipitous edges of the Niagara limestone, forming the Upper Genesee Falls; and below it flows over the edge of the Medina sandstone, forming the Lower Genesee Falls. The principal tributaries of this stream are Canaseraga, Honeoye, and Conesus creeks from the south, and Oatka and Black creeks from the west. Honeoye, Canadice, Hemlock, and Conesus lakes‚Äîfour of the Finger Lakes‚Äîlie within the Genesee Basin. The third subdivision includes the Oswego River and its tributaries, and the small streams flowing into Lake Ontario between the Genesee and Oswego rivers. The basin of the Oswego includes most of the inland lakes, which form a peculiar feature of the landscape in the interior of the state. The principal of these lakes are Cayuga, Seneca, Canandaigua, Skaneateles, Crooked, and Owasco lakes, all occupying long, narrow valleys, and extending from the level land in the center far into the highland region of the south (many of those lakes just mentioned are also part of the Finger Lakes). The valleys they occupy appear like immense ravines formed by some tremendous force that tore the solid rocks from their original beds, from the general level of the surrounding summits, down to the present bottoms of the lakes. Oneida and Onondaga lakes occupy level land in the northeast part of the Oswego Basin. Mud Creek, the most westerly branch of the Oswego River, takes its rise in Ontario County, flows northeast into Wayne County, where it unites with Canandaigua Outlet and takes the name of Clyde River; then it flows east to the west line of Cayuga County, where it empties into the Seneca River. This latter stream, made up of the outlets of Seneca and Cayuga Lakes, from this point flows in a northeasterly course, and receives successively the outlets of Owasco, Skaneateles, Onondaga, and Oneida lakes. From the mouth of the last-named stream it takes the name Oswego River, and its course is nearly due north to Lake Ontario. The fourth subdivision includes the streams flowing into Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River east of the mouth of the Oswego. The principal of these are the Salmon, Black, Oswegatchie, Grasse, and Raquette rivers. The water is usually very dark, being colored with iron and the vegetation of swamps. The fifth subdivision includes all the streams flowing into Lakes George and Champlain. They are mostly mountain torrents, frequently interrupted by cascades. The principal streams are the Chazy, Saranac, and Ausable rivers, and Wood Creek. Deep strata of Tertiary clay extend along the shores of Lake Champlain and Wood Creek. The water of most of the streams in this region is colored by the iron over which it flows. Susquehanna River watershed The second general division of the river system of the state includes the basins of the Allegheny, Susquehanna, Delaware, and Hudson. The Allegheny Basin embraces the southerly half of Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties and the southwest corner of Allegany County. The Allegheny River enters the state from the south in the southeast corner of Cattaraugus County, flows in nearly a semicircle, with its outward curve toward the north, and flows out of the state in the southwest part of the same county. It receives several tributaries from the north and east. These streams mostly flow in deep ravines bordered by steep, rocky hillsides. The watershed between this basin and Lake Erie approaches within a few miles of the lake, and is elevated above it. Lake Champlain at sunrise The Susquehanna Basin occupies about one-third of the south border of the state. The river takes its rise in Otsego Lake, and, flowing southwest to the Pennsylvania line, receives Charlotte River from the south and the Unadilla River from the north. After a course of a few miles in Pennsylvania, it again enters New York and flows in a general westerly direction to near the western border of Tioga County, whence it turns south and again enters Pennsylvania. Its principal tributary from the north is the Chenango River. The Tioga River enters New York from Pennsylvania near the eastern border of Steuben County, flows north, receives the Canisteo River from the west and the Cohocton River from the north. From the mouth of the latter, the stream takes the name Chemung River, and flows in a southeast direction, into the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, a few miles south of the state line. The upper course of these streams is generally through deep ravines bordered by steep hillsides, but below they are bordered by wide intervales. Delaware River watershed The Delaware Basin occupies Delaware and Sullivan counties and portions of several of the adjacent counties. The north or principal branch of the river rises in the northeast part of Delaware County and flows southwest to near the Pennsylvania line; then it turns southwest and forms the boundary of the state to the line of New Jersey. Its principal branches are the Pepacton and Neversink rivers. These streams all flow in deep, narrow ravines bordered by steep, rocky hills. The Palisades along the Hudson River The basin of the Hudson occupies about two-thirds of the east border of the state, and a large territory extending into the interior. The remote sources of the Hudson are among the highest peaks of the Adirondacks, more than above sea level. Several of the little lakes that form reservoirs of the Upper Hudson are above sea level. The stream rapidly descends through the narrow defiles into Warren County, where it receives from the east the outlet of Schroon Lake, and the Sacandaga River from the west. Below the mouth of the latter the river turns eastward, and breaks through the barrier of the Luzerne Mountains in a series of rapids and falls. At Fort Edward it again turns south and flows with a rapid current, frequently interrupted by falls, to Troy, from the ocean. At this place the river falls into an estuary, where its current is affected by the tide; and from this place to its mouth it is a broad, deep, sluggish stream. About from its mouth the Hudson breaks through the rocky barrier of the highlands, forming the most easterly of the Appalachian Mountain ranges; and along its lower course it is bordered on the west by a nearly perpendicular wall of basaltic rock high, known as The Palisades. Above Troy, the Hudson receives the Hoosic River from the east and the Mohawk River from the west. The former stream rises in western Massachusetts and Vermont, and the latter near the center of New York. At Little Falls and The Noses, the Mohawk breaks through mountain barriers in a deep, rocky ravine; and at Cohoes, about from its mouth, it flows down a perpendicular precipice of . Below Troy the tributaries of the Hudson are all comparatively small streams. South of the highlands the river spreads out into a wide expanse known as Haverstraw Bay. A few small streams upon the extreme eastern border of the state flow eastward into the Housatonic River, and several small branches of the Passaic River rise in the southern part of Rockland County. Lake Erie forms a portion of the western boundary of the state. It is long, with an average width of , and it lies mostly west of the bounds of the state. It is above Lake Ontario, above sea level, and has an average depth of . The greatest depth ever obtained by soundings is . The harbors upon the lake are Buffalo, Silver Creek, Dunkirk, and Barcelona. St. Lawrence River watershed Niagara Falls is along the course of the Niagara River. The Niagara River, forming the outlet of Lake Erie, is long, and, on average, more than a mile wide. About below Lake Erie the rapids commence; and further below are Niagara Falls. For below the falls the river has a rapid course between perpendicular, rocky banks, high, but below it emerges from the highlands and flows to Lake Ontario in a broad, deep, and majestic current. Lake Ontario forms a part of the northern boundary to the western half of the state. Its greatest length is and its greatest width is . It is above sea level, and its greatest depth is . Its principal harbors on the American shore are Lewiston, Youngstown, Port Genesee, Sodus and Little Sodus bays, Oswego, Sackets Harbor, and Cape Vincent. The St. Lawrence River forms the outlet of the lake and the northern boundary of the state to the east line of St. Lawrence County. It is a broad, deep river, flowing with a strong yet sluggish current until it passes the limits of this state. In the upper part of its course it encloses a great number of small islands, known as the Thousand Islands. The surfaces of the Great Lakes are subject to variations of level, probably due to prevailing winds, unequal amounts of rain, and evaporation. The greatest difference known in Lake Erie is , and in Lake Ontario . The time of these variations is irregular, and the interval between the extremes often extends through several years. A sudden rise and fall of several feet has been noticed upon Lake Ontario at rare intervals, produced by some unknown cause. State parks Two major parks in the state are the Adirondack Park and Catskill Park. New York has many state parks and two major forest preserves. The Adirondack Park, roughly the size of the state of Vermont and the largest state park in the United States, was established in 1892 and given state constitutional protection in 1894. The thinking that led to the creation of the park first appeared in George Perkins Marsh's Man and Nature, published in 1864. Marsh argued that deforestation could lead to desertification; referring to the clearing of once-lush lands surrounding the Mediterranean, he asserted \\"the operation of causes set in action by man has brought the face of the earth to a desolation almost as complete as that of the moon.\\"* Full Text of Man Of Nature from the Library of Congress The Catskill Park was protected in legislation passed in 1885, which declared that its land was to be conserved and never put up for sale or lease. Consisting of of land, the park is a habitat for bobcats, minks and fishers with some 400 black bears living in the region. The state operates numerous campgrounds, and maintains over of multi- use trails. http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/5265.html \\"Catskill Forest Preserve\\" See also *Appalachia *Glacial Lake Albany  References   External links  * ","title":"Geography of New York (state)"},{"id":"9429999","text":"Atle Thowsen (born 24 November 1940) is a historian and the Director of the Bergen Maritime Museum and served as president of the International Commission for Maritime History from 2000 to 2005.

Milliken batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Majorsville, West Virginia. Milliken pitched in the minor leagues with Fort Worth (1948‚Äì49) and Montreal (1950) before joining the military from 1951 to 1952. After being discharged, he helped the Brooklyn Dodgers to clinch the 1953 National League pennant with an 8‚Äì4 mark, 65 strikeouts, 117 innings, and a 3.37 ERA in 37 appearances, including 10 starts. He faced the New York Yankees in the World Series of that year and pitched two innings of shutout relief. In 1954 he went 5‚Äì2 with two saves in 24 games, three as a starter, as he recorded a 4.02 ERA in a league where the pitchers averaged 4.07. After that, he suffered arm problems and did not return to the major leagues. From 1955 to 1956 Milliken divided his playing time between Fort Worth and Montreal. Following his playing retirement, he returned to the majors as a bullpen and pitching coach with the St. Louis Cardinals (1965‚Äì70, 1976). He is given credit in the SABR biography of Jim Willoughby for straightening out his delivery in 1975, while serving as a pitching instructor when Willoughby was with the Tulsa Oilers.

They were managed and produced by Charles Greene and Brian Stone, two Sunset Strip impresarios who also managed Sonny & Cher, Buffalo Springfield and Iron Butterfly. History The Cake formed in New York in 1966, starting out as an a cappella vocal group singing at Steve Paul's The Scene. Barooshian and Morillo both appeared in You Are What You Eat, a 1968 documentary film produced by Peter Yarrow. In the film, Barooshian performed the Sonny & Cher hit \\"I Got You Babe\\" with Tiny Tim. She sang the male part, while Tiny Tim sang the female. What set The Cake apart from other girl groups of the time is that they recorded their own material, as well as a number of R&B; standards. Their own songs were in the vein of 1960s baroque pop with intricate madrigal-style vocal harmonies. They released two albums on Decca Records, The Cake (1967) and A Slice Of Cake (1968). Both were recorded at the Gold Star Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Their debut single was the Jack Nitzsche and Jackie De Shannon penned song, \\"Baby, That's Me\\". The production of the song, which was arranged by Harold Battiste, mimicked the Wall of Sound technique created by Nitzsche and Phil Spector. Billboard named the song #64 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. Barooshian also contributed back-up vocals to \\"Why Are We Sleeping?\\", a track on The Soft Machine, the 1968 debut album by the British psychedelic rock band of the same name. Following the break-up of The Cake in 1968, Jacobs and Barooshian toured with Dr John, who was one of the session musicians on their albums, and subsequently moved to the UK, where they became part of Ginger Baker's Air Force. Barooshian also recorded an album in Japan with Tetsu Yamauchi. Jacobs married Chris Wood of the English group Traffic in 1969.

According to his obituary \\"He was the original projector of the Liverpool & Manchester and other railways, and may with truth be considered as the father of the railway system, as he surveyed numerous lines at his own expense at a time when such an innovation was generally ridiculed.\\"Obituary (May 1837). The Gentleman's Magazine. Life and career =Early life= The Yew Trees in Henley-in- Arden where James lived when first married. William James was born in Henley- in-Arden in Warwickshire in 1771, the second of the seven children of William James, a solicitor from Moseley near Birmingham, and his wife Mary, who came from a wealthy and well-connected family in Kings Norton. The young James was educated at The King's School, Warwick (Now Warwick School); at another school in Winson Green, Birmingham and at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn in London. After training and qualifying as a solicitor in Birmingham, he returned to Henley-in-Arden around 1797 to work in his father's practice. On 4 September 1793 in Wootton Wawen, a mile south of Henley-in-Arden, James married Dinah Tarleton, the daughter of local landowners. The couple settled at the Yew Trees in Henley-in-Arden High Street and enjoyed a high social standing locally, mixing socially with landowners and aristocracy from across the county. =Land agent= James' father was a wealthy man and a local Justice of the Peace, but the share price collapse that accompanied the panic of 1797 led to increased financial pressures for the family and the solicitors' practice. In 1798 the younger William James started a new career as a land agent, initially managing the estate of the Dewes family of Wellesbourne Hall. He supervised estates in the West Midlands and beyond for, amongst others, the Dewes family of Wellesbourne Hall, Warwickshire; the Earl of Warwick, of Warwick Castle (but with property widely distributed); the Yates family of Lancashire; the Earl of Dartmouth at Sandwell Park, West Bromwich; the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth in London; and the Agar family of Lanhydrock House in Cornwall. James sought unsuccessfully for coal in East Sussex but successfully operated coal mines in his own right in south Staffordshire. Having an understanding of geology, James invariably advised his clients to concentrate on realising the mineral wealth of their estates and it was in this connection that he first began to propose railways, including, in 1802/03, an early version of the Bolton and Leigh Railway. =Railway work= James first became interested in the potential for railways and planning possible routes in 1799. As early as 1806 he had realised that the horse-drawn railways that had been a common means of transporting goods in and around collieries for almost two centuries could form the basis of a national system of public transportation. Uniquely among early railway pioneers, he saw the value of railways in rapidly transporting passengers as well as freight and minerals. It seems likely that in 1808 James attended the demonstration running of Richard Trevithick‚Äôs steam locomotive Catch me who can in London; certainly at this time he began to consider the long-term development of this means of transport, although he recognised that something more durable than cast iron would be needed for the rails themselves. For example, at the time of the Napoleonic Wars of 1815, he wrote to the Prince Regent proposing a railway link between the two principal naval dockyards at Chatham and Portsmouth which in peacetime could be used for passenger traffic; and in 1820/21 he promoted a Central Junction Railway from Stratford-upon-Avon to Paddington in London. In 1821 he made several trips to inspect railway developments in the Northumberland coalfield and met George Stephenson of Killingworth Colliery, his son Robert and the ironfounder William Losh. This resulted in an agreement for James to market the Stephenson/Losh patent locomotive (which James branded as the Land-Agent type) in England south of the Humber-Mersey line, with a supplementary agreement for Stephenson and Losh to use the patent for multitubular locomotive boilers taken out by William Henry James, William James‚Äôs son. In 1822 James, with his brother-in-law Paul Padley as chief surveyor, began on behalf of Joseph Sandars, a Liverpool businessman, and others to survey a route for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in Lancashire; and in 1823-4 he surveyed three possible routes for the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway in Kent. He was also during this period advocating railways as an extension to the Grand Surrey Canal and as an alternative to the (never-built) London and Cambridge Junction Canal; and steam locomotives for the Surrey Iron Railway. Stephenson, however, was never prepared to produce locomotives for James to demonstrate to potential clients and no sales were made through his agency. =Misfortunes= In 1822-3, James spent time in the King‚Äôs Bench Prison in Southwark for debt (during which time he wrote a scheme for a network of railways in the south of England) and later in 1823 he was adjudged bankrupt. The distractions caused by this, by his involvement in so many projects simultaneously, and by bouts of illness, tended to prevent James from personally bringing to fruition any of the railway projects he had helped to initiate. In 1824, George Stephenson, assisted by Padley, was appointed surveyor to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, largely utilising the route projected by James, and in the following year Stephenson was made engineer of the Canterbury and Whitstable, using James‚Äôs least preferred route. James‚Äôs visionary steam-worked Central Junction Railway emerged as the horse-worked Stratford and Moreton Tramway opened in 1826 with John Urpeth Rastrick as surveyor and Robert Stephenson senior (George‚Äôs brother) in an engineering capacity. =Waterways= Although recognising that railways were the coming mode of transport, James inherited inland waterways interests from his father. He was on the managing committee of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, seeing it through to completion in 1816, including the money-saving proposal to construct the Edstone Aqueduct in cast iron; and he also held shares in the Upper Avon Navigation. =Later career= In 1827 James moved to Bodmin in Cornwall primarily to improve the estates of Anna-Maria Agar of Lanhydrock. He had plans to develop the ports of Devoran and Truro and build a railway from Fowey to Padstow, none of which came to fruition under his management. Following a winter journey by mail coach he contracted pneumonia of which he died at Bodmin early in 1837. =Personal life= James was a freemason, a member of the Royal Society of Arts, and, during the Napoleonic Wars, had been an officer in the Warwickshire Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry. He married his first wife, Dinah Tarleton, in 1793 and they had eight children. Following her death in 1830, he married Elizabeth Butt, 36 years his junior, in 1832, and they had two more daughters. It was said of him that \\"though corpulent, his manners were elegant and easy.\\" William James and his eldest son William Henry James (1796‚Äì1873) were patentees of a number of inventions related to the improvement of transport. Reputation Henley-in-Arden, Memorial plaque The restored tramway wagon on display in Stratford-upon-Avon Partly because he was never acknowledged by George Stephenson (although the younger Robert and other engineers remained sympathetic), James received little recognition for his work and written memorials to Parliament for financial help both by himself around 1826 and, after his death, on behalf of his children in 1846 were abandoned. Annoyed by her father‚Äôs treatment in Samuel Smiles‚Äôs biographies of Stephenson one of James‚Äôs daughters, Ellen Paine, wrote a defence of him in which, as even a sympathetic historian, L. T. C. Rolt, concludes, she \\"defeats her own object by overstating her case\\"Rolt, L.T.C. Introduction to 1961 reprint. and it was not until 2007 that a substantive biography appeared. He is commemorated by a plaque on a former residence in Henley-in-Arden and a scheme to restore a Stratford and Moreton Tramway wagon in Stratford.

Coates was born in Brandon, County Durham, England. His parents, George and Mary Coates, emigrated to the United States in 1881 and initially settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1882 the family relocated to Pueblo, Colorado, where his father was employed as an engineer at the steelworks. Coates briefly worked in the mines before entering the publishing and printing industry. He worked for several newspapers in Colorado including the Pueblo Evening Star and Rocky Mountain News and founded several others, including the Pueblo Press, Colorado Chronicle and Pueblo Courier. He married Sadie B. Pearce on 14 October 1890 and a daughter, Hazel Marie, was born on 1 February 1893. He served as secretary of the Colorado State Federation of Labor between 1897 and 1899 and president between 1899 and 1901. He testified before the Industrial Commission as part of their investigation into mining on 14 July 1899. Coates was elected Lieutenant Governor of Colorado on a fusion ticket, having received the nominations of the Democratic, Populist and Silver Republican parties. In 1901, Lieutenant Governor Coates volunteered, and was dispatched by Colorado Governor James Orman, to be part of a commission sent to Telluride to investigate an uprising of miners from the Western Federation of Miners during a strike. A shooting war was triggered when one of the strikers, believed to have been unarmed, had been shot through the throat by a deputized mine guard. In spite of intense pressure from others, Coates helped to persuade the governor not to send the Colorado National Guard. The commission was able to effect a settlement between the miners and the company, negotiating between union leader Vincent St. John and the Smuggler-Union Mine Company's general manager, Arthur L. Collins.The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899‚Äì1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 78-79, and 85-87. In 1903, Coates was elected vice president of the American Labor Union and became president of the union in 1905 following the resignation of Dan McDonald. In this role he attended the founding convention of the Industrial Workers of the World.Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pp. 78. Coates was offered the presidency of that organization, but declined to accept it.Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pp. 84. The IWW later abolished the office of the presidency. In his autobiography, Big Bill Haywood credited Coates with suggesting a slogan for the IWW: an injury to one is an injury to all.William Dudley Haywood, The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood,1929, pp. 186. The slogan has since been used by a number of labor organizations. Between 1904 and 1906, Coates resided in Wallace, Idaho, where he printed and published the Idaho State Tribune. Coates moved to Spokane, Washington in 1906, where he established Coates, Hughes & Coates publishing and printing company with his brother William and Harley L. Hughes. In 1911, he was elected city commissioner for public works on the socialist ticket and served in this role until 1914. He then moved to Fargo, North Dakota, where he served as editor of the Nonpartisan Leader, the official publication of the Nonpartisan League, between 1915 and 1917. Coates was a member of the Socialist Party of America for most of his life. He left the party over its pacifist policies and served as chairman of the short-lived National Party during World War I. In the 1920s, Coates moved to Hollywood, California, where he published the North Hollywood Sun. He collapsed and died at his home in North Hollywood, California in 1933 and is buried in the Hollywood Forever cemetery.

Some Jewish leaders held Levy responsible for the victory. According to New Orleans Jewish Federation director Jane Buchsbaum, \\"there was a strong belief that Mordechai's interference helped create those 227 votes.\\" Leonard Zeskind of the Center for Democratic Renewal, which monitors right-wing extremism, said Levy \\"went down there and carried on like a character out of central casting for a crazed New York Jew. I'm sure there were 227 people who voted for Duke just to get at Mordechai Levy. I hold him personally responsible for the election of David Duke.\\" Rutgers Levy and the JDO's involvement led to accusations that the group inflamed divisions at Rutgers University in 1995, where African American students had protested against comments made by then-President Francis L. Lawrence that were perceived as anti-Black. The JDO accused the protesting Black students of themselves being racist and anti-Semitic. Levy's involvement was met apprehension by some members of the Rutgers Jewish community. Rabbi Norman Weitzner of Rutgers Hillel felt there was no anti-Semitism involved and noted \\"The JDO sees anti-Semitism at the drop of a hat, when it may not actually exist.\\" The interim director of Rutgers Hillel said at the time that Levy \\"thinks he's going to wake up the Jewish students. What's going to happen is that he's going to start a racial war.\\"Raff, Lisa. JDO refuels racial fire at Rutgers University. MetroWest Jewish News.

It's a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the persona expresses his love towards a young man. It is the second of a group of three sonnets (97 to 99) to treat a separation of the speaker from his beloved. Paraphrase We were apart during the spring, when everything feels young, even aged Saturn; however, none of the beauty I saw around me could bring me into sympathy with my surroundings. I could not admire the lily or the rose, since these were to me only images of you. Thus, it still seemed winter to me, since you were away. Structure Sonnet 98 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 4th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him. (98.4) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. The 12th line potentially exhibits two metrical variations: first, an initial reversal, second, the rightward movement of the fourth ictus (resulting in a four- position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó √ó / / Drawn after you, you pattern of all those. (98.12) The same variations, in the same positions, are also potentially present in line 5. However, if the repetition of the word \\"nor\\" draws special emphasis from the reader, both positions would be affected, resulting in the somewhat more regular: √ó / √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell (98.5) The meter demands a few variant pronunciations: line 3's \\"spirit\\" is one syllable (possibly pronounced as spear't, sprite, sprit, or spurtBooth 2000, p. 262.), line 6's \\"different\\" is two syllables and \\"flowers\\" is one. Source and analysis As Sidney Lee notes, this poem, like most Renaissance sonnets on similar themes, derives ultimately from Petrarch's sonnet 42; he cites examples from Surrey and Sidney. Edward Dowden notes a resemblance to Spenser's Amoretti 64. G. Wilson Knight connects the rose and lily of this poem to what he sees as a pattern of flower symbolism in the cycle.

The film revolves around a small-town church organist named Scot Webster (Philip Terry) attempts to save his sister, Susan (Ellen Drew) from the clutches of big city gangster W. S. Bruhl (Paul Lukas). When one of Bruhl's gang members is double-crossed in Bruhl's rented room, and killed by a gunman, the man tosses him the gun and disappears. Scot is tried and executed. A scientist (George Zucco) salvages his brain and transplants it into a gorilla. Using the strength of his new, bestial body, Webster begins stalking the gangsters to exact his revenge. Cast Production The Monster and the Girl was developed under the title of Dead On Arrival and was written as D.O.A..After the release of Michael Curtiz's film The Walking Dead in 1936, a few films combined genre themes of crime films and science-fiction horror. These included The Man They Could Not Hang , Before I Hang, and Black Friday all which starred Boris Karloff and featured individuals who return from being dead to exact revenge. The Monster and the Girl used these themes but applied it to a monster movie theme for The Monster and the Girl. The censorship board rejected original story ideas due to the plot dealing with white slavery and homicide. The script was changed by to imply Susan's entrapment by Munn. This also changed Susan being forced into prostitution and working as a bar hostess to pay off the debt for her apartment. The film went into production in Late July and finished filming in late August 1940. Release The Monster and the Girl was distributed theatrically by Paramount Pictures on February 28, 1941. After its release, the Milwaukee Film Commission withdrew the film from theaters on the grounds that it was a \\"white slavery\\" film. The ban also stated that it showcased juries as being under gangster control which would make it impossible impossible for justice to be carried out. The Monster and the Girl is set for release on blu ray by Scream Factory on June 16, 2020 as the fifth volume in their Universal Horror Collection, along with Captive Wild Woman, Jungle Woman and Jungle Captive. Reception Blair Davis, author of Recovering 1940s Horror Cinema described the reception of the film as positive. A review in The Chicago Tribune calling it \\"weird and skeery no end\\" but full of \\"snappy dialog The review added that Ellen Drew \\"depicts stark terror so realistically that I feel she is scheduled to slip into the boot of Fay Wray.\\" Variety called the film \\"a chiller-diller that will send fans of goose-pimply melodrama from the theaters amply satisfied\\" and \\"red meat of the bugaboo ticket buyers.\\" From retrospective reviews, Craig Butler of AllMovie declared the film as \\"definitely one of the strangest pictures ever made.\\" that was still \\"fairly effective and entertaining little \\"B\\" flick -- and not one that gets by just on camp value.\\" Noting that the stories plot points were ridiculous, but \\"has some very interesting points, including a mixture of noir and horror which, while not totally successful, offers some rewards\\" and that \\"the cast is also much better than one usually finds in horror films of this type.\\" References =Sources=   External links  * * Category:1941 films Category:1941 horror films Category:Mad scientist films Category:American monster movies Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Stuart Heisler Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:1940s science fiction horror films ","title":"The Monster and the Girl"},{"id":"9430313","text":"\\"Guigemar\\" is a Breton lai, a type of narrative poem, written by Marie de France during the 12th century. The poem belongs to the collection known as The Lais of Marie de France. Like the other lais in the collection, Guigemar is written in the Anglo-Norman language, a dialect of Old French, in rhyming octosyllabic couplets. \\"Guigemar\\" is one of the works in which the author explicitly gives her name as \\"Marie.\\" In the prologue of this lai, she proclaims two goals for her work: to give rightful praise to people who have earned it, despite what envious rivals may have said; and to present the stories behind certain songs that were well-known at the time. It has been suggested that the prologue to \\"Guigemar\\" predates the overall prologue to the Lais in the Harley 978 manuscript, the only manuscript that records all twelve of Marie's known lais.Laurence Harf-Lancner, notes to \\"Les Lais de Marie de France\\", p. 27, Livre de Poche 1990. Plot Guigemar, son of a loyal vassal to the King of Brittany, is a courageous and wise knight, who despite his many qualities, has been unable to feel romantic love. One day, on a hunting expedition, he mortally wounds a white hind, but he is injured as well. Before dying, the hind speaks to him, leaving a curse that his wound can only be healed by a woman who will suffer for love of him, and he will suffer as much for her. Guigemar wanders through the forest until he finds a river and a lavishly decorated boat with no crew. He boards it and lies down in pain. When he gets back up, he realises that the boat has left port and that he is unable to control where it takes him. The boat takes him to a land where the lord has imprisoned his lady out of jealousy. The lady is permitted to see only two other people: a maiden who has become her confidante, and an elderly priest. The only part of her prison that is not walled off is a garden, surrounded by the sea. The magical boat carrying Guigemar docks near the garden. The lady and her maiden tend to the knight's wound and shelter him within their gilded cage. Guigemar and the lady fall in love almost immediately, but they are each uncertain if their feelings are mutual. The knight confides his feelings to the maiden, who arranges a secret meeting with her lady. Once the lady is convinced of the sincerity of Guigemar's motives, they consummate their love. Their year and a half of bliss is ended when the lord's chamberlain discovers them together. The lord forces Guigemar to return to his own country. As signs of their fidelity to one another, the lady ties a knot in his shirt that only she can untie without tearing or cutting, and he gives her a belt tied with a knot that only he can untie. Guigemar is hailed as a hero in his own country, but he can only think of his distant love. Meanwhile, the lord imprisons his lady within a marble tower. After two years of captivity, she has become very depressed out of her longing for Guigemar. She manages to escape the tower and considers drowning herself in the nearby sea. She then spots the same mysterious ship that had carried Guigemar long ago, and she decides to board it. The ship brings her to Brittany, where she is taken captive by the Lord M√©riaduc. He falls madly in love with her and tries to rape her, but the knot in the belt prevents his attempt. Later on, Lord M√©riaduc holds a jousting tournament, which Guigemar attends. Knowing that Guigemar wears a shirt with a knot that only his true love can untie, and that the lady wears a belt that only her true love can untie, Lord M√©riaduc summons her to meet Guigemar, suspecting the two are connected. Guigemar does not recognize the lady; therefore, to test her identity, he allows her to try to untie the knotted shirt that she had given him years ago. Although she succeeds, Guigemar still refuses to accept her identity until she reveals the knotted belt. She then tells him of her sorrowful journey. M√©riaduc attempts to keep the lady under his control, but Guigemar lays siege to his lands. Many people die on both sides of the conflict, but finally Guigemar prevails.

This work by the Roman poet Ovid counsels readers how to avoid being swept away by love.

The station joined the network in March 2002, following the opening of the extension from Pelaw to South Hylton. The current station is located about north of the former Pallion station. The station opened in June 1853, as part of the Penshaw branch of the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway. Following the Beeching Axe, the line was closed, with the station being closed to passengers in May 1964, along with Hylton, and to goods in July 1965. At nearby Millfield, passenger service was withdrawn in May 1955, with goods facilities remaining until the late 1970s. Between Pallion and Millfield, it was necessary for the Tyne and Wear Metro route to deviate from the original alignment, owing to the construction of a road.

History The conference was started in 1963. In 2004, James W. Moseley retired as the NUFOC's Permanent Chairman and Lisa Davis became the Executive Director. In 2004, Davis decided to keep NUFOC in Hollywood. She believes that expanding contacts within the entertainment community will greatly assist in raising public awareness of the phenomena. \\"I took over directing the National UFO Conference not for monetary gain, but rather to advance awareness of the phenomena.\\" Davis has had a fascination with astronomy since childhood. Her research has covered many different aspects of philosophy, religion, science, medicine, and the paranormal. One of Davis's goals is to bring the UFO/Abduction scenario into the mainstream public awareness in a professional and practical manner. Davis has been very active in ufology since 1997. She started The Foundation For Abductee Research and Support in 2000 where she created an online presence of support and information for those unwillingly involved in the abduction phenomenon. In 2003 Davis attended The National UFO Conference in Los Angeles and quickly became active in assisting Moseley in the planning of the 2004 conference.

In this aircraft, Kingsford Smith made the first eastward trans-Pacific flight from Australia to the United States, in October and November of 1934. Delivery In April 1934, Kingsford Smith ordered an aircraft from Lockheed for use in the MacRobertson Air Race in October of that year. The aircraft was rebuilt from a Lockheed Sirius originally built for George R. Hutchinson in 1930.VH-USB \\"Lady Southern Cross\\" (Part 1) The aircraft was delivered by ship to Sydney, Australia in July 1934, bearing Kingsford Smith's requested blue livery and the name 'ANZAC'. However, before it could be flown in Australia, the Government objected to the commercial use of ANZAC (the use of which remains restricted in Australian law todayDept of Veteran Affairs: Acceptable uses of \\"ANZAC\\" ), and Kingsford Smith was forced to remove it.VH-USB \\"Lady Southern Cross\\" (Part 2) After finally getting the machine, now named Lady Southern Cross, out of Customs, Kingsford Smith and copilot Patrick Gordon Taylor set several speed records flying between Australian cities as they prepared to fly to England for the race. With all paperwork finally complete, they began the flight to England on 29 September 1934, with a first leg planned to end in Darwin. However, dust storms and stress failure of the engine cowling turned them back to Sydney, and they were forced to withdraw from the race.VH-USB \\"Lady Southern Cross\\" (Part 3) The race was subsequently won, and a new speed record set, by a British de Havilland DH.88 racing aircraft. Trans-Pacific flight Now in financial trouble, and with the Lady Southern Cross facing withdrawal of its airworthiness certificate if it did not leave Australia, Kingsford Smith decided to attempt the first eastward crossing of the Pacific Ocean by aircraft, from Australia to the United States. Kingsford Smith and Taylor departed Archerfield Airport on 21 October 1934, for the reverse journey from that the Southern Cross had made in 1928; Brisbane-Fiji-Hawaii-Oakland. Bad weather in Fiji and the need for extensive repairs to the fuel and oil systems in Hawaii meant the flight took considerably longer than the 1928 flight - 15 days vs 9 - despite the Altair being a much faster aircraft than the Fokker. After arriving safely in Oakland on 4 November 1934, the Lady Southern Cross was left in the care of Lockheed at Burbank, California for repair, overhaul and storage. England-Australia With the Lady Southern Cross substantially repaired and rebuilt in Burbank, Kingsford Smith flew cross-country to New York in September 1935 and had the Lady Southern Cross put on a ship to England. After obtaining a British airworthiness certificate, and having been turned back once by a hailstorm over Italy, Kingsford Smith and co-pilot Tommy Pethybridge left Croydon Airport in London on 6 November 1935 in an attempt to break the England to Australia speed record set during the MacRobertson Air Race.VH-USB \\"Lady Southern Cross\\" (Part 4) Disappearance Kingsford Smith and Pethybridge were flying the Lady Southern Cross overnight from Allahabad, India, to Singapore (c.2200 mi.), while attempting to break the England- Australia speed record, when they disappeared over the Andaman Sea in the early hours of 8 November 1935. Aviator C.J. Melrose claimed to have seen the Lady Southern Cross fighting a storm 150 miles from shore and 200 feet over the sea with fire coming from its exhaust. Eighteen months later, Burmese fishermen found an undercarriage leg and wheel (with its tyre still inflated) which had been washed ashore at Aye Island in the Gulf of Martaban, off the southeast coastline of Burma, some south of Mottama (formerly known as Martaban). Lockheed confirmed the undercarriage leg to be from the Lady Southern Cross. Botanists who examined the weeds clinging to the undercarriage leg estimated that the aircraft itself lies not far from the island at a depth of approximately .By Aye TIME 1938-06-06 The undercarriage leg is now on public display at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia. In 2009 a Sydney film crew claimed they were 100% certain they found the Lady Southern Cross. The location of the claimed find was widely mis-reported as \\"in the Bay of Bengal\\" - the 2009 search was at the same location where the landing gear had been found in 1937, at Aye Island, in the Andaman Sea. However, this claim was treated with scepticism by well-known businessman and pilot, Dick Smith, while Kingsford Smith's biographer, Ian Mackersey, described it as \\"complete nonsense\\".

Married 1853 to Baroness Hedvig Lewenhaupt, with whom he had ten children. Life Axel Adlercreutz was born in Skara in present-day V√§stra G√∂taland County, the son of Lieutenant General Gustaf Magnus Adlercreutz and Margareta Elisabeth Charlotta von Arbin. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree at Uppsala 1845 and then made a typical and successful career in the civil service: clerk at the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency and at the Bureau for Justice Affairs (Justitierevisionen), then a notary at the Svea Court of Appeal, Deputy District Judge (vice h√§radsh√∂vding) 1848, Public Prosecutor (fiskal) 1850, Assessor 1853 and Justice of the Supreme Court of Sweden 1860, finally becoming President of G√∂ta Court of Appeal 1868. Adlercreutz barely had time to take up his office before King Charles XV appointed him Minister of Civil Affairs in the Cabinet of Louis De Geer, despite the fact that Adlercreutz had opposed the abolition of the Parliament of the Estates, a minor revolution that had been the work of De Geer. One explanation for the King's choice was a desire to placate a Parliament that had adopted a cool attitude toward the Government after the Representation Reform Act of 1865-66. The Second Chamber was dominated by fiscally conservative farmers who adopted cuts in the Government's budget proposal, backed up by the First Chamber where resentment toward the Representation Reform still lingered. When the criticism did not abate, De Geer also lost the support of the King and resigned. As the strongest figure in the Privy Council, Adlercreutz now became Prime Minister for Justice. The King now intervened more openly with Government affairs, which undermined the position of the Privy Council. Charles announced in his Throne Speech that he intended to summon an extraordinary Parliament in order to solve the issue of defense policy. Not even all members of the Council had been notified in advance. When, at this extraordinary Parliament, the Government lost the vote on defense policy, all members of the Privy Council requested to be relieved of their office. While the King attempted to compose a new government, Minister of Foreign Affairs Carl Wachtmeister suffered a stroke in the street and fell dead to the ground. Except a frail health, he had been upset and worried during the crisis of government. 23 days after the resignation applications, the Posttidningen declared that since efforts to form a new Privy Council had failed to achieve their intended objective, the current members of the Privy Council had offered to remain in their offices, upon the King's request. Thus Adlercreutz oversaw the change on the throne after Charles XV, who died in 1872 after some time of disease at the age of 46, to the King's brother, Oscar II. In 1873, the issue of defense policy was solved by a compromise engineered by De Geer in his capacity as Chairman of the Parliament Defense Committee. Nevertheless, conflict arose the following year over a question concerning the organization of the Army, over which Adlercreutz to some surprise demanded a vote of confidence and lost. Upon his resignation he was appointed Governor of Malm√∂hus County. In that district, he was returned to the bicameral Parliament of 1877, after having been absent since the abolition of the Parliament of the Estates, wherein he had belonged to the Estate of the Nobility. After his resignation he became an outspoken critic of the policy of the De Geer Cabinet; among other issues he opposed the abolition of the duty of conveyance which the major part of farmers owed the King. He tabled motions on legislation against lotteries. Axel Adlercreutz was of a hot-tempered and courageous nature. He never hesitated to give as good as he got on the floor of Parliament. Count Henning Hamilton, used to being treated with great deference, was nonplussed when Adlercreutz rebuked him for his gibes. When De Geer lamented the coarse tone of the debate, Adlercreutz replied that it was only the final powerless twitches of the defeated. With his undaunted spirit and na√Øvete, he also passed quite unscathed through Parliament despite all attempts to bring him down. He was small and brave as a weasel, Carl Wadenstierna, his colleague in Parliament, said of him. Axel Adlercreutz died May 20, 1880 in Stockholm, at the age of 59.

He is regarded as being one of the key figures responsible for the worldwide revival of ragtime. Zimmerman is the first pianist to have recorded the complete works of Scott Joplin and in 1987 was awarded the first place prize ‚ÄúChampion Ragtime Performer of the World‚Äù. Zimmerman was technical advisor for the film Scott Joplin. He is a founder of the \\"Maple Leaf Club\\", and is the editor of its publication, \\"The Rag Times\\". Zimmerman is also a professional magician. He has contributed many signature illusions to the field of magic and has acted as consultant for such magicians as David Copperfield. Life and career Zimmerman was trained as a child in classical music, but quickly abandoned his studies to pursue his love for ragtime when his magic teacher played a honky-tonk record by \\"one of the great American composers, Scott Joplin.\\" In 1956 he enrolled at Stanford University where he received degrees in civil and mechanical engineering. Zimmerman later went on to design games for Mattel, Inc. As a freshman, a classmate introduced him to the rags of Scott Joplin. But it wasn‚Äôt until 1973, when the movie The Sting began the revival of ragtime with a musical score by Marvin Hamlisch, which adapted the original rags of Scott Joplin, that Zimmerman turned his attention to performing and recording. In 1974, he released the five-LP collection ‚Äò‚ÄôScott Joplin: His Complete Works‚Äô‚Äô on the Murray Hill Records label. In 1967 Zimmerman, along with Dave Bourne, Albert Huerta, Chuck McClure, and Bill Mitchell, founded the ‚Äò‚ÄôMaple Leaf Club‚Äô‚Äô, for which he edited its newsletter, \\"The Rag Times\\". In 1998 the ‚Äò‚ÄôMaple Leaf Club‚Äô‚Äô merged with the ‚Äò‚ÄôRose Leaf Club‚Äô‚Äô. As a producer, Zimmerman created the ragtime concert series ‚Äò‚ÄôWhere It Was!‚Äô‚Äô in Los Angeles. The venue featured ragtime stars from both the past and present, including such legends as pianist and composer Eubie Blake, who once said of Zimmerman: \\"[Dick] is a real ragtime pianist, and he knows more about its history than I do!\\" Zimmerman has appeared in concert and at music festivals throughout the United States and Canada. He has appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, PBS, BBC-TV, BBC World Service Radio, as well as the Canadian Broadcasting Co. and Australia Broadcasting. He has performed in concert at the Montreal International Jazz Festival in Canada and the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. He has also served as long-time musical director of the \\"Scott Joplin Ragtime Festival in Sedalia, Missouri\\". He was the recipient of the Scott Joplin Foundation Achievement Award in 1991. Today, Zimmerman runs \\"American Ragtime Co.\\", recording and publishing ragtime classics and the works of early 20th century blues composers. Magic career Zimmerman is known for originating many illusions in the field of magic. He was a member of the Academy of Magical Arts Board, located at The Magic Castle in Los Angeles, California, and also the Director of AMA's annual \\"It's Magic\\" show.

It was renamed in 1785 the Royal Philippine Company (). History The old buildings of the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas in La Guaira Stock certificate of the Guipuzcoana Company (Madrid, 10 December 1729 = Foundation = The Company was founded by a group of wealthy Basques from the province of Gipuzkoa in 1728. The specific aim of the Basque Company, acting almost autonomously with tasks of military nature at their own command and expense, was to break the de facto Dutch monopoly on the cocoa trade in the Captaincy General of Venezuela. It was initially based in San Sebasti√°n and received its royal decree on September 25, 1728, by Philip V of Spain.Kurlansky, M. A Basque History of the World. Vintage, London, 2000. Its creation was part of the larger Bourbon Reforms to control unlicensed trading, especially in tobacco, which existed along the Orinoco River and mostly benefited the foreign, Dutch, English, and French traders, who were preferred by the landholders of Canary Islander descent as trade partners. The Venezuelan possessions and their managerial wealthy Creole class thus operated detached from the metropolis. The Venezuelan colonial system turned into an embarrassment and hardly productive for the Spanish-Castilian Crown in terms of revenue. Between 1700 and 1728 only five vessels set sail from Spain to Venezuela.Douglass, William A. Bilbao, J. 2005, p.87 The establishment of the Company resulted from negotiations engaged with the Basque governments in the aftermath of the bloody military campaign ordered by Philip V of Spain over the western Basque districts. The government of Gipuzkoa in particular came up with a proposal for the re-establishment of commerce with Venezuela that would suit the Basque interests and those of the Spanish king alike. The plan was approved, with the Basques getting total exclusivity on that commerce. The Guipuzcoana Company was the only body entitled to sell European goods in Venezuela (or Caracas) Province and to export Venezuelan agricultural products to Spain. Goods imported on to other Spanish territories would incur no custom duties on the Ebro river according to the treaty signed with the Spanish king Philip V, and the Company was able to trade freely throughout Europe. The Company would in turn export iron commodities to Venezuela. The Guipuzcoana Company became the first shares based company in Spain, participated by Basque shareholders and the king of Spain. Since 1743, the Company got permission to charter vessels under the French flag, which could trade directly with Venezuela.Douglass, William A. Bilbao, J. 2005, p.90 The main beneficiaries of that decision were no doubt the coast of the Basque province of Labourd, and Bayonne. =Operations and effects in Venezuela= The Company's seat in Cagua It began operating in 1730--four ships departed from San Sebasti√°n (Donostia) taking on board a crew of 561 and 40-50 cannons. The vessels were hailed with frontal hostility by the Venezuelan Creoles, a refusal to sell cocoa to the Company, and an uprising against the newcomers and the local Spanish garrison, until control was re-established. The Basques started to settle down in Venezuelan territory on wealthy haciendas that boosted plantations and agricultural production. However, the move was resented by other established Creoles based on the fact that it brought down prices to be sold to the Company., p. 90 The Basques established settlements, built dock facilities, and fortifications. The term un gran cacao became a nickname for a member of the new powerful class (and to this day the term is used jocularly in Venezuela for a VIP). It did not help smaller farmers who continued to participate in illegal trading. The Company was instrumental in the development of large-scale cocoa production along the valleys of the coast and encouraged the production of such crops as tobacco, indigo, cotton and coffee. Venezuela's chocolate revolution By Greg Morsbach news.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved Dev 14, 2012 In addition, the company promoted the exploration and settlement of frontier areas, most famously under the border expedition of 1750-1761 headed by a company agent, Jos√© de Iturriaga y Aguirre, which resulted in new settlements in the Guayana region. The Company's control of the major ports of La Guaira and Puerto Cabello meant that it effectively monopolized the legal trade of the other Venezuelan provinces. In addition, the Company's strict control of much needed manufactured imports naturally created a lot of resentment in a region which depended on these. Several rebellions took place against the Company and the Basques in which ethnic confrontation came to a head in 1749--a variety of Creole population supported by the Dutch and English vs the powerful Basques supported by the Spanish Crown.Douglass, William A. Bilbao, J. 2005, p.92 The rebellion was led by Juan Francisco de Le√≥n, a Canary Islander just replaced as Corporal of War (1749), but the Spanish Crown could not shrink from protecting its own interests by supporting the Company, and quelling the uprising that very year. =Effects in Gipuzkoa= Apart from breaking the Dutch monopoly and creating significant wealth in the Basque port cities, the Company provided a fast track to job positions for many Basques. The Company's activity kept operative the gradually declining Basque forges in the face of growing competition from English industry, and fed indirectly the arms factories of Soraluze (Placencia de las Armas) and Tolosa. Another outcome was the foundation in Bergara of the Royal Basque Society of Friends of the Country by a group under the leadership of Xavier Mar√≠a de Munibe e Idi√°quez, Count of Pe√±aflorida, in 1765. Its model expanded to the Spanish heartland prompting the establishment of the \\"Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s\\"--a type of Enlightenment think tank. =Later years= Soraluze (Placencia de las Armas), a key arms manufacturer for the Company in Gipuzkoa Share of the Real Compa√±ia de Filipinas (Royal Philippine Company), issued 15. July 1785 While Basque involvement increased after 1749, the Spanish Crown dealt a critical blow to the Basques when it diffused the Basque grip over the Company by transferring its headquarters to Madrid, a move contested by Gipuzkoa, and imposing the requirement to include a Spaniard in a board of directors of three (1751).Douglass, William A. Bilbao, J. 2005, p.93 Facing increasing hostility from English war vessels and weakened by the liberalization of commerce with Venezuela (1776), the Company's monopoly came to an end. The crown no longer saw the need for a monopolizing company to control and grow the economy, since by that time the Venezuelan economy had matured and been tightly linked with the markets of Spain and New Spain, which consumed most of its cocoa. The Spanish crown terminated the company's charter in 1784. A key effect of the Caracas Company, despite its eventual commercial failure, was that it guaranteed the place of Caracas in the Captaincy-General.Gary M. Miller, \\"Caracas Company\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, 1996, vol. 1, p. 548. When the crown established a high court (Real Audiencia) in the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1786, it was sited in Caracas.In√©s Quintero, \\"Audiencia of Caracas\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, 1996, vol. 1, p. 547. The owners of the Guipuzcoana Company transformed it into the Royal Philippine Company (1785). Instead a consulado de mercaderes (a merchants' guild) was established in Caracas in 1793. One of the most active proponents of the move was Fran√ßois Cabarrus, a prominent company stockholder hailing from a merchant family in Bayonne (Labourd), increasingly involved in Spanish finances and politics.

Grimm belonged to the second generation of Russian neo-Byzantine architects and was the author of orthodox cathedrals in Tbilisi, Chersonesos and smaller churches in Russia and Western Europe. Grimm was a long-term professor at the Imperial Academy of Arts and chaired its Department of Architecture in 1887-1892. Biography David Grimm was born in a Lutheran family and attended the German Saint Peter's School in Saint Petersburg. He completed the class of Alexander Brullov at the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1841-1848. His graduation honours entitled Grimm to take an Academy-sponsored study tour of Italy and France, but it was cancelled due to the revolutions of 1848 in Europe. Rather than waiting until the end of hostilities, Grimm opted for a study tour of the Caucasus (1849‚Äì1850) that exposed him to the wealth of vernacular Georgian and Armenian architecture. In 1852‚Äì1855 Grimm travelled to Asia Minor, Italy and Greece, studying the Byzantine relics. These studies were summarized in Grimm's 12-volume Monuments of Byzantine architecture in Georgia and Armenia (1859‚Äì1856) and subsequent works. Grimm became a professor of the Institute of Civil Engineers in 1856 and at the Academy in 1859. In 1858 empress Maria Alexandrovna commissioned Grimm to design the cathedral in Chersonesos, on the site of a Greek church where Vladimir I of Kiev was baptized in 988. Construction of the cathedral commenced before the Crimean War to the design by Konstantin Thon; after the war, his design was discarded and work began from scratch. Maria's choice was influenced by another Byzantine scholar, Grigory Gagarin. Grimm's design was approved in June 1859 and displayed to the public the next year. Unlike contemporary Byzantine architects, Grimm based his draft on Georgian legacy, employing polygonal surfaces instead of Byzantine cylinders and domes. Construction started in 1861 and, despite royal sponsorship, proceeded very slowly: the structure was completed in 1876, and the interiors in 1897. The Chersonesus Cathedral remained a sole example of the Georgian line in Byzantine revival until it reappeared shortly before World War I. The other commission of the Romanovs, a Byzantine chapel in Nice, commemorating the late Nicholas Alexandrovich, was completed in less than two years, 1866‚Äì1868). In the next twenty years Grimm designed numerous Orthodox \\"embassy churches\\", including the Russian Church, Geneva, the Alexander Nevsky Church, Copenhagen and the Church of Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem; according to the state preference, they were executed in the Russian Revival theme of 17th century Yaroslavl architecture. In 1865 Grimm and Robert Gedike jointly took part in the contest to design a new cathedral in Tbilisi but lost to Victor Schroeter and Alexander Huhn. Schroeter-Huhn proposal, if executed, would have been the largest Neo-Byzantine structure of its time. The client - viceroy of the Caucasus Mikhail Nikolayevich - dismissed the Schroeter-Huhn proposal as too expensive; he supported the Grimm-Gedike draft but instructed the architects to decrease its size to cut costs. The building that was completed in 1871-1897 followed the original Russian scheme of a single dome with four symmetrical apses created by Roman Kuzmin in 1861, yet Grimm changed his proportions to create a tall, vertical silhouette. Grimm's draft, publicised in the 1860s, paved the road to numerous variations of the same single-dome layout and was perfected by Vasily Kosyakov in the 1880s. Grimm's last design, the burial vault of Grand Dukes in Peter and Paul Fortress, remained on paper: after Grimm's death, the project was taken over by Antony Tomischko, who also died soon, and the Vault was redesigned and completed by Leon Benois in Baroque style.

Marchionne was the chairman of CNH Industrial, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the chairman and CEO of FCA US LLC, the chairman and CEO of Ferrari, and the chairman of Maserati. He was the chairman of Swiss-based SGS and vice chairman of UBS from 2008 to 2010, as well as the chairman of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association for 2012 (first elected in January 2006). He was a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the chairman of the Italian branch of the Council for the United States and Italy. Noted for his keen observations of the automotive industry, Marchionne's insights ranged from frank criticism of his company's own products to a highly regarded 2015 presentation titled Confessions of a Capital Junkie, extolling the benefits of industry consolidation. Marchionne was widely recognized for turning around Fiat Group to become one of the fastest growing companies in the auto industry, in less than two years. In 2009, he was instrumental in Fiat Group forming a strategic alliance with the ailing US automaker Chrysler, with the support of the U.S. and Canadian governments and trade unions. Less than two years later, following its emergence from Chapter 11, Chrysler returned to profitability, repaying all government loans. In 2014, Fiat and Chrysler merged into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, now the seventh- largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Following complications from surgery, Marchionne resigned from all of his positions in July 2018 and died a few days later. The American business channel CNBC described Marchionne as a \\"legend of automotive industry\\", while the British newspaper Financial Times considered him as having been \\"one of the boldest business leaders of his generation\\". Early life Marchionne was born in Chieti, Abruzzo, Italy, the son of Concezio Marchionne, from Cugnoli (Abruzzo), and Maria Zuccon from Carnizza (today Krnica, Croatia) near Pula in Istria. His father served as a Carabiniere in Istria, where he met his future wife. Marchionne's grandfather, Giacomo Zuccon, was killed in September 1943 by Yugoslav Partisans near Barban in Istria, while his uncle Giuseppe Zuccon was killed by the Nazis the same year. In 1945, when the region was occupied by the Yugoslav army, Marchionne's parents moved to Chieti in Abruzzo, where Sergio was born. At 13, Marchionne emigrated with his family to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where they had relatives. Carrying dual Canadian and Italian citizenship, he spoke fluent English, French and Italian. Marchionne was a Canadian certified general accountant (FCGA), barrister, and a fellow of the Certified General Accountants of Ontario. Marchionne attended St. Michael's College School, before completing his undergraduate studies in philosophy at the University of Toronto and earning a bachelor of commerce degree (1979) and an MBA (1985) from the University of Windsor as well as a law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School of York University (1983). He received an honorary doctorate from Walsh College (2013). Career Sergio Marchionne in 2006 From 1983 to 1985, he worked as an accountant and tax specialist for Deloitte & Touche in Canada. From 1985 to 1988, he was Group Controller and then Director of Corporate Development at the Lawson Mardon Group in Toronto. In 1989, he moved to Glenex Industries where he worked for two years as Executive Vice President. From 1990 to 1992, he was Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer at Acklands Ltd. Between 1992 and 1994, he served as Vice President of Legal and Corporate Development and Chief Financial Officer of the Lawson Group, which was acquired by Alusuisse Lonza (Algroup) in 1994. From 1994 to 2000, he worked at Algroup (Alusuisse Lonza Group Limited) based in Zurich, where he became Chief Executive Officer in 1997. He then took the helm of the Lonza Group in Basel, after its spin-off from Algroup, serving first as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (2000‚Äì2001) and then as Chairman (2002). In February 2002, he became Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of SGS S.A. of Geneva where, in March 2006, he was appointed Chairman. Marchionne was elected as an independent member of the Board of Directors of Fiat S.p.A. in May 2003, until being appointed CEO in 2004. =Chrysler= Chrysler Group CEO Sergio Marchionne (left-right), Congressman alt= In June 2009, when Chrysler emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Fiat Group received a 20% stake in Chrysler Group LLC and Marchionne was appointed CEO, replacing CEO Robert Nardelli. In February 2011 Marchionne sparked widespread controversy in the U.S. when he remarked at the J.D. Power & Associates International Automotive Roundtable that Chrysler's bail-out loans from the U.S. government carried \\"shyster rates\\". > Marchionne immediately issued a public apology, stating \\"I regret the remark > and consider it inappropriate\\" and going on to explain that \\"As the only > parties willing to underwrite the risk associated with Chrysler‚Äôs recovery > plan, the two governments [U.S. and Canadian] levied interest rates that, > although appropriate at the time, are above current market conditions.\\" In July 2011, following the purchase of the ownership interests held by Canada and the US Treasury, Fiat's stake in Chrysler increased to 53.5% and in September 2011, Marchionne was also elected Chairman of Chrysler. Fiat and Chrysler officially merged under Marchionne's leadership on August 1, 2014. Following the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal, in January 2017, the EPA also accused Fiat Chrysler of illegally installing software that allowed excess diesel emissions to go undetected. Marchionne denied any wrongdoing. Therein he was critical of the EPA and rejected comparisons between Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen. Death Marchionne last appeared in public on June 26, 2018, in Rome, when he presented a Jeep to the Carabinieri, Italy's military police.'FCA paints grim picture of Marchionne's health,' Autonews, July 21, 2018. FCA subsequently announced Marchionne had taken medical leave for shoulder surgery at the University Hospital of Z√ºrich in Switzerland -- adding on the day of surgery that he would not return due to post-surgical complications. After further serious complications, on July 21, 2018, Marchionne resigned from all his positions and was replaced at FCA, Ferrari, SGS and CNH. He died on July 25, 2018, at age 66, most likely from complications related to underlying cancer. Some reports claimed he had suffered from an invasive shoulder cancer. According to the University Hospital of Z√ºrich, Marchionne had been treated for a \\"serious illness\\" for over a year before his death, which was also noted by his partner's father Pier Luigi Battezzato. He had also quit smoking since his treatment started. FCA did not have knowledge of his health condition until just weeks before his death.https://europe.autonews.com/article/20180726/COPY/307279999/marchionne- knew-of-serious-illness-for-a-yearhttps://www.autonews.com/executives/new- book-details-final-days-and-legacy-sergio-marchionne He was survived by his partner Manuela Battezzato, his two adult sons, Alessio and Tyler, and his former wife Orlandina. Public image Marchionne wearing his classic black woolen sweater Marchionne earned a reputation for an outspoken and often blunt approach. In a 2009 Forbes interview, Massimo Vecchio, an analyst with Mediobanca, commented on the contrast and Marchionne's controversial management style: Despite the buttoned-down business world in which he worked, Marchionne disliked having to think about his wardrobe, and became known for wearing black sweaters and jeans -- keeping a supply of both in each of his residences. On June 1, 2018, Marchionne wore a necktie to celebrate the FCA debt repayment. Reporters noted that he had not been seen wearing a tie since 2007. He was a chain-smoker until a year before his death. Legacy The Istituto Sergio Marchionne high school was opened in Amatrice on 6 November 2019 by John Elkann, CEO of Ferrari. It was rebuilt after the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake, financed largely by the sale of the 500th La Ferrari.Amatrice school named in honor of Sergio Marchionne, ferrari.com, last accessed on 10 January 2020.

The symporter works in the plasma membrane and molecules are transported across the cell membrane at the same time, and is, therefore, a type of cotransporter. The transporter is called a symporter, because the molecules will travel in the same direction in relation to each other. This is in contrast to the antiport transporter. Typically, the ion(s) will move down the electrochemical gradient, allowing the other molecule(s) to move against the concentration gradient. The movement of the ion(s) across the membrane is facilitated diffusion, and is coupled with the active transport of the molecule(s). Examples Robert K. Crane and his sketch of the sodium-glucose symporter SGLT1 in the intestinal epithelium transports sodium ions (Na+) and glucose across luminal membrane of the epithelial cells so that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This is the basis of oral rehydration therapy. If this symporter did not exist, individual sodium channels and glucose uniporters would not be able to transfer glucose against the concentration gradient and into the bloodstream. Na+/K+/2Cl‚àí symporter in the loop of Henle in the renal tubules of the kidney transports 4 molecules of 3 different types; a sodium ion (Na+), a potassium ion (K+) and two chloride ions (2Cl‚àí). Loop diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix) act on this protein. Marine invertebrates use symporters to transport against strong chemical gradients. Amino acids and sugars are taken up from sea water in the presence of extracellular sodium and is driven by the NA+/K+-ATPase pump. In the roots of plants, the H+/K+ symporters are only one member of a group of several symporters/antiporters that specifically allow only one charged hydrogen ion (more commonly known as a proton) and one charged K+ ion. This group of carriers all contribute to modulate the chemiosmotic potential inside the cell. Initially H+ is pumped into the area outside the root by H+ ATPase. This change in both the pH and electrochemical potential gradient between the inside of the cell and the outside produces a proton motive force, as the protons will want to naturally flow back into the area of low concentration and with a voltage closer to zero from their current situation of being in an area of high concentration of positively charged protons. The reasons for this are twofold. For one, substances in nature have a tendency to move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, as is evident by dropping a drop of food coloring in a glass of water. It does not aggregate, but begins to move from the highly concentrated areas (the colored areas) to the areas of low concentration (clear areas). Second, large groups of predominantly positively charged or negatively charged particles will naturally repel each other. This is demonstrated by attempting to push the two positive poles or two negative poles of a magnet together. Depending on the strength of the magnet, the repulsion may be so strong that it is impossible to push the magnets together unless aided by machinery. Proton motive force does work on the system by bringing ions back towards the epidermis of the root or surface of a root hair along with the protons. From the surface of the soil/root interface, specific carriers, like H+/K+ symporters allow the specific ions to come into the cell and the out the plasmodesmata/symporters/antiporters of the side of the cell facing away from the soil so that the essential element can make its way up the plant to the area it is needed so that it may supply the plant with important nutrients that are vital to the plant's being able to reach maturity.

The websites are used to communicate with guests of their wedding and inform them of location, date, time, and a gift registry. Each wedding website is different, and a couple has to pick what is best for them. The websites can be free but may sometimes cost a fee. However, most couples find that the website fee is less costly than hiring a wedding planner, as wedding planners can cost as much as 15% of the total wedding cost. Criticism of wedding websites include that invitations from websites are too informal for the occasion. Purpose Personal wedding websites are used for a variety of purposes including communication with guests, sharing wedding photos and videos with those who were unable to attend, providing maps, hotel and destination information, bridal party and couple biographies, and profiling vendors. Increasingly the sites are being used as tools for wedding planning. Many do-it-yourself sites offer features like online RSVP, blogs, registry management, and budget management tools to aid couples through the wedding organizing process. Wedding websites offer a way for couples to showcase their personality and set the tone for what their wedding will be like. As wedding couples see the importance of wedding websites, there has been a growth in worldwide wedding website suppliers. Led by many of the large United States based operators, wedding website suppliers now operate in many worldwide locations, many creating specific functionality and tools for their own national identities, customs and faiths. Each website offers different templates, services, and some charge a fee to use them and experts recommend comparing websites before choosing one. Depending on the specific site, some will host the personal \\"wedpage\\" for six months, 12 months, or forever. The cost is strongly correlated between factors such as domain name, advertisements appearing on the page, number of pages available, and different amounts/types of media available. Communication Through the use of the internet information about any wedding has become available to anyone with a smart phone or a computer. This is an improvement from standard wedding invitations which only allow for limited information about the ceremony and reception. With the ability to view the website, a guest has the option to RSVP, choose their meal, see surrounding attractions in the area, view the accommodations to reserve a hotel room, and view the bridal party list. A website can also allow a couple to post additional engagement photos, share stories of how they met and got engaged, include links to their online wedding registries, and also receive online guestbook comments. Though the standard mailed invitation is a carried out tradition, websites allow for a more interactive way to communicate the information. Comparing and contrasting the price of wedding planner with price of website While personal wedding websites are mostly to give the guests information on the wedding such as the date, time and location, the websites can also include things such as blogs and planning bibliographies in which viewers of the wedding website can interact with the bride. Weddings brought to life from personal wedding websites may lack in creativity and originality as many of them suggest traditional weddings and encourage brides to look at celebrity weddings for inspiration. Most brides see personal wedding website, particularly free ones, as a more cost-efficient way of planning and informing friends and family about their wedding, however, some of these website promote expensive wedding products and ideas as opposed to less expensive and more realistic items. With free or fee-based websites, the user receives their own domain name for the website. It is also important to note that wedding planners are for the purpose of helping the bride while the wedding website caters more for the guests. Most wedding websites are used for both planning purposes and personal pages. According to White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture, wedding planners typically consist of 15% of the wedding's total cost. Depending on what percent the planner takes, they usually make between $2,880 and $4,320 for every wedding they plan. Wedding planners can charge an hourly wage, ranging from $40-$100, depending on which part of the country they conduct their services in. The rate also depends on how much experience the wedding planner has had; those with more experience are paid more than those just starting out. Criticism of wedding websites Criticism of wedding websites includes the process of sending out invitations via email rather than by mail. In a recent survey, 37% of voters said that evites should \\"never\\" be sent out, while 49% said it \\"depended on the wedding,\\" and 14% said \\"anytime.\\" Most wedding planning books suggest to the brides ways to find cheaper wedding invitations and typically do not suggest evites. However, evites are a money-saving and environmentally friendly way of sending invitations. Money is not spent on the actual paper and postage and paper is not used. Website etiquette can become complicated when it comes to what information can be put on the personal site. Putting a gift registry on the website is looked down upon by some experts. Couples can put the registry on the websites but let the guests find it themselves. Couples are not to put events that not all guests are invited to on the website, such as the engagement party or wedding shower.

The Ma family began trading in bucket chicken in Nanjing, in today's Jiangsu Province, after the Song dynasty moved to the south. In 1855, Ma Youren, a descendant of the original Mr Ma moved back to his ancestral home in the village of Laodong, Kaifeng, bringing with him a bucket of the traditional sauce. There, Ma Youren established the \\"Ma Yuxing Roast Chicken Shop\\" in 1864, specialising in bucket chicken. In 1954, a branch store was established in Zhengzhou when that city became the capital of Henan province. In February 2007, Ma Yu Ching's bucket chicken was named as an intangible cultural heritage of Henan Province.

This principle is summarised in the scheme below. center  Generations, Structure, and Synthesis  = First-generation = The first-generation of Glycoazodyes was first reported in 2007. These Glycoazodyes use a diester linker, specifically a succinyl bridge. An ester group bonds the sugar to an n-alkane spacer, and the spacer bonds to the dye through another ester group.  Synthesis  First-generation Glycoazodyes are synthesized using glucose, galactose or lactose as the sugar group. The point of esterification is controlled by selectively protecting alcohol groups on the sugar, or by choosing an azo dye with a different alcohol group position. Either the dye or the sugar group can be succinylated by reacting a free alcohol group with succinic anhydride. The resulting hemisuccinate then reacts with a free alcohol group on either the dye or the sugar. The condensation product is then deprotected. = Second-generation = The second-generation of Glycoazodyes was first reported in 2008. These Glycoazodyes use an etherel linker. An ether group bonds the sugar and the dye to an n-alkane spacer, and the spacer bonds to the dye through another ether group. Like first-generation Glycoazodyes, second-generation Glycoazodyes use glucose, galactose or lactose as the sugar group.  Synthesis  Like first-generation Glycoazodyes, second-generation Glycoazodyes are synthesized using a glucose, galactose, or lactose sugar group. The point of the ether bond is controlled by selectively protecting alcohol groups on the sugar, or by choosing an azo dye with a different alcohol group position. An unprotected alcohol group of either the sugar or the dye is reacted with an n-carbon, terminal dibromoalkane in a solution of potassium hydroxide and 18-crown-6 ether, using non-anhydrous tetrahydrofuran as the solvent. The potassium hydroxide is used to produce an alkoxide ion from the alcohol while the 18-crown-6 ether acts as a phase-transfer agent. The reaction proceeds through a classic SN-2 nucleophilic substitution. A terminal Bromo group is eliminated, and a bond is formed between the oxygen of the alcohol and the carbon of the alkane. An ether is produced between the n-carbon linker and the sugar or the dye. At this stage, the terminal Bromo group that remains may react under the same conditions with the free alcohol of a corresponding sugar or dye. The condensation product is then deprotected. = Third-generation = The third-generation of Glycoazodyes was first reported in 2015. These Glycoazodyes use an amido-ester linker. An amide group bonds the sugar to an n-alkane spacer, and the spacer is bonded to the dye through an ester group.  Synthesis  Third-generation Glycoazodyes are synthesized using amino sugars such as 6-amino-6-deoxy-D-galactose or 6' amino-6'-deoxylactose. The point of the amide bond is controlled by protecting the alcohol groups on the sugar and allowing the free amine to react. The point of the ester group is controlled by choosing a azo dye with a different alcohol group position. Either the dye or the sugar is reacted with succinic anhydride. This forms an amide group with the sugar or an ester group with the dye. The free carboxylic acid may then react with the alcohol group or amine group on the corresponding dye or sugar. The condensation product is then deprotected.  Properties  A variety of fabrics such as wool, silk, nylon, polyester, polyacrylic, polyacetate, and polyurethane may be dyed with Glycoazodyes under moderate temperatures and pressures in aqueous solutions. First-generation Glycoazodyes dye cotton poorly. However, second-generation Glycoazodyes dye cotton effectively. Wool dyed with Glycoazodyes shows good fastness when exposed to the ISO 105-C06 washing and ISO 105 X12 rubbing tests. Glycoazodyes vary in their water solubility. They may be soluble in cold to warm water and may dissolve after stirring or upon addition. Minor variations in absorption spectra occur when Glycoazodye solutions are prepared, using water, acetone, or methanol solvents. Converting a parent azo dye to a Glycoazodye may produce a small hypsochromic shift in the absorption spectra.  Environmental impact  Several properties may make Glycoazodyes an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional synthetic dyes. The increased hydrophilicity of Glycoazodyes allows for the elimination of surfactants, mordants, and salts, during the dyeing process and permits the aqueous dying of a variety of textiles at moderate temperatures and pressures. The unique structure may also allow for the treatment of textile effluent through biological means. Fusarium oxysporum efficiently decolourizes the first-generation Glycoazodye 4-{N,N-Bis[2-(D-galactopyranos-6-yloxy)ethyl]-amino}azobenzene. Various other Ascomycota fungi show a similar potential to decolourise Glycoazodyes, but to a lesser extent. Detoxification has been measured, using the Daphnia magna acute toxicity test, showing a 92% dye detoxification after 6 days. This detoxification method produces low concentrations of nitrobenzene, aniline, and nitrosobenzene.

Biography  Todorov-Gorunia was born in 1916 in the village Gorna Kremena in Vratsa Province. Little is known about his early life; however, he was known to have been a stonemason for sixteen years. It is also known that he joined the Bulgarian Workers' Party in 1939. That same year he was sentenced to seven and a half years in jail for terrorist activities. While in jail he maintained close relations with Tsolo –örastev and Tsvyatko Anev, later to become conspirators. It is not clear how he got out, but in September 1941 he became the first communist partisan in the Vratsa Province, who fought against the pro-German government of Bulgaria in World War II. After the communist takeover, he held the post of vice-minister of agruculture. = Political career = After voicing criticisms towards Todor Zhivkov's reforms of de-Stalinization in the late 50s he was ostracized for a while, but was then brought back and made a member of Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Toward the end of 1964 and in early 1965, Todorov- Gorunia and Tzolo –örastev (–¶–æ–ª–æ –ö—Ä—ä—Å—Ç–µ–≤) organized group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime led by Todor Zhivkov. Among the officers was the commander of the Sofia garrison general Tzviatko Anev (–¶–≤—è—Ç–∫–æ –ê–Ω–µ–≤). Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country.The Plot of Gorunya (–ó–∞–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—ä—Ç –Ω–∞ –ì–æ—Ä—É–Ω—è) The coup (also known as April Conspiracy) was exposed by the counter-intelligence service and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested. Todorov- Gorunia (probably) committed suicide just before the arrest. Nine of the other participants received relatively mild (for the era) sentences ranging from 8 to 15 years imprisonment, while another 192 got party or administrative punishments. Existence of the plot was kept hidden from the public. Literature * A Handbook of the Communist Security Apparatus in East Central Europe 1944-1989, Warsaw, 2005, .

The station broadcast on 93.0FM in Nelson, 92.0FM in Motueka and Takaka and 94.1FM in Murchison. Fifeshire FM first started as a summer station known as Radio Fifeshire operating for just four weeks during January 1983 and broadcasting on 855AM. A year later Radio Fifeshire returned this time broadcasting for 46 days during December 1983 and January 1984 on 990AM. News on the hour came from Radio Avon in Christchurch. For the next 4 summers Radio Fifeshire returned to the Nelson airwaves still broadcasting on 990AM. At midnight on Thursday 28 January 1988, Fifeshire 93FM became New Zealand's 8th private FM radio station to begin broadcasting when Fifeshire began broadcasting permanently on FM in the Nelson region - rewarding the efforts of Fifeshire founders Kevin Ihaia and Digby Lawley. The first song that was played - as with all the previous AM broadcasts - was the Rolling Stones' \\"Start Me Up\\". To promote the launch to FM, Radio Fifeshire had organised Nelson's biggest outdoor concert. Australian bands Icehouse and Boom Crash Opera along with Nelson-born Sharon O‚ÄôNeill performed in front of a crowd of 9000 people at Trafalgar Park. Fifeshire's signal was extended to Murchison in early 1992 on 94.1FM, and then to Golden Bay later that year first on 98.4FM, which was later adjusted to 92.0FM. Also in 1992 Fifeshire networked with Sounds FM in Blenheim providing a local show in both centres. This network was referred to as \\"Over The Top 93FM\\" - referring to both station's locations at the top of the South Island. This networking ceased in 1993. Also in 1993 a second station was started as Fifeshire Classic 99FM; similar to Solid Gold, this station played music from the 50s, 60s and 70s and broadcast on 98.6FM and later the 990AM frequency was also used for Fireshire Classic. In 1998 Fifeshire FM Ltd was sold to Radio Otago and then in 1999 Radio Otago was sold to RadioWorks. Fifeshire FM then became part of RadioWorks collection of local station known as LocalWorks. When RadioWorks took over the station, Fifeshire Classic 99FM was shut down and replaced with Solid Gold on the 98.6FM frequency and at the same time the 990AM frequency was used for Fifeshire FM. The 990AM frequency was used during the early 2000s for talkback programmes. After falling out with the new owners from Radio Otago, station co-founder Kevin Ihaia left in 1998 and started another Nelson station, The Planet 97FM. In December 2004 Fifeshire FM was rebranded as More FM when RadioWorks rebranded the majority of their local stations as either More FM or The Breeze. The station was a live and local station 24 hours a day however following the rebranding to More FM evenings from 7pm and overnight to 6am is now a network programme based from the More FM studios in Auckland, afternoons from 2pm at weekends are also Auckland based. In 2007 the local breakfast show was also replaced with the Christchurch More FM breakfast show, leaving only the morning show (with Blair Kiddey and later Josh Fogden) local. In 2008 the 990AM frequency was used to broadcast BSport into the Nelson region. In 2010, the Nelson frequency was adjusted from 93.0FM to 92.8FM. This change was done as part of a Government programme to align the spacing of FM frequencies in New Zealand to meet international standards.

Circa 1877. Edwin William Keightley (August 7, 1843 ‚Äì May 4, 1926) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. Keightley was born on a farm near Scott in Lagrange County, Indiana. His parents, Peter L. and Elizabeth (Winter) Keightly, emigrated from Lincolnshire, England; the former in 1831, and the latter in 1828. They settled on the farm in Van Buren township in 1836, and soon after they were married. Keightley attended the local common schools, Lagrange Academy, and Valparaiso Collegiate Institute. He was graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1865 and was admitted to the bar. He commenced practice at White Pigeon, Michigan, several miles northwest of his family home in Scott. While practicing law, he was also editor of the White Pigeon Republican, a staunch advocate of Republican Party views and policy. In 1867, Keightley moved to Constantine, Michigan, and entered into a law partnership with Judge S. C. Coffinberry, which ended in 1869, on amicable terms. He was married on July 14, 1868, to Mary Mitchell, the daughter of Thomas Mitchell, a long-time resident of Constantine, and closely identified with its manufacturing and material interests. Logan Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. In 1872, he was elected prosecuting attorney of St. Joseph County, serving until January 21, 1874 when he was appointed by Michigan Governor John J. Bagley to be judge of the 15th circuit court of Michigan, comprising the counties of St. Joseph and Branch County. He was elected to the position in the spring of 1875. In 1876, he was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 4th congressional district to the 45th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1877 to March 3, 1879. Keightley was appointed by U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes as the Third Auditor of the United States Treasury Department and served from April 30, 1879 to April 30, 1885, when he resigned. He resumed the practice of his profession in Chicago, Illinois. He moved to Constantine, Michigan, in 1899 and engaged in agricultural pursuits until his death there. He was interred in Constantine Cemetery.
