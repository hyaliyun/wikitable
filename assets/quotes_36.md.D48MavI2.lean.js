Fisher, 189 U.S. 86 (1903), popularly known as the Japanese Immigrant Case, is a US Supreme Court case on the US government's power to exclude and deport certain classes of alien immigrants under the Immigration Act of 1891. The Supreme Court held that the courts may not interfere with a pending deportation unless the administrative hearing was unfair. However, deportation procedures are subject to constitutional scrutiny, under the Due Process Clause.Howard L. Bens, \\"The Deportation of Aliens,\\" University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register 68, no. 2 (1920), 111.Alexander Aleinikoff, \\"Federal Regulation of Aliens and the Constitution,\\" The American Journal of International Law 83, no. 4, 864. The case was the first time that the Supreme Court allowed judicial review of a procedural due process claim.Hiroshi Motomura, \\"The Curious Evolution of Immigration Law: Procedural Surrogates for Substantive Constitutional Rights,\\" Columbia Law Review 92, no. 7 (1992), 1637.  Background  The passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricted Chinese immigration to the United States but also provided for the deportation of Chinese immigrants who entered the United States in violation of the exclusion laws.Torrie Hester, \\"Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 12.1 In 1892, Congress passed the Geary Act which significantly expanded deportation under Chinese exclusion by introducing a system of residence certificates for all laborers of Chinese descent.Torrie Hester, \\"Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 12. Laborer who did not have a certificate at a deportation hearing would be deported. The Immigration Act of 1882 allowed for the exclusion and deportation of immigrants if they were immoral, criminal, mentally defective, unable to support themselves.Torrie Hester, \\"Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 13. In 1891, Congress extended the federal government's power to deport immigrants by adding categories of excludable and deportable immigrants to include idiots, the insane, paupers, and polygamists and those likely to become a public charge and those convicted of a felony or some other crimes or suffering from contagious diseases.Torrie Hester, \\"Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 14. In 1903, Congress passed another general immigration act, which added anarchists and political radicals to the list of both excludable and deportable immigrants. General immigration deportations were heard before a Board of Special Inquiry staffed by three immigration officers. Appeals went to a Board of Special Inquiry and then to the Secretary of the department that controlled the Bureau of Immigration.Torrie Hester, \\"Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 15. Case Kaoru Yamataya was a sixteen-year-old girl from Japan when she landed in Seattle on July 11, 1901. Four days after her arrival, immigration authorities arrested and detained Yamataya on the grounds that she had entered the country illegally and was likely to become a public charge.Torrie Hester, \\"Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 23. The 1891 Immigration Act excluded any immigrant who was deemed likely to become a public charge. On July 26, 1901, a Board of Special Inquiry of three immigration officials convened to hear her case and found Yamataya deportable. Yamatya appealed her deportation through the court and eventually, her case was heard by the US Supreme Court. Argument Yamataya's appeal, argued by Harold Preston, used three key arguments: *Since the Immigration Act of 1891 \\"did not explicitly provide for due process,\\" the act was unconstitutional. *The appeals process for deportations went to the Secretary of Labor, whose decision was final and not reviewable in court. *The immigration agents denied Yamataya her Fifth Amendment rights of due process as the evidence against her was \\"garbled, incomplete, and in many respects misleading and untrue;\\" the hearing was conducted in English, which she did not speak, and she was investigated without her having access to a legal counsel or having a chance to show that she was not likely to become a public charge.  Decision  Justice Harlan gave the opinion of the court and dismissed Yamataya's appeal. The Supreme Court upheld the law although it had no explicit provisions for due process. The Court did not discuss whether the exclusion and deportation of a certain class of immigrants violated any constitutional rights. Justice Harlan wrote that an act of Congress \\"must be taken to be constitutional unless the contrary plainly and palpably appears.\\". The Supreme Court also held that the appeals process under the law was constitutional. While the appeals process was not reviewable by the courts, the Court found that the immigration law still provided sufficient trial and appellate tribunals. It agreed with the government's assertion of administrative competency by holding that the investigations and actions of the executive offices in the deportation process were not \\"subject to judicial review.\\"Torrie Hester, \\"Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 24. Additionally, the Supreme Court upheld Yamataya's deportation and ruled that the deportation hearings met Fifth Amendment due process rights, as the executive hearing was found to have been in front of immigration agents and to meet the standard of due process. It was also held that even a hearing that an immigrant cannot understand was not a violation of their Fifth Amendment due process rights. For Yamataya, even if the hearing was conducted in English and so she could not understand the proceedings against her, Harlan wrote that \\"was her misfortune, and constitutes no reason‚Ä¶ for the intervention of the courts by habeas corpus.\\"Yamataya, 189 U.S. at 102. However, the Supreme Court argued that if a person was deported without a hearing, Fifth Amendment due process would be violated and so it provided some ability to go through the courts. Significance While Yamataya was ordered to be deported back to Japan, the case significantly altered the appeals process for deportations in the United States. The ruling in effectively created an appeals process in deportations under general immigration law. While immigrants could not challenge the outcome of deportation hearings in the courts and judicial system, they could challenge the legitimacy of the procedures.Torrie Hester, \\"Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 25. If their procedural due process rights had been violated, immigrants were able to appeal their deportations in the courts. That was a significant shift in deportation appeals process, as individuals had an opportunity to appeal their deportation through the courts, which had been unavailable before the case. For 50 years, the Supreme Court decisions would continue to use a procedural due process requirement but refuse to overturn government decisions in both exclusion and deportation contexts.Hiroshi Motomura, \\"The Curious Evolution of Immigration Law: Procedural Surrogates for Substantive Constitutional Rights,\\" Columbia Law Review 92, no. 7 (1992), 1638. The courts remained reluctant to hear any substantive due process constitutional challenges to both the admission and deportation categories established by Congress.Hiroshi Motomura, \\"The Curious Evolution of Immigration Law: Procedural Surrogates for Substantive Constitutional Rights,\\" Columbia Law Review 92, no. 7 (1992), 1639.

The band toured the United Kingdom and recorded three singles, an EP and three albums. The band are the subject of the road diary \\"Dial M For Merthyr\\" by the Welsh author Rachel Trezise. Since splitting, Scott is now a member of Exit International while Chris played in a band called Accident Music until recently splitting and Gav & Matt have been involved in other projects including the short lived All The Damn Vampires. History =Formation and debut= In 2000, school friends Scott Andrews, Gavin Jessop, Matt Rise, Mike Cloke, and Steven Hopkins decided to form a band, originally known as Opium (not to be confused with the Merthyr-based band of the same name). Mike Cloke then left the band and songs such as an Art of fear and Lacerate/Break were written during this time. After a name change demo was recorded at Frontline Studios, Caerphilly, South Wales which won the band the opportunity to play the UK showcase that is In the City, Manchester. The band's chaotic live shows created a buzz on the UK music scene, and after winning 'best unsigned act' at the 2002 Welsh Music Awards (beating off competition from bands such as Funeral for a Friend and Jarcrew), the band then planned releasing their debut single through Cardiff's indie record label, Cascade. The band then recorded the double A side single featuring the above-mentioned songs at Frontline, Caerphilly with Stuart Richardson (Lostprophets) and at Monnow Valley, Monmouthshire, with record producer Greg Haver. The strictly limited edition single was released later that year. =When Bulls Play God= Signed to Worcester's Lockjaw Records by the end of 2002, the band then recorded the mini-album \\"When Bulls Play God\\" at Waiting Room Studios, Mid Wales. The album was recorded in under two weeks and a relentless UK tour schedule was then booked to promote the release. The album was a month late coming out, and received rave reviews from the rock press including Rocksound, Metal Hammer, and Kerrang! magazine. The band set out on tours with bands such as Hondo Maclean, Monkey Boy and Colour of Fire. Due to unknown reasons, the relationship between the label and the band deteriorated, and soon saw both the departure of the band from the label, and of Steven from the band. He was replaced by Christopher Morgan, guitarist of local band The UCA Chapter,who was a friend of Scott and Matt and fan of the band. The band then set off on a headlining UK tour just days after the completed line-up. It was on this tour that it was decided to enrol long term friend Lyndon Jones into the band to trigger samples and play synthesiser to thicken out the band's sound. =Til Death Do Us Party= After touring relentlessly the band then took some time out to write and record their debut album with producer Nick Loyd who had previously engineered some demo material for the band at Strongbox Studio in Penarth. Several songs were written in these sessions including A Machine; the rhythm thief, and other working titles such as Body like Christmas-head like Halloween, and the recording process was covered heavily by Rocksound Magazine. Due to technical difficulties and personal strains the album took longer to materialise, initially titled The curse of Midasuno, the band decided to release the best of the tracks from the sessions as a mini-album \\"Til Death Do Us Party\\" which the band released in 2006 after signing a deal with Bristol-based label Sugar Shack Records. The band then returned to the road where they carved their niche in the British rock scene. The band announced they will play one final show with the original line up at Cardiff's Millennium music hall on 4 December 2010, before closing the door on Midasuno forever.

The piece was commissioned by U.S. President Bill Clinton to accompany a multimedia presentation titled The Unfinished Journey directed by Steven Spielberg for the 2000 \\"Millennium\\" celebrations. The work premiered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. on New Year‚Äôs Eve, 1999. Composition =Structure= Lasting approximately twenty-five minutes in performance, American Journey is composed in six short movements played without pause: #\\"Immigration and Building\\" #\\"The Country at War\\" #\\"Popular Entertainment\\" #\\"Arts and Sports\\" #\\"Civil Rights and the Women's Movement\\" #\\"Flight and Technology\\" =Style and influences= The first movement, \\"Immigration and Building,\\" contains quotes from Williams' score to the 1992 film Far and Away. Additionally, the style of the music would heavily anticipate his score to the 2000 film The Patriot. =Instrumentation= American Journey is scored for three flutes (II doubling on Irish flute, III doubling on piccolo), two oboes, English horn, three clarinets (III doubling on bass clarinet), three bassoons (III doubling on contrabassoon), six French horns, four trumpets, four trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (bass drum, chimes, cymbals, field drum, orchestral bells, small triangle, snare drum, suspended cymbal, tambourine, tamtam, triangle, vibraphone, xylophone), harp, piano, and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses) with optional accompaniment by two narrators. Reception The film music critic James Southall said of the work, \\"...it's fantastic music. At times reminiscent of some of his film music, it's still wonderfully bracing and vividly descriptive music.\\" Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks was slightly more critical of the piece, saying, \\"Even within the United States, Williams' style is distinctly tied to the East Coast, with the bulk of his efforts in tribute to New England, New York and the traditions of music unique in those regions of the country. The 'American Journey' suite has nothing, for instance, to musically represent California or the Rocky Mountain region.\\" Despite this criticism, Clemmensen nevertheless called the work \\"wholesome, entertaining music.\\" Discography A recording of American Journey was released January 15, 2002 on a compilation album by Sony Classical Records. The album also featured Williams' 1996 and 2002 Olympic themes, the NBC Nightly News theme The Mission, For New York, and various other celebratory works and fanfares for orchestra.

History The initial design and implementation of applying service-oriented computing in embedded systems and robots was presented in the 49th IFIP 10.4 Workgroups meeting in February 2006.Yinong Chen, \\"Service-Oriented Computing in Recomposable Embedded Systems\\", Joint IARP/IEEE-RAS/EURON/IFIP 10.4 Workshop on Dependability in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Tucson, AZ, February 15‚Äì19, 2006, http://webhost.laas.fr/TSF/IFIPWG/Workshops&Meetings;/49/workshop/04%20chen.pdf In the initial design, a robot is the service client that looks up the service registry and consumes Web services on remote sites. Evolved from service- oriented robot, Robot as a Service is an all-in-one SOA unit, that is, the unit includes services for performing functionality, service directory for discovery and publishing, and applications for client‚Äôs direct access.Yinong Chen, Zhihui Du, and Marcos Garcia-Acosta, M., \\"Robot as a Service in Cloud Computing\\", In Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering (SOSE), Nanjing, June, 2010, pp. 151‚Äì158. This all-in-one design gives the robot unit tools and capacity to be a self- contained cloud unit in the cloud computing environment. Based on RaaS concepts, a Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Language Environment (VIPLE) has been developed.  RaaS architecture  RaaS follows SOA and is a cloud computing unit. A RaaS unit acts as a service provider, a service broker, and as a service client: # A RaaS cloud unit is a service provider: Each unit hosts a repository of preloaded services. A developer or a client can deploy new services into or remove service from a robot. The services can be used by this robot and can also be shared with other robots. # A RaaS cloud contains a set of applications deployed: A developer or client can compose a new application (functionality) based on the services available in the unit and outside the unit. # A RaaS unit is a service broker: a client can look up the services and applications available in the unit‚Äôs directory. A client can search and discover the applications and services deployed on the robot by browsing the directory. The services and applications can be organized in a hierarchy of classes to facilitate the discovery. The main components of a RaaS unit and typical applications and services deployed. RaaS units are designed for the cloud computing environment. The services in RaaS will communicate with the drivers and other operating system components, which further communicate with the devices and other hardware components. The RaaS units can directly communicate with each other through Wi-Fi, if the wireless infrastructure is available or through ad hoc wireless network otherwise. The communication between RaaS and other services in the cloud are through standard service interface WSDL enabled by DPWS or RESTful service overall HTTP. A few prototypes of RaaS have been implemented, which include both Web interface and physical devices.Yinong Chen, \\"Service-Oriented Computing in Recomposable Embedded Systems\\", Joint IARP/IEEE-RAS/EURON/IFIP 10.4 Workshop on Dependability in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Tucson, AZ, February 15‚Äì19, 2006, http://webhost.laas.fr/TSF/IFIPWG/Workshops&Meetings;/49/workshop/04%20chen.pdfIntel Autobot Web Service, 2012, http://venus.eas.asu.edu/WSRepository/RaaS/main/RaaS online programming environment, 2013, http://venus.eas.asu.edu/WSRepository/eRobotic/Zhihui Du, Weiqiang Yang, Yinong Chen, Xin Sun, Xiaoying Wang, and Chen Xu, \\"Design of a Robot Cloud Center\\", in 10th International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS), Tokyo, March 2011, pp. 269‚Äì275.RaaS online programming environment, 2013, http://venus.eas.asu.edu/WSRepository/eRobotic/Robotics as a service implemented into robot, 2016, http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/qihan- sanbot/ Dependability, including reliability and security are critical in RaaS design. Collaborating RaaS units can be scheduled for redundant execution, backing up each other‚Äôs operations. The redundant design can also address the instruction-level attack such as code injection and Return Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks. As the redundant RaaS units are independent of each other, instruction-level gadget programming is likely to generate different sequences in different devices. These differences in behaviors can be detected by the collaboration among the RaaS units. The major challenge in designing RaaS is to deal with the diversity of the networks, applications, and the environments or end users. In cloud computing, the network and communication protocols are limited to a few standards such WSDL, SOAP, HTTP, and RESTful architecture. In RaaS, HTTP, SOAP, and WSDL standards and robotics applications are the main design considerations.  Applications  RaaS can be used in where SOA, cloud computing, IoT, CPS, and ADS are used. One the application in computer science education. RaaS uses existing services to compose different applications at workflow level, which significantly reduce the learning curve of robotics programming.Yinong Chen, Zhizheng Zhou, \\"Service-Oriented Computing and Software Integration in Computing Curriculum\\", IPDPS Workshops 2014, pp. 1091‚Äì1098.Yinong Chen, Zhizheng Zhou, \\"Robot as a Service in Computing Curriculum‚Äù, 12th International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS), Taichung, March 2015.

January On 5 January, the rebels recaptured the Majbal (Sawmills) area of al-Brej after fighting that killed or wounded no less than 20 soldiers. They also captured the southern entrance of the stone quarries known as al-Misat, forcing government troops to retreat to the north. Later, it was reported that the Islamic Front and Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar managed to seize the Manasher al-Brej area and were trying to advance and take control over al-Brej Hill with which they could seize the military supply road from the Aleppo Central Prison to the Handarat and al-Mallah areas. The next day, the rebels reportedly took control over the al-Akhdar Mosque, a mill and the al-Tawattor al-Aali area of al-Brej. The clashes reportedly left one rebel and 6 government fighters dead. On 8 January, the Army and pro-government militias conducted a counter-attack against areas seized by the rebels in previous days. On 22 January, the rebels reportedly advanced in al-Mallah and Seifat areas. On 24 January, rebels reportedly took control over some positions in al- Brej Hill after violent clashes against government forces supported by loyal militia. February On 3 February, rebels clashed with government troops around Handarat camp. The rebels reportedly seized al- Misat Hill in the northern eastern entrance of Aleppo. On 4 February, the Army retook Al-Misat Hill after the rebels held it for 2 hours. On 17 February, the Syrian Arab Army as well as Afghani and Iranian foreign fighters launched a major offensive in northern Aleppo, with the aim of cutting the last rebel supply routes into the city, as well as relieving the rebel siege of the Shi'a-majority towns of Zahra'a and Nubl to the north-west of Aleppo. Bad weather conditions and an inability to call up reinforcements ultimately stalled the government offensive. By 19 February, the rebels launched a counter offensive, retaking two out of four positions lost to government forces in the previous two days. 90 government forces were killed and 80 opposition fighters, with tens of prisoners taken on each side. A military source brought the name of over 78 Al Nusra fighters killed in the ongoing clashes in Northern Aleppo. March On 4 March, the rebels tunnel bombed part of the Air Force Intelligence building in the northeast of the city and then launched an assault in an attempt to capture the facility. The blast caused a 2.3 tremor registered by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre. The ensuing clashes left 20 soldiers and 14 rebels dead. The attack ultimately failed. On 9 March, opposition forces launched an assault on Handarat, north of Aleppo, after reportedly noticing confusion in the ranks of government troops after the February fighting. It was initially reported that opposition forces captured Handarat, north of Aleppo. However, later it was reported by opposition sources the rebels managed to capture only 40‚Äì50% of the village, while the Army remained in control of the northern portion of Handarat. A military source stated they still controlled 80% of Handarat, while a rebel field commander claimed that opposition forces controlled 75%. On 18 March, after almost 10 days of fighting, the military fully expelled the rebels from Handarat and re-established control of the village. April Rebel undermining of Al Hatab Square buildings in late April 2015 On 13 April, Islamist opposition forces and al-Nusra Front renewed their assault on the Air Force Intelligence building, again utilizing a tunnel bomb followed by an assault. Much of the Air Force Intelligence building was reportedly damaged as a result of the tunnel bomb. Between 27‚Äì29 April, the FSA and Ahrar ash-Sham launched an operation in the old city of Aleppo and around Al-Hatab Square in the Al-Jdayde District, which included tunnel bombs Video extract of undermine exposition in Jdeideh of late April 2015 is available on https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f4tk4lDMFj0ASOR Cultural Heritage Initiatives (CHI): Planning for Safeguarding Heritage Sites in Syria and Iraq1 NEA-‚ÄêPSHSS-‚Äê14-‚Äê001 Weekly Report 40 ‚Äî May 12, 2015 Available on http://www.asor-syrianheritage.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/ASOR_CHI_Weekly_Report_40r.pdf and shelling of buildings where soldiers were stationed. The rebels claimed to have killed 76 troops in these operations. June In preparation for a new offensive, the rebels heavily shelled government-held parts of the city, leaving 43 civilians dead and 190 wounded on 15 June. On 17 June, rebel forces captured the western neighborhood of Rashideen from government forces, and the day after, they also claimed to had pushed into the large Kurdish community of Khaldiyeh. State TV, however, denied both losses, and said the situation was relatively calm. The pro-opposition SOHR group confirmed only the rebel capture of Rashideen and that there was fighting in the outskirts of Khaldiyeh. The rebels also captured Tal Al-Afghani hill, near Bashkoy, north of the city. However, government troops recaptured the hill on 19 June. Throughout 19 and 20 June, a new round of rebel shelling killed 19 more civilians. The latest rebel assaults were reportedly the start of a large campaign, but except for mobilizing around the city and making the notable advance in Rashideen, the rebels had still not made major progress. July On 2 July, a major offensive was launched by two rebel coalitions, Fatah Halab and Ansar Sharia, the latter of which includes the Al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, with fighting focusing on the Jamiyat al-Zahra frontline. By the next day, the rebels seized some buildings in Jamiyat al-Zahra, but the advance was of no strategic importance and came at a cost of heavy casualties, with 35 rebels being killed amidst heavy air-strikes. At least 18 soldiers were killed in the fighting. On 4 July, the Fatah Halab managed to seize the Scientific Research Center on Aleppo's western outskirts, thus overcoming the first major government fortification and potentially threatening government-held areas of Aleppo. Still, government troops managed to recapture the areas they lost the previous day in Jamiyat al-Zahra. Later during the day, government fighters launched a counter-attack against the Scientific Research Center, and managed to enter the eastern outskirts of the Center but were forced to retreat outside the complex's walls after heavy shelling. 12 more rebels and 12 soldiers were killed in the clashes. As of 5 July, the attack on Jamiyat al-Zahra had largely failed, while the military was still attempting to recapture the Center. On the evening of 6 July, a suicide bomber hit government positions in Jamiyat al-Zahra, leaving 25 government fighters dead. The ensuing fighting also left 19 rebels dead and opposition activists claimed rebel forces managed to capture several buildings. Fighting also continued at the Center. It was reported on 20 July that the body of a kidnapped high ranking FSA-leader, Hussein Qintar, had been found by the wayside. The FSA 1st Lieutenant had been severely beaten and shot in the head by unknown assassins in the northern city of Aleppo. On 31 July, the rebels launched a failed attack on a military base in Aleppo's outskirts, leaving 25 rebels and nine soldiers dead. September On 22 September, two dozen tanks and 900 NDF reinforcements arrived in Aleppo, with the intent of recapturing the Scientific Facility. Several hundred additional NDF were expected in the coming days. October By October 2015, the SAA was reportedly still struggling to capture the Scientific Facility. On 2 October, however, 11 rebel combatants were killed in skirmishes with the SAA. On 8 October, Brigadier General Hossein Hamedani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was killed on the outskirts of Aleppo while on an advisory mission for the Syrian Armed Forces. On 9 October, the SAA and NDF reportedly captured Jabboul City from ISIL, in the Aleppo Governorate's eastern countryside, marking the Syrian government troops' first presence in the area in three years. On 10 October, the SAA and NDF attacked ISIL positions east of Aleppo, killing 15 of its fighters and capturing a hilltop as well as the rebel-held village of Duwayr Al-Zeitoun. It marked the first time the SAA had advanced in northern Aleppo since January 2015. By 13 October, ISIL captured four rebel-held villages northeast of Aleppo, while the Army seized the Syria-Turkey Free Trade Zone, the al-Ahdath juvenile prison and cement plant. On 14 October, fighting between ISIS and rebel groups started in the villages of Ahras and Tel Jabin, while more fighting occurred in the rural lands north of Aleppo.http://www.newsweek.com/isis-battles- syrian-rebels-assads-army-prepares-battle-aleppo-383550 While Russian planes bombed several buildings and vehicles at the headquarters of Jabhat al-Nusra, outside of Aleppo. On 16 October, the army launched their large-scale southern Aleppo offensive after almost one year of inactivity along the rural area in the Azzan Mountains. The army captured the villages of Abtin, al-Waddihi, and Qalaat Al-Najam, along with the Defense Battalion Base and the farms surrounding it. The main objective of the army's southern Aleppo offensive was to recapture the Azzan Mountains from the rebels, while also creating a larger buffer-zone around the Syrian Government's only highway leading to the provincial capital. On 17 October a US official said that up to 2,000 Iran- backed forces had been deployed in Aleppo. While a member of Al Nusra (Saudi national Sanafi Al Nasr) was killed in an airstrike in the Aleppo province, along with two other prominent members of Al Nusra. It is not known whether it was an American or Russian airstrike that killed the three.

It was developed by the Belgian-Dutch biotech company Galapagos NV. The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), upper respiratory tract infection (nose and throat infection), urinary tract infection and dizziness. Filgotinib was approved for medical use in both the European Union and Japan in September 2020.  Medical uses  Filgotinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease‚Äëmodifying anti‚Äërheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Filgotinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX). Mechanism of action Filgotinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor with selectivity for subtype JAK1 of this enzyme. It is considered a promising agent as it inhibits JAK1 selectively, similar to already marketed upadacitinib. Less selective JAK inhibitors (e.g. tofacitinib and baricitinib) are already being marketed. They show long-term efficacy in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. However, their lack of selectivity leads to dose-limiting side effects. It is thought that inhibition of all JAK isoenzymes is beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. However, pan-JAK inhibition might also lead to unwanted side effects that might not outweigh its benefits. This is the rationale for the development of newer and more selective inhibitors like filgotinib. The signal transmission of large numbers of proinflammatory cytokines is dependent on JAK1. Inhibition of JAK2 may also contribute to the efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. Nonetheless it is thought that JAK2 inhibition might lead to anemia and thrombopenia by interference with erythropoietin and thrombopoietin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Therefore, one might prefer to choose a more selective JAK1 inhibitor as a primary therapeutic option. Filgotinib exerts a 30-fold selectivity for JAK1 compared to JAK2. It is however still to be seen to what extent JAK2 inhibition should be avoided.

Research  =Clinical trials= The efficacy of filgotinib is being studied in a Phase IIb program (DARWIN trial 1, 2) with involvement of 886 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 180 Crohn's disease patients. Phase I study It was shown in Phase I studies that the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib metabolism is independent of hepatic CYP450 enzymatic degradation. The drug metabolism is however mediated by carboxylesterases. There is no interference reported with the metabolism of methotrexate nor with any of the investigated transport proteins. Phase II study: Proof of concept (2011) In November 2011 Galapagos released the results of their Phase II study (identification: NCT01384422, Eudract: 2010-022953-40) in which 36 rheumatoid arthritis patients were treated who showed a suboptimal clinical response to methotrexate treatment. Three groups of twelve patients were treated either with 200 mg filgotinib in a single dose, 200 mg divided in two doses or placebo. The primary end-point was the ACR20 score, which monitors improvements in the symptomatology of the patient. After the scheduled 4 weeks of treatment, 83% of the respondents showed an improved ACR20-score. Half of the treated patients showed a complete (or near complete) remission of the disease. There were no reports of anemia nor changes in lipidemia. The company stated in their press release that filgotinib is the first selective JAK1 inhibitor that shows clinical efficacy. As a result of this study, the company stated that \\"GLPG0634 shows one of the highest initial response rates ever reported for rheumatoid arthritis treatments\\". DARWIN 1 trial The DARWIN 1 trial was a 24-week double blind placebo-controlled trial with 599 rheumatoid arthritis patients enrolled. All participants had moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and showed an insufficient response to standard methotrexate treatment. The trial compared three dosages of filgotinib as a once or twice per day regimen. During the trial all participants remained on their methotrexate treatment. The trial completed in Feb 2015 and the results were released in July 2015. Galapagos announced that the drug met key efficacy endpoints, showed ACR70 responses up to 39%, and maintained its safety profile. DARWIN 2 trial The DARWIN 2 trial was a double blind placebo- controlled trial with 280 rheumatoid arthritis patients enrolled who show an insufficient response to standard methotrexate treatment. In contrast to the previous DARWIN 1 trial, methotrexate was discontinued. Therefore, this trial investigates filgotinib as a second-line monotherapy. The recruitment of DARWIN trial 2b ended in November 2014. In August 2015, Galapagos announced that the study confirmed previous results. DARWIN 3 trial Patients who completed DARWIN 1 and 2 were eligible for DARWIN 3. In November 2017, the company announced consistent safety findings and durable activity at week 84 in the trial. The estimated study completion timeframe is May 2019.  FINCH Phase III trials  FINCH 1 looks at patients where first-line treatment with methotrexate (MTX) is not working. It compares filgotinib versus adalimumab/Humira versus a placebo. FINCH 2 looks at patients where a biologic is not working. FINCH 3 looks at filgotinib as a first-line treatment unlike previous studies that investigated the drug as a second-line treatment. FINCH 2 trial revealed patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more DMARDs, filgotinib showed significance in treatment response compared with placebo.  MANTA  Due to concerns over testicular toxicity in males, the MANTA study is examining the safety of the drug in the context of treating ulcerative colitis. Despite these concerns, the FDA allowed a 200-mg daily dose for males in the Phase III FINCH trials.

He first achieved fame for his discovery in 1974 that T lymphocytes recognized chemically modified surface antigens only in the context of self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encoded molecules,Shearer, G.

M., Role of the murine major histocompatibility complex in the specificity of in vitro T-cell-mediated lympholysis against chemically- modified autologous lymphocytes. Transplant Rev 1976. 29: 222-246. His discovery of MHC restriction using chemically modified surface antigens was simultaneous with the discovery of MHC restricted T lymphocyte recognition of virus infected cells by Rolf Zinkernagel and Peter Doherty, who received the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.Zinkernagel, R. M. and Doherty, P. C., Restriction of in vitro T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in lymphocytic choriomeningitis within a syngeneic or semiallogeneic system. Nature 1974. 248: 701-702. When the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic was first identified, Shearer realized that the immune deficiencies occurring in AIDS patients closely resembled the immune deficiencies occurring in experimental murine models of graft versus host disease that he had been studying.Shearer, G., Immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) A consequence of allogeneic Ia-antigen recognition.

Science 1975. 190: 890-893. Consequently, in 1983 Shearer was one of the first immunologists to begin studying the immune dysregulation in AIDS patients and discovered that infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resulted in CD4+ T cell dysfunction and immune dysregulation long before the onset of overt clinical disease.Clerici, M. and Shearer, G. M., The Th1-Th2 hypothesis of HIV infection: new insights. Immunol Today 1994. 15: 575-581.Shearer, G. M., Payne, S. M., Joseph, L. J. and Biddison, W.

At the height of the AIDS epidemic when public concern about HIV exposure was at its peak, Shearer's research revealed that T cell immunity to HIV was protective, providing hope to an increasingly concerned public that HIV infection could be contained.Clerici, M., Berzofsky, J.

Biography Shearer was born and raised in Monticello in rural Kentucky. In 1961, he earned a B.Sc. degree in biology at Western Kentucky State College and, in 1967, earned a Ph.D. in Radiation Biology from the University of Tennessee Knoxville in the laboratory of Gustavo Cudkowicz with whom he studied lymphoid stem cells. After a post-doctoral fellowship examining genetic regulation of immune responses to synthetic protein antigens with Michael Sela at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, Shearer started his own laboratory in 1972 at the National Cancer Institute, a part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. Shearer published nearly 500 research papers in both basic and clinical immunology from his laboratory and trained over 50 postdoctoral fellows and students before retiring in 2014 at age 77 from the National Cancer Institute's Experimental Immunology Branch of which he was a founding member. Shearer lives in Bethesda, MD. He married Minetta Stone in 1966; they have two sons. Shearer's interests include cycling and playing autoharp and harmonica with his musical group, the Half-Right Band.

Described as new to science in 2014, it is found in northwest China, where it grows singly or in scattered groups on moss-covered soil in Picea crassifolia forests. Taxonomy The type collection was made in Haichaoba, Minle County, China in August 2013 at an altitude of . Molecular phylogenetic analysis places the fungus in the section Bivelares (subsection Hortenses) of the genus Agaricus. Agaricus subsubensis was the most closely related species of congeners included in the analysis. The specific epithet taeniatus alludes to the partial veil remnants that remain on the surface of the stipe. Description The cap shape is initially roughly hemispherical with a flattened top, then expands to become flattened with a wavy margin, with a size range of . The cap surface is covered with small brownish scales. The gills are free from attachment to the stipe, and spaced so that there are between 13 and 24 gills per cm at the cap margin. They are initially white, later turning light pink, light brown, and then dark brown after the spores mature. The cylindrical stipe measures long. It has a persistent ring measuring wide. The stipe surface features small, pressed-down scales above the ring, and more fluffy scales below the ring. Spores are more or less spherical to broadly ellipsoid, and measure 5.7‚Äì7.1 by 6.8‚Äì8.6 ¬µm. They are thick-walled and smooth, and lack a germ pore.

Through his great-grandfather James Shirley Leakey (1824‚Äì1871), one of the eleven children of the portrait painter James Leakey, he is related to the missionary Henry Leakey, so to paleoanthropologists Louis Leakey and Richard Leakey. His older brother Nigel Leakey was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross in 1945, for his actions in Ethiopia in 1941. Another relative Joshua Leakey was awarded the Victoria Cross in 2015, for his actions in Afghanistan in 2013.

He was educated at boarding school in Kenya, and then at Weymouth College in England. After attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he became a second lieutenant in the Royal Tank Corps in 1936. Leakey served with the 1st Battalion in Egypt, where he helped with the invention of the Coles Universal Sun Compass. He was promoted to lieutenant in January 1939. Second World War Leakey was serving on the staff of the 4th Armoured Brigade when the Second World War broke out in September 1939. Leakey rejoined his unit, renamed the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, fighting in a Mark VI tank. He commanded a troop and then a squadron, and won the Military Cross at Martuba on 21 January 1941, fighting against Italian forces during Operation Compass. After German forces arrived in North Africa, Leakey's regiment was sent to form part of the garrison at Tobruk in April 1941. Despite constant attacks from the German Afrika Korps that was besieging Tobruk, Leakey grew bored of garrison life; although by then a temporary captain, he volunteered to serve as a private soldier with the 2/23rd Australian Infantry Battalion for three months. He was awarded a Bar to the Military Cross for actions of 9 August 1941, while serving with the Australians: he is believed to be the only captain in the British Army serving as a lance corporal in the Australian army to win the MC. His exploits were later recounted by The Victor comic in the 1960s.The Victor', Issue 437 (5 July 1969), ComicBookDB.com Leakey was then sent to the Staff College in Haifa. He detoured to visit his father in Kenya, and heard that his older brother Nigel Leakey had died in combat at Kolito in Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) in May 1941, while serving with the King's African Rifles, for which he was later awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. Leakey learned to fly while serving as a Air Intelligence Liaison Officer with No. 451 Squadron RAAF, and was then asked to join the 252nd Indian Armoured Brigade in Persia. Before he left, he returned to visit his regiment near Tobruk towards the end of May 1942. He found himself embroiled in the opening stage of Battle of Gazala, and he was nearly captured by General Rommel (the commander of the 7th Armoured Division Frank Messervy was captured briefly). Leakey then served as a turret gunner in a Grant tank, before replacing a wounded officer as GSO2 in the headquarters of the 7th Armoured Division. He eventually went to Persia in July 1942, after Rommel's advance stalled near El Alamein. He transferred back to the 44th Royal Tank Regiment in North Africa, and landed at Taranto after Operation Slapstick as the second-in-command of the 44th RTR, fighting up the east coast of Italy. After returning to England, he landed in Normandy with the 5th Royal Tank Regiment, and fought in Operation Jupiter near Maltot, dominated by Hill 112, then at Le Havre, and with the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade at the Siege of Dunkirk, winning a Czechoslovak War Cross. He continued to command the 5th RTR (and for a time the 7th Royal Tank Regiment) as Allied forces fought through the Netherlands, and into Germany, until VE Day in May 1945. He volunteered for service in the Far East but the war ended before he arrived. Leakey was promoted to the substantive rank of captain in 1944, and was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order in 1945 for his leadership of 5th RTR. Although at the time a temporary lieutenant colonel, he was too young at 29-year-old to hold the substantive rank. Post-war career Leakey commanded the 5th RTR in Europe until 1947.

Its main campus is located in Rapho Township, Pennsylvania, approximately five miles southwest of the borough of Manheim, Pennsylvania. By 2011, it was the thirty-eighth largest church in the United States, with a weekly attendance of 10,147. LCBC has continued to grow: in 2013, it was the tenth fastest-growing church in the United States, with a weekly attendance of 13,854, twenty-seven percent larger than at the beginning of 2012. As of 2019, LCBC claimed 17,000 weekly attendees. In 2006, LCBC's main campus had reached capacity, but further building expansion was ruled out by local officials. By then the church had shortened its name from Lancaster County Bible Church to \\"LCBC,\\" a name change it made official in 2008. Shortly thereafter, LCBC opened its first satellite location in Swatara Township, Pennsylvania, near the state's capital, Harrisburg. At that time, LCBC's annual budget was roughly $9 million.

The type-species of the genus is Calydiscoides australis Young, 1969. Morphology Lamellodisc of Calydiscoides euzeti All species of Calydiscoides are small animals, ranging 0.5‚Äì1 mm in length. As with most monogeneans, they are flat, with an anterior head bearing four oculi and head glands, a main elongate body and a posterior haptor. The digestive system includes an anterior muscular pharynx, and two lateral intestinal branches (or caeca); as in all Platyhelminthes, there is no anus. The haptor, in the posterior part of the body, is a specialized organ used to attach to the host. The haptor includes sclerotized elements, namely a ventral bar, two lateral (dorsal) bars, two ventral hooks, and two dorsal hooks, and fourteen hooklets. As in most diplectanids, the haptor bears characteristic, structures called squamodiscs (one ventral and one dorsal). The squamodiscs of species of Calydiscoides are special: they are lamellodiscs, which are made up of concentric lamellae, not separate rodlets as in regular squamodiscs. The diameter of the lamellodiscs range 25‚Äì60 ¬µm. When observed from its concentric axis (ventral or dorsal observation of the specimen, ‚Äòpolar‚Äô view of the lamellodisc), the lamellodisc appears as concentric circles. Generally, central lamellae are circles, but peripheral lamellae may be circles or semicircles. Adults are hermaphroditic. The reproductive organ include a single ovary and a single testis. As in all diplectanids, the ovary (or germarium) is anterior to the testis and loops around the right intestinal caecum. Species of Calydiscoides are characterized by a sclerotized male copulatory organ, which is used in systematics to differentiate species. Systematics The characteristics of the lamellodisc, without paired elements, is the main character which differentiate Calydiscoides from other genera of the family Diplectanidae. Relationships of Calydiscoides Young, 1969 with Protolamellodiscus Oliver, 1969 are not clear; the two genera were described almost simultaneously, and it might be that they are synonym. Hosts Hosts of species of Calydiscoides are only members of the families Nemipteridae (Threadfin breams) and Lethrinidae (Emperors). These families are restricted to the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Lethrinids known to harbour Calydiscoides species include Lethrinus miniatus, Lethrinus nebulosus and Lethrinus atkinsoni; nemipterids include Nemipterus japonicus, Scolopsis temporalis, Scolopsis monogramma, Scolopsis margaritifera and Pentapodus aureofasciatus. In all cases, species of Calydiscoides were only found on the gills of the fish.

They are mid-way in height between dunes and ripples; they are not well understood. One possible mechanism for their formation is that larger grains like pebbles are rolled on top of smaller ripples; then, finer dust settles into the cracks, making the TAR larger than typical ripples.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_042625_1655 TARs are often seen in low places like valley floors. Currently, they are not moving. TARs are most common near the equator. In a study reported in the planetary journal Icarus, TARs seem to be similar to landforms in the Lut desert of Iran. The measurements of length, width, height, and wavelength of the landforms in the Lut Desert and TARs on Mars overlap. Lut bedforms are classified as mega- ripples, hence Martian TARs may also be mega-ripples.Hugenholts, C., T. Barchyn. 2017.

Following stints in the UK, Switzerland, US and China, he left P&G; as Managing Director of DACH in 2010. For Conze this experience taught him the importance of innovation and geographic breadth. =Dyson= Conze joined Dyson as President, North America in 2010 and in September 2011 Conze succeeded Martin McCourt as Chief Executive Officer of Dyson. He had been inspired by James Dyson‚Äôs story and the two operated hand in hand harmoniously. Dyson saw its sales revenue doubled and investment in new technology increased to 3 times during Max‚Äôs term. Conze ran a group with more than 4,400 employees around the world including the UK head office; a Malaysian factory where the bulk of production is carried out, a second technology campus named Hullavington in Malmesbury and a new motor facility in Singapore. Under Conze‚Äôs leadership, Dyson experienced strong growth and entered new categories. 2016 saw the launch of the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer, the Dyson V8 cord-free vacuum and the introduction of the Dyson Demo shop. Dyson's then-CEO Max Conze said, ‚Äú2016 was one of our best years yet, driven by new technology and international growth. Our future is best understood by looking at the new Dyson demo stores. They get people hands-on with Dyson machines to understand the intelligent technology inside.‚Äù Conze led Dyson through a period of expansion, announcing the new Hullavington campus in February 2017 as a part of plans to increase the company‚Äôs workforce of engineers and scientists to around 7000 in the next five years. In March 2017, Dyson revealed that its profits for 2016 topped ¬£630 million after company recorded a 244 percent growth in China markets. Dyson announced a ¬£1.5bn investment into research and development of future technologies. The plan was rooted in an ongoing expansion of Dyson engineering, working with universities to develop a technology pipeline that stretches 25 years into the future. Conze is passionate about the potential of young people and the benefits of recruiting talent fresh out of university, believing that they are more willing to take risks and think unconventionally. Conze left Dyson under acrimonious circumstances in October 2017. =ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE= Conze joins ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE to the 1st of June as the new CEO.

The northern boundary of the parish follows approximately the B4040 Malmesbury‚ÄìSwindon road. The Bristol Avon forms part of the boundary to the west and south, and its tributary the Brinkworth Brook forms part of the southeastern boundary.  History  Eight estates were recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at Sumreford, with altogether 80 households. The 'Little' prefix began to be used in the 16th century to distinguish the parish from neighbouring Great Somerford. A school for 100 pupils was built in 1868 to replace an earlier schoolroom, and was extended in 1894. Children of all ages attended until 1954, when those aged 11 and over transferred to the secondary schools at Malmesbury. The school closed in 1982 when a new school was opened in Great Somerford to serve both villages. The South Wales Main Line railway from London to Bristol and South Wales passes close to the village. Little Somerford had a station from the opening of the line in 1903, and in 1933 the junction with the Malmesbury Branch Line was moved here (at the opening of the branch in 1877 it was connected to the Great Western Main Line at Dauntsey, to the south). Passenger service on the branch ceased in 1951 and the branch was closed in 1962. Little Somerford station was closed in 1963. Church Church of St John the Baptist The first record of a church at Little Somerford is in 1251. The church was rebuilt c. 1300 although the nave may survive from the earlier building. The tower and porch were added in the 15th century; restoration was carried out in 1860. The timber chancel screen was begun in the 14th century. A boarded tympanum from the 15th century is described by Historic England as \\"exceptional\\", although the lower part is missing: it is painted with two angels and the Commandments. The tower arch carries a large royal coat of arms dated 1602, moved here in 1983 from the tympanum to reveal the painting. The 15th-century tympanum The pulpit is dated 1626, and the pews in the nave are box pews from the same century, now cut down to make benches. The three bells in the tower were recast in the 18th century. The tower screen of 1928 is by Robert Lorimer. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1959. From 1952 and again from 1967, the benefice was held in plurality with Great Somerford. Later in 1967 the benefice was united with Great Somerford and Seagry, and the benefice of Corston with Rodbourne was added in 1986. Today St John's is one of six churches in the Woodbridge Group. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

She was the magazine's religion expert and a passionate critic of Islam. Since the killings, she has become a prominent secularist and human rights campaigner, speaking publicly around the world about Islam and free speech. She left Charlie Hebdo on January 3, 2017, citing the magazine's adoption of an \\"editorial line demanded by Islamists\\" as one of the reasons for her departure.

At the library she read early Islamic writings, which she found to be more thoughtful and open to critical analysis than contemporary Islam. She wrote a master's degree on Muslims in Morocco who convert to Christianity. She later said that she \\"wanted to understand how they first could put out the enormous intellectual effort that it takes to escape from one form of brainwashing, only to voluntarily join another religion.\\" Rhazoui began her career as a journalist in Morocco working for a weekly paper that was shut down by the regime in 2010. She published a number of articles about religious minorities in the journal Le Journal Hebdomadaire, which was banned by the Moroccan government in 2010. She is the founder of several organizations, including the pro-democracy, pro-secularism movement MALI, which she co-founded with Ibtissam Lachgar in August 2009. She was arrested three times by the Moroccan government for criticizing it. One of the crimes for which she was arrested was a protest picnic in 2009, which involved her eating lunch in a public park during Ramadan. She was eventually forced into exile in Slovenia. She later went to Paris to study, and became a spokeswoman for the feminist organization Ni Putes Ni Soumises (\\"Neither Whores Nor Submitted [Women]\\"), for which she worked helping Muslim women in oppressive family relationships. At the Sorbonne she studied Arabic, English, and French. =Charlie Hebdo= In 2011, during the Arab Spring, Charlie Hebdo asked to interview her about her participation in the struggles in Morocco. At a lunch, editors St√©phane \\"Charb\\" Charbonnier and Laurent \\"Riss\\" Sourisseau invited her to join an editorial meeting on the coming Wednesday. She was then offered and accepted a job with the magazine.

She was described by the International Business Times as \\"a secularist and human rights campaigner\\". In February 2015, she received death threats from ISIS. =Charlie Hebdo massacre= On 7 January 2015, Rhazoui was at her home in Casablanca, Morocco, having had her Christmas holiday extended. She sent an article about ISIS's views of women to her editor at Charlie Hebdo and then went back to bed. Two hours later she was awoken by her ringing phone. It was a friend telling her about the massacre at the magazine's offices. During the next few hours, she would learn that twelve of her friends and colleagues had been murdered. She later told Aftenposten that she believed herself to have been one of the terrorists' main targets. She said: \\"Those of us who are alive are alive only because of small coincidences.\\" In a 9 January article for Le Monde, she recalled her massacred colleagues and praised Charlie Hebdo as an \\"edgy newspaper\\" but one that \\"never takes itself seriously.\\" She stated that \\"Charlie has never been a newspaper like any other\\" and that her colleagues had been murdered \\"because we dared to deride Islam.\\" A meeting room once \\"accustomed to jokes and laughter\\" had become the site of a \\"bloodbath.\\" Charb, she remembered, was always worried about the newspaper dying but \\"cared little about his own death, he who had been under police protection since 2012.\\" Addressing him, she said: \\"If you had been here, my Charb, if only you could have seen the place de la R√©publique, packed with people, people in tears wearing your portrait in a monastic silence.\\" She contributed to Charlie Hebdo issue No. 1178, which was published the week after the killings. =Post-massacre= Rhazoui speaking at De Balie in Amsterdam in 2018 After the massacre, extensive security routines became a part of Rhazoui's life.

In January 2015 she toured Quebec for a fund-raiser for Charlie Hebdo, and also spoke about Islam and freedom. \\"Secularism as far as I know, is the only way to permit everyone to live in the same society, even if people are different,\\" she stated, adding that Islam \\"needs to submit to secularism and it also needs to get a sense of humour.\\" In February 2015 she received death threats via Twitter that she described as \\"a fatwa 2.0.\\" Several people online have written that it is their \\"obligation\\" to find her and kill her in order to avenge the prophet. Her husband has also been targeted. In that month, thousands of supporters of the ISIS jihadist group called for lone-wolf terrorists to target el-Rhazoui. They tweeted under a hashtag translated as #MustKillZinebElRhazouiInRetaliationForTheProphet and posted her personal details, pictures of her husband and sister, and a map showing places she had visited, along with photographs of ISIS beheadings. In addition, reward money has been offered for information on her or her husband's residence or workplace. In March 2015, she gave a talk about the freedom of expression at the University of Chicago Law School in Chicago.Who Is Charlie? Charlie Hebdo Journalist Zineb El Rhazoui on Freedom of Expression Her visit to Chicago, sponsored by the university's French Club, marked the first time a Charlie Hebdo journalist spoke in the United States since the attack. She was profiled on April 2, 2015, in a long article in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten. In April 2015, she moved from Casablanca to Paris. On September 10, 2016, Rhazoui announced her intention to quit Charlie Hebdo during an interview on Web7Radio. According to her, the magazine is \\"under full police surveillance\\" and not the same as it used to be prior to the massacre. She formalized her departure on January 3, and criticized the magazine three days later, on the eve of the massacre's second anniversary, for following the \\"editorial line demanded by Islamists\\" and for no longer being motivated to draw Muhammad. She became the subject of a documentary titled Rien n'est pardonn√© (\\"Nothing is Forgiven\\"), directed by Vincent Coen and Guillaume Vandenberghe and co- produced by Belgium's Francophone RTBF network. It chronicles her life from 2011, during the Arab Spring in Morocco, to 2016. The film appeared at the 2017 Festival International de Programmes Audiovisuels in Biarritz, and at the 2018 One World Film Festival in Prague. Views Rhazoui receiving an award from the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain One of the texts in which she has most thoroughly set forth her views on Islam, the concept of anti-Muslim racism, Western attitudes toward Islam, and related issues was a response to a harsh December 2013 critique by Olivier Cyran of her work for Charlie Hebdo. Rhazoui rejected Cyran's charge that she is an anti-Muslim \\"racist,\\" and that she \\"contracted this dangerous syndrome from the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo.\\" The operating premise underlying this charge, she stated, was \\"that the Muslims of Azerbaijan, of Bosnia, of Malaysia, Egypt or Burkina Faso, represent a single whole that can be designated as a 'race.'\\" If they are indeed all one race, she said, then \\"that‚Äôs the one I belong to. The fact that I‚Äôm an atheist, and proud of it? It makes no difference, since you don‚Äôt ask us what we think; you talk about racism, and therefore race.\\" She also explained to Cyran the nuances of racial identity in North Africa, pointing out that the \\"Arabs\\" of Morocco often aren't Arabs at all but Berbers, and pointed out that while some North Africans are atheists and others are \\"agnostics, skeptics, free-thinkers, deists,\\" or Christian converts, he had \\"chosen to defend\\" a single group, the \\"militant Islamists\\": > Those are the ones who, given the reality of French la√Øcit√©, have no other > choice than to cry racism, a tear in their eye and a hand on their heart, on > the pretext that their \\"religious feelings\\" have been mocked by a drawing in > Charlie. Among them you will find many who stand for la√Øcit√© in France but > vote Ennahda in Tunisia, who do their shopping at a Parisian halal butcher > but would cry scandal if an eccentric decided to open a charcuterie in > Jeddah. Who are outraged when a day care center fires a veiled employee but > say nothing when someone they know forces his daughter to wear the veil. > They are a minority. But they are the standard to which you have chosen to > align the identity of all of us. She further observed that Cyran, in condemning her work as \\"racist,\\" had in fact omitted to give her name, indicating either that she did not \\"want to let Charlie Hebdo‚Äôs detractors (who can only subscribe to your thinking if they never read the paper) know that the author of these racist ravings belongs precisely to the Muslim 'race,' or you simply didn‚Äôt think that, as a person, I was worth naming, since in a fascist rag like Charlie I couldn‚Äôt be anything but the house Arab.\\" She concluded that the notion of someone named \\"Zineb who spits on Islam\\" was \\"beyond\\" Cyran. For him, she stated, \\"a 'white person' who spits on Christianity is anticlerical, but an Arab who spits on Islam is alienated, an alibi, a house Arab, an incoherence that one would prefer not even to name.\\" This, to her, suggested that in Cyran's view \\"people of my race, and myself, are congenitally sealed off from the ubiquitous ideas of atheism and anticlericalism,\\" or, perhaps, that \\"unlike other peoples, our identity is solely structured by religion.\\" Noting that Moroccan laws \\"do not grant me a quarter of the rights you acquired at birth,\\" and that if she were raped \\"the websites that posted your article will definitely say I was asking for it because I don‚Äôt respect Islam,\\" she observed that Cyran himself had implicitly endorsed all of this by embracing the \\"whole moralizing discourse about how one must 'respect Islam,' as demanded by the Islamists, who do not ask whether Islam respects other religions, or other people. Why the hell should I respect Islam? Does it respect me? The day Islam shows the slightest bit of consideration to women, first of all, and secondly toward free- thinkers, I promise you I will rethink my positions.\\" See also * Maghrebian community of Paris References Category:1982 births Category:21st-century French journalists Category:Charlie Hebdo people Category:Former Muslim critics of Islam Category:French atheism activists Category:French atheists Category:Former Muslims turned agnostics or atheists Category:French columnists Category:French feminist writers Category:French former Muslims Category:French women journalists Category:French people of Moroccan-Berber descent Category:Living people Category:Moroccan atheists Category:Moroccan emigrants to France Category:Moroccan feminists Category:Moroccan former Muslims Category:Moroccan human rights activists Category:Paris-Sorbonne University alumni Category:People from Casablanca Category:People from Paris Category:Writers from Paris Category:Opposition to Islam in France Category:Opposition to Islam in Morocco Category:Women columnists ","title":"Zineb El Rhazoui"},{"id":"45516142","text":"This is a list of French television related events from 2006.

The Code Letters DJVW, and fishing registration HF 338 were allocated. She was renamed Hessen in 1939. In 1940, Hessen was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine. She was converted to a weather ship and commissioned as WBS 11 Hessen on 8 July. In July 1940, she operated in northern Norwegian waters. She then underwent repairs in Trondheim. In July and August 1942, she was refitted at Assens, Denmark. Her hull was strengthened to enable her to operate in ice. On completion of the refit, she sailed to Kiel. It was planned that she would be part of Operation Nussbaum, which was to land a weather party on the Norwegian Arctic island of Spitsbergen. It was later decided that the personnel would be taken to Spitsbergen by U-boat and Hessen transported supplies to Narvik, Norway instead. In July 1943, Hessen underwent repairs at Copenhagen, Denmark. She was reclassified as an auxiliary warship on 20 September. She was stationed between Spitsbergen and the east coast of Greenland, serving as a weather ship. In November, she was in Narvik, moving to Troms√∏ the following month. Operation Einsiedler, which was to establish a weather station on Bear Island, had been delayed by Allied activity off the coast of Norway during this time. Hessen sailed on 7 January but the crankshaft of her engine broke on 10 January. She then drifted for two days before being taken in tow by . She arrived at Troms√∏ on 20 January.

Best known in Israel as founder of the Department of Artistic Ceramics at the Harsa factory in Beersheba, Azaz made his studio base in Oxfordshire, England from the late 1960s onwards, working in stained glass, wood, concrete, bronze, brass, copper and aluminium. Biography Born in 1923 and taken to Palestine at an early age, Azaz's early career developed alongside, and in relation to, the formation of the state of Israel. He was the founder and first director of the Department of Artistic Ceramics at the Harsa factory in Beersheba in 1955 where he designed the first generation of ceramics. His private ceramic work featured in an exhibition at Wakefield Gallery in 1955, alongside L S Lowry and Josef Herman; his ceramic sculpture is included in London's Victoria & Albert Museum collection.\\"V&A; Collections\\", Stoneware form with creamy glaze, by Nehemiah Azaz, ca. 1954, Last update November 4, 2015 He was also jewellery designer for collections exported through the Maskit initiative of Ruth Dayan and others. In 1960 he left Harsa to concentrate on large-scale architectural sculpture and stained glass. Influenced by the art of 1950s/60s, he was just as much inspired by the natural forms of the desert, mythology and the human condition. After a highly successful and high-profile architectural art commission at the Sheraton Hotel in Tel Aviv in 1965, he became one of the first Israeli sculptors of his generation to be commissioned internationally. Later, at the invitation of Yitzhak Rabin, then Israeli Ambassador in Washington, DC, Azaz - living in UK as artist in residence at Carmel College, UK, carved a 30 square metre walnut wood wall for the Israeli Lounge (along with a ceiling mural by artist Shraga Weil and painted fabric by Ezekiel Kimche) at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. His career as an architectural and stained glass artist then continued largely in US and UK, where he made his studio base and home in Oxfordshire from the late 1960s onwards. There are a number of large scale public art pieces still in existence, including at the Loop Synagogue in Chicago;\\"Chicago Loop Synagogue\\" homepage, retrieved November 23, 2015 Belfast Synagogue, Pace University in Manhattan NY and in the Israel Lounge at the John F Kennedy Centre in Washington, DC. Artistic career =Studio pottery and design = After his time in Europe, Azaz returned to Israel to take up the position of head of the ceramic art department at Harsa[In Hebrew] in Beersheba. Joined by young and enthusiastic artists such as Dan Arbeid, he designed and made sculptural pottery artworks influenced by the contours, shapes and colours of the desert, and also designed pieces that were made and decorated by others. The idea of Maskit was to enable √©migr√© craftspeople to adapt their skills and Azaz was instrumental in their training and encouragement. =Stained glass windows= Azaz's first commercial stained glass was a commission on board the Zim Lines cruise liner S/S Moledet, which routinely sailed between New York and Haifa in the early 1960s. His technique of using pieces of intensely coloured glass, became a hallmark in his other glasswork commissions. Large stained glass window projects include synagogue windows at Carmel College, praised by art and architecture scholar Nikolaus Pevsner as using \\"extraordinary technique with rough pieces of coloured glass like crystals\\" and by Historic England as \\"brilliant and innovative artistic glass\\";\\"Jewish Synagogue at Carmel College\\" Historic England List Entry, retrieved November 24, 2015 at Marble Arch Synagogue (over a period of 17 years); at Headington Hill Hall, once the former HQ of Pergamon Press,\\"Headington Hill Hall\\" Historic England List Entry, retrieved November 25, 2015 (now part of Oxford Brookes University campus) in Oxford, UK and at Temple Sholom in Chicago. Azaz's influence in glass work was also seen in his collaboration with the Shafrir Glass works, where he consulted on designs for household glassware. =Carved wood sculpture= Carving large wood sculpture has been a feature of Azaz's career from his earliest sculpting period, and also as the one of the preferred materials for small maquettes of his large-scale bronze work. The largest wooden piece, entitled Old Testament Musical Instruments,\\"John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts\\" Israeli Lounge, retrieved March 2, 2020 a 30 square metre carved walnut wall gifted by the State of Israel, is located in the Israeli Lounge\\"Artistic Gifts to the Kennedy Center and the Artists Who Created Them\\" in-house publication of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, retrieved November 24, 2015 at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC. Several other carved wooden pieces still in existence are located in public institutions in Israel including the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre at Tel-Hashomer. = Large scale architectural commissions in concrete = Azaz's architectural work appeared in early on his career, as features of a rapidly growing Tel-Aviv in the 1960s and 1970s featuring on civic buildings and incorporated into the fabric of new constructions such as the Sheraton Hotel, Plaza Hotel, Hilton Hotel, Architects and Engineering Associates Building and Hennig House Diamond Center, Ramat-Gan.

Roy was an advocate of free expression in Bangladesh, coordinating international protests against government censorship and imprisonment of atheist bloggers. He was hacked to death by machete-wielding assailants in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on 26 February 2015; Islamic militant organization Ansarullah Bangla Team claimed responsibility for the attack. Early life and education His father, Ajoy Roy, was a professor of physics at University of Dhaka who received the Ekushey Padak award. Avijit earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from BUET. He earned a master's and doctoral degree in Biomedical Engineering from National University of Singapore. Career In 2006, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia and worked as a software engineer. Roy published eight books in Bengali. =Mukto-Mona= Roy was the founder of the Bangladeshi Mukto-Mona (freethinkers) website which was one of the nominees of The Bobs (Best of Blogs) Award in the Best of Online Activism category. The site published death threats that author Humayun Azad had received before he was assassinated. Mukto-Mona began as a Yahoo group in May 2001, but became a website in 2002. Roy described his writing as \\"taboo\\" in Bangladesh. He had received death threats from fundamentalist bloggers for his articles and books. Rokomari.com, a Bangladeshi e-commerce site, stopped selling Roy's books after its owner received death threats from Islamists. =Protests and advocacy= A Bangladeshi group, Blogger and Online Activist Network (BOAN), initiated the 2013 Shahbag protests that sought capital punishment for the Islamist leader and war criminal Abdul Quader Molla as well as the removal of Jamaat-e-Islami from politics. Islamist groups responded by organising protests calling for the execution of \\"atheist bloggers\\" accused of insulting Islam, and the introduction of a blasphemy law. Many atheist bloggers who supported the Shahbag protests came under attack, and Ahmed Rajib Haider was killed by Islamist groups on 15 February 2013. A month before the protest, blogger Asif Mohiuddin was attacked outside his house by four youths influenced by Anwar Al-Awlaki, and Sunnyur Rahman, known as Nastik Nobi (Atheist Prophet), was stabbed on 7 March 2013. Asif Mohiuddin, a winner of the BOBs award for online activism, was on an Islamist hit list that also included the murdered sociology professor Shafiul Islam. Mohiuddin's blog was shut down by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, and he was jailed for posting \\"offensive comments about Islam and Mohammed.\\" The secular government arrested several other bloggers and blocked about a dozen websites and blogs, as well as giving police protection to some bloggers. International organisations, including Human Rights Watch, \\"the government is abandoning any serious claim that it is committed to free speech\\", said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.\\" Amnesty International, Reporters without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the imprisonment of bloggers and the climate of fear for journalists. Avijit Roy wrote that he was disgusted that the Bangladeshi media portrayed young bloggers as \\"crooks in the public eye\\" and wrote to Western media outlets and the Center for Inquiry and the International Humanist and Ethical Union for support. Roy went on to coordinate international protests in Dhaka, New York City, Washington, D.C., London, Ottawa and other cities in support of the jailed bloggers. He was joined by writers, activists, and prominent secularists and intellectuals around the world including Salman Rushdie, Taslima Nasrin, Hemant Mehta, Maryam Namazie, PZ Myers, Anu Muhammad, Ajoy Roy, Qayyum Chowdhury, Ramendu Majumdar and Muhammad Zafar Iqbal in publicly expressing their solidarity with the arrested bloggers. Murder In 2015, Roy went to Dhaka with his wife Bonya during the Ekushey Book Fair. On the evening of 26 February, he and Bonya were returning home from the fair by bicycle rickshaw. At around 8:30 pm, they were attacked near the Teacher Student Center intersection of Dhaka University by unidentified assailants. Two assailants stopped and dragged them from the rickshaw to the pavement before striking them with machetes, according to witnesses. Roy was struck and stabbed with sharp weapons in the head. His wife was slashed on her shoulders and the fingers of her left hand were severed. Both of them were rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where Roy was pronounced dead around 10:30 pm. Bonya survived. In an interview with BBC's Newshour, she said that police stood nearby when they were attacked on the spot but did not act. In a Twitter post on the day after his death, an Islamist group, calling itself Ansar Bangla-7, claimed responsibility for the killing. Ansar Bangla-7 is said to be the same organization as Ansarullah Bangla Team. A case of murder was filed by Roy's father without naming any suspects at Shahbagh thana on 27 February 2015. According to police sources, they are investigating a local Islamist group that praised the killing. Avijit's body was placed at Aparajeyo Bangla in front of the Faculty of Arts building (Kala Bhavan) at Dhaka University on 1 March 2015 where people from all walks of life, including his friends, relatives, well-wishers, teachers and students, gathered with flowers to pay their respect to the writer. As per Roy's wish, his body was handed over to Dhaka Medical College for medical research. On 6 March 2015, a four-member team of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) along with detective branch of Bangladesh Police inspected the spot where Roy was killed. The FBI members collected evidence from the site and took footage to help in the investigation. 3 May 2015, the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) claimed responsibility for the murder of Roy and the deaths of other \\"blasphemers\\" in Bangladesh in a report published by SITE intelligence group. =Arrests= On 2 March 2015, Rapid Action Battalion arrested Farabi Shafiur Rahman, a radical Islamist. It was suspected by the police that Farabi had shared Roy's location, identity, family photographs, etc. with the killer(s). Farabi had threatened Roy several times through blogs and social media sites including Facebook. He said on different posts and comments that Roy would be killed upon his arrival in Dhaka. Bangladesh's government decided to seek help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the murder of Roy. The decision was taken following an offer by the United States. On 18 August 2015, three members of Ansarullah Bangla Team, including a British citizen, named Touhidur Rahman who police described as \\"the main planner of the attacks on Avijit Roy and Ananta Bijoy Das\\", had been arrested in connection with the two murders. =Reactions= After the death of Roy, students, teachers, bloggers and intellectuals around the country gathered at Dhaka University, demanding quick arrest of the killers. The Mukto-Mona website bore the message in Bengali \\"We are grieving but we shall overcome\\" against a black background. Secretary-General of the United Nations spokesperson St√©phane Dujarric condemned the killing and said \\"On the attack of the blogger, we spoke to our human rights colleagues who obviously condemned the attack and expressed the hope that the perpetrators will be quickly brought to justice through the due process of law.\\" The head of Reporters without Borders Asia-Pacific stated \\"We are shocked by this act of barbarity\\" and added \\"It is unacceptable for [police] to spend so much time searching news outlets, arresting journalists, censoring news and investigating bloggers, when the many attacks on bloggers are still unpunished.\\" The CEO of Index on Censorship, Jodie Ginsberg, said: \\"Our sympathies are with the family of Avijit Roy. Roy was targeted simply for expressing his own beliefs and we are appalled by his death and condemn all such killings.\\" The Asia Program Coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists stated \\"This attack is emblematic of the culture of impunity that pervades Bangladesh, where the lack of accountability in previous attacks on the press continues to spurn [sic] a deadly cycle of violence.\\" Humanist groups expressed horror at the loss of a colleague. The Center for Inquiry's chief UN representative stated \\"Avijit was brilliant, yes, and a devoted advocate of free expression and secularism, but also just a very good person.\\" Andrew Copson of the British Humanist Association, which awarded Roy and other bloggers the Free Expression Award in 2014, said \\"With Avijit‚Äôs death, Bangladesh has lost not just a son, but a forceful proponent of human rights and equality for all its people.\\" The British High Commissioner Robert Gibson expressed his concern in a tweet saying, \\"Shocked by the savage murder of Avijit Roy as I am by all the violence that has taken place in Bangladesh in recent months\\".

Sever is an American herpetologist, histologist, anatomist and reproductive biologist. He has been a professor and department head in the Department of Biological Sciences at Southeastern Louisiana University since 2004, and held the Kenneth Dyson Endowed Professorship in Biological Sciences from 2012 to 2015. He is well known for over 30 years of research on the secondary sexual characteristics of salamanders and more generally on comparative histoanatomy of the urogenital systems of vertebrates. and was recognized as the 2013 Distinguished Herpetologist of the Year by the Herpetologists' League. Early life A native of Canton, Ohio, Sever was interested in dinosaurs at an early age, but, \\"You couldn't find dinosaurs, but you could find lizards and turtles, things that looked like dinosaurs.\\" His early exposure to herpetology came from the Boy Scouts, and he is an Eagle Scout. Academic career Sever earned his Ph.D. from Tulane University in 1974 where he studied the secondary sexual characters of plethodontid salamanders under Harold A. Dundee.Adler, Kraig, ed. (2012). Contributions to the History of Herpetology. Volume 3. Vancouver, British Columbia: Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles. . He worked at his first academic post at Saint Mary's College (Indiana) from 1974 to 2004, serving as chair from 1980 to 1989. He has been the Department Head of Biological Sciences at Southeastern Louisiana University since 2004. Research Stanley E. Trauth, in his capacity as president of the Herpetologist's League, stated that Sever's research contributions were why he was chosen. \\"Early in his studies, Dave's histological research focused primarily on salamander cloacal anatomy and, specifically, the spermatheca or sperm storage structure in these animals,\\" said Trauth. \\"His numerous papers on these structures have dominated the international literature on this subject for decades,\\" and \\"I consider Dave to be today's world leading authority on vertebrate reproductive histology\\". \\"He is without question the foremost histo-herpetologist that has ever lived.\\" Sever discovered and described the plethodontid Junaluska salamander (Eurycea junaluska), which lives in the southern Appalachian Mountains.

Biography Born in 1962 in Moscow, Sharapova completed studies at the Film Institute and at the Literature Institute. After working as a shorthand typist, she became an animal keeper and stage assistant for circus performances. Sharapova's radio play Circus Train, based on her work in a circus, has been broadcast by the BBC. It tells the story of what happens after two circus performers and their huge dog are abandoned by their touring train, bringing them into contact with several eccentric travellers. Several of her other works depict the hardships of Moscow's gay scene made up of broken lives and jealousy between members of the gay community rather than any pressure from the authorities. The extent of violence is clearly brought out in her 2004 novel Moscow, the Station of Lesbos in which the rich, domineering Anastasia kills the 22-year-old drug addict Lucinda for making passes at her lover Masha. Sharapova has received a number of literary awards and is a member of the Moscow Union of Writers. As a result of the oppression she had suffered from the authorities in Moscow, in 2013 Sharapova sought political asylum in Portugal. \\"LGBT literature has no future in Russia,\\" she explained. \\"When I told the government officials I wrote my stories before the gay propaganda law came into force, they replied 'You wrote before and will answer for it now.

On prominent automotive figures, Cumberford described Alec Issigonis, who received a knighthood \\"in recognition of his engineering genius,\\" as \\"not terribly innovative in a mechanical sense.\\" He wrote in 2004 that intensely controversial car designer Chris Bangle is \\"a man with the courage of his convictions and of solid character, and he is worthy of our admiration for that alone.\\" Noted automotive cartoonist Stan Mott described Cumberford as \\"an intellectual automotive enthusiast.\\" Automobile editor Jean Lindamood Jennings said Cumberford \\"is highly opinionated, as every working car designer in the world today knows, sometimes painfully,\\" adding that his design reviews have become \\"wildly popular.\\" At the 2013 LA Auto Show, Jennings said Cumberford \\"tends toward a certain cantankerous crustyness just shy of curmudgeonly.\\" Cumberford won the 2013 Best Article of the Year Award from the Motor Press Guild for his article, \\"GM's Road Not Taken\\" about the LaSalle II Roadster, published in Automobile magazine in March 2013. Background Cumberford grew up in Southern California, the son of a Texas-born housewife and a Scotsman from Chile who worked for L.A.'s streetcar company, the Los Angeles Railway. He began sketching cars at age 15 and developed a strong interest in aircraft design as child, later saying that he preferred aircraft design to automobile design. He had wanted to study aeronautical engineering on scholarship at Caltech but attended instead the Art Center of Pasadena, then known as the Art Center School, working in a grocery store and cleaning the classroom floors to help pay tuition. Career Cumberford eventually dropped out of school, but inadvertently started a writing career when a rendering of a pogo stick he'd designed in the style of a Jaguar was shown to John Bond, editor of Road & Track ‚Äì and Cumberford was invited to write a review to go with the rendering. He had already designed two automobiles, the Parkinson Jaguar Special and the Ken Miles Flying Shingle. In 1954 at age eighteen, his race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published. At age 19, Cumberford sent 118 renderings personally to GM's Harley J. Earl, who hired him as a professional car designer. At GM, he worked on six models of the Chevrolet Corvette including the 1956-57 four- headlamp facelift model as well as the 1955 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham and 1957 Buick Special. At GM Cumberford also worked the company's layout standards for instruments and controls. And at GM he purchased his first car, a Volkswagen Beetle, moving soon to a Porsche 356. Leaving GM, Cumberford studied philosophy for one year at UCLA, drove across Mexico and then the United States in a VW Microbus, subsequently moving to Mexico and working as a freelance design consultant to various industries. In 1959, he was design assistant to noted automotive and industrial designer Albrecht Goetz. In 1962 and 63, Cumberford was chief designer with the racing team Holman Moody. In the early 1960s, Cumberford would also have a series of satirical renderings along with a fictional story published in Motor Trend featuring his and childhood friend Stand Mott's work ‚Äì forecasting possible designs for the much discussed forthcoming \\"small Chevrolet,\\" what would become the Corvair. 1967 Italia by Intermeccanica - exterior design by Robert Cumberford He has lived in France, Mexico, and Switzerland ‚Äì and has designed automobiles (including the Saab 850 and Renault Arquitectonicaro) race cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, and hovercraft with his companies Cumberford Design International (with offices in New York, Mexico City and Northampton England) and Cumberford Creative ‚Äì working in the suburbs of Paris from 1996 to 1999 on projects for Renault and Citro√´n. In 1986 Cumberford began contributing to the then new Automobile magazine at the request of editor David E. Davis, joining the magazine in its sixth issue with his column By Design, which was expanded to two full pages in 2006. He was the European Editor for Air Progress, magazine, continues to contribute to Automobile and Design magazine, and is a noted author ‚Äì participating in a wide spectrum of forums, design competitions and events related to the automotive, aeronautical and design industries. Cumberford authored the 2006 book Auto Legends: Classics of Style And Design; the 2001 book Chris Bangle: BMW Global Design and the 2008 book Cars, the latter printed in Italian. He contributed to the 2013 book Automotive Jewelry, Volume One: Mascots, Badges. Cumberford was keynote speaker at \\"The Italian Avantgarde in Car Design\\" as part of the September 2002 exposition on Italian design in New York, and moderated the 2007 Classic Car Forum at the Pebble Beach Concours with Moray Callum, Andrea Zagato, Shiro Nakamura, Ed Welburn, and Ian Callum. He contributed to the catalogue for the North Carolina Museum of Art 2013 show \\"Porsche by Design: Seducing Speed.\\" As a judge, Cumberford participated in the 1988 Automobile Quarterly Car Design Contest; the second annual (2003) World Automotive Design Competition and Design Forum hosted by the Canadian International AutoShow (CIAS); the Best Design School 2003; the 2005 Canadian International AutoShow; and the fourth annual (2005) World Automotive Design Competition. Awards In 2013 Cumberford won the 2013 Best Article of the Year Award from the Motor Press Guild for his article, \\"GM's Road Not Taken\\" about the LaSalle II Roadster, published in Automobile magazine in March 2013. His work in Automobile magazine has won numerous International Automotive Media Awards, including: 2000, (Gold) for his article on Bob Gregorie; 2005, article about the 1935 Stout Scarab; 2007 for his article \\"Best of Show\\"; 2010, for the By Design column (Silver); and 2013 (Gold), for the By Design column. Cumberford Martinique In 1982, with backing from a computer company, Cumberford designed a flamboyant front- engine, rear-drive two-seater of which two examples were crafted as development prototypes ‚Äì with body of cast and sheet aluminum; African Mahogany fenders; a 3.2-liter, in-line, BMW-sourced, six-cylinder engine; as well as steering and suspension components from a Citro√´n CX. Two prototypes were constructed in Stamford, Connecticut, with one displayed in a San Diego museum for a period and another kept in Cumberford's garage in France. With the two-seater appearing on the cover of Car and Driver magazine in April 1982, the intention had been to market as many as 300 of the cars (as the ‚Äì to Cumberford Martinque) but only the prototypes were manufactured ‚Äì with an overall investment of approximately $3.5 million. Funding dried up after John DeLorean was indicted in a completely unrelated automotive scandal. Cumberford later drove one of the Martiniques from Austin, Texas to Pebble Beach, California in 1985, and both still exist today.

In 2010 there were 32,000 baptized. It is currently governed by Archeparch Elie Bechara Haddad, BS. Territory and statistics The archeparchy extends its jurisdiction over the Melkite Greek faithful of Sidon District and Chouf District in Lebanon. Its archeparchial seat is the city of Sidon, where is located the cathedral of Saint Nicholas. The territory is divided into 53 parishes and had 32,000 Melkite Catholics in 2010. History Sidon was the site of an ancient Christian community, dating back to the dawn of Christianity. The historical and Christian origins of Sidon dates back to the New Testament, in the Gospel of Matthew (Mt 15: 21-28) reports: \\"From there, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon\\" and in the Gospel of Mark (Mk 7, 31) states: \\"Jesus left the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee midst of the coasts of Decapolis\\". On the arrest and imprisonment of Paul, in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 27.3): \\"The next day we touched at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul the benevolent, allowed him to go to his friends and to seek care.\\" However, the presence of a bishop is historically attested for the first time at the First Council of Nicaea of 325. In Roman crusade was the seat of a diocese of the Latin Rite. Only from 770 was recovered the life of the Sidon Christian community. With the conquest of the last Crusader bastion in Acre by the Mamelukes in 1291, the Christian community in Sidon largely was vanished from there. The reconstruction of the Christian communities in and around Sidon began again until 1604 with the election of Ignatius Houtiyeh as bishop of Tyre and Sidon. During the Catholic missionary work since the end of the 16th century some individual Melkite Orthodox priests were converted to the Latin rite. They converted to the Catholic faith Euthymius II Karmah (died in 1635) whom was ordained in 1634 Melkite Patriarch of Antioch united with Catholic Church. The Eparchy of Sidon started in 1683 with its Melkite bishops in communion with Rome. First Catholic eparch was Efthymios Sa√Øfi, founder of Basilian Salvatorian Order. Initially it was united with the archeparchy of Tyre; the two locations were separated in the mid-eighteenth century (in 1752 approximately). Tyre became an archeparchy and Sidon an eparchy. On 18 November 1964 the eparchy was elevated to the rank of archeparchy by Pope Paul VI. On 27 January 2007, the pope gave his assent to the Elie Haddad's election, canonically made by the Synod of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church on 11 October 2006, to Archbishop of Sidon to the Melkites.[Bollettino sala stampa della Santa Sede, 27 gennaio 2007: Assenso del Santo Padre all'elezione dell'arcivescovo di Sa√Øda (Libano) dei Greco-Melkiti] Bishops * Euthymios Michael Saifi (1683 - October 8, 1723 deceased) * Ignatius El Beyrouthy (1724 - 1752 resigned) * Basilios Jelghaf (1755 - July 23, 1764 appointed prefect of Beirut) * Michel Jawhar, BS (1764 - March 30, 1789 confirmed Melkite Patriarch of Antioch) * Vacant (1789-1795) * Agapius II Matar, BS (1795 - July 24, 1797 confirmed Melkite Patriarch of Antioch) * Gabriel Matar, BS (1800 - August 14, 1813 elected Melkite Patriarch of Antioch) * Vacant (1813-1822) * Helias (Basilios) Khalil (2 February 1822 consecrated - 1836 deceased) * Theodosius Kuyumji (20 December 1836 consecrated - 1886 deceased) * Basil Haggiar, BS (June 16, 1887 - February 16, 1916 deceased) * Athanasius Khoriaty, BS (March 14, 1920 - January 24, 1931 deceased) * Gabriel (Nicholas) Nabaa, BS (November 22, 1931 - December 15, 1946 deceased) =Archbishops= * Basile Khoury (March 15, 1947 - August 25, 1977 withdrawn) * Michel Hakim, BS (August 25, 1977 - October 13, 1980 appointed Apostolic Exarch of Canada) * Ignace Raad (September 9, 1981 - September 18, 1985 resigned) * Georges Kwa√Øter, BS (23 July 1987 - 2006 withdrawn) * Elie Bechara Haddad, BS (from 11 October 2006) References External links * http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsdme.html * http://www.notredamedemantara.org/french/index.htm * http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13776a.htm * http://www.pgc- lb.org/fre/melkite_greek_catholic_church/Archieparchie-de-Saida-et-Deir-el- Kamar-Liban Category:Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Lebanon Category:Melkite Greek Catholic eparchies Category:Sidon District ","title":"Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Sidon"},{"id":"45516562","text":"Isla San Mart√≠n is an island in the Pacific Ocean west of the Baja California Peninsula.

Biography Zaharija was born around 1760 in the village of Vince, near Kumanovo in modern-day North Macedonia. In order to get education, he went to school of the Serbian Orthodox Monastery of Deƒçani in the region of Metohija. He was noticed as bright and pious by archimandrite Danilo Ka≈æanegra. He joined the Monastery and later went with his archimandrite on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1794 (hence he was called had≈æi- Zaharije, from Turkish hacƒ±, \\"pilgrim\\"). After the death of archimandrite Danilo, he became the next archimandrite of Deƒçani. In that time, Monastery of Deƒçani was one the most important monasteries in Eparchy of Ra≈°ka and Prizren, so after the death of Metropolitan Joanikije (Janiƒáije) of Ra≈°ka and Prizren in 1818, the local Serbs insisted that Zaharija would succeed him. After Mahmud-pasha Rotuloviƒá of Prizren, a local plenipotentiary, agreed to it and Zaharija was sent to Constantinople to be consecrated. His work as Metropolitan of Ra≈°ka and Prizren came in troublesome times. During the Greek Uprising (1821) several monks of Visoki Deƒçani were hanged while Zaharija was imprisoned for almost a year. He died in on March 15, 1830 and was buried in Visoki Deƒçani monastery.

As the goddess of chastity, rain and fertilization, she is well praised by the Malayalis and the two main ethnicities of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan Tamil Saivites and also by the Sinhalese Buddhists as Pattini Deviyo.  The plaintive Life of a Woman turned goddess  Silapathikaram, the literary work of Ilango Adigal describes the poor life of Kannaki with her husband merchant Kovalan, who lost his all wealth during his life with a lavish courtesan dancer called Madhavi and travelled to Madurai to start a new life. While kovalan selling anklets of Kannaki for money in Madurai, he was misunderstood as the thief of Pandya queen's anklet and beheaded by King's order without any inquiries. Kannaki became furious and advocates at the court of the King and by breaking the anklets, she proves that anklet seized from Kovalan is hers. Pandya King shocked and died while Kannaki took an oath to express her chastity by burning the City, Madurai. Then, She wanders towards west and at Neduvel Kunram, She became a celestial goddess. Kodungallur Bhagavathy Amman Kannaki Cult at Tamil Nadu Silappatikaram and its sequel Tamil epic Manimekalai have the evidences that Kannaki was praised as goddess even during the lifetime of Manimekalai, the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi. Silappatikaram tells about the Kannaki worship of another Pandyan King \\"Vetrivel Cheliyan\\" for relieving from drought and curse of her on Pandya Nadu.Silappatikaram, Vanji Kantam Kannaki was mainly praised for rain, and became the goddess of Mari or Rain and got the name \\"Mari Amman\\".T. Madhava Menon(2000), \\"A Handbook of Kerala\\" p.229 Silappatikaram confirms Mari Amman is none other than Kannaki by stating that Kannaki burnt Madurai in Friday of Aadi month.Silappatikaram, Katturai Kaathai, Line 133-136 which month is celebrated as the \\"month of Mari Amman\\" in Tamil Nadu. However Vattapparai Amman at Thiruvottiyur still commemorate as Kannaki Amman. Siruvachur Mathura Kaliyamman temple, Mangala Devi Kovil in Idukki District are the other few temples where their connection with Kannaki still remembered. Kannaki Cult at Kerala Kannaki cult, perhaps initiated by the rulers of Chera lineage in Kerala, is still preserved in the form of Bhagavati cult.Bertold Spuler (1975) \\"Handbook of Oriental Studies, Part 2\\" p.111 The famous Bhagavati Temple at Kodungallur which was the former capital of Cheras remembers its ancient interaction with Kannaki cult in its Sthala Puranam.The Illustrated Weekly of India, Volume 111, Issues 13-25 p.33Chummar Choondal (1980) \\"Kerala Folk Literature\\", p.37 Though the deity of the temple is still observed as Bhadra Kali, she is often praised by the devotees as Kannaki and Muthumari in Kodungallur. Attukal Bhagavati Temple, Moothanthara Karnaki Amman Temple and so many Bhagavathy temples are believed to be located on the journey of Kannaki to Chera Nadu after the burning of Madurai.Biju Mathew (2013)Pilgrimage to Temple Heritage pp.50,51,62,292 Amman Idol at Thambiluvil Sri Kannaki amman temple Kannaki cult of Sri Lankan Tamils Sri Lankan beliefs on Kannaki are intermediate to Silappatikaram and common Sri Lankan Beliefs. Eastern Sri Lankan and Vanni Tamils praises her as \\"Kannakai Amman\\". There are so many evidences in Yalpana Vaipava Malai, chronicle of Jaffna Kingdom confirms that Kannaki cult was also popular in the period of Arya Chakravarthis (1215‚Äì1624) in Northern Sri Lanka. The author of Sri Lankan epic on Kannaki equivalent to Silappatikaram, \\"Kannaki Vazhakkurai\\" recited in Eastern Kannaki Amman temples, is believed to be written by one of the Aryachakravartis Jeyaveeran (1380 ‚Äì 1410CE). The Kannagi cult was especially popular among the coastal folk who consider her as their guardian deity since she was the daughter of a rich sea-trader of Kaveripattinam. Since most of the coastal folk were converted to Catholicism during the Portuguese rule, became most of the Kannaki shrines converted to churches of Our Lady. The remaining temples of Kannaki were transformed into Agamic Raja Rajeshwari and Bhuvaneshvari Temples as Kannaki was considered as a ln incarnation of Shakti by the activists of Saiva movement of 19th Century in Jaffna in the leadership of Navalar.\\"The journal of Asian studies - Volume 49, Issues 1-2\\" (1990)p.88 Kannaki is mainly praised once in a year during the Vaikasi month (May‚ÄìJune) of Tamil Calendar in Batticaloa and Ampara Districts. The Festival is called as \\"Cadangu\\", \\"Kathavu Thiraththal\\" and so on. Kalyanak Kaal Naduthal (Planting Wedding Pillar), Vazhakkurai Paaduthal (Reciting the verses of \\"Kannaki Vazhakkurai\\"), Kulirthi Paaduthal (\\"Singing Cooling verses\\") are the common rituals observed in these days. The festival days are differing temple to temple from three days to seven days. In the end of Festival the sanctum of Kannaki temple is closed and it will be only opened before starting next year \\"Cadangu\\". Kannaki Cult of Sinhalese Pattini Deviyo Although the hierophant of Kannaki is fully transformed into Bhagavathy Cult and Mariamman Cult at Kerala and Tamil Nadu respectively, Sri Lanka Still preserves the Kannaki Cult in its own form. Sinhalese praises her as \\"Pattini Deviyo\\" (The chast one goddess). Their folks on that goddess also differ from Silappatikaram and see her as an avatar of Bodhisattva.Richard Francis Gombrich, Richard Gombrich, Gananath Obeyesekere (1988) \\"Buddhism Transformed: Religious Change in Sri Lanka\\" pp.30,31 She was born as a mango in the garden of Pandi King and neglected by him and kept in a boat to sea and grows up at Choli country and at last, she fulfilled her purpose - killing the evil Pandi KingGananath Obeyesekere (1990) \\"The Work of Culture: Symbolic Transformation in Psychoanalysis and Anthropology\\" p.28,46,129 and hired as one of the guardian gods of Lanka by Lord Buddha. The grant Festival of Sri Lanka - \\"Kandy Perahera\\" was initially started for hailing only the Hindu gods Kannaki, Vishnu, Kataragama along with Natha. The holy tooth relic of Lord Buddha was annexed in the procession during the period of Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy Kingdom.

Administratively, they belong to Istiaia-Aidipsos municipality, in Euboea regional unit. Description The complex consists of seven islands and islets. The biggest of them is Manolia and is the only that had residents in the past. The other six are Strongyli, Mikri Strongyli, Steno, Vagia, Vorias and Limani. The biggest island, Manolia has a beautiful beach and is visited by many tourists in the summer. In the past had a small settlement but nowadays is forsaken. Strongyli is the second largest island and on top has a big lighthouse. History Lichades were formed after the huge earthquake of 426 B.C., when the land between them sank in the Euboean Sea. According to Greek mythology, their name comes from Lichas, the servant of Hercules who brought the poisoned shirt from Deianira to Hercules. Hercules hurled him to the sea and from his parts these small islands were formed.

He was best known for his landscapes and colorful depictions of Estonian peasants. Biography His father was a master baker and his mother's family was involved in the performing arts.Anne Untera, \\"Oskar Hoffmann looming ja elu\\" from Kultuur ja Elu, 2002 For a few years, he worked in a lithography and photography studio, which is where he first displayed his aptitude for painting. Many of his later works appear to be based on photographs taken during this period, especially the watercolor portraits.Juta Kivim√§e, \\"Ajalehte lugev mees\\" (Man Reading a Newspaper), from Sirp, 2002 He soon began exhibiting at the local art society and, in 1872, went to Germany, where he enrolled at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. In 1874, he briefly worked in the studios of Eduard von Gebhardt. His next professor was a fellow Baltic-German from Estonia, Eugen D√ºcker. His primary influences, however, probably came from Gregor von Bochmann, who was only one year older, but had begun his studies in D√ºsseldorf at the age of eighteen. They also became lifelong friends. He graduated from the Academy in 1877 and made a visit to Paris, where he worked with Fernand Cormon. The following year, he established his own studio in D√ºsseldorf and learned etching. In the early 1880s, he briefly returned to Dorpat then, possibly in debt, went to Saint Petersburg where, in 1884, he was granted the status of \\"Free Artist\\" by the Imperial Academy of Arts. @ the Baltisches Biographisches Lexikon While there, he continued to participate in international exhibitions in Vienna, Berlin and elsewhere.

The first massacre took place on 11 March 1793, in the provincial city of Machecoul, in the district of the lower Loire. The city was a thriving center of grain trade; most of the victims were administrators, merchants and citizens of the city. Although the Machecoul massacre, and others that followed it, are often viewed (variously) as a royalist revolt, or a counter- revolution, twenty-first century historians generally agree that Vendee revolt was a complicated popular event brought on by anti-clericalism of the Revolution, mass conscription, and Jacobin anti-federalism. In the geographic area south of the Loire, resistance to recruitment was particularly intense, and much of this area also resented intrusion by partisans of the republic, called \\"blue coats\\", who brought with them new ideas about district and judicial organization, and who required reorganization of parishes with the so-called juring priests (those who had taken the civil oath). Consequently, the insurgency became a combination of many impulses, at which conscription and the organization of parishes led the list. The response to it was incredibly violent on both sides. Background In 1791, two representatives on mission informed the National Convention of the disquieting condition of Vend√©e, and this news was quickly followed by the exposure of a royalist plot organized by the Marquis de la Rou√´rie. It was not until the social unrest combined with the external pressures from the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) and the introduction of a levy of 300,000 on the whole of France, decreed by the National Convention in February 1793, that the region erupted.James Maxwell Anderson (2007). Daily Life During the French Revolution, Greenwood Publishing Group, . p. 205.Fran√ßois Furet. The French Revolution, 1770‚Äì1814, Blackwell Publishing, France, 1996. . p. 124. The Civil Constitution of the Clergy required all clerics to swear allegiance to it and, by extension, to the increasingly anti-clerical National Constituent Assembly. All but seven of the 160 French bishops refused the oath, as did about half of the parish priests.Anthony James Joes, Resisting Rebellion: The History and Politics of Counterinsurgency, Lexington, University Press of Kentucky, 2006 . p.51. Persecution of the clergy and of the faithful was the first trigger of the rebellion. Those who refused the oath, called non-juring priests, had been exiled or imprisoned. Women on their way to Mass were beaten in the streets. Religious orders had been suppressed and Church property, confiscated. On 3 March 1793, most of the churches were ordered closed. Soldiers confiscated sacramental vessels and the people were forbidden to place crosses on graves.Joes, p.52. Nearly all the purchasers of church land were bourgeois; very few peasants benefited from the sales.Charles Tilly, \\"Local Conflicts in the Vend√©e before the rebellion of 1793\\", _French Historical Studies_ II, Fall 1961, p. 219. To add to this insult, on 23 February 1793 the Convention required the raising of an additional 300,000 troops from the provinces, an act which enraged the populace, who took up arms instead as The Catholic Army; the term \\"Royal\\" was added later. This army fought first and foremost for the reopening of parish churches with the former priests.Joes, pp. 52-53. In March 1793, as word of the conscription requirements filtered into the countryside, many Vend√©ans refused to satisfy the decree of the levee en masse issued on 23 February 1793. Within weeks the rebel forces had formed a substantial, if ill- equipped, army, the Royal and Catholic Army, supported by two thousand irregular cavalry and a few captured artillery pieces. Most of the insurgents operated on a much smaller scale, using guerrilla tactics, supported by the local knowledge and the good-will of the people.Jonathan North, General Hoche and Counterinsurgency The Journal of Military History, 67.2 (2003), pp. 529-540\\\\. Massacre Ruins of the Ch√¢teau de Machecoul where most of the killings occurred. The irregular army raised in the countryside had not reached Machecoul, but the officials from the conscription officers had. On Monday, 11 March 1793, a crowd arrived in the center of the town, from the surrounding countryside; they started the chant Pas de milice (no enlistments) and surrounded the Republic's conscription officers in the town. A nervous soldier opened fire and the enraged crowd retaliated. Between 22 and 26 soldiers were killed, including their lieutenant, Pierre-Claude Ferr√©.David Andress, The French Revolution and the People, London, New York, NY, Hambledon and London, 2004, p. 194 and Graeme Fife, The Terror: the shadow of the guillotine, France, 1792-1794, New York : St. Martin's Press, 2006. , pp. 108‚Äì109. The immediate victims also included the juring priest, Pierre Letort, who was bayoneted to death and whose body was mutilated,Andress, p. 194. Pagnot the magistrate, and √âtienne Gaschignard, the principal of the college. The National Guard was routed, and the rebels, including many women, seized those they called \\"patriots\\" --also called the \\"Blues\\", or the people who supported the republican cause--and led them to prison in the old castle and the convent of Sisters of Cavalry. There they killed the guardsmen and some notable inhabitants, about 20 in total, although according to some testimony, as many as 26 were killed on the first day and 18 the next day. Alfred Lalli√©, another witness, gave 22 as the count of dead. The situation then spiraled out of control. In the following days, the insurgents swelled to some six thousand men and women, and some of the republican adherents and their families fled to Nantes and other strongholds. On 19 March, many counter-revolutionary suspects were rounded up and the republicans inflicted their own massacres: in La Rochelle, six non-juring priests were hacked to death and their heads (and other body parts) shown throughout the city. About a week later, the insurgents from Machecoul seized the neighboring harbor town of Pornic (approximately to the northwest) on 23 March, this time joined by some of the irregular army that had been forming elsewhere, and sacked it. A republican patrol surprised the Vendeans, who were carousing on liberated cellars, and killed between 200 and 500 of them. The angry peasants returned to Machecoul and in reprisal killed another dozen prisoners on 27 March.Fife, p. 109. In total, about 200 died (not all in the battle), and when the survivors of Pornic returned to Machecoul, they pulled the detained \\"blue coats\\" out of the prisoner and shot them, a process that lasted over the next few weeks, into mid-April.Andress, p. 195. Sisters of Calvary abbey where some of the prisoners were taken. Tales of brutality, some of which may have been true, abounded; numbers of those killed escalated. Current research suggests that 150 were executed in the town overall, but contemporary republican reports put the figure at 500. Despite the demonization of the insurgents, though, twenty- two \\"blue coats\\" from the parish were saved by the request of their own neighborhoods; others were even cleared by tribunals established to monitor executions, and overseen by the local jurist, Ren√© Fran√ßois Souchu. Souchu, a lawyer and judge by profession, directed the execution of approximately 50 republican officials and adherents on 3 April; they were shot down and buried in a field outside of the city.Henry Morse Stephens, A History of the French Revolution, Scribner, 1905, p. 261. =Contemporary reports= The most influential of the contemporary reports came from Citizen Boullemer, and was published in over 1000 pamphlets later in the year.Citizen Boullemer, of Machecoul was a former judge and a crony of the local public prosecutor, Souchu, who escaped the butchery by supporting the insurgency. Boullemer's recitation of the horrors of the massacre at Machecoul by the so-called brigands, reached the Legislature in late 1793. Fife, p. 108. Boullemer claimed to be among the few surviving eyewitnesses: \\"there arrived from all exits of the city, five to six thousand peasants, women and children, armed [with] guns, scythes, knives, shovels and pikes. They shouted, running the streets: peace! peace!\\" Boullemer's account continues: they descended on Machecoul, confronted a detachment of the National guard that had come to enforce the levy. One hundred National Guardsmen and police defended the town against them. Louis-Charles-C√©sar Maupassant, a farmer, merchant and a deputy to the Convention, tried to harangue the attackers into quiescence, but could not be heard above the din. Most of the Republican troops and officials scattered before the threatening crowd. According to Louis Mortimer-Ternaux, another eye-witness, only three officers and five or six gendarmes remained at their posts. At that time, according to him, some national guardsmen who had tried to escape through an alley were ambushed by peasants, pursued, and finally brought down by the crowd at the feet of the deputy, Maupassant. The crowd then pulled him off his horse and killed him with a stroke of a shovel.Fife, p. 108. Boullemer's wrote his sensational account well after the fact, in the safety of Rennes, where he was taken after being rescued by republican forces. Boullemer admitted that he had spent most of the six weeks of the upheaval at Machecoul in the safety of his granary, hiding from the peasants. His account of the terror, though lost nothing in the fact that he had seen little: the peasants in the town sounded the tocsin, he wrote, and others exploded from the surrounding fields. Within a short time the entire affair had become a wholesale massacre of republican troops, the constitutional priest, known radical sympathizers and anyone involved with the municipal administration. Prisoners had their hands tied behind their backs, and were linked with a rope passed under their armpits, in a so-called rosary; then they were dragged into fields and forced to dig their own graves before being gunned down. Patriots, those who supported the revolution, were hunted down, lashed to trees, and emasculated. Patriot women were raped and cut down in orchards. Boullemer placed the count of the dead at 552. View from Paris From the Jacobin clubs, the Convention, and the streets and alleyways in Paris, this could only be viewed as insurrection. For them, the Revolution meant a France indivisible. Anything that divided France--anything that varied from the path set the revolutionary government--was dangerous to the success for the revolution itself. Any idea, an action, or thought that ran counter to the revolutionary ideology smacked of federalism or, worse, of royalist sentiment. The historians' debate over federalism and the French Revolution reaches almost to the days of the Revolution itself. To be called a \\"federalist\\" in 1793, 1794, or 1795, or any other time in the revolution, for that matter, was tantamount to being labeled as an anti-revolutionary; to be called anti-revolutionary meant one was de facto a royalist. It was a convenient epithet: to be called a federalist alienated one from the principal radical goal of the revolution, which was to create a single, unified French Republic. Any notion of sectionalism--the possibility that a department or departments could establish for themselves a set of conditions and a government--must be labeled as anti-revolutionary. For the moderate Girondins and the radical Montagnards, federalism meant the watering-down of the Revolution, the violation of the civic body, and the loss of their dreams. If the peasants of the Vend√©e did not want to fight for the Revolution, if they preferred their priests and their (dead) king to their liberty, then they must be against the Revolution and, consequently, they must be severed from its benefits.For an explanation of federalism and the French Revolution, see Paul R. Hanson, Jacobin Republic Under Fire: The Federalist Revolt in the French Revolution. University Park, Penn State Press, 2003, , particularly Chapter Four, \\"The Federalist Program\\" (pp. 99-122). This uncompromising vision of revolutionary goals implied a plain and brutal truth: \\"convert heads or chop them off.\\"Fife, p. 107. One deputy complained, \\"if there were only 30,000, it would be a simple matter of putting them all to the sword, but there are so many!\\"Jonas, p. 117. Boullemer's written description of the event was published as a pamphlet in November 1793, and the representative on mission, Jacques Garnier, sent a thousand copies to the Convention, the Executive Council and to all departments; it also served as a basis for the official report that Fran√ßois Toussaint Villers presented to the Convention.

Aftermath There were other levy riots across France, when the departments started to draft men into the army in response to the Levy Decree but reaction in the northwest in March was particularly pronounced with large scale rioting verging on insurrection. By early April, in areas north of the Loire, order had been restored by the revolutionary government, but south of the river, in the four departments that became known as the Vend√©e Militaire, there were few troops to control rebels and what had started as rioting quickly took on the form of a full insurrection led by priests and the local nobility.Donald M. G. Sutherland. The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order, Blackwell Publishing France, 2008, . p. 155. Evidence links these events to local dissatisfaction with the reorganization of the church into a government entity. The unrest began half way through Lent; Easter that year occurred on 31 March 1793, and, significantly, the initial violence was directed at the local priest Letort. Letort personified the revolution, and the republican government in Paris by taking the Civil Oath of the Clergy, essentially becoming a puppet of the republicans in Paris, at least in the eyes of the insurgents. The violence followed what Raymond Jonas called a singular pattern of logic: it targeted those who personified the revolution in their function or status: National Guard Lieutenant Ferr√©, such prominent townsmen as Deputy Maupassant, and the constitutional priest Letort.Raymond Anthony Jonas, France and the Cult of the Sacred Heart, University of California Press, 2000, , p. 112. Yet, the local district administrator, the jurist Souchu, was left alone: apparently he was known for his anti-republican sentiments and actually threw his lot in with the insurgents.Souchu was captured in mid-April by republican troops and immediately executed. G√©rard, pp. 134‚Äì136. Apparently, as republican troops approached Machecoul, he donned a red liberty cap and rushed out to greet the army, claiming he had been held against his will. Someone denounced him and he was summarily killed. David Bell, The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It, NY, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014, p. 164. After the furor in Machecoul died down later in the spring, the former pastor at Machecoul, the non-juring priest Fran√ßois Priou, refused to celebrate at the now \\"liberated\\" church because the schismatic constitutional priest had profaned it. Instead, he said the Mass outside on a makeshift altar.Jonas, p. 113. Class differences were not as great in the Vend√©e as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vend√©e, the local nobility seems to have been more permanently in residence and not so resented as in other parts of France.Simon Schama, Citizens, Penguin Books, 2004, , p. 589. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vend√©e. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.

The book argues that changes in technology are encroaching on privacy and could create a society in the future with radically different privacy standards. Packard criticized advertisers' unfettered use of private information to create marketing schemes. He compared a recent Great Society initiative by then- president Lyndon B. Johnson, the National Data Bank, to the use of information by advertisers and argued for increased data privacy measures to ensure that information did not find its way into the wrong hands. The essay led Congress to create the Special Subcommittee on the Invasion of Privacy and inspired privacy advocates such Neil Gallagher and Sam Ervin to fight Johnson's flagrant disregard for consumer privacy. Ervin criticized Johnson's invasive domestic agenda and saw the unfiltered database of consumers' information as a sign of presidential abuse of power. Ervin warned that ‚Äúthe computer never forgets‚Äù. Summary It was the first book to raise the question of how technological change is making observation of individuals lives, tastes, opinions and actions easier to observe and monitor. It argues that privacy is worth defending. The technologies of concern at the time of publication were such things as hidden microphones, concealed cameras, and the polygraph lie detector. The likely snoopers were seen as the state, big business, and education.. One reviewer summarized the book by saying that it \\"is concerned with all the peeping tomfoolery which is going on today and the various ways in which we are exposed and thereby victimized.\\" References Category:1964 non-fiction books Category:Works about privacy Category:Privacy activists Category:Activism Category:Privacy Category:Lyndon B.

It was built in 1842 for Colonel Ebenezer Walters. The single story house is built in the Greek Revival style with Doric pilasters at the entrance way. Two auxiliary buildings, constructed at about the same time as the main building, were moved and attached to the rear of the house in 1891. The house is significant as one of the few remaining antebellum era landmarks in Little Rock. It served as the home of pre-Civil war Arkansas Supreme Court Justice George Watkins. Jacob Frolich purchased the home after the war, who would become a post- reconstruction Arkansas Secretary of State. Before that, however, Frolich, an opponent of the reconstruction Arkansas government and fearful of reprisals, fortified Curran Hall with trap doors and placed his livestock inside the house at night. Frolich was indicted for the murder of a reputed informant for the reconstruction government and fled to Canada, but later returned and was acquitted of the charge. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It was acquired by the City of Little Rock and the Little Rock Advertising and Promotion Commission in 1996, renovated, and opened as an information center in 2002.

Microlife is currently the world's largest manufacturer of digital medical thermometers and a major provider of electronic blood pressure monitoring devices. The company maintains international divisions throughout the world. History Afib detection.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BP_B6_Connect_blood_pressure_monitor.png Microlife was founded in Taipei, Taiwan in 1981. It was known as the \\"Micro Idea Instruments Co.\\" upon its founding. Its first product was a digital medical thermometer and, in 1985. The company added blood pressure monitors to their product lines in 1995. A branch office was opened in Switzerland in 1996, and the first office in the United States was opened the following year. In 2002, Microlife acquired Maine-based Biddeford Blankets. Four years later, it acquired the Golden, Colorado-based medical diagnostic equipment manufacturer, HealtheTech. That same year, Microlife was awarded the Frost & Sullivan Award for Product Differentiation Innovation. In 2007, Microlife was one of numerous medical companies to be included in Microsoft's HealthVault. In 2009, the company became the first medical diagnostics manufacturer to produce a blood pressure monitor that detected both hypertension and atrial fibrillation (both of which are warning signs for stroke). the firm entered into a partnership with PharmaSmart in 2012 in an effort to expand their reach in the United States In 2013, the firm received the Red Dot Design Award for its A6PC blood pressure monitor with stroke detection, . and the award for Competitive Strategy Innovation and Leadership from Frost & Sullivan. In 2015, it won a German design award .In 2018, Microlife received the Red Dot Design Award for its NC200 infrared thermometer. The company teamed up with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a cost-effective blood pressure monitoring device (Microlife CRADLE VSA) designed for use in low- and middle- income countries. It has been used in countries like Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. Products Microlife's medical devices are approved for hospital use and guarantee the highest level of safety. In addition to blood pressure management devices, the company also makes devices for fever management, asthma management, flexible heating, weight management and blood glucose management. Technology Microlife's blood pressure monitors and the technologies they house have been the subject of numerous studies and have been validated for both clinical and home use. One of Microlife's technologies is the atrial fibrillation detection incorporated into their blood pressure monitors. Their WatchBP Home A device was recommended by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013. WatchBP Home A was recommended to be used for hypertension monitoring and atrial fibrillation screening in primary care, using the device in primary care could increase the detection rate of atrial fibrillation compared with taking the pulse by hand. Microlife also patented the \\"Microlife Average Mode\\" (MAM), which is a feature in the blood pressure monitors that takes three consecutive readings and creates an average from that data. Pulse arrhythmia detection (PAD), which is another feature in some Microlife blood pressure monitors that automatically detects irregular heartbeats, is another one of the company's primary technologies. Over their lifespan and their different iterations, Microlife blood pressure monitors have been validated by the British Hypertension Society with their highest rating (AA).

It was first described by the American zoologist Mary J. Rathbun and named in honour of the American zoologist Addison Emery Verrill, who spent much time with his students studying the geology and marine fauna of Bermuda. Although this hermit crab species generally inhabits the discarded shell of a free-living gastropod mollusc, it sometimes makes use of the empty, tube-like shells of certain gastropod mollusc species while the tube is permanently cemented to rocks in the reef. Description Like other crabs in the genus Calcinus, C. verrillii has a robust, calcified carapace, eight thoracic segments and six or seven abdominal segments. The carapace and legs are spotted with purple and orange, the eyes have slender eyestalks and the front three pairs of walking legs are smooth and hairless. The soft abdomen is coiled and fits into the mollusc shell which the hermit crab uses for protection, the uropods at the tip of the abdomen gripping the inside of the shell. Distribution and habitat Calcinus verrillii is native to Bermuda and does not occur naturally anywhere else. It is mostly found in the subtidal zone and has been found as deep as 110 metres (630 ft). It is uncommon in intertidal areas and rock pools but is abundant on reefs and rocks with strong water movement. Ecology As a hermit crab, Calcinus verrillii needs to find suitable empty shells of gastropod molluscs in which to live as it grows. It commonly inhabits shells of Cerithium litteratum, but empty shells can sometimes be in short supply. On some occasions the hermit crab takes up abode in the calcified tube of the vermetid gastropod Spiroglyphus irregularis. It also sometimes uses the tubes of the turritelids Vermicularia knorrii and Vermicularia spirata. These tubes are normally attached to rocks, and when this is the case, the hermit crab no longer has freedom of movement to gather fragments of algae off the rock or scavenge for its food. Instead the crab becomes a filter feeder. The advantages to the crab in making use of such a tube-like shell is that it is less likely to be swept off the rocks by strong water movements, and plenty of food may be brought to it by the current. Female C. verrillii grow larger than males, and are more likely to occupy tube shells.

It aired on February 19, 2015, in the U.S. on ABC. Plot Olivia is about to be handed off to the Iranians when she speaks their language and foils the deal. Gus reopens the auction, allowing Huck one more chance to bid on Olivia using Marie's credentials. Meanwhile, Fitz and Cyrus disagree on how to handle the situation, eventually leading Cyrus to plot with the CIA to kill Olivia to prevent international secrets from being leaked. Mellie explains to Fitz that Andrew's blackmail threatens her chance at becoming President herself, and Fitz agrees to let Andrew walk. However, Mellie also plots with Elizabeth to take Andrew down. Olivia is eventually sold to a group in Russia, despite Huck tying for the winning bid. Stephen Finch shows up and rescues Olivia, then brings her back to America, shortly before Andrew has a massive stroke. Fitz goes to Olivia's apartment, but she reveals her disgust at his decision to go to war with West Angola for her, and tells him that she is on her own. Production Henry Ian Cusick returned to the series playing Stephen Finch. The episode was written by Heather Mitchell and directed by Randy Zisk. The episode focuses on the continuing auction of Olivia on the free market and how everyone tries to rescue her. Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained on Twitter that the twelfth and thirteenth episode was one extended episode and was therefore divided into two episodes; Gladiators Don't Run and No More Blood. The episode saw the return of former cast-member Henry Ian Cusick playing the character Stephen Finch, after leaving the show after the first season as the character would be living a normal life with his fianc√© Georgia. Shonda Rhimes explained the return saying ‚ÄúIt was the only sensible solution when you think about Olivia‚Äôs life, where she‚Äôs gone and where she‚Äôs been\\". She further explained that the character was the only one Olivia hadn't abandoned and there was no baggage in their relationship. Darby Stanchfield teased the return of Cusick when interviewed about the storyline of the kidnapping of Olivia, saying ‚ÄúThere is the most freakin‚Äô hugest surprise that happens in the next four episodes that the original Gladiators are going to freak out over.\\" Katie Lowes also mentioned the twist saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real surprise for the original Gladiators, the people who have been here since the beginning.

In the key 18-49 demographic, the episode scored a 3.2/10 in Nielsen ratings, up 10 percent from last year. It was the top TV show in the 9:00 p.m. slot, beating The Blacklist, the series finale of Two and a Half Men, Backstrom and Reign. The 9.62 million people tuned into the episode marked a 2 percent increase from the previous episode (9.32), in addition to the installment's 3.2 Nielsen rating in the target 18‚Äì49 demographic marked a 3 percent increase from 3.1, which was from the previous episode. The Nielsen score additionally registered the show as the week's second-highest rated drama and third-highest rated scripted series in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, only behind Fox's Empire and CBS's The Big Bang Theory.

He was the \\"lord mayor\\" (') of Dresden during the most intensive period of the city's rebuilding, between 1946 and 1958. Life =Early years= Arno Walter Weidauer was born at the tail end of the nineteenth century in Lauter, a small town in the Kingdom of Saxony some 20 km (12 miles) from the German frontier with Bohemia which at that time was still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father worked from home as a weaver of punnets/baskets. He attended school locally and then between 1914 and 1917, undertook an apprenticeship as a carpenter. In 1918, the year of his nineteenth birthday, he was briefly called up for military service. He joined the Workers' Youth Movement in 1916 and in 1919 joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, USPD) which had broken away from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD /)') a couple of years earlier primarily, at that time, because of the mainstream party's continuing support for the war. Like many USPD party members he quit the party after a couple more years, and in 1922 switched to the Communist Party (KPD). =Carpentry, unemployment and politics= Between March 1919 and 1928 worked as a carpenter in Zwickau: there were also periods of unemployment and travel. Along with his membership of the KPD he was part of the local party leadership in Zwickau and also, from 1925 till 1928, a member of the regional party leadership in the nearby Ore Mountains district, a predominantly rural region interspersed with significant areas of commercial mining activity. In addition, between 1924 and 1928 he sat as a local councilor in Zwickau. From July 1928 he took on responsibility for the party's central publications operation on the other side of the country in Essen, a responsibility he retained till 1932. In 1929 Weidauer was elected leader of the Carpentry Trades Union in the Essen district, but he resigned three days later on account of \\"party factionalism\\" which was a feature of left-wing politics in Germany during the 1920s. =Reichstag member= In the general election of July 1932 the Communist Party won 14.3% of the national vote which entitled it to 89 seats in the Reichstag. One of those seats went to Walter Weidauer. In the next election which took place in November of that same year, the share of the votes going to the Communist Party increased a little, to 16.9%, and Weidauer remained a de facto Reichstag member till March 1933. By that time the focus of attention was fixed on the NSDAP (Nazi Party) which had taken power in January 1933 and lost little time in establishing one-Party government in Germany. March 1933 saw the third national Reichstag election in less than a year. In early February the Nazis, now in power, had \\"unleashed a campaign of violence and terror that dwarfed anything seen so far.\\" Storm troopers began attacking trade union and Communist Party (KPD) offices and the homes of left- wingers,Evand, Richard J., The Coming of the Third Reich, Penguin Press, New York, 2004, p.317 extending their violence to Social Democrats later in the month. When the votes were counted the Communist share of the vote was down to 12.3%, but Weidauer retained his seat under the rules then in force. Despite all their efforts in the run-up to the election the Nazi Party still failed to gain an overall majority of seats in the Reichstag. However, on 23 March 1933 they passed an Enabling Act, which in effect transformed the Hitler government into a legally sanctioned dictatorship. Political parties other than the Nazi Party were banned, and the Communist Party, as could have been predicted from Hitler's rhetoric over the previous decade, was at the top of the Nazi hit- list. March 1933 was Walter Weidauer's last month as a member of the national legislature. Later in 1933 he was detained in the recently opened Sonnenburg concentration camp. =Nazi Germany: exile and imprisonment= In 1934, on his release from the concentration camp, Weidauer undertook further work for the Communist Party, which now counted as illegal activity. During 1934 and 1935 he underwent further terms of \\"investigatory detention\\" in Schwarzenberg and Dresden. At the end of September 1935 he emigrated to Prague. In December 1936 he moved on to Denmark where, using the cover name \\"Karl F√∂rster\\", he worked with the northern regional German Communist Party (now in exile). In April 1938, \\"in absentia\\", he had his German citizenship withdrawn. In April 1940 Denmark was occupied by the German army and Weidauer was interned. At the start of 1941 he was returned to Germany by the police and after a further period of detention on 3 June 1942 he was put on trial (briefly) in the People's Court (Volksgerichtshof), a special court set up by the government outside the constitutional frame of law and used for trials involving a widely drawn range of \\"political offenses\\". He received the conventional fifteen-year prison sentence for \\"Preparing to commit High Treason\\". For over three years he was held in a succession of prisons including those at Brandenburg-G√∂rden, Waldheim and Leipzig. In February 1945, after the Destruction of Dresden, Weidauer was part of a Prisoners' Detachment moved to the city to help make a start on clearing the residual rubble. His detention was ended on 7/8 May 1945 when the Red Army arrived in Dresden. =Soviet occupation zone= The end of World War II, in May 1945, heralded a return to multi-party politics and on his release Walter Weidauer rejoined the KPD. The whole of Saxony now fell within the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany. He also joined the local \\"Anti-Fascist Committee\\" for the Strehlen quarter of Dresden. The whole of the area was under Soviet Military Administration, and before the end of May 1945 Weidauer had been placed in charge of regional administration for Dresden-Leuben. On 5 July 1945 he became first deputy lord mayor of Dresden, serving at this time under \\"Lord Mayor\\" ('), Johannes M√ºller. In this position Weidauer enjoyed the support of the leading Communist party functionaries in Saxony, and Kurt Fischer, which already gave him great power over city administration. Weidauer's political approach was appropriate to the times. He justified his newly acquired power on the grounds that he possessed \\"proper political convictions\\"‚Äûanst√§ndige politische Gesinnung‚Äú while condemning political opponents as reactionaries. The German Democratic Republic would be founded formally only in October 1949, but already the basis for a return to one-party government had created in April 1946, under Soviet administration, with the contentious merger between the old Communist Party and the Moderate- left SPD. Walter Weidauer was one of thousands of Communist Party members who promptly signed his membership across to the new SED (party) which would become the young country's ruling party under its ever more overtly Soviet style constitution. =Oberb√ºrgermeister= In October 1945 Johannes M√ºller ceased to be Lord Mayor of Dresden, following a speech in which he had mentioned the difficulties of pursuing the rebuilding of Dresden while having to work in collaboration with the Soviet administrators. He was succeeded by Gustav Lei√üner who held the office for just over a year. At a time when mayoral responsibilities were focused on food and shelter, Lei√üner was an energetic administrator who tried to stand aside from the political parties, but this involved working with the major parties from both sides of the political spectrum, including the \\"bourgeois\\" parties, the CDU and the LDPD. The \\"bourgeois\\" parties appreciated a bipartisan approach, which nevertheless ran counter to the increasingly apparent agenda of the new Soviet sponsored SED. At a City Council meeting on 10 October 1946 Walter Weidauer was elected Lord Mayor (Oberb√ºrgermeister) of Dresden in succession to Gustav Lei√üner after the SED councilors had taken the meeting by surprise and withdrawn their support from Lei√üner. The new mayors most pressing priorities covered matters on which he had already been working such as police and personnel decisions along with rebuilding the city. In October 1947 a de-Nazification Commission was also established, over which Weidauer presided in person. He would be re- elected Lord Mayor and confirmed in office by the Party Central Committee in 1950, 1953 and 1957, resigning eventually in 1958 (possibly on health grounds). High on the agenda during his early years in office was the ongoing clearance of wreckage and the rebuilding of the city. He had already, in January 1946, produced a paper entitled \\"1946, the first year of the great rebuilding\\" in which he set out a proposed political framework. There was a lively debate on the \\"rebuild or new build?\\" question. Weidauer himself was a proponent of \\"new build\\", and had no time for architectural treasures or the care of old memorials. He conducted a vigorous and long-running public argument with the Dresden art historian and conservationist on the issues involved. Nearly sixty years later Weidauer was still identified in an opinionated press report on the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche as a \\"concrete- headed communist\\". Despite his own well known reservations about the nature and extent of Dresden's cultural and artistic heritage, Weidauer was the president of the government delegation that arranged for the recovery from the Soviet Union of Dresden's Old Masters' Gallery's artistic treasures (which had been placed in safe storage during World War II, but then confiscated by the Red Army in 1945). In connection with this he traveled to Moscow in August 1955 as part of a high-profile East German government delegation. Sustaining international contacts on behalf of his country's ruling party was important to Weidauer, who also visited West Germany as a representative of the Socialist \\"New Germany\\". On 3 December 1958, with the agreement of the city council, Walter Weidauer resigned as mayor. He had already, on 29 November, accepted an alternative appointment as Dresden District Council Chairman in succession to Rudolf Jahn. However, on 21 January 1961 Weidauer was released from this office as well, on account of serious illness. This marked his retirement, although in the event he would continue to be politically active in less full-time capacities for many years. He remained a member of the Dresden city council till 1967. He also retained his position in the Dresden Party Leadership and district head of the AntiFascist Resistance fighters. =Power beyond the city limits= Beyond his responsibilities in the city itself, Weidauer also sat as a member of the regional legislative assembly (Landtag) for Saxony, where he chaired the \\"Communities Committee\\" from 1946 till 1952 when the regional assemblies and the regional tier of government were abolished in the German Democratic Republic: this was part of a process of concentrating power within The Party that had been under way since before the country's foundation three years earlier. Naturally he was also a member of the city and regional party leaderships. In addition, during the late 1940s and early 1950s Weidauer was a member of various community organisations and associations, propagating new theories of community politics, above all in opposition to the more parliamentary approach favoured by the despised \\"bourgeois parties\\". However, following the foundation of the state in 1949, the abolition of the regional tier of government in 1952, and the taming of the \\"bourgeois parties\\", community politics became ever less important. During 1948/49 Weidauer was a member of the German People's Council and then, until its abolition, of the (provisional) Chamber of States (L√§nderkammer), a legislative chamber secondary in status and function to the more prominent People's Chamber (Volkskammer): the L√§nderkammer had already been largely sidelined some years before its formal abolition in 1958. =Retirement and death= After his retirement from full-time politics Walter Weidauer turned to historical research, focusing in particular on the destruction of the city in February 1945.Walter Weidauer, Inferno Dresden, Berlin, 1966 He also found himself compelled to ideological confrontation of the \\"toxic role of German imperialism\\".

It was originally known as a boarding school, although a significant proportion of its students are now day pupils or flexi-boarders. The headmaster is Jeremy Wyld, who has been in post since September 2019. History St Hugh's School was founded by Ronnie and Joan Forbes in 1925, initially in a three-storied house on the corner of Iddesleigh Road and Stanhope Avenue. The school expanded rapidly, spreading into another house which later became the offices of Woodhall Spa UDC. In 1929, the school moved to the present site on Cromwell Avenue, with the buildings being extended and enlarged in 1929 and 1933. In 1940, when Lincolnshire airfields became a target for the Luftwaffe and the school buildings were commandeered for military use, St Hugh's was evacuated to Storrs Hall in the Lake District, until it was deemed safe to return in 1944. Fairmead House, a former girls' school, was purchased for use as a senior boys' boarding house in 1946, with the war-time huts in the garden being put to various uses, and in 1952, Austral House, renamed \\"Dominies\\", was added as the headmaster's house. On the death of the founder in 1960, an advisory council was established to govern the school, chaired by Rt Rev'd Kenneth Riches, Bishop of Lincoln. The school became a charitable trust in 1964 and became co-educational in 1980. The school is named after Saint Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln but also Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln. Little St Hugh was a child whose alleged murder by Jews in 1255 formed one of the most well-known and persistent anti-semitic blood libels. The Church of England formally apologised for the Little St Hugh allegations in 1955.See Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln for full references In some ballads retelling the story, Hugh was playing with a ball, which he lost over the wall of a neighbouring Jewish family, and was murdered after being invited into the garden to retrieve it.See Sir Hugh for full references and versions of the ballad Mrs Forbes was familiar with the myth while Mr Forbes asserted that this story should remind his boys to maintain control, both of the ball and where they were allowed to play with it. The story and its moral were represented in the school badge, which showed a ball flying over a wall. In 2020, the school's governing board removed the circle from the logo, retaining the bricks \\"to reiterate the significance of the educational building blocks\\". Campus The school sits on a campus on the edge of the village of Woodhall Spa. The original building, an Edwardian villa, has been much extended and the buildings on campus now include a teaching block, a science block, a music school, a library, an assembly hall and a nursery school and pre-prep department. The school has a swimming pool and a sports hall. The cricket pavilion looks over the of playing field and the Lincolnshire farmland beyond. Fairmead House (for senior boys' boarding) and Dominies (the headmaster's house) were sold as part of the restructuring of the school in the 1990s. All senior boarders are now accommodated in the main building and in Raftshund House--an Arts and Crafts villa next door. Houses The school uses the house system, with each pupil being placed in a house when they join the school. The houses are named after three former headmasters; Forbes Kelham and Wheeler. Academic Pupils study the usual core subjects of maths, English and the sciences, together with ICT, history, geography, art, cookery, DT, RS and textiles. Language teaching includes French and either Spanish or Latin. Pupils also engage in music, drama and PE and games. Sports The main sports for boys are football, cricket and Rugby football.. Older boys also play rugby sevens and hockey. Girls play hockey, netball and rounders. The children also compete in cross country running and athletics. The school has its own swimming pool, and is the regional champion at U9 and U11 level.http://www.eastlindseytarget.co.uk/Young-swimmers-travel-Skegness- Coastal-Wolds/story-20656863-detail/story.html Other sports available include badminton, basketball, creative dance, gymnastics, handball and orienteering. Extra curricular The school has an active music department with two choirs, and an orchestra which often plays full symphony pieces. In addition to curricular drama lessons, all senior pupils have the chance to participate in a full-length musical production, accompanied by a professional band, in the spring term each year. In addition, there is a range of productions for children in different age groups throughout the school year. The school operates a forest school in its woodland.

Lameness in horses has a variety of causes, and treatment must be tailored to the type and degree of injury, as well as the financial capabilities of the owner. Treatment may be applied locally, systemically, or intralesionally, and the strategy for treatment may change as healing progresses. The end goal is to reduce the pain and inflammation associated with injury, to encourage the injured tissue to heal with normal structure and function, and to ultimately return the horse to the highest level of performance possible following recovery. The process of healing =Bone= The callus formed due to splint bone injury can become large and put pressure on the suspensory ligament. Bone heals by formation of a callus over the defective area. Speed and quality of healing is directly related to the blood supply and fracture stability. Rest is required immediately following injury to reduce movement of the fracture site. Stability may be improved through use of surgical implants or casting, depending on the location of extent of the fracture. Shock wave therapy is sometimes employed in the case of splint bone fracture or stress fractures to the cannon bones, to improve blood flow to the area. Fractures within a joint, such as chip fractures in the knee, hock, or fetlock, require arthroscopic surgery to prevent secondary arthritis of that joint. In some cases, the callus may place pressure on surrounding soft tissue structures. The callus of a splint bone fracture can push on the adjacent suspensory ligament, leading to lameness from secondary suspensory desmitis. Treatment usually involves the removal of the offending callus. The act of standing can place considerable strain on a fracture site. On average, bone heals better than soft tissue. It requires less time to heal and, unlike soft tissue which is always weaker after healing, bone heals to 100% strength. However, fracture healing in horses is complicated by their size, flightiness, and desire to stand. Horses are at risk of re-injury of the fracture site, especially when trying to rise after lying down, or when recovering from anesthesia following fracture repair. Forced recumbency is not an option for horses, making healing more difficult. Weight bearing on a single front or hind limb increases the likelihood of support limb laminitis. Additionally, the cost of casting or surgical fixation makes treatment financially unattainable for some owners. While limb fractures are no longer a death-sentence for horses, it is still considered a very serious injury. In general, a horse is more likely to survive if it is small in stature and has a good temperament that will tolerate the months of inactivity required for healing. Fractures that are open, comminuted (very fragmented), or located higher on the limb tend to have a poorer prognosis. =Synovial joints= Lameness is most commonly associated with injury to synovial joints, or those joints containing articular cartilage, a joint capsule, and a synovial membrane. Joint disease may affect the joint capsule and synovial membrane, articular cartilage, subchondral bone (the bone underneath the cartilage), menisci, or any ligaments associated with the joint. Damage to any of these tissues leads to inflammation, which is especially problematic in the joint. While degeneration of articular cartilage is a common disease process in working animals, resulting in osteoarthritis, cartilage is aneural (does not contain nerves) and does not produce pain. Pain associated with osteoarthritis is secondary to joint capsule pain, due to joint distention and reduced range of motion, or to pain from the underlying bone, which may become damaged following erosion of the articular cartilage. Inflammatory products, such as inflammatory mediators and cytokines, damage articular cartilage and have been shown to weaken intra-articular ligaments. Therefore, treatment of joint disease should not only address the primary injury producing inflammation, but also the inflammatory cycle that leads to further tissue damage. Cryotherapy, joint lavage, systemic anti- inflammatories, or intra-articular medications are used to reduce joint inflammation. In the case of severe joint pathology such as an osteochondral chip, intra-articular fracture, osteochondritis dissecans lesion, or ligamentous or meniscal injury, arthroscopy may be required to ensure normal function of that joint. Debris within the joint, such as from a chip fracture, can cause long term damage to the synovium and articular cartilage leading to osteoarthritis, and is therefore best removed. Following acute injury, joints often benefit from specialized physical therapy, such as swimming, to prevent the loss of range of motion associated with joint capsule fibrosis. Treatment of joint cartilage injury is difficult and often unrewarding. Partial- thickness defects do not heal. The body will try to repair full-thickness cartilage defects using scar tissue or fibrocartilage, both of which are poor substitutes for normal, healthy articular cartilage. Current treatment includes arthroscopy-produced microfratures within the subchondral plate. These microfractures encourage an inflammatory response within the defect, which recruits stem cells to the area. Unfortunately, these cells differentiate into fibrocartilage, rather than normal joint (hyaline) cartilage, leading to inferior tissue repair at the site of injury. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) has shown some benefits when grafted into the area following microtrauma. However, the primary treatment for degenerative joint disease involves reducing the inflammatory process that is known to accelerate articular cartilage degeneration. =Tendon and ligament= Healing of soft tissue injury is often monitored with ultrasound. Tendon is primarily composed of elastic type I collagen. However, mature tendon contains cells that have a limited ability to regenerate. Following injury, tendon lays down type III collagen, or scar tissue, which is stronger than type I collagen but stiffer and less-elastic. This makes it less distensible and more likely to re-injure when the horse begins to stretch the tendon during strenuous work. Certain treatments may improve the final tendon fiber quality, and subsequently increase the likelihood that the horse will return to full performance post-injury. Healing of soft tissue injury is often monitored using ultrasound to assess the lesion size and fiber pattern. Monitoring soft tissue injury with ultrasound allows for a more scientific determination of when to introduce exercise back into the horse's rehabilitation program, and for quick intervention should the injury worsen. Recently, a new ultrasound technique called color Doppler ultrasonography has been used to assess equine tendon injuries. Color Doppler measures the degree of blood flow to a lesion, allowing for more accurate assessment of healing. Rest and hand-walking Rest is almost always recommended for treatment of lameness because it reduces forces placed on damaged tissue, allowing the normal process of healing to occur. Type and severity of injury determines the duration and degree of rest required. Aggressive limitations of activity may be required in cases of fracture. Horses are kept tied for the several-month duration of healing, to prevent them from lying down and potentially re- injuring the bone while trying to stand. In other cases, rest may be contraindicated. Animals with a history of upward fixation of the patella, polysaccharide storage myopathy,Valberg SJ. A Review of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Rhabdomyolysis in Foals. Proc. AAEP 2002(48) 117-121. and equine recurrent rhabdomyolysis are often best kept on a schedule of regular exercise. Rest may be counterproductive if the lameness is secondary to osteoarthritis. In this case, mild exercise improves joint mobility and lameness can worsen with confinement. Rest may vary from strict confinement (‚Äústall rest‚Äù), to small paddock or pasture turnout, to reduction of exercise intensity. Horses are often unpredictable when on prolonged stall rest, which greatly increases the risk of re-injury when hand-walking is begun. Sedation or additional forms of restraint may be needed to help control the horse during this initial period of increased exercise intensity. While rest may be implemented as the only form of treatment, specialized treatment often improves overall recovery, and is recommended if the client desires the animal to return to full athletic function. Horses are often confined to small paddocks to help reduce movement. Soft tissue and bone strengthen with exercise and weaken if it is not actively used. Horses that undergo long-term stall rest require a slow, progressive rehabilitation program to try to prevent re-injury of the original tissue or injury to a new area now weakened by prolonged disuse. In some cases of soft tissue injury, low-impact exercise, such as hand walking or walking under tack, can be more beneficial if introduced in the early healing phase rather than adhering to strict stall rest alone. Tendons and ligaments heal by formation of scar tissue, which is less elastic and lacks the very regular, organized pattern of fibrils of normal tissue.Dahlgren LA. Review of Treatment Options for Equine Tendon and Ligament Injuries: What‚Äôs New and How Do They Work? Proc. AAEP 2005 (51) 376-382. Exercise helps to encourage proper fiber alignment, and subsequently leads to a tissue that is closer to its original elasticity. In cases of acute injury, joints benefit from rest to allow for reduction of the inflammatory process within the joint. Hand walking is often recommended during times of stall rest to help prevent adhesion formation and fibrosis within the damaged joint, to maintain range of motion, and prevent atrophy of the articular cartilage. Hand walking is used in cases of cellulitis to reduce edema formation in the tissues. Cellulitis leads to an extreme degree of swelling, which can persist after elimination of the underlying cause and result in long-term lameness. Therefore, reduction of edema is a very important part of treatment, and walking is often performed multiple times each day.Getman LM Alternative Therapies for Cellulitis. Proc. ACVS (2011) 585-587. Cryotherapy, thermotherapy, and compression Bandaging is often used to apply compression to the lower legs. Cold application to the skin (cryotherapy) is used to decrease pain and inflammation of acute soft tissue injuries. At a cellular level, cold application decreases the formation of exudate and diapedesis of inflammatory cells, thereby reducing edema. Cryotherapy has also been shown to reduce metabolism and thus oxygen demand of tissues, helping to prevent hypoxic tissue damage. Cold is often applied to the site of injury by hosing cold water onto the area (hydrotherapy), icing, or medical devices such as the Game Ready system that provides both cold therapy and compression. Cold salt-water spas are also available, and are used to bathe a patient's injury in aerated, hypertonic, cold water. This combines the benefits of cryotherapy with the osmotic effect of salt, producing better analgesia and reduction of inflammation. Heat (thermotherapy) is usually applied at least 48‚Äì72 hours after the initial injury. It is used to improve blood flow and subsequently healing, and to increase extensibility of tissues. Improved blood flow can also encourage fluid reabsorption, which reduces swelling, and encourages phagocytic cells to enter the site of the injury. Liniments are sometimes used to increase heat to an area. Both heat and cold have been shown to decrease muscle spasm and pain. Often compression is used concurrently in the form of pressure wraps, to reduce edema and swelling. Pressure wraps are usually used as long as inflammation is active. Bandaging is especially important in cases of severe swelling, such as cellulitis, which can cause continued lameness if the edema persists after the initial cause has been successfully treated. Bandaging may also be helpful in reducing pain, by stimulating mechanoreceptors.McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Current Treatments for Traumatic Synovitis, Capsulitis, and Osteoarthritis. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 180-182. Bandaging is often used to keep wounds clean, but has been shown to increase the risk of exuberant granulation tissue (‚Äúproud flesh‚Äù) formation. Casting may be used to completely immobilize a joint, which is important in the case of destabilizing injury, but increases the risk of adhesion formation within a joint, and muscle and joint cartilage atrophy. In the case of joint pain secondary to capsulitis or synovitis, which are not destabilizing, complete immobilization of the joint should be avoided. Joint supplements Various neutraceuticals (supplements) are available for equine joint health. Although these products are evaluated for safety, they are not required to prove efficacy, and actual scientific support of their benefits for osteoarthritis in horses are poor. This includes studies on supplements containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). Because they are not regulated, joint supplements are not required to contain what has been listed on the label. Additionally, oral joint supplements may have questionable bioavailability. However, these products are still popular, with anecdotal support for their use, and have little downside for use except for cost to the owner. Use of NSAIDs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a mainstay of lameness treatment, providing analgesia (pain relief) and reducing inflammation. The term NSAID is used to refer to a specific drug class that inhibits the conversion of arachadonic acid into prostaglandins and thromboxane.McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 182-187. Reduction of prostaglandin helps to reduce pain, decrease vasodilation (and subsequent edema formation), and the diminish the effects of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1. The most commonly used NSAIDs in the United States is phenylbutazone, although flunixin meglumine and firocoxib are also commonly used for orthopedic pain. Despite their widespread use, NSAIDs do have the potential to cause severe toxicity, including GI ulceration, renal tubule disease, renal papillary necrosis, and right dorsal colitis.MacAllister CG, Morgan SJ, Borne AT, Pollet RA. (1993) Effects of large doses of phenylbutazone, flunixin meglumine, and ketoprofen in horses. J. Am. Vet. Med. Ass. 202, 71-77. This is seen most commonly when NSAIDs are used long-term, if they are used at a dose that is higher than recommended, or if two different NSAIDs are used in combination (a method known as ‚Äústacking‚Äù). Stacking has been shown to have no benefit in reducing pain and a much greater chance of producing toxicity. Some NSAIDs can decrease proteoglycan synthesis, especially in cases of cartilage that is already diseased, which can worsen joint disease.Brandt KD. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and articular cartilage. J. Rheumatol. 1987;14(Suppl):132-133. However, this side effect does not occur with all drugs in the NSAID class, including phenylbutazone. Diclofenac is a topical NSAID. It has a clear benefit over traditional NSAIDs in that topical application reduces the amount of drug circulating systemically, and therefore reduces the risk of negative side effects. Diclofenac has been shown to reduce lameness secondary to joint pain in horses.Bertone JJ, Lynn RC, Vatistas NJ, Kelch WJ, Sifferman RL, Hepler DI. Clinical Field Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of Topically Applied Diclofenac Liposomal Cream for the Relief of Joint Lameness in Horses. Proc. AAEP, 2002, Vol 48. 190-193. Corrective trimming and shoeing Various types of shoes are available to alter forces placed on the hoof and lower leg. Corrective trimming and shoeing is used to alter the forces placed on the hoof and soft tissues of the digit and lower leg. The goal is to reduce strain or load on structures that are at-risk of damage secondary to conformation, movement, or past injury, or to treat areas that are healing and can no longer handle normal forces. Evaluation of the horse's conformation, hoof balance, and shoeing is often a first step in treatment of lameness. A correct, balanced trim is a key component of lameness treatment and prevention. Some cases of lameness, such as angular limb deformities and navicular syndrome, are best managed with special trimming and shoeing. In very complex cases, a farrier that focuses on corrective shoeing and trimming may be recommended for the duration of treatment. Adjustments in trimming or shoeing can be made to help support the hoof, allowing pressure to be distributed over healthy tissue in order reduce the force over damaged or diseased tissue. Application of various types of therapeutic shoes, pads, and wedges, can be used to help alter stress placed on structures within the foot or the lower limb. Hospital plates‚Äîspecial shoes that keep the entire sole clean but can be opened to allow for daily treatment‚Äîare sometimes recommended for injuries to the bottom of the hoof such hoof abscesses or canker. Intramuscular or intravenous joint therapies =Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (Adequan)= Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (PSGAGs) are drugs originally labeled for intra-articular use, but are commonly given intramuscularly to horses. They have a chondroprotective effect and are given to try to prevent or slow cartilage destruction in cases of osteoarthritis, and are often used in cases of cartilage damage of a joint.McIlwraith CW. Intra-articular medication for traumatic joint problems: Do we understand the choices? Compend Contin Educ Pract Vet 1989;11:1287‚Äì1311. PSGAGs have been shown to have several beneficial effects on the joint: they inhibit enzymes that break down cartilage,Howell DS, Carreno M, Pelletier J-P, et al. Articular cartilage breakdown in a lapine model of osteoarthritis. Clin Orthop Rel Res 1986;213:69 ‚Äì76.Theiler R, Thosh P, Brooks P.

In vivo kinetic study on uptake and distribution of intramuscular tritium-labeled polysulfated glycosaminoglycan in equine synovial fluid and articular cartilage. Proc. AAEP 1991;37:241‚Äì242. The degree of these effects in horses after intramuscular injection has relatively little support in the current literature. However, there is much anecdotal evidence of their benefits for synovitis and osteoarthritis, and PSGAGs are very commonly used by veterinarians in the United States involved in racehorse and show horse practice.Caron JP, Kaneene JB, Miller R. Results of a survey of equine practitioners on the use and perceived efficacy of polysulfated glycosaminoglycan. Am J Vet Res 1996;209: 1564 ‚Äì1568. PSGAG is sold under the trade name Adequan. It is a mix of low-molecular weight glycosaminoglycans made from bovine trachea and lung. It is labeled to be used every 4 days, for a total of 7 doses. =Hyaluronic acid= Intravenous formulations of hyaluronic acid (HA) are available under the trade names Legend and Hyonate. In osteochondral fragmentation models, intravenous HA has been shown to decrease lameness, improve the synovial membrane, and lower protein and prostaglandin E2 levels within joints.Kawcak CE, Frisbie DD, McIlwraith CW, et al. Effects of intravenous administration of sodium hyaluronate on carpal joints in exercising horses after arthroscopic surgery and osteochondral fragmentation. Am J Vet Res 1997;58:1132‚Äì 1140. Additionally, it was shown to have positive effects on racing Quarter Horses, leading to a greater number of starts, a longer career, and more money earned, but these horses were also treated with IA corticosteroids at an earlier point of their career, potentially confounding the results.McIlwraith CW, Goodman NL, Frisbie DD. Prospective study in the prophylactic value of intravenous hyaluronan in two- year-old racing Quarter Horses, in Proc. AAEP 1998;269‚Äì271. Another study in Thoroughbreds found no improvement when using IV hyaluronic acid. However, there is much anecdotal support from trainers of different disciplines, and it remains a popular therapy. =Polyglycan= Polyglycan is a combination of sodium hyaluronate, sodium chondroitin sulfate, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. It is labeled as a medical device, to be used for joint lavage following surgery, but is used by some equine practitioners off-label, given IV or IM. =Pentosan polysulfate= Pentosan polysulfate, like Adequan, has been shown to improve signs of osteoarthritis. In non-equine models, Pentosan has been shown to increase proteoglycan synthesis,Reichelt L, Forster K, Fischer M, et al. Efficacy and safety of intramuscular glucosamine sulfate in osteoarthritis of the knee.

Joint destruction in arthritis and osteoarthritis. Austin, TX: Birkhauser, 1993;195. Pentosan is made from hemicellulose of beechwood, and has been shown to improve joint function in sheep models, and improve cartilage in horses. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it can lead to a significant improvement of lameness in racehorses.Little C, Ghosh P. Potential use of pentosan polysulfate for the treatment of equine joint disease. In: McIlwraith CW, Trotter GW, eds. Joint disease in the horse. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1996;281‚Äì292. Intrasynovial therapy (joint injections) and joint lavage =Corticosteroids= Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatories. They stabilize lysosomal membranes, inhibit inflammatory cell movement and reduce their function, and subsequently decrease the level of inflammatory mediators within the joint.Axelrod L. Glucocorticoids. In: Harris ED, Kelley WN, Ruddy S, Sledge CB, eds. Textbook of rheumatology, 4th ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1993;779. Additionally, hyaluronic acid levels in synovial fluid have been found to increase following IA injection of corticosteroids.Tulamo R-M. Comparison of high-performance liquid chromatography with a radiometric assay for determination of the effect of intra-articular administration of corticosteroid and saline solution on synovial hyaluronate concentration in horses. Am J Vet Res 1991;52:1940 ‚Äì1944. The most commonly used intra-articular steroids used in the United States are methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetonide, and betamethasone esters. Corticosteroids have been implicated as damaging to joints if used repeatedly, although research has shown these results to be drug-specific. Methylprednisolone appears to be most associated with these negative effects, and can lead to decreased proteoglycan synthesis, decreased synovial vascularity, and damage to articular cartilage. Proteoglycans within the joint are depleted, especially in younger animals, even when the steroid is used concomitantly with chondroprotective drugs such as PSGAGs.Fubini SL, Boatwright CE, Todhunter RJ, Lust G. Effect of intramuscularly administered polysulfated glycosaminoglycan on articular cartilage from equine joints injected with methylprednisolone acetate. Am J. of Vet. Research. 1993, 54(8): 1359-1365. Betamethasone administration has not been shown to have detrimental effects on articular cartilage. Triamcinolone acetonide is potentially chondroprotective, producing more proteoglycan, decreasing synovial protein and inflammatory cell levels, and improving cartilage.Kawcak CE, Norrdin RW, Frisbie DD, Trotter GW, McIl- wraith CW. Effects of osteochondral fragmentation and intra-articular triamcinolone acetonide treatment on subchondral bone in the equine carpus. Equine Vet J 1998;30:66 ‚Äì71. Because of its potentially chondroprotective effects, triamcinolone is usually chosen to treat high-motion joints. Some practitioners chose to use methylprednisone to treat low-motion joints, especially of the distal hock, for the sole purpose of destroying the cartilage and reducing the time to natural ankylosis. However, there is no evidence to support the use of methylprednisolone to produce joint fusion of the hock. Additionally, there is concern of inducing laminitis in horses treated with IA triamcinolone. It has been shown that up to 18 mg of triamcinolone can be used safely.Bathe AP. The corticosteroid laminitis story: 3. The clinician‚Äôs viewpoint. Equine Vet J 2007; 39:12-13. Horses are at increased risk of laminitis if they have pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, but in general the benefits of corticosteroid use outweigh the risks. =Hyaluronic acid= Hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan, HA) is naturally occurring component of synovial fluid and the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage. It is produced by the synovial membrane and makes the synovial fluid viscous, lubricates the joint,Gibbs DA, Merrill EW, Smith KA. Rheology of hyaluronic acid. Biopolymers 1968;6:777‚Äì791.Radin EL, Paul IL. A consolidated concept of joint lubrication. J Bone Jt Surg 1972;54A:607‚Äì 616. and affects compressibility of articular cartilage.Freeman MAR, Kempson GE. Load carriage, adult articular cartilage. In: Freeman MAR, ed. Adult articular car- tilage, 1st ed. New York: Grune & Stratton, Inc., 1972; 228. It may also have some effect on the solute content and white blood cell concentration within the joint fluid.Ogston AG, Phelps CF. The partition of solutes between buffer solutions and solutions containing hyaluronic acid. Biochem J 1960;78:827‚Äì833. HA is commonly injected intra-articular (IA) into diseased joints, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. HA concentration and molecular weight are sometimes lower in diseased joints, but this is not always the case.McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronan). Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 194-200. Exogenously administered HA has a half-life of 96 hours in normal joints but is shorter in diseased joints.Hilbert BJ, Rowley G, Antonas KN, et al. Changes in the synovia after the intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate into normal horse joints and after arthrotomy and experimental cartilage damage. Aust Vet J 1985;62:182‚Äì184. It is hypothesized that a portion of HA localizes in the joint and increases metabolism of synoviocytes.Ghosh P. Osteoarthritis and hyaluronan‚Äîpalliative or disease-modifying treatment? Sem Arth Rheum 1993;22: 1‚Äì3. High molecular weight HA has been shown to offer better protection of articular cartilage than low molecular weight,Kikuchi T, Yamada H, Shimmei M.

Equine Vet Sci 1989;9:39‚Äì40. =Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (PSGAGs)= Intra- articular use of PSGAGs has been shown to improve lameness, signs of arthritis, joint effusion, and synovial fluid quality.Tew WP. Demonstration by synovial fluid analysis of the efficacy in horses of an investigational drug (L-1016). J Equine Vet Sci 1982;March/April:42‚Äì50.Altman RD, Dean DD, Muniz O, et al. Prophylactic treatment of canine osteoarthritis with glycosaminoglycan polysulfuric acid ester. Arth Rheum 1989;32:759-766. However, mixed results have been reported on its ability to actually repair cartilaginous defects present at time of injection.McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycan. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 201-206. IA use of PSGAGs may have an increased risk of Staphylococcus aureus infections within the joint when compared to intra-articular injections of other substances,Gustafson SB, McIlwraith CW, Jones RL.

Use of local anesthetics for long-term pain relief is impractical, due to their short duration. =Joint lavage= Joint lavage involves placing two large bore needles into a diseased joint and flushing it with sterile saline. Lavage helps to remove inflammatory mediators, which is common in cases of synovitis, as well as any damaging debris such as articular cartilage. This procedure may be performed standing, but a more thorough lavage using a greater volume of saline may be used when performed under general anesthesia. Joint lavage is a regular component of arthroscopic surgery. It is especially helpful in patients with severe lameness secondary to acute synovitis. Other Medications =Bisphosphonates= Tiludronate disodium (Tildren) and Clodronate disodium (Osphos) are FDA-approved bisphosphonates used to reduce bone reabsorption by inhibiting osteoclasts.Rogers MJ, Crockett JC, Coxon FP, Monkkonen J. 2011. Biochemical and molecular mechanisms of action of bisphosphonates. Bone 49:34-41 They are most commonly used for the treatment of navicular diseaseCoudry V, Thibaud D, Riccio B, Audigie F, Didierlaurent D, Denoix JM. 2007. Efficacy of tiludronate in the treatment of horses with signs of pain associated with osteoarthritic lesions of the thoracolumbar vertebral column. American Journal of Veterinary Research 68:329-337 and osteoarthritic conditions such as bone spavin.Gough MR, Thibaud D, Smith RK. 2010. Tiludronate infusion in the treatment of bone spavin: a double blind placebo-controlled trial. Equine Veterinary Journal 42:381-387 Tildren is given intravenously, either systemically injected into the jugular vein, or locally through use of regional limb perfusion. Osphos is given intramuscularly, divided into 3 different injection sites. Both drugs were approved for use in the United States in 2014. =Vasodilators= Isoxsuprine and pentoxifylline are two commonly used vasodilators in equine medicine. Isoxsuprine has been shown to have vasodilatory and red blood cell deformability properties.Aarts PA, Banga JD, van Houwelingen HC, Heethaar RM, Sixma JJ. Increased red blood cell deformability due to isoxsuprine administration decreases platelet adherence in a perfusion chamber: a double- blind cross-over study in patients with intermittent claudication. Blood. 1986 May;67(5):1474-81. Pentoxifylline has been shown to decrease blood viscosity, reduce platelet aggregation, and increase red blood cell deformability. These properties are thought to improve blood flow to the digit, and makes them popular drugs for treatment of navicular disease and laminitis. However, some studies have shown oral isoxsuprine and pentoxifylline to have little to no effect on digital blood flow.Ingle-Feh JE, Baxter GM. The effect of oral isoxsuprine and pentoxifylline on digital and laminar blood flow in healthy horses. Vet. Surg. 1999; 28(3):154-60. The lack of efficacy of isoxsuprine may be partially due to its poor oral bioavailability (2.2%) and high first pass effect.Erkert RS, Macallister CG. Isoxsuprine hydrochloride in the horse: a review. J Vet Pharmacol Ther. 2002 Apr;25(2):81-7. While pentoxyfylline has a better bioavailability after oral dosing, its absorption may decrease with repeated administration.Liska, Dana A., et al. \\"Pharmacokinetics of pentoxifylline and its 5-hydroxyhexyl metabolite after oral and intravenous administration of pentoxifylline to healthy adult horses.\\" American journal of veterinary research 67.9 (2006): 1621-1627. Pentoxyfilline has been shown to reduce lameness in horses with experimentally induced laminitisFugler LA, Eades SC, Koch CE, Keowen ML. Clinical and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory effects of pentoxifylline on carbohydrate overload laminitis: preliminary results. [Abstract]. J Equine Vet Sci. 2010;30(2):106‚Äì107. and has inhibitory effects on matrix metalloproteinases (MMP),Fugler LA, Eades SC, Moore RM, Koch CE, Keowen ML. Plasma matrix metalloproteinase activity in horses after intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide and treatment with matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. Am J Vet Res. 2013;74(3):473‚Äì480. so it may be beneficial for laminitis treatment despite its uncertain effects on digital blood flow. =Methocarbamol= Methocarbamol, sold under the trade name Robaxin, is a muscle relaxant commonly used in horses to treat muscle pain secondary to spasticity, tetanus, or tying-up.Cunningham, F. E., et al. \\"The pharmacokinetics of methocarbamol in the thoroughbred race horse.\\" Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics 15.1 (1992): 96-100. Both oral and injectable forms are on the market. Its use is regulated by many equine competitive governing bodies, since it is thought to have a CNS depressant effect and produces the metabolite guaifenesin, which is a pre-anesthetic veterinary drug.Muir, W.W., Sams, R.A. & Ashcraft, S. (1984) Pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of methocarbamol in the horse. American Journal of Veterinary Research, 45, 2256‚Äì2260. Guaifenesin has been found in the plasma of horses receiving oral, but not intravenous, methocarbamol, likely due to the high first-pass effect of the drug.Rumpler, M. J., Colahan, P., Sams, R. A. The pharmacokinetics of methocarbamol and guaifenesin after single intravenous and multiple-dose oral administration of methocarbamol in the horse. J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap. 37, 25‚Äì34 =Tetracyclines= The tetracyclines are a class of antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties. They have various applications for use in treating equine lameness. As expected, tetracycline antibiotics are used to treat infectious causes of lameness if the infectious organism is sensitive to that antibiotic. Tetracycline is the first choice for treating Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Additionally, tetracyclines have been shown to have anti-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Due to the possible connection between MMPs and laminitis, tetracyclines are sometimes given to prevent or treat laminitis associated with endotoxemia.Fugler, Lee Ann. Matrix Metalloproteinases in the Equine Systemic Inflammatory Response: Implications for Equine Laminitis. Diss. Louisiana State University, 2009. High doses of tetracyclines, much greater than used to treat bacterial infections, are used intravenously in foals to treat flexural limb deformities.Papich, M. G., et al. \\"Pharmacokinetics of oxytetracycline administered intravenously to 4 to 5‚Äêday‚Äêold foals.\\" Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics 18.5 (1995): 375-378. The most commonly used tetracycline is oxytetracycline, and it is most effective when given to the foal when very young. The mechanism of action is unknown. =Gabapentin= Gabapentin, sold under the trade name Neurontin, is used to treat neuropathic pain in horses. It may be given orally or intravenously, although oral bioavailability is fairly poor (~16%), and it can produce sedation and increased drinking. Gabapentin has been used for femoral neuropathy following surgery,Davis, J.L., Posner, L.P. and Elce, Y. (2007) Gabapentin for the treatment of neuropathic pain in a pregnant horse. J. Am. Vet. Med. Ass. 231, 755-758. laminitis, and headshaking in horses. =DMSO= Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a chemical solvent. It is used topically to reduce inflammation associated with an acute injury‚Äîprimarily by reducing edema‚Äîor it may mixed with other substances to improve their absorption through the skin.Koller LD. Clinical application of DMSO by veterinarians in Oregon and Washington. VM/SAC 1976;71:591. DMSO triples the skin penetration ability of corticosteroids.Wood DC, Wood J. Pharmacologic and biochemical considerations of dimethyl sulfoxide. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1975;243:7. DMSO has also been shown to decrease free radical formation, increase blood flow to an area, and is bacteriostatic. DMSO is especially beneficial in the treatment of joint inflammation, since it has a primary anti-inflammatory effect and can increase the effects of hydrocortisone 10-fold when mixed together.Gorog P, Kovacs JB. Antiarthritic and antithrombotic effects of topically applied dimethyl sulfoxide. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1975;243:91. Generally, medical-grade DMSO should be used, and applied while wearing gloves.Rubin LE. Toxicity of dimethyl sulfoxide, alone and in combination. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1975;243:98. Regenerative medicine Regenerative medicine uses the horse's own cells or proteins to improve healing. =Stem cells= Stem cells are capable of both self-renewal and of differentiating into cells of different tissue types, making them exciting possibilities for treating injuries through tissue regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are currently used in horses. The gold-standard source for stem cells is derived from bone marrow, although other sources, such as fat, are also available. A Jamshidi needle used to collect bone marrow. Bone marrow is often harvested from the sternum, ischium, or ileum. The sternum and ileum contain the same quality of stem cells, but the ileum is usually harder to use in horses older than 5 years of age, because the marrow cavity shrinks. Marrow is collected using a Jamshidi needle in a sedated horse. Unlike people, horses usually tolerate the procedure well, with little pain. This sample is cultured by a lab over the course of a few weeks before being shipped back to the horse, and then injected into the site of injury. Adipose-derived MSC are harvested from fat from the abdomen, chest, or tail head. Unlike bone marrow- derived cells, adipose-derived cells are not cultured and expanded, but rather are processed by digesting the fat to produce a stromal vascular fraction. This stromal vascular fraction, a population of nucleated cells, contains only 2-4% MSC. There is currently very limited peer-reviewed data on adipose- derived stem cells. Stem cell therapy is very safe, but is currently expensive, requiring harvesting and processing of the cells. Additionally, autologous stem cells (those harvested from the patient) requires 2‚Äì3 weeks to expand the numbers in culture, delaying treatment of an acute injury. Allogenic (non-self) stem cells may be harvested from other horses ahead of time to have banked for immediate treatment of an injury, but there is some concerns of graft-vs-host disease. Stem cells have been used to treat a variety of injuries in horses. The most research has been performed on stem cells used for treatment of tendon and meniscal injuries. Horses with tendonitis treated with bone marrow derived stem cells had a significantly lower re-injury rate compared to those without treatment.Smith, Roger KW. \\"Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for equine tendinopathy.\\" Disability & Rehabilitation 30.20-22 (2008): 1752-1758. Stem cell treatment in damaged tendons is thought to improve the collagen make-up of the tendon while healing. It has been shown to reduce the presence of Type III collagen, which relatively inelastic and therefore more prone to re-injury, and increase the presence of Type I collagen which is found in normal tendon fibers. Suspensory ligament injuries have also responded favorably to stem cell therapy.Herthel, D.J. (2001). Enhanced suspensory ligament healing in 100 horses by stem cell and other bone marrow components. AAEP Proceedings, 47:319-21. Results using MSC for osteoarthritis, when using joint models, has shown to produce little effect on the treated joint. However, use in joints may be warranted in the case of meniscal injury. In sheep, joints treated with bone marrow derived MSC following damage to a meniscus were shown to have marked regeneration of the meniscus and reduced osteoarthritis. Horses with meniscal damage had a higher percentage return to work following treatment with bone marrow derived MSC, when compared to results from previous studies of horses treated with arthroscopic surgery alone. Additionally, research on use of stem cells to produce improved healing of laminae in laminitic horses is also underway. =Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)= Platelets within the blood release growth factors after they are activated. These growth factors lead to new blood vessel formation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and the generation of connective tissue, which should ultimately improve the speed and quality of healing. The goal of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is to concentrate these growth factors, which may then be injected into a lesion. While PRP does not contain stem cells, it may draw surrounding stem cells to the site of injury. PRP has been used in wounds, tendon and ligament lesions, fractures, bone cysts, and joints to treat osteoarthritis.Cruz AM. Stem Cell and Cell Regeneration: Products and Techniques. Proc. ACVS (2011). 533-539 To produce PRP, the patient's blood is centrifuged to separate the plasma from the red blood cells. The plasma is then further processed to produce a final product approximately 8 times the concentration found in the blood. This final product can be produced in under an hour, making it possible to treat the lesion immediately. PRP is most efficacious when used in acute lesions within 10 days of original injury. Because PRP contains white blood cells, injection of the product has been associated with inflammation following treatment. The concentration of platelets and white blood cells vary between preparations and the individual patient from whom it is drawn, which can affect the degree of anabolic and catabolic molecule concentrations within the PRP. To counteract the negative effects of white blood cells in the PRP preparation, horses are usually prescribed NSAIDs for 3 days following treatment, and several days of cryotherapy. =Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP)= Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine that has been shown to produce a signaling cascade that leads to degradation of cartilage, and which is known to be a critical factor in the formation of osteoarthritis. Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra, or IRAP) inhibits IL-1, and has been shown to reduce the disease process, including improvement in lameness and histological morphology of cartilage and synovium. However, there have been no clinical trials of its efficacy. Because IL-1 targets cartilage, IRAP is ideal for treating joint injury, and is used to treat osteoarthritis, traumatic joint injury, or after surgery. It is not recommended for use in tendon sheaths or bursae, or in joints with damage to the bone, menisci, or ligaments unless these injuries have been treated successfully using arthroscopy. To produce IRAP, blood is collected into a syringe of chromium sulfate-soaked beads and incubated for 24 hours. During this time, white blood cells within the blood produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IRAP. The resulting serum, known as autologous conditioned serum (ACS), is then centrifuged to produce enough ACS for 4-6 doses. The product is injected into the affected joints. This is repeated every 7‚Äì10 days for 2-3 treatments. A newer product, known as IRAP II, has been shown to have modestly higher levels of beneficial cytokines, and lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-Œ±, when compared to the original product IRAP.Hraha, T. H., et al. \\"Autologous conditioned serum: the comparative cytokine profiles of two commercial methods (IRAP and IRAP II) using equine blood.\\" Equine veterinary journal 43.5 (2011): 516-521. =Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC)= BMAC is a form of centrifuged bone marrow that contains stem cells and platelets. Because it is simply centrifuged, and not cultured, BMAC contains significantly fewer stem cells than cultured bone marrow. Like PRP, the concentrated platelets in BMAC contain growth factors, although at a lower concentration than PRP. BMAC also contains a significant number of white blood cells, although it is primarily lymphocytes rather than the pro-inflammatory neutrophils seen in some PRP formulations. BMAC has the benefit of being quickly available, requiring only 10‚Äì20 minutes of centrifugation, allowing immediate treatment of an injury. It is also significantly less expensive when compared to cultured stem cells. BMAC has been used arthroscopically to graft into full-thickness cartilage defects. Studies have shown these grafts to improve the filling of these defects, and to contain primarily type II collagen, the collagen that composes hyaline cartilage, with improved collagen orientation within the defect.Fortier, Lisa A., et al. \\"Concentrated bone marrow aspirate improves full-thickness cartilage repair compared with microfracture in the equine model.\\" The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery 92.10 (2010): 1927-1937. BMAC has also been used for intralesional treatment of tendon and ligament injuries. An older method of bone marrow aspirate therapy does not include centrifugation. This risks injecting bone into the affected soft tissue structure, which may slow healing, and is rarely used today. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is a modality that has uses high-intensity pressure waves to introduce energy into an injured area. ESWT is commonly used for treating orthopedic problems in horses, including tendon and ligament injuries, kissing spine, navicular syndrome, and arthritis. The evidence for these uses is weak. It also appears to reduce pain and as of 2014 became increasingly used along with drugs to manage pain. The practitioner decides upon the specific strength and number of impulses based on the site of injury and personal experience. There is currently no protocol that has been defined for any injury, and such specifications require further research to make definitive recommendations. In general, smaller injuries require fewer impulses than larger areas, and deeper tissues or harder tissues (such as bone) require impulses with more strength than those that are softer or more superficial. The location of delivery is key when treating injuries.Kane, E. Whock wave therapy for lameness. DVM 360 Magazine. May 1, 2005. Mesotherapy Mesotherapy is the process of injecting medication intradermally, in multiple rows, along either side of the spine. This treatment is most commonly used to treat neck and back pain, and is thought to break the pain cycle associated with chronic pain. Often combinations of corticosteroids, local anesthetics, or sarapin are used.Garcia-Lopez J. Kissing Spine Surgery. Proc. ACVC Surgery Summit (2014). 41-45 Physical therapy =Passive flexion= Treadmill speed may be adjusted as the injury heals. Passive flexion may be used to help maintain range of motion in a joint, especially following joint surgery which can predispose the joint to adhesion and formation. =High-speed treadmill= The high-speed treadmill offers the option of adjusting speed, distance, slope, and degree of weight- bearing (through weighted saddles) of the horse. Heart rate may be monitored to assess impact of training on the cardiovascular system. Training factors that are especially stressful to a particular injury, such as degree of slope in a horse with a tendon injury, may be adjusted gradually to slowly increase the force placed on the recovering tissue. This allows for individualized rehabilitation. However, horses require more work on the treadmill when compared to work under-saddle to produce the same degree of oxygen consumption, and therefore the treadmill is not a suitable substitute for regular training with a rider when conditioning an animal for performance. =Underwater treadmill= A horse working on an underwater treadmill. Aquatic therapy has been shown to improve muscle strength, especially in the core, back, and stifles,Adair S. Behind the Scenes: Equine Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Practice. 2014. and to increase both cardiovascular condition and proprioception in horses.McIlwraith CW. Managing Joint Disease in the Racehorse in the Face of Stricter Drug Restrictions. Proc AAEP 2013(59);436-442. The underwater treadmill is a popular tool for equine rehabilitation, and can offer targeted therapy based on water depth. At lower depths, horses will pick their legs up out of the water to clear it in the flight phase of the stride. In this case, the depth may be adjusted to improve the range of motion of a specific joint, offering the option of customizing treatment to a particular injury.Mendez-Angulo, Jose L., et al. \\"Effect of water depth on amount of flexion and extension of joints of the distal aspects of the limbs in healthy horses walking on an underwater treadmill.\\" American journal of veterinary research 74.4 (2013): 557-566. Higher depths can increase pelvic flexion and raising of the back, helping to strengthen muscles that are commonly used by riding horses, conditioning them without the added weight of a rider.Mooij, M. J. W., et al. \\"Biomechanical responses of the back of riding horses to water treadmill exercise.\\" The Veterinary Journal 198 (2013): e120-e123. High water levels can also reduce body mass, similar to the effects seen with swimming, and may be beneficial for joint injuries or fractures. However, the animal will develop muscular and cardiovascular fitness much faster than they will develop skeletal strength. This may make the horse appear to be better-prepared for strenuous work than it truly is, and early return to work may place the bones, joints, tendons, and ligaments at much greater risk of injury. Therefore, care must be taken to build up bone strength before the animal is placed into regular work under-saddle. Swimming is a common rehabilitation method. =Swimming= The buoyancy effect of water makes swimming close to non-weight bearing. It allows the horse to maintain condition while reducing trauma to joints, making it especially useful for animals recovering from joint-related lameness. However, weight-bearing rehabilitation is also important before the animal goes back to normal exercise, since swimming does not maintain joint tone. Additionally, swimming encourages the horse to maintain a hollow, inverted position with the head up, back dropped, and legs kicking out behind it. It is therefore less suitable for riding horses that are expected to develop the strength to carry the back up with an engaged hind end, and may also be associated with back or stifle problems. =Hyperbaric oxygen therapy= Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a treatment where the animal is placed in a chamber that is pressurized and filled with 100% oxygen. This high-pressure environment increases the amount of oxygen carried in solution within the blood, thereby delivering a significantly greater amount to tissues.Tibbles PM, Edelsberg JS. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. N Engl J Med 1996; 334:1642‚Äì8. HBOT has been shown to improve healing of infections in people, because it creates oxygen free radicals which damage bacterial DNA, elevates tissue oxygen levels which can be toxic to anaerobic bacteria,Knighton DR, Halliday B, Hunt TK. Oxygen as an antibiotic: the effect of inspired oxygen on infection. Arch Surg 1984; 119:199‚Äì204. and can increase antibiotic transfer into bacteria.Mader JT, Adams KR, Couch LA, et al. Potentiation of tobramycin by hyperbaric oxygen in experimental Pseudomonas aeruginosa osteomyelitis (Abstract 1331). Abstracts of the 27th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. Washington, DC, American Society for Microbiology 1987. HBOT has been shown to improve wound healing and is effective in treating ischemic tissue damage and compartment syndrome.Knighton DR, Silver IA, Hunt TK. Regulation of wound- healing angiogenesis‚Äîeffect of oxygen gradients and inspired oxygen concentration. Surgery 1981; 90:262‚Äì70.Zamboni WA, Roth AC, Russell RC, Graham B, Suchy H, Kucan JO. Morphological analysis of the microcirculation during reperfusion of ischaemic skeletal muscle and the effect of hyperbaric oxygen. Plastic Reconstr Surg 1993; 91:1110‚Äì23. Approved uses for HBOT in humans include clostridial myositis, crush injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, compartment syndrome, treatment for chronic wounds, osteomyelitis and abscesses, skin flaps or grafts, and burns. Despite the considerable use in human medicine, use in the horse is relatively new and few studies have been published on its benefits. Its effects have been shown to be quite transient in the horse, with arterial blood oxygen levels remaining elevated for only 10 minutes following treatment.Looijen, M. G. P. \\"Equine Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.\\" (2014). However, it has been used to treat various conditions, including infectious (fungal and bacterial, including cellulitis), carbon monoxide or smoke inhalation, neurologic disease (head injury, ‚Äúdummy foal‚Äù syndrome, and peripheral neuropathies), gastrointestinal disease (ileus), exertional rhabdomyolysis, and laminitis.Slovis N. Review of equine hyperbaric medicine. J Equine Vet Science 28:760-767, 2008. Some studies have discouraging results for its use. It has been shown to be detrimental to the viability of skin grafts in horses,Holder, Troy EC, et al. \\"Effects of hyperbaric oxygen on full-thickness meshed sheet skin grafts applied to fresh and granulating wounds in horses.\\" American journal of veterinary research 69.1 (2008): 144-147. and only minimal effects on horses with induced endotoxemia.Baumwart, Chad A., et al. \\"Effects of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on horses with experimentally induced endotoxemia.\\" American journal of veterinary research 72.9 (2011): 1266-1275. HBOT is considered very safe, with few contraindications, although its cost and availability make it less widely used than most other forms of treatment. Neurectomy Neurectomy refers to a surgical procedure in which a specific nerve is severed, thereby preventing sensation to a particular area. It is used when other methods of treatment have failed to reduce pain. In the United States, this procedure commonly refers to cutting of the palmar or plantar digital nerves to prevent sensation of the foot. It is often used to treat chronic foot pain, such as navicular syndrome, that is refractory to other methods of treatment. About 92% of horses respond to surgery, and one-third of horses develop postoperative complications, including neuroma formation, unresolved lameness, or early recurrence of lameness. The surgery is generally less successful when lameness is caused by injury to the deep digital flexor tendon, so magnetic resonance imaging is recommended to determine the cause of lameness prior to surgery to avoid performing a neurectomy in these horses. Neurectomy is also used to treat chronic hind limb suspensory ligament desmopathy. Suspensory injury, and the subsequent swelling of the ligament, is thought to produce a compartment syndrome that compresses the adjacent lateral plantar nerve, leading to inflammation of the nerve. This pressure can continue even after the ligament has healed, resulting in chronic pain. In this case, the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve is severed. The procedure has been shown to have good results in cases of chronic proximal suspensory desmitis of the hind limb (78% success rate), assuming the horse has no other musculoskeletal problems.Dyson, S., and R. Murray. \\"Management of hindlimb proximal suspensory desmopathy by neurectomy of the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve and plantar fasciotomy: 155 horses (2003‚Äì2008).\\" Equine Veterinary Journal 44.3 (2012): 361-367. Arthrodesis Arthrodesis is a procedure in which a joint is fused, either surgically or chemically. =Chemical arthrodesis= Chemical arthrodesis destroys the cartilage of the joint, producing ankylosis, and may also reduce pain immediately due to neurolysis. Often intra-articular injection of monoiodoacetate (MIA) or ethyl alcohol is used. Ethyl alcohol has several advantages over MIA, including decreased pain (MIA produces severe pain for several hours following injection), lower cost, and easy access. Chemical arthrodesis is commonly performed to treat osteoarthritis of the lower hock joints. These joints have little motion and can fuse without affecting the movement of the horse. Chemical arthrodesis has the potential to greatly improve chronic lameness which is not responding to IA anti- inflammatories, but carries the risk of severe complications, including joint sepsis, cellulitis, and severe lameness. Chemical arthrodesis is cheap, simple, and relatively noninvasive, but is potentially disastrous if the proximal intertarsal joint communicates with the high-motion tarsocrural joint. For this reason, a contrast study is often recommended prior to treatment to ensure no communication occurs between the two joints. Chemical arthrodesis has the potential to damage the joint cartilage without fusing the joint, leading to increased pain and lameness.Penraat, Jan H., et al. \\"An evaluation of chemical arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal joint in the horse by using monoiodoacetate.\\" Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research 64.4 (2000): 212. Chemical arthrodesis is less successful when used in the pastern joint, and often surgical arthrodesis is preferred.Watts A. Making Sense of Pastern Arthrodesis Approaches. Proc. ACVS (2012). =Surgical arthrodesis= Surgical arthrodesis may be produced by internal fixation, intra-articular drilling, intra-articular laser treatment (which damages chondrocytes), or surgical removal of joint cartilage to produce ankylosis.Jackman BR. Review of Equine Distal Hock Inflammation and Arthritis. Proc. AAEP, Vol 52:5-12 Surgical arthrodesis is used as a technique for treating pain in low-motion joints, such as the lower hock joints. When used in the lower hock joints, it has a high success rate for return to function, but is more expensive and invasive than chemical arthrodesis. Pastern osteoarthritis is also treated with surgical arthrodesis, and can lead to improved comfort and return to athletic function. Surgical arthrodesis may also be used in high-motion joints. Because it results in alteration of gait, the horse cannot be used for athletic pursuits following surgery. It is used as a salvaging procedure to save the horse with an injury that disrupts the stability of a joint, such as septic arthritis, failure of the suspensory apparatus, subluxation, fracture, or collateral ligament rupture, or may be used to treat chronic osteoarthritis. It is most commonly used to treat disease of the coffin, fetlock, carpal, and shoulder joints.Zubrod CJ, Schneider RK. Arthrodesis Techniques in Horses. Vet Clin Equine 21 (2005):691-711. Tenotomy and ligament desmotomy Transection of a soft tissue structure may be required to provide a horse with the best chance of regaining soundness. These procedures include the cutting of tendons (tenotomy) or ligaments (ligament desmotomy). =Deep digital flexor tendon tenotomy= The deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) runs down the back of the leg and attaches on the bottom surface of the coffin bone. Contraction of the deep digital flexor muscle will flex the digit. At rest, the DDFT applies a constant traction to the bottom surface of the coffin bone, which is counteracted by the laminae holding the coffin bone to the hoof wall. DDFT tenotomy is usually recommended in cases of laminitis and coffin bone rotation that is chronic or non-responsive to other forms of treatment. Transection of the DDFT reduces the pull on the bottom of the coffin bone, and subsequently decreases the stress placed on the laminae of the hoof. A horse will not be athletically useful following a DDFT tenotomy, with a best-case scenario of the animal returning to pasture soundness or possibly for comfortable enough for light pleasure riding. It is therefore considered a salvage procedure to improve the quality of life of the horse, often as final effort to avoid euthanasia.Eastman, T. G., et al. \\"Deep digital flexor tenotomy as a treatment for chronic laminitis in horses: 35 cases (1988-1997).\\" Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 214.4 (1999): 517-519. This procedure may be performed standing under local anesthesia. The DDFT is cut at the level of the mid-cannon or mid-pastern, although the mid-cannon is preferred to avoid the flexor tendon sheath. A DDFT tenotomy can also be used to treat severe cases of flexural limb deformity in foals, but it is also a salvage procedure and prevents the animal from any future athletic use. This procedure is quite painful and requires good analgesia in the days following surgery. Proper hoof trimming and shoeing is essential following surgery. The horse is at-risk of subluxation of the coffin joint, which may be counteracted by raising the heels of the horse. The toe may also lift off the ground when the horse weights its heels, which may be counteracted by adding heel extensions to the shoe. =Inferior check ligament desmotomy= The inferior check ligament, also known as the distal check ligament or accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon, runs from the palmar aspect of the knee to the deep digital flexor tendon approximately halfway down the length of the cannon bone. The main purpose of the ligament is to support and to prevent the over- extension of the deep digital flexor tendon. The inferior check ligament desmotomy transects the ligament to reduce the pull of the deep digital flexor tendon. Flexural limb deformity requires aggressive treatment to prevent permanent lameness. Inferior check ligament desmotomy is primarily used to treat flexural limb deformities secondary to deep digital flexor contracture. Contracture of the DDF forces the limb to maintain a constant flexed position in the fetlock and coffin joints, and if not corrected can be devastating to the athletic potential of an animal. Transection of the inferior check ligament reduces the pull of the DDF tendon, and allows the joints of the digit to their normal position. Check ligament desmotomy is considered superior to a deep digital flexor tenotomy because the animal has reduced pain and a greater chance of returning to full function following surgery. It has the greatest rate of success when contracture has not progressed to the point where the dorsal surface of the hoof wall is beyond vertical.McIlwraith, C. W., and J. F. Fessler. \\"Evaluation of inferior check ligament desmotomy for treatment of acquired flexor tendon contracture in the horse.\\" Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 172.3 (1978): 293-298. Horses treated at a young age (around 6 months old) have a better prognosis than those treated around 12 months of age.NA WHITE. \\"Ultrasound‚ÄêGuided Transection of the Accessory Ligament of the Deep Digital Flexor Muscle (Distal Check Ligament Desmotomy) in Horses.\\" Veterinary Surgery 24.5 (1995): 373-378. Like the DDFT tenotomy, the inferior check ligament desmotomy may also be used to treat laminitis, and is less aggressive than a DDFT tenotomy. It is also used to treat navicular syndrome that is thought to occur due to a broken-forward hoof axis, especially in cases of upright feet, and when DDFT contracture occurs secondary to chronic reduced weight-bearing on the limb. =Superior check ligament desmotomy= The superior check ligament, also known as the proximal check ligament or accessory ligament of the superficial digital flexor tendon, runs from distal aspect of the radius and inserts into the superficial digital flexor tendon just above the knee. It supports the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), helping to prevent over-stretching. The superior check ligament desmotomy transects the ligament to allow greater relaxation of the SDFT. This surgical procedure is used in cases of foals with flexural limb deformity secondary to contracture of the superficial digital flexor. It may be used in conjunction with an inferior check desmotomy if the DDFT is also contracted. Superior check ligament desmotomy is also used in cases of superficial digital flexor tendinitis in racehorses and upper level performance horses, if the tendinitis is recurrent, diffuse, or when the core lesion is >10% of the tendon cross-sectional area.Ross, MW. Surgical Management of Superficial Digital Flexor Tendinitis. Proc. AAEP 1997(43) 291-296. It may be used in conjunction with tendon splitting and annular ligament desmotomy. In racehorses with moderate to severe tendinitis of the SDFT, 69% returned to racing following a superior check ligament desmotomy, and were able to do so faster than horses that had not undergone the procedure.Hu, Alaine J., and Larry R. Bramlage. \\"Racing performance of Thoroughbreds with superficial digital flexor tendonitis treated with desmotomy of the accessory ligament of the superficial digital flexor tendon: 332 cases (1989‚Äì2003).\\" Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 244.12 (2014): 1441-1448. Unlike the inferior check ligament desmotomy, transection of the superior check ligament requires general anesthesia. =Palmar annular ligament desmotomy= The palmar annular ligament is located on the back of the fetlock, covering the SDFT and DDFT as they wrap around the joint. Injury to the flexor tendons leads to inflammation, edema, and secondary compression of the surrounding tissues, similar to carpal tunnel syndrome. This makes it more difficult for the SDFT to glide over the surface of the joint, and the palmar annular ligament may thicken and adhere to the tendon sheath or SDFT, further reducing function of the SDFT and worsening lameness. Transection of the palmar annular ligament aims to release the pressure placed on these soft-tissue structures. It is used in cases of SDFT or DDFT tendinitis, and in chronic tendosynovitis of the SDFT. It is most successful when used to treat tendinitis of the SDFT when paired with superficial ligament desmotomy. =Tendon splitting= Tendon splitting is used when a large core lesion exists within a tendon, which contains edema and damaged tissue. With ultrasound guidance, a needle or scalpel blade is inserted through the skin and into the lesion to drain it, reducing pressure on the injury and improving vascularization. Tendon splitting has been shown to reduce the size of the lesion and improve organization of fibers during healing.Henninger, Richard Warren, et al. \\"Effects of tendon splitting on experimentally-induced acute equine tendinitis.\\" Vet Comp Orthop Traumatol 5.1 (1992): 5-13. This technique is not appropriate for minor lesions, as it may worsen them, and is best performed within 2 weeks of injury. It thought to be more efficacious when combined with superficial check ligament desmotomy. Counterirritants Previous firing is evident on both front legs. Counterirritation is a collection of techniques used to promote inflammation, either through the use of a caustic substance or cautery, with the purpose of improving blood flow to an area of injury. Counterirritation has been used by horsemen for thousands of years, but its present-day use is controversial. Although practiced less commonly today, it is still considered a valid therapy by some practitioners, especially those on the racetrack. Thermocautery (pin firing) has been declared ‚Äúunethical‚Äù by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, although it is considered an acceptable therapy by the American Association of Equine Practitioners ‚Äúwhen applied judiciously and in conjunction with appropriate analgesia and aftercare‚Ä¶ in cases that have proven refractory to conventional treatment.‚Äù =Blistering= Blistering agents are chemical substances used to irritate tissues, leading to inflammation, increased circulation, necrosis, and scarring.Brown, Murray P., P. David Moon, and Claus D. Buergelt. \\"The effects of injection of an iodine counterirritant into the patellar ligaments of ponies: Application to stifle lameness.\\" Journal of Equine Veterinary Science 3.5 (1983): 149-153. They may be applied topically or injected. The most commonly used external (topical) blistering agents contain iodine, mercuric iodide, or turpentine, which are rubbed or brushed onto the skin overlaying the site of injury, and while they cause scaling of the skin, they tend to produce only low levels of soreness. Stronger blistering solutions may be made using red mercuric iodide. These require the use of a neck cradle, and the horse risks laminitis and lymphangitis if not walked regularly. Blistering is used for a variety of lameness problems, including splints, curbs, sore shins, tendonitis, suspensory desmitis, and sesamoiditis. Internal blistering is more common in the United States. Usually, a substance containing iodine or almond oil is injected into the site of interest to treat splints, curbs, and suspensory desmitis, with varying results. One of the more generally accepted uses for internal blistering is for treatment of upward fixation of the patella. The irritant is injected into the patellar ligaments, leading to inflammation and scarring. The scarred ligaments shorten, making it easier for the patella to slip off the medial trochlear ridge and reducing locking of the patella. =Firing= ‚ÄúFiring‚Äù, or thermal injury, includes thermocautery and cold firing. In both cases, firing is performed after the initial inflammation associated with the injury has subsided. The horse is sedated, and the area is clipped and blocked with a local anesthetic. The most common form of firing is ‚Äúpin firing‚Äù, which uses a specialized machine with a hot tip to penetrate through the skin and into the tendon or periosteum. Multiple applications are applied in rows over the site of injury. As expected, horses require analgesia following this procedure. Uses for pin firing include tendonitis, suspensory desmitis, sesamoiditis, splints, curbs, and other soft-tissue injuries. Cold firing is a method similar to pin firing, but uses liquid nitrogen to produce its effects. It is often used to treat lameness associated with the bone, such as sore shins or splints, and usually only after other treatments have failed. Firing forces rest of an injury, and while some argue this is the true reason it leads to any improvement of lameness, others contest that undeniable success in its use has been seen. Pin firing is not taught in veterinary schools in present day. Laminitis prevention Support-limb laminitis occurs in horses with a severe, unilateral lameness that causes them to not bear weight on one leg. The contralateral (opposite) leg then bears all of the weight, which reduces blood flow to the hoof and strains the attachments of the laminae, leading to laminitis. Although support-limb laminitis is a risk for any horse that is not weight-bearing lame, occurring in roughly 16% of cases, it is uncommon in foals and yearlings. It usually occurs weeks to months after the initial cause of lameness,Peloso, J.G., Cohen, N.D., Walker, M.A., Watkins, J.P., Gayle, J.M. and Moyer, W. (1996) Case-control study of risk factors for the development of laminitis in the contralateral limb in Equidae with unilateral lameness. J. Am. Vet. Med. Ass. 209, 1746-1749. and greatly increases the likelihood of euthanasia of the patient.Peloso, J. G., et al. \\"Case-control study of risk factors for the development of laminitis in the contralateral limb in Equidae with unilateral lameness.\\" Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 209.10 (1996): 1746-1749. Support-limb laminitis was the primary cause for euthanasia of the racehorse Barbaro. In cases of severe unilateral lameness, aggressive pain management using a combination of drugs in various classes such as opioids, alpha-2 agonists, ketamine, topical NSAIDs, and local anesthetics should be considered. Epidurals may also be helpful in hind limb lameness. Horses at risk for contralateral laminitis may be prophylactically treated with aggressive icing and supportive shoeing.Redden, RF. \\"Preventing laminitis in the contralateral limb of horses with nonweight-bearing lameness.\\" Clinical Techniques in Equine Practice 3.1 (2004): 57-63.

Lomonosov College of Electrical and Electronics was founded in 1959 by the engineer Marco Genchev, as a successor to the Technical College in Gorna Oryahovitsa. Initially, lessons were taught in the building of \\"Georgi Izmirliev\\" School and in Gorna Oryahovitsa. The first year of instruction began on 15 September 1959. Symbols of M.V.Lomonossov\`s school in Gorna Oryahovitsa Teachers were \\"specialized\\" in subjects such as mathematics, history and foreign languages. Over fifty percent of the teachers were engineers, from a variety of engineering disciplines, including electrical, power and radio technology. The planning and construction of a dedicated building complex began in 1960. In 1961, a meeting of the school committee chose a patron for their school. They chose Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov; in the 1962-1963 the official name of the school was M. V. Lomonosov School of Electricity (in Bulgarian:–¢–µ—Ö–Ω–∏–∫—É–º –ø–æ –µ–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏–∫e \\"–ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ –í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏–µ–≤–∏—á –õ–æ–º–æ–Ω–æ—Å–æ–≤\\" (–¢–ï–¢ \\"–í.–ú.–õ–æ–º–æ–Ω–æ—Å–æ–≤\\")). In 1965, the new building and park were finished. The building contained laboratories for radio, television, power electronics, and the study and applications of general electronics. The school had its own production center. Students took a role in manufacturing industrial solder, electric motors, radio antennas and other electronic items during their studies. Teacher of Bulgarian language and literature, Yordan Yordanov, composed the first school song. At the end of the 1960s, it had created professional relationships with other technical schools in Bulgaria and East Europe. The most thorough collaboration was with the School of Electrical in Odessa. In 1971 the northern portion of the school complex was completed. The construction included classrooms and further laboratories for technical studies. At that time the school offered were radio and television technology, electrical power, electrics and electrical machines. In 1973, a cinema was added, with seating for 500. From 1973 to 1974, the first cultural meeting exhibition occurred, showcasing student projects. From 1975 to 1976, a commemorative ceremony was held for the Bulgarian heroes of the April uprising. = School of Electrotechnics and Electronics = In 2001, the name of the school was changed to M. V. Lomonosov Professional High School of Electronics. Computer technologies, communications and computer networking were added to the school's curriculum in 2000. In 2006 the program added the Show of Electronics (, Shouto Na Zhuchka I Elektrichka).

Monument to Edith Cavell and Marie Depage in Brussels Marie Pauline Depage (n√©e Picard; 23 September 1872 ‚Äì 7 May 1915) was a Belgian nurse, and wife of Dr Antoine Depage. She was killed in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania, and she is commemorated in Belgium alongside the British nurse Edith Cavell. Early life She was born Marie Pauline Picard, in Ixelles near Brussels in Belgium, one of two daughters and two sons of the engineer D√©sir√© √âmile Picard and Julie Marie Victorine H√©ger. She was a niece of Professor Paul H√©ger and granddaughter of Constantin H√©ger. She married a Belgian doctor Antoine Depage on 8 August 1893. They had three sons. Her husband was a surgeon to the Belgian King Albert, and chairman of the Belgian Red Cross. He was also a founder of the International Society of Surgery (Societe internationale de chirurgie) in 1902. Depage showed talent in drawing and painting; after studying human anatomy, she drew illustrations of her husband's surgical work. Concerned at the antiquated nursing practice in Belgian hospitals run by nuns, Antoine Depage founded a laicised non- denominational medical institute in 1907, the Berkendael Medical Institute (also known as L'√âcole Belge d‚ÄôInfirmi√®res Dipl√¥m√©es), in Uccle near Brussels, with Edith Cavell as head nurse. Marie Depage took on the administrative work. The couple were also involved in the introduction of Baden-Powell's scouting movement into Belgium in 1909-10, and Marie translated and published several of Baden-Powell's books. War work With her husband and eldest son Pierre, also a surgeon, Depage organised sending four Belgian ambulances to the Balkans during the First Balkan War in 1912-13, accompanying the ambulance sent to a hospital in Constantinople. After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Depage volunteered at the Red Cross hospital established at the Royal Palace in Brussels, and then helped her husband to convert the Grand H√¥tel de l'Oc√©an at De Panne (also known in French as La Panne) into a Red Cross hospital for military casualties (see :fr: Grand H√¥tel de l'Oc√©an), and organised surgical units to treat wounded soldiers of the Belgian Army near the Yser Front. Depage travelled to the US in January 1915 to raise funds for the L'Oc√©an hospital. After raising $100,000 in a few weeks, she received news that her middle son Lucien would be joining her eldest son Pierre at the front, and decided to return to Belgium. She booked passage on the RMS Lusitania, leaving New York on 1 May 1915 for Liverpool via Queenstown in the south of Ireland. The ship was torpedoed by German submarine U-20 at about 2:10 pm on 7 May 1915, and rapidly sank. Depage assisted other passengers to board lifeboats, and treated some injured on the deck of the sinking vessel. As the ship sank, she became entangled in ropes and drowned, one of nearly 1,200 killed from almost 2,000 aboard. Depage's body was one of 289 recovered, and was buried by her husband in the sand dunes near La Panne. The funeral was attended by the King and Queen of the Belgians, Albert I and Elizabeth. Depage established the Institute Marie Depage near the Hospital de l'Ocean in her honour. A memorial by Belgian sculptor Paul Du Bois was erected at Uccle in 1920, to commemorate the deaths of Depage and Cavell in 1915. Cavell had been convicted of treason and executed by occupying German forces in October 1915. An inscription on the monument reads \\"Passant, dis-le √† tes enfants, ils les ont tu√©es\\" (French: \\"Passer-by, tell your children, they killed them\\"). The monument stands next to the Edith Cavell Hospital, at the intersection of Rue Edith Cavell and Rue Marie Depage.

It is used to prevent rabies following exposure. It is given after the wound is cleaned with soap and water or povidone-iodine and is followed by a course of rabies vaccine. It is given by injection into the site of the wound and into a muscle. It is not needed in people who have been previously vaccinated against rabies. Common side effects include pain at the site of injection, fever, and headache. Severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis may rarely occur. Use during pregnancy is not known to harm the baby. It works by binding to the rabies virus before it can enter nerve tissue. After the virus has entered the central nervous system, rabies immunoglobulin is no longer useful. The use of rabies immunoglobulin in the form of blood serum dates from 1891. Use became common within medicine in the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Rabies immunoglobulin is expensive and hard to come by in the developing world. In the United States it is estimated to be more than US$1,000.00 per dose. It is made from the blood plasma of people or horses who have high levels of the antibody in their blood. The horse version is less expensive but has a higher rate of side effects. Availability  There are three versions of rabies immunoglobulin licensed and available in the US. Imogam Rabies-HT is produced by Sanofi Pasteur. Kedrab is produced by Kedrion Biopharma. HyperRab is produced by Grifols. Imogam Rabies-HT and Kedrab have a nominal potency of 150 IU/mL while HyperRab has a nominal potency of 300 IU/mL and requires smaller dosing. All three versions are used for post-exposure and indicate local infusion at the wound site with additional amount intramuscularly at a site distant from vaccine administration.

On April 13, 1709, New France intendant Jacques Raudot passed the Ordinance Rendered on the Subject of the Negroes and the Savages Called Panis, legalizing the purchase and possession of indigenous slaves in New France. \\"Having good knowledge of how this colony would benefit if it were possible for the inhabitants to purchase slaves known as panis, whose nation is Distant from this country [...] We for the great pleasure of his Majesty, ordain that all Panis and Negroes who have been purchased or who will be purchased at some time, will belong to Those who have purchased them.\\"Archives nationales du Qu√©bec, Centre de Qu√©bec, Ordonnances des intendants, E1, S1, P509, Raudot, Jacques, Ordinance relative to slavery in Canada, April 13, 1709 Context When Raudot pronounced indigenous slavery to be legal in New France, the practice had already been well established in the Native and French alliances throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In all of the Indigenous societies the French encountered in North America, the basis of social relationships was kinship. This system allowed for alliances to transcend ethnic and linguistic lines, thereby explaining early Franco-Native relationships.Donald, Leland. \\"Slavery in Indigenous North America\\", The Cambridge World History of Slavery. Ed. David Eltis and Stanley L. Engerman. 1st ed. Vol. 3. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. pp. 217-247. Cambridge Histories Online. Web. 25 February 2015. , 218 Indigenous slavery prior to contact with Europeans took the form of captivity raids on enemy territory with an objective to kill or capture members of the enemy nation‚Äîusually men were killed, while women and children were taken captive.Donald 218 Among the Northeastern communities, the death of a kin member decreased the spiritual power of the community. In order to reestablish spiritual balance, members of enemy nations would be taken captive, then either killed or adopted and made slaves.Donald 220 Captives who escaped death but were not adopted into their captors‚Äô community, were then used as instruments of diplomacy.Rushforth, Brett. Bonds of Alliance: Indigenous and Atlantic Slaveries in New France. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2012. 70 In contrast to European slavery, the Indigenous practice focused more on the act of enslavement itself than on the production of commodities. In Bonds of Alliance, historian Brett Rushforth argues that Indigenous slavery was: ‚Äúat its heart a system of symbiotic dominion, appropriating the power and productivity of enemies and facilitating the creation of friendships built on shared animosity toward the captive‚Äôs people\\".Rushforth 71 Thus, Indigenous slavery was part of a much larger social phenomena that focused more on the symbolic display of power and the building of alliances, than on the economic value of the labour. At the turn of the eighteenth century, New France's major export was fur, which was, historian James Pritchard argues, obtained through ‚Äúa symbiotic relationship between native hunters and French traders‚Äù which ‚Äúgave rise to a set of socioeconomic and politicomilitary relations in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that became unique in the Western Hemisphere\\".Pritchard, James S. In Search of Empire: The French in the Americas, 1670-1730. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 151 These relations, coupled with a dogged westward drive towards the Pays d'en Haut, resulted in the French involvement in the Indigenous slave trade\\".Rushforth 142 When Raudot published the 1709 ordinance, Indigenous slavery in New France had been playing an active role in mediating and consolidating Indigenous alliances, as well as meeting the settler demand for slave labour as pronounced by Raudot‚Äî‚Äúthe people of the Panis nation are needed by the inhabitants of this country for agriculture and other enterprises that might be undertaken, like Negroes in the Islands, and as these bonds are very important to this colony, it is necessary to guarantee ownership to those who have bought or will buy them‚Äù.Rushforth, 395 It is within this context of economic crisis driven by the decreasing price of fur in the French market and a growing state debt that Raudot looked towards the Lesser Antilles‚Äî‚ÄúThe demographic and economic heart of French America‚Äù‚Äîfor economic inspiration.Dech√™ne, Louise. Habitants and Merchants in Seventeenth- Century Montreal. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1993. Hoping to recreate a plantation style economy in New France, while responding to the inevitable inflow of Indigenous slaves from their Native allies, Raudot thereby confirmed the legality of Indigenous slavery in New France in the 1709 Ordinance.Pritchard, James S. In Search of Empire: The French in the Americas, 1670-1730. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. =After the Ordinance= After the 1709 Ordinance came into effect, slavery in the colony grew exponentially. Natives flooded the slave market in the course of intense diplomacy with the French to prevent colonial encroachment of Native land.Rushforth 179 Therefore, the flood of Native slaves in the St. Lawrence largely came from their Western counterparts. According to Rushforth, ‚Äúby narrowing the target to a specific set of victims known as the ‚ÄòPanis nation,‚Äô Raudot and his successors created a North American counterpart to the African kingdom of Nigritie: a distant and populous nation at war with more proximate allies, poorly understood but clearly identified as legally and morally enslavable\\".Rushforth 165 Effectively, this meant Western Natives were strengthening future adversaries in the east, with their own slaves, in a struggle to preserve their land.

The story is written from the view of a young British girl, Vinny, whose friend almost becomes a victim of Forced Marriage. The book is presented in a chatty and easy-to-read style, but it carries some powerful messages. It not only raises awareness of Forced Marriage and highlights some of the key signs associated with Forced Marriage, but it also suggests courses of action that could help potential victims. Freedom Charity distributes copies of \\"But It's Not Fair\\" free to schools, alongside lesson plans for teachers. The newest novel \\"Cut Flowers\\" is about female genital mutilation FGM. Katie and Sophia are just two ordinary girls eagerly awaiting the summer holidays until their teacher, Miss Adams, gives them their summer homework ‚Äì to prepare a presentation about what they did over the holidays. Little did they know that it would be the start of a lifelong mission to protect young girls all over the world.

He married Katie Elizabeth Drew of Minden in nearby Webster Parish. Background Carey was one of three sons and one daughter born to attorney Gregory William Carey (1882-1965) and the former Willie Belle Locke (1885-1941). Though he was born in Parkin in Cross County in eastern Arkansas, Carey was living at the age of five, according to the 1920 census, in Earle in Crittenden County, also in eastern Arkansas. He was subsequently reared in Paris in Logan County in the western portion of the state. At Paris High School, from which he graduated in 1931, he excelled in football and was a Golden Gloves champion in boxing. In 1930 he was Arkansas Welterweight Champion and later in that year he won a Chicago Tourney of Champions Welterweight title. In 1931 as a middleweight, he again won.Galphibian, 1 June1945: volume 1, number 11 He spent time during summers in a government WPA work camp in Kansas at his father's insistence to learn the value of hard work and persistence. Gregory and Willie Carey are interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Paris, Arkansas. Carey's older brother, PFC William Gregory Carey, was killed in action aboard the HMT Rohna, in the greatest loss of life, at sea, for the American military in World War II. In 1932, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled for two years at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He was a member of the University of Arkansas Football team. In January 1933 Carey wed before a justice of the peace in Stilwell in Adair County in eastern Oklahoma the former Katie Elizabeth Drew (1915-1971), the daughter of Harmon Caldwell Drew, judge of the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit, and the former Annie Lucile Grigsby (1890-1974). In 1951, Katie Drew Carey became a real estate agent in her native Minden, Louisiana.\\"Katie Drew Carey Licensed in Minden since 1951\\", Minden Press-Herald, April 28, 1970, p. 2C Harvey Carey was thereafter engaged in pre-law studies at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston from 1934 to 1936. In December 1934, the young couple's first son, Richard Drew Carey (1934-2013), was born in Shreveport. Early legal career A member of the moot court, Carey obtained his law degree in 1939 from Tulane in New Orleans. He was affiliated with Phi Delta Phi honor society and the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.Carey's biography is also available at Marquis Who's Who in America on-line. After law school, Carey joined the prestigious Shreveport firm of Hollingsworth B. Barret (1892-1959). While working subsequently for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, he acquired through the use of eminent domain the land for Wallace Lake Reservoir on Cypress Bayou near Stonewall in south Caddo Parish and the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant west of Minden, which was activated for World War II ordnance manufacturing. Military matters In 1942, at the age of twenty-seven, Carey enrolled in Officer Candidate School for the United States Navy at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. While in the Navy, he studied in 1943 at Princeton University in Princeton. He was the first commanding officer of LCI 466, this being from 22 September 1943 until 16 October 1943. For severe injuries sustained during maneuvers off Chesapeake Bay, Carey received the Purple Heart. For six months he recuperated at Bethesda Naval Medical Center. During 1944 and 1945, as a lieutenant he was executive officer of the Navy's amphibious training base at Galveston, Texas. His last military assignment was as a legal officer on the Pacific island of Guam in the Marianas Islands. In preparation for the 1945 flight of the Enola Gay over Hiroshima, Paul Tibbets spent time on Guam and on nearby Tinian at the same time that Carey was stationed in Guam. Carey is listed as a department commander in this undated certificate from the Military Order of the Purple Heart, of which he was three times a state commander and once a national vice-commander. A brother, Private First Class William Gregory \\"Bill\\" Carey (1913-1943) of Paris, Arkansas, was one of 1,045 Americans killed at sea in the sinking in the Mediterranean Sea of the HMT Rohna. After his active military service, Carey was a lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve. Carey was long active in the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans. He was commander of the Shreveport contingent of the congressional-chartered Military Order of the Purple Heart, which disbanded after the death of all its members. For three years during the 1950s, he was the MOPH state commander; for a year he was a national MOPH vice-commander. Law and politics Carey (right) confers in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Senator Russell B. Long, whose 1948 campaign in northwestern Louisiana Carey managed. After the war, Carey became an oil and natural gas attorney in Shreveport; one of his principal clients was William C. Feazel, the interim U.S. senator appointed in May 1948 upon the death of John H. Overton. Late in 1947 and early in 1948, Carey was the northwestern Louisiana campaign manager to return Earl Kemp Long to the governorship for his first full term to a position which then paid $12,000 per year. In a runoff election, Long handily defeated former Governor Sam H. Jones of Lake Charles to succeed the first of the two terms of Jimmie Davis. Later in the same year, Carey and former State Senator Lloyd Hendrick of Shreveport ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 4th congressional district. The pair was defeated by the popular incumbent Overton Brooks of Shreveport, a nephew of John Overton, who subsequently died in office in 1961. In the 1948 fall campaign, as a member of the Caddo Parish Democratic Executive Committee, Carey worked unsuccessfully to carry Louisiana's then ten electoral votes for U.S. President Harry S. Truman, who lost the state to the official Democratic nominee, Strom Thurmond, then the governor of South Carolina. He also worked successfully in Russell B. Long's northwest Louisiana general election campaign for a partial term in the U. S. Senate against the Republican Clem S. Clarke, a Shreveport oilman. Carey's support for the Longs was in contrast to the stand of his father-in-law, Judge Harmon Caldwell Drew, who had spoken out against Huey Pierce Long, Jr., in a public meeting in Minden in 1933. Drew was the president of the interest group known as the Louisiana New Deal Organization, an association committed to promoting the New Deal domestic policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

She was active as a spy and diplomat in Sweden. She was born to count Wilhelm Moritz Heinrich von Ludolf, Ambassador of Naples in Constantinople, and Catherine Chabert, and married the ambassador of France, Fran√ßois-Emmanuel Guignard, comte de Saint-Priest, in October 1774. During the French revolution, the couple left for Sweden, where they participated in high society. In the summer of 1794, they were banned from the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace, as it had become known that they were given an allowance from Catherine the Great and assumed to be dangerous Russian spies. In the spring of 1796, the movement of Russian troops along the Finnish border gave rise to suspicions in Sweden that Russia was preparing war because of the discontent of Catherine the Great that Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden had been engaged to Duchess Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin instead of Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia. The Swedish government of Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm tried to negotiate with the Russian ambassador to Stockholm, Andrei Budberg, but without success. Constance Wilhelmine de Saint-Priest, known for her Russian connections, was thereby assigned through the Spanish ambassador to issue negotiations with Budberg and convince him to agree to informal negotiations with a representative. She succeeded, and Budberg med with Hans Henric von Essen at her apartment. The negotiations were successful. When Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden left for Russia for his engagement with Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia later that year, de Saint-Priest implied that it was due to her intermission that Sweden and Russia had agreed to avoid war through a marriage alliance. Constance Wilhelmine de Saint-Priest was rewarded by Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm by being admitted to court again and by having a position at court secured for her current lover Aminoff. She died in Stockholm. See also *Camille du Bois de la Motte, another contemporary Frenchwoman active as a spy and diplomat in Sweden References * Hedvig Elisabeth Charlottas dagbok IV. 1793-1794.

In 1860, the people of ≈ªebbuƒ° started collecting money which would enable them to order the titular statue which they wanted. The collection was so great that it was decided to build the statue in silver instead of the more usual wood. The statue was completed in 1864, by Luigi Fontana.

Luca Garnier painted the titular painting above the high altar. It depicts St Philip of Agira performing a miracle while holding a cross towards a possessed man who is brought before him.

Formerly called Kidney Island, it is 55 acres constructed in 1977 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a disposal site for dredged materials taken from the Fox River and Green Bay harbor entrance channel. The dredged material is contaminated with Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) that are known probable carcinogens to humans, as well as large amounts of furans, dioxins, mercury, lead, pentachlorophenol, and hundreds of other persistent toxic chemicals which cause serious health concerns for fish, wildlife, and humans.http://www.wsn.org/cwac/kidney.html Many of the chemicals, like mercury and lead, will never break down. Renard Isle hit its designed capacity to hold contaminated materials around 1993.  History  The lower Fox River in Green Bay, WI became a popular site for paper mills in the late 19th century, which slowly contributed to the bulk of pollution of the Fox River. During the mid 20th century, paper mills producing a PCB containing carbonless copy-paper began contaminating the waters. It is estimated that \\"between 1957 and 1971, 250,000 pounds of PCBs were released, contaminating 11 million tons of sediment\\" in and around the Fox River.http://www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/foxriver/background.htm Since the channel in the lower Fox River and Green Bay harbor entrance needed to be maintained to provide a suitable depth for ship traffic, dredging is done to remove sediment at the bottom. And since that sediment is contaminated with PCBs that do not naturally biodegrade, Renard Isle was constructed to house those dredge spoils.https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeologyWisconsin/geostops/renardis.htm The man-made structure holds approximately 2.7 million cubic yards of contaminated dredgings.http://archive.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20080212/GPG0101/802120516/Possible- causeway-Renard-Isle-studied Since 2010, the U.S. Army Corps has spent upwards of $4 million to cap the island and restore it to be suitable for recreational use.

Coincidentally, the federal government budgeted $2,500,000 for the project.http://whbl.com/news/articles/2010/oct/06/green-bay-area-firms-angry- about-losing-renard-isl/ Currently, the causeway to connect Renard Isle to the mainland for recreational use has not yet commenced due to a governmental dispute between Brown County and the city of Green Bay over an existing 16 foot wide road which would become a permanent easement to access the causeway. Brown County is pushing for its conversion into a permanent easement, while the city of Green Bay does not want to give up the land due to its location adjacent to Bay Beach Amusement Park.http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/2015/02/25/city- county-dispute-threatens-renard-isle-access/24033453/ References Category:Green Bay, Wisconsin ","title":"Renard Isle"},{"id":"45518229","text":"Agafon () is a Russian Christian male first name.Superanskaya [1], p. 24 The name is derived from the Greek word agathon, meaning kindness, goodness.

The result was a first-round victory for incumbent President Alpha Cond√©, who received 58% of the vote. Background In December 2013, the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa that began in Guinea spread to neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia, as well as with health workers and visitors who returned to their respective countries. At the time of the elections the worst of the epidemic was over, although there were still a lesser number of prevalent cases.Guinea Holds Tense Vote Despite Opposition Mistrust, NDTV, 11 October 2015 The seven opposition parties called for a postponement,\\"Guinean opposition calls for postponement of presidential polls\\", Xinhua, 7 October 2015. citing alleged irregularities in the electoral roll, but their pleas were rejected by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI). Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG) also petitioned the Supreme Court of Guinea to have the election postponed, but it was rejected. Electoral system The elections were held using the two-round system, with a second round taking place if no candidate received more than 50% of the vote in the first round.Republic of Guinea IFES Presidents are limited to two terms in office, allowing incumbent president Alpha Cond√© to run for a second term. Campaign A total of eight candidates contested the elections;Guineans vote in presidential poll amid tension BBC News, 11 November 2015 including incumbent Cond√©, Diallo, who was named as the candidate of the UFDG on 25 July 2015,\\"Guinea's former PM to run for presidency in October\\", AFP, 25 July 2015. Sidya Tour√© of the Union of Republican Forces, Papa Koly Kourouma of the Generations for Reconciliation, Union, and Prosperity party, Georges Gandhi Faraguet of the Guinean Union for Democracy and Development, Faya Millimouno of the Liberal Bloc, Marie Madeleine Dioubat√© of the Guinea Ecologists Party and Lansana Kouyat√© of the National Party for Hope and Development. During the campaign Cond√© told voters that he aimed to promote development and consolidate stability. Diallo promised to give priority to youth employment, as well as \\"access to health care, decent housing, water, electricity, safety, and justice\\". His campaign slogan promised to deliver a \\"KO blow\\" to his opponents. He cited his record on overhauling the army and judiciary, the completion of a hydroelectric dam and reforms in making the mineral-rich country's mining contracts more transparent. He said in an interview: \\"Ask the people of Guinea if what we have done in five years, the others did in 50. Ask that on the streets.\\" His campaign was said to benefit from improving supply of electricity in Conakry and the relative stability the country endured despite the Ebola epidemic. Diallo called on voters to make their voices heard following the rejection of his plea for a delay of the \\"imperfect\\" process. \\"We will vote, defend our suffrage, defend our victory because there is no way we will let our victory be stolen.\\" Prior to the vote, all seven opponents of the incumbent said they would challenge the outcome. A joint statement read: \\"The seven candidates will not recognise the results which will be made following an election with anomalies and irregularities.\\" Conduct Violence during the election campaign, including clashes between supporters of Cond√© and Diallo in Koundara, led to the deaths of at least three people. A curfew was put in place in Nz√©r√©kor√© after one person was killed and dozens injured during a visit by Cond√© on 5 October.Will Guinea election be free and fair? BBC News, 8 October 2015 United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon then called for the vote to be \\"conducted in a peaceful and transparent manner.\\" Voting centres were open from 7:00 until 18:00, while national borders were closed for the day and traffic restricted to that of electoral observers, government officials and security forces, in accordance with a presidential decree. Around 19,000 police and members of the security services were on duty. Cond√© also declared that over 90% of voter cards had been distributed. Monitors included an African Union observer mission and a 72-member European Union delegation. The EU delegation cited ‚Äúmassive deficiencies‚Äù ahead of polling; however, in its post-election report it concluded that the process overall was ‚Äúvalid‚Äù. Results Reactions After CENI head Bakary Fofana announced there would be no run-off, Diallo and Tour√© alleged fraud and said they would not recognise the result.

The episode was written by Corey Reed and directed by David Boyd. The events of the episode adapt material from \\"Volume 12\\", \\"Issue #72\\" of the comic book series. In the episode, Rick and the others try to settle in with the community of Alexandria at Deanna Monroe's party. However, some of the characters are unable to adjust to new life after their struggles on the road such as Sasha Williams, who has PTSD over her losses. Meanwhile, Carol Peletier devises a plan to steal back the group's weapons undercover. This episode marks the first appearance of Spencer Monroe, portrayed by Austin Nichols, a prominent character from the graphic novels. It also features the introductions of Tobin, a member of the construction crew from the graphic novels. \\"Forget\\" also marks the final appearance of Beth Greene (Emily Kinney) and Tyreese Williams (Chad L. Coleman), who appear briefly in a flashback to Sasha. The episode received positive acclaim, with many praising the continuing Alexandria Safe-Zone story arc. Plot Sasha Williams (Sonequa Martin-Green) wakes up and glances at several family portraits left behind in her new house. Later that day, she takes them outside the walls to use as target practice. Finally she sits down on a tree stump, quietly saying to the walkers, \\"Come and get me.\\" In the woods, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), and Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) start scheming to steal back their weapons. A walker creeps up on them, which Carol shoots multiple times before finally killing it, to make it seem like they were practicing. The trio notices the letter \\"W\\" carved in the walker's forehead. Back at Rick's house, he and Michonne (Danai Gurira) discuss the reasons why they have been made town constables and wonder if it's part of a larger plan. Elsewhere in the woods, Daryl catches Aaron (Ross Marquand) following him, and together they go hunting when they come across a black horse Aaron calls Buttons which he has been trying to catch for months. The horse is spooked away by some walkers, and others later corner and attack it. Aaron and Daryl kill the walkers, and Aaron regretfully puts down the mortally wounded horse. Meanwhile, Deanna Monroe (Tovah Feldshuh) explains a bit more about Rick and Michonne's job securing the community. She explains that Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) will be helping her with politics and her vision is that one day the community will have a government. Outside, Deanna tells Rick she cannot have everyone walking around with guns. Sasha approaches them, saying she wants to man the clock tower with her rifle and displays her eagerness to have as \\"many shifts as possible\\" in the tower; Rick endorses Sasha as his group's sniper but Deanna rejects it. That night, Deanna throws a welcoming party for the group and invites the entire community. The group has trouble adjusting to their new surroundings: Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) and Michonne discuss the difficulty of leaving behind the road and its dangers, and Sasha has flashbacks of her recent traumas and storms out after an outburst. Rick meets Jessie's son, Sam (Major Dodson), and later gives Jessie a kiss on the cheek. Daryl skips the party, so Aaron invites him to dinner along with Eric (Jordan Woods-Robinson), and shows Daryl their garage full of old motorcycle parts. Aaron tells Daryl that he will need to construct a bike because Aaron wants him to replace Eric as a recruiter for Alexandria. While the party is underway, Carol, having already unlatched a window, sneaks into the storeroom where the guns are being held and takes three pistols from a bin as well as a small chocolate ration. Jessie's son Sam catches her and says he will tell his mother what he saw. Carol persuades him to remain silent with the promise of cookies, and a threat of tying him to a tree for walkers to eat if he breaks his silence. At their meeting spot in the woods, Carol hands both Rick and Daryl a revolver, but Daryl refuses. Rick goes for a walk in Alexandria, where he sees Jessie and her husband, Pete Anderson (Corey Brill), and briefly reaches towards his revolver. He hears a noise from outside the wall and runs in its direction, where a lone walker is banging on it from the other side. Rick puts his hand on the wall and appears to take some satisfaction in reconnecting with the animalistic life outside the walls. Production The episode was written by Corey Reed and directed by David Boyd. It marks the final overall appearances of Emily Kinney as Beth Greene and Chad L. Coleman as Tyreese Williams in a flashback sequence. Lawrence Gilliard Jr. briefly appears as Bob Stookey but he remains uncredited. Guest appearances include Tovah Feldshuh as Deanna Monroe, Tyler James Williams as Noah, Alexandra Breckenridge as Jessie Anderson. \\"Forget\\" adapts material from \\"Volume 13: Too Far Gone\\" in Robert Kirkman's source material. Differences within the episode include Carol Peletier substituting Glenn Rhee in stealing the guns back, Sasha Williams' outburst substituting Michonne's and Daryl Dixon refusing the stolen guns instead of Andrea. Jessie cutting Rick's hair instead of Olivia. Sasha also obtains Andrea's marksmanship role within the safe-zone on the look-out tower. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 14.534 million American viewers with an 18-49 rating of 7.3, an increase in viewership from the previous episode which had 14.43 million viewers, and a slight decrease in 18-49 ratings from the previous episode's 7.5. The Australian broadcast was watched by 86,000 viewers, making it the seventh most-watched broadcast on pay television that day. In New Zealand, it was the fifth highest-rated timeshifted broadcast, with 33,330 viewers. =Critical reception= Austin Nichols made his first appearance as Spencer Monroe in this episode. The episode received positive reviews, with most attention going to the storylines involving Carol and Sasha. Matt Fowler of IGN gave \\"Forget\\" an 8.6 out of 10, and wrote positively about Carol's intimidation of the young boy, Daryl's storyline with Aaron, and Sasha's actions in the episode. He concluded, \\"So even though there's no imminent threat at the moment, things within Alexandria are still really intriguing.\\" Sean McKenna for TV Fanatic spoke positively about the episode, saying he \\"didn't disagree with Sasha's feelings [towards Alexandria]\\" and noted Carol's scene with Sam as the highlight of the episode saying: \\"But man, did Carol take the cake when she went super dark on that kid threatening to feed him to the walkers if he told his mom that she was grabbing the guns. What an intense scene that perhaps, if I hadn‚Äôt been watching The Walking Dead up until now, might have thought she was one of the bad guys on the show.\\" Shane Ryan for Paste Magazine positively reviewed the episode. He compared Sasha to Charles Whitman and felt that she should be kept away from the tower completely and said the scene involving Carol and Sam was \\"disturbing.\\" In further detail he said: \\"That scene was so strange and memorable that it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôve been watching a fake Carol all these years, and we just saw her bona fide psychopath interior seep to the surface. Somehow, even killing those sick people at the prison didn‚Äôt seem quite so bad‚Äîat least there was a twisted logic there.\\" Tim Surette for TV.com said \\"Carol, you continue to amaze me and I am really close to asking you to prom.\\" Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Paul Vigna praised the episode and said it had \\"wonderful, subtle touches, things to savor, and understated but confident storytelling, from watching the Grimes clan try to fit into a cocktail party to Daryl and Aaron‚Äôs bonding through a walker-hunting spree.\\" He also praised Melissa McBride as Carol saying: \\"What Melissa McBride is doing with Mrs. Peletier, with Carol fooling everybody with this den-mom Junior League act, is simply delicious. The whole thing was a fantastic change of pace.\\" He praised Daryl and Aaron's bond and was sympathetic towards Sasha, calling her situation a \\"sad story\\". Patrick Kevan Day for the Los Angeles Times was complimentary of the episode, and felt that Rick set the table for \\"screwing the entire place up\\". He compared the show to the ABC television series, Lost saying: \\"seeing our band of survivors cleaned up and wearing Saturday-afternoon suburban duds in a halfway civilized setting brought back intense Lost and The Others flashbacks. Perhaps intentional, perhaps coincidental, but it does seem that The Walking Dead writers are enjoying playing with our expectations of the residents of Alexandria.\\" He also considered Sasha's problem to be fixable, and called Rick the \\"real problem\\". Ron Hogan for Den of Geek! felt that Sasha's breakdown at the party of Alexandria served as the episode's highlight. He said: \\"A few days ago, she was eating beans out of a can; now she's at a dinner party with people eating potato puffs off little plastic swords and drinking beer like there's nothing happening just beyond those corrugated steel walls. But there is. Sasha knows this, and Sonequa Martin-Green plays this perfectly.\\" He went further to say, \\"I understand what she's going through completely, and her lashing out makes perfect sense, both in ferocity and in timing.\\" He also felt that the direction complimented Martin-Green's performance. Alan Sepinwall for HitFix was positive towards the episode. He said: \\"This is some ugly stuff ‚Äî the Carol/Sam scene was one of the show's most uncomfortable scenes ever that didn't involve a zombie makeup effect ‚Äî and has breathed a ton of life into the show after that bumpy start to this half-season. Where Hershel's farm and even the prison felt like places where the series overstayed their welcome for budgetary reasons, this new/old world feels rich and complicated enough that I could see a very long and creatively healthy stretch here, as the arrogance of Rick, the paranoia of Carol, the PTSD of Sasha, etc., slowly causes this paradise to crumble around them.\\" References External links *\\"Forget\\" at AMC * * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 5) episodes ","title":"Forget (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"45518262","text":"This is a list of Swedish television related events from 2007.

An algorithm with a higher klam value can be used for a wider range of parameter values than another algorithm with a lower klam value. The klam value was first defined by ,. uses the klam value and was published earlier than , but gives credit to Downey and Fellows for the concept. and has since been used by other researchers in parameterized complexity both as a way of comparing different algorithms to each other and in order to set goals for future algorithmic improvements. Definition An algorithm is said to be fixed-parameter tractable if the number of elementary operations it performs has a bound of the form O(n^c)+f(k), where n is some measure of the input size (such as the number of vertices in a graph), k is a parameter describing the complexity of the input (such as the treewidth of the graph), c is a constant that does not depend on n or k, and f is a computable function. Given a time bound of this form, the klam value of the algorithm (or more properly of the time bound) is defined to be the largest value of k such that f(k) does not exceed \\"some reasonable absolute bound on the maximum number of steps of any computation\\". More precisely both and use the number 1020 as this bound, and this has been followed by later researchers. To prevent artificially improving the klam value of an algorithm by putting more of its complexity into the O(n^c) part of the time bound, also limit c to be at most three, valid for many known fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. Examples cites the example of vertex cover, with its natural parameter (the number of vertices in the cover). At that time the best known parameterized time bound had f(k)=O(k^2 1.3248^k). Solving k^2 1.3248^k=10^{20} gives a klam value of approximately 129. However, the k^2 part of the time bound can be simplified out of it, giving a bound of the form O(1.3248^k) with both a larger constant factor hidden in the O-notation and a larger base of the exponent hidden in its approximate decimal value. For a simple exponential bound f(k)=c^ksuch as this one, one can solve directly k=20/\\\\log_{10} c from which Niedermeier derives a klam value of approximately 165. Subsequent research has developed parameterized vertex cover algorithms with f(k)=O(1.2738^k). giving a klam value of approximately 190. That is, one can conclude from this analysis that vertex cover instances with cover size greater than 190 are out of reach of this algorithm, but instances whose cover size is sufficiently far below this limit are likely to be solvable. Another example of a problem in which the klam value has been explicitly used as a goal for future research is the maximum leaf spanning tree problem, in which the goal is to find a spanning tree of a graph with as many leaf nodes as possible (parameterized by the number of leaves). develop an algorithm for this problem which they compare using the klam value to previous work on the same problem: previous algorithms had klam values of 1 and 5, and theirs has a klam value of 16.. However, they also suggest that it should be possible to provide improved algorithms for this problem with a klam value of at least 50. Although this remains open, several later papers have incrementally improved the klam value of this problem to 37..

Early on in a company's life cycle (particularly with internet investments), companies can demand high valuations despite little or negative earnings. When the company breaks even, its valuation seems inflated from a relative valuation standpoint (market value divided by the company's earnings, EBITDA, or cash flow). Over time as the earnings power grows, the relative valuation begins to fall as earnings often growth faster than the market value (stock price).Higson, Chris, and John Briginshaw. \\"Valuing Internet Business.\\" Business Strategy Review 11.1 (2000): 10-20.

The Growth X is commonly used among growth and venture capital investors, and is believed to be coined by Spencer Walsh and Vidur Singhal, two prominent Silicon Valley internet investors. Much like other technical indicators, The Growth X is often disputed and depends on a company's ability to continually grow earnings. If investors bid up the market value of the company faster than the earnings growth rate, then The Growth X will not form, and the relative valuation will stay flat or continue to rise. Eventually relative valuations fall as growth prospects diminish, but this can often occur quickly and cause a step function down in valuation multiples.

Background  In September 2003, the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority and the Portland Hotel Society opened Insite, North America's first supervised drug injection site, in Downtown Eastside Vancouver, an area racked by high drug use. s 4(1) and 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) prohibited the possession and trafficking of controlled substances, and so in order to operate, Insite was obligated to apply for an exemption for medical and scientific purposes from the CDSA. The federal Minister of Health, whose discretionary powers under s 56 of the CDSA permitted the granting of exemptions, allowed Insite's application. Insite received further extensions on their exemption in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, Minister of Health Tony Clement failed to extend the exemption, casting doubt on Insite's ability to operate the facility in the future. In response, Insite launched a court challenge against the federal government.  The courts below  At trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Insite argued that s 4(1) and 5(1) of the CDSA were inapplicable to Insite because of the interjurisdictional immunity granted them as a health facility. Insite argued that applying the CDSA provisions to their facility in the absence of an exemption would violate their s 7 rights upon application. In the alternative, Insite argued that the Minister of Health had violated their s 7 rights by failing to extend the exemption. The trial judge rejected Insite's interjurisdictional immunity argument, noting instead the primacy of double aspect in Canadian constitutional law. However, the trial judge found that s 4(1) and 5(1) of the CDSA violated Insite's s 7 Charter rights because they \\"arbitrarily prohibited the management of addiction and its associated risks\\",SCC, par. 31 and they could not be saved by s 1 of the Charter. The trial judge thus granted Insite a constitutional exemption and issued a suspended declaration of invalidity regarding s 4(1) and 5(1) of the CDSA.SCC, par. 31 Upon appeal by the federal government to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the majority of the court affirmed the trial judge's decision, agreeing with the result of the trial judge's Charter and interjurisdictional immunity analyses.SCC, par. 32‚Äì35  Decision of the Supreme Court  The court unanimously dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal on the basis of a s 7 argument, although it found no division of powers flaw in the CDSA. = Division of powers = The court found that s 4(1) and 5(1) of the CDSA were valid exercises of the federal law criminal power, per R v Malmo-Levine, where the court held that \\"protection of public health and safety from the effects of addictive drugs is a valid criminal law purpose\\".SCC, par. 52 The court rejected the respondents' argument that the provinces could be exempt from the federal criminal law power if they established an activity serving the public interest.SCC, par. 53‚Äì56 The court ruled also that interjurisdictional immunity could not shield the provinces from the federal criminal law power, given the narrowing of that doctrine in the Supreme Court's ruling in Canadian Western Bank v Alberta. This restraint arises from the SCC's 2010 ruling in Quebec (AG) v Canadian Owners and Pilots Assn, where three related concerns were identified with the doctrine: #it is in tension with the dual aspect doctrine,SCC, par. 61 #it is in tension with the emergent practice of cooperative federalism,SCC, par. 62 and #it may overshoot the federal or provincial power in which it is grounded and create legislative \\"no go\\" zones where neither level of government regulates.SCC, par. 63 The Court further held that the delivery of health care services does not constitute a protected core of the provincial power over health care,SCC, par. 66 because: # the proposed core has never been recognized in the jurisprudence, as courts are reluctant to identify new areas where interjurisdictional immunity applies;SCC, par. 67 #\\"the sheer size and diversity of provincial health power render daunting the task of drawing a bright line around a protected provincial core of health where federal legislation may not tread;\\"SCC, par. 68 and #\\"application of interjurisdictional immunity to a protected core of the provincial health power has the potential to create legal vacuums ... [which are] ... inimical to the very concept of the division of powers.\\"SCC, par. 69 As McLachlin CJ noted, = Section 7 of the Charter = The court found that s 4(1) of the CDSA engaged s 7 of the Charter but operated in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. Although that provision touched upon Insite users' life, liberty and security of the person by prohibiting drug possession at Insite, the s 56 exemption prevents s 4(1) of the CDSA from acting arbitrarily, overbroadly or grossly disproportionately upon Insite users. However, the court found that the Minister's failure to grant the exemption limited Insite users' s 7 Charter rights and breached the principles of fundamental justice. The failure to exempt Insite was arbitrary because it undermined the CDSA's purpose; namely, the \\"maintenance and promotion of public health and safety\\".SCC, par. 137 The failure was also grossly disproportionate in that it denied Insite's services, which had not had any \\"discernable negative impact on the public safety and health objectives of Canada during its eight years of operation\\".SCC, par. 133 While the court did not consider whether the Minister's failure to grant an exemption could be saved by s 1 of the Charter, they found that there would have been no rational connection between the Minister's failure to grant the exemption and the CDSA's stated purpose. The court exercised its s 24(1) Charter power and ordered via mandamus the Minister to grant Insite the exemption.SCC, par. 150 The court noted that the Minister ought to grant future exemption requests when the injection facility would \\"decrease the risk of death and disease, and there is little or no evidence that it will have a negative impact on public safety\\".SCC, par. 152  References  Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Canadian federalism case law Category:2011 in Canadian case law ","title":"Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society"},{"id":"45518586","text":"Maya Arriz Tamza is the nom de plume of Saoud Bousselmania (born October 27, 1957), an Algerian writer.

Source: Loewentheil Photography of China Collection. Lai Afong was born in Gaoming, Guangdong and arrived in Hong Kong in the 1850s as a refugee of the Taiping Rebellion. It is not known how he learned the wet-plate collodion process, but, it is said that by as early as 1859 had learned the art of photography. At some point between 1865 and 1867, Lai Afong worked at the Hong Kong studio of Portuguese photographer Jos√© Joaquim Alves de Silvieria; by 1870, the earliest known announcement of the Afong Studio was printed as an advertisement in the Hong Kong Daily Press. Lai Afong's subject matters ranged from portraits and social life pictures to cityscapes and landscapes. Little is known about his life, although many of his images survive today as testament to his extraordinary talent. After Lai Afong's death, the business was taken over by his son in the 1890s. Lai Afong traveled through the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Hebei, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, creating photographs. His collection of views included photographs of masterpieces of Chinese architecture such as sites within the Summer Palace and the Fragrant Hills Pagoda in Beijing, the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees in Guangzhou, and numerous others, as well as magnificent panoramas of such locations as Victoria harbor and Gulangyu island. As Lai Afong‚Äôs reputation quickly grew, both Chinese and foreign clientele flocked to his studio for portrait sessions, including some of China‚Äôs most important people such as Qing dynasty official Li Hongzhang. According to the verso of many of his Carte de visite works, he was photographer to Governor of Hong Kong Sir Arthur Kennedy KCB and Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia. Picture wall in Afong Studio Lai Afong was the most successful of his generation of Chinese photographers in appealing to both a Chinese and foreign cosmopolitan clientele. Lai Afong advertised in English-language newspapers ‚Äì offering a ‚ÄúLarger, and more complete collection of Views than any other Establishment in the Empire of China‚Äù ‚Äì and the artist captioned much of his work in both Chinese and English. Afong Studio photographs were sold to both Chinese patrons ‚Äì both those local to Hong Kong and those visiting from other parts of China ‚Äì and foreign visitors to China. The Afong Studio became a destination and training ground for foreign photographers in the region, and photographers such as Emil Rusfeldt and D.K. Griffith began their careers under the tutelage of Lai Afong. In 1875, Griffith claimed that his mentor had ‚Äúentered the arena of European art, associating his name with photography in its best form, and justly stands first of his countrymen in Hong Kong.‚Äù John Thomson, a Scottish photographer working in China at the time, praised Lai Afong‚Äôs images as ‚Äúextremely well-executed, [and] remarkable for their artistic choice of position,\\" in his book The Straits of Malacca, Indo-China, and China. Lai Afong seems to have been the only Chinese photographer of his generation to be embraced by his foreign contemporaries. However, his work is distinct among them, as many of Lai Afong‚Äôs photographic compositions show the technical and aesthetic influence of traditional Chinese painting, known as gu√≥hu√†.Meccarelli M. \\"New Perspectives about the Origins of Chinese Photography and Western Research in China\\" in Arte Dal Mediterraneo al Mar Della Cina ‚Äì Genesi ed incontri di scuole e stili.

The majority of the photographs exhibited were on loan from the collection of Stephan Loewentheil, who has amassed one of the world's foremost collections of Early Chinese Photography. Although in- person viewing was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, the exhibition received praise from international news outlets such as China‚Äôs largest newspaper, People‚Äôs Daily for ‚Äútruly [showing] the life of Chinese society in the 19th century, telling the story of China in that era‚Äù and in Fine Books and Collections for showcasing \\"magnificent views of a rapidly growing Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Xiamen, and important early portraits of the diverse people of late Qing Dynasty China.\\" As the most successful Chinese photographer of his time period, Lai Afong‚Äôs photographs offer a rare opportunity to view China and its people through the eyes of a Chinese artist, before the transformations of the twentieth century would change the country forever. After languishing in near obscurity for decades after his death, the presence of his work in archives such as the Loewentheil China Photography Collection has helped to expose Lai Afong to a wider contemporary audience. Lai Afong‚Äôs photographs are currently held in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the National Galleries of Scotland, and several other prominent museum collections. Identifying Afong Studio photographs Lai Fong. ‚ÄúPortrait of an Official.‚Äù 1870s. Albumen silver print. Source: Loewentheil Photography of China Collection.Several obstacles make it difficult to reliably identify the artists who photographed nineteenth-century China: the scarcity of material which is scattered around the world is seldom correctly recorded or catalogued, and the few identifiers and indexes that exist (artist, studio, location, etc.) are often erroneous. When early photographers went out of business or left China, the contents of their studios (including their glass plate negatives) were sold or auctioned off, and were often acquired by other photographers working in China who would then make new prints from the negatives to be incorporated into their own stock. Furthermore, especially in a country as large as China, travelers would often purchase photographs by several photographers they visited throughout their trips, and would combine them into a single album upon their return. As such, 19th century photograph albums, even those bearing the label of a particular studio, are often the work not only of that studio, but of several other unaccredited photographers as well. Despite Lai Afong's prominence, relatively few works can be securely identified as being from his hand. The scarcity of original photographs and absence of archival records make it challenging to identify Lai Afong‚Äôs work. Although photographs printed from Lai Afong‚Äôs own negatives dominated his photography studio‚Äôs production, The Afong Studio was known to occasionally include prints from negatives made by other photographers in albums it produced. This phenomenon extended to other studios as well, and Lai Afong‚Äôs photographs would often find their way into albums produced by other studios, or into albums assembled by the purchasers of the prints. Since Lai Afong was a ‚Äúmaster photographer with a highly attuned artistic sense,‚Äù he only incorporated work from well-regarded foreign photographers ‚Äì such as Milton Miller, John Thomson, and Dutton & Michaels. For example, the album People and Views of China, attributed to Lai Afong, contains images from Milton Miller, St. John Edwards, and other unidentified photographers. However, as Lai Fong expanded his collection of views through extensive photographic expeditions, he replaced the negatives by others with his own views. Afong Studio albums created after circa 1880 appear to contain few or no images from other photographers.

The scenario was written by Lloyd Lonergan based on Lydia Sigourney's Pocahontas poem. The film is a retelling of the well-known story of Pocahontas, played by Anna Rosemond who saves the life of Captain John Smith, played by George Barnes. Pocahontas is captured and held hostage by the English. She is converted to Christianity and marries Rolfe, played by Frank H. Crane. Pocahontas then sickens and dies, spending her last hours wishing to return to her native home. Released on October 11, 1910, the film was met with praise by most reviewers. It is believed that a replica of Hendrik Hudson's ship, Halve Maen, was used for the opening scene to establish the Jamestown landing. Though minor costuming and historical accuracy errors were pointed out, the film was praised as being of the highest quality of any Independent company. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: \\"Captain John Smith comes to America as the head of a band of English colonists and settles in Jamestown, Virginia. While at the head of the colony Smith makes a trip of exploration into the interior and is captured there by King Powhatan, the acknowledged head of all of the red men in Virginia. Powhatan orders his prisoner's execution. Just as the fatal club is about to descend, Pocahontas, the favorite daughter of the King, throws herself before her father. She begs so fervently that the white man's life be spared that Powhatan relents and orders his release. Captain Smith returns in safety to his friends. Later Pocahontas is taken prisoner by the English and held as hostage. While a prisoner, she is converted to Christianity, and falls in love with Rolfe, a handsome young Englishman. They are married in a rude little church at Jamestown, and the Indian princess sails away with her husband to England. There she is received with royal honors by King James I, but the foreign flower cannot stand transplanting. She soon sickens and dies, and in her last hours is visited by visions of the home in the wilderness that she would fly back to if she could.\\"  Cast  *Anna Rosemond as Pocahontas *George Barnes as Captain John Smith *Frank Hall Crane as John Rolfe  Production  The story was adapted from Lydia Sigourney's Pocahontas poem by Lloyd Lonergan. Originally published in 1841 as part of Pocahontas and Other Poems. Film historian Q. David Bowers states that while the story of Pocahontas was well-known, few people had ever read Sigourney's poem. Lonergan an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Anna Rosemond, a leading lady of the company, played the key role of Pocahontas and Frank H. Crane, a leading male actor, played the role of John Rolfe. George Barnes was cast in the role of Captain John Smith and it marked his first known credited Thanhouser appearance. Barnes played the role of the bandit who shot Broncho Billy in Edwin S. Porters The Great Train Robbery. The rest of the cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary listings. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Mrs. George Walters. According to a reviewer of the film, the cast included real Native Americans. 1909 Replica of Halve Maen It is believed that a reproduction of Hendrik Hudson's ship, Halve Maen (English:Half Moon), was used in the film. The replica was originally constructed for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909. This belief comes from the identification of the vessel by The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer who states, \\"One scene shows the copy of Henry Hudson's vessel used in the Hudson-Fulton celebration, and it is supposed in the film to represent the ship that brought John Smith and his party to America.\\" Another reviewer from The Moving Picture World confirms the usage in the production: \\"We all know the story, but it was left for this enterprising concern to show us John Smith landing from the Half Moon, which was borrowed for the occasion. This occurs at the very beginning and gives the film a stamp of reality that seldom has been obtained in any historical subject.\\" One flaw in the production was the scene in which Pocahontas appears in the court of King James and the setting draws attention over the action itself. The lack of a throne and unusual shaped windows, likened to those of a conservatory or enclosed veranda by the reviewer, diminishing the effect of the short scene. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on October 11, 1910. The film likely had a wide national release, with known showings in North Carolina, Indiana, Montana, and Kansas. The film was widely praised by supporters of the Independents and minimally praised by the reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror which was chiefly loyal to the Licensed companies. A review in The Moving Picture News stated, \\"Never did any Licensed manufacturer turn out a better picture, and seldom have they turned out one that's equal. The details, the settings, the staging and the acting, not neglecting the photography, put this picture way above par.\\" Walton, also of The Moving Picture News affirmed that the quality of the film, but acknowledged some minor historical accuracy points in the production itself. Walton concluded, \\"Such films as these lift moving picturedom into the higher plane, where its most enduring successes will be won. The presentation, in such a worthy form as this, of the timber from whence our nation has been hewn, cannot but meet with commendation. I feel sure England will welcome this stately production with as hearty a welcome as it has received, and merited, in New York.\\" The Moving Picture World also confirmed the quality of the production as one which further elevates the reputation of the Thanhouser Company. Standing in contrast, The New York Dramatic Mirror review criticized the production for being \\"too crowded for pictorial beauty and too stiffly acted for dramatic effect. The picture, therefore, falls short of the mark aimed at, although it is not unworthy of some praise. ... There are a number of flaws in the costuming that should not go unnoticed - the cloth trousers worn by some of the Indians, the iron hatchets carried by at least two of them, the corsets and tailor-made fancy Indian costume worn by Pocahontas.\\" The Mirror however was not impartial and was seen as an organ of the Licensed films. Despite this, the reviews were perceptive and were usually favorable to Thanhouser productions.

He is the founder and head of the Ohr Hachaim network of institutions, which operates educational, humanitarian, prison, and drug rehabilitation programs in 350 branches across Israel. He is also the founder and dean of Yeshivat Ohr Hachaim in Jerusalem, which enrolls more than 500 students. He is a senior member of the Moetzet Chachmei HaTorah of the Shas political party. Early life and education Reuven Elbaz was born in 1944 in Fez, Morocco.Greenbaum, Rabbi Avraham Dov. \\"Fifty Years of Light and Life\\". Hamodia Inyan Magazine, 3 October 2019, pp. 14-19. He learned both religious and general studies in a local Talmud Torah. At the age of 11, he made aliyah to Israel with other youths and studied in a school run by Poalei Agudat Yisrael. The school sponsored a communal bar mitzvah for him and his classmates. His parents made aliyah a few years later and settled in Tiberias. After his bar mitzvah, Elbaz transferred to Yeshivas Tiferes Yisrael in Haifa. Three years later he enrolled at the yeshiva of Magdiel, then headed by Rabbi Nachum Lasman, a student of Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz. Elbaz later studied at the Novardok yeshiva in Jerusalem under Rabbi Ben Tzion Bruk. Following his marriage to the daughter of Rabbi Shmuel Zakai, Elbaz began studying in Metivta HaRashal under Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. He earned rabbinic ordination and was certified as a dayan (rabbinic judge). In 1969, at the age of 25, he was named Rav of the Beit Yisrael neighborhood in Jerusalem. Leader of baal teshuva movement After the Six-Day War, Israeli and American Jews experienced a religious awakening, leading to the establishment of yeshivas and programs aimed at baalei teshuva (returnees to the faith). In the 1970s, Elbaz and Rabbi Amnon Yitzhak became the leaders of this movement among Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in Israel. Elbaz was known to frequent pool halls and coffee shops around Jerusalem to speak with young people, and sent cars blaring religious music and messages through low-income secular neighborhoods. He would invite youth to come hear a band in a local hall and then stand up on stage to speak to them. He also traveled around the country, from the Golan Heights in the north to Eilat in the south, to meet with young secular Jews in the entertainment venues they frequented and talk with them about religion. Beginning in the 1970s, Elbaz worked with young Sephardi Jews involved in crime, encouraging them to return to mitzvah observance, and was also asked by government officials to speak with parolees. Elbaz's religious outreach efforts led him to establish the Ohr Hachaim network, which operates yeshivas, synagogues, study halls, schools, child care centers, professional training seminars, soup kitchens, gemachim, programs in prisons, nursing homes and hospitals, and drug rehabilitation centers across Israel. The network founded religious schools in cities that had been \\"written off\\" as lost causes for Torah observance, including Beit Shemesh, Tel Aviv, Kiryat Gat, Bnei Ayish, Ofakim, Sderot, Hatzor HaGlilit, and Beit She'an. The network also operates a crisis hotline and provides medical consultations and referrals. As of 2014, the network has 350 branches across Israel. Elbaz named his organization after Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar (1696‚Äì1743), author of the Ohr Hachaim commentary on the Torah, as Elbaz identified with the outreach work that the Ohr Hachaim did among the Sephardi population in his native Morocco and in Livorno, Italy, en route to the Land of Israel. =Yeshivat Ohr Hachaim= Front entrance of Yeshivat Ohr Hachaim In 1968 Elbaz founded a baal teshuva yeshiva called Yeshivat Ohr Hachaim. The yeshiva opened in a two-room apartment in Jerusalem with an enrollment of 14 boys. Elbaz later acquired a large parcel of land in the Bukharim Quarter of the city and built a \\"towering\\" campus which opened sometime in the 2010s. The facility can accommodate up to 20,000 people. As of 2019, Yeshivat Ohr Hachaim has more than 350 undergraduates and nearly 200 avreichim (married students) learning on its campus. Elbaz gives regular shiurim to the various levels, teaching Talmud, halakhah, and mussar (ethics). Besides its educational program, Yeshivat Ohr Hachaim is known for the huge attendance it garners for its nightly Selichot prayers in Elul, the Hebrew month preceding Rosh Hashana. While nightly Selichot prayers during Elul are a Sephardi custom (Ashkenazi Jews begin saying Selichot during the week prior to Rosh Hashana), the prayer sessions at Yeshivat Ohr Hachaim attract thousands of visitors, including secular youth, yeshiva students, avreichim (married students), women, and girls from all religious streams. On one night in 2014, hundreds of Israeli Air Force officers and soldiers came to the yeshivah to participate in the Selichot prayers and also hear a special shiur from Rabbi Elbaz. In 2018, the Belzer Rebbe, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, attended one of the Selichot sessions accompanied by a group of his Hasidim. The Kikar HaShabbat website carries a live broadcast of the Selichot prayers as well. Other activities Elbaz is a popular lecturer at public gatherings in Israel, especially those for secular and baal teshuvah audiences. He has been described as \\"a charismatic and warm personality who can relate easily to non-religious people and make them feel comfortable and at ease\\". He is accepted by Sephardi and Ashkenazi Haredim as well. He gives a regular Tuesday-night shiur to a mixed audience of Torah scholars and baalebatim (working men), and speaks weekly on a radio program. In advance of Passover 2015, Elbaz established his own Badatz Ohr HaHidur kosher certification agency, affixing his hechsher to matzot. A few months later, he added poultry products and the four species for Sukkot to his certification program. In 2015, Elbaz was invited to become a member of the Moetzet Chachmei HaTorah of the Shas political party. Bribery conviction In 2004, Elbaz was implicated in a bribery case involving then- Minister of Knesset Shlomo Benizri of the Shas party. In April 2008, Elbaz received a suspended sentence of eight months and a 120,000 NIS fine for \\"facilitating and accepting bribes and conspiracy to commit fraud\\". Elbaz filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of Israel, which ordered the fine increased to 250,000 NIS. Notwithstanding the conviction, Elbaz continues to maintain his innocence. Personal life In 2012, Forbes Israel ranked Elbaz as one of the top 10 wealthiest rabbis in Israel, with personal wealth estimated at 40 million NIS. Works Shiurim (Torah lectures) by Elbaz are available online on beinenu.com.

After the death of his mother when he was only three years old, he was raised by his paternal grandparents in the town of Palazuelo de Bo√±ar. He studied Classical Literature and Philosophy at the Instituto Municipal de Bo√±ar, and when he turned 16 he joined the Dominican Monastery of Cangas de Narcea. Soon after his 20th birthday, when he was about to be ordained, Pablo Diez decided that the priesthood was not his true calling in life and moved to Madrid. In 1905, with the help he got from the Dominican Friars themselves, he sailed out to Mexico. Once in Mexico, he took on a job as book keeper at the Venegas bakery. In 1911 he became the manager of another bakery called La Primavera. As a result of his hard work, he was able to save enough money to first partner with and then, in 1912, buy that business from its previous owners. The following year, Diez Fern√°ndez became one of the founding shareholders of Leviat√°n y Flor, a company which has been recognized as the first compressed yeast factory in Mexico. In 1918, he married Rosario Guerrero Herrero, whom he had met during one of his many visits to Spain. Four years later he became part of the community of distinguished businessmen, industry experts, and bankers that would put up the capital to start the business which was later to become Grupo Modelo: Cervecer√≠a Modelo. A shareholder since the very beginning and member of its board of directors since 1926, the businessman from the region of Le√≥n in Spain continued to care for his bread and yeast production businesses while also promoting other new adventures. One of them, Pan Ideal, is famous for having been the first mechanical bread producing plant in Mexico. In 1928, Pablo Diez was appointed to the Board of Directors of Cr√©dito Espa√±ol de M√©xico, SA and of other important businesses of the Spanish community in Mexico. That same year, Braulio Iriarte entrusted him with the responsibility of being the legal representative of Cervecer√≠a Modelo. He was 44 years old at the time. Diez Fern√°ndez founded seminars, sanctuaries, and hospitals in his country of origin, for which he was highly recognized. The latter is also true for Mexico, where his philanthropic work left a profound mark on the development of nursing homes and hospitals. Among them the most recognized are the Sanatorio Espa√±ol, the Red Cross's central hospital in Mexico City and the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog√≠a; he made important donations to help build all these institutions. In 1955, don Pablo Diez crowned the Virgin of Guadalupe as the Queen of Work, sharing in the devotion shown for the Virgin by the workers in the largest of his companies: Cervecer√≠a Modelo. In recognition of this philanthropic work and his entrepreneurial accomplishments, in 1969 Don Pablo Diez received the highest honor granted by the Mexican government: the Orden del √Åguila Azteca. He was also a relevant shareholder in other companies in Mexico including IEM, Condumex, Fundidora Monterrey, Celanese Mexicana and Banco Nacional de M√©xico, and he served as the first Vice-president for this bank. In Spain, Cervecer√≠a Cruz Campo and Banco Central Hispano held his most relevant investments. Just before he retired from public life, although he remained as Honorary Chairman of Grupo Modelo, Diez Fern√°ndez turned over the business to the people close to him who had managed it for several years. The main shareholders of the new company that controlled Cervecer√≠a Modelo, a company whose sales in 1970 were estimated somewhere between 850 and 900 million pesos, were Juan S√°nchez Navarro, Manuel √Ålvarez Loyo, Nemesio Diez, Secundino Garc√≠a, Antonino Fern√°ndez, Pablo Aramburuzabala and other employees of the brewery which would later on become Grupo Modelo, the seventh largest beer group in the world, when it was headed first by Don Antonino Fernandez and, then, by Carlos Fernandez Gonzalez.Manilla, Antonio.

Zuo zhuan relates that after his advice was ignored, Qingji left the capital Gusu,ÂßëËãè moved to AidiËâæÂú∞ (in today's Jiangxi province), and finally took the chance to move into the state of Chu. According to the Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue, Qingji was the son of King Liao of Wu, and a warrior of Wu. Death According to the Zuo zhuan, in the winter of 475 BC, Qingji heard that the state of Yue was about to attack his homeland of Wu. He went back to Wu in order to arrange peace talks with Yue. Upon his return, he tried to eliminate Wu's disloyal people and obtain Yue's favor, for which he was murdered by a man of Wu.see: Â∑¶ÂÇ≥¬∑ÂìÄÂÖ¨‰∫åÂçÅÂπ¥. A more famous and detailed story of his death appears in the Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue's biography of King Hel√º of Wu. According to this story, King Hel√º was threatened at the beginning of his regime by Qingji's well-known bravery, and assigned a loyalist named Yao Li to murder him. Yao Li was given a public image of a person who endured great suffering under King Hel√º, substantiated by some pre- planned actual suffering such as imprisonment, the murder of his family, and cutting off his arm, so that he could obtain Qingji's trust. Qingji did in fact come to trust Yao Li, and during a joint boat trip, Yao Li murdered Qingli with a spear, and then committed suicide.See Âê≥Ë∂äÊò•Áßã¬∑ÈóîÈñ≠ÂÖßÂÇ≥¬∑ÈóîÈñ≠‰∫åÂπ¥ Monster by the same name Curiously enough, in the book Guanzi the same name, Qingji, is used to denote a monster having a human form four fingers high, riding a small horse.

Originally run by the Sigel family, it reached its highest point of popularity during its run under Paul Boesch. History Houston's wrestling legacy began shortly before World War I, with shows being held at irregular intervals from 1915‚Äî1923. Inspired by this, promoter Julius Sigel started Houston's City Auditorium (which has long since been torn down). Following the creation of this historic building, wrestlers began showing up in Houston on a regular basis to perform in weekly Friday night shows. In 1929, Sigel left to promote shows in New Orleans and Shreveport, Louisiana, leaving the promotion to his brother, Morris Sigel. Morris was not well versed in the wrestling business, but guided the promotion through strong business sense and surrounding himself with people capable of running wrestling shows without his help. During this time, a wrestler from Brooklyn, New York named Paul Boesch was on the wrestling scene, who would ultimately be one of Morris Sigel's main men. =Paul Boesch era= In 1947, Boesch was in a serious car accident that forced him to retire from performing. Sigel hired him as a backstage aid and radio announcer. As television became popular in Houston around 1949, Boesch became Houston Wrestling's first television commentator. After several years of jumping channels, Houston Wrestling ended up on Houston independent station KHTV (now KIAH), at which point it became a national phenomenon for over 30 years. Morris Sigel died on December 26, 1966. In early 1967, Boesch bought the Gulf Athletic Club from Sigel's widow, realizing that he was ultimately in the best position to carry on the Houston Wrestling legacy. Boesch noted that he had been training for this position for over two decades without realizing it, and was ready to practice his own ideas and run the company himself. Under his control, Houston Wrestling expanded its legacy, becoming one of the most popular promotions in the nation, rivaling even Dallas' popular World Class Championship Wrestling promotion. Wrestlers such as Billy Red Lyons and Gary Hart acknowledged Houston Wrestling as one of the best in the nation, and also praised Boesch as an honest man and a great promoter who almost always drew sell-outs for his cards. Boesch spent 21 years promoting in the Houston region out of the Sam Houston Coliseum, and affiliated himself with rival promotions (e.g., Southwest Sports; World Class Championship Wrestling; Southwest Championship Wrestling; Mid-South Wrestling/Universal Wrestling Federation) to bring the best wrestlers and matches to his fanbase. In the 1980s, amid the rise of cable television and rival territories' war to become the U.S.' sole national promotion, Houston Wrestling slid into decline. As some of its partner-promotions (e.g., Mid-South Wrestling/Universal Wrestling Federation) sold-out to larger rivals like Jim Crockett Promotions, Boesch chose to work with Vince McMahon's even larger World Wrestling Federation (later renamed WWE), instead. After a four-month partnership with the WWF, Boesch ended his career by promoting a retirement show on August 28, 1987. The show had a sell- out crowd of 12,000 fans, and effectively ended the Houston Wrestling promotion/territory. During the show, then-U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush honored Boesch via telegram. Boesch died two years later. Roster Houston Wrestling maintained a very fluid roster due to its reliance on other promotions to provide talent for its shows. The following wrestlers were at shows working for Houston Wrestling: * Junkyard Dog * Kamala the Ugandan Giant * Jake the Snake Roberts * King Kong Bundy * Wahoo McDaniel * Nick Kozak * Bull Curry * Fritz Von Erich * Hacksaw Duggan * Dick Murdoch * Johnny Valentine * Danny McShain * Boris Malenko * Nick Bockwinkel * Sputnik Monroe * The Kozak Brothers * The Midnight Express * Rock & Roll Express * JJ Dillon * Bruiser Brody * Gary Hart (wrestler) * Leo Newman * Jim Cornette * Shawn Michaels *The Blade Runners - Sting & The Ultimate Warrior Other popular wrestlers who made regular appearances for the promotion included: * Jose Lothario * Mil Mascaras * Ernie Ladd * Terry Funk * Dory Funk * Harley Race * Red Bastien * Ivan Putski * Superstar Billy Graham * Gino Hernandez * Andre the Giant * Bob Backlund * Bruno Sammartino * Stan Stasiak * Terry Taylor * Barry Darsow * Tony Atlas * Bruce Prichard External links *Slam Wrestling Article on Houston Wrestling *Houston Wrestling at Obsessed With Wrestling Category:Independent professional wrestling promotions based in Texas Category:Entertainment companies disestablished in 1987 Wrestling ","title":"Houston Wrestling"},{"id":"45518806","text":"Fr√∂ken Chic (English: Miss Chic) is a 1959 Swedish comedy film, directed by Hasse Ekman.

To put it another way, failure domains are regions or components of infrastructure that could fail. Each has its own risks and challenges to architect for. The size of a failure domain and its potential impact depends on the device or service that is malfunctioning. For example, a router potentially experiencing problems would generally create a more significant failure domain than a network switch would. Smaller failure domains reduce the risk of disruption over a large section of a network, and eases the troubleshooting process. Redundancy within failure domains is a key approach to help mitigate the risks of failure. For example, technologies like RAID helps mitigate the risks of drive failure by creating multiple data copies. Replication helps to mitigate the risks of server or storage array failure.

He was the father of William Rosewell (d. 1566) the Solicitor-General to Queen Elizabeth I. He was named as one of the trustee in his son's willWill of William Rosewell, Solicitor-General (1568), National Archives, PCC 11/48/607 of 1566 and managed his son's estates in Somerset while his son's children were under age. Family William Rosewell (Rowswell, Rowsewell, Ruswell, Rewsell) was born about 1500, the fourth son of Richard Rosewell (Rowswell) (c. 1473-1543) of Bradford on Tone, Somerset who married Alice Seeley (Ceelie, Ceelye, Scelye) of North Curry, Somerset.Weaver, F. W. (1885) The Visitations of the County of Somerset in the years 1531, 1573 and 1591, W Pollard, Exeter, p. 70-71. His brothers were: John Rowswell of Bradford on Tone; Reverend Adam Rowswell; and William Rosewell (Rowswell) of Dunkerton, Somerset. * John Rowswell (d. 1553) married Agnes Dyer, daughter of Richard Dyer of Wincanton, Somerset (and sister of Sir James Dyer) and had five sons: Richard, George, Alexander, Peter and Augustine; and five daughters: Elizabeth, Katherine, Thomazine, Joan and Dorothy.Will of Alexander Rosewell, gentleman of Soley, (1584), National Archives, PCC 11/67/43 * Adam Rowswell (d. 1567) was rector of Orcheston St George, Wiltshire in 1532; vicar of Clevedon, Somerset in 1558; and rector of Shepton Mallet, Somerset in 1559. * William Rosewell (1499-1568) married (1) Joan Fontneys (one son: John Rosewell of Englishcombe) and (2) Agnes Tilley (two sons: Thomas and William; and two daughters: Joan and Margaret). William of Dunkerton was the 2nd great grandfather of Reverend Thomas Rosewell. He had one sister, Joan, who married Thomas Foreacre (Foweraker, Voraker) of Bradford on Tone. One source suggests that Agnes Dyer of Wincanton married William Rosewell of Loxton but she married William's brother, John. No record of the marriage of William Rosewell has been found and a wife is not mentioned in his will of 5 July 1570Will of William Rowsewell, gentleman of Luxton, (1570), National Archives, PCC 11/52/323 so it is presumed that she had predeceased him. However, the parish records for Loxton show two burials which provide evidence of a wife and her name: William Rewsell, 17 July 1570 and Ares Rewsell, 17 April 1569. His wife may have been the widow of someone named Dyer as, in his will, William makes a bequest to his daughter in law (step daughter?) Joan Dyer. He also claims kinship with the Smythie (Smythe) family of Bristol and Wrington, Somerset, so his wife may have been a member of that family. In his will he names two children: his son William, deceased; and daughter Agnes married to George Badram (Budram). George Badram is identified as a cousin by Robert Smythe of Bristol. Activities Little is known about the life of William Rosewell from his birth at Bradford on Tone about 1500 to his death at Loxton in 1570. However, from some recorded events and from his will it appears that he was an educated and well respected man of some means. He was related to, and friends of, influential people and was prepared to invest in the education of his son, William, who became Solicitor-General. He was named as overseer in the 1541 will of William Davys of Bleadon; overseer in the 1545 will of Thomas Willinson, Parson of Christon; and witnessed the 1546 will of Robert Alan of Loxton. In 1556 he and his son, William, purchased the manor and advowson of Yarlington, Somerset. He was the collector of subsidy in Bath Forum Hundred in 1557. In 1564 with son William and nephew Thomas Rosewell of Dunkerton he purchased Limington Manor, Somerset. By the time of the Somerset Muster in 1569, when he was acting as trustee of his son's estates, he was recorded in the tithing of Loxton and Uphill as: William Rowsewell, gent, one corslet, one gelding for a light horseman furnished, one harquebut, one murrion, one paire of almain rivets furnished. Significance =Achievements= William Rosewell was able to achieve a significant improvement in his social status from that of his father, Richard Rowswell tenant of Bradford, to that of Yeoman at Loxton in 1544National Archives, C 1/1153/63 and to Gentleman in 1569. The title of Gentleman would have come from a recognition and general acceptance that he was a member of the landed gentry. He sub-leased land at Loxton from Thomas and John Payne whose lease was granted by Lord John Mordaunt (d. 1562).National Archives, C 1/1261/25 In 1544 he held copyhold land at Compton Bishop and with his son had bought the Manor of Yarlington in 1566. His brother, William of Dunkerton, had also joined the landed gentry by 1544. After the dissolution of the monasteries he acquired assets of Keynsham Abbey: for example, in 1544 a grant in fee of lands in Compton Dando, including chief messuage and Grange, and High Littleton rectory and advowson with all lands, glebes, tithes, etc. With John Hippisley (d. 1558), gentleman, he bought Ston Easton Manor c. 1545 for ¬£457-3s-4d; with son, Thomas, Stanton Prior Manor and advowson in 1553 and Farrington Gurney Manor in 1558. =Assets= Whilst it is clear that the dissolution of the monasteries provided an increase in the availability of new land and the opportunity for lease or purchase, it is not clear how the Rosewell family gained the financial means to do so. The father, Richard, was apparently a husbandman with no indication of his wealth. There was no mention in the abstract of his will of any free land or property although this is not unusual in such wills at that time, unlike his cousin in Hillfarrance, William Rousewill (d. 1522), who left free land and a flock of sheep at Otterford to his youngest son. There is no information available on how much land or other sources of wealth was held by Richard. Although he had been promised money by his wife's father, William Seeley, on their marriage, he had not received any or all of it by 1529.National Archives, C 1/668/42 Richard's parents were John (Jenkyn) (d. 1499) and Anastasia Rowswell of Bradford. In his will, John made small bequests of just ¬£2 to each of his children. However, the family had previously received substantial fines for supporting the 1497 rebellion against Henry VII (John ¬£20, Anastasia ¬£6 and Richard 10 marks) indicating that they did have some assets. At the same time William Seeley of North Curry was fined ¬£6. Richard Rowswell must have prospered to have the means to establish his sons on leases at Bradford, Dunkerton and Loxton respectively. This may have been in the same way as John Hippisley, of Ston Easton, who advanced from the son of a husbandman in 1528 to gentleman and Lord of the manor in 1545. His prosperity is attributed to an increase in food prices around the turn of the century. The Tudor period generally has been identified as a time when farming was for profit rather than for survival. Those with the drive to succeed could do so. The Rosewell family appear to have had the drive and ambition to succeed and they valued education as a means to achieve both careers for their sons and a higher social position. The improvements were incremental with each generation's successes creating opportunities and connections for the next to exploit. =Education= William Rosewell's Uncle, Thomas Rowsewell, attended Oxford University and was the incumbent of Bradford church from 1517 to 1558. His fees at Oxford were a bequest in the 1509 will of Thomas Austell, Treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. His brother, Adam, and two cousins from Hillfarrance also graduated from Oxford with one of the latter graduating D.C.L. in 1528. William of Loxton sent his son to be educated at Middle Temple leading to a career in law. His descendants, ending with Sir Henry Rosewell, also followed this path. The descendants of William of Dunkerton created an ecclesiastic dynasty including notable clerics such as Thomas Rosewell, Samuel Rosewell and Walter Rosewell. Whilst it later became common for the landed gentry to send their children to be educated at University or Inns of Court, the Rosewell tenants of Bradford appear to have been early adopters of this practice as a means of improving their position. =Independence= There were other changes taking place throughout the fifteenth century which would have influenced this family. The Black Death of 1348, and recurrences of plague later in the century, greatly reduced the population and led to competition for labour between manors with a consequent weakening of the lord's hold over his tenants. By the fifteenth century many manorial landlords derived their entire income from rents rather than from the sale of produce provided by tenant labour; but even rent income was threatened by the frequent unwillingness of tenants to take anything but the best land. The late fifteenth and early sixteenth century was a time of increasing confidence and assertiveness of the tenants as illustrated by the following case in the Court of Requests published by the Selden Society. :William's father, Richard Rowswell, died in Bradford on Tone in March or April 1543. At the next Bradford manor court, held in May 1543, his mother, Alice, tried to be registered as heir for her lifetime, but the lords refused to accept her for one of the holdings, and demanded a larger fine (inheritance tax) for the other, than the tenants regarded as normal. Two tenants (Thomas Foreacre and Richard Person) sued the lords (William Frauncys and Richard Warre) over this and other similar cases. Thomas Foreacre was William‚Äôs brother-in-law. ::'The land held by a Richard Rowswell in 1543 as copyhold was the house he lived in plus two holdings of farmland called Parkes and Furlonges, respectively, perhaps totaling about 7 or 8 acres. He may have had other land but these two holdings were chosen as one of the test cases brought by the tenants against their lords. Both holdings were copyhold, but the manor contained two types of copyhold, ordinary customary land and 'overland', and these holdings were one of each. Both sides produced evidence as to what the manor's local laws were. In the end the lords won on most points, because they looked through the old manorial records and found examples of previous inheritances which proved their case'. Like many other tenants, the Rosewell family became increasingly independent of their own manor and looked elsewhere for land to purchase or lease. =Connections= According to their wills, William Rosewell and his son were friends of Humphrey Colles of Barton Grange, Corfe and Pitminster, Somerset, who had ‚Äòmade his mark and fortune as an agent in the buying of ex- monastic land‚Äô following the dissolution of the monasteries between 1536 and 1541. This friendship, together with his son's position as Solicitor-General, would have made William Rosewell's family well placed to take advantage of the increased availability of land and to firmly establish themselves as landed gentry. Will Will of William Rowsewell, of Loxton, Somerset, gentleman. Will dated 5 July 1570 and proved 12 August 1570. Agnes my daughter and George Badram, shall enjoy all my lands, etc., in Loxton, which I hold of Thomas and John Payne.

Opened in 1963, the property was converted from an enclosed mall to an outdoor mall in 2014. The mall's anchor stores are JCPenney, AMC Theatres, Robert Miller & Son Furniture, Momentum Clothing & Accessories, Classy Nails, CosmoProf, and T-Mobile. History Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation built Kokomo Mall in 1963. Anchor tenants included Montgomery Ward, H. P. Wasson and Company, and J. C. Penney. By the end of the decade, the mall was purchased by Novil-Novick Associates, who enclosed the formerly open-air mall. Several stores at the mall closed throughout the 1980s, starting with National Food and Wasson's in 1980, followed by Montgomery Ward in 1981, G. C. Murphy, and several other original stores, leaving only J. C. Penney as an anchor. Meis replaced the former Montgomery Ward in 1987. After Meis opened, Kokomo Mall Associates bought the mall in 1986 from West-Penn Realty and added several new stores, including Phar-Mor in the former Wasson's. Also, the mall interior was largely rebuilt, and new marble flooring was installed. Meis was bought out by Elder-Beerman in 1989. In 1992, Manulife Real Estate acquired the mall. A year later, mall occupancy declined to 60 percent as tenants moved to other retail developments in Kokomo. Goody's Family Clothing opened an anchor store at the mall in 1998, taking over several small spaces in the J. C. Penney wing. By 2010, the mall was almost again empty after Goody's closed. Elder-Beerman's parent company, The Bon-Ton, closed the Kokomo Mall store in 2011 and replaced it with a Carson's at nearby Markland Mall. The space became Robert Miller & Son Furniture one year later, coinciding with mall renovations and a rename to Kokomo Town Center. In 2014, part of the mall structure was demolished, leaving only the storefronts on the east side, plus the J. C. Penney and Robert Miller stores, and the long- abandoned Phar-Mor. The property is now owned by Veritas Realty. On June 4, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney will be closing around October 2020 as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide. After JCPenney closes, Robert Miller & Son Furniture will be the only traditional anchor store left.

Biography Bjug Aanondson was one of ten children born on the Harstad farm near Valle in Aust-Agder, Norway. In 1861 his family emigrated to the United States. Bjug was a student at Luther College from 1865 to 1871. He studied theology at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis from 1871 to 1874. It was his experiences there that became the model for the rest of his scholarly and religious life. After seminary, he traveled as a pastor to remote areas of Minnesota, where he built schools and churches. 49 Harstad 49. Valle herad. Aust-Agder (Matrikkelutkastet av 1950)Harstad: Bjug 1848-1933, minister and educator (Norwegian Surnames in America) Harstad married Guro Svensdatter Omlid in 1877. From 1877 to 1891 he was pastor in Mayville and missionary in the Red River Valley of North Dakota. He was the founder of seventeen congregations; president of the Minnesota District of the Norwegian Synod (1884-1892); and founder of three academies: Franklin School (1878), Gran Boarding School (1880), and the Bruflat Academy (1889), all in North Dakota. The Lutheran Church sent Harstad to the Pacific Coast in 1889 to start a school. He visited Portland, Seattle, and Tacoma. It was decided that Brookdale, (now Parkland) in Pierce County, Washington, should be the Lutheran education center of the Northwest. Pacific Lutheran University Association was formed on December 11, 1890. Harstad was elected president of the association, and the Norwegian Synod formed a new Pacific District in June 1893. Harstad resigned his position as president of the Minnesota District, and acquired additional responsibilities by being elected president of the new Pacific District. He spent a considerable amount of time traveling to supervise the new far-reaching district and to raise money for the university.Bjug Aanondson Harstad (Find A Grave) The cornerstone laying was held in 1891 and Old Main was completed in 1894. Pacific Lutheran University opened for classes on October 25, 1894, with 30 students. Harstad taught religion, Latin, German, and Norwegian. On October 3, 1895, Harstad stepped down from the presidency at the university and was replaced by Rev. Ole Gr√∂nsberg from San Francisco. After leaving the university, Harstad traveled through the Willamette Valley, ministering to churchless Norwegian immigrants. He then stayed in San Francisco serving the congregation that Gr√∏nsberg had left, which had had some difficulty securing a new pastor. In addition, Harstad spent much of this time attempting to persuade people to help the university pay off its debt. President Gr√∏nsberg resigned in April 1897, and Harstad was reelected president and served for the next year.Norwegian Immigrant Founded 18 Churches In N.D. (The Fargo Forum. 16 January 2005, 23 January 2005. Curt Eriksmoen; edited by Jan Eriksmoen0 By 1898 gold had been discovered in Alaska, and Harstad became excited by the prospects of finding a fortune there. In February of the same year Harstad and Parkland resident Otis Larson left for Alaska on the SS City of Seattle. Harstad and Larson landed in Dyea, Alaska, and lived in a tent in sub-zero weather. They eventually staked a claim at Dawson City in the Yukon. The two men encountered adventurers, cold, mud, irreligion, and human vagaries, but no gold. After a year and a half, Harstad and Larson returned. Harstad continued as a member of the Board of Trustees until 1900, when his term was completed.Descendants of Yukon ‚ÄúGold Rusher‚Äù to Retrace His Steps Over Alaska‚Äôs Chilkoot Pass into Yukon Territory (Bethany Lutheran, Port Orchard, WA) In 1917, the Norwegian Synod, which had founded Pacific Lutheran University, merged with the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America and the Hauge Synod to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the Reformation. Harstad refused to join the new Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, thus formally separating himself from the school he had founded. From 1917 until 1922, Bjug Harstad served as president of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Harstad died on June 20, 1933 at age 84.

During that year, he received the top score of 5 on every Advanced Placement exam he took, and was chosen as class valedictorian in 1996. Shortly after graduation Robert and three of his classmates were one of three high school winners of the ExploraVision national scientific contest, earning them and their families a trip to Washington, D.C. The topic of their project was the future of nanotechnology. Although he had been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he chose instead to attend Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He graduated summa cum laude and with Phi Beta Kappa honors, from Wabash in 2000 with a double major in chemistry and math. He also did a two minors in biology and music, playing the bassoon, clarinet and piano. He then began graduate studies in chemistry at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. He received his Ph.D. in 2005 and remained at Caltech for a postdoctoral fellowship. During his years there he met Christine Ueda, another doctoral student who became his wife.  Research  Dirks was the first graduate student in the laboratory of Niles Pierce at Caltech. His dissertation was entitled \\"Analysis, design, and construction of nucleic acid devices\\". Dirks' work in computational chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational tools for the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands. His experimental work pioneered the hybridization chain reaction method, the first demonstration of the self-assembly of nucleic acid structures conditional on a molecular input. The method arose from attempts to use DNA hairpins as \\"fuel\\" for DNA machines, but Dirks and Pierce realized that they could instead be used for signal amplification, and when used in conjunction with an aptamer, as a biosensor. As an enzyme-free, isothermal method, it later found application as the basis of an immunoassay method, for in situ hybridization imaging of gene expression, and as the basis for catalytic, isothermal self-assembly of DNA nanostructures. Dirks then worked at D. E. Shaw Research in Manhattan to develop methods for computational protein structure prediction for the design of new drugs, beginning in 2006. Later life and death Dirks and Ueda married in 2007. She initially also worked at D. E. Shaw Research, but stopped in 2010 to raise the first of two children. The couple settled in the Westchester County suburb of Chappaqua, New York. He rose early to commute to his job via Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, and returned late but devoted as much time as possible on evenings and weekends to his children. On February 3, 2015, Dirks died in the Valhalla train crash. He was riding home in the front car of his train, which his brother says he likely did to take advantage of the quieter atmosphere, when it struck an SUV at a grade crossing north of Valhalla, south of the Chappaqua station. The train dragged the SUV while it came to a stop, loosening segments of the third rail that accumulated in the front car. Dirks, the SUV driver, and four other passengers were killed, making it the deadliest accident in Metro-North's history. Reactions to his death came from many quarters, many paying tribute to his scientific prowess. His father recalled that \\"he always got everything the first time. He always excelled.\\" Greg Sampson, Dirks' math teacher at Lewis and Clark, remembered when his student had finished an advanced class in trigonometry in just two weeks, something no other student of his has ever done, saying \\"he was just an amazing, amazing student.\\" Niles Pierce recalled how Dirks was willing to take a chance on working with a younger professor. His former postdoc was, he said, \\"an unusual student, even for Caltech... He did remarkable things.\\" D. E. Shaw Research, his employer, called him \\"a brilliant scientist who made tremendous contributions to our own research, and to the broader scientific community.\\" In April 2015, the International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering (ISNCSE), the main scientific society for DNA nanotechnology and DNA computing, established the Robert Dirks Molecular Programming Prize to recognize early-career scientists for molecular programming research. The first prize was awarded in 2016. As of June 2016, fundraising to establish a $100,000 endowment was ongoing.

It was designed by J & G Cowlishaw and built from to by Mr Clarke. It is also known as Harris Court. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  George Harris MLC, circa 1870 Harris Terrace is a two storey masonry building in George Street. Formerly a residential terrace of six houses, it was constructed in the mid-1860s for George Harris and was designed by architect James Cowlishaw. Since the 1820s, the north bank and adjacent ridgeline of the Brisbane River, now containing William and George streets, has featured a concentration of government and associated activities and uses. Over the period of the Moreton Bay penal settlement, buildings were constructed along this ridgeline, utilised by government officials for \\"accommodation, administration and control\\". When the area was opened for free settlement in 1842, the remnant penal infrastructure was used by surveyors as a basis for the layout for the new town of Brisbane. Set at right angles to the river, the prisoner's barracks determined Queen Street, while the line of buildings along the ridge determined William Street. Streets surveyed parallel to these streets, including George Street, formed Brisbane's rectangular grid. While a range of buildings and activities occurred along George and William Streets and the north bank from the 1840s, the government maintained a dominant presence in the area. At some sites (such as the Commissariat Store and the City Botanic Gardens), earlier uses were continued. The establishment phase following the separation of Queensland in 1859 saw the new colonial government reserve land parcels and construct a range of buildings to facilitate its functions. The building of the first Government House and Parliament House at the eastern end of George Street in the 1860s firmly entrenched the physical reality of a government precinct in the area. The location of Parliament House had a pronounced effect on the built environment around lower George Street. Many of Queensland's early politicians were pastoralists, a reflection of their economic dominance in the colony. Together with a growing workforce of public servants, these politicians required accommodation when in Brisbane. From the 1860s to the 1880s, a range of buildings, many built by, or for politicians, were constructed to address these needs. Harris Terrace was erected as a speculative investment for George Harris. Harris (1831-1891) was born in London, migrated with his family to Sydney in 1833 and came to Brisbane in 1848 to work with his elder brother John. The partnership of John and George Harris, general merchants and shipping agents, was established in 1853, with the firm involved in importing goods and exporting wool and tallow. George Harris became a well-known business and society figure in Brisbane. Following Queensland's separation from New South Wales in 1859 he was appointed a member of the first Queensland Legislative Council, serving until August 1878. The first half of the 1860s was a period of strong growth for Brisbane. Immigration boosted the population dramatically (more than doubling between 1861 and 1864 to over 12,000) and many substantial public and private buildings were constructed during this time. The permanent nature of the buildings was also partly influenced by provisions in the Municipalities Act 1864, which required brick or stone construction and non-flammable roofing material in designated first class building areas. Harris Terrace, circa 1869 In 1865 Harris commissioned architect James Cowlishaw to design a terrace building of six self-contained residences on the south-west corner of George and Margaret streets. The property, originally surveyed as allotment 1 of section 9, had been previously owned by John Betts, a property speculator who bought the land at one of Brisbane's earliest land sales in Sydney in 1842. It is unclear if any improvements were made to the land prior to Harris purchasing the property in 1856. Cowlishaw, considered Brisbane's \\"first successful private architect\\" arrived in 1860 from Sydney and soon became highly regarded and in demand. Prior to designing the terrace, Cowlishaw undertook other design work for Harris and his firm, including improvements to J&G; Harris' wharf and stores at nearby Short Street, a new Ipswich warehouse, and repairs and additions to his then residence, Newstead House. In 1861 Cowlishaw also designed a terrace building on the opposite corner of George and Margaret Streets for another politician, Arthur Hodgson. Terrace houses were an urban residential building type that came to Australia from England in the early nineteenth century. Essentially narrow fronted adjoining houses, terraces were built as dwellings for people across the classes, as was reflected in their respective forms, scales, materials and settings. While fairly common in mid-to-late 19th century suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, terraces were always fewer in number in Brisbane. Those that were constructed were largely in the centre of Brisbane, or in nearby residential areas like Spring Hill and Petrie Terrace. The Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885, introduced to avoid \\"slum\\" conditions in areas of medium density dwellings, effectively limited the construction of terraces in Queensland. The limit of a minimum size of for allotment subdivisions firmly established the detached house as the standard dwelling. While some terrace houses were built by property speculators as rentals in Brisbane after 1885 (most notably The Mansions ), these dwellings could not be sold individually. Other than Harris Terrace, only two other terrace houses constructed in the 1860s, Athol Place, Spring Hill and Princess Row, Petrie Terrace, survive in Brisbane. Cowlishaw first advertised for whole or separate tenders for the construction of Harris Terrace, described as \\"six first class houses\\", in July 1865. He readvertised in February 1866, again requesting the erection of the six houses \\"at the risk of the former contractor\\". When the building was completed, a Mr Clarke was identified as the contractor, with the cost of construction . The building was advertised in December 1866 as ready for occupation from 1 January 1867. Shortly after, the building was described as, \\"...substantially built, possessing an imposing exterior presence, and the interior arrangements contain all the requisites of a well-finished dwelling house of the mother-country, combined with the protection required by a warm climate...\\". When completed, Harris Terrace was a two-storey brick building with an attic level in the roof space. In each of the six houses, the ground floor contained drawing and living rooms, with bedrooms on the first floor and in the attic. To the rear, two storey outbuildings housed the kitchen, bathroom and maid's room. A slate roof with dormer windows were partly concealed by a balustraded parapet, inscribed with \\"Harris Terrace 1866\\" at its centre. A cast iron balustrade and full length venetian blinds featured on the upper balcony. Early tenants of Harris Terrace who were parliamentary politicians included Joshua Bell, William Yaldwyn and Kevin O'Doherty. Other early tenants, Mrs Unsworth (no. 5) and Mrs and Miss de Villers (no. 3) ran girls schools in 1867, with the latter offering rooms for boarders. By mid-1868 Harris Terrace was promoted as having \\"already acquired the reputation of being the best private residences in the city\\". Along with politicians, medical professionals and senior public servants also numbered among early residents. The houses were individually numbered and some were given their own name. Following insolvency in 1876, George Harris surrendered Harris Terrace to mortgagee James Taylor, a Darling Downs landholder and politician.The Queenslander 28 October 1876, p.18 In 1887 the property was acquired by two other members of Parliament, Boyd Morehead and William Pattison who both lived at Harris Terrace at this time. The following year Morehead and Pattison, with another politician John Stevenson, commissioned the building of The Mansions - Brisbane's most elaborate terrace house, adjacent to Harris Terrace on the opposite corner of George and Margaret streets. The use of the houses in Harris Terrace for accommodation continued into the first decades of the twentieth century. From the mid-1880s some of the individual houses became boarding houses. By the 1920s all of the houses contained in Harris Terrace were being utilised for boarding, often called \\"residential chambers\\". In 1922 Frank, Jessie and Ethel Lingley bought the building and changed the name to \\"Harris Court\\". The Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act was repealed in 1923 and from this time individual titles were created for houses at Harris Court. The Lingleys retained the house on the Margaret Street corner adapting it into a cafe and building an extension to the footpath. The Royal Queensland Art Society acquired one of the houses in 1924. House no. 5 (fifth from the Margaret Street corner) had by the 1940s been altered with a two storey extension to the George street alignment, with an awning over the footpath. The immediate post-war years of the late 1940s saw the Queensland Government expand their activities considerably in Brisbane City. Most public servants were then located in the Treasury Building and Executive Building (later the Land Administration Building) in George Street and in offices in the Anzac Square Building. The shortage of office accommodation in the centre of Brisbane, and the need to address future requirements, led to a phase of governmental property acquisition in the city. The purchase of properties on George and William Streets between the Queensland Government Printing Office and Parliament House was a key focus, in addition to other acquisitions on Charlotte, Mary and Margaret streets. Harris Court was purchased around this time. Despite their varying condition and former uses, the shortage of office space saw many of these newly acquired buildings quickly adapted for government use. Because Harris Court was bought with the existing leases, it was not until the mid-1950s that the last tenants left the building. In 1958, architect John Hitch, in association with architects from the Department of Public Works, prepared plans to adapt Harris Court for government use. The original service wings and outbuildings to the rear were demolished and a new steel framed, sawtooth annexe, connected to the earlier structure was constructed, containing open plan office spaces. Major alterations occurred to the original building in 1960-61, including the removal of the upper balconies and ground floor verandahs, construction of an enclosure on the street alignment linking the houses, and the replacement of the front doors of four of the six houses by windows, leaving entrances at either end of the building. Original windows were removed or replaced, barrel vaulted dormers replaced with gabled dormers, and chimney and fireplace openings were bricked in. The interiors of Harris Court were also substantially altered. Three of the original six staircases were removed, and whole walls and sections of party walls were removed for full length corridors on both floor levels. A range of government offices were accommodated in the old building and annexe following the completion of works. The consolidation of government ownership and usage along George and William streets led to the state investigating a number of schemes to further the development of a \\"government precinct\\". By 1965, a masterplan had been developed involving the demolition of all buildings between the old Executive Building and Parliament House, to enable the construction of three 15-storey office buildings in a \\"plaza setting\\". The present day Executive Building was completed in 1971 as part of this plan. By the early 1970s this plan for the precinct was considered no longer suitable and a number of other proposals for the area were explored. A 1974 \\"George Street Masterplan\\" involved lower rise buildings spread out over greater areas, some retention of existing buildings and the demolition of the Bellevue Hotel (opposite Parliament House) and adjacent The Mansions. A major influence in ultimately shaping the layout of the area during the 1970s was the growing community support for the retention of older buildings within the government precinct, especially the Bellevue Hotel and The Mansions. Spearheaded by the National Trust, the government-related associations and links between buildings, their architectural qualities, and aesthetic contributions to the area were highlighted in submissions to the government and in the public sphere. The unannounced June 1974 removal of the balconies of the Belle Vue Hotel was a deliberate action by the Queensland Government to degrade the visual appearance of the area, and drew further attention to the conservation cause. In April 1979 Cabinet adopted a recommendation for a schedule of demolition work to progress the development of the government precinct. The Bellevue Hotel was to be demolished, but The Mansions and the original section of Harris Court were to be retained, renovated and adapted. On 21 April, three days after this decision, the Bellevue Hotel was demolished in the early hours of the morning, a notorious event in the history of heritage conservation in Queensland. Harris Court (together with The Mansions) was retained in the forecourt of the State Works Centre (80 George Street), a seven level building on two George Street blocks (bridged across Margaret Street) completed in 1985. As part of this project, renovations and major reconstructions were undertaken at Harris Terrace involving architects from the Department of Public Works in association with Conrad and Gargett Architects. Work included the reconstruction of the ground floor verandah and upper floor balcony; new iron columns and balustrade on the balcony similar to the originals; a new slate roof, reinstatement of front entrance doors (not all operable) and vaulted dormers (made larger than the originals at the rear); installation of new doors, windows, architraves and skirtings of earlier forms and profiles; and new moulded ceilings on the ground and first floors. It was at this time the building reverted to its original name of \\"Harris Terrace\\". Since this time only minor alterations have occurred. In 2012 Harris Terrace provides offices spaces for a number of community organisations.  Description  Harris Terrace is a row of six, brick, two storeyed attached former houses, located on the corner of George and Margaret streets within the government precinct. The street facade features a double-storeyed verandah with cast iron balusters and posts. The verandah is separated into six sections reflecting the original six houses. Each section has three French doors on the first floor, and two sash windows and the front door on the ground floor. The parapet incorporates a central plaque with the name of the building and date of construction. The tiled gable roof features six chimneys and dormers with barrel shaped roofs and the bull nose verandah roof is corrugated iron. The rear elevation includes four short double-storeyed wings which form shallow courtyards. The first floor windows in the wings have round arches while the rear windows of the main building are flat arched. The roof dormers have barrel vaults and the wings are gabled. The interior consists of modern offices opening onto a central hallway which runs the length of the building.  Heritage listing  Harris Terrace was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Harris Terrace, constructed as a row of six houses in 1865-66, is important in demonstrating the evolution of residential housing in Queensland. A rare example of 1860s terrace housing, the building illustrates the early use of this housing type in Brisbane. Harris Terrace is important in demonstrating the early residential nature of lower George Street, a pattern that largely occurred in response to the concentration of government and associated activities in this area of inner Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As one of only three remaining 1860s terrace house buildings, Harris Terrace is important as a rare example of this type in Queensland. Beyond its rarity as terrace housing, Harris Terrace is one of few remaining 1860s buildings in Brisbane City. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Harris Terrace has potential to contribute to a greater understanding of Queensland's history. The area immediately behind the building may contain archaeological evidence including the foundations of the service wings and 1960s building additions. Artefacts within this area may include those commonly associated with domestic habitation such as glass, ceramics and bone, and some artefacts associated with commercial and office activity during the 20th century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. In its dignified front elevation, form and scale, Harris Terrace is an important element of lower George Street, a streetscape dominated by late nineteenth century buildings. More widely, the building makes an important contribution to the government precinct that exists between George Street and the Brisbane River.

The publication was prepared by Karen Kent and Murugiah Souppaya of the National Institute of Science and Technology and published under the SP 800-Series; a repository of best practices for the InfoSec community. Log management is essential to ensuring that computer security records are stored in sufficient detail for an appropriate period of time. National Institute of Science and Technology Background Effective security event logging and log analysis is a critical component of any comprehensive security program within an organization. It is used to monitor system, network and application activity. It serves as a deterrent for unauthorized activity, as well as to provide a means to detect and analyze an attack in order to allow the organization to mitigate or prevent similar attacks in the future. However, security professionals have a significant challenge to determine what events must be logged, where and how long to retain those logs, and how to analyze the enormous amount of information that can be generated. A deficiency in any of these areas can cause an organization to miss signs of unauthorized activity, intrusion, and loss of data, which creates additional risk. Scope NIST SP 800-92 provides a high-level overview and guidance for the planning, development and implementation of an effective security log management strategy. The intended audience for this publication include the general information security (InfoSec) community involved in incident response, system/application/network administration and managers. NIST SP 800-92 defines a log management infrastructure as having 4 major functions: * General - log parsing, event filtering and event aggregation; * Log Storage - rotation, archival, compression, reduction, normalization, integrity checking; * Log Analysis - event correlation, viewing and reporting; * Disposal - clearing; NIST SP 800-92 address the following security log management challenges: * Log volume exceeding the rate of analysis; * Ensuring immutability during storage and transmission; * Inconsistent vendor log formats; * Importance of a consistent review schedule; * Retention issues involving purging, long term storage, and cost; NIST SP 800-92 makes the following recommendations for security log management: * Establish policies and procedures for log management; * Prioritize log management appropriately throughout the organization; * Create and maintain a log management infrastructure; * Provide proper support for all staff with log management responsibilities; * Establish standard log management operational processes; Compliance The following federal regulations require the proper handling and storage of sensitive log data: * HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996).

It is 200 km in diameter. Its location is 7.66 ¬∞S and 27.9 ¬∞W. Arsinoes Chaos was named after Arsinoe, a queen of ancient Egypt, daughter of Ptolemy and Berenice. Chaos terrain on Mars is distinctive; nothing on Earth compares to it. Chaos terrain generally consists of irregular groups of large blocks, some tens of kilometres across and a hundred or more meters high. The tilted and flat topped blocks form depressions hundreds of metres deep. A chaotic region can be recognized by a rat's nest of mesas, buttes, and hills, chopped through with valleys which in places look almost patterned.Carr, M. 2006. The Surface of Mars. Cambridge University Press. Forget, F., et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing, Chichester, UK. Some parts of this chaotic area have not collapsed completely‚Äîthey are still formed into large mesas, so they may still contain water ice.http://themis.asu.edu/features/aramchaos Some buttes and mesas in Arsinoes display layering. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together.

It was also the first steamboat to tow large cargo barges on that river, in May 1864 and to reach Callville, Nevada in 1866. Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 History Esmerelda was built in San Francisco at the 3rd Street shipyard of Patrick Henry Tiernan at Steamboat Point in 1862 for Captain Washington Pitts. It was a stern wheeler, 100 feet long, 24 feet by the beam, hold 3.5 feet deep. E. M. North, Evolution of Shipping and Shipbuilding in California VI, February 1899, The Overland Monthly, Vol. XXXIII, January - June 1899, Overland Monthly Publishing Company, San Francisco, 1899. In 1864, the Esmerelda was now owned by the Union Line of Captain Thomas E. Trueworthy. He sent her and the Victoria, a four-masted schooner converted from a barge, under Captain Charles C. Overman, to the Colorado River to establish the Union Line as the opposition line to George A. Johnson & Company there. The Victoria was to be a store ship at the mouth of the river, but she was soon broken up by the tidal bore soon after it reached the mouth of the Colorado in March. After Overman arrived at the river he built the Black Crook, first tow barge to be used on the Colorado River. Of a type commonly used on the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento River and its tributaries, the barge was 128 x 28 feet capable of carrying 100 tons of freight. These barges were towed on a 100-foot cable secured to a short mast atop the steamboat amid-ship to avoid fouling with the stern-wheel. Each barge had a helmsman that steered the barge in the wake of the boat towing it. In early May Trueworthy took the Esmerelda up river for the first time with the Black Crook in tow making it to Fort Yuma in three days, eight hours. With the addition of the other opposition steamer \\"Nina Tilden\\" and a third Johnson steamer the \\"Mohave\\" in furious competition, the backlog of freight that had stimulated the creation of the rival steamboat companies went away by the fall of 1864. The only new business to be had by the opposition was to service the settlements Utah, up river at a landing Callville cutting costs of transportation by $100 a ton, on third of the cost of the overland route from Los Angeles. Trueworthy proposed to do this at all times of the year, and tried to take the Esmerelda there in 1865, towing a barge loaded with merchandise and timber, but turned back at the Roaring Rapids in Black Canyon, to tie up his boat at El Dorado Canyon and sell his cargo. Johnson associate William Harrison Hardy had succeeded in getting there first, leaving January 2, poling and sailing (when the wind was favorable) a 50 by 8 foot flat boat \\"Arizona\\" 90 miles from Hardyville to Callville in 12 days. In the summer of 1865, Esmerelda was consolidated with the other rival boat, into the Pacific and Colorado Steam Navigation Company, also headed by Thomas E. Trueworthy, with backing from San Francisco financiers. Trueworthy tried again to reach Callville during the high water in the summer of 1866. Esmeralda with a barge and ninety tons of freight, under Trueworthy's former first mate Captain Robert T. Rogers. After three months, the Esmeralda reached the landing at Callville on October 8, 1866. She was slowed by lack of firewood and at became known as the Ringbolt Rapids, with insufficient power to ascend the rapids, a ringbolt had had to be set in the canyon wall and the boat pulled through with a line run to her capstan. Despite her triumph at reaching the new \\"head of navigation\\" at Callvile, Esmerelda was seized by the Sheriff of Yuma County, for debts owned by Thomas E. Trueworthy's company, and passed through the hands of Arizona Navigation Company, another company the creditors tried to form hoping to salvage the opposition steamboat business. This failing, Esmerelda was sold in the fall of 1867, to George A. Johnson & Company, that had the boat dismantled 1868.

HMS Unite captured her less than two months later. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Tuscan. She served in the Mediterranean and participated in one action that earned her crew a Naval General Service Medal. She was first offered for sale in 1816 and sold in 1818. At that time mercantile interests purchased her and she became a whaler, making six voyages before being condemned as no longer seaworthy in March 1840 and sold in April during her seventh voyage. Capture Unite encountered Ronco at daybreak on 2 May 1808 some seven or eight miles NW of Cape Promontore, Istria. Ronco fired several broadsides that cut up Unites sails and rigging, and then surrendered. Captain Campbell of Unite described Ronco as being armed with sixteen 32-pounder carronades, and \\"only Two Months off the Stocks, measures about Four Hundred Tons, extremely well found, and in my Opinion, very fit for His Majesty's Service.\\" Ronco had barely struck when Unite sighted a frigate and a schooner to windward. Unite immediately gave chase, but her quarry escaped into Pola. The Royal Navy heeded Campbell and took Ronco into service as HMS Tuscan. HMS Tuscan Tuscan was commissioned in August 1808 in the Mediterranean under Commander John Gourley (acting). One month later Commander John Wilson replaced Gourly. Between 30 October and 1 November Tuscan was part of Admiral Benjamin Hallowell's squadron at the Bay of Rosas. On 30 October, boats from Tuscan joined with boats from , , , , , , and in a cutting out attack after a squadron off the south of France chased an enemy convoy into the Bay of Rosas in the Battle of Maguelone. The convoy had lost its escorting ships of the line, and , which had run aground near Frontignan and been scuttled by their crew. Still an armed storeship of 18 guns, two bombards, and a xebec protected the convoy. Some of the British boats took heavy casualties in the clash, but Tuscan had only one officer slightly wounded, and one seaman dangerously wounded. By the following morning the British had accounted for all eleven vessels in the bay, burning those they did not bring out. In January 1813, prize money was awarded to the British vessels that took part in the action for the capture of the ships of war Grondeur and Normande, and of the transports Dragon and Indien. A court declared a joint captor. Head money was also paid for the Grondeur and Normande and for the destruction of Lamproie and Victoire. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"1 Nov. Boat Service 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. In December 1810 Commander George Matthew Jones replaced Wilson. However, in January 1811, Lieutenant Phillips (acting) took temporary command. Jones returned to command by February, holding it until through 1812. In 1811 Tuscan supported the British Army in Spain, especially in the efforts to break the siege of Cadiz by landing troops to attack the French at Isla de Le√≥n. In 20 February a naval force of warships and transports under the command of Captain Edwin Brace HMS St Albans weighed anchor. The 7000 troops Lieutenant-General Thomas Graham landed at Algeciras and marched to Tariffa. There the transports the artillery and military stores in heavy surf. Subsequently, Graham participated in the Battle of Barrossa.The Royal Navy ships involved, in addition to St Alban's and Tuscan, included , , Sabine, , and .Naval Chronicle, Vol. 25, p.339. In October, a French force was pressing on Spanish General Francisco Ballesteros in the vicinity of San Roque, C√°diz. Ballasteros asked for assistance. Rear- Admiral Legge, the commander of the British fleet at Cadiz, dispatched a force on 11 October to Tariffa to come to his assistance. , and Tuscan carried eight companies each from the 47th and 87th regiments of foot, a detachment of 70 men from the 95th Regiment, and four light artillery pieces. The troops landed on 18 October and the next day the French advanced along the coast. Fire from Tuscan, Statelys boats, and Gunboat 14 sent them into retreat. When the War of 1812 broke out, the British captured several American ships in the Mediterranean. Tuscan shared with San Juan, Sabine, , , and in the American droits for Phoenix, Margaret, Allegany and Tyger, captured on 8 August 1812. Tuscan arrived at Portsmouth on 11 October, having convoyed transports from Gibraltar. In May 1813, Jones recommissioned Tuscan, which returned to the Mediterranean. Tuscan shared with and some other British vessels in the salvage for the recapture two Spanish vessels El Correv Diligente de Carraccas and Nostra Senora de los Desemperados on 26 May.

PBIS uses evidence and data-based programs, practices and strategies to frame behavioral improvement in terms of student growth in academic performance, safety, behavior, and establishing and maintaining positive school culture. PBIS addresses the needs of at-risk students as well as the multi-leveled needs of all students in regards to behavior, which creates an environment for both teaching and learning to occur in schools. The approach is believed by researchers such as Robert H. Horner to enhance the school staff's time for delivering effective instructions and lessons to all students. In contrast to PBIS, many schools used exclusionary discipline practices including detentions, suspensions, or expulsions to separate students from the classroom and from peers. PBIS emphasizes preventing problem behaviors before they happen to increase the opportunity for students to learn by keeping them in the classroom. PBIS is a team-based framework for schools that borrows elements from response to intervention, an intervention that uses diagnostic data to develop personalized learning plans for all students. Background PBIS is an acronym for Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports.Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) (n.d.). \\"Positive behavioral intervention and supports (PBIS)\\". Retrieved March 9, 2015. Effective classroom management and discipline are essential for teaching and learning. PBIS emphasizes the integrated use of classroom management and school-wide discipline strategies coupled with effective academic instruction to create a positive and safe school climate for all students. PBIS is based in a behaviorist psychology approach to improving student behavior, which means that teachers and students identify misbehavior, model appropriate behaviors, and provide clear consequences for behavior in the classroom context. In a PBIS model, schools must define, teach, and reinforce appropriate behaviors to ensure success. Research shows that punishing students inconsistently without a positive alternative, is ineffective and only offers short-term solutions.Bradley, Renee (2015). \\"Positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS)\\". U.S. Department of Education (OSEP Technical Assistance Center). Retrieved March 9, 2015. Modeling and rewarding positive behaviors are more effective. The goal of PBIS is to establish a positive school climate. To do this, a continuum of behavior support has been established which can be applied at the school level (primary level), for small groups of students (secondary level), and for individual level (tertiary level). When PBIS is applied to the entire school, it is called schoolwide PBIS, or SWPBIS. Core features PBIS is not a packaged program for districts to purchase. Instead, it is a framework approach that helps schools to identify the key tasks in developing preventative positive behavior tailored to their own school. It is an approach defined by the following core design components. =Outcomes= The outcome is the goal for improved student behavior towards which the school community aims. The goals must be measurable, and must clearly be the result of implementing the PBIS model.Student Services (2015). \\"Positive behavior interventions & supports (PBIS): What is PBIS?\\" Retrieved March 9, 2015. Outcomes of a successful PBIS framework with a school can be measured in both behavior data and academic achievement of the students in the school. The academic and behavior goals are often defined and supported by the students, families, and teachers in tandem for the program to succeed. =Data= PBIS is grounded in the data being used for all levels of decision making.Bradley, Renee (2015). \\"Positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS)\\". U.S. Department of Education (OSEP Technical Assistance Center). Retrieved March 9, 2015. The team often considers trends in numbers, locations of where problems occurred, which classes they occurred in, and individual students that were involved. Through the data, schools take stock of their current situation, pinpoint areas for change and or improvement, and evaluate the effects of current and future interventions. =Practices= This component refers to the evidence-based curriculum, instruction, interventions, and strategies implemented within the school, and are meant to create a common and shared understanding of expectations. These practices are introduced through the team after a review of the data. =Systems= PBIS requires a review team of educators with buy-in from across the school and strong administrative support to design and enforce the PBIS system. The team is generally a representative group of all of the staff (classroom teachers, special education teachers, specialists, etc.). In a secondary school, students could also be included as part of this team. The team creates the systems used by the remainder of the staff and the students they serve. Continuum of support Each PBIS model uses a continuum of support. Tiers of support that range in intensity are offered to students as their needs fluctuate. Most students are supported by tier 1 (universal) level of support, which describes the general school context. As students struggle with the behavioral expectations of the model, they may advance to higher tiers to provide more support. =Tier 1: Primary Level (support for all)= The first level in PBIS is the universal level. In terms of PBIS, this refers to the school-wide expectations that are defined and taught to all school staff in each of the settings within the school. These expectations are developed by the team and taught to students by their regular classroom teachers, administrators or others who have contact with all students. Many schools who have adopted this framework use, \\"Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible,\\" but like all aspects, this is determined by the school. The fidelity of the expectations should be determined by the continuous collecting of data.Galloway, R., Panyan, M., Smith, C. & Wessendorf, S. (in press) Systems change with school-wide positive behavior supports: Iowa‚Äôs work in progress. Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions. Along with the expectations, there should be a system of acknowledgement and reinforcement of expected behaviors. The Core Principles of PBIS at the primary level are: #schools can effectively teach appropriate behavior to all students #intervene early #use a multi-tier model #use research-based interventions #monitor student progress often #use data to make decisions #use assessments to screen, diagnose, and monitor progress These principles make the PBIS program significant in that it makes it more proactive rather than reactive. Furthermore, PBIS helps schools develop a common language, common practices, and consistent application of positive and negative reinforcement at a school-wide level. =Tier 2: Secondary Level (support for some)= Although the primary level is taught and reinforced with all students, there may be some students who need additional intervention for students with at-risk behaviors as determined by the data. Secondary prevention provides intensive or targeted interventions to support students not responding to the primary efforts. These behavioral interventions are taught by specialized staff like special educators, school psychologists, behavior interventionists, and counselors. Some examples of tier 2 behavior interventions are targeted social skill groups, behavior plans with continuous progress monitoring. =Tier 3: Tertiary Level (support for few)= PBIS also acknowledges that some students have high risk behaviors and need specialized, or individualized skill building practice due to exhibited habits of problem behavior. Tier 3 behavioral interventions involve a functional behavioral assessment (FBA) and an individualized plan of support which includes: #new skills to replace problem behaviors #reorganization of current environment or \\"triggers\\" #procedures for monitoring, evaluating, and reassessing the plan. To succeed in a tier 3 intervention, both tier 1 and tier 2 interventions must also be in place. Also, support must be conducted in a comprehensive and collaborative manner. The Tier 3 process should include the student with the behavior issue and the people who know them the best on a personal level working together as a behavioral support team (BST). Support should be tailored to the student‚Äôs specific needs. It should also include multiple interventions. The goal at this level is to diminish problematic behavior, increase adaptive skills, and attempt to increase the student‚Äôs quality of life. Alternatives to PBIS =Culturally responsive PBIS= Culturally responsive PBIS (CR-PBIS) is also a framework aimed at restructuring school culture much like PBIS. However, CR-PBIS emphasizes change through understanding and interacting with the community. Providing an environment in which all cultures are acknowledged, respected, and celebrated is important in building the bridge between home culture and school culture. To ensure all students succeed, an understanding of their various cultural beliefs and practices are a must. When someone engages in culturally responsive practice, they are forming an understanding about the values, beliefs, and behaviors of other people than themselves. Race has been a predictor of success in schools for decades. Students of color have statistically lower rates of success. Part of the job of educators is to help bridge the social understanding gap in order to bridge the educational understanding gap.Wisconsin PBIS Network (2015) \\"Culturally Responsive Practices\\". Retrieved April 2, 2015. Because of this, there is some concern that PBIS alone creates outcome disparities due to culture. The behavior of students with color, without the knowledge of the community they come from, may be seen as disruptive, resistant, and limiting to student success. CR-PBIS tries to address these concerns that are left untouched by the traditional PBIS framework by including families as a large piece of creating an environment for teaching and learning. =Responsive Classroom= Just like PBIS, Responsive Classroom (RC) centers on research- based approaches and strive to ensure high quality education to all students.Center for Responsive Classroom (n.d.). \\"Responsive classroom and PBIS: Can schools use them together?\\" Retrieved March 9, 2015. Both agree that these positive behaviors and the skills needed to reach them must be explicitly taught to students. Lastly, both also believe that non-punitive strategies are more effective than what has been used in schools in the past. Where PBIS is a framework that coaches the school staff to create their own resources and changes, RC outlines specific prescribed practices that schools should use to reach this goal. Responsive Classroom is a for-purchase-program that staff can be trained in at multiple levels and has published tools and strategies for meeting these goals with students.

Though developed and primarily used in education research, it has since been applied to other domains, including business and even tourism. Rather than focus on characteristics of the individual leader or features of the situation, distributed leadership foregrounds how actors engage in tasks that are \\"stretched\\" or distributed across the organization. With theoretical foundations in activity theory and distributed cognition, understanding leadership from a distributed perspective means seeing leadership activities as a situated and social process at the intersection of leaders, followers, and the situation. Background and origins Distributed leadership emerged in the early 2000s from sociological, cognitive, psychological, and anthropological theories, most importantly distributed cognition and activity theory, though also influenced by Wenger's communities of practice. It was conceived as a theoretical and analytical framework for studying school leadership, one that would explicitly focus attention on how leadership was enacted in schools, as an activity stretched across the \\"social and situational contexts.\\" Leadership research up through the late 1990s focused on the specific traits, functions, or effects of individual leaders. Much of the work done in educational research focused exclusively on the principal and centered around defining the heroics of individuals. Descriptions were written of what was being done but not how, which limited transferability across contexts. From this research it was unclear how leaders responded to the complex environment in schools. Though some research on leadership has continued to focus on the role or function of the designated leader, such as instructional leadership or transformational leadership, there has also be a significant shift to understanding leadership as a shared effort by more than one person. The latter constructs look more broadly at various roles that provide forms of leadership throughout the school, including teacher leadership, democratic leadership, shared leadership, or collaborative leadership. Distributed leadership draws on these multi-agent perspectives to describe how actors work to establish the conditions for improving teaching and learning in schools. Distributed leadership is not an activity, rather a procedureAli Key concepts Leadership is defined as any \\"activities tied to the core work of the organization that are designed by organizational members to influence the motivation, knowledge, affect, or practices of other organizational members.\\" Thus a leader is anyone who engages in these activities based on tasks, not position. As this definition implies, there is within an organization a group of people who are influenced by these leadership activities: these are the followers. Importantly, the role of a leader or follower is dynamic, and a person might be a follower in one situation but not in another. Additionally, followers are not passive recipients of these influences and followers may influence the leaders as well. =Leader Plus= The Leader Plus aspect posits leadership activity as a whole is stretched, or distributed, across many people. Leadership is often enacted with those not in official leadership positions, thus distributed leadership examines enactments of leadership activity rather than roles. The configurations of leadership activity might include collaborated, collective, or coordinated distribution. Collaborated distribution is where two or more leaders co-perform the leadership activity in the same place and time. In collective distribution, the performance of leadership actions is separate but the actions are interdependent. Coordinated distribution exists where the leadership activities are performed in a particular sequence. Leadership activities are dynamic and situated, thus these three categories do not correspond with particular types of activities or duties. This part of the framework foregrounds leadership activities and all individuals who contribute, avoiding the tendency to focus solely on designated leaders. =Practice= Practice is the product of interactions amongst leaders, followers, the situation over time. This is a key link to distributed cognition, where thinking and understanding is a process constituted of interactions with other people, tools, and routines, rather than independently. Research from a distributed perspective often takes a task-oriented approach as a way to break down practice into manageable units of analysis. Understanding how tasks are carried out and which are deemed important by leaders and followers gives a window into practice. This is a diagram to understand how leadership practice is stretched across leaders, followers, the situation, and time. =Situation= The situation comprises a complex web of material and social aspects of the environment, such as history, culture, physical environmental features, and policy environment, as well as more local aspects such as task complexity, organizational structure, or staff stability. The key here is to identify and focus on the \\"aspects of the situation that enable and constrain leadership practice but also captur[e] how they shape that practice.\\" Whereas Contingency Theory describes the situation as merely the context within which individuals act, a distributed perspective looks to the situation as constitutive, in the sense that it both influences and is influenced by the actions of the people in it. Two aspects of the situation that are often foregrounded in a distributed perspective are tools and routines. Tools are objects designed with a purpose toward enabling some action. Perhaps the most obvious example of a tool is a hammer. In organizations, however, tools might be a rubric for assessing teaching or an attendance checklist. They are not just accessories or incidentals; they both enable and constrain practice. Tools help focus the users attention but can also obscure other elements. The attendance taker might check off all those students present and think the task is complete but fail to notice a student that is present but not on the list. In this way, the tool is constitutive of the task, not just an accessory. A routine is a regular sequence or pattern of actions that happen in an organization. This may or may not align with the tools. For example, with a rubric for assessing teaching, the associated routine might be when and how an instructional leader observes a class, such as instructional rounds. Tools, routines, and other aspects of the situation might be locally designed, received, or inherited. Importantly, tools and routines take a portion of the cognitive load required to complete a task (see Distributed Cognition). In the example of the rubric for assessing teaching, the principal doing the observations will be prompted for what to pay attention to and the routine will improve a consistency to the observation practice. Thus the enactment of leaderships in this situation is distributed across the principal, the teacher being observed, and the routine. Foundational theories Distributed cognition sits at the intersection of psychology, sociology, and cognitive science. It is essentially the theory that knowledge and the thinking with that knowledge are stretched across the tools, situation, other people, and context. It originated with the work of anthropologist Edwin Hutchins in the 1990s with his studies of navigation on a naval aircraft carrier. His work on understanding naturally situated cognition led to the conclusion that cognition is socially distributed. Rather than looking for knowledge structures within an individual, his work showed that cognitive activity, or knowing what to do, was a situated process, influenced by other people, tools, and the situation. Leadership is often studied as something that is done or acted out by an individual. Social or shared leadership approaches often still see leadership as actions done by individuals, just done in cooperation with others. Taking a distributed perspective, in contrast, draws on the theory of distributed cognition to understand leadership is an emergent property of the system. In this way, it sits in between those who see leadership is a result of individual agency and those who see it as an outcome of the situation. Activity Theory is a broad social sciences approach to understanding human behavior as contextualized in a situation. This situated perspective expands the unit of analysis to the collective rather than individual and studies the relation between actions. Although this approach is aimed at understanding the individual, the unit of analysis is the broader system in which that individual participates. Engestrom identifies three generations of activity theory and associated researcher: first generation, a model focused on the individual (subject- object-mediating artifact) by Lev Vygotsky (1978); second generation, expansion of the model to include collective action, by Alexei Leont'ev (1981); and third generation, toward a networked understanding of interactive activity systems, proposed by Engestrom himself (1987). Another Activity Theory scholar, Barbara Rogoff expands this work in two ways: first, foregrounding of the individual must be done without losing sight of the interdependence of the system; and second, there are three different levels of resolution (interpersonal, cultural/community, and institutional/cultural planes) are needed to understand the different levels activity. A distributed perspective on leadership takes this networked and multi-level approach to give \\"context of action\\" and \\"maintain... the tension between agency and distribution. Additionally, Spillane and Gronn both draw on an application of activity theory in the field of leadership research that grew out of Mintzberg‚Äôs studies of work-activity, observing managers through structured observations to document what they actually do. While innovative and exciting at the time, the nature of this documentation was ultimately deemed shallow as it did not differentiate between what was managerial and non-managerial work, there were still unanswered questions about how management was enacted, and it did not explain leadership effectiveness. Understanding leadership from a distributed perspective means looking for leadership activity as situated and social process, drawing on both distributed cognition and activity theory. Usage of the term \\"Distributed leadership\\" entered the leadership and organizational theory discourse and clearly appealed to various scholars, policy makers, administrators, and practitioners as they have used it to frame, describe, and promote their work. Some use it as a recipe for effective leadership or improving schools; others use it to prescribe optimal leadership or organizational structure. The most common alternative usage is equating distributed leadership with more than one designated leader, ideas such as shared, democratic, or collaborative leadership. Studies along these lines often look at the distribution of leadership roles. Interest in these alternative organizational structures reflect the increased demands on leaders in schools and changes in the demands on educational organizations, and the term \\"distributed leadership\\" gets used to represent this. Some worry that this overlap in usage results in a watering down of ideas or rebranding of old ideas in new terms. A distinction that helps unravel the mixed usage is to distinguish between distributed leadership as a conceptual or analytical framework versus distributed leadership as a normative or practical framework. Taking an analytical perspective is to understand leadership activities as a product of the interactions amongst leaders, followers, and the situation. This reflects the roots of the framework in distributed cognition and activity theory. A practical or normative approach is concerned with optimizing the distribution of leadership so as to improve organizations. In this case, research is focused on the effects of certain configurations of leadership roles or activities. While the use of Distributed Leadership as a term will continue to evolve as scholarship on the topic continues to develop, this distinction is important in maintaining common epistemologies for researchers, policy makers, administrators, and practitioners.

The Australian tour that followed culminated in two gigs recorded at the Brisbane Powerhouse on 30/31 March 2002 and the resulting album was eventually released in 2004, under license to Compass Records. Recording The album opens with \\"My Heart's Tonight in Ireland\\", the band's re-working of the song that Irvine recorded solo on his album Rain on the Roof in 1996; the song then segues into \\"Robinson County/The Trip to Durrow\\", two tunes in time where Molsky and van der Zalm on fiddles combine American old- timey style and Irish traditional music. \\"Suleiman's Kopanitsa\\" is an adaptation of \\"Dance of Suleiman\\", recorded by Irvine on the album East Wind, where Davy Spillane's uilleann pipes played the main melodies with sustains, vibrato and occasional grace notes. This time round, though, all the melodic phrases are re-worked for string instruments emphasising the kopanitsa rhythm (2‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì2) with exquisitely crafted counter-harmonies from Irvine (mandola), van der Zalm (mandolin) and Lunny (bouzouki), augmented by Parov (gadulka and kaval) and Molsky (fiddle). \\"The Rocky Road to Dublin\\" is the American old- timey version first recorded in the 1920s by Allen Sisson and \\"Indian Ate the Woodchuck\\" comes from the American old-timey fiddler Ed Haley. \\"Romanian HorƒÉ\\" is a fiddle tune learnt from Jacky Molard and played by van der Zalm, followed by Molsky adding \\"Black Jack Grove\\" and its Blueridge mountains feel. \\"Sandansko Oro\\" is a slow Macedonian tune in time and is followed by \\"Menchin Kamen\\" in slow time (also from the album East Wind), sung here by Irvine. \\"Pony Boy\\" is a fiddle duet played by Molsky and van der Zalm to set the stage for \\"Never Tire of the Road\\", Irvine's tribute to his long-standing hero Woody Guthrie. In this rendition, Irvine adds Guthrie's chorus: \\"All of you fascists bound to lose\\". \\"A Blacksmith Courted Me\\" is the band's version of Irvine's \\"The Blacksmith\\" (with Molsky on 5-string banjo) followed, as usual, by \\"Blacksmithereens\\", a tune in time that Irvine wrote following his first impressions of Balkan music in 1968. Molsky starts \\"Field Holler Medley\\" by singing an American field call, followed by a couple of old West Virginia tunes: \\"Piney Woods\\" and \\"Lost Indian\\". \\"BƒÉneasƒÉ's Green Glade\\" is a song Irvine wrote while camping near a zoo in Bucharest in the late 1960s. It segues into \\"Roumen Sirakov's Daichevo\\", a Bulgarian dance tune in time. The band then launch into their arrangement of \\"Smeseno Horo\\" (\\"broken dance\\"), which Irvine first recorded with Planxty on After The Break and then again with Davy Spillane and Bill Whelan on the album East Wind. It is in mixed Bulgarian rhythms, beginning in time ( + ) and , then continuing in two different rhythms. The album closes with \\"The Last Dance\\", a Greek tune \\"that the bride dances at her wedding, bidding farewell to her girlhood\\". Parov leads the band on clarinet, playing it in the Epirus style. Track listing # \\"My Heart's Tonight in Ireland\\" (Andy Irvine) / \\"Robinson County\\"/\\"The trip to Durrow\\" (Trad. Arr.

She founded the Storckenfeldtska skolan (The Storchefeldt School) in J√∂nk√∂ping, and served as its principal in 1847‚Äì1891, during which time it was regarded as one of the best educational institutions for females in the nation. Storckenfeldt is regarded as an important member of the pioneers of girl's education in the mid 19th century Sweden, who reformed the education of girls by establishing girls' schools which offered proper academic education for females, in contrast to the earlier girl's pensions shallow education. Life Aurore Storckenfeldt was the daughter of the nobleman and captain Johan Adam Storckenfeldt and Magdalena Christina Uggla. She was given the education regarded appropriate for a female of her class at the time: French language, the Bible and etiquette. However, she was given private lessons by her vicar in academic subjects, which inspired her to become an autodidact. She is also believed to have been inspired by the works of Fredrika Bremer. After the death of her father, she supported herself as a governess. She was critical of the shallow education normally offered to women. In the 1840s, there were a growing demand of a reform of women's education to provide middle class women who were forced to support themselves with an education by which they could manage a profession suitable for their class and be useful for society. At the time of the introduction of the compulsory elementary school in Sweden in 1842, there were only five schools in Sweden to provide academic education and secondary education to females; Societetsskolan (1786), Fruntimmersf√∂reningens flickskola (1815) and Kjellbergska flickskolan (1833) in Gothenburg, Askersunds flickskola (1812) in Askersund and Wallinska skolan (1831) in Stockholm. In 1847, Aurore Storckenfeldt founded the Storchefeldt School in J√∂nk√∂ping with room for 20 students to meet the demand for higher academic education for potentially professional middle class women. She herself was a teacher of bible, history and English language. Described as strict but skillful and interested, she made study trips in Europe. The school became one of the most notable academic institutions for women in contemporary Sweden. She also occasionally accepted poor students who could not afford a fee. From 1874, the school was given government support in accordance of the Flickskolekommitt√©n 1866.

Before the nightly shows at 20:30 clock, on request a dinner can be taken that authentically is served by ladies who wear five petticoats under their skirts. In the initial phase, the program was cabaret and theater oriented; today it's more musical oriented, and so Edith Piaf chansons, Klezmer and Blues are played.

The film, released by Film Australia in 1989, contains extensive historic documentary footage and accounts by several participants, and was made possible by the release of previously highly restricted documents. A book of the same name, containing much additional material, was published in 1998. History In the later days of World War II evidence was found in Papua New Guinea of Japan's preparedness to use chemical weapons, in the form of bombs loaded with a mixture of mustard gas and lewisite. British and American military planners became acutely aware of their lack of knowledge about the effects of such materials on soldiers in tropical areas. An Australian Chemical Warfare Research & Experimental Section was formed in 1942 and a top- secret facility established in Queensland near Innisfail and later Proserpine, where a wide range of tests was performed by British, American and Australian researchers on volunteers from Australian defence personnel, with nurses and laboratory assistants recruited from the Australian Army Medical Women's Service. Initial tests proved that mustard gas was around four times as potent in tropical climates, with greatest aggravation to the skin occurring in the sweaty areas of the groin, buttocks, back of legs, neck and armpits. A large controlled environment stainless-steel gas chamber was designed by biochemists J. W. Legge and (later Professor Sir) Hugh Ennor to house volunteer subjects to ascertain the effectiveness of various materials and designs of protective clothing, during periods of physical exertion and after being subject to normal wear and tear. Other tests were conducted to determine the limits of endurance of soldiers in performing arduous tasks after bodily exposure to mustard gas. Gas masks or respirators were used to minimise inhalation of the gas. The determined resistance put up by Japanese soldiers against the Americans in their assault on Tarawa in November 1943 prompted the US Army, which had sustained terrible losses in taking the island, to make plans for use of chemical weapons in further attacks of the kind. General Douglas MacArthur was in favor of this approach, heavy naval bombardment having been unexpectedly ineffective at lowering the enemy's resistance. Brook Island, off the Queensland coast around 30 km east of Cardwell, was prepared with various forms of tunnel and foxhole to simulate the kind of emplacements used by the Japanese army, and goats tethered in these locations. Bombers then carpeted the island with mustard gas bombs and the following day unprotected Australian soldiers were landed on the island to assess the damage, and spent 12 hours there, suffering some lung damage and blisters where their bodies came into contact with contaminated foliage. The Allies never used gas against the enemy, as Japan surrendered following the dropping of atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Chemical Warfare Unit was top secret and its very existence was denied for many years. Many of the volunteers had never served overseas, and so did not receive the monitoring and preferential health treatment accorded other ex-servicemen by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Mustard gas is known to damage DNA by alkylation, and it has been suggested that the experiments were responsible for adverse long-term health effects on some of these volunteers. Recognition The film was in 1989 Highly Commended in the Walkley Awards for Australian Journalism. It was a finalist for the UN Media Peace Prize The author Bridget Goodwin was a journalist working for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation before turning her hand to documentary film making. She has also produced documentary films about the author Hugh Lunn, the Henry Lawson Festival in Grenfell, New South Wales and Professor Manning Clark.

She was born in Oradea. Her father Petre was a Romanian Orthodox priest active in the church school system in Oradea and a protopope in Beliu, who later settled in Ucuri»ô. Her mother Maria was a poet. The family home at Ucuri»ô hosted a small literary circle attended by George Co»ôbuc, Gheorghe Bogdan-DuicƒÉ and Aurel Popovici. Lucre»õia, a cultivated woman who knew French, German and Hungarian, made her debut in 1884 in Familia, with the poem \\"Suvenir\\" (\\"Souvenir\\"). She regularly published poems in the magazine until 1895. In 1889, she published her collected poems in a single volume printed at Sibiu, also publishing poems in Tribuna and a translation of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Laoco√∂n. She married Wilhelm Rudow, who had obtained a doctorate in philosophy at Halle University; a philo-Romanian, he wrote a German-language history of Romanian literature. From April to November 1897 at Oradea, the couple published Foaia literarƒÉ, a weekly magazine that ran for 30 editions. Its contributors included Co»ôbuc, Maria Cun»õan and Ilarie Chendi.Marian Petcu, Istoria jurnalismului »ôi a publicitƒÉ»õii √Æn Rom√¢nia, p. 38. Editura Polirom, 2007, Her own submissions included verses and a romantic tale, Logodnica contelui Stuart (\\"Count Stuart's Betrothed\\"). Her work was popularized by Convorbiri Literare, which printed a number of her poems in 1898. Its patron Titu Maiorescu saw in her verses the sure signs of a Transylvanian cultural renaissance. Another review where she appeared was the Arad-based Tribuna poporului. Her last years were marked by suffering from tuberculosis.StƒÉnu»õa Cre»õu, Dic»õionarul literaturii rom√¢ne de la origini p√ÆnƒÉ la 1900, p. 821. Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste Rom√¢nia, 1979 Suciu- Rudow's work consisted almost of love poetry. According to one critic, she possessed an authentic sensibility, sharply heightened by her illness and by a strong sentimental disappointment. She was influenced by Mihai Eminescu, from whom she borrowed motifs, images and rhythms, reproducing their atmosphere. However, she went beyond mere imitation: her lines were charged with sincerity, spontaneity and a characteristically feminine delicacy and grace. German Romantic poets such as Nikolaus Lenau and Heinrich Heine, whom she knew very well, were another influence, as seen through her light melancholy, pained regret caused by incomprehension, faded love and resignation. Her tone was consistently one of romantic sentimentalism, and she surpassed all prior Transylvanian female lyric poets through her musicality, elegant language and discretion. At times, her verses have the liveliness of Co»ôbuc's rhythms, and the theme of darkness recalls his \\"V√¢ntul\\" and \\"Prahova\\". Several of her poems, such as \\"La drum\\" (\\"On the Road\\"), point to greater potential through their naturalness, pictorial images and adequate rhythm. Maiorescu, commenting about \\"La scaldƒÉ\\" (\\"Bathing\\"), noted its \\"carefree naturalism, almost at the level of ancient liberties\\", while Nicolae Iorga found that the same sonnet could be compared to Victor Hugo's \\"Sara la baigneuse\\".

He was deputy head of the National Guard under his friend and mentor Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz and was later Chief of the Crown Prince's Court when the Prince was Heir Apparent and later Regent. He was succeeded by his son Khaled, who himself became de facto prime minister of Saudi Arabia. Career Abdulaziz al- Tuwaijri first met Prince Abdullah in the 1950s, when the latter was made head of the National Guard by then King Saud. At the time, the Guard was an extremely small and disorganized force and the position was meant as a sop while the King and Crown prince Feisal were locked in a deadly power struggle. Al-Tuwaijri advised the Prince to turn what might be a dead-end nominal position into a real opportunity to get real power. Intrigued, Prince Abdullah brought Al-Tuwaijri on board as his deputy, and over the years the two created a modern and sophisticated force. They not only developed its military capabilities, but also ensured its members were provided with top-class housing, medical care and education. This transformed the National Guard into an independent empire loyal to Abdullah. To many the success of the National Guard was due to the hard work and foresight of al-Tuwaijri, who became Prince Abdullah's close confidant and special advisor. While known to be completely loyal to the Saudi absolute monarchy, al-Tuwaijri was also known to have Ba'athist sympathies. He was friends with Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. During Saudi ‚Äì Egyptian tensions over competing regional interests, Tuawijri demonstrated his excellent political skills by acting as a go-between of Nasser and King Faisal and publicly supporting both sides. Tuwaijri shied away from the media spotlight. Some joked that he didn't exist because while they had heard of his influence they had never actually seen him. Following the murder of King Faisal in 1975, Prince Abdullah was appointed second deputy prime minister, and al Tuwaijri continued as his top aide and advisor, and when Abdullah became Crown Prince, he became chief of the Crown Prince Court. As a \\"secularist\\" and \\"progressive\\", al Tuwaijri now incurred the wrath of the Wahabbist/Salafist faction in the Saudi government, but Abdullah kept him at his side when he became Regent in the 1990s. He became the most powerful non- royal citizen in the country until he retired in 2005.

Rose Cumming was born on an Australian sheep station in New South Wales. In 1917 she came to New York with her sister, silent-screen actress Dorothy Cumming. Following advice of her friend Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, Cumming decided to become a decorator. She worked for Mary Buehl before opening her own shop in 1921. Cumming's shop was her decorating office and a retail shop for antiques and fabrics. She put her best furniture in the window of the shop left the lights on at night, which nobody had ever done. Her shop sold Bromo- Seltzer bottles and empty candy boxes alongside fine French furniture. As she explained, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all salesmanship.\\" She was known for chinoiserie, displayed in the Chinese wallpapers of her often-photographed drawing room, and for baroque and rococo Venetian, South German and Austrian furniture, at a time when conservative New York tastes ran to Louis XV and English Georgian furnishings. Her color sense favored saturated, dramatic tones. She brought chintz to informal dressing rooms and bedrooms, inaugurated the vogue for smoked mirrors veined with gold and extended her love of reflective and lacquered surfaces to lacquered walls, satin upholstery and the metallic wallpapers she invented. In Cumming's own town house, the living room had early-eighteenth-century hand-painted Chinese wallpaper with a silvery background and Louis XV furniture. Conventional lamps were one of her pet hates, so black candles lighted the room. At the top of her townhouse was the infamous ‚ÄúUgly Room‚Äù filled with predatory images of snakes, vultures, boars and monkeys. Her clients included Marlene Dietrich, Mary Pickford, and Norma Shearer. She designed and printed fabrics. Her sister Eileen Cecil, a former editor of Harpers Bazaar, stylist, and advertising force in her own right, carried on the business after Cumming's death in 1968. Later the merchandise line was leased to Dessin Fournir, and currently to Wells Abbott. Her great- niece Sarah Cumming Cecil carried on the atelier \\"Rose Cumming Design\\", now based in Portland, ME, presenting a stripped-down simplified style.Rose Cumming Design.

The monument became a subject of controversy as its construction displaced indigenous Ibaloi residents in the sparsely populated area, and the land reportedly forced to be sold at very low prices. The monument was destroyed in December 2002, with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New Peoples Army taking credit for its destruction. Bust The hollow bust measured high and was made of concrete. History Around 1978, the bust's construction began along Marcos Highway. The bust was constructed by the Philippine Tourism Authority and was meant to be the centerpiece of the Marcos Park that would include a golf course, sports club, convention center, and hotel. The bust was positioned near the peak of Mt. Shontoug so it could be seen by Baguio-bound motorists as far as away from the monument. Father and son, Anselmo Dayag Sr. and Anselmo Jr. were chosen to design the bust but the former died due to disease. Scaffolding covered with plywood was reportedly erected to deliberately hide the bust's construction from the public. A typhoon later blew the scaffolding away, exposing the bust. The Ibaloi in the affected area were said to have been displaced due to the bust's construction. It was reported that they were forced to sell their lands for outrageously low prices. The bust was completed around 1980. After the People Power Revolution of 1986, the Ibaloi peoples slaughtered a pig and carabao and poured the animals' blood into the bust to \\"exorcise\\" it and later filed a case to reclaim their land. The bust was bombed in 1989 by leftist rebels and sustained cracks and other minor damage. The bust was subjected to controversy and was viewed as self-glorification, especially by critics of the Marcos administration. The displaced Ibalois viewed it as a symbol of their mistrust for government authorities since the construction of the bust displaced them from their lands. Communist insurgents also criticized the bust's construction, and many groups planned to destroy the bust. =Destruction= The bust was destroyed using dynamite before dawn on December 29, 2002 by suspected treasure hunters who thought that the bust contained parts of the rumored Yamashita treasure. Benguet Governor Raul Mencio Molintas said that the police learned that a white Toyota FX van was around the area prior to the incident. It was initially thought that the New People's Army was behind the bombing of the monument. The rebel group's Chadli Molintas Command claimed responsibility for the incident in a press release a day later. The communists said that the bust's mere existence \\"is a mockery of justice and a betrayal of the will of the people. ... Let the ruins be an ugly reminder that the Marcoses have yet to pay for their crimes.\\" Some critics of Marcos criticized the destruction of the monument. Archbishop Oscar Cruz of Lingayen-Dagupan said that the perpetrators \\"should have never destroyed the monument to evil in this country\\", describing the bust as \\"a monument to evil, warning people never to become what this man was\\". Rehabilitation In 2003, Baguio city mayor Ramon Labo Jr. made an offer to the Marcos family to restore the bust. Imelda Marcos, the wife of Ferdinand Marcos, treated the offer as a kind gesture, but stated that any move to fix the monument should be a \\"collective decision of the Marcoses and their supporters\\". Bongbong Marcos, the son of the former president, said the family did not feel the need to have the bust fixed despite the offer.

He is the co-founder and dean of Kollel Torah V'Chaim in Bnei Brak, and serves as president of dozens of Torah institutions. He is also a senior leader of the Shas political party and a member of that party's Moetzet Chachmei HaTorah rabbinical leadership council. Early life and education Shimon Baadani was born in 1928 in Hadera, Mandatory Palestine. His parents, Dawid and Haviva Baadani, were both natives of Yemen who had had ten children in their homeland, of whom only two sons and one daughter survived. Shimon was their eleventh and last child. Due to the absence of Torah institutions in Hadera, Baadani's parents initially sent him to a Mafdal (Religious Zionist) school that provided religious education. Baadani went on to attend the Novardok yeshiva in Hadera before transferring to the Beis Yosef-Novardok yeshiva in Jerusalem, where Rabbi Elazar Shach was serving as rosh yeshiva. After several years, Baadani moved to the Ponevezh Yeshiva in Bnei Brak and then to Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem, then led by rosh yeshiva Ezra Attiya. Following the destruction of the Porat Yosef Yeshiva building in the Old City, Baadani was asked to form a branch of the yeshiva in the Katamon neighborhood for the benefit of newly-arrived Mizrahi Jewish immigrants. This branch later became an independent yeshiva, also led by Baadani. Career Baadani co-founded Kollel Torah V'Chaim in Bnei Brak together with Rabbi Moshe Pardo. He has taught many students who went on to serve as rabbis, rosh yeshivas, dayanim (rabbinical judges), and morei horaah (halakhic arbiters) in Israel and the world. Baadani is also the president of \\"dozens\\" of Torah institutions. Beginning in the 1970s, Baadani involved himself in strengthening the Jewish communities of Latin America. At the urging of Rabbi David Kassin, an officer at Congregation Keter Torah in Mexico City, Baadani sent his student Rabbi Chaim Harari to establish a yeshiva in that city. Baadani visited Argentina at the end of the 20th century, encouraging Jewish families to send their sons to yeshivas in Israel. He regularly travels to Mexico and Panama to encourage those communities as well. Political views Baadani at a cornerstone-laying ceremony in Harish, Israel, 2015 Baadani was involved in the formation of the Shas party in 1984. He is a member of the party's Moetzet Chachmei HaTorah rabbinical leadership council. Baadani has often elicited controversy for his outspokenness on political matters. He is unafraid to speak his mind even if his comments will be contentious. After sitting in the government of Ehud Barak from 1999 to 2001, Baadani said it was like \\"living in Sodom\\". He attacked Shas' coalition partners in the Netanyahu government of 2013‚Äì2015, calling Yair Lapid \\"Amalek\\" and the Religious Zionist rabbis and leaders of The Jewish Home \\"animals, idiots\\". In 2006 he suggested that the reason for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke was because Sharon had aligned himself with the secular Shinui party. He added that those who did not vote for Shas in the elections would go to hell. In June 2008 Baadani was openly critical of the Tel Aviv Pride Parade, stating: \\"So much dirt on the street and making it proud? There was no such thing in the Jewish people. It's disgusting\\". Personal life Baadani is known for his simple lifestyle and demeanor. He makes himself available to petitioners at his home and by phone; he has a listed number and answers the phone himself. He does not have his own association or central fund, but assists widows from his personal bank account and provides tefillin for orphaned boys celebrating their Bar Mitzvah. He has been successful in the area of shidduchim (marriage matches); among the matches he has suggested are those of Torah leaders, notably Rishon Letzion Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron. He has set aside one room of his house for a matchmaking organization and pays the salaries of the shadchanim himself. Baadani married Shulamit Abadai, with whom he had seven children. His sons are Rabbi David Yeshaya Baadani, rosh kollel of Kollel Taharot in Jerusalem, established by his father; Rabbi Moshe Baadani, a rosh chaburah (study group leader) in the kollel; and Rabbi Chaim Baadani, director of Torah V'Chaim institutions. He also has four daughters. In 2014, Baadani's 17-year-old grandson Shalom Aharon Baadani, son of Rabbi David Yeshaya Baadani, was killed by a Palestinian terrorist in a vehicular attack near a Jerusalem Light Rail station.

Biography She was born as Catherine Uhlmyer in Manhattan, New York on April 4, 1893. Her father died before she was a year old, and her mother, Veronica, married John Gallagher. On June 15, 1904 when she was 11 years old, she was one of the passengers aboard the General Slocum when it caught fire on the East River in New York City. She remembered a boy shouting \\"fire\\" while a brass band was playing on the deck of the ship to entertain the travelers. She recounted the images of mothers and children with their clothing on fire drowning in the rough waters of Hell Gate. Others were killed as they were drawn into the blades of the paddlewheel. The total death count was 1,021 of the 1,331 passengers who were on a Sunday school outing, and among the victims were her mother, her nine-year-old brother Walter, and her 9-month-old sister Agnes. \\"Sometimes he is very cruel, the man upstairs,\\" she said in her interview with The New York Times on May 24, 1989, when she was already 96. This remained the largest single disaster in New York until the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 1913, she married Thomas Connelly, a truck driver. She had 11 children. Ten of them were born at home. Only two were alive at the time of her death, Jeanette Connelly Meehan, who lived in Goshen, New York, and Elizabeth Gallagher Reilly, who lived in Greenwich, Connecticut. She was also survived by 27 grandchildren, 30 great-grandchildren and 7 great- great-grandchildren. She lived in a Manhattan apartment by herself until she was 102. She then moved to a nursing home in Connecticut to be closer to her daughter Elizabeth.

Statistics  As of 2017, the most recent statistics available regarding abortion in Belize are from 1996. During that year, 2603 abortions were reported, along with 6678 live births. 5% of hospitalizations were due to abortion during that year, making it the 4th highest cause of hospitalization. Due to legal restrictions against abortion, as well as its significant financial cost, illegal abortions are common in Belize, especially for low- income women. In 1998, an estimated one in seven maternal deaths in Belize were due to unsafe, illegal abortions.  Legal status  Abortion in Belize is governed by sections 108‚Äì110 of the Criminal Code (enacted December 1980). Abortion is considered a criminal offense except when performed by a registered medical practitioner under certain conditions. The sentence for performing an illegal abortion in Belize is life imprisonment. Abortion is permitted under the following circumstances: * To protect the life of the mother * To protect the physical or mental health of the mother or any existing children of her family * If there is substantial risk that the child will be severely handicapped In addition, the law states that \\"account may be taken of the pregnant woman's actual or reasonably foreseeable environment\\", suggesting that abortions can be performed on socio-economic grounds.

Since 2019, he has been Professor of Economics at New York University Abu Dhabi. He was Professor of Economics at Trinity College, Dublin from 2000 to 2011, and had previously taught at Columbia University and University College, Dublin. From 2011 to 2019, he was Chichele Professor of Economic History at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. Early life and education O'Rourke was born on 25 March 1963 in Bern, Switzerland. His father, Andrew O'Rourke, was a senior Irish diplomat who had served as ambassador to the UK and France among others. From 1980 to 1984, he studied economics and maths at Trinity College Dublin, and was elected a Scholar of the College in 1982.

His dissertation was titled \\"Agricultural Change and Rural Depopulation: Ireland 1845‚Äì76\\". Using computable general equilibrium techniques, and detailed statistics on the Irish economy collected by the UK administration, he challenged the hypothesis that Ireland's Great Famine was merely an inevitable acceleration of existing trends. His work showed that rural depopulation was not linked to relative price changes for agricultural goods,O'Rourke, K. (1991). Did the great Irish famine matter?. The Journal of Economic History, 51(1), 1-22. rather that it was driven by a (sudden, Famine- induced) change in the structure of the agricultural industry, in particular the use of potato as an input,O'Rourke, K. (1994). The economic impact of the famine in the short and long run. The American Economic Review, 84(2), 309-313. as well as greater opportunities for Irish labourers abroad, in particular in the USA, due to the again-sudden existence of emigrant networks and information flows back to Ireland.Boyer, G.

(2009). Power and plenty: trade, war, and the world economy in the second millennium (Vol. 30). Princeton University Press.

SDSS J0100+2802 is about four times more luminous than SDSS J1148+5251, and seven times more luminous than ULAS J1120+0641, the most distant quasar known, although it is only less than fourth as luminous as HS 1946+7658, the most luminous quasar known. It harbors a black hole with mass of 12 billion solar masses (estimated according to MgII emission line correlations).

It is the most ancient symbol of Christianity in Sri Lanka.  The cross  The cross was discovered in 1912 during archaeological excavations in Anuradhapura. It is cut in sunk relief on the side of a smooth granite column of which a fragment was excavated. An immediate determination about the cross came from the Archaeological Commissioner of Ceylon, Edward R. Ayrton, who concluded that it was a Portuguese cross. In 1924, Ayrton's successor, Arthur Maurice Hocart, put more effort to clarify the cross and he described it in his publication, Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon, as being \\"a cross of a floret type standing on a stepped pedestal from which emanates two fronds on each side of the cross like horns\\". Hocart also concluded it was a Portuguese cross. Both men considered that it was a Nestorian cross or \\"Persian Cross\\" from the Portuguese era. A number of historical records also suggest that Assyrian Church of the East may have been in Sri Lanka between the middle fifth and sixth centuries. There, it is believed that the cross was dated to the Anuradhapura period. Meanwhile, whilst it was considered as a Portuguese cross these claims are questionable given various historic facts, notably that the Portuguese did not have a presence in Anuradhapura at the time. The most conclusive determination of the cross's origins was made in 1926 by Humphrey Codrington, based on evidence contained in a 6th-century manuscript, Christian Topography, that a community of Persian Christians were known to reside in Taproban√™ (the Ancient Greek name for Sri Lanka). Codrington wrote in his book, A Short History of Ceylon, that \\"about A.D. 500 we read of a Persian colony; a Nestorian cross undoubtedly belonging to this community is to be seen in the Anuradhapura museum\\". In 1954 the then assistant Archaeological Commissioner, Titus Devendra, dismissed the historical reliability of the Christian Topography and attributed the cross to the Portuguese dating it later than 1547. Academics however have since concluded that the Christian Topography is historically accurate. In 1984 an archaeological find at Manthai confirmed the existence of Persian Christians in Sri Lanka, including a seal with a Nestorian cross, with similar stylistic features to the Anuradhapura cross.  Symbology  The cross is considered as a variation of the St Thomas Cross due to its similar shape and possible links between the early Christian community in South India and Sri Lanka. The Anuradhapura cross however has unique features when compared to other crosses. The three main elements that the Anuradhapura cross has in common with Nestorian crosses are: the \\"leaves\\" (with their upward facing fronds) at the base of the cross, which symbolize the \\"tree of life\\" (the vitality of the tree is accentuated by its fruit-like protrusions); the second element is that each of the arms of the cross terminate in a pearl. Pearls played a central theme in Syriac devotional literature and iconography. The third element is the base, which is a three- stepped pedestal. The three tiers symbolise the three levels of paradise, the three decks of the ark, and the three limits of ascent to Sinai.  Popular use  The Anuradhapura cross was featured in the official logo of Pope Francis' visit to Sri Lanka. The website of Archdiocese of Colombo mentions the cross as the Glorious Cross or the Cross of the Resurrection. The Diocese of Kurunegala (Church of Ceylon) has the cross on its emblem.

In this episode, David and Mary Margaret investigate Ursula and Cruella; and Regina and Henry ask Marco and Pinocchio for help, while flashbacks show Snow and David's past with the Queens of Darkness and a dark secret that needs to be hidden. Plot =Opening Sequence= A dragon flies through the forest. =In the Characters' Past= In the Enchanted Forest, pre-first curse, Snow White and Charming ride back to their castle after their honeymoon to discover everyone in town has been struck by a sleeping spell. They call out for Regina, only to have Maleficent appear to admit the spell was her doing. She then introduces her associates Cruella and Ursula, and says that they have come to make a deal. The Queens tell Snow and Charming that Regina has stolen the darkest curse from Maleficent, and that the tree of wisdom and it can tell them how to defeat Regina and the curse, but it will only answer to two of the most valiant heroes. As they reach the location of the tree of wisdom, Snow and Charming each place a hand on a designated rock nearby and they ask how to stop the Regina's curse. The tree lights up with gold and then red and they are blown backward. Maleficent reveals that Snow is pregnant, and says that, while they may be heroes, their daughter has the potential to either become good or evil, and could become the darkest villain the realm has ever seen. Maleficent later visits Snow White and says that she, too, is expecting a child, and that they need to work together to stop Regina and the Dark Curse from harming their children and the land. Snow declines Maleficent's offer due to the latter being a villain, and tells her that they will not turn to darkness to ensure the safety of the kingdom. =In Storybrooke= Mary Margaret has a nightmare wherein Maleficent threatens her family; she wakes and finds David sitting on the stairs drinking whisky, struggling to sleep with the new villains in town. They attempt to come up with a plan to make the Queens leave Storybrooke before their secret is revealed. The following morning at Granny's diner, Cruella and Ursula remind others of Regina's formerly wicked ways in front of Henry, prompting Regina to threaten them with expulsion from town. Emma Swan and Captain Hook enter, and Hook is startled by Ursula, with whom he shares a secretive past. Queens visit Gold's pawn shop, where they receive an unwelcome greeting from Belle. They steal a wooden box and head to the cave where Gold is hiding. After David and Emma sees the Queens leave the shop, Emma calls Belle and learns that a box disappeared from the shop. David and Emma stop the Queens and David searches the vehicle, discovering the box a jeweled bauble it contains. He takes the bauble but tells Emma there was nothing in the car. He later informs Mary Margaret that the Queens are planning to bring back Maleficent through a resurrection spell, which gives Mary Margaret a plan to keep her from coming back to life. The Charmings lie about going on a hike while actually going to the tunnels where Maleficent was once slain. As they come upon Maleficent's ashes, they are knocked out by Ursula's tentacles, allowing Cruella to slice their hands to take a sample of their blood. She then pours the blood of the people who had wronged Maleficent on the ashes, and it is revealed that the stolen box was bait to lure the two into a trap planned by Gold. The ashes then swirl until a dragon is formed, which crashes towards the ground, and Maleficent reappears in human form. Maleficent informs Mary Margaret that she is not worried about their secret, since her goal is to see her family suffer and revel in their pain until the time comes when they meet again. After the reunited Queens disappear, David tells Mary Margaret it is time to tell Emma the truth. Meanwhile, Emma is still pressing Hook about his past with Ursula, and admits that they had an ugly history. While Emma believes she can trust Hook to tell her when the time comes, she begins to start questioning her parents' motives, which they overhear. They then come into the office with news that Maleficent has reappeared in Storybrooke, giving Emma more concern about the Queens' plans for revenge, with Mary Margaret reminding Emma that they are heroes and the Queens are villains. Regina and Henry are scouring the fairy tale book for clues to the author's identity. They come across additional pages about Pinocchio, suggesting that, before he reverted to his form as normal boy, August Booth may have known about the author. Regina decides to bring both the boy and Marco into the office. When Emma stops by to see Regina, she asks her to see if he can remember his life before returning to a boy but Pinocchio has no memory of being August and Regina snaps at him, infuriating Marco, who asks why she deserves a happy ending. She reminds him that he lied his way into bringing Pinocchio into the real world and Marco warns Regina to stay away from Pinocchio; hours later she stops by Marco's shop to apologize, and Marco gives her a bag of August's belongings, in which Henry later discovers a page with an illustration of a door and a note that reads \\"Author.\\" At the town limits, Regina meets with Mary Margaret to come up with a plan to find out about what the Queens are plotting, and suggest that Regina get close to them. As Regina asks Mary Margaret about the reason for this, Mary Margaret tells her that, back in the Enchanted Forest, they made a deal with Maleficent that resulted in her betraying the sorceress. It turns out that because Emma was born with the potential for great darkness, they took steps to prevent their daughter from turning evil, and caused Maleficent to lose her child. At the same time, Gold watches Belle from the window of the pawn shop, and is stunned to see Will kissing his wife, while Maleficent puts together a totem and conjures up a baby rattle. Reception =Ratings= The episode was off slightly from the previous outing with a 2.1/6 among 18-49s with 6.60 million viewers tuning in. =Reviews= The episode was met with mixed to positive reviews. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a good review: \\"Tonight's Once happily revealed David and Mary Margaret's secret to us, but in a confusing move, they decided to keep concealing the truth from Emma.

It was designed by George Gerald Hutton and built from 1914 to 1922. It is also known as former Administration Building, Queensland Government Insurance Building, and Queensland Government Savings Bank. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Family Services Building, circa 1922 Royal coat of arms sculpture over the entrance on the corner of George and Elizabeth Streets, 2015 Brisbane's first high-rise government office building was constructed between 1914 and 1922. It was intended partly as general public offices, but more importantly as state headquarters for the enormously successful Queensland Government Savings Bank, established in 1864. Bank headquarters had occupied a purpose-designed banking chamber and offices in the second wing of the Treasury Building from early 1893. By 1912 these premises were no longer adequate. In consequence, the Queensland Government decided to construct a separate and substantial building on the opposite corner of George and Elizabeth Streets, as new bank headquarters. George Gerald Hutton, assistant architect in the Queensland Government Architect's office from 1913‚Äì22, is credited with the design. It is likely Hutton also designed the sculpture, representing commerce and industry, on the George Street elevation. This and the royal coat of arms on the George-Elizabeth Street corner were carved in 1920 by Sydney sculptor William Priestly MacIntosh, who had carved an allegorical sculpture for the former Executive Building (later the Land Administration Building) in 1903-04. The shields of the parapet were carved by local masons under MacIntosh's supervision. Site excavation and the concrete foundations were completed in 1913-14, at a cost of . In 1914 the contract for the superstructure was let for , and construction commenced that year. A shortage of structural steel prolonged the work, and completion took close to eight years. Before the building was finished, the Queensland Labor Government transferred the business and assets of the state bank to the Commonwealth Bank, on 8 December 1920. The nearly completed, purpose-designed Queensland state bank headquarters building was then fitted out for the Queensland Government Insurance Office. By 1921 the offices had been renamed the Queensland Government Insurance Building. It was completed and fully occupied by mid-1922, with the State Government Insurance Office (SGIO) occupying the basement, ground, and first to third floors. Other first occupants included the State Land Tax Office, the State Industrial Arbitration Court, the Public Service Commissioner, the Public Curator and the Main Roads Board. Most of these had removed from cramped quarters in the Treasury Building opposite. Accommodated on the roof was the State Time Station's observing room. From 1925-26 Queensland's first official radio broadcaster, the Queensland Radio Service and station 4QG (Queensland Government), which had been established in July 1925, were located in rooms on the roof of the Queensland Government Insurance Building. This necessitated the installation of large aerials on the roof, which were not removed until after 1945. Both 4QG and the Postmaster General's radio station broadcast from the building during the 1930s. From 1930 to 1932, 4QG was part of Australia's first national radio network, the privately owned Australian Broadcasting Company Ltd. In mid-1932 the licence was transferred to the federal government's newly created Australian Broadcasting Commission. In 1931 the SGIO removed to other premises and the building was occupied principally by the Land and Income Tax Department. Despite income tax being transferred to federal control c.1943, the office block was known as the Taxation Building until 1962. In 1947 the original lift and concrete staircase in the George Street vestibule were removed, and replaced with a pair of lifts. In 1962 the building was occupied by the Co-ordinator-General's Department and renamed the Administration Building. With the new tenancy, the George Street vestibule was refitted and the original lift in the Elizabeth Street vestibule was replaced. From 1963 to 1984 the Health Department was a principal occupant of the Administration Building. Since 1988 the building has been occupied by Family Services, and takes its name from this department. In 1990 the Elizabeth Street vestibule was partly refurbished.  Description  Arched pediment, George Street facade, 2015 Panelling and timber-and-glass doors, entrance vestibule, Family Services Building, 2015 Mosaic tiled floor with State Government Insurance Office logo in entrance vestibule, 2020 Decorative ironwork on security doors and windows, 2015 The building situated at the corner of George and Elizabeth Streets consists of eight storeys, a basement and rooms on the roof level. The structure, a concrete encased steel frame with brick infill and reinforced concrete floors, is faced on the two street facades with Helidon sandstone sitting on a granite base. The northeast and southeast elevations are constructed of brick with reinforced concrete heads and sills. The building which overlooks Queens Gardens to the southwest forms part of the group of important government buildings, including the Lands Administration Building, the Treasury Building and the Old State Library, which surround the park. The Elizabeth and George Street facades are divided vertically, by projecting stone cornices, into three parts. These are a podium level consisting of the double height ground floor and the first level of offices, a five storeyed middle section and the top floor of the building surmounted by a parapet wall. At the corners of the street elevations pavilions, distinguished by banded rustication, extend from the ground floor to the parapet. The podium level is also marked by banded rustication. In the centre of the George Street elevation on the podium level is an arched open- bed semicircular pediment supporting a sculpture group that consists of two figures on either side of a shield. The division between the middle and top section of the George Street elevation is embellished by an open-topped semicircular pediment. Steel windows frames and sashes are used throughout the building. Pavement lights are located adjacent to the arched basement windows of the Elizabeth Street elevation. Public entrances are located on the ground floor of the three corner pavilions. The entrance on the corner of George and Elizabeth Streets leads into the former banking chamber. The George Street entrance and the Elizabeth Street entrance give access to the office levels. The Elizabeth street entry opens onto a vestibule which has walls and columns finished in pink, grey and black marble arranged in rectilinear patterns, marble steps, a terrazzo floor and an enriched plaster ceiling, cornice and frieze. The lift enclosure has been paint finished to match the marble walls. The doors leading to the banking chamber have been replaced by a fire door. A fire door at the rear of the vestibule leads to a large square planned reinforced concrete staircase with an ornamental wrought iron balustrade and cedar handrail. The walls above the staircase are lined to dado height with large glazed green tiles. The stairwell, illuminated by a large roof lantern and arched windows, has been converted to a fire isolated exit separated from the office space. A smaller staircase, with similar but less ornate details, is located in the eastern corner of the building and opens onto the banking chamber. The George Street entry vestibule, once identical to the Elizabeth Street vestibule, is fitted with varnished maple panelling, a suspended vermiculite ceiling and two lifts. Original glass and timber doors between the vestibule and the banking chamber are all that remain of the original fittings. Two arched stone doorways on the George and Elizabeth Streets corner lead to a mosaic tiled vestibule with a domed plaster ceiling and a timber panelled screen wall enriched with carving and pilasters. Built into the screen are two sets of timber and glass double doors that open onto the former banking chamber. This grand double height room is now obscured by two levels of offices that have been built into the space. The lower section of the walls is lined with carved timber panelling while the rendered upper section is embellished with delicate plaster detailing. Ionic columns and pilasters support a richly ornamented plaster ceiling. All the office floors, from the first floor to the top floor, are similar. An open plan with large columns is divided by modern office partitioning and suspended ceilings conceal the original ceilings. Heavily reinforced concrete strong rooms and safes are located in the basement with smaller strong rooms on each floor. The lightwell, on the southeast side of the building, contains steel fire escape stairs and steel and concrete walkways. A brick and concrete extension accessed from the walkway has been built into the lightwell and the large windows to the banking chamber and offices have been bricked in. Former photographic rooms, the staircase lantern, toilets, stores, elevator and plant enclosures, are located on the flat roof of the building. The exterior of the building is intact. The interior while apparently much altered retains many original features, both visible and obscured.

Cornelius Flagg, a farmer and lumber businessman from Ohio, established the farm in the 1870s. The farmhouse, the farm's main building, is a two-story brick Italianate building. The house has an asymmetrical pattern with hip roofs over each component. Several of its key Italianate features are not original; the wraparound front porch was replaced in 1930, and its bracketed cornice was reconstructed in the 1940s after tornadoes damaged the roof. The farm's brick barn is unusually well-crafted for a barn built during the period, a sign of Flagg's wealth. Other buildings on the farm include a machinery shed, a smaller and older farmhouse, a privy, and an ice house. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 3, 1993.

It is one of the tallest orchids found in Western Australia as well as one of the most common and widespread. It often flowers in large numbers after a bushfire and has a relatively long flowering period. Description The tall leek orchid is a tuberous perennial herb growing to a height of 0.3-1.2 m, sometimes 1.50 m. It has a single leaf, up to 120 cm long and a flower spike crowded, often with up to 60 flowers. The flowers are pale yellowish-green to brownish or purplish black and faintly fragrant with the sepal at the back of the flower up to 11 mm long. The flowers appear from August to October. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum elatum was first described in 1810 by Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. John Lindley noted in his 1840 book The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants that \\"My Swan River specimens of this are from 3 to 4 feet [90-100 cm] high, with a spike of flowers 9 inches [23 cm] long\\". The specific epithet (elatum) is a Latin word meaning \\"exalted\\", \\"high\\" or \\"lofty\\". Distribution and habitat The tall leek orchid is common and widespread in every Australian state. In New South Wales it grows in coastal heath, scrub and forest and inland in sandy mallee to heath or rock outcrops. In Western Australia it grows in sand, gravel and laterite in winter-wet depressions. In Victoria it is found in moist to well drained soil in heathy woodlands and open forest, in full sun or semi shade where it flowers better after fire.

People of different ages and gender tend to differ in many aspects, such as legal and social responsibilities, outlooks on life, and self-perceptions. Young people tend to have fewer legal privileges (if they are below the age of majority), they are more likely to push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new technologies, and to need education. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people are also more likely to vote, and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence. In different societies, age may be viewed or treated differently. For example, age may be measured starting from conception or from birth, and starting at either age zero or age one. Transitions such as reaching puberty, age of majority, or retirement are often socially significant. The concepts of successful aging and healthy aging refer to both social and physical aspects of the aging process.  Cultural variations  An elderly woman Arbitrary divisions set to mark periods of life may include: juvenile (via infancy, childhood, preadolescence, adolescence), early adulthood, middle adulthood, and late adulthood. More casual terms may include \\"teenagers,\\" \\"tweens,\\" \\"twentysomething\\", \\"thirtysomething\\", etc. as well as \\"vicenarian\\", \\"tricenarian\\", \\"quadragenarian\\", etc. The age of an adult human is commonly measured in whole years since the day of birth. Fractional years, months or even weeks may be used to describe the age of children and infants for finer resolution. The time of day the birth occurred is not commonly considered. In some cultures there are other ways to express age. For example, some cultures measure age by counting years including the current year, while others count years without including it. It could be said for the same person that he is twenty years old or that he is in the twenty-first year of his life. In Russian the former expression is generally used, the latter one has restricted usage: it is used for age of a deceased person in obituaries and for the age of an adult when it is desired to show him/her older than he/she is. (Psychologically, a woman in her 20th year seems older than one who is 19 years old.) Other cultures that express age differently may not use years elapsed since birth at all. Inuit culture is an example in which birthdays are not celebrated because maturity is not signified in terms of years. The Navajo culture is another in which age is not counted through years elapsed from birth. In this case, age is measured through certain milestones in a person's life, such as the first time they laugh. In cultures where age is not measured by years since birth, most individuals do not know how old they are in years. People in these cultures may find more importance in other aspects of their birth, such as the season, agricultural practices, or spiritual connections taking place when they were born. A culture may also choose to place a greater emphasis on family lineage than age, as is done in Mayan society. A Mayan adult would not determine a child's responsibility and status in terms of age by years, but instead by relative seniority to others in the family or community. The main purpose of counting age in terms of years from birth is for the convenience of grouping individuals by age, as is needed in industrialized society. The medical practices and compulsory schooling that resulted from industrialization factored largely into the need for counting age in terms of years since birth. Even in Westernized societies such as the United States, age in terms of years since birth did not begin until the mid-1800s. Depending on cultural and personal philosophy, ageing can be seen as an undesirable phenomenon, reducing beauty and bringing one closer to death; or as an accumulation of wisdom, mark of survival and a status worthy of respect. In some cases numerical age is important (whether good or bad), whereas others find the stage in life that one has reached (adulthood, independence, marriage, retirement, career success) to be more important. East Asian age reckoning is different from that found in Western culture. Traditional Chinese culture uses a different ageing method, called Xusui (ËôõÊ≠≤) with respect to common ageing which is called Zhousui (Âë®Ê≠≤). According to Luo Zhufeng (1991), the Xusui method, people are born at age 1, not age 0, possibly because conception is already considered to be the start of the life span and possibly because the number '0' was not historically present in Ancient China, and another difference is the ageing day: Xusui grows up at the Spring Festival (aka. Chinese New Year's Day), while Zhousui grows up at one's birthday.Theobald, U. (2010). Sui Ê≠≤, the traditional lunar age. In ChinaKnowledge.de: A Encyclopaedia on Chinese History, Literature and Art. Retrieved from http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Terms/sui.html In parts of Tibet, age is counted from conception i.e. one is usually 9 months old when one is born. Age in prenatal development is normally measured in gestational age, taking the last menstruation of the mother as a point of beginning. Alternatively, fertilisation age, beginning from fertilisation can be taken. Legal Most legal systems define a specific age for when an individual is allowed or obliged to do particular activities. These age specifications include voting age, drinking age, age of consent, age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, marriageable age, age of candidacy, and mandatory retirement age. Admission to a movie for instance, may depend on age according to a motion picture rating system. A bus fare might be discounted for the young or old. Each nation, government and non-government organisation has different ways of classifying age. Similarly, in many countries in jurisprudence, the defence of infancy is a form of defence by which a defendant argues that, at the time a law was broken, they were not liable for their actions and thus should not be held liable for a crime. Many courts recognise that defendants who are considered to be juveniles may avoid criminal prosecution on account of their age and in borderline cases the age of the offender is often held to be a mitigating circumstance. Political Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people are also more likely to vote, and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence. Education tends to lose political significance for people as they age.  Coping and well-being  Elderly Gambian woman. Psychologists have examined coping skills in the elderly. Various factors, such as social support, religion and spirituality, active engagement with life and having an internal locus of control have been proposed as being beneficial in helping people to cope with stressful life events in later life. Social support and personal control are possibly the two most important factors that predict well-being, morbidity and mortality in adults. Other factors that may link to well-being and quality of life in the elderly include social relationships (possibly relationships with pets as well as humans), and health. Retirement, a common transition faced by the elderly, may have both positive and negative consequences. Individuals in different wings in the same retirement home have demonstrated a lower risk of mortality and higher alertness and self-rated health in the wing where residents had greater control over their environment, though personal control may have less impact on specific measures of health. Social control, perceptions of how much influence one has over one's social relationships, shows support as a moderator variable for the relationship between social support and perceived health in the elderly and may positively influence coping in the elderly. = Religion = Religion is an important factor used by the elderly in coping with the demands of later life and appears more often than other forms of coping later in life. Religiosity is a multidimensional variable; while participation in religious activities in the sense of participation in formal and organised rituals may decline, it may become a more informal, but still important aspect of life such as through personal or private prayer. = Self- rated health = Positive self-perception of health has been correlated with higher well-being and reduced mortality in the elderly. Various reasons have been proposed for this association; people who are objectively healthy may naturally rate their health better than that of their ill counterparts, though this link has been observed even in studies which have controlled for socioeconomic status, psychological functioning and health status. This finding is generally stronger for men than women, though the pattern between genders is not universal across all studies and some results suggest sex-based differences only appear in certain age groups, for certain causes of mortality and within a specific sub-set of self-ratings of health. =Paradox of ageing= Seniors‚Äô subjective health remains relatively stable while objective health worsens with age. Furthermore, it seems that the perceived health improves with age when objective health is controlled in the equation. This phenomenon is known as the paradox of ageing. People's expectations concerning health co-evolve with the health norms surrounding one's age. Elderly people often associate their functional and physical decline with the normal ageing process. The elderly may actually enhance their perception of their own health through social comparison; for instance, the older people get, the more they may consider themselves in better health than their same-aged peers. Hence, the older a person becomes and the more their actual health declines, the greater the potential role is for social comparison processes to create a gap between a person's objective and subjective health. = Healthcare = Many societies in Western Europe and Japan have ageing populations. While the effects on society are complex, there is a concern about the impact on health care demand. The large number of suggestions in the literature for specific interventions to cope with the expected increase in demand for long-term care in ageing societies can be organised under four headings: improve system performance; redesign service delivery; support informal caregivers; and shift demographic parameters. However, the annual growth in national health spending is not mainly due to increasing demand from ageing populations, but rather has been driven by rising incomes, costly new medical technology, a shortage of health care workers and informational asymmetries between providers and patients. A number of health problems become more prevalent as people get older. These include mental health problems as well as physical health problems, especially dementia. Even so, it has been estimated that population ageing only explains 0.2 percentage points of the annual growth rate in medical spending of 4.3 percent since 1970. In addition, certain reforms to the Medicare system in the United States decreased elderly spending on home health care by 12.5 percent per year between 1996 and 2000. This would suggest that the impact of ageing populations on health care costs is not inevitable. In United States prisons, medical costs for an ageing inmate could be above $100 per day as of July 2007, while typical inmates cost $33 per day. Most State DOCs report spending more than 10 percent of the annual budget on elderly care. That is expected to rise over the next 10‚Äì20 years. Some states have talked about releasing ageing inmates early.  Successful ageing  Two men practising Tahtib. One of them is balding, suggesting vigorous activity at an advanced age. The concept of successful ageing can be traced back to the 1950s and was popularised in the 1980s. Previous research into ageing exaggerated the extent to which health disabilities, such as diabetes or osteoporosis, could be attributed exclusively to age and research in gerontology exaggerated the homogeneity of samples of elderly people. Other research shows that even late in life, potential exists for physical, mental, and social growth and development. Successful ageing consists of three components: # Low probability of disease or disability; # High cognitive and physical function capacity; # Active engagement with life. A greater number of people self-report successful ageing than those that strictly meet these criteria. Successful ageing may be viewed an interdisciplinary concept, spanning both psychology and sociology, where it is seen as the transaction between society and individuals across the life span with specific focus on the later years of life. The terms \\"healthy ageing\\" and \\"optimal ageing\\" have been proposed as alternatives to successful ageing, partly because the term \\"successful ageing\\" has been criticised for making healthy ageing sound too competitive. Six suggested dimensions of successful ageing include: # No physical disability over the age of 75 as rated by a physician; # Good subjective health assessment (i.e. good self-ratings of one's health); # Length of undisabled life; # Good mental health; # Objective social support; # Self-rated life satisfaction in eight domains, namely marriage, income-related work, children, friendship and social contacts, hobbies, community service activities, religion and recreation/sports. Numerous worldwide health, ageing and retirement surveys contain questions pertaining to pensions. The Meta Data Repository ‚Äì created by the non-profit RAND Corporation and sponsored by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health ‚Äì provides access to meta data for these questions as well as links to obtain respondent data from the originating surveys.  Ageing and communication  Display of healthy communication between the elderly Healthy ageing implies optimal well- being in spite of barriers resulting from age.Worrall, L.,& Hickson, L. M. (2003). Theoretical foundations of communication disability in aging. In Linda E. Worrall & Louise M. Hickson(Eds.). Communication disability in aging: from prevention to intervention (pp. 32-33). Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2003 The global population is ageing and will continue to have communication inabilities unless barriers of communication with the elderly are more highly promoted.Worrall, L.,& Hickson, L. M. (2003). Implications for theory, practice, and policy. In Linda E. Worrall & Louise M. Hickson (Eds.). Communication disability in aging: from prevention to intervention (pp. 297-298). Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2003 Sensory impairments include hearing and vision deficits, which can cause communication barriers. Changes in cognition, hearing, and vision are easily associated with healthy ageing and can cause problems when diagnosing dementia and aphasia due to the similarities. =Hearing loss= Hearing aid Hearing loss is a common condition among ageing adults. Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are high blood pressure, diabetes or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear.Worrall, L.,& Hickson, L. M. (2003). Communication activity limitations. In Linda E. Worrall & Louise M. Hickson(Eds.). Communication disability in aging: from prevention to intervention (pp. 141-142). Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2003 Hearing aids are commonly referred to as personal amplifying systems, which can generally improve hearing by about 50%.Nussbaum, J. F., Thompson, T. L., & Robinson, J. D. (1989). Barriers to conversation. In Jon F. Nussbaum, Teresa Thompson, James D. Robinson (Eds.). Communication and aging (234-253).New York: Harper & Row,1989 Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age related social and/or physical problems.Bayles, K., Kaszniak, A., & Tomoeda, C. (1987). Linguistic communication and normal aging. In communication and cognition in normal aging and dementia (pp. 150-152). Boston: Little, Brown and Company. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems are more important than changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis is an example of a hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear.Touhy, T. A., Jett, K., Ebersole, P., & Hess, P. A. (2012). Communicating with older adults. In Theris A. Touhy & Kathleen (Eds.). Jett Ebersole & Hess' toward healthy aging: human needs & nursing response (96-98).St. Louis, Mo.: Elsevier/Mosby, 2012 This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation. =Visual impairment= The interpretation of facial expressions and mouthing can be difficult to understand when an individual has a visual impairment. Such problems hinder the ability of people to understand stimuli and translate information pertaining to perception with their brain for analysis. Non-verbal communication is important in effective communication and elders with vision loss are more likely to misinterpret or read the other person's actions in a wrong way. Visual impairments also cause a loss in positive perceptions of the environment around them. This can lead to isolation and possible depression in elderly people. Macular degeneration is a common cause of vision loss in elderly people. It diminishes the macula of the eye, which is responsible for clear vision. It causes progressive loss of central vision and possible loss of colour vision. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and growth of abnormal vessels around the retina causing the photoreceptors not to receive proper images. Though ageing almost always causes this, other possible effects and risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history and excessive sunlight exposure. = Digital world = In a world increasingly relying on digital technologies, older adults face higher risks of social exclusion and prejudices (see digital ageism). Generational segregation naturalizes youth as digitally adept and the old as digitally inept. Older adults‚Äô experiences are often excluded from research agendas on digital media.Loos, E. F., L. Haddon & E. Mante-Meijer (2012), Generational use of new media. Farnham: Ashgate.Sawchuk, K., & Crow, B. (2010). Into the grey zone: Seniors, cell phones and milieus that matter. In B. Poppinga (ed.), Observing the mobile user experience: Proceedings of the 1st international workshop held in conjunction with NordiCHI (pp. 17‚Äì20). Oldenburg, Germany: HaptiMap.  Political struggle against ageing  Though many sex for men state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping ageing are achievable, there are still no international or national programmes focused on stopping ageing or on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. In 2012 the Longevity political parties started in Russia, then in the USA, Israel and the Netherlands. These parties aim to provide political support to anti-ageing and radical life extension research and technologies and want to ensure the fastest possible and at the same time the softest societal transition to the next step: radical life extension and life without ageing, that will make it possible to provide the access to such technologies to the most of the currently living people.  Social science of ageing  An elderly Iraqi man. Seniors at a San Francisco Day Care Center in Chinatown, late 1970s. *Disengagement theory is the idea that separation of older people from active roles in society is normal and appropriate, and benefits both society and older individuals. Disengagement theory, first proposed by Cumming and Henry, has received considerable attention in gerontology, but has been much criticised. The original data on which Cumming and Henry based the theory were from a rather small sample of older adults in Kansas City and from this select sample Cumming and Henry then took disengagement to be a universal theory. There are research data suggesting that the elderly who do become detached from society are those who were initially reclusive individuals and such disengagement is not purely a response to ageing. *Activity theory, in contrast to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, the more likely they are to be satisfied with life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well- being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as activity theory. However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood. *Selectivity theory mediates between the activity and disengagement theories, and suggests that it may benefit older people to become more active in some aspects of their lives, more disengaged in others. *Continuity theory is the view that in ageing people are inclined to maintain, as much as they can, the same habits, personalities and styles of life that they have developed in earlier years. Continuity theory is Atchley's theory that individuals, in later life, make adaptations to enable them to gain a sense of continuity between the past and the present and the theory implies that this sense of continuity helps to contribute to well-being in later life. Disengagement theory, activity theory and continuity theory are social theories about ageing, though all may be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory. =Other definitions= As cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging and for instance a bio-techno-social definition of aging has been suggested.

Established in 1848, it was one of the first coeducational institutions in the South, and one of the first state-chartered schools in southern Middle Tennessee. Operating under the auspices of the Churches of Christ, the school offered a classical curriculum, and stressed adherence to a strict moral and religious code. While the school thrived under the leadership of presidents such as William Davis Carnes (1850-1858, 1872-1878) and William Newton Billingsley (1890-1911), it struggled to compete for students after the establishment of state colleges and public high schools in the early 20th century. It closed in 1939.Tara Mitchell Mielnik, \\"Burritt College,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Retrieved: 2 March 2015. History The idea for a school in Spencer was first proposed by Nathan Trogdon, a brick mason who had built the second Van Buren County Courthouse in the town. By the late 1840s, a 12-member board of trustees had been formed with Charles Gillentine as president. In 1848, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a law chartering the institution, which was named in honor of activist Elihu Burritt.Effie Gillentine-Ramsey, Burritt College: Our Alma Mater (McQuiddy Books, 1914). Funds for the school were raised from among the residents of White, Warren, and Van Buren counties. When classes began on February 26, 1849, the college had an enrollment of 73 students and employed three teachers. The first president of the college, Isaac Newton Jones, was a graduate of Irving College in nearby McMinnville. He established the college's curriculum, but left after only one year.Francis Marion West, ‚Äò‚ÄôPioneer of the Cumberlands: A History of Burritt College‚Äô‚Äô (master‚Äôs thesis, Tennessee Technological University, 1969). Accessed at ‚Äò‚ÄôRestoration History‚Äô‚Äô website, 4 March 2015. His successor, William Davis Carnes, played a critical role in shaping the college's policies, most notably introducing coeducation in 1850 and instituting a strict moral and religious code. The policy allowing coeducation met staunch opposition at first, but Carnes defended it, stating, \\"It is God's law that the young of the opposite sexes should exert a healthful influence in the formation of each other's characters, and no place is better suited to this purpose than the classroom and lecture room.\\" To alleviate fears, Carnes modified the school's code to bar all communication between the sexes outside classrooms or other supervised events. Carnes' moral code barred swearing, gambling, smoking and drinking. He struggled to curtail drinking, however, in spite of introducing increasingly stringent measures, including the expulsion of anyone caught in possession of alcoholic beverages. He finally turned to local law enforcement, pleading with them to hunt down moonshiners operating in the Spencer area, and destroy their stills. In an apparent act of retaliation, the president's house and the girls' dormitory were burned in 1857. Disgusted, Carnes resigned to become president at East Tennessee University (the modern University of Tennessee). He was succeeded by John Powell, who had been president of the Central Female Institute in McMinnville. The college closed at the outset of the Civil War in 1861 as many of its male students left to fight in the Confederate army. The college's relative isolation protected it during the first half of the war, though it was eventually occupied by Union troops. With the help of Carnes, who had returned to the area to escape the horrors of the war, the school briefly reopened in 1864. It was forced to close by the Union Army, however, due to concerns over Confederate guerrilla activity in the area. The Union Army occupants used the main hall as a barracks, and dormitories were converted into stables. The campus grounds were trampled and damaged, and the buildings were left in a state of ruin. At the end of the war, the college's trustees sold part of its campus to raise funds for repairs. With Carnes' help, the school managed to reopen shortly after the close of the war. Martin White, a Burritt graduate remembered by students for having walked the entire distance from his home in North Carolina to Spencer to enroll at the school, was hired as president. Carnes was rehired as president in 1872. During the 1870s, Thomas Wesley Brents, a physician who had recently relocated to Spencer, offered his assistance to Burritt, and began raising money for the college. With his help, the campus more than doubled in size, and a new administration building was constructed. However, Brents demanded he be made president. This angered Carnes, who resigned in 1878, allowing Brents to take over. During his four-year tenure, Brents increased the college's enrollment and overhauled its curriculum. By the time he had resigned in 1882, however, enrollment had started to decline. In subsequent years, the school struggled financially, and was finally forced to close in 1889. The Board of Trustees considered selling the college's campus, but ultimately decided to reopen the school. In hopes of reviving the college, the Board hired a Burritt graduate, William Newton Billingsley, as president. Billingsley stabilized the college's finances, and managed to increase enrollment to over two hundred students by the end of the decade. In 1897, the college reported an annual income of $25,000, 164 students, 10 teachers, and three thousand books.Edwin Emerson, Jr. (ed.), The College Year-Book and Athletic Record for the Academic Year 1896-97 (Stone and Kimball, 1897), p. 46. The early 1900s were among the most prosperous in the school's history, as enrollment never dipped below 200 during this period. On March 5, 1906, the college's main building was destroyed by fire. At a meeting the following day, the college's administrators and students agreed to finish the year and make plans to rebuild. Classes were held at the campus church and in private residences until the end of the term. The college was closed for several months while a new building was constructed. In spite of fundraising struggles, the new building was completed in 1907. Burritt again suffered with enrollment issues following the departure of Billingsley in 1911, due in part to the opening of two state normal schools in the region: Middle Tennessee State in Murfreesboro and Tennessee Polytechnic Institute (modern Tennessee Tech) in Cookeville. The Board struggled to find a permanent president until the hiring of Henry Eugene Scott in 1918. During the 1920s, Scott overhauled the curriculum to bring it more in line with that of a typical preparatory school and junior college, offering courses in agriculture, typing, bookkeeping, and teacher training, as well as high school courses. By the 1930s, Burritt had become dependent on the Van Buren County school board for much of its funding. When the school board decided to build a county high school in 1936, Burritt was no longer able to compete for students. It finally closed in 1939. =List of presidents= *Isaac Newton Jones, 1849-1850 *William Davis Carnes, 1850-1858 *John Powell, 1858-1861 *Martin White, 1867-1870 *John Powell, 1870-1872 *William Davis Carnes, 1872-1878 *Thomas Wesley Brents, 1878-82 *Aaron Tillman Seitz, 1882-1886 *A.G.

The college held session for two 21-week terms (Fall and Spring) per year. Students were required take at least three, but no more than four, classes per term. Students who completed the curriculum were awarded with a Bachelor of Arts or a Master of Arts. During its early decades the college was divided into two departments: the \\"academical\\" and the \\"collegiate.\\" Students in the academical department were required to take Latin, mathematics, geography, spelling, writing and history during their first year, with Greek and English composition added in the second. Students in the collegiate department were to take courses in Latin, Greek and mathematics during the first three years, and chemistry, geology, political and moral philosophy, astronomy, \\"evidences of Christianity,\\" and criticism during their senior year. Electives included French, German, drawing and painting, music, and needlework and embroidery. Anatomy, physiology, botany, and gymnastics were added to the curriculum during the Brents administration. Bible classes were added to the curriculum in the 1910s. By the 1920s, the curriculum focused on more practical trades such as teacher training, bookkeeping, typing, and agriculture. A typical day during the Carnes and Powell administrations began at 5 A.M., with students initially preparing their rooms for inspection. This was followed by a one- hour study period and a half-hour devotional in the main hall. Classes and recitations were held throughout the remainder of the day, which ended with another half-hour devotional. Students were required to engage in private study for two hours during the evening. Daily chapel attendance was initially mandatory, but this was no longer the case by the 1890s. Students were also required to engage in 30 minutes of calisthenics per day. Extracurricular activities initially focused on the college's two literary societies: the Philomathesian, founded in 1851, and the Calliopean, founded in 1878. Both societies possessed thousand-volume libraries, and engaged in weekly debates. Athletic programs were eventually added. By the 1920s, Burritt was competing with other regional schools and clubs in baseball, basketball, football, and tennis. The program included women's teams in basketball and tennis. Location Burritt College entrance gate It was located in primarily rural area, and at first an unincorporated area. The town of Spencer wasn't incorporated until 1909. The town lacked railroad access for most of Burritt's history. A catalog for the college from the early 1900s notes that the nearest railroad station was at Doyle, roughly to the north. The campus's location atop the rugged western Cumberland Plateau affected its culture. A walking trail connected the campus to a cliff at the edge of the Plateau known as \\"Lover's Leap.\\" Burritt students occasionally took hiking trips to nearby Fall Creek Falls, which they simply called \\"Big Falls.\\" The Burritt campus covered around 10 acres at the end of the Civil War, but had expanded to 25 acres by the 1880s. It initially included an administration building, dormitories for men and women, a chapel, and a presidential house. In 1878, the college constructed a new three-story, seventeen-room administration building that featured an by recitation hall. After this building burned in 1906, it was replaced by a building of similar size (three stories and eighteen rooms), but lacking exterior adornments. In the 1920s, the college added a two-story, 36-room building known as \\"Billingsley Hall,\\" a gymnasium, and a new presidential house. Burritt's rustic stone entrance gate, which contains the college's name and charter date (1848), still stands facing College Street (TN-30) in Spencer. The old administration building is also still standing. The Burritt Alumni Museum and the Burritt Memorial Library, both of which are open to the public, are now located on the former Burritt campus.

The trip to Europe landed her in Paris's infamous Shakespeare and Co., where she lived for months in between touring in squats and cafes throughout Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Germany and Belgium. She was awarded a space and began working with members of Kilmoter Zero, writing a short play for their 24-hour play series. During this time, Chap published 5 chapbooks of poetry, 1 chapbook of short stories and a one-act play, entitled ‚ÄòSecurity‚Äô, which was given a reading at Shakespeare and Co.‚Äôs first literary festival. Chap returned to Chicago to compete as a storm poet in the National Poetry Slam. = Cliterature = After performing in the Bay Area‚Äôs 2004 Ladyfest, curated by Tina Butcher (Madison Young), Chap was fascinated by the way in which artists in feminist communities supported each other. As a way of documenting how feminist writers work within communities, she began interviewing fellow participants in the Bay Area‚Äôs Ladyfest. Every author in the line-up curated by Young (besides Diane DiPrima) was interviewed and featured in a book length zine entitled Cliterature: 18 interviews with women writers‚Äô, which was later featured in the International Museum of Women. = Live Through This = Chap's second collection was the book, Live Through This: On Creativity and Self-Destruction (Seven Stories Press).Live Through This, Seven Stories Press, In a collection of original stories, essays, artwork, and photography, Nan Goldin, Eileen Myles, bell hooks, and other cutting-edge artists explore their use of art to survive madness, abuse, incest, depression, and the impulse toward self-destruction manifest in eating disorders, cutting, addiction, and contemplation of suicide. The book confronts the brutality many women and girls encounter in the world around them, and takes as its subject the often misunderstood violence they at times inflict upon themselves. The collection was nominated for a 2010 Lambda Literary Award for best anthology and was given rave reviews, primarily by the feminist press.Antonio Gonzalez Cerna (February 18, 2010), Lambda Literary Award in Anthology.

Second Edition  Seven Stories released a second edition of the book in 2012 which included the original essays, and additional material. A new introduction was written by Amanda Palmer and two new essays were added by Margaret Cho and Swoon. Also added to this edition was an artist resource list that included a glossary of additional artists to look to for inspiration and an updated mental health resource list.  Mental Health Advocacy  Chap has lectured and presented widely on the book nationally and abroad, including at the Brooklyn Museum, New York University, the Art Institute of Chicago and featuring on KEXP. She continues to tour speaking on the conversion of art and self- destruction and is currently represented by Soapbox, the non-profit feminist organization started by Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards.  Theatre  In the introduction to Live Through This, Chap comments on how hearing of playwright Sarah Kane‚Äôs death affected with her. ‚ÄúI was in rehearsals for one of my own plays when I heard of her death. I don‚Äôt remember exactly where I was at the time‚Äîprobably in the theatre, making last minute additions to the text. What I do remember was the shift in me, the space slightly to the left of my heart that hurt when I heard it was suicide.‚Äù Kane's death was a great inspiration for Chap's future mental health advocacy. This advocacy is evident in Chap's first full-length play, entitled perhaps merely quiet. Set inside a mental hospital, the play that focuses on the question of sanity, and how it is viewed differently by both the patients and the doctors. The play was later giving a reading by the UK based theatrical troupe, the Icarus Theatre Collective. Other mounted plays include The Insatiable Lite Duet (Curious Theatre Branch, Chicago) and Security (Brooklyn Playwrights Collective, NY).

Across the piazza from the church is the Palazzo Tolomei, one of the oldest buildings in the city. The Tolomei for many years were associated with the church.A Medieval Italian Commune: Siena Under the Nine, 1287-1355, by William M. Bowsky, page 276. Facade History The original Romanesque style church with a Latin Cross layout was initially constructed in the 11th to 12th-century. Traces of Romanesque columns remain in the adjacent small cloister. During the 13th century, the cloister would host the council of the nascent Republic of Siena. It is claimed that at this site in 1260, a meeting took place between the Council of 24 and Florentine ambassadors. The latters demanded that Siena breach its walls, and allow Florentine fortresses in each Terzo. These heavy demands forced the former to decide that war with Florence was inevitable, and they dismissed the ambassadors, and prepared for war. They acknowledged the need to hire German mercenaries from Count Giordano d'Anglano, vicar of King Manfred, but lacked the funds. Upon hearing this, Salimbene Salimbeni, banker and founder of an early branch of the future Monte dei Paschi, merely walked to his nearby home, and returned to this cloister with the wheelbarrow full of 118,000 florins. The mercenaries proved essential to the Sienese victory at the Battle of Montaperti.City and Spectacle in Medieval Europe, edited by Barbara Hanawalt, Kathryn Reyerson, page 99-102. Also at this church, it is said that in 1376, Saint Catherine of Siena was able to force a reconciliation of a bitter feud between the Maconi and Tolomei/Rimaldini families. With the feuding parties present, she entered into a trance like extasis while in prayer at an altar. The church underwent a number of modifications, most prominently after the earthquake of 1798. In 1800, a brick Neoclassical temple facade was added with four columns and tympanum, designed by Tommaso and Francesco Paccagnini. The niches flanking the entrance hold statues (1802) of Saint Bernardo Tolomei and the Blessed Nera Tolomei, works by Giuseppe Silini. The church has a Madonna and child with St Luke and Romuald (circa 1508) by Girolamo del Pacchia, a fresco of the Piet√† and the instruments of the Passion by Martino di Bartolomeo, and a marble sculptural group depicting the Glory of St Christopher (1693) by Giovanni Antonio Mazzuoli. Glory of St Christopher It now houses a Madonna and child by the 15th-century school of Della Robbia, a St George and the Dragon and a St Christopher attributed to either the Master of the Osservanza Triptych felt to be the same person as Sano di Pietro; and a tondo of the Madonna and child by the Master of San Pietro a Ovile.

It was designed by John Hall & Son and built from 1887 to 1888 by Abraham James. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 November 1993.  History  Dunmore Arms Hotel, the earlier hotel on the site of the Treasury Hotel, corner of George and Elizabeth Streets, 1886 Illustration of the Treasury Hotel, circa 1889 The Treasury Hotel was built in 1887-88, replacing an earlier hotel, the Dunmore Arms (1865). In 1885 James Hunter took a 25-year lease from William Cribb on several adjoining allotments on the corner of George and Elizabeth Streets from William Cribb. Hunter planned a major commercial development on the site, and in 1886 erected office buildings with Treasury Chambers fronting George St and Francis House on Elizabeth Street (Hunters Buildings). The choice of location was astute, for the new Treasury Building opposite was being erected and enhanced the prestige of the area. Financial problems prevented Hunter from completing the project and in 1887 he sub-let the Dunmore Arms site to well-known Brisbane publican, Denis O'Connor. O'Connor engaged architects John Hall & Son to design a new hotel for the site. The contractor was Abraham James and the contract sum ¬£3,999. Borrowing its name from the partially finished new government offices opposite, the hotel offered \\"tastefully furnished and decorated\\" accommodation to \\"Families and Commercial Gentlemen\\". In May 1889 O'Connor transferred his sub-lease to George Back Cutbush who remained the lessee until 1910. In 1906 William Cribb donated both allotments 18 & 19 to the YMCA in return for an annuity of ¬£400. Treasury Hotel, 1906 Over the next few years the YMCA sold most of this property and the new owner of the Treasury Hotel in 1908 was William Denis O'Connor. The hotel remained linked with the O'Connor family till the late 1950s. During the late 1880s the Treasury Hotel was one of a large number of hotels in the city. In 1889 there were 9 hotels in George Street. The Treasury Hotel and the Transcontinental Hotel are the only George Street buildings from this period that remain in use as hotels. In 2015, the hotel is trading under the name \\"Irish Murphy's\\".  Description  The Treasury Hotel, located on the corner of George and Elizabeth Streets, is a three storey building with basement. It contains classical detailing, as do other nearby prominent buildings including the Treasury Building) and Treasury Chambers (Hunters Buildings). Typical of many hotels, it is located on a corner site and has a truncated corner that originally contained the entry. The hotel was originally L-shaped and an arched carriageway in George Street gave access to the rear of the building. This rear courtyard has been built in and is now part of the hotel. On the main facades, there is a decorative string course above the first floor verandah roof. The windows on the second floor have moulded bracketed sills and decorative pediments. Above this are regularly spaced paired brackets supporting a cornice, surmounted by a parapet. Pedestals carrying urns divide the parapet into sections, some of which contain balustrading, while others are solid with the title \\"TREASURY HOTEL\\" in raised lettering. On the centre of the parapet of the Elizabeth Street facade is a pediment. A similar pediment crowns the corner and has a flagpole located behind it. The ground floor below a street awning has been modified and covered in modern brickwork. The upper two storeys retain much of the original detail, but some of this is obscured by modern sun hoods and an altered first-floor verandah which has raked posts. Some herring-bone strutting is situated between the joists of the structure spanning the laneway off George Street beside the building. Internally, none of the original detailing remains as a result of the building being thoroughly renovated in the late 1970s.

Stroud, Gloucestershire, England, 11 October 1921 ‚Äì d. Porter County, Indiana 30 October 1999) was a geographer who came to specialize in the historical geography of Southeast Asia and East Asia. He was Professor of Geography and History, University of California at Berkeley 1958‚Äì1966; Professor of Geography, University College London 1966‚Äì1971; Professor of Geography and History, University of Chicago 1971‚Äì1977, where he was Irving B. Harris Professor and Chairman of the Committee on Social Thought 1977‚Äì1991 (Emeritus). He married Margaret Ashworth in 1957, and the couple had two sons, Julian and Jonathan. Honors and awards He was awarded the Citation for Meritorious Contributions to the Field of Geography for \\"two decades of productive enquiry\\" by The Association of American Geographers in 1974. He was president of the Association for Asian Studies in 1976, and fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1976) and of the British Academy (1986). He received an honorary LL.D. from University College London in 1975. Education and career After serving as navigator in the Bomber Command and the Pathfinder Group 205 in World War II, Wheatley took a degree in geography at Liverpool University, at first specializing in English historical geography. When he moved to University College, London, he became interested in the historical geography of Southeast Asia and China, then moved to University of Malaya, in Malaysia, then University of California, Berkeley, returned for a time to University College, and finally to University of Chicago, where he stayed from 1971 until retiring in 1991. Scholarly interests and contributions Wheatley's obituary says of him that he was a \\"man of ideas, of exacting standards and often of forceful expression. He was the first British geographer to explore sources in Chinese and Arabic as well as in English for the historical geography of South-East Asia and the Arab world. Only the grand thesis was good enough for him.\\" Another memorialist wrote, \\"Scholars who study the relationship between place and power have drawn on his city as cosmomagical center for religious, ritual, and political activities. The cohesive force of Wheatley's pivotal 'si fang zhi ji' (The Pivot of the Four Quarters) can be felt today not only in Shang studies but in the analysis of Aztec cities.\\" Major works    References   * Notes  External links  * Paul Wheatley, WorldCat authority page.

Facade of Palazzo Tolomei History The building is one of the oldest palaces in the city and was erected between 1270 and 1275 by the Tolomei family. It served as the first permanent headquarters of the Sienese commune during the early years of the Guelph era, before the construction of the Palazzo Pubblico in the Piazza del Campo, and it also functioned as a bank and private residence.[Max Grossman, ¬´A Case of Double Identity: the Public and Private Faces of the Palazzo Tolomei in Siena¬ª, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, 72, no 1, March 2013, pp. 48-77. It stands on the west side of the Piazza Tolomei, across from the church of San Cristoforo. The aristocratic Tolomei family for many years was associated with this parish church.A Medieval Italian Commune: Siena Under the Nine, 1287-1355, by William M. Bowsky, page 276. On the Via Banchi di Sopra, it is a few houses south and across the street of the Palazzo Bichi Ruspoli, a few blocks north of the Piazza del Campo. The original palace of this Guelf aristocratic family was mostly destroyed by Ghibelline mobs in 1267 but was rebuilt in its current form shortly after the new Guelph regime came to power. The stone palace, with its tall first floor, mullioned windows with trefoil decoration in upper floors, was restored in the 1960s and is now home to Banca CR Firenze. Among the most notable members of the Tolomei family was Pia Tolomei, who lived in the thirteenth century. In 1295, however, she was supposedly murdered by her Guelph husband from the Maremma, who wished to remarry. Her story was popular in the 19th century as a symbol of faithfulness to principles in the face of treachery and self-interest. Gaetano Donizetti made her the subject of his tragic opera, Pia de' Tolomei. She was initially immortalized by Dante, who encounters her in Purgatory:Commune of Siena, entry. Plaque on palace wall > :Ricorditi di me, che son la Pia: :Siena mi fe', disfecemi Maremma: :Salsi > colui che innanellata pria, :Disposato m'avea con la sua gemma.'' :Remember > me, who is the Pia; :Siena was my faith, but defaced by Maremma: :He who had > engaged with his ring me first, :Disposed of me from his jewel. The Tolomei family also bore Saint Bernardo Tolomei and the Blessed Nera Tolomei, memorialized in the facade of the church of San Cristoforo. In front of the palace stands a column crowned with a Roman She-wolf.

Pictured is a common raccoon and a striped skunk eating cat food in an urban area. A mesopredator is a mid- ranking predator in the middle of a trophic level, which typically preys on smaller animals. Mesopredators often vary in ecosystems depending on the food web. There is no specific size or weight restrictions to qualify as a mesopredator, as it depends on how large the apex predator is, and what the mesopredator's prey is. When new species are introduced into an ecosystem, the role of mesopredator often changes; the same happens if a species is removed.  The Mesopredator Release Effect When populations of apex predators decrease, populations of mesopredators often increase. This is the mesopredator release effect. \\"Mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations, sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions\\". When apex predators are removed from the ecosystem, this gives the mesopredators less competition and conflict. They are able to catch more prey and have lower mortality rates. Often, mesopredators can take over the role of apex predators. This happens when new species are introduced into an ecosystem or when species leave or are killed off. When this happens, and the new apex predator or former mesopredator, becomes the new species on top of the food chain, it is important to remember that they are not ecologically identical to the former apex predator, and is likely a smaller species, which will have different effects on the structure and stability of the ecosystem. The mesopredators that become the new apex predators are the species that benefit from this mesopredator release. Apex predators reduce mesopredator populations, and change mesopredator behaviors and habitat choices, by preying on and intimidating mesopredators. This can occur in any ecosystem with any type of relationship between predator and prey. However, in the case of the relationship between apex predator and mesopredator, it could mean that the apex predator causes the mesopredator to leave the ecosystem, again, creating room for a new species to become mesopredator. Mesopredator outbreaks are increasing in fragmented habitats. A main cause is the disappearance of apex species within the habitat. Apex species are usually larger animals who require a bigger area and will often leave if the habitat is lost. When the apex predator leaves the ecosystem, a former mesopredator will become the new apex predator. Likewise, the apex predators, being larger animals, will often have more encounters with humans, leaving them more susceptible to harmful conflicts. These harmful conflicts can either cause the apex predator to leave the ecosystem in fear of danger, or if the situation is extreme enough, the humans will have killed off the apex predator. Another reason why mesopredator outbreaks are becoming more popular is because of certain resources being added in fragmented areas. Resources such as pet food, trash, crop, and crop pests. These resources often appear when development is occurring on land near the ecosystem. This scenario is the most ideal for mesopredator outbreaks to occur.

Armenian archeology  Armenia is among sites of earliest life. Evidence of prehistoric humankind have been found in caves and open air settlements here. Tools made from flint, obsidian, basalt and other materials from the Stone Age (1 million 40,000 years ago) indicate that Neanderthal Man made his home in present-day Armenia. With those tools, he carved the story of his life onto petroglyphs (stone carvings) which can still be found in regions of Armenia and date to the Mesolithic Era, millions of years before Christ.  Bronze Age in Armenia  The Armenia of pre-history was an empire unimaginably vast compared to today‚Äôs republic. Around the period of the Bronze Age, the Shengavitian culture thrived in a territory of about 1 million kilometers that stretched from today‚Äôs Northern Caucasus to Israel and from Central Anatolia to Central Iran. Early civilization began to emerge from Armenia with the formation of town- like settlements, temples, monumental architecture, a social classes, metal works, systematic transportation, etc. Sculptures of deities reached five meters high by one meter in diameter, and scenes of animal sacrifice, of water birds, snakes and plants from the time were painted onto the surfaces of rocks which became an archeological biography of early Armenia. Relics dating to the middle Bronze Age (2400-1600 BC) found in Armenia reveal a culture highly developed in jewelry making. Artifacts include colored ceramics, chariots, bronze weapons, gold and silver vessels. Linguists and archeologists say it was this period when the territory was inhabited by Indo-Europeans (more precisely Arians) whose leaders had acquired spiritual and secular power. And during that period the first known statehood formed, administered in Armenian, one of the main branches of Indo-European pre-language.  Iron Age in Armenia  In the late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age (15-9 centuries BC) several powerful states emerged in the Armenian plateau. The culture is characterized by ‚Äúcyclopic‚Äù castles built of massive stone blocks, which are wall surrounded settlements with surface of up to 100 hectares. Their number reached to 500 and held a culture that developed the early fertility cult, evidenced in monuments of phallic representation. And bronze sculptures of early heroes, and of animals bear striking resemblance to Hittite sculptural art.The earliest finds of cultivated plants in Armenia: evidencefrom charred remains and crop processing residues in pise¬¥from the Neolithic settlements of Aratashen and Aknashen, Roman Hovsepyan, George Wilcox, 2008 From 9-7 BC on the territory of Armenia was established one of the most powerful empires of the ancient world, the Urartian, or Van Kingdom, noted for its canonized architectural principles and proportional systems of separate buildings. The first cities with systematized layouts and landscape terra-forming features started to emerge (Erebuni, Teyshebaini, Tushpa, Argishtikhinili, etc.). The arts of jewelry, ceramics, armory forging, stone and bronze sculpture reached utmost development.‚ÄúArmenians‚Äù in Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture or EIEC, edited by J. P. Mallory and Douglas Q. Adams, published in 1997 by Fitzroy Dearborn.  Hellenistic culture in Armenia  The Hellenistic culture (4 BC ‚Äì 3 AD) heavily influenced portions of Armenia that remain until today. Cities such as Armavir, Arshamashat, Ervandashat, Tigranakert, and Artashat date to that time. (The latter was named by Greek chronologist Plutarch as the \\"Armenian Carthagena\\", most probably because the Artashat defense walls and castle towers were built on the advice of the greatest warriors of the ancient world Hannibal). The Kingdom of Armenia enjoyed its most powerful world influence in the 1st century BC under the reign of Tigran the Great. The wise and powerful leader built a strong state which started to compete in this region with the Roman Empire. But the Romans‚Äô second effort, led by Pompeus, successfully took part of Armenia. But, conceding to the stubborn resistance of the Armenian Highlanders, Rome gave up the notion of making another empire province. Instead, Emperor Neron invited Armenian King Trdat the First to Rome and officially inaugurated him King of Armenia. Armenia kept her independence, but under the patronage of the Roman Empire.

The individual buildings are Treasury Chambers, St Francis House, and Symons Building. They were designed by Richard Gailey and built in 1886 by George Gazzard. They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Three buildings, Treasury Chambers & St Francis House & Symons Building, were built in 1886 as prestige office accommodation and shops. Their construction reflected the atmosphere of prosperity and optimism generated in Queensland with the 1880s growth in real estate, construction and mining sectors. In 1885 James Hunter, boot manufacturer and property developer, took a 25-year lease from William Cribb on several adjoining allotments on the corner of George and Elizabeth Streets. Hunter anticipated the need for fashionable office accommodation close to the new government offices (Treasury Building) then under construction. He planned to erect, in two stages, a large L-shaped complex fronting George and Elizabeth Streets with accommodation for shops and offices. The building was designed by Richard Gailey and the contractor was George Gazzard. The first stage of the \\"Hunters Building\\" project, with frontages to George and Elizabeth Streets, was completed in 1886 for an estimated cost of . Financial problems prevented Hunter proceeding with the second stage - a corner section linking the George and Elizabeth Street buildings. In 1887 Hunter sub-let part of his lease to Denis O'Connor who built the Treasury Hotel on the corner site. In 1900 Hunter was declared bankrupt. Despite the \\"gap\\" between the Elizabeth Street section (St Francis House and Symons Building) and the George Street section (Treasury Chambers), the Hunter's Buildings was regarded as a unit. Newspaper reports indicate that a balcony connected all upper floor offices and this is consistent with the official address given for the upper floor tenants of the Elizabeth Street buildings as 183 George Street - this practice continued until 1923. The location and architectural distinction of the building attracted notable tenants. For the first two years various government departments were housed there until the William Street section of the Treasury Building was completed in 1889. In 1906, William Cribb donated the property to the YMCA which subsequently subdivided and sold most of the land by 1910. In the early 1920s, the George Street land was subdivided again and by the end of the decade various parts of the site were held on separate titles. Prominent long-term tenants were A P Greenfield & Co and Whitehouse Pianos. Their fellow-occupants included societies, workers in the professions and the skilled clothing trades and teachers of the arts. The Elizabeth Street buildings remained under one title (owned by the Caledonian Society) until 1949 when the present St Francis House was bought by the Order of Capuchin Franciscan Fathers. The fathers conducted masses and social events in their building until about 1970. A fire at the Caledonian Society rooms in 1948 destroyed the society's records and may have prompted the major changes to the facade of the present Symons Building. In 1960 the Caledonian Society moved to Kangaroo Point selling their Elizabeth Street building to the Symons family who renamed the building and used it as a suit factory for almost thirty years. In 1960 the back extension () of the Symons Building became the home of Charles Lisner's Academy Theatre, and later the first home of the Queensland Ballet Company. This artistic focus was accompanied by commercial and light industrial use of the Elizabeth Street buildings, during which period the interiors were altered substantially. In 1993 most of St Francis House & Symons Building were demolished, but the Elizabeth Street facades remain.  Description  Treasury Chambers, located in George Street opposite the Treasury Building, is a three storeyed rendered brick office building. Like the Treasury Building and the adjacent Treasury Hotel, the facade features classical detailing. The facade contains a narrow entry bay with a raised pediment and an oriel window and eight three-storeyed bays. Individual bays are marked by pilasters which rise through both upper levels and culminate in moulded capitals. The line of each pilaster is carried through to roof level by a projected section of cornice topped by a block in the parapet and a pedestal and ball above the parapet line. Each bay contains three window openings flanked by small pilasters with acanthus leaf capitals. A broad string course decorated with a row of rosettes separates the square-headed windows of the first floor from those on the upper level. These are arched and their keystones extend to a cornice embellished with brackets and a row of dentils. The balustraded parapet is pierced by arcaded openings. Pediments mark the end bay and the proposed central entry. The entry bay is further differentiated from the other bays by an oriel window which extends from the first floor and culminates in a balcony at the second floor. The ground floor facades have been altered to provide aluminium framed shop fronts. The suspended awning replaced a curved awning which had a barrel vault emphasising the entry. Internally, the ground floors to all the tenancies and most upper floors, have been altered. Some upper levels contain original fabric, including pressed metal ceilings. St Francis House & Symons Building (Elizabeth Street), 2009 St Francis House and Symons Building, with frontages to Elizabeth Street, were a continuation of Treasury Chambers. The facade of the northern end of the Elizabeth Street section, the Symons Building, has been rebuilt with unadorned reinforced concrete facade with metal windows. The facade of the southern section, St Francis House, consists of two bays which have been altered at the ground floor. Above this the two bays are differentiated by double height pilasters. Each bay contains three window openings on each level, those on the first floor level are square headed and those on the upper level arched. The facade is decorated with moulded plaster details including small pilasters with acanthus leaf capitals, rosettes, keystones, brackets, cornice and balustraded parapet.  Heritage listing  The Hunters Buildings were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The buildings, erected in the mid-1880s as a commercial investment, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being material evidence of the optimism generated by the economic prosperity of the era. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Importantly, the place demonstrates the principal characteristics of an 1880s prestige office building in Queensland, and the commercial work of acclaimed Brisbane architect Richard Gailey. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The buildings also exhibits aesthetic characteristics valued by the community, in particular its contribution to the George Street streetscape as part of a group of buildings of complementary scale and fine detail in this section of George Street between Queen and Elizabeth Streets, and its contribution to the Elizabeth Street streetscape through its scale and detailing.

He was the second son and ninth child of William Jeaffreson (1789‚Äì1865), a surgeon, and Caroline (died 1863), youngest child of George Edwards, tradesman there; and was named after his mother's uncle by marriage, John Cordy (1781‚Äì1828) of Worlingworth and Woodbridge. After education at the grammar schools of Woodbridge and Botesdale, he was apprenticed to his father in August 1845; but matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 22 June 1848, where among his undergraduate friends were the future novelists Henry Kingsley and Arthur Locker. After graduating B.A. in May 1852, Jeaffreson lived in London for about six years, working as a private tutor and lecturing in schools; and also began to write. From 1856 he was a journalist, writing from 1858 for the rest of his life for the Athenaeum. He became a student at Lincoln's Inn on 18 June 1856 and was called to the bar on 30 April 1859, but did not practise law. Jeaffreson moved in legal as well as in literary social circles. In 1860 he joined \\"Our Club\\", a literary group that was then a dining club, meeting weekly at Clunn's Hotel, Covent Garden. In 1872 Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, a friend and deputy keeper of the Public Records, invited Jeaffreson to become an inspector of documents for the Historical Manuscripts Commission, and after palaeographical training at the Public Record Office he began work in 1874. He then concentrated on preparing reports and calendars of manuscript records. After years of poor health, which brought his work to an end, Jeaffreson died on 2 February 1901 at his house in Maida Vale, and was buried in Paddington Cemetery, Willesden Lane. Works Jeaffreson initially wrote novels, publishing Crewe Rise in 1854 and next year Hinchbrook, which ran as a serial in Fraser's Magazine. During the next thirty years a long series of orthodox three-volume novels followed; Live it Down (1863) and Not Dead Yet (1864) were well received on publication. Novels and Novelists from Elizabeth to Victoria (1858), compiled at the British Museum, opened up a popularising vein that became Jeaffreson's main work, leading to: *A Book about Doctors (1860); *A Book about Lawyers (1866); *A Book about the Clergy (1870); *Brides and Bridals (1872); and *A Book about the Table (1874). On the recommendation of Hepworth Dixon, Jeaffreson collaborated with William Pole on the authorised biography of Robert Stephenson (1864, 2 vols.). Between 1876 and 1887 he published reports on 29 manuscript collections. Apart from private collections, he dealt with the archives of the boroughs of Chester, Leicester, Pontefract, Barnstaple, Plymouth, Ipswich, Wisbech, Great Yarmouth, Eye, Southampton, and King's Lynn, as well as of the West Riding and North Riding of Yorkshire and the county of Essex. At Leicester he also compiled an index to the muniments (1881). He edited four volumes for the Middlesex County Record Society (1886‚Äì92). Jeaffreson inspected the manuscript collection of Alfred Morrison, and he obtained the owner's permission to edit unpublished correspondence of Lord Byron and Lord Nelson. In The Real Lord Byron: New Views of the Poet's Life (2 vols. 1883) he wrote on Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley: Abraham Hayward and J. A. Froude wrote hostile reviews. His The Real Shelley: New Views of the Poet's Life (2 vols. 1885), was attacked by Edward Dowden. Jeaffreson's Lady Hamilton and Lord Nelson appeared in 1888 (2 vols.), and The Queen of Naples and Lord Nelson in 1889 (2 vols.; new edit. 1897). His other main works were: *The Annals of Oxford, 1870 (a popular work, much criticised) *Cutting for Partners, 3 vols. 1890XIX Century Fiction, Part I, A‚ÄìK. Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019. *A Book of Recollections, 2 vols. 1894 *A Young Squire of the Seventeenth Century, from the Papers of Christopher Jeaffreson of Dullingham House, Cambridgeshire, 2 vols. 1898 Family Jeaffreson married on 2 October 1860, at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn, Arabella Ellen, only surviving daughter of William Eccles, F.R.C.S.; she survived him with a daughter, who died on 28 September 1909.

Origins The earliest haunted dolls were poppets, effigies and voodoo objects which were created by early peoples for either religious or ceremonial purposes. These traditional objects were later acquired by various civilizations for mystical purposes or the occult. In Rome, dolls were used quite often in magical rituals to represent a connection with a god or goddess. Egyptian priests and magicians often used poppets for ceremonial purposes, to free the body of evil or to place curses on those who went against the will of the Gods. According to Wiccan beliefs, poppets have been used to place curses on members of a community, for religious, or traditional purposes. Some of the earliest effigies were used by African, Native American and European cultures. The European poppet has its roots in early Germanic and Scandinavian tribes who used them for ceremonial purposes. Modern day Wiccans have adapted this practice for their own uses. Most Wiccans believe a poppet is a symbolic representation of a person, and spells and other actions are performed on the poppet to transfer whatever might be affecting the targeted individual out of their body in something like a healing ritual. The Kongolese nkisi statuettes, and the bocio figurines used in Vodun traditions of Benin and Togo, are traditional effigy-like dolls of West and Central Africa believed by their practitioners to be \\"spirit embodying\\" forces that can also \\"heal or protect\\". Voodoo dolls are fairly modern novelty items. Their concept is thought to be based on European poppet dolls. Lom√© Fetish Market = West African Fetish Magic = Fetishism is defined by Merriam-Webster as worshiping an object believed to have magical power to protect or aid its owner. In West African culture, they used dolls placed inside or around homes, and for every wish or harm inflicted on another, a nail was driven into the doll's body. Additionally, chicken blood and other various liquids were often poured on the doll's body, and are described to have a malevolent ambience. Due to the alienness of African culture, Europeans in the 16th and 17th centuries grew to be wary of these objects and believed they were evidence of sorcery.  Psychology  Research around why people perceive dolls as \\"creepy\\" has been conducted with some varying conclusions. A 2013 study by psychologist Frank McAndrew named doll collecting as one of the creepiest hobbies an individual could have. Of the topic of creepiness McAndrew stated that it was related to uncertainty, as something \\"might be dangerous but you‚Äôre not sure it is\\". In a 2015 article for Smithsonian.com, writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie stated that \\"Dolls inhabit this area of uncertainty largely because they look human but we know they are not\\". Since the doll lacks ability to mimic, human brains at the most basic evolutionary tactic remain suspicious of whether or not it is human since they may expect the doll to mimic their own actions. This leads to feelings of physical coldness when the doll does not act the way one thinks it should.  The market  As of 2017, a market has arisen where consumers search for dolls that come with supposed paranormal phenomena. Movies about certain dolls, like Annabelle, have created a desire to explore claims of haunted dolls. According to Katherine Carlson of The New Yorker, such dolls bring with them a certain fascination that a regular doll does not, since \\"a haunted doll requires proof ‚Äî or at least enough of a backstory that a prospective buyer can embrace the possibility of the supernatural\\". The dolls are typically sold by private users and can be found for sale on eBay, Amazon, Etsy and many other sites. Carlson reports that sales listings are often accompanied by stories and claims detailing the background of the doll and claimed paranormal phenomena. Folklore professor Libby Tucker purchased an allegedly haunted doll for discussion in her Folklore of the Supernatural class, and said that the value of such items for folklore researchers is considerable. Chucky the doll from the movie Child's Play  Haunted dolls in pop culture  = Haunted dolls in movies = Dolls like Robert and Annabelle have been inspirations to movies. Child's Play, a movie produced and released in 1988, follows a killer doll named Chucky, and was inspired by the story of Robert The Doll. The popularity of the first movie led way to Child's play 2, and Child's Play 3. Being a hit, Chucky made its way into pop culture, being referenced in The Simpsons, and Saturday Night Live. The whole franchise grossed in more than 250 million U.S dollars. The doll Annabelle was the source of inspiration in the Annabelle series and the doll featured in The Conjuring. = Haunted dolls on TV = Haunted dolls have also made appearances in TV. In an episode of Ghost Adventures they visit a haunted Island of dolls. Additionally, a murdering haunted doll named \\"Talky Tina,\\" appeared in The Twilight Zone. The doll was inspired by the real life toy \\"Chatty Cathy.\\" This episode became inspiration to The Simpsons in a \\"Tree house of horror episode.\\" However, instead of it being \\"Talky Tina,\\" it was a Krusty the Clown doll toy. In the SpongeBob Squarepants episode \\"Sanitation Insanity,\\" Squidward and SpongeBob find a talking doll. The doll goes on to say that it wants to destroy Squidward. = Haunted dolls in other forms of media = A recurring bit on the podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me is \\"haunted doll watch\\", a segment where the brothers read descriptions of allegedly haunted dolls for sale on eBay. Famous haunted dolls Although tales of haunted dolls or cursed objects in general have a long history, a number of supposedly haunted dolls have appeared in popular culture in recent years. =Robert= Robert the doll Robert is a doll on display at the East Martello Museum in Key West, Florida, United States that was once owned by Key West painter and author Robert Eugene Otto. The doll is alleged to be possessed by spirits, and was the inspiration for Chucky, the doll in the 1988 horror film Child's Play. =Annabelle= Annabelle is a Raggedy Ann doll alleged by Ed and Lorraine Warren to be haunted and displayed in The Warren's Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut, United States. The doll served as the inspiration for the films The Conjuring and Annabelle. =Letta the Doll= Kerry Walton, of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia has appeared on a number of television programs with a doll he claims to have found while visiting an abandoned building in 1972 in Wagga Wagga, Australia. According to Walton, he named the doll \\"Letta Me Out\\" because of its supposedly supernatural characteristics. Kerry claims that people have seen the doll move in front of them, and that the doll has left visible scuff marks around the house. Currently, Letta Me Out is owned by Kerry in Warwick, Queensland. = Okiku = According to modern Japanese folklore, in 1918, a teenager named Eikichi Suzuki purchased a large doll from Hokkaido for his younger sister, Okiku, who gave the doll her name. When Okiku died, her family came to believe that Okiku's spirit was inhabiting the doll and the hair on the doll was growing. The doll resides in Mannenji Temple in Hokkaido, where it is claimed that a priest regularly trims Okiku's still-growing hair. =Pupa= According to stories published on the internet, Pupa is a doll said to \\"contain the spirit\\" of a dead Italian girl. =Mandy= Made in England or Germany between 1910 and 1920, Mandy is a porcelain baby doll donated to the Quesnel Museum in British Columbia in 1991. Mandy is also said to have supernatural powers. It is claimed that Mandy's eyes follow visitors as they walk in the room. The doll gained notoriety when it appeared alongside the curator and donor of the doll on the Montel Williams Show. =Pulau Ubin Barbie= According to Singapore legend, Pulau Ubin Barbie is a Barbie doll displayed in a memorial temple said to have supernatural powers.

He is one of the key members of Mono-ha, a group of artists who became prominent in the late 1960s and 1970s. Mono-ha was the name given to a loosely associated group of artists whose work was stridently anti-modernist‚Äîconsisting primarily of sculptures and installations that incorporated basic materials such as rocks, sand, wood, cotton, glass and metal, often in simple arrangements with minimal artistic intervention. From early on, Susumu Koshimizu's investigation of material and space resulted in some of Mono-ha's most definitive artworks. Koshimizu's installations and sculptures during the 1960s and 1970s focused on the qualities inherent to but not visible in an object. Yet, he shows concern for the materiality of objects‚Äîa desire to expose the fundamentals of sculpture, often revealed through juxtaposition. In Paper (formerly Paper 2) (1969), he placed a large stone inside an even larger envelope of Japanese paper, open on one side. Viewers were able to look inside and‚Äîin the sculptural context of relating interior structure to exterior form‚Äîwere confronted with the sheer size and solidity of the stone in contrast to the thin membrane of paper that covers it. Crack the Stone in August '70 consisted of an immense block of granite split in two at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. At that time, Koshimizu was exploring the fundamentals of sculpture without the need for juxtaposition: splitting open the stone and exposing its inside was a means to show the materiality and presence of the rock itself. At the beginning of the 1970s, Koshimizu started to explore specifically the structure of surfaces. A single installation, \\"From Surface to Surface (Wooden Logs Placed in a Radial Pattern on the Ground)\\" (1972/2004) is a good example. The work is composed of thirty, thirteen-foot-long square beams of wood, the surfaces of which have been sliced at varying intervals and angles to create undulating expanses of geometric form. Koshimizu's work since the 1980s has explored a variety of Japanese woods though the concept of \\"working tables.‚Äù  Exhibitions  Susumu Koshimizu's first solo exhibition was at Tamura Gallery in 1971. He represented Japan at the Venice Biennale in 1976 and 1980. Koshimizu has also been included in landmark surveys, such as \\"Reconsidering Monoha\\", National Museum of Art, Osaka, 2005; \\"Japanese Art after 1945: Scream Against the Sky\\", held at Yokohama Museum of Art, Guggenheim Museum Soho, New York, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1994; and \\"Japon des Avant Gardes 1910‚Äì1970\\", Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, 1986. Koshimizu's work has received renewed attention in the United States following his inclusion in \\"Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Monoha\\", at Blum & Poe, Los Angeles, in February 2012. This exhibition was the first survey of Monoha in the United States. Koshimizu work was also featured in Prima Materia at the Punta Della Dogana, Venice, in 2013. Also, his first solo show in the United States was held at Blum & Poe in February 2013. He has been constantly exhibiting at galleries and museums in Japan and overseas, including Kizahashi no Niwa (2015, Gallery Yamaki Fine Art). Susumu Koshimizu is represented by the galleries Blum & Poe (Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo), Tokyo Gallery + BTAP (Tokyo, Beijing), and Gallery Yamaki Fine Art (Kobe).

He taught for most of his career at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Honors and positions The Japanese government conferred on him the Order of the Rising Sun, and the Order of the Sacred Treasure, the highest decoration granted to a foreigner by Japan. He was one of seven foreign geographers, and the only American, honored by the Silver Medal of the Tokyo Geographical Society. He served in Japan as the representative of the Asia Foundation 1955‚Äì1960, and founding director of University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies, 1947‚Äì1957. He received the \\"Meritorious Contribution\\" award from the Association of American Geographers in 1956.Honors of the Association of American Geographers Education and academic career Hall joined the United States Army in 1913 and rose to the rank of captain as an intelligence officer in France during World War I. After the war, he became a student at the University of Michigan in 1920, where he obtained his bachelor's, master's, and in 1927, doctoral degree in the Department of Geography. His doctoral thesis was based on field work in Haiti. He became instructor in 1923, the year the department attained independent status, and was promoted to professor in 1938. In 1928 Hall did his first field work in Japan. When the Second World War began, Hall was studying the Japanese immigrants who had gone to Latin America. He was commissioned a lieutenant-colonel in the United States Army, directing operations of the Office of Strategic Services, first on the Pacific Coast, later in the China-India theater, where he was promoted to the rank of colonel. Following the war he returned to University of Michigan. He was president of the Association for Asian Studies in 1951 and served for many years on the board of the Social Science Research Council, including several years as chairman. The fifteen students he directed in their doctoral work chose Japan as the subject of their theses. Building Area studies Hall worked to develop the interdisciplinary study of Asia through the Area studies approach, both at University of Michigan and through the Association for Asian Studies and the Social Science Research Council. When he was appointed Director of the Center for Japanese Studies in 1947, he made clear that his policy was that the Center would train students in an additional strength, not one which would be an alternative to training in a discipline and that Area Studies would not drain students away from the established departments. The Center's executive committee included members from the departments of Anthropology, Fine Arts, Economics, and the Oriental Studies Program. Hall's study, Area Studies: With Special Reference to Their Implications for Research in the Social Sciences, published in 1947 for the SSRC, drew up the arguments in favor of the approach in order to organize government and foundation support. The Center established a research program in Okayama, Japan, in 1950. The program was partly made possible when Hall met directly with Douglas MacArthur, head of the American Occupation of Japan. He later received a telegram from the General saying that the project \\"appears to be boldly planned and soundly conceived\\" and should \\"result in a body of knowledge which will prove of inestimable value...\\" Hall stayed in Japan as representative of the Asia Foundation until 1960.

Jones Jr. (September 18, 1941 ‚Äì January 14, 2017) was an African- American Roman Catholic deacon, preacher and leader who converted from Pentecostalism to Catholicism. Biography Jones was born in 1941. He graduated from Wayne State University in 1965 with a degree in art education. From 1975 to 1982, he was the senior minister in the Zion Congregational Church of God in Christ, the second oldest Pentecostal church in Detroit, Michigan, and from 1982 to 2000 he was the senior minister in Maranatha Christian Church, an Evangelical Charismatic church in Detroit. Jones' road to conversion began in 1998, when he read the book Crossing the Tiber by Catholic apologist Stephen Ray, and thereafter began conducting some church services using Catholic liturgy. This prompted many members of the church to leave. The remaining adult members of the Maranatha Christian Church voted 39 to 19 to begin the process of converting to Catholicism in June 2001. In September 2001, the remaining members started studies at St. Suzanne's Parish of the Roman Catholic Church. Jones himself converted to the Roman Catholic faith that year and led some family members to join the Catholic faith. Jones' conversion was not well received by some Catholics, and Jones' mother left to join Detroit's Perfecting Church. Maranatha closed in December 2001 and the church building was sold to a Greek Othodox Church. The church voted to give Alex Jones a severance package. In 2007, Jones received a Masters in Pastoral Studies degree from the Sacred Heart Major Seminary. Jones has written a book entitled No Price too High, detailing the circumstances of his conversion to the Roman Catholic faith. He was a member of the Prince of Peace Catholic Church. Personal life Jones died on January 15, 2017, due to heart attack complications. Jones is survived by a wife and three grown sons.

The facility houses low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) transmitter and antenna systems, and certification of the new U.S. Navy Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) ground terminals is in progress as of early 2015. Installations The joint American, Italian, and NATO facility houses an AN/FRT-95A Low Frequency Radio Transmitting System, hosts a USAF HF SCOPE Command, part of the High Frequency (HF) Global Communications System (HFGCS) and a US Navy MUOS Ground Station. The surrounding antenna field supports one 827 foot LF antenna, 44 HF (3‚Äì30 MHz) antennas, three MUOS Earth Terminal parabolic antennas, and 2 UHF Directional Helical antennas for satellite direction finding. Several different types of HF antenna are installed, though the majority are no longer in use. 116 Antenna towers are installed which hold aloft 35 antenna transmission lines. Antenna types include four Horizontal Log Periodic (HLPA) with 2 tall towers each, four rotatable log periodic (RLPA), seven Horizontal Omnidirectional Broadband (HOBA) each with 4 antenna towers, seven High Take- Off Angle (HTOA), 11 Dual Mode (DM) antennae held aloft with 7 towers each, 1 Spira-cone, and 10 decommissioned Horizontal/Vertical HF Loop Antennae. The LF Transmitter uses non-line-of-sight propagation for communication with submarines. Local opposition Since 2009 the station has become the target of protests by the people of Niscemi, citing concerns over the expansion of the site, which is located inside the Riserva Naturale Sugherata di Niscemi, a protected Site of Community Importance, and the possible harmful effects of electromagnetic radiation on the local wildlife and inhabitants from the MUOS ground stations. In the face of the protests, in March 2013 the regional government revoked authorisation for the installation of MUOS, and commissioned an independent study by the Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† (\\"Higher Health Institute\\"). The ISS report, issued in July 2013, concluded that there was no evidence that electromagnetic emissions posed a risk, but recommended further monitoring, and authorisation was re-granted. Local \\"No- MUOS\\" committees then organized demonstrations, and blocked road access to the site. In the face of this opposition the United States authorities have repeatedly stated that emissions from the site are well below agreed safety standards, and point to the operation of a similar site in Hawaii that has not reported any problems or incidents.

It was designed by Alexander Robertson McKellar and built in 1917 by George Varley Boyce. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The First World War Honour Board was erected by employees of the Queensland Lands Department in 1917, as a tribute to fellow staff on active service. The overall design was created by Alexander Robertson McKellar, a draftsman in the lithographic branch of the survey section. The affixed metal plaque was designed by Arnold Vivan Thomas, the officer in charge of the lithographic branch. Manufacture was carried out at the Queensland Government railway workshops at Ipswich, and the wood carving was crafted by noted local wood carver George Varley Boyce, who taught carving at Brisbane technical schools from c.1902 to 1916. The honour board was unveiled by the then Governor of Queensland, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams, on 2 May 1917. It remains a focus for Anzac Day commemoration, with wreaths being laid before the honour board each April 25. The board was restored by the Lands Department in 1981.  Description  World War I Honour Board dedicated to the Queensland Lands Department Officers and some authorised surveyors who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Forces during the First World War, 1917 The honour board is affixed to the wall of the main corridor on the first floor of the Lands Administration Building in Brisbane, immediately opposite the George Street elevator. It is a large honour board, high by wide, constructed of Queensland silky oak. A central panel of red bean bears the Queensland coat of arms and the gold-painted names of 94 departmental staff and authorised surveyors who served in the First World War. The surrounds are carved in a stippled pattern with lotus plants (an ancient symbol of sleep) in relief in the lower section. The latter rarely appear on Queensland war memorials. Within a rich moulding of laurel leaves in the upper left hand corner is an oval-shaped metal plaque depicting in bas relief a cavalry charge and infantry soldiers advancing in battle, intended to illustrate the different fighting units in action. A carved scroll unfolds from the plaque and bears the relief lettering Roll of Honour. The whole board is set into a simple frame.

He was the last fully independent Griqua Kaptijn of Griqualand West, and after it became a British colony, his rule and that of his successors was largely nominal. Early life He was the eldest son of Andries Waterboer who had founded the Waterboer dynasty, and his wife Gertruida Pienaar. After his father's death in 1852, Nicolaas was proclaimed the Kaptijn (Captain) of Griqualand West at the Kaptijn's Residence in Griekwastad (\\"Griquatown\\"). Rule (1852-1896) He ruled during the tumultuous era that followed the discovery of diamonds on his land in the 1860s. As enormous numbers of \\"diggers\\" arrived and the population of the diamond fields exploded, tensions grew between the different groups - including the Griquas, the indigenous Tswana people, the Boers and the white English diggers. Disagreements ensued on exactly what the borders of the semi- nomadic Griquas' land was, and a range of regional states, including the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State vied for ownership of the land. The Cape Colony meanwhile, the largest and most powerful state in the region, was uniquely uninterested in any form of union with the territory, in spite of strong pressure from the British to enact a form of union. Against the backdrop of the land tensions, the diggers, led by the eccentric Stafford Parker, proclaimed the independent \\"Diggers/Klipdrift Republic\\" in 1870, but it was swiftly annexed to the British Empire as the separate colony of Griqualand West. After briefly moving to Griqualand East, Waterboer moved back to his official residence in Griekwastad in 1874 to reassume his traditional rulership.E.J. Verwey: New Dictionary of South African Biography, Volume 1.

It was designed by Thomas Ramsay Hall and built from 1912 to 1928 by Andrew Gillespie. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 December 1997.  History  Frank McDonnell, 1924 Hubert East This three-storeyed brick department store building was erected in several stages between 1912 and 1963, for the Brisbane firm of McDonnell & East Ltd. In 1886, Irishmen Frank McDonnell and Hubert East emigrated to Brisbane, where they were employed in the drapery trade. From 1889, McDonnell was closely connected with the movement for the early closing of shops. He entered Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1896 as the Labour member for Fortitude Valley, and largely due to his efforts, early closing was introduced in 1900. In October 1901, the firm of McDonnell & East Ltd was established and, with the financial backing of businessman and publican Peter Murphy, owner of the Transcontinental Hotel, the firm purchased John Reid's drapery business, and the lease of the premises, at 402-408 George Street. Within six years McDonnell & East Ltd was well established as a firm of importers, cash drapers, tailors, outfitters, dressmakers and milliners. About 1908, Jack McDonnell and Fraser and Harry East, sons of the founders, entered the firm. In 1911, McDonnell & East Ltd acquired the adjoining George Street allotments to the corner of Tank Street, and in October 1911 Brisbane architect Thomas Ramsay Hall called tenders for a new brick building. The contract was let to Andrew Gillespie with a price of , which included electrical fittings, counter, fixtures and passenger lift. Construction began in January 1912, and the new building, advertised as the White Store, was occupied in April 1913. The company continued to lease the original building. Following the success of the White Store, which doubled profits within a year, the company purchased a contiguous block in Tank Street, behind the new showrooms, in 1913. In mid-1914 TR Hall again called tenders for a store for McDonnell & East Ltd, and the contract was let to New Farm builder Mark Doggett, with a price of . This building was completed late in 1914, but it is not clear whether it remains as part of the present complex. The business flourished, assisted by the re-location of the Brisbane Markets to Roma Street in 1915, and the proximity of the tram stops in George Street and the Roma Street railway station, which brought custom. McDonnell & East Ltd became a public company in 1920. Between and 1921, McDonnell & East Ltd acquired another three adjacent sites: a property in Turbot Street; the allotment occupied by the original George Street store; and a laneway running in from Tank Street, which was closed in exchange for the company's creating a laneway in from Turbot Street. In the mid-1920s, architects Thomas Ramsay Hall and George Gray Prentice designed substantial three-storeyed extensions for these sites. The work was carried out by contractor Francis Joseph Corbett, who started in late 1925 and finished in March 1928. The original leased premises, fronting George Street, were demolished and replaced with a three- storeyed extension of the 1912 building. A separate but adjoining three- storeyed building was erected on the Tank Street sites. The extensions conformed with the 1912 street elevations, and featured the latest fittings, elevators and modern conveniences. At the same time, new shop fronts were installed in the corner building by contractors Robertson & Corbett. The founders of the firm just lived to see the extensions completed: Hubert East died in May 1928, and Frank McDonnell followed him six months later. Fraser East and Jack McDonnell took over as joint managing directors. The renovations and extensions, which cost approximately , immediately boosted the status of McDonnell & East Ltd and George Street as a trading centre. The design allowed for further additions in Tank Street, but the Great Depression and World War II thwarted this proposal. The George Street Post Office was located in the McDonnell & East Ltd building from 27 July 1931 until 28 September 1990. The area was let to the Postmaster General's Department free of charge for the first ten years, with the fittings supplied by the store. The office was manned by PMG staff. After the Second World War business flourished once again, and by 1967 McDonnell & East Ltd had purchased all the property fronting Tank Street to North Quay; all the allotments facing North Quay up to, but excluding, the church at the corner of Turbot Street; and another allotment fronting Turbot Street. The site in Tank Street adjoining the 1928 building was acquired in 1950. It contained a two-storeyed building, into which McDonnell & East Ltd expanded. In 1960 this building was reconstructed as a three-storeyed extension of the McDonnell & East Ltd store. No attempt was made to design a street facade to conform with the 1912-1928 building. A large, free customer car park, occupying most of the remainder of McDonnell & East Ltd's property at the rear of the store, was constructed in stages between about 1956 and 1969. This no longer survives. Substantial renovations were carried out in the 1960s: the street level windows were remodelled in 1960; a number of small buildings at the rear of the store were demolished and replaced with a three-storeyed extension, creating an L-shape, in 1963; and in 1964 all remaining dividing walls on the three levels were removed. The Queensland Room Coffee Lounge and Gallery was opened in 1965, and won an international award for a community service project in a retail store. In 1984, McDonnell & East Ltd was taken over by an investment group, but the family name was retained. The sale of its fashion and homewares businesses meant that this particular company's well known city/surburban set up had shifted from a middle market positioning to a vision of an upmarket department store chain in direct competition with national interstate-based chains like Myer, David Jones Limited and Waltons targeting large population centres in Queensland. The chain's 1980s over-expansion and the ever-growing dominance of the department stores duopoly beating out the Queensland-based department store chain landed the chain at the end of the decade in a position where it couldn't compete with its national counterparts and in financial difficulties by 1990 and its de-listing by its investment company that saw the decline of the Brisbane-based retail empire, and the Garden City Upper Mount Gravatt (opened 1970), Westfield Shoppingtown Toombul (opened 1984 and closed by 1987, on the site of a former Barry & Roberts store, and replacing the original Target store in that location which had closed in 1982), Rockhampton Shopping Fair (opened 1985), Nerang Street Mall Southport (opened 1986), The Galleria Surfers Paradise's Holiday City store (also opened 1986), Toowoomba (Pigott's Building) (acquired 1983) and Warwick (acquired 1983) stores closed by January 1991. The George Street (the chain's original flagship city store, opened 1901), Pacific Fair (opened 1977) and Ipswich (opened 1987) stores - as well as its sister Queensland-based Pikes menswear - it acquired in 1975 - ,Britches jeanswear and New Trend curtain and wallpaper chains initially survived, although they were subsequently downsized (the Ipswich store in particular became a 'glorified' fashion boutique before closing in 1993), and closed altogether in March 1994 (after closing in Pacific Fair a few months earlier). The building was reported to be derelict in 2004, when a man was found trapped in the building, having suffered serious injuries after falling down a lift well. The accident resulted in Lord Mayor Campbell Newman ordering inspections of all the empty buildings in Brisbane's inner city. In late 2005, the building was bought by De Martini and John Fletcher Properties Group and Rohrig Constructions for $8.38 million. It was redeveloped with retail spaces fronting George Street and Tank Street, and office space throughout the remainder of the building. The redevelopment won an Australian Property Institute excellence in property award for heritage property in 2007, and Rio Tinto leased most of the new office space as the building's anchor tenant. In December 2007, the building was sold to Lend Lease for more than $45 million.  Description  McDonnell and East department store, circa 1950 The building is three storeys high with a basement. It combines characteristics of many of the styles from the first quarter of the century. It has a Federation red brick and stucco facade and Art Nouveau lettering. The detailing reflects both the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau styles. The building is of red brick with stucco render originally painted cream. The George Street facade has since been painted beige and its details picked out in a deep green. The George Street facade has six window bays and is divided into two equal sections of three. The central bay of each section has a pediment above its upper level window. All the windows on the George Street frontage have had the glazing painted over in the same colour as the walls with frames painted green. The Tank Street frontage retains its alternating red brick and white rendered bays. There are four brick sections, which contain individual window bays. The first two rendered sections have two window bays while the end section has four. The upper level windows in the rendered bays have semi-circular arched openings, with three courses of unrendered brick above them for emphasis. All the windows in the rendered sections are grouped in pairs that are separated by unrendered bands of brick that have their bonding pattern picked out. White painted downpipes run down the wall in these locations. Raised lettering with the name of the store and the goods it provided are a feature of both facades. There are raised sections of parapet centred over each pediment on the George Street facade and above each unrendered brick bay on the Tank Street facade. Flagpoles are located behind each raised section of parapet. A small curved portion flanks the sides of each raised parapet. The facade has protruding sills supported on decorative stucco brackets and similar hood moulds over the upper level windows. Internally the original pressed metal remains above the modular suspended ceilings. This is completely exposed in the basement level and in some store rooms. The building has suffered from the addition of modern shopfronts, the removal of the original awning and the painting of the George Street facade, but still contributes greatly to the streetscapes of both George and Tank Streets.  Heritage listing  McDonnell & East Ltd Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 December 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

The McDonnell & East Ltd Building is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early 20th century department store, including the incorporation of advertising into the facade to illustrate the building's function. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The McDonnell & East Ltd Building is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by the community, in particular the quality of the street elevations, with the stepped parapet, ornamental detail and lettering, and paired window openings which give the facades a rhythmic quality. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building has a special association with the Brisbane firm of McDonnell & East Ltd and their contribution to the development of a department store culture in Brisbane in the early 20th century. The McDonnell & East Ltd Building also has special association with influential Brisbane architects TR Hall and GG Prentice, as an example of their commercial work.

Early life Bulcock was born at Mount Arapiles, near Horsham, Victoria in 1892 to Thomas Bulcock and his wife Eliza Mackay (n√©e Grove). After completing his schooling at local schools he studied veterinary science at Sydney Technical College and won a Department of Agriculture bursary to Wagga Wagga Experiment Farm. In 1914 Bulcock moved to Western Queensland and became involved with the Australian Workers' Union.Frank William (1892‚Äì1973) - Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 27 February 2015. Politics In 1919, premier T. J. Ryan decided to enter federal politics and resigned as the member for Barcoo. Bulcock, representing the Labor Party, easily won the by-election over rival J.P. Boland and held the seat for the 23 years. During this time he was Secretary for Agriculture and Stock from 1932 till 1942 and in 1939 was a delegate on a South African study tour. Bulcock resigned from parliament in 1942 to take up a position with the federal government under Prime Minister, John Curtin. = Role in the release of the cane toad pest species = In 1935, cane toads were brought over from Hawaii, by Assistant Entomologist RW Mungomery, as an attempt to control the native grey-backed cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum) and French's beetle (Lepidiota frenchi). This was done despite Mungomery noting that they would not be effective. The retired NSW Government Entomologist Walter Froggatt opposed the toad releases, and successfully lobbied the Australian Department of Health to ban them in November 1935, writing \\"This giant toad, immune from enemies, omnivorous in its habits, and breeding all year round, may become as great a pest as the rabbit or cactus\\". Then Minister for Agriculture and Stock, Bulcock was instrumental in convincing the Queensland premier William Forgan Smith to persuade the Prime Minister Joseph Lyons that the ban on the release of cane toads be overturned. The releases were therefore continued from September 1936, creating an ecological disaster that persists to this day while simultaneously failing to control the target cane beetle species. Federal Service. Bulcock was appointed as Commonwealth director-general of agriculture. In this position he organized the wartime planning of essential agricultural production and labor requirements. Following his resignation from this position he took up an appointment to the Scarce Commodities Committee which met in Washington, D.C., USA with responsibility for fertilisers, phosphate rock and sulphur. Personal life On Christmas Day in 1917, Bulcock married Florence Violet Edwards in Sydney and together had two children. He retired in 1959 but continued to campaign for the Labor Party at election time. Bulcock died in 1973 at Mount Nebo, Queensland, and was cremated.

He is the first Danish manager to win the German Bundesliga. During his playing career, Jacobsen predominantly played as a left wingman, and most prominently represented Danish team GOG H√•ndbold and German team THW Kiel. He won three Danish Handball League championships with GOG, as well as three Handball-Bundesliga championships and two European EHF Cup titles with Kiel. Jacobsen played a total 148 games and scored 584 goals for the Denmark national handball team from 1991 to 2003, and was named 1993 and 1999 Danish Handball Player of the Year. Playing career Born in Viborg, Nikolaj Jacobsen moved with his parents to Southern Funen as a child, and began playing handball at the age of 11. He was a skilled association football player as well, and was among the most talented Danish youth football players, while also playing for the Denmark youth national handball team. Having played youth handball at GOG H√•ndbold, Nikolaj Jacobsen made his senior debut for the club in 1990, at the age of 18. At GOG, Jacobsen played both centre backcourt and left wingman. He became known as a highly skilled player, able to score goals with wide variety of shots. In his second senior year, Jacobsen made his debut for the senior Denmark national handball team, under national team coach Anders Dahl-Nielsen. Under coach Bent Nyegaard, Jacobsen and GOG won the 1992 Danish Handball League, and the following year, Jacobsen was named Danish Handball Player of the Year. He helped GOG win the 1995 and 1996 Danish Handball Leagues, and became top goalscorer of the Danish 1997 season, with 205 goals scored. In 1997, at the age of 26, Jacobsen moved to German Handball-Bundesliga team TSV Bayer Dormagen. Jacobsen scored 189 goals in 28 Bundesliga matches during the 1998 season, though Bayer Dormagen finished in 14th placed, and were eventually relegated. However, Jacobsen had caught the attention of reigning Bundesliga champions THW Kiel, and following one year at Bayer Dormagen, he moved on to Kiel. At Kiel, Jacobsen was coached by German coach Zvonimir Serdaru≈°iƒá, and it was here he became one of the best left wingmen in the world. The temperamental Jacobsen was also taught to be a team player, by his new Swedish teammates Magnus Wislander, Staffan Olsson and Stefan L√∂vgren. When Jacobsen complained that Stefan L√∂vgren would not play him the ball, L√∂vgren replied: \\"When you talk nicely, you will get the ball.\\" Jacobsen and L√∂vgren soon became close friends. In the following three seasons, Jacobsen scored 1015 goals in a total 142 games for Kiel, as the club won two Handball Bundesliga championships and two German Cup titles. Kiel also finished second in the international 1999‚Äì2000 EHF Champions League tournament, losing 52‚Äì54 on aggregate to FC Barcelona Handbol in the final. On 27 September 1998, Jacobsen set a new record for most goals scored in a match for the Denmark national team, when he scored 15 goals against the Greece national handball team, in a qualification match for the 1999 World Handball Championship. Denmark won the game 33‚Äì20. The previous record of 14 goals in a game had been set by Flemming Hansen in 1971, and had been equalled by left wingman Lars Christiansen in another game against Greece, only four days before Jacobsen broke the record. Jacobsen was once again named Denmark Handball Player of the Year in 1999, and was selected for the 1999‚Äì2000 Bundesliga All-Star Team. In the opening game of the 2001‚Äì02 Bundesliga season, Jacobsen injured his knee when he collided with the goalkeeper of opposing team SG Wallau/Massenheim. The injury became a recurring problem, and the following three seasons, Jacobsen played only 72 games, scoring 331 goals for Kiel. He still helped the club win another Bundesliga championship, as well as two international EHF Cup titles. The injury also meant, that Jacobsen was absent from the Denmark team which won bronze medals at the 2002 European Championship. Unable to fully recover from his injury, Jacobsen left Kiel in 2004 and moved back to Denmark to become player-coach. Coaching career Nikolaj Jacobsen moved to Viborg HK in the Danish Handball League; the club of his birth town of Viborg. While at Viborg HK, Jacobsen undertook a teacher education, and coached handball at Viborg HK's sports college. At Viborg HK, Jacobsen played under Danish head coach Ulrik Wilbek. When Wilbek left to coach the Denmark national handball team, Jacobsen became assistant coach to new head coach S√∏ren Hildebrand, while still maintaining his active career. Jacobsen scored 71 goals in 28 league games for Viborg during his time at the club, but focused increasingly on his role as assistant coach. In Jacobsen's time at Viborg, the club finished runners-up in the 2007 Danish Handball League, and reached two Danish Cup finals. Nikolaj Jacobsen at BSV in 2011. In 2007, Jacobsen moved to rival Danish Handball League club Bjerringbro- Silkeborg Voel (BSV), to fill the role of assistant coach to Danish head coach Carsten Albrektsen. Jacobsen did also play a few games for BSV, scoring six goals in nine league matches. BSV finished runners-up twice and in third place once, in the five seasons Jacobsen spent with the club. During his time at BSV, Jacobsen clashed with management over coaching principles, and even considered ending his coaching career. It was time for Jacobsen to become head coach, and he moved to Danish Handball League team Aalborg H√•ndbold in 2012. He brought former teammate Morten Bjerre with him, as assistant coach. In his first season at the club, Aalborg won the 2013 Danish Handball League, and finished runners-up in his second season. By then, Jacobsen had announced his intention to leave Aalborg in 2014. Jacobsen joined German Handball-Bundesliga team Rhein-Neckar L√∂wen, replacing Icelandic coach Gu√∞mundur Gu√∞mundsson who had just become head coach of the Denmark national handball team. In his first season with Rhein-Neckar L√∂wen, Jacobsen led the team to finish runners-up in the Bundesliga. In his second year at the club, L√∂wen won the 2016 Bundesliga, their first Handball-Bundesliga championship, which also made Jacobsen the first Danish manager to win the Handball-Bundesliga. The following season, L√∂wen successfully reclaimed the Bundesliga championship. In March 2017, Jacobsen was appointed head coach of the Denmark national handball team, while still coaching Rhein-Neckar L√∂wen. He replaced Gu√∞mundur Gu√∞mundsson as national coach for Denmark.

It is relatively easy to cultivate, and even the type specimen provided to the taxonomist, Robert Brown was \\"...furnished us by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, of Hammersmith, West London who received the seeds, from which they raised it, from Port Jackson\\". Description The purple flag is a densely-tufted perennial herb growing to a height of about 60 cm. It has stiff, erect grass-like green leaves 15‚Äì60 cm long and 2‚Äì6 mm wide, that are finely striated, glabrous except for the margins which have fine hairs and near the base which is covered with short white hairs. The flower stalk is 3‚Äì55 cm long and the petals (strictly outer tepals) are roughly oval in shape, 20‚Äì30 mm long, 15‚Äì25 mm wide and blue- violet in colour. The flowers appear in spring and summer and each lasts for less than a day. Taxonomy and naming Patersonia sericea was first described in 1807 by Robert Brown in Curtis's Botanical Magazine. The specific epithet (sericea) is derived from the Latin word sericus meaning \\"silken\\", referring to the hairs at the base of the juvenile leaves. Distribution and habitat The purple flag occurs in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria (Australia) where it grows in dry sclerophyll forest, woodland and heath, preferring sandy, well-drained soil on the coast and ranges. Conservation Patersonia sericea is not considered to be at risk in the wild. Cultivation The purple flag is a reliable species in cultivation, thriving in hot, dry situations and is also frost tolerant. It is useful grown en masse in a bed of perennial plants. Ecology Patersonia sericea is used as larval food by two species of butterfly, the eastern iris-skipper (Mesodina halyzia) and montane iris-skipper (Mesodina aeluropis).

ESF was invented by Alessandro Fais, an Italian metallurgical engineer and scientist. ESF is obtained by inserting loose, binder-less powders into the automatic dosing system, or manually inserted in the mold. The automatic procedure applies a pre-pressure onto the powders to ensure electrical contact; hence, it superimposes an intense electromagnetic pulse with a mechanical pulse. The two pulses last 30 to 100 ms. After a brief holding time, the sintered component is extracted by the lower plunger and pushed out by the extractor to leave room for the next sintering. Each sintering round lasts less than one second, and is carried out entirely in air (even with pyrophoric materials).

The 1986 iteration of the Constitution of the Philippines allows for two autonomous regions: in the Cordilleras and in Muslim Mindanao. Currently Bangsamoro which largely consists of the Muslim-majority areas of Mindanao is the only autonomous region in the country.  Current autonomous region  = Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao = On October 15, 2012, a preliminary agreement was signed by the Government of the Philippines' chief negotiator Marvic Leonen, MILF Peace Panel Chair Mohagher Iqbal and Malaysian facilitator Tengku Dato' Ab Ghafar Tengku Mohamed along with President Aquino, Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia, MILF chairman Al-Hajj Murad Ebrahim and Secretary-General Ekmeleddin ƒ∞hsanoƒülu of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation at Malaca√±ang Palace in Manila. It replaced the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and was formed after voters decided to ratify the Republic Act no. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law in a January 21 plebiscite. The ratification was announced on January 25, 2019, by the Commission on Elections. This marked the beginning of the transition of the ARMM to the BARMM.  Former autonomous region  = Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao = right The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was proposed in 1976 during the Ferdinand Marcos administration and created on August 1, 1989 through Republic Act No. 6734 (otherwise known as the Organic Act) in pursuance with a constitutional mandate. In 2012 President Benigno Aquino III described ARMM as a \\"failed experiment\\". He proposed an autonomous region named Bangsamoro to replace ARMM with the agreement between the government and Moro Islamic Liberation Front. A plebiscite was held in the provinces of Basilan, Cotabato, Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, Davao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Palawan, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur; and in the cities of Cotabato, Davao, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos, Koronadal, Iligan, Marawi, Pagadian, Puerto Princesa and Zamboanga to determine if their residents wished to be part of the ARMM. Of these areas, only four provinces (Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi) voted in favor of inclusion in the new autonomous region. The ARMM was officially inaugurated on November 6, 1990 in Cotabato City, which was designated as its provisional capital. The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) ceased to exist after a two-part 2019 plebiscite that ratified the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). It was replaced with the new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and now under the interim government, Bangsamoro Transition Authority.  Proposed autonomous regions  = Cordilleras = The Cordillera Administrative Region administers the area that was designated for an autonomous region. Two plebiscites were held in the Cordilleras, the latest in 1998, to create an autonomous region and both failed. There have been bills filed in the Congress of the Philippines to re-propose and establish an autonomous region in the Cordilleras but none of these efforts succeeded. In 1990 plebiscite, which was held to create an autonomous region under Republic Act No. 6766, only Ifugao voted in favor of the law's ratification. The component provinces of the Cordillera Administrative Region at the time and the city of Baguio participated in the vote with only localities voting in favor of the law's ratification to be part of a new autonomous region in the Cordilleras. However only Ifugao voted in favor of the organic law and there was a failed attempt to establish an autonomous region with a single province. = Metro Manila = It was proposed that the National Capital Region or Metro Manila be converted to an autonomous region. Metro Manila is governed by mayors of its 16 highly urbanized cities and 1 independent municipality with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority serving as an advisory body to the local government units of the metropolis. Former Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista had advocated for a Metro Manila autonomous region as an alternative to President Duterte's campaign to shift the system of national government to federalism which would render Metro Manila as an independent federal state within the Philippines.

She was the first woman to perform a heart transplant and is a former president of the United Network for Organ Sharing. Early life Allen was raised in Des Moines, Iowa, where she became interested in science at a young age. She would gather insects and things with her father and examine them under a microscope. He would also take her on science-like trips to further her interest in the sciences. After high school, she completed an undergraduate degree in zoology at Swarthmore College. During summer breaks from Swarthmore, she worked in a high-altitude biology in Crested Butte, Colorado studying the nitrogen conserving abilities of different animals. She originally planned to study physiology in graduate school but thought that a medical degree would provide her with more career options.  Higher education  In 1970, Allen enrolled at the University of California San Diego to become a Doctor of Medicine. From the various medical schools she could have attended, she decided upon UCSD because it was a brand new program that recruited professors from all over the country. While in medical school, Allen worked in a vascular surgeon's lab who was implanting experimental hearts into cows. This was her first experience with cardiothoracic surgery. After graduating from medical school, Allen completed a five-year residency in general surgery at Oakland Medical Center (then the Kaiser Foundation Hospital) and a two-year residency in cardiothoracic surgery at King's College Hospital in London. While finishing her time in London, she was selected to complete a five-year residency program at Stanford University School of Medicine. Before doing so, Allen took a year to travel the world, spending six months in Papua New Guinea practicing in the hospital as a country-licensed physician. After her six in Papua New Guinea, she returned to the U.S. to undertake the residency in cardiac surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine in 1982. At Stanford, she trained under the tutelage of Norman Shumway, a pioneer in heart transplantation, and became the first woman in the world to transplant a heart. During her residency, Allen helped a neighbor graduate student with her linguistic project in which a gorilla taught her how to communicate in sign language. At the end of her residency in 1985, Allen joined the surgical faculty of the University of Washington.  Career  She founded the University of Washington Medical Center's heart transplant program, which was the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest region, and was its director until 1996. She was awarded \\"Woman of the Year\\" by the International Women's Forum in 1990 and was named one of the \\"Best Doctors in America\\" for five consecutive years beginning in 1992. In 1994, she was elected national president of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the first woman to hold the position. As president, she conducted an organ allocation analysis, reduced the time waiting for transplants, and increased awareness of organ donation in minority communities. In 1995, she shared the computerized technology of matching donated organs for transplant patients in Smithsonian Institution Computerworld Award in Medicine. In 1996, the chief of surgery at UW removed Allen as transplant director. Allen was appointed professor in the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of Washington in 1998. In 2000, however, she settled a sex-discrimination suit with the university after having worked there for 25 years. She received a settlement of $750,000 US dollars but was forced to resign from the cardiac transplant program and cease all of her research that has any tie to the University of Washington. She was the medical director of the Hope Heart Institute, a public health charity, where she was involved in several programs to promote heart disease prevention. State Representative Jim McDermott nominated Allen as a Local Legend in 2003. In 2004, the institute merged with the Benaroya Research Institute, where she became a member of the Hope Heart Matrix Biology Program.

A native of Dundee, Crumley began his football career with Junior club Harp, from where he moved into the senior ranks, spending the 1911‚Äì12 Scottish League season with Dundee Hibernian. He played in America for two seasons, then returned to Scotland where he kept goal for Central League team Arbroath before serving with the Royal Engineers during the First World War. He resumed his football career with a brief return to Dundee Hibs, then moved south of the border to play for Swansea Town, initially in the Southern League and then for three seasons in the English Football League. This was followed by a year with Bristol City, two seasons with Darlington, whom he helped gain promotion to the Second Division, and three years with Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic where he finished his career. Personal life Crumley was born in Dundee in 1890, the son of William Ferguson Crumley, a tinsmith. His older brother, Bob Crumley, also played professionally as a goalkeeper, and was in the Dundee team that won the 1910 Scottish Cup Final, defeating Clyde after two replays. The passenger list when he sailed for America in 1912 listed his occupation as that of blacksmith. During the First World War, Crumley joined the Royal Engineers. By mid-1915, he was a section corporal stationed near Dundee, and he went to reach the rank of sergeant and served in France. He was twice mentioned in despatches, and was wounded and affected by shell shock. He married Eva Caroline Camamile at All Saints' Church, Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire, in 1921. In 1932, while working as traffic manager for a lorry firm, Crumley suffered head injuries when the lorry he was travelling in struck a stationary vehicle; his two colleagues were killed. At the time, he was living in the Kensington district of London. His death at the age of 90 was registered in the second quarter of 1981 in the Merton registration district, which covers the London Borough of Merton. Football career =Early career= Crumley joined Dundee Hibernian from Junior club Harp in September 1911. The Courier thought the club had \\"done a good stroke of business\\" in recruiting \\"without doubt one of the finest goalkeepers in the district\\". He went straight into the team for the Second Division visit to Albion Rovers on 16 September, and missed only one match between then and the end of the season. He did not re-sign for the new season, because he intended to go to America to play football, but before he left in October, he appeared for Vale of Atholl in the Qualifying Cup. While in America he was reported to have played for a variety of clubs, including Paterson Rangers, IRT Strollers, for whom he appeared on the losing side in the (New York) Metropolitan League Cup, and New York Celtic. He was selected in goal for the New York State Amateur League representative eleven to face the National Association Football League on New Year's Day 1914; his team lost 3‚Äì1. In June of that year, he returned to Scotland on the SS California. The liner ran aground off the coast of Ireland with more than a thousand passengers aboard, all of whom had to be transferred to other vessels to complete their crossing. Bob Crumley had captained Central League club Arbroath in the 1913‚Äì14 season, but when his work restricted his availability, he recommended the club try his brother instead. Crumley \\"worthily upheld his reputation\\", appearing in 31 of the 32 matches played in all competitions. During the First World War, Crumley played for his regimental team, and for English clubs Nottingham Forest and Swindon Town, when his military duties allowed. =Post-war career= Dundee Hibs had retained his registration ever since he left the club in 1912, and he resumed playing for them in March 1919. He signed on again for the 1919‚Äì20 Eastern League season, and his performances attracted attention from clubs outside Scotland. On 20 December 1919, he signed for Swansea Town, then a Southern League club, for a fee reported to be over ¬£200. Crumley himself received a share of the fee as well as wages of ¬£6 a week, and the Dundee People's Journal wished him well: \\"A cheery personality in the pavilion and out of it, James Crumley deserves the best, for he's a tip-top player, and a 'sport' in victory and defeat alike.\\" He went straight into the first team for the Christmas fixtures against Bristol Rovers; although Swansea conceded three goals in the away match, the Cambrian Daily Leader stated that \\"one could not improve on Crumley as a goalie.\\" The following March, he was selected to keep goal for a Southern League Welsh XI against their English counterparts. Swansea were elected to the Football League in 1920, when a new Third Division was formed from the majority of the previous season's Southern League First Division clubs. Crumley played early in the season, but did not keep his place. A year later, the Sunday Post suggested he had \\"improved wonderfully since the opening of last season\\", but although he remained with Swansea until 1923, he played mainly for the reserve team. Crumley joined Bristol City, newly promoted to the Second Division for 1923‚Äì24, as a backup to Frank Vallis. By 13 October, with Bristol City already bottom of the table and both Vallis and Robert Goddard already tried in goal, Crumley made his debut in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Southampton. According to the Western Daily Press, he had nothing to do, so \\"we [had] yet to learn ... how good he is when asked to meet League requirements\\". He kept his place for the next match, a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Fulham, in which he exhibited a tendency to rush off his line when he should not, but that was his last appearance in the League side. =Later career= When Andy Greig was released by Third Division North club Darlington in June 1924 for financial reasons, Crumley signed as his replacement; his brother had kept goal for the club when they played in the North-Eastern League before the war. Crumley was ever-present as Darlington won the division and consequent promotion to the Second Division. Although the record-breaking goalscoring of Davie Brown attracted most attention, Crumley's contribution to his club's success was generally appreciated. A profile in the Derby Daily Telegraph at the start of the new season described him as \\"not as tall as some goalkeepers, but his sense of anticipation is highly developed, while his judgment is good, hands safe, and his clearances pronounced.\\" Performances such as that in a draw with Chelsea in October 1925, when \\"practically every report of the match, in which two goals were divided, declared Crumley as one of the best on the field\\", led to speculation about his possible selection for the Scotland national team, yet two weeks after the Chelsea match, after 55 consecutive first-team appearances, he was dropped to the reserves in favour of John Maughan. The two shared goalkeeping duties for the remainder of the season, Crumley making 24 league appearances. He was not included on Darlington's retained list, and signed for Third Division South club Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. Crumley began his Bournemouth career as reserve, but was in the first team by mid-September. According to the Daily Express, it was due to Crumley's \\"heroic efforts\\" that Coventry City's score was restricted to six, but in October, he scored an own goal in a draw with Merthyr Town and then fumbled a cross to gift Exeter City a goal. He and Jock Robson each made 42 appearances in league matches over their first two seasons,Joyce, Football League Players' Records. p. 25. after which Crumley was retained for 1928‚Äì29 but used mainly as backup for Peter McSevich. Crumley retired at the end of that season, having made 147 appearances over a nine-year career in the English Football League.
