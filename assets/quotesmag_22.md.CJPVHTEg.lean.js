Service A reproduction of a recruitment poster for the regiment on display at the left =Foundation= The 12th New Jersey Infantry Regiment was organized at Camp Stockton in Woodbury, New Jersey, in the summer of 1862 in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for an additional 300,000 men for the Union Army. After training through the summer, it was officially mustered into the Union Army on September 4, 1862. =Early service= The regiment's first assignment was guard duty in Ellicott Mills, Maryland. It first went on duty there on September 8, and remained until December 10. It then moved to Washington, D.C. where it joined the II Corps of the Army of the Potomac. It then moved with the corps to Falmouth, Virginia, reporting there on December 20 and remaining encamped there for the winter. This posting lasted until April 27, 1863, when it led the corps's crossing of the Rappahannock River just prior to the Battle of Chancellorsville. In the course of that battle, it engaged Confederate forces east of the town of Chancellorsville on the morning of May 1. The next day, the regiment joined with the rest of II Corps in forming a defensive line. On May 3, the regiment fell back to protect the corps's artillery units and sustained heavy fire. After the conclusion of the battle, it was ordered back to Falmouth and remained there until the beginning of the Gettysburg Campaign in July. =Gettysburg Campaign= A bas relief carving depicting the regiment's assault on the Bliss Barn. After Confederate cavalry was reported near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, the regiment was ordered north to help screen Washington, D.C. It then moved toward Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, arriving early on July 2. Soon afterward, Company I of the regiment was sent to the skirmish line, but full combat had not yet begun and it sustained only minimal casualties. Throughout that day, intense fighting raged around a farm owned by William Bliss. By the mid-afternoon, the Union held the barn and the Confederacy held the house. The 1st Delaware regiment and Company I of the 12th New Jersey relieved the New York troops holding the area and moved past the farm to a fence near the house. At approximately 4 p.m., the regiment's Captain Henry Chew observed that Confederate General Carnot Posey was gradually bringing in reinforcements so that he could build a force sufficient to dislodge the Union forces holding the barn without drawing attention to it. He reported this to the 1st Delaware's Lieutenant Colonel Edward Harris, but his warning was rebuffed and ignored. His report was, however, accurate: Posey had gathered nearly 700 men, which proceeded to attack and force the Union forces into retreat. At 5 p.m that day, Union general Alexander Hays ordered the barn retaken.Alexander Hays and the Blue Birds by Karlton D. Smith p. 176 Companies B, E, H, and G of the 12th New Jersey, under the command of Captain Samuel Jobes, were chosen for the task. They were fired upon by both sharpshooters in the Bliss buildings and artillery batteries on the nearby Seminary Ridge and sustained heavy casualties. However, they were able to reach the farmyard and, upon so doing, fired a volley of buck and ball into the barn. They then surrounded and seized control of it, capturing about 50 of the sharpshooters within. However, the Confederacy retained control of the house and had sharpshooters there that continued to harry Union troops. General Hays ordered that the soldiers in the barn capture the house. A company of the 12th New Jersey proceeded to do so, capturing more enemy troops. In total, the regiment captured 92 men, including seven officers. The farm was held overnight and through the next morning, until the regiment burned it prior to rejoining the II Corps lines at the commencement of Pickett's Charge. =After Gettysburg= After the end of the Battle of Gettysburg and the subsequent pursuit of the Confederate Army, the regiment was assigned to duty on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. This lasted until September 12, when it was part of an advance from the Rapidan to the Rappahannock River. The regiment then participated in the Bristoe and Mine Run campaigns, the latter ending on December 2. Afterward, the regiment encamped for the winter at Stevensburg, Virginia, until May 3, 1864. After wintering, the regiment was a part of the newly promoted Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's southern attack in the Battle of the Wilderness. Although the regiment was not fully engaged during this battle, it took serious casualties, with one officer killed and several others wounded. It then participated in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, where it suffered similarly. Lieutenant Colonel Davis, one of the wounded from the Wilderness, led the regiment in this battle and was killed. Command was assumed by Captain McCoomb, who was subsequently killed during the Battle of Cold Harbor. Moving on with Grant's southern push, the regiment was a part of the Siege of Petersburg from June 16 to April 2, 1865. Soon afterward, it was present at Battle of Appomattox Court House and Robert E. Lee's surrender to Grant. After the surrender, the regiment marched to Washington, D.C., and served duty there until it officially mustered out on July 15. Over the course of the war, 9 of the regiment's officers and 168 of its enlisted men were killed or suffered mortal wounds, and 99 enlisted men died from disease. Monument In 1886, a monument to the regiment was dedicated at Gettysburg National Military Park. The monument is located on North Hancock Avenue, near the site of the regiment's fighting at Gettysburg.

Refineries are very large industrial complexes that involve many different processing units and auxiliary facilities such as utility units and storage tanks. Each refinery has its own unique arrangement and combination of refining processes largely determined by the refinery location, desired products and economic considerations. Some modern petroleum refineries process as much as 800,000 to 900,000 barrels (127,000 to 143,000 cubic meters) per day of crude oil. History Crude oil was distilled by Persian chemists, with clear descriptions given in Islam handbooks such as those of Muhammad ibn Zakarƒ´ya RƒÅzi (854‚Äì925). The streets of Baghdad were paved with tar, derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region. In the 9th century, oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku, Azerbaijan. These fields were described by the Islam geographer Abu al-Hasan 'Alƒ´ al- Mas'≈´dƒ´ in the 10th century, and by Marco Polo in the 13th century, who described the output of those wells as hundreds of shiploads. Arab and Persian chemists also distilled crude oil in order to produce flammable products for military purposes. Prior to the nineteenth century, petroleum was known and utilized in various fashions in Babylon, Egypt, China, Philippines, Rome and along the Caspian Sea. The modern history of the petroleum industry is said to have begun in 1846 when Abraham Gessner of Nova Scotia, Canada devised a process to produce kerosene from coal. Shortly thereafter, in 1854, Ignacy Lukasiewicz began producing kerosene from hand-dug oil wells near the town of Krosno, Poland. The first large petroleum refinery was built in Ploesti, Romania in 1856 using the abundant oil available in Romania.150 Years of Oil in Romania WORLD EVENTS: 1844‚Äì1856 www.pbs.org In North America, the first oil well was drilled in 1858 by James Miller Williams in Ontario, Canada. In the United States, the petroleum industry began in 1859 when Edwin Drake found oil near Titusville, Pennsylvania. The industry grew slowly in the 1800s, primarily producing kerosene for oil lamps. In the early twentieth century, the introduction of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles created a market for gasoline that was the impetus for fairly rapid growth of the petroleum industry. The early finds of petroleum like those in Ontario and Pennsylvania were soon outstripped by large oil \\"booms\\" in Oklahoma, Texas and California. Prior to World War II in the early 1940s, most petroleum refineries in the United States consisted simply of crude oil distillation units (often referred to as atmospheric crude oil distillation units). Some refineries also had vacuum distillation units as well as thermal cracking units such as visbreakers (viscosity breakers, units to lower the viscosity of the oil). All of the many other refining processes discussed below were developed during the war or within a few years after the war. They became commercially available within 5 to 10 years after the war ended and the worldwide petroleum industry experienced very rapid growth. The driving force for that growth in technology and in the number and size of refineries worldwide was the growing demand for automotive gasoline and aircraft fuel. In the United States, for various complex economic and political reasons, the construction of new refineries came to a virtual stop in about the 1980s. However, many of the existing refineries in the United States have revamped many of their units and/or constructed add-on units in order to: increase their crude oil processing capacity, increase the octane rating of their product gasoline, lower the sulfur content of their diesel fuel and home heating fuels to comply with environmental regulations and comply with environmental air pollution and water pollution requirements. Processing units used in refineries * Crude Oil Distillation unit: Distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions for further processing in other units. * Vacuum distillation unit: Further distills the residue oil from the bottom of the crude oil distillation unit. The vacuum distillation is performed at a pressure well below atmospheric pressure. * Naphtha hydrotreater unit: Uses hydrogen to desulfurize the naphtha fraction from the crude oil distillation or other units within the refinery. * Catalytic reforming unit: Converts the desulfurized naphtha molecules into higher-octane molecules to produce reformate, which is a component of the end-product gasoline or petrol. * Alkylation unit: Converts isobutane and butylenes into alkylate, which is a very high-octane component of the end-product gasoline or petrol. * Isomerization unit: Converts linear molecules such as normal pentane into higher-octane branched molecules for blending into the end-product gasoline. Also used to convert linear normal butane into isobutane for use in the alkylation unit. * Distillate hydrotreater unit: Uses hydrogen to desulfurize some of the other distilled fractions from the crude oil distillation unit (such as diesel oil). * Merox (mercaptan oxidizer) or similar units: Desulfurize LPG, kerosene or jet fuel by oxidizing undesired mercaptans to organic disulfides. * Amine gas treater, Claus unit, and tail gas treatment for converting hydrogen sulfide gas from the hydrotreaters into end-product elemental sulfur. The large majority of the 64,000,000 metric tons of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from petroleum refining and natural gas processing plants.Sulphur production report by the United States Geological SurveyDiscussion of recovered by-product sulphur * Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit: Upgrades the heavier, higher-boiling fractions from the crude oil distillation by converting them into lighter and lower boiling, more valuable products. * Hydrocracker unit: Uses hydrogen to upgrade heavier fractions from the crude oil distillation and the vacuum distillation units into lighter, more valuable products. * Visbreaker unit upgrades heavy residual oils from the vacuum distillation unit by thermally cracking them into lighter, more valuable reduced viscosity products. * Delayed coking and fluid coker units: Convert very heavy residual oils into end-product petroleum coke as well as naphtha and petrol oil by-products. Auxiliary facilities required in refineries * Steam reforming unit: Converts natural gas into hydrogen for the hydrotreaters and/or the hydrocracker. * Sour water stripper unit: Uses steam to remove hydrogen sulfide gas from various wastewater streams for subsequent conversion into end-product sulfur in the Claus unit. * Utility units such as cooling towers for furnishing circulating cooling water, steam generators, instrument air systems for pneumatically operated control valves and an electrical substation. * Wastewater collection and treating systems consisting of API separators, dissolved air flotation (DAF) units and some type of further treatment (such as an activated sludge biotreater) to make the wastewaters suitable for reuse or for disposal. * Liquified gas (LPG) storage vessels for propane and similar gaseous fuels at a pressure sufficient to maintain them in liquid form. These are usually spherical vessels or bullets (horizontal vessels with rounded ends). * Storage tanks for crude oil and finished products, usually vertical, cylindrical vessels with some sort of vapour emission control and surrounded by an earthen berm to contain liquid spills. The crude oil distillation unit The crude oil distillation unit (CDU) is the first processing unit in virtually all petroleum refineries. The CDU distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions of different boiling ranges, each of which are then processed further in the other refinery processing units. The CDU is often referred to as the atmospheric distillation unit because it operates at slightly above atmospheric pressure. Below is a schematic flow diagram of a typical crude oil distillation unit. The incoming crude oil is preheated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then desalted to remove inorganic salts (primarily sodium chloride). Following the desalter, the crude oil is further heated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then heated in a fuel-fired furnace (fired heater) to a temperature of about 398 ¬∞C and routed into the bottom of the distillation unit. The cooling and condensing of the distillation tower overhead is provided partially by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil and partially by either an air-cooled or water-cooled condenser. Additional heat is removed from the distillation column by a pumparound system as shown in the diagram below. As shown in the flow diagram, the overhead distillate fraction from the distillation column is naphtha. The fractions removed from the side of the distillation column at various points between the column top and bottom are called sidecuts. Each of the sidecuts (i.e., the kerosene, light gas oil and heavy gas oil) is cooled by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil. All of the fractions (i.e., the overhead naphtha, the sidecuts and the bottom residue) are sent to intermediate storage tanks before being processed further.

It is one of only two species of Melaleuca to have two kinds of stamens. (The other is Melaleuca violacea). The outer stamens are longer and curved, giving the appearance of a claw to the flower. It is a hardy shrub flowering over a long period and has been a popular garden plant for many years.Esperance fruit Description Melaleuca pulchella is a spreading shrub which may grow to high. The numerous arching branches bear many small leaves which are ovate to elliptic in shape and measure in length by wide. The leaves are crescent moon shaped in cross section and the undersides have large oil glands. Appearing from September to February, sometimes in April or May, the flowers are pink to mauve in colour. They occur singly or in groups of up to four, forming small heads up to in diameter, mostly at or near the ends of the branches. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. There are five bundles of stamens around the flower, each with 45-100 stamens. Each bundle contains about 45 to 80 short, (sterile) stamens and 10 to 15 long, curved, outer stamens. Flowering is followed by fruit which are woody, urn- shaped capsules, long and about in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca pulchella was first formally described in 1812 by Robert Brown , the description published by William Aiton in Hortus Kewensis. The specific epithet (pulchella) is the Latin adjective pulchellus meaning \\"very pretty\\" (diminutive of pulcher), referring to the flowers of this species. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca sapientes occurs along Western Australia's south coast, from Hopetoun to Israelite Bay in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy soils on plains, dunes and swamps. Conservation Melaleuca pulchella is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Melaleuca pulchella's small size, long flowering period and widely admired flowers make it a popular plant for gardens. It prefers fair drainage and extra water but is adaptable to most garden situations. Unlike many Australian native plants, it is relatively tolerant of phosphates to some degree in cultivation.

It aired on November 8, 2010.  Plot  Ted and the gang are invited to a gala party at the Natural History Museum thrown by George van Smoot, also known as \\"The Captain\\". While hobnobbing, Ted sees Zoey, with whom he is angry for writing a column criticizing his work at GNB regarding the Arcadian, describing the project as \\"taking away from the have-nots, giving to the haves\\". At the party, Zoey introduces Ted to her husband, the Captain (Kyle MacLachlan), a wealthy, much older man who is obsessed with boats. Later, Ted corners Zoey and berates her for the hypocrisy of her column and trying to ruin his career, angrily calling her a \\"bored trophy wife\\". At this, Zoey starts crying and tells Ted that she is unhappy in her marriage. Ted immediately feels sorry for her, and he tries to commiserate with her by ranting against GNB and their obnoxious work culture. However, Zoey's tears are a ruse: she had been recording the entire conversation, and then vows to leak it into the next day's newspaper. The Captain hears about the situation and sympathises with Ted, because he had also fallen victim of Zoey's recorder; Ted replies that even though she betrayed his trust, he respects her activism. The Captain promises to erase Ted's recording because he is impressed by him. Because of the acoustic capabilities of the museum, Zoey overhears their conversation; she breaks into real tears and promises Ted she will erase the conversation herself, resolving to play fair from now on. Meanwhile, Barney goes on the prowl in the museum, pulling off pranks using various exhibits along with Robin. Barney brags about having knocked down the blue whale exhibit as a child, which none of the gang believe. After catching Robin by surprise disguised as an Egyptian pharaoh, a security guard catches them in the act and brings them to the security office. Robin's skepticism about the blue whale incident prompts the security officer to check old records. One file, dated July 23, 1981, recounts the incident in full, but a check of the document reveals that Barney's guardian that day, Jerome Whittaker‚Äîwho he believed as a child to be his \\"Uncle Jerry\\"‚Äîidentified himself as Barney's father on the visitor form. Barney then reveals to Robin that his mother forbade them further contact soon after this incident. He asks Robin not to mention the discovery to the others. Marshall tells Lily that GNB has offered him a five-year contract. Lily, however, is still firm on her belief that Marshall will resign and pursue his dream of being an environmental lawyer. In the ensuing argument, Marshall insists on staying in the company for financial reasons, and Lily storms out; she feels he has not stayed true to himself and their values. While in another part of the museum, Lily visualizes an exhibit showing extinct \\"College Marshall\\" at their old Wesleyan dorm. She talks with College Marshall, telling him that his persona was the one she fell in love with many years ago and \\"Corporate\\" Marshall embodied everything he despised. However, College Marshall tells her that while Corporate Marshall may have changed in a few ways, he has not changed where it counts. Just then, the real Marshall appears and promises to work hard to provide a stable future for their family. Future Ted later reveals that Marshall will leave GNB in the future, with the camera pulling back to reveal an exhibit showing extinct Corporate Marshall.  Critical response  Reviews of the episode have been positive. Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ score, saying the episode tackled people's thoughts about their past and how they should let things go, which were explained well during the third part.

'Kerja' in this sense is a Karo word meaning 'party', and not the Indonesian 'kerja', which means work.‚ÄúKerja Tahun‚Äù Tradisi pada Masyarakat Karo - Junita Ginting  History  Rice-planting has historically held great importance for the Karo people, rice being the staple food of the region, as well as an important source of income and indicator of wealth, in the size of one's rice barn. The Karo traditionally planted rice once per year, using dry rice (in Indonesian 'ladang') cultivation. Rice cultivation has an important role in the traditional Karo religion (known as pemenahttp://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/1987/11/21/AG/mbm.19871121.AG32818.id.html).  Festival  In order to ensure the success of the rice-planting, the Merdang Merdem festival is conducted, paying homage to Beru Dayang, a female spirit also associated with childbirth, a process with which the rice planting is analogised by the Karo.https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001523302 The kerja tahun festival does not have a fixed date in the Karoland, but varies by village. Despite the decline in traditional beliefs, as well as the decline in the number of people growing rice (due to modernisation and the switch to other crops), the kerja tahun festival is still widely held, but now as an activity with greater significance in terms of kinship and cultural bonds than as a religious practice. = Festival specifics = The festival lasts six days, with a seventh day of rest:http://repository.usu.ac.id/bitstream/123456789/18047/3/Chapter%20III- IV.pdf * Cikor-kor - the participants search for 'kor-kor', a specific insect found in the soil under trees. These are eaten. * Cikurung - the participants search for 'kurung', animals of the rice fields. These are also eaten. * Ndurung - the participants search for 'nurung', fish of the rice fields or river (no specific species of fish, just whatever happens to be found). These too are eaten. * Mantem - 'slaughter' - livestock such as pigs, buffalo, and cows are slaughtered. Terites is cooked. * Matana - the main day of celebration. Following four days of feasting, matana is the day for music and dancing. Gendang Guro-guro Aron music is performed, and the perkolong-kolong sing. The perkolong-kolong are skilled male and female singers who perform Karonese music facing each other, often making jokes in between songs.

After completion was sent to the China station where she was deployed on the Yangtse River to relieve the Insect-class gunboat, . She remained there until the declaration of war by the Empire of Japan in December 1941. She was subsequently transferred to Singapore Naval Base and participated in the Malayan Campaign in early 1942. Near the end of the Battle of Singapore, she evacuated the base on 11 February together with her sister ship . Three days later she was attacked and sunk by Japanese aircraft off the island of Sebayer. Most of the ship's survivors were later captured on Sumatra by Japanese troops. Design and description The design of the Dragonfly-class ships was based on that of the earlier with that ship's flagship accommodations replaced by a low-angle director-control tower. Grasshopper displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers. Grasshopper carried a maximum of of fuel oil.Lenton (1998), p. 270 The ship mounted two quick-firing (QF) guns 4-inch Mk V guns in single mounts, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. These guns had a maximum elevation of +30 degrees. She also carried a single QF 3.7-inch howitzer.Gardiner & Gray (1985), p. 79 For anti-aircraft defence, Grasshopper had eight single mounts for anti-aircraft machine guns. She had a crew of 74 officers and enlisted men. Service The ship was ordered on 9 August 1937 as one of the intended replacements for the existing river gunboats stationed on the Chinese rivers. Grasshopper was laid down on 29 December 1937 by John I. Thornycroft & Company at Woolston, Southampton, and launched on 19 January 1939. In April 1939 she sailed to the China Station under her own power and was expected to arrive on 24 May. Grasshopper was commissioned on 1 June 1939 in Hong Kong and completed on 13 June. She was deployed to the Yangtse River where she replaced the HMS Gnat later that month. Part of Gnat crew transferred to Grasshopper, including the ship's mascot, a dog called Judy. Following Japan's entry into the Second World War in December 1941, she was transferred from China to Singapore.Varley (1973): p. 43 During January 1942, Grasshopper supported retreating Allied troops during the Malayan Campaign.Varley (1973): p. 48 Starting on 27 January, Grasshopper and Dragonfly rescued almost 3,000 soldiers from the British 53rd Infantry and 15th Indian Infantry Brigades from the swamps south of Batu Pahat after they had been cut off by the advancing Japanese forces.Shores, Cull & Izawa (1992), p. 347 After the Japanese captured the Malayan Peninsula, both ships moved to Singapore harbour. On 8 February, the Japanese launched an amphibious assault across the Strait of Johore and following heavy fighting, many ships began evacuating from the harbour. By 11 February Gnat and Grasshopper were the largest vessels left.Varley (1973): p. 51 The two ships left Singapore for Batavia at 21:00 on 13 February, having taken on other personnel to evacuate them. Amongst these was Commander Ian Forbes, formerly of the battleship , which had been sunk by the Japanese just over two months earlier. By the following morning they could hear the attacks by Japanese aircraft on other vessels in the distance.Varley (1973): p. 54 As they were sailing south, they were attacked by Japanese bombers. During the initial pass, Grasshopper was hit by a single bomb.Varley (1973): p. 57 When the planes returned, Dragonfly was hit three times and sank quickly. Grasshopper was hit twice and was set on fire. The order to abandon ship was given as the fire spread to compartments adjacent to an ammunition store.Varley (1973): p. 58 Judy, the ship's dog, later became a Japanese prisoner of war and was awarded the Dicken Medal for bravery. The crew were ferried across to the nearby island of Sebayer by the ship's boats while the Japanese aircraft strafed them, where they joined some survivors from the Dragonfly. However the ship did not sink initially and after the planes departed, several crewmen were sent back on board to scavenge supplies.Varley (1973): p. 60 Among the survivors were six captured Japanese airmen and two pregnant women who had their babies delivered by the ship's coxswain. Both boys were named after him by their mothers.Shores, Cull & Izawa (1993), p. 83 Whilst on board, Petty Officer George White found Judy, who would later find a source of fresh water for the crew on the island.Varley (1973): p. 61 On 19 February, the remaining crew managed to commandeer a Chinese tongkang and using that and the ship's boat,Varley (1973): p. 64 they reached Singkep in the Dutch East Indies.

New England sent an overwhelming force to conquer Acadia by capturing the capital Port Royal, Chedabucto, and attacking other villages. The aftermath of these battles was unlike any of the previous military campaigns against Acadia. The violence of the attacks alienated many of the Acadians from the New Englanders, broke their trust, and made it difficult for them to deal amicably with the English-speakers.Geoffrey Plank. An Unsettled Conquest: The British Campaign Against the Peoples of Acadia. University of Pennsylvania Press. 2001. p. 32 Historical context Clerbaud Bergier led other merchants from La Rochelle, France in enjoying a fishing monopoly in Acadia. In 1682, Fort St. Louis was established by the Company of Acadia (Compagnie de la Peche Sedentaire) to protect the fishery. The principal port was at Chedabucto Bay, which accounted for fifty fishers in 1686. Dauphin de Montorgueil was the commandant at Fort Saint-Louis. Bergier's monopoly was contested by other Acadian merchants, among them Acadian governor Michel Leneuf de la Valli√®re de Beaubassin, who had been selling fishing licenses to New Englanders. There were various intentions behind the New England attack on Acadia. Some wanted the expedition to lay the foundation for a profitable postwar relations with the Mi'kmaq and Acadians, while others sought only to punish them for their alleged complicity in recent attacks against New England.Geoffrey Plank. An Unsettled Conquest: The British Campaign Against the Peoples of Acadia. University of Pennsylvania Press. 2001. p. 11  Battle  As part of Sir William Phips' expedition to capture the capital of Acadia Port Royal, Phips sent Captain Cyprian Southack to Chedabacto with 80 men to destroy Fort Saint-Louis and the surrounding French fishery. Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Meneval was stationed at the fort with 12 soldiers. The soldiers at Fort Saint-Louis, unlike those at Port Royal, put up a fight before surrendering. They tried to defend the fort for over six hours, until fire bombs burned the fort to the ground. Southack destroyed the enormous amount of 50,000 crowns of fish. The garrison capitulated on honorable terms and were sent to the French capital of Newfoundland, Plaisance.See an account of the battle in Joseph Robineau de Villebon, Journal of Villebon, 3 October 1692, in Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century: Letters, Journals and Memoirs of Joseph Robineau de Villebon, by John Clarence Webster (St. John, N.B.: The New Brunswick Museum, 1934) Villebon's Journal, Consequences Phips also dispatched Capt. John Alden (sailor) who raided Cape Sable (present-day south-west Nova Scotia) as well as the villages around the Bay of Fundy, particularly Grand Pre and Chignecto. France regained control of Port Royal the following year. Joseph Robineau de Villebon, one of Meneval's assistants, returned to Port Royal from France. He reestablished French authority in Port Royal. The Company of Acadia encountered a variety of difficulties on the way to its final dissolution in 1702. Fort Saint-Louis remained in use at Chedabucto until the community was destroyed in the Squirrel Affair (1718).Haynes, p. 25  See also  * Military history of Nova Scotia References Sources  *Haynes, Mark.

The winery is located in the Adelaida district west of Paso Robles in the Santa Lucia Mountains, within the Paso Robles AVA. It is an exemplar of the GSM blend (Southern Rh√¥ne), and has been influential in popularizing it in California.Wine Folly, Time to Try ‚ÄòGSM‚Äô The C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Blend, Madeline Puckette, December 4, 2013 History Tablas Creek Vineyard plantings Described as the sibling winery of southern Rh√¥ne estate Ch√¢teau de Beaucastel in Ch√¢teauneuf du Pape,Asimov, Eric, The New York Times (November 1, 2010). A Sturdy Red for WinterMcInerney, Jay, Wall Street Journal (June 19, 2010). Blending New World and Old Tablas Creek Vineyard was founded in 1990 by Jean-Pierre and Fran√ßois Perrin of the Perrin family, proprietors of Beaucastel since the early 20th century, and Robert Haas, an importer and the founder of Vineyard Brands. Having searched for the appropriate terroir since 1985, in 1989 the Perrins and Haas chose the site, a former alfalfa farm on top of a Late Cretaceous seabed, for its soil pH and limestone base similarities to Beaucastel.Perrotti-Brown, Lisa, erobertparker.com (October 2009). Pierre Perrin: Taking it to Tablas CreekYarrow, Alder, vinography.com (January 27, 2008). Tablas Creek Vineyard, Paso Robles: Current Releases Tablas Creek Vineyard view With an aim to produce Rh√¥ne-style wines made by organic principles, vines were imported from the Beaucastel vineyards, both to supply varieties previously unavailable in California such as Counoise and Grenache blanc, and in order to ensure the disease-free provenance of the remaining varieties. Beginning in 1990, the vines were quarantined by the United States Department of Agriculture. The first clones were released in 1992, with additional clones released over the next two decades. Planting of these French clones began in 1994. Previously, experiments had been made with American material planted in selected soils beginning in 1992. Wines were produced under the names Adelaida Hills and Tablas Hills between 1994 and 1996, with the first Tablas Creek Vineyard wines produced in 1997. Although all grapes were grown on site, the launch of the Tablas Creek Vineyard label was delayed until the majority of the wine was produced from French vines. Pierre Perrin estimates that the Tablas Creek estate with its nursery project has \\"probably been one of the most expensive vineyards in the world to develop\\". In 2009 it was reported that 50% of the sales of the Tablas Creek production takes place at the estate or through their wine club. Production Esprit de Beaucastel The Tablas Creek estate extends , with approximately under vine, situated at an average elevation of . The estate annually produces ca. of wine. *;Esprit de Beaucastel The signature wines of Tablas Creek are the red Esprit de Beaucastel and white Esprit de Beaucastel Blanc made with an objective for aging. Esprit de Beaucastel is largely based on Mourv√®dre, with additions of Grenache, Syrah and Counoise. Esprit de Beaucastel Blanc is based on Roussanne with additions of Grenache blanc and Picpoul blanc. *;C√¥tes de Tablas The C√¥tes de Tablas wines are produced to be consumed young. The red C√¥tes de Tablas is a blend of four grape varieties Grenache, Syrah, Counoise and Mourv√®dre. The white C√¥tes de Tablas Blanc is a blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne and Grenache blanc. *;Patelin de Tablas The Patelin de Tablas wines debuted with the 2010 vintage, and include some Tablas Creek fruit and fruit purchased from other Paso Robles vineyards. The Patelin de Tablas red is a blend based on Syrah, with Grenache, Mourvedre and Counoise. It's good with appetizers. The Patelin de Tablas Blanc is a blend of Grenache blanc, Viognier, Roussanne, and Marsanne.

Nursery The grape vine nursery of Tablas Creek Vineyard Since the 1990 program to propagate grape vine clones from the Beaucastel vineyards, followed by the three-year U.S. Department of Agriculture quarantine, the vine nursery was finally established in 1992. Between 1993 and 2003, the estate produced over 1,000,000 vine grafts on site, and the sale of plant cuttings to other wine producers remains a part of Tablas Creek's business, although since 2004 Tablas Creek has contracted with NovaVine Nursery in Santa Rosa, California to produce and market their vine material. The cloned grape varieties cultivated in the nursery available for purchase include classic Rh√¥ne grape varieties ‚Äì Mourv√®dre, Syrah, Grenache, Counoise, Roussanne, Viognier, Grenache blanc, Marsanne, Picpoul blanc ‚Äì as well as Vermentino and Tannat.

The SAM domain that spreads over around 70 residues is found in diverse eukaryotic organisms. SAM domains have been shown to homo- and hetero-oligomerise, forming multiple self-association architectures and also binding to various non-SAM domain-containing proteins, nevertheless with a low affinity constant. SAM domains also appear to possess the ability to bind RNA. Smaug, a protein that helps to establish a morphogen gradient in Drosophila embryos by repressing the translation of nanos (nos) mRNA, binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of nos mRNA via two similar hairpin structures. The 3D crystal structure of the Smaug RNA-binding region shows a cluster of positively charged residues on the Smaug-SAM domain, which could be the RNA-binding surface. This electropositive potential is unique among all previously determined SAM-domain structures and is conserved among Smaug-SAM homologs. These results suggest that the SAM domain might have a primary role in RNA binding. Structural analyses show that the SAM domain is arranged in a small five-helix bundle with two large interfaces. In the case of the SAM domain of EPHB2, each of these interfaces is able to form dimers. The presence of these two distinct intermonomers binding surface suggest that SAM could form extended polymeric structures. Fungal SAM In molecular biology, the protein domain Ste50p mainly in fungi and some other types of eukaryotes. It plays a role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, a type of cell signalling that helps the cell respond to external stimuli, more specifically mating, cell growth, and osmo-tolerance in fungi. =Function= The protein domain Ste50p has a role in detecting pheromones for mating. It is thought to be found bound to Ste11p in order to prolong the pheromone-induced signaling response. Furthermore, it is also involved in aiding the cell to respond to nitrogen starvation. =Structure= The fungal Ste50p SAM consists of six helices, which form a compact, globular fold. It is a monomer in solution and often undergoes heterodimerisation (and in some cases oligomerisation) of the protein. =Protein interaction= The SAM domain of Ste50p often interacts with the SAM domain of Ste11p. They form bonds through this association. It is important to note that the SAM domain of one protein will bind to the SAM of a different protein. SAM domains do not self-associate in vitro. There is significant evidence for Ste50p oligomerization in vivo.

It was formed in the spring of 1937 at a meeting in Mike Cutt's Clay Pipe Inn in Tonawanda, New York. Representatives from Lackawanna, Tonawanda, North Tonawanda, Niagara Falls, Trott, Kenmore and Lockport merged the former RPI basketball and St. Lawrence football leagues to found the NFL. In the early years of the NFL, schedules were balanced by granting associate memberships for either football or basketball to Batavia, Dunkirk, Jamestown, and Olean. The league stabilized its membership in 1939 with the addition of La Salle and the expansion to other sports. In 1959, Kenmore East entered competition and in 1961, the late Harry Blakeslee brought Lewiston-Porter into the fold from the Niagara Orleans League. 1965 saw the withdrawal of charter member Lackawanna to the E.C.I.C. Niagara Wheatfield entered the league at that time, coming from the Niagara Orleans League. The NFL initiated an extensive sports program for the girls in the member schools in 1973 and it has flourished since. Grand Island left the E.C.I.C. and moved to the NFL in 1979 and the league welcomed the Nichols School in 1983. Each member school felt the loss of charter member Trott Vocational due to the school closing in 1988. The Engineers, with more than 50 years of competition in the NFL had been a source of pride for the school, the city of Niagara Falls, the league and their alumni. In 1995, charter member Tonawanda High School left for the E.C.I.C. The opening of the new Niagara Falls High School in the fall of 2000 spelled the end of LaSalle High School. LaSalle High School, who entered the Niagara Frontier League in 1939, was consolidated into the new high school. The Nichols School withdrew from the league at the close of the 2002 school year. The NFL welcomed the Charter School for Applied Technologies in 2004. The Charter School for Applied Technologies left the Niagara Frontier League at the conclusion of the 2006-07 season.

It was appended to the end of the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, an account of the reign of Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile, and narrates the victorious military campaign of 1147 that culminated in the conquest of the port of Almer√≠a. The poem, as it survives, is unfinished, abruptly ending mid-line before recounting the actual siege of Almer√≠a itself. Of its surviving lines, 293 consist of \\"d√©nombrement √©pique, a stirring roll-call of the chief members and contingents of the army\\".Barton 2006, 458‚Äì59. The Poem has aroused interest among scholars and critics for the light it may shed on the origins and development of vernacular epic (the cantares de gesta) and on the nature of Iberian aristocratic and military customs. It has been described as \\"a relict of incomparable interest for the cultural archaeology of the twelfth century\\"Salvador Mart√≠nez 1975, 398, quoted in Barton 2006, 459: \\"un resto de la arqueolog√≠a cultural del siglo XII de incomparable inter√©s\\". and \\"a splendid reflection of its time and, in this regard, full of gold also as literature\\".Rico Manrique 1969, 72‚Äì73, quoted in Barton 2006, 459: \\"un espl√©ndid reflejo de su tiempo y, de tal sentido, de hartos quilates tambi√©n como literatura\\".

His first brush with the professional world of music came in 2004 when his high school band was signed by Warner Brothers. Marion was a 2005 Pope John graduate.\\" After opening for Yeasayer at New York City's Governors Island in summer 2010 and a residency at Brooklyn club Union Pool, the band attracted media and record label attention. That year, Delicate Steve signed to Luaka Bop, who released the \\"Butterfly\\" 7\\" single, backed with a cover of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Albatross\\" on the B-side. = Wondervisions (2011) = On January 25, 2011, Delicate Steve's debut album, Wondervisions, was released on Luaka Bop. The entirety of the album was recorded by Marion in his bedroom and quickly gained the attention of critics, becoming a \\"Critics' Choice\\" selection of The New York Times as well as being included on NPR's \\"Favorite Songs of 2011\\". For the release of Wondervisions, author Chuck Klosterman wrote a fictional biography of Delicate Steve. The bio was originally published anonymously and was mostly taken as fact by fans and press, but was exposed in a feature news story on NPR's All Things Considered. = Positive Force (2012) = In July 2012, Delicate Steve's sophomore record, Positive Force, was released on Luaka Bop. The album quickly received high praise, including an 84 from Filter, an 8.5 from Paste, a 7.6 in Pitchfork and a 7 from Spin. For promotion of Positive Force, a legitimate biography of the band was written by Michael Azerrad, author of Our Band Could Be Your Life. On September 3, 2014, the band issued a free digital sampler EP, titled Multiple Moods Sampler, via Bandcamp. = Live in Las Vegas (2015) = Following the release of Positive Force, the band toured with Tame Impala, Mac DeMarco, Dirty Projectors, Tune-Yards and Yeasayer. While supporting Tame Impala on their US tour, a live album was recorded at a November 13, 2014 show at the Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas. Live in Las Vegas was released on March 3, 2015. = This Is Steve (2017) = In 2016, Delicate Steve signed to Anti- and toured with Cass McCombs.

Biography  Aleksandr was the son of , a colleague of Nikolai Lobachevsky. The subject of hyperbolic geometry was non-Euclidean geometry, a departure from tradition. The early exposure to Lobachevsky's work eventually led to Aleksandr undertaking the job of editing Lobachevsky's works. Kotelnikov studied at Kazan University, graduating in 1884. He began teaching at a gymnasium. Having an interest in mechanics, he did graduate study. His thesis was The Cross-Product Calculus and Certain of its Applications in Geometry and Mechanics. His work contributed to the development of screw theory and kinematics.Wilhelm Blaschke (1960) Kinematics and Quaternions, page 47, translated by D. H. Delphenich Kotelnikov began instructing at the university in 1893. His habilitation thesis was The Projective Theory of Vectors (1899). In Kiev, Kotelnikov was professor and head of the department of pure mathematics until 1904. Returning to Kazan, he headed the mathematics department until 1914. He was at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute directing the department of Theoretical Mechanics until 1924, when he moved to Moscow and took up teaching at Bauman Technical University. In addition to the Works of Lobachevsky, Kotelnikov was also the editor of the collected works of Nikolai Zhukovsky, the father of Russian aerodynamics. One reviewer put Kotelnikov at the head of a chain of investigations of Spaces over Algebras.A.P. Shirokov (2002) \\"Spaces over algebras and their applications\\", Journal of Mathematical Sciences 108(2): 232‚Äì48 Successive researchers included D.N. Zeiliger, A.P. Norden, and B. A. Rosenfel‚Äôd. Dual quaternions Kotelnikov advanced an algebraic method of representing Euclidean motions that had been introduced by W. K. Clifford. Though developed to render motions in three-dimensional space, an eight-dimensional algebra of doubled quaternions ‚Ñç was used. Clifford had shown that a space of rotations entailed elliptic space described by versors in his four-dimensional quaternions. According to Wilhelm Blaschke it was Kotelnikov who initiated a \\"conversion principle\\" to take a dual rotation acting on elliptic space to a motion of ‚Ñù3, three-dimensional Euclidean space: If r is one of the square roots of minus one in ‚Ñç, then an underline (\\\\underline{r}) represents the elliptic line in the plane perpendicular to r (Blaschke: the united elliptic line). Using the inner product on ‚Ñç formed by taking the product of a quaternion with its conjugate, the condition :<\\\\underline{r},\\\\ \\\\underline{s}>\\\\ = \\\\ 0 is equivalent to :\\\\ =\\\\ 0 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{and}\\\\ \\\\+ \\\\ =\\\\ 0, and implies that elliptic lines \\\\underline{r} \\\\ \\\\text{and}\\\\ \\\\underline{s} are perpendicular. Under these conditions, the Kotelnikov conversion to Euclidean motion is represented as :q \\\\ = \\\\ Q^* p Q \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{where}\\\\ \\\\ Q \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\cos (\\\\underline{\\\\omega} ) + \\\\underline{u}\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\underline{\\\\omega}) and where \\\\underline{u} is the screw axis.Wilhelm Blaschke (1958) \\"Anwendung dualer Quaternionen auf Kinematik\\", Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae (1958), 1-13; Gesammelte Werke, volume 2, Applications of dual quaternions to kinematics, translation by D.

Marie Regina Siegling (February 7, 1824 ‚Äì January 2, 1920) was an American composer. She was born in Charleston, South Carolina, the eldest daughter of Prussian immigrant Johann Zacharias Siegling and his wife Mary Schnierle. Johann Siegling was an instrument maker and music publisher who founded the Siegling Music House in 1819. Marie Siegling most likely began her musical studies under her mother. Siegling was later educated in Europe and had a career as a musician and composer. In 1844 she traveled with her father to Havana where he had a music store called Siegling & Vallote. They stayed in Cuba for three months, where she performed as \\"Charleston's Jenny Lind.\\" Later in the year, Siegling went to Paris to study music. While on tour in Europe, she met literature professor Eduard Schuman LeClercq, whom she married in 1850. Siegling moved with her husband to Paris and ended her performing career. She had five children. While in Europe, Marie had contact with many of its greatest composers and musicians. She writes in her memoir: \\"I met many distinguished artists and authors, amongst them Wagner , Schroeder, Devrient, Liszt, Schumann. Here also I was present at the first representation of Tannh√§user and Lohengrin, directed by the great Master Richard Wagner, who took the baton.\\" Her own composition, Souvernir de la Saxe, is dedicated to Her Majesty, Marie, Reine de Saxe.

Overview  The QP family consists of QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano frameworks, which are all quality controlled, documented, and commercially licensable. All QP frameworks can run on \\"bare-metal\\" single-chip microcontrollers, completely replacing a traditional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Ports and ready-to- use examples are provided for all major CPU families. QP/C and QP/C++ can also work with a traditional OS/RTOS, such as: POSIX (Linux, QNX), Windows, VxWorks, ThreadX, MicroC/OS, FreeRTOS, etc. The behavior of active objects (actors) is specified in QP by means of hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts). The frameworks support manual coding of UML state machines in C or C++ as well as fully automatic code generation by means of the free graphical QM modeling tool. The QP frameworks and the QM modeling tool are used in medical devices, defense & aerospace, robotics, consumer electronics, wired and wireless telecommunication, industrial automation, transportation, and many more.  Background  Active objects inherently support and automatically enforce the following best practices of concurrent programming: * Keep all of the task's data local, bound to the task itself and hidden from the rest of the system. * Communicate among tasks asynchronously via intermediary event objects. Using asynchronous event posting keeps the tasks running truly independently without blocking on each other. * Tasks should spend their lifetime responding to incoming events, so their mainline should consist of an event loop. * Tasks should process events one at a time (to completion), thus avoiding any concurrency hazards within a task itself. Active objects dramatically improve your ability to reason about the concurrent software. In contrast, using raw RTOS tasks directly is trouble for a number of reasons, particularly because raw tasks let you do anything and offer you no help or automation for the best practices. As with all good patterns, active objects raise the level of abstraction above the naked threads and let you express your intent more directly thus improving your productivity. Active objects cannot operate in a vacuum and require a software infrastructure (framework) that provides, at a minimum: an execution thread for each active object, queuing of events, and event-based timing services. In the resource-constrained embedded systems, the biggest concern has always been about scalability and efficiency of such frameworks, especially that the frameworks accompanying various modeling tools have traditionally been built on top of a conventional RTOS, which adds memory footprint and CPU overhead to the final solution. The QP frameworks have been designed for efficiency and minimal footprint from the ground up and do not need an RTOS in the stand- alone configuration. In fact, when compared to conventional RTOSes, QP frameworks provide smaller footprint especially in RAM (data space), but also in ROM (code space). This is possible, because active objects don't need to block, so most blocking mechanisms (e.g., semaphores) of a conventional RTOS are not needed. All these characteristics make event-driven active objects a perfect fit for single-chip microcontrollers (MCUs). Not only do you get the productivity boost by working at a higher level of abstraction than raw RTOS tasks, but you get it at a lower resource utilization and better power efficiency, because event-driven systems use the CPU only when processing events and otherwise can put the chip in a low-power sleep mode.  QP architecture and components  QP consists of a universal UML-compliant event processor (QEP), a portable, event-driven, real-time framework (QF), a tiny run-to-completion kernel (QK), and software tracing system (QS). QP components QEP (Quantum Event Processor) is a universal UML-compliant event processor that enables direct coding of UML state machines (UML statecharts) in highly maintainable C or C++, in which every state machine element is mapped to code precisely, unambiguously, and exactly once (traceability). QEP fully supports hierarchical state nesting, which enables reusing behavior across many states instead of repeating the same actions and transitions over and over again. QF (Quantum Framework) is a highly portable, event-driven, real-time application framework for concurrent execution of state machines specifically designed for real-time embedded systems. QK (Quantum Kernel) is a tiny preemptive non- blocking run-to-completion kernel designed specifically for executing state machines in a run-to-completion (RTC) fashion. QS (Quantum Spy) is a software tracing system that enables live monitoring of event-driven QP applications with minimal target system resources and without stopping or significantly slowing down the code.  Supported processors  All types of QP frameworks (QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano) can be easily adapted to various microprocessor architectures and compilers. Adapting the QP software is called porting and all QP frameworks have been designed from ground up to make the porting easy. Currently, bare-metal QP ports exist for the following processor architectures: * ARM Cortex-M4F (TI Stellaris) * ARM Cortex-M3 (TI Stellaris, ST STM32, NXP LPC) * ARM Cortex-M0 (NXP LPC1114) * ARM7/9 (Atmel AT91R4x, AT91SAM7, NXP LPC, ST STR912) * Atmel AVR Mega * Atmel AVR32 UC3-A3 * TI MSP430 * TI TMS320C28x * TI TMS320C55x * Renesas Rx600 * Renesas R8C * Renesas H8 * Freescale Coldfire * Freescale 68HC08 * Altera Nios II * 8051 (Silicon Labs) * 80251 (Atmel) * Microchip PIC24/dsPIC * Cypress PSoC1 * 80x86 real mode  Supported operating systems  The QP/C and QP/C++ frameworks can also work with the traditional operating systems and RTOSes. Currently, QP ports exist for the following OSes/RTOSes: * Linux (POSIX) * Win32 (all desktop Windows and WindowsCE) * VxWorks * ThreadX * FreeRTOS * MicroC/OS-II * QNX (POSIX) * Integrity (POSIX)  Licensing  All QP framework types are dual- licensed under the open source GPLv2 and a traditional, closed-source license. Users who want to distribute QP (e.g. embedded inside user upgradable devices) can retain the proprietary status of their code for a fee. Several types of commercial, royalty-free, closed-source licenses are available.

This relationship can be expressed as : E_\\\\text{a} = E_0 + \\\\alpha \\\\Delta H, where : E_\\\\text{a} is the activation energy of a reference reaction of the same class, : \\\\Delta H is the enthalpy of reaction, : \\\\alpha characterizes the position of the transition state along the reaction coordinate (such that 0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha \\\\leq 1). The Evans‚ÄìPolanyi model is a linear energy relationship that serves as an efficient way to calculate activation energy of many reactions within a distinct family. The activation energy may be used to characterize the kinetic rate parameter of a given reaction through application of the Arrhenius equation. The Evans‚ÄìPolanyi model assumes that the pre-exponential factor of the Arrhenius equation and the position of the transition state along the reaction coordinate are the same for all reactions belonging to a particular reaction family. Derivation The Bell‚ÄìEvans‚ÄìPolanyi model was developed independently by Ronald Percy BellBell, R. P., Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A, 1936, 154, 414. and by Meredith Gwynne Evans and Michael PolanyiEvans, M. G.; Polanyi, M., J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans., 1936, 32, 1333. to explain the apparent linear relationship between activation energy and free energy in acid disassociation, as described in the Br√∏nsted catalysis equation, which was the original linear free-energy relationship published in 1924.Br√∏nsted, J. N.; Pedersen, K. J. Zeitschrift f√ºr Phys. Chemie, St√∂chiometrie und Verwandtschaftslehre 1924, 108, 185‚Äì235. Consider the reaction : AB + C \\\\to A + BC. The system is assumed to have two degrees of freedom: rAB, the distance between atoms A and B, and rBC, the distance between atoms B and C. The distance between A and C is assumed to be fixed such that : r = r_\\\\text{AB} = const - r_\\\\text{BC} As the A‚ÄîB bond stretches, the energy of the system increases up to the activation energy associated with the transition state, whereupon the bond breaks. The energy then decreases as the B‚ÄîC bond is formed. Evans and Polanyi approximated the two energy functions between reactants, the transition state, and the products by two straight lines (with slopes m1 and m2 respectively) that intersect at the transition state. For the AB molecule, the energy is given as a function of bond distance r: At the transition state, r = r‚Ä° and E = Ea. Therefore, we can write that which rearranges to give {m_1} + r_1.}} For the BC molecule, a similar expression of energy as a function of r is given by The overall enthalpy change ŒîH of the system can thus be expressed as Plugging equation into equation and rearranging gives the following: The constants in equation can be condensed into the common form of the Evans‚ÄìPolanyi equation given above.

There are six groups of Batak who speak separate but related languages: the Angkola, the Mandailing to the south, the Toba, to the north the Pakpak/Dairi, the Simalungun, and the Karo. While the groups are now Muslim or Christian, elements of the ancient Batak religion remain, particularly amongst the Karo. The bale (\\"meeting hall\\"), rumah (\\"house\\"), and sopo (\\"rice barn\\") are the three main building types common to the different Batak groups. The rumah has traditionally been a large house in which a group of families live communally. During the day, the interior is shared living space, and at night, cloth or matting drapes provide families with privacy. Most Batak now live in modern homes, and many traditional houses are abandoned or in a poor state of repair. The architecture and village layouts of the six Batak groups also show significant differences. Toba Batak houses, for example, are boat-shaped with intricately carved gables and upsweeping roof ridges. Karo Batak houses rise up in tiers. Both are built on piles and are derived from an ancient Dong-Son model. Villages Toba Batak village The Toba and Karo Batak live in permanent villages and cultivate irrigated rice and vegetables. On the other hand, the Angkola, the Mandailing, and the Pakpak practiced slash-and-burn agriculture which required frequent changes of location and their villages were only semi-permanent. Karo Batak village Irrigated rice cultivation can support a large population, and the Toba and the Karo live in densely clustered villages, which are limited to around ten homes to save farming land. Unirrigated slash-and-burn agriculture supported smaller villages with only several houses. All villages are located near watercourses and fields. Internecine Batak warfare before the twentieth century saw villages sited in easily defensible positions. High bamboo stockades fortified Pakpak villages and barriers of earthen ramparts with bamboo fencing and trees. Each Batak group has its own rules and traditions guiding village layout. Toba Batak houses are laid out side by side with their front gables facing the street. Traditionally, each house would have had a rice barn granary opposite which would a complementary row in the village. The street formed between the row of houses and the row of granaries is known as the alaman and is used as an area for work the drying of rice. The Mandailing also build their houses in row, however, like the Minangkabau the front gable faces the neighbouring house's rear gable. The Karo and the Pakpak do not lay their houses out in streets but around a village focal points such as the meeting hall (bale) or rice pounding house (lesung). Toba architecture Toba Batak houses near Lake Toba Batak Toba culture centres on Lake Toba and the sacred island of Samosir that lies within it. Jabu is the Toba language word for rumah adat. The houses are made up of three sections. A substructure of large wooden pillars resting on flat stones (or concrete nowadays) protects the structure from rising damp. Some of these pillars support longitudinal beams known as labe-labe, which run the length of the house at head height to carry the massive roof. Other pillars carry two large beams with carved singa heads which, with two lateral beams mortised into them, form a great ring beam bearing the small living area. The substructure is strengthened by beams mortised into the piles which double as night stalls for cattle. Walls are lightweight and lean outwards and provide additional stability to the structure. The wall and the wall plate supporting the rafters hang from the labe-labe with rattan cord, while the base of the wall sits on the ring beam. The rafters spring from the wall plate and are angled outwards producing the roof curve. In lieu of horizontal bracing battens, diagonal ties--running from the middle of the labe-labe to the gable ends--provide reinforcement. The large steeply-pitched saddle back roof dominates the structure. The roofs are traditionally thatched, and with no internal roof trusses they provide a large internal space. Sharply projected triangular eaves and gables overlap all around the substructure. The front gable extends further than the rear gable and is finely carved and painted with motifs of suns, starts, cockerels, and geometric motifs in red, white, and black. The rear gable remains plain. Toba Batak extended family alongside their intricately carved jabu house. c. 1900 The living area, which is supported by lateral and transverse beams, is small and dark. Light enters through a small window in each of the four sides. The inhabitants spend most of their time outdoors and the house is largely used for sleeping. An attic space is provided by a flat wooden ceiling over the front third of the living area. Family heirlooms and sometimes shrines are stored here. Traditionally, the Toba Batak would cook over a hearth at the front of the living room making the living area smoky. With recent changes in hygiene practises, the kitchen is now often in an extension at the rear of the house. The original Toba Batak houses were large communal houses, but these have now become rare, with most houses now built in the ethnic Malay style with both modern and traditional materials. While more spacious, better ventilated, brighter, and cheaper to build, the jabu is considered more prestigious. Where jabu are still lived, they are generally smaller single- family dwellings. Whereas previous versions of the jabu were accessed through a trap door concealing steps in the floor, times are now less dangerous and more convenient wooden ladders at the front of the house provide access. Toba Batak rice barns (sopo) were built in a similar style but are smaller than the jabu. Rice was stored within the roof and was supported by six large wooden pillars, which carried large wooden discs to prevent rodent ingress. The open platform beneath the roof structure was used as a working and general storage space and as a sleeping place for guests and unmarried men. Rice barns are now rarely used for grain storage, and many have been converted to living areas by walling off the open-air section between the sub-structure and the roof, and adding a door. Karo architecture Geometric ornamentation on Karo house c. 1914-1919. Each design has specific meaning or powers. Note the stylised cicak (gecko) along the length of each wall Karo houses beru-beru (hip and saddle), c. 1870 Karo house tesek (extra tier) Karo rumah anjong-anjong (miniature house above it as adornment) and si empat ayo (two saddle roofs at right angles) The Karo rumah adat (traditional house), known as 'Siwaluh Jabu', is, as with the Rumah Aceh, oriented North-South, possibly for shelter from the sun. Karo rumah adat are longhouses, for multiple family occupancy, up to twelve families in some areas, though usually eight. A Karo longhouse would be large, in order to accommodate so many families, and is built on stilts. The houses are constructed from wood, bamboo, using ijuk fibres for binding (no nails or screws are used) and for the thatched roof. The design is naturally earthquake-resistant. In order to choose a suitable site for the house, the guru (witch doctor) would be consulted, who would determine whether the land was bad or good. A plot would be staked out using coconut fronds, and other villagers would be given four days to object to the proposed construction. After the four-day period had elapsed, a hole was dug in the centre of the plot, into which was placed a knife, betel leaf and rice. The guru and the kalimbubu and anak beru would perform rites to determine that the ground was suitable. After the site was ready, a seven-day ceremony was performed, consulting the spirits of the forest (for wood) and arranging payment for the craftsmen responsible for creating decoration of the house. All the occupants of the village would then erect the pillars supporting the house, after which they would eat together. The colours used in Karo designs are red, white and black. The red signifies a zest for life, a 'get-up-and-go', the colour seen in traditional clothes used in weddings, black the colour of death, man's ignorance of Dibata's (God) will, and white, the colour of God's holiness. Ornamentation is very important in Karo houses, with Buffalo horns an essential decoration of the rumah adat, and two white-painted horns are mounted on each end of the roof (the mounting is done in the night, so nobody sees), using both male and female buffalo. Ornaments in Karo houses served traditionally to protect the residents from evil spirits, and to demonstrate the status of the owner. With the fading of traditional religious beliefs (permena), they are now largely decorative and a reminder of past cultural traditions. Ornaments of Karo homes are found in three ways: * The house is decorated with braided bamboo in a variety of geometric designs.Les Batak: des hommes en Indon√©sie : un peuple de l'√Æle de Sumatra The geometric designs have been classified into seventeen types, each having special magic properties, such as the Tupak salah Silima-lima (five-pointed star), symbolising the merga silima, and deterring those who would try to upset the integrity of it. * The kitchen is decorated with carvings * An intaglio carved gecko protects the occupants from evil spirits =Roof= The roof of the Karo house is different from other Batak peoples, being a hip roof. The roof is the dominant feature of the house, sometimes being as tall as 15 metres high, against the supports and walls, both around 1.5 metres each. The most basic house, known as rumah beru-beru, has a basic hip and saddle roof.Kinship, descent, and alliance among the Karo Batak - Masri Singarimbun The rumah tersek has a double-storied roof with a saddle roof on top of the lower part. This improves ventilation in the house, reducing the impact of cooking smoke. A house with four gables, known as a si empat ayo has two saddle roofs crossed at right angles. In some cases an anjong-anjong, or miniature house, may be placed atop the house for further decoration =Internal organization= The Karo adat house has two entrances, on the north and south ends, with a small terrace (ture) on each and stairs leading up to the house. The ture serves as a place to bathe children and to chat at night. The traditional eight-family Karo longhouse contained four kitchens, each shared between two close families, and containing two stoves each. The stoves was made using five stones as a symbol of the Karo merga silima (five Marga). The house was structured so that the pengulu (leader) of the house occupies the front-left room, with his sembuyak (parents) in the room to the right. In a mirror image, his anak beru and kalimbubu would occupy the corresponding rooms entering from the rear of the house. The four rooms in the middle of the house were of lower status and each contained a kitchen, which was shared with the rooms on their outside. =Keben= Traditional Karo keben (rice house), c. 1910-1930 The kebenBreath becomes the wind: old and new in Karo religion or rice barn is an important part of Karo culture, since rice represents a store of wealth, and the size of the keben therefore demonstrates one's wealth.

As a teenage actress, she reached the peak of her popularity in the 1970s with the \\"Really Really\\" film trilogy, which include Never Forget Me, I Am Really Sorry and I Really Really Like You. She is currently active in television. Career Im Ki-hee began modeling in popular teen magazines when she was in junior high school. Using the stage name Im Ye-jin, she made her acting debut in Kim Ki-young's Transgression in 1974. In 1975, Im played a high schooler in love with her teacher in Graduating School Girls, for which she won Best New Actress at the Grand Bell Awards. But it was a year later when she would be catapulted to stardom. Im headlined Never Forget Me (also known as Really Really Don't Forget, 1976) and its sequels I Am Really Sorry (also known as I'm Really Really Sorry, 1976) and Crazy For You (also known as I Really Really Like You, 1977) -- movies about teenage friendship, romance and aspirations that became massive box office hits, screening to sold out theaters. In an era when Korean cinema was in a dark period resulting from severe censorship by an authoritarian government, this led to the emergence of the teenage demographic as a major consumer of pop culture. Im had an innocent, girlish image, whose acting was charming and sweet without being saccharine, and she became hugely popular among middle school and high school students; girls wanted to be like her, and boys had her picture in their pockets. The \\"Really Really\\" series established Im as the most popular young actress of that period, and for the next several years, youth melodramas starring her dominated the theaters in quick succession, often with Lee Deok- hwa as her leading man: Prayer of a Girl (1976), Ever So Much Good! (1976), I Really Have a Dream (1976), I've Never Felt Like This Before (1976), and Nobody Knows (1977). Im entered college in 1979, studying Theater and Film at Dongguk University. By this time, she wanted to transition out of teen movies, and into more adult roles. She starred opposite Shin Seong-il in Love Song in a Peanut Shell, but it was poorly received, with audiences not prepared to see her break out of her \\"pure\\" image. Despite a supporting role in A Fine, Windy Day, Im's film career was in a slump, so she shifted her focus to television and radio in the 1980s. After a few years of forgettable television dramas, Im's career was revitalized by Kim Soo-hyun, one of the most famous TV writers in Korea. Among Kim's dramas that Im starred in were ÏÇ¨ÎûëÌï©ÏãúÎã§ (1981), Yesterday and Tomorrow (1982), Love and Truth (1984), Love and Ambition (1987), Farewell (1994), and Childless Comfort (2012). In Farewell, she shocked audiences by playing a Fatal Attraction-esque villain for the first time. Im also played the character Dal-soo in a series of one-act dramas for MBC Best Theater from 1995 to 2005. As Im grew older, she remained active on television and the occasional film, in supporting roles as ajummas, aunts or mothers. As if coming full circle, she played one of the adult characters in a 2010 musical theatre adaptation of her early hit I Really Really Like You. From 2008 to 2010, Im was a popular panelist on the variety show Quiz to Change the World, for which she was recognized at the MBC Entertainment Awards. In 2014, Im signed with the talent agency YG Entertainment. Personal life In 1989, Im married Choi Chang-wook, a TV director and producer at MBC.

Ezra Miller stars as the eponymous Gonzo, a high school student who creates an underground newspaper. Zoe Kravitz, Jesse McCartney, Griffin Newman, Campbell Scott, and Amy Sedaris appear in supporting roles. Its title refers to a style of first-person confrontational journalism developed by Hunter S. Thompson in the early 1970s. The film debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2010. Plot After being fired from his high school paper by editor Gavin Reilly, Eddie \\"Gonzo\\" Gilman establishes an underground paper with his friends Rob Becker, Ming Na, and Scheeman to give a voice to unpopular students. Eddie's idea catches the attention of Evie Wallace, who joins the paper's team out of disdain for Gavin. The first issue causes a commotion throughout the school and Principal Roy and Gavin offer to give Eddie his own section in the main paper if he tones down his content. Eddie, however, refuses to censor his articles, even under the threat of suspension. For the second issue, Eddie exposes the unsanitary conditions of his school's cafeteria, causing the cafeteria to be closed by the health inspector. The issue brings popularity to Eddie in the high school, which grows when Principal Roy suspends him. He and Evie also enter into a relationship. However, Gavin attempts to damage Eddie's reputation by falsely claiming Eddie staged the conditions as a favor to diner owner Errol, Eddie's first advertiser. Eddie retaliates by writing an expos√© on Gavin, where he reveals that Gavin had Schneeman write a paper for him in exchange for not being bullied and humiliated an anonymous girl (Evie) with his friends after having sex with her; information that Schneeman and Evie trusted him to not make public. After the article is released, Eddie's friends break off contact with him and he is indefinitely suspended from school, pending a likely expulsion. At the advice of his father, Eddie creates a video apologizing for his actions and his suspension is lifted.

He was killed during an uprising he started against the powerful official Tang Daoxi and posthumously demoted to commoner rank.  Background  Wang Zongyi was born in 892, before the founding of the Former Shu state, as Wang Jian's second son. His mother was a Lady Zhang, who later would be given the imperial consort title of Guifei (Ë≤¥Â¶É) after Wang Jian founded Former Shu. As his older brother Wang Zongren (ÁéãÂÆó‰ªÅ), born of a Lady Ma, was disabled in his youth, Wang Zongyi was considered in effect Wang Jian's oldest son, and at some point during Wang Jian's service as a Tang Dynasty general was given the honorific title of deputy director of the archival bureau (ÁßòÊõ∏Â∞ëÁõ£). When Wang Jian declared himself Emperor of Shu in 907, he created Wang Zongyi the Prince of Sui.  As crown prince  In 908, Wang Jian created Wang Zongyi crown prince. In 909, Wang Jian made him the titular commander of the imperial guards, and established headquarters for him, naming the headquarters Yonghe Hall (Ê∞∏ÂíåÂ∫ú). Wang Jian also selected a number of officials to serve on his staff.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. Wang Zongyi was said to be ugly in appearance, but talented in many things, particularly archery. However, he was also said to be arrogant and violent, paying no heed to the counsel of the officials Wang Jian put on his staff. He soon came into conflict with Wang Jian's close associate Tang Daoxi the director of palace communications, as he often made fun of Tang, leading to their mutually accusing each other of crimes. Wang Jian, not wanting them to be in constant conflict, made Tang the military governor (Jiedushi) of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) in 910 to separate them. Later in 910, Wang Jian renamed him Wang Yuantan. Subsequently, when Wang Jian made two tours away from the capital Chengdu to Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan) in 911 in response to attacks by Former Shu's northern neighbor Qi, he had Wang Yuantan serve as regent at Chengdu. In 912, apparently in reaction to an incident where Wang Yuantan found a bronze medallion on the outskirts of the city, which Wang Jian considered a sign of divine favor, Wang Jian renamed him Wang Yuanying. In 913, when Tang completed his term as the military governor of Shannan West and returned to Chengdu to again serve as the director of palace communications, Wang Yuanying submitted accusations against Tang and declared that Tang should not be again in charge of palace communications, Wang Jian was displeased, but subsequently reacted by making Tang an advisor to Wang Yuanying.  Uprising against Tang Daoxi and death  In fall 913, Wang Jian planned a vacation away from Chengdu for the Qixi Festival (on August 11 that year). The night before (August 10), Wang Yuanying held a feast for the imperial princes and high-level officials, but three invitees ‚Äî Wang Jian's adoptive son Wang Zonghan (ÁéãÂÆóÁø∞) the Prince of Ji, and the officials Pan Qiao (ÊΩòÂ≥≠, who succeeded Tang Daoxi as the director of palace communications) and Mao Wenxi (the chief imperial scholar) ‚Äî did not attend. Wang Yuanying, in anger, accused Pan and Mao in absentia of alienating his brothers from him. Meanwhile, Wang Yuanying's trusted officers Xu Yao (ÂæêÁë§) and Chang Qian (Â∏∏Ë¨ô) were gazing at Tang. Tang, in fear, fled from the feast. The morning next day (August 11, the date of the Qixi Festival), Wang Yuanying went to see his father Wang Jian and accused Pan and Mao of alienating him from his brothers. Wang Jian, believing the accusations, ordered Pan and Mao demoted, making Pan's brother Pan Kang the new director of palace communications. However, after Wang Yuanying then left the palace, Tang arrived, and Tang made the counteraccusation that Wang Yuanying was planning to rebel, and, as part of his planning, was planning to put the princes and the officials under arrest. Wang Jian, with his suspicions aroused, cancelled the Qixi vacation plans. Further, he agreed to Tang's request to mobilize the regular troops to defend the palace (rather than the imperial guards, who were formally under Wang Yuanying's command). Upon hearing that the regular troops had been mobilized, Wang Yuanying mobilized his own Tianwu Army (Â§©Ê≠¶Ëªç). He arrested Pan Qiao and Mao and almost battered them to death, in addition to arresting Pan Jiao (ÊΩòÂ∂†) the mayor of Chengdu. The next day (August 12), Xu, Chang, and Yan Lin (Âö¥Áíò), under Wang Yuanying's direction, attacked Tang's forces. Tang initially resisted, but tried to retreat when an arrow hit him. The crown prince's troops then routed his, killing him, and many of the troops under Tang were killed. In response, at Pan Kang's suggestion, Wang Jian summoned his adoptive sons Wang Zongkan (ÁéãÂÆó‰æÉ), Wang Zonghe (ÁéãÂÆóË≥Ä), and Wang Zonglu (ÁéãÂÆóÈ≠Ø), ordering them to launch an attack against Wang Yuanying's troops. They did so, along with another adoptive son, Wang Zong'an (ÁéãÂÆóÈªØ). They killed Xu in battle. Chang and Wang Yuanying fled to Longyao Pond (ÈæçË∫çÊ±†) and hid on a boat there. The next morning (August 13), Wang Yuanying came out of hiding and requested food from the boat owner. This was reported to Wang Jian, and he dispatched Wang Zonghan to try to comfort Wang Yuanying. However, before Wang Zonghan arrived at Longyao Pond, Wang Yuanying was killed by his own guard. Wang Jian initially mourned Wang Yuanying bitterly, but later decided that without declaring Wang Yuanying a renegade, he could not comfort the people, and therefore demoted Wang Yuanying to commoner rank, although, apparently at Wang Jian's direction, Wang Zonghan had Wang Yuanying's killer executed. Many of Wang Yuanying's associates were killed or exiled.  Notes and references  * Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 38. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 266, 267, 268.

He has appraised and helped place the papers of many notable Americans, ranging from W. Averell Harriman to Irving Berlin and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Life Born in Washington D.C., he attended St Albans, Hotchkiss, and Yale University, where he majored in American Studies, Class of 1952. He then entered Harvard Law School at the urging of his father, who hoped he would reestablish the link to the lawyers in their family. His grandfather and namesake, Willis Van Devanter, had served 26 years as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, from 1911 to 1937. Van Devanter knew that it would displease his father when he told him he wanted to drop out of Harvard Law to pursue his real love. Over breakfast one morning he reluctantly broke the news. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dropping out of law school,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want to go to Columbia and get a master‚Äôs degree in library science.‚Äú As Van Devanter recalled years later, his banker father looked at him with stunned disbelief and said, ‚ÄúYou want to be a librarian? That‚Äôs one of the three jobs open to women‚Äînurses, secretaries, librarians. A librarian is nothing but a file clerk!‚Äù Deeply wounded by his father's response, he sought a meeting with the Librarian of Congress to get his advice. After he recounted what his father had told him, the Librarian laughed and said, ‚ÄúIn essence, your father is right. We are all file clerks. But what a file it is! It contains the world‚Äôs body of knowledge.‚Äù Encouraged by the Librarian, he entered Columbia University the following fall. While at Columbia he began to attend the auctions held by Parker-Bernet (now Sotheby's) and Christie's in New York. ‚ÄúI would go to the previews that the auction houses held before a sale and buy their catalogs,‚Äù Van Devanter said. ‚ÄúI brought the catalogs back to my apartment and studied the material intensely. Then I assigned a price to the works on sale as though I was the art appraiser for the auction. As time went on, the price I assigned to the art work often came closer to the final sale price than the price set by Sotheby‚Äôs or Christie‚Äôs.‚Äù After receiving a master's degree from Columbia University, he served as a public information officer with the U.S. Military Command in Wiesbaden, Germany. Upon his discharge from the army, he became the acting curator of graphic arts at Princeton University. After Van Devanter worked a year at Princeton, his former mentor at Yale University, head librarian Jim Babb, recommended him for a job as the personal curator for Paul Mellon. Mellon's father, Andrew W. Mellon, a multimillionaire Pittsburgh businessman and a former U.S. Treasury Secretary, had established and‚Äîin effect‚Äîhad donated the National Gallery of Art in Washington to the people of the United States. His son Paul carried on his father's work as a philanthropist. At age 27, Van Devanter became Mellon's chief of staff for art and rare books. He did everything from working with art dealers to buying books and entertaining Mellon's guests. ‚ÄúEverything I know is based on Paul Mellon and the great experiences I had traveling around the world and finding treasures,‚Äù he said. Together they virtually cornered the market on the works of William Blake, the English poet, painter, and printmaker. Facsimiles were created from Blake's work and many of them wound up in American universities. When Van Devanter learned that Sotheby's might sell some of the works of John Locke, he flew to England, rented a bike, and chased down the Oxford librarian on his morning bicycle ride to work, to seek his cooperation. He also worked with Paul Mellon to buy and place the Vinland Map at Yale. The still controversial map, which was found in Spain, purportedly showed that the Norse had discovered America before Columbus. By the end of his 17-years as a Mellon associate, Van Devanter had helped assemble and catalog one of the greatest collections of Americana in the United States. The collection was, on Mellon's instructions, divided among two Virginia institutions and Yale upon his death. After leaving Paul Mellon, Van Devanter worked two years for a leading Washington D.C. art and antiques dealer, appraising paintings and books‚Äîand then struck out on his own. His reputation soon spread and he began to consult with museums and universities across America, including major institutions such as the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress. He proved to have a natural touch with the rich and poor, the celebrated or the unknown. Far from being an art snob, he treated everyone with equal respect, no matter the value of the treasures they brought for his appraisal. A Washington Post article in 2003 caught his business manner perfectly. ‚ÄúBook and art appraiser Willis Van Devanter,‚Äù the Post wrote, ‚Äúseemed to appreciate the family treasures laid before him in a meeting room of the Thomas Balch Library in Leesburg, some wrapped in bath towels and others covered by black trash bags. His voice was soft, and he found something nice to say about the worn items. But when it came to appraising their value, he was all business.‚Äù Van Devanter shifted gears easily when he was asked to appraise more weighty subjects, such as the hand-drawn sketches by the celebrated architect, Philip Johnson. According to the New York Times on August 8, 2010, Van Devanter described the Johnson archive as ‚Äúabsolutely essential to the study of modern architecture,‚Äù and called Johnson ‚Äúthe major influence in world architecture of the latter 20th Century.‚Äù As he entered his eighties, and was still riding a bicycle as his favorite mode of transportation, Willis Van Devanter was considered by many experts to be the preeminent document appraiser in America. He was called upon to appraise the papers of such diverse personages as the novelist Philip Roth and the Senator Robert Byrd. When asked by young people how to become an art appraiser, his answer was always the same. ‚ÄúStarve for ten years. Learn more than you ever thought you would have to know. And be damned lucky!‚Äù  References  1\\\\. All quotes by Willis Van Devanter in this article are from his memoir in progress entitled ART EXPERT: Appraising My Life by Willis Van Devanter. 2\\\\.

Ipswich, 15 December 1824, d. after 1850) was an English composer, pianist, and vocalist, who had an active concert career in the United States during the 1840s. She is best known for writing the songs \\"Roll on, Silver Moon\\", \\"Forget Thee\\", and the \\"Maiden's Farewell.\\" Forget Thee? (Boston Public Library)  Early life  Sloman was a child prodigy, distinguishing herself on piano from an early age under the tutelage of Louise Dulcken, Queen Victoria‚Äôs piano teacher. She made multiple appearances at the British royal court and played informally with the violin virtuoso Niccol√≤ Paganini and the gifted pianist Sigismond Thalberg. In 1839, she moved to the United States as one of the only female piano virtuosos in the country. Sloman gave piano lessons to a few students before she made her American concert debut.  Debut and Concert Career  Sloman‚Äôs debut was held at Niblo's Gardens in New York on 16 July 1841, when she was seventeen. She subsequently went on tour, performing in cities such as Philadelphia and Boston. As one of the first virtuosic female pianists to come to the United States, she was seen as a novelty. The Norton Grove Dictionary of Women Composers notes that ‚ÄúHer first concerts were accompanied by a biographical sketch which established her as a child prodigy who was entirely self-taught in composition, yet also modest and of a \\"good character\\" appropriate for a Victorian professional woman.‚Äù Her performances were received well, with the press in Boston noting her tasteful and passionate interpretations of Helz, D√∂hler, Thalberg, and Liszt. She was among the first generation of professional women composers that emerged in the 1850s including Augusta Browne, Marion Dix Sullivan, Faustina Hodges, and Emily A. Parkhurst. Her last known concert took place on February 18, 1850.  Songs and Compositions  Sloman wrote both popular songs and compositions. Her work ranged from simple pop tunes to the more classical, chromatic styles that characterized mid-19th century Romantic composers. She was often her own lyricist and was notable for providing a female perspective about love and courtship in her songs. In her feminist ballad ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Make Him Speak Out,‚Äù she expresses sentiments such as ‚ÄúAre women‚Äôs hearts playthings to be broken by boys?‚Äù She was also the editor of The Melodist, a vocal collection that featured her preferred piano accompaniments to popular songs and several original choral melodies set to lyric. Her compositions were published under the name Sloman Torry after 1862. While her last public appearance as a pianist occurred in 1850, her songs and compositions continued to be published until 1902, speaking to their lingering popularity.

A drummer was responsible for the army drums for use on the battlefield. Drums were part of the field music for hundreds of years, being introduced by the Ottomans to Europe. Chinese armies however had used drums even before that. With the professionalization of armies, military music was developed as well. Drums were not only used for the men to march in step, but were an important part of the battlefield communications system, with various drum rudiments used to signal different commands from officers to troops.U.S. Civil War History & Genealogy ‚Äì The Drummer Boys, genealogyforum.com By the second half of the 18th century, most (if not all) Western armies had a standardized set of marches and signals to be played, often accompanied by fifers. The idea of the \\"Drummer Boy\\" The romantic idea about drummers is that they were young boys (for instance the Christmas carol \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\", or the painting \\"Steady the Drums\\"). The fact, though, is that drummers were more often adult men, recruited like the common soldiers. Fifers, on the other hand, being not an official part of the regiments early on, were usually recruited from young boys. During the second half of the 19th century, it was accepted in many western armies that under aged boys served as drummers. Although there were usually official age limits, these were often ignored; the youngest boys were sometimes treated as mascots by the adult soldiers.

Nathan Futrell (1773‚Äì1829) was said to have been the youngest drummer boy in the American War of Independence; he joined the North Carolina Continental Militia at the age of 7. In 1793, Joseph Bara, a 14-year-old French Republican drummer at the time of the War in the Vend√©e, was killed by royalist counter- revolutionaries, supposedly while he was shouting \\"Long live the Republic!\\". His body was interred at the Panth√©on along with other national heroes.Dupuy, Pascal, La Mort de Bara http://www.histoire-image.org L‚ÄôHistoire par l‚Äôimage (in French). Retrieved: 19 January 2015 Andr√© Estienne was a drummer with Napoleon Bonaparte's army at the Battle of the Bridge of Arcole in 1796, where he led his battalion across a river while holding his drum over his head, and on reaching the far bank, beat the \\"charge\\". This led to the capture of the bridge and the rout of the Austrian army. Despite being 19 years old, he became famous as Le Petit Tambour d'Arcole (), and is depicted in the Panth√©on in Paris and on the Arc de Triomphe, also in paintings by Charles Th√©venin and Horace Vernet.Fondation Napol√©on ‚Äì Honorary drumsticks presented to the drummer of Arcole On 19 April 1855, at the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, there was a bayonet attack by the British 77th Regiment of Foot on some rifle pits which the Russians were using to snipe at British positions. Accompanying the attack was an unnamed drummer boy of the 77th, who seeing a Russian boy trumpeter trying to escape, caught hold of him and beat him with his fists \\"in truly British fashion\\" until he surrendered. The boy presented the Russian trumpet to Sir George Brown and he was later rewarded by General Lord Raglan, the British commander.Thomas Carter, Medals of the British Army: and How They Were Won: Volume 1, Groombridge and Son, London 1861 (p.77) At the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, 12-year-old Drummer Ross of the 93rd Highlanders signalled the arrival of his regiment to the besieged garrison, by climbing the spire of the Shah Najaf Mosque and playing the regimental march on his bugle, while under heavy fire from the rebel forces.Holmes, (p.275) On 28 November 1857 at the Second Battle of Cawnpore, 15-year-old Thomas Flynn, a drummer with the 64th Regiment of Foot, was awarded the Victoria Cross. \\"During a charge on the enemy's guns, Drummer Flynn, although wounded himself, engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter with two of the rebel artillerymen\\".

Thirteen-year-old Charles King was the youngest soldier killed in the entire American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). Charles enlisted in the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry with the reluctant permission of his father at the age of 12 years, 5 months and 9 days. On September 17, 1862 at the Battle of Antietam he was mortally wounded near or in the area of the East Woods, carried from the field and died three days later. Twelve-year-old drummer boy William Black was the youngest recorded person wounded in battle during the American Civil War. John Clem, who had unofficially joined a Union Army regiment at the age of 9 as a drummer and mascot, became famous as \\"The Drummer Boy of Chickamauga\\" where he played a \\"long roll\\" and shot a Confederate officer who had demanded his surrender. An 11-year-old drummer in the Confederate Orphan Brigade, known only as \\"Little Oirish\\", was credited with rallying troops at the Battle of Shiloh by taking up the regimental colors at a critical moment.Nofi, (p.108) In Costa Rica, the Drummer boy Juan Santamar√≠a died in an act of self-sacrifice in the war against the US Filibuster William Walker and is commemorated as his country's National Hero. Decline The Last Stand at Isandlwana by Charles Edwin Fripp shows a small drummer boy in the ranks, despite the youngest soldier present being over 16 years old The use of drums beyond the parade ground declined rapidly as the 19th century progressed, being replaced by the bugle in the signalling role, although it was often the drummers who were required to play them. A widely reported incident at the Battle of Isandlwana during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, spelled the end of boys being sent on active service by the British Army. Part of the British force returned to their camp at night to find that it had been overrun by the Zulu army a few hours previously. An eyewitness reported that \\"Even the little drummer boys that we had in the band, they were hung up on hooks, and opened like sheep. It was a pitiful sight\\". Doubt has since been cast on this account, since the youngest drummer to be killed was 18, and the youngest boy present was 16.Ian Knight, Zulu Rising: The Epic Story of iSandlwana and Rorke's Drift, Pan Books 2011 Despite this, Charles Edwin Fripp's famous painting, The Last Stand at Isandlwana, shows a small blond-haired boy amongst the adult soldiers.Ian Knight, Isandlwana 1879: The Great Zulu Victory, Osprey Publishing Limited 2002, (p.64) The US Army kept drummers and fifers with the infantry, until they were finally abolished in the field in 1917.

History  = Early years = Africa and Canada had few contacts before the twentieth century. A small number of Africans were taken as slaves to Canada during the Atlantic slave trade. However slavery in Canada was not a major part of the economy or social system, either under French (1534‚Äì1763) or British rule. A few Christian missionaries from Canada may have visited Africa. Canada and Africa were both part of a global trading system, linked by European trading companies such as the Hudson's Bay Company and the Royal African Company. However, as both Canada and African were raw-material exporting areas, they mostly traded with manufacturers in Europe, and not with each other. Canadians first became involved with African politics because of British imperial wars there. A group of 386 Canadian voyageurs participated in the 1884-1885 Nile Expedition during the Mahdist War in Sudan. A larger Canadian contingent took part in the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), helping to keep South Africa within the British Empire. = After African independence = Following the era of Decolonization in Africa, Canada was one of the few major industrialized Western countries that had good initial relations with most independent countries. This was because of several important Canadian characteristics shared with African countries, according to a 2004 briefing note by the Canadian Council on Africa. Canada's two official languages, English and French are two of the most widely spoken in Africa. Canada's official multiculturalism (after 1971) and growing African-Canadian community have also helped relations. Canada uses both the English common law system and French civil code (Province of Quebec only) that are used in much of Africa. Canada is the only G8 country that never possessed any overseas colonies, thus Canadians do not carry any imperial baggage in Africa\\". Canada shares many geographic similarities to many African countries in that the latter are large, sparsely-populated wild areas with few major cities and face major challenges with the delivery of government services, much like Canada at the beginning of the 20th century. Both Canada and most African countries rely on natural resource development and international trade for economic growth. Canadian companies also play a major part in the mining and resource development sector in Africa, with over $3.5 billion in capital invested on the continent. This makes it the single largest foreign investor in resource development. Canada is also a member of both the Commonwealth and La Francophonie, which together include most countries in Africa.http://www.africa-ata.org/can_af.pdf During the 1990s, Canadian involvement in African dropped as the result of government cutbacks to the aid and foreign affairs budgets. This was largely reversed during the short government of Paul Martin, whose government announced several new commitments to Africa. During this period, Canada grew to become the 3rd largest foreign donor in Africa, with numerous humanitarian development projects spanning many countries. The majority of these projects were administered by the Canadian International Development Agency, with funding provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. However, relations have deteriorated under the government of Stephen Harper, which is cited as one of the reasons Canada failed to win a seat on the UN Security Council in 2010. That same year the Canadian government also suspended all aid to Africa, a sharp shift from its position as a key humanitarian donor and development partner in Africa.

Consisting of massive to poorly bedded shale, mudstone, and siltstone, it weathers readily to a rounded hilly topography with clayey, loamy soils in which landslides and slumps are frequent. It is recognizable on the south slopes of the Santa Ynez Mountains as the band at the base of the mountains which supports grasses rather than chaparral. Outcrops of the unit are infrequent, with the best exposures on the coastal bluffs near Naples, in the San Marcos Foothills, at the Tajiguas Landfill, and in road cuts.

Accessed at www.cityofgoleta.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=649 Type locality and extent The type locality of the unit is in Ventura County, on the east side of Rincon Mountain, where the formation is exposed in the south-flowing Los Sauces Canyon, north of U.S. Highway 101 and in the vicinity of the Rincon Oil Field.Dibblee (1966), 42 The unit is mapped from Ventura County westward along the south slope of the Santa Ynez Mountains, as well as on portions of the north slope. It also occurs in a few places north of the Santa Ynez Fault, but outcrops nowhere north of the Santa Ynez River. In the subsurface it frequently is found in well cores, underlying the Monterey Formation and overlying the Vaqueros Formation. At the ground surface, the contact with the Vaqueros is obvious along the south slope of the mountains, for it is almost always defined by the line dividing the rounded, grassy foothills from the more rugged, chaparral-covered sandstones upslope. Thickness of the unit at the surface ranges from about 1400 to 1700 feet south of the mountain crest, averaging 1600 feet. It is less thick north of the mountains, attaining a maximum thickness of around 1000 feet at the western end of its range, and thinning to the east. In the subsurface under the Santa Barbara Channel the thickness is variable but generally less than onshore. In well cores in the Hondo Offshore Oil Field the thickness is around 600 feet, while in the abandoned Coal Oil Point field it is 900 feet, and in the Cuarta Offshore Oil Field it is over 1200 feet thick.California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR).

The Rincon Formation is massive to poorly bedded, and consists of predominantly argillaceous to silty shale and mudstone, with occasional dolomite. Two layers of siliceous shale are found in the middle of the unit, and they outcrop noticeably in the region west of Goleta.Minor, S.A., Kellogg, K.S., Stanley, R.G., Gurrola, L.D., Keller, E.A., and Brandt, T.R., 2009, Geologic Map of the Santa Barbara Coastal Plain Area, Santa Barbara County, California: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Map 3001, scale 1:25,000, 1 sheet, pamphlet, 38 p.Dibblee, Thomas. Geology of the central Santa Ynez Mountains, Santa Barbara County, California. Bulletin 186, California Division of Mines and Geology. San Francisco, 1966. 51.Dibblee (1966), 42-43 The base of the unit, which rests conformably on the shallower-water Vaqueros Formation, contains a glauconitic layer. Several thin layers of bentonite occur within the unit, and the unit is capped by one as well, which forms the base of the conformably overlying Monterey Formation. North of the Santa Ynez River, the Rincon is typically capped not by the Monterey but by the Temblor Formation, a sandstone similar to the underlying Vaqueros; additionally, north of the river the Rincon Formation grades into this sandstone to the east.Dibblee (1966), 43 Northeast of Blue Canyon and the Little Pine Fault, in the backcountry of easternmost Santa Barbara County and Ventura County, the Rincon Formation disappears, and the Temblor Formation rests unconformably on the much older Cozy Dell Shale.Dibblee (1966), p. 48-49 The Rincon Shale was deposited on the deep sea floor during the time at which the Miocene sea reached its greatest depth. The faunal assemblage found as fossils and fragmentary fossils indicates that the sea was tropical to subtropical at this time. During this period the sea deepened due to tectonic forces, as the area of deposition was at the collision boundary of the North American and Pacific Plates, shortly after the Farallon Plate had been completely buried beneath the American plate.Deborah R. Harden. California Geology. Prentice Hall, 1997. p. 433 At that time only clay- and mud-sized grains could reach the deposition location, since it was far from the shore, and sediment accumulated slowly. The unit represents a period of around 7.5 million years ‚Äì from 24 Ma (million years before present) to 17.5 ‚Äì covering, with the Vaqueros Formation, the entirety of the lower Miocene.Gregory A. Miles and Catherine A. Rigsby. \\"Lithostratigraphy and Depositional Environments of the Vaqueros and Upper Sespe/Alegria Formations, Hondo Field, Santa Barbara Channel, California.\\" SEPM Core Workshop No. 14. San Francisco, June 3, 1990. p. 47 The Rincon Formation weathers to a distinctive loamy, black soil with a high expansion- contraction potential, presenting a risk to structures built on soils derived from the formation. Landslides and slumps are frequent on soils produced from the Rincon, although they usually are not large, limited to about 15 feet in depth. As is common with shale units, the formation has a low permeability, and therefore where oil and gas reservoirs occur in the area it serves as the impermeable cap keeping the hydrocarbons in place. Some of these reservoirs include the Ellwood Oil Field, Gaviota Offshore Gas Field, Cuarta Offshore Oil Field, Molino Gas Field, and others.DOGGR, p. 652, 654, 658, 660, 666 Paleontology Microfossils are common in the Rincon, and have been helpful in dating the unit.Richard G.

Paleontological Resources section from the Lompoc Wind Project Final Environmental Impact Report . 3.12-4 In Ventura County, the exposure of the formation along Los Sauces Creek has yielded ten different species of ostracoda; a detailed study suggested that the sea bottom they inhabited was around 2,000 meters deep, very near to the edge of the continental shelf.Kenneth L.

Available here Radon is a byproduct of radioactive decay of uranium, which is present in the Rincon at around 20 to 30 parts per million (ppm). A 1993 study found that approximately 74% of homes built on the Rincon Formation, or on alluvium or soils derived from the Rincon Formation, showed interior radon concentrations in excess of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/l), the U.S. EPA action level, and 26% had measured levels of radon over 20 pCi/l.Donald Carlisle, Haydar Azzouz: \\"Discovery Of Radon Potential In The Rincon Shale, California ‚Äì A Case History Of Deliberate Exploration.\\" International Journal of Indoor Environment and Health. Vol 3, Issue 2, pp. 131-142, June 1993. Abstract available here. According to the U.S. EPA, non- smokers exposed to radon at the 20 pCi/l level over a lifetime had a risk of dying from lung cancer at 36 in 1000, as opposed to 7 in 1000 at the 4 pCi/l level, and 2 per 1000 at the average indoor radon level in the United States of 1.3 pCi/l. Smokers were at a much greater risk, with fully 260 out of 1,000 expected to die of lung cancer with a lifetime exposure of 20 pCi/l of radon.Health Risk from Radon: United States Environmental Protection Agency] Radon migrates upwards from its source, entering buildings wherever the bottom is imperfectly sealed, for example through cracks in a concrete slab. If a structure is poorly ventilated ‚Äì such as when the windows remain shut during the cool season ‚Äì radon can accumulate to a hazardous level.Martha Lannon, \\"Radon, how dangerous is it?\\" Goleta Valley Voice, Goleta, California. Some of the mitigation measures employed in houses on the Rincon Formation since the discovery of the problem in the 1990s include building ventilation systems for the air space beneath the structure, performing \\"soil suction\\" in which the gas is pulled directly from the soil under the building, and active house pressurization, which keeps the gas from entering.Radon reduction technologies: U.S. EPA References and notes Category:Geologic formations of California Category:Miocene California Category:Geology of Ventura County, California Category:Natural history of Santa Barbara County, California Category:Santa Ynez Mountains Category:Transverse Ranges ","title":"Rincon Formation"},{"id":"29546258","text":"Sierraville Dearwater Airport is a county-owned public-use airport located one nautical mile (2 km) southeast of the central business district of Sierraville, in Sierra County, California, United States.

He had been appointed captain of the 4 man team, 2 of them by the names of Ike Quartey and Alfred Kotey. Ankamah had never seen a boxing glove until the age of 20, when his brother brought him into the city to see an exhibition Azumah Nelson was doing. Alfred asked his brother, \\" people pay to see you tie something on your hands and hit someone else? Oh, this is simple, take me to the place I learn this.\\" Then at 21, he was chosen the Olympic team captain over Ike, who had been groomed for boxing since he was 8 years old. Ankamah, was chosen because of his dedication, as well as being very dependable and responsible, His \\"work ethic\\" is what also prompted him being the picked as the team captain. He would go on to knockout Malawi's Boston Simbeye. Unfortunately, since Ankamah by nature is a slugger, not a boxer, he met Kenneth Gould in his second pick, and lost a decision.

Mathis also tackled recent easy listening fare on this album (\\"A Taste of Honey\\", \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars (Corcovado)\\") in addition to show tunes from On a Clear Day You Can See Forever and West Side Story. The first single from the album, \\"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\\", debuted on Billboard magazine's list of the 40 most popular Easy Listening songs in the US a few months before the album's release, in the issue dated November 6, 1965, and made it to number 6 during a 15-week chart run.. In the meantime it also spent two weeks on Billboard's Hot 100 that began in the December 18 issue and included a peak position at number 98.. The Shadow of Your Smile had its first appearance on the magazine's Top LP's chart in the issue dated April 2, 1966, and began a run of 45 weeks there, where it got as high as number nine.. This was the most number of weeks that an album of his stayed on their list since Johnny's Mood in 1960 and the highest chart position an album of his achieved since 1960's The Rhythms and Ballads of Broadway. The Shadow of Your Smile was released for the first time on compact disc on November 6, 2012, as one of two albums on one CD, the second of the two being his previous LP, The Sweetheart Tree. Both were also included in Sony's Mathis box set The Complete Global Albums Collection, which was released on November 17, 2014. History Mathis and fellow easy listening singers like Williams began to succumb to the effects of the British Invasion by early 1966. \\"The Beatles had ushered in the era of the performer- songwriter; therefore, good songs just weren‚Äôt getting past the artists who were recording them for their own releases. The result was a steady emergence of what in the industry became known as the 'cover album', upon which songs that had achieved a certain level of popularity were recorded or 'covered' by a number of artists and savored by their loyal fans.\\" Two of the Fab Four's quieter numbers, \\"Michelle\\" and \\"Yesterday\\", were understandable choices to present to the Mathis audience, but he recalled that it was still not an easy fit. \\"'I wasn't quite sure how to go about it because their recordings were so minimalist as far as orchestrations and sounded perfect when they did it, but I found it difficult to repeat. But I did get the chance to sing on \\"Michelle\\" with John Pisano, who is a great, great guitarist and a wonderfully nice man.'\\" It was the Mancini-Mercer tune \\"Moment to Moment\\", however, that stayed in the Mathis repertoire through the decades and even was performed for a phone-in fan on the A&E; Network's 1998 Mathis concert Live by Request. In 2012 Mathis said, \\"'I used to perform it constantly, but now by the time I get to the end and some of those high notes, I can hardly pull it off anymore.'\\" Reception Billboard proclaimed, \\"Another superb Mathis performance to delight his multitude of followers,\\" and upon the album's CD release Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote, \\"Not only is The Shadow of Your Smile one of Mathis's most popular records, it's one of his strongest.\\" Track listing =Side one= #\\"Moment to Moment\\" from Moment to Moment (Henry Mancini, Johnny Mercer) ‚Äì 2:23 #\\"The Shadow of Your Smile\\" from The Sandpiper (Johnny Mandel, Paul Francis Webster) ‚Äì 3:03 #\\"Michelle\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) ‚Äì 2:33 #\\"Yesterday\\" (Lennon, McCartney) ‚Äì 3:04 #\\"Something's Coming\\" from West Side Story (Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim) ‚Äì 2:50 #\\"A Taste of Honey\\" (Rick Marlow, Bobby Scott) ‚Äì 3:09 =Side two= #\\"I'm in Love for the Very First Time\\" from An Alligator Named Daisy (Paddy Roberts, Jack Woodman) ‚Äì 3:15 #\\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars (Corcovado)\\" (Antonio Carlos Jobim, Gene Lees) ‚Äì 2:26 #\\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\" (George Cory, Douglass Cross) ‚Äì 2:59 #\\"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\\" from On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (Alan Jay Lerner, Burton Lane) ‚Äì 2:43 #\\"Melinda\\" from On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (Lerner, Lane) ‚Äì 3:18 #\\"Come Back to Me\\" from On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (Lerner, Lane) ‚Äì 2:16 Recording dates From the liner notes for The Complete Global Albums Collection: *August 27, 1965: \\"Come Back to Me\\", \\"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\\" *September 14, 1965: \\"Melinda\\" *January 12, 1966: \\"Michelle\\", \\"Moment to Moment\\", \\"The Shadow of Your Smile\\", \\"A Taste of Honey\\" *January 13, 1966: \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\", \\"I'm in Love for the Very First Time\\", \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars (Corcovado)\\", \\"Something's Coming\\", \\"Yesterday\\" Personnel *Johnny Mathis ‚Äì vocals; liner notes(1966) The Shadow of Your Smile by Johnny Mathis [album jacket].

The term was created by Attorney Joseph H. Malley who initiated the Super-Cookie Class Actions in 2010. Cookies are recreated from backups stored outside the web browser's dedicated cookie storage. It may be stored online or directly onto the visitor's computer, in a breach of browser security. This makes them very difficult to remove. These cookies may be installed on a web browser that has opted to not receive cookies since they do not completely rely on traditional cookies. Purpose Web analytics collecting companies use cookies to track Internet usage and pages visited for marketing research. Sites that want to collect user statistics will install a cookie from a traffic tracking site that will collect data on the user. As that user surfs around the web the cookie will add more information for each site that uses the traffic tracking cookie and sends it back to the main tracking server. Zombie cookies allow the web traffic tracking companies to retrieve information such as previous unique user ID and continue tracking personal browsing habits. When the user ID is stored outside of a single browser's cookie storage, such as in a header injected by the network into HTTP requests, zombie cookies can track users across browsers on the same machine. Zombie cookies are also used to remember unique IDs used for logging into websites. This means that for a user that deletes all their cookies regularly, a site using this would still be able to personalize to that specific user. Implications A user that doesn't want to be tracked may choose to decline 3rd party cookies or delete cookies after each browsing session. Deleting all cookies will prevent some sites from tracking a user but it may also interfere with sites that users want to remember them. Removing tracking cookies is not the same as declining cookies. If cookies are deleted this causes the data collected by tracking companies to become fragmented. For example, counting the same person as two separate unique users would falsely increase this particular site's unique user statistic. This is why some tracking companies use a type of zombie cookie. Implementation According to TRUSTe: \\"You can get valuable marketing insight by tracking individual users' movements on your site. But you must disclose your use of all personally identifiable information in order to comply with the Fair Information Practices guidelines\\". Possible places in which zombie cookies may be hidden include: * Standard HTTP cookies * Storing cookies in and reading out web history * Storing cookies in HTTP ETags * Internet Explorer userData storage (starting IE9, userData is no longer supported) * HTML5 Session Storage * HTML5 Local Storage * HTML5 Global Storage * HTML5 Database Storage via SQLite * Storing cookies in RGB values of auto-generated, force-cached PNGs using HTML5 Canvas tag to read pixels (cookies) back out * Local shared objects (Flash cookies) * Silverlight Isolated Storage * Cookie syncing scripts that function as a cache cookie and respawn the MUID cookie * TCP Fast Open * TLS's Session ID If a user is not able to remove the cookie from every one of these data stores then the cookie will be recreated to all of these stores on the next visit to the site that uses that particular cookie. Every company has their own implementation of zombie cookies and those are kept proprietary. An open-source implementation of zombie cookies, called Evercookie, is available. Controversies In 2015, TURN, an online advertising clearinghouse,\\"Zombie Cookie: The Tracking Cookie That You Can't Kill\\" introduced zombie cookies based on Flash Local Shared objects. Privacy advocates quickly denounced the technology. An academic study of zombie cookies was completed in 2009, by a team of researchers at UC Berkeley, where they noticed that cookies which had been deleted, kept coming back, over and over again. They cited this as a serious privacy breach. Since most users are barely aware of the storage methods used, it's unlikely that users will ever delete them all. From the Berkeley report: \\"few websites disclose their use of Flash in privacy policies, and many companies using Flash are privacy certified by TRUSTe\\". Ringleader Digital made an effort to keep a persistent user ID even when the user deleted cookies and their HTML5 databases. The only way to opt-out of the tracking, was to use the company's opt-out link, which gives no confirmation. This resulted in a lawsuit against Ringleader Digital. The term \\"zombie cookie\\" was created by Attorney Joseph H. Malley who initiated the Super-Cookie Class Actions in 2010. The etiology of the phrase was derived from his prior research into Apple's third-party iPhone applications. Some of these which had been criticized as being \\"zombie-like\\" applications such as the \\"super-cookies\\" which \\"re-spawned\\" when deleted. Attorney Malley envisioned a cookie that seemed to come back from the \\"dead\\". Blending the two ideas, he first coined the phrase Zombie Cookies within his filed Class Actions, as a means to enable the court, jury, and public understand the basis of the litigation.[citation needed] The Zombie Cookie lawsuits were filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Quantcast, Clearspring, VideoEgg, and affiliated sites owned by Walt Disney Internet Group, Warner Bros. and others. According to the charges, Adobe Flash cookies are planted to \\"track Plaintiffs and Class Members that visited non-Clearspring Flash Cookie Affiliates websites by having their online transmissions intercepted, without notice or consent\\". Two \\"supercookie\\" mechanisms were found on Microsoft websites in 2011, including cookie syncing that respawned MUID cookies. Due to media attention, Microsoft later disabled this code. Consumer outrage related to Flash cookies and violation of consumers' privacy caused U.S. Congressional Hearings, led by Senators Al Franken and John Rockefeller. Reportedly, the \\"Zombie Cookie\\", aka Flash Cookie filings, forced Adobe Systems Inc. to stop processing flash cookies on 98% of all consumers' computing devices. The online advertising clearinghouse TURN implemented zombie cookies on Verizon mobile phones, using a hidden, unremovable number by which Verizon could track customers. After an article by ProPublica revealed this fact in January 2015, TURN claimed it had suspended usage of their zombie cookies.

Gordon; Religious Leaders of America: a Biographical Guide Gale Research Inc, Detroit & London, 1991; page 159-160 He has, since then, served nine terms on CoG's National Board.five as Public Information Officer (with Dierdre Pulgram Arthen in 1991 and Michael Thorn in 1992), two as First Officer (with Diana Paxson in 1988 and Catherine Starr in 1996), and two as First Officer Emeritus Frew's work as Public Information Officer for CoG led him into communication and collaboration with parts of society traditionally in tension with the Craft community: law enforcement, conservative Evangelical Christianity, and the then-nascent interfaith movement. Frew and his wife wrote a revision of the Gardnerian Book of Shadows, annotating the basic text to multiple books of shadows from different parts of the U.S. and U.K. to Gardner's and Valiente's book of shadows, and to many other historic documents.  Work with law enforcement  Since 1985 Frew has worked with San Francisco police Inspector Sandi Gallant as a consultant on the occult,Melton, Religious Leaders of America growing over the years to collaboration with law enforcement agencies around the country. Frew served as an occult expert / consultant on the McMartin Preschool Trial, the Leonard Lake serial killings, and the Matamoros murders, among others. In 1986, with his college friend Shawn Carlson, Frew proposed that the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion (CSER) investigate the rising and widespread claims of \\"Satanic Ritual Abuse\\" or \\"SRA.\\" A two-year investigation followed, by members of CSER, Robert Hicks of the Justice Department, and Ken Lanning of the FBI, with Frew, Carlson, and others.David Alexander, \\"Giving The Devil More Than His Due\\", The Humanist, March/April 1990; Melton, Religious Leaders of America The results were published in as \\"Satanism in America: How the Devil Got Much More than his Due\\".Shawn Carlson, Gerald LaRue, et al., Satanism in America, CSER, Buffalo NY, 1989 This report, finding no evidence of organized criminal activity by Satanist groups, turned the tide of law enforcement opinion against claims of widespread criminal activity by Satanic cults.summarized in the pamphlet \\"Satanic Crime in America: Wild Rumors, Reasonable Explanations\\", Gaia Press, El Cerrito CA, 1992  Work with evangelical Christians  In 1986, Frew approached and began a dialogue with the Spiritual Counterfeits Project,Spiritual Counterfeits Project a Berkeley-based Evangelical Christian research organization focused against cults and the occult. Frew and SCP founder Brooks Alexander organized a ground-breaking series of ten four-hour dialogues on topics of interest to both Christians and Witches, between members of the SCP and members of the Covenant of the Goddess. Frew and Alexander have remained friends and advocates for dialogue between Witches and Christians. Frew contributed to Alexander's book Witchcraft Goes MainstreamBrooks Alexander, Witchcraft Goes Mainstream, Harvest House Publisher, Eugene OR, 2004, pp 11 - 14 in 2004. To pursue the belief that interfaith groups need to communicate even with the most conservative elements of Christianity and Islam, Frew also reached out to and developed a working relationship with Lee Penn,Lee Penn the most vocal detractor of the United Religions Initiative and author of False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One-World Religion.Lee Penn, False Dawn, Sophia Perennis, Hillsdale NY, 2004 Frew is one of the most often cited sources in Penn's book.  Interfaith work  Frew has worked to obtain recognition of Pagan and Indigenous peoples as members of interfaith councils. As a Wiccan, Frew joined the Berkeley Area Interfaith Council (BAIC) in 1985, and was elected to its Executive Committee in 1986. In 1987 he was appointed Executive Secretary, becoming the first Witch to serve as an officer on the Board of a local interfaith council in the United States. BAIC was a member of the North American Interfaith NetworkNorth American Interfaith Network (NAIN), an association of interfaith councils of Canada and the US, and during Frew's term the Covenant of the Goddess became the first Pagan organization listed in NAIN's Directory. Through Frew's efforts, in 1992 the Covenant of the Goddess became one of four Neopagan organizations to co-sponsor the 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions,1993 Parliament of the World's Religions Program of Events, Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions, Chicago IL, 1993, p 14 where over 8000 international attendees attended over 900 programs in the course of nine days.

Frew and other interfaith organizers in Berkeley created the \\"Celebrating the Spirit\\"Berkeley Area Interfaith Council conference, an official UN50 event that continued discussions concerning the \\"Global Ethic\\" document that had been signed at the Assembly at the 1993 Parliament. Frew has continued to represent CoG at all of the subsequent Parliaments‚ÄîCape Town 1999, Barcelona 2004, Melbourne 2009‚Äîand be active in key events.

In 2000 he attended its charter signing ceremony in Pittsburgh PA. In 2002 he was elected to the URI's first Global Council (Board of Trustees), becoming the first Neopagan to serve on the board of a global interfaith organization. The United Religions Initiative has grown to be the largest grassroots interfaith organization on Earth, involving over 2.5 million people involved in over 650 Cooperation Circles in 86 countrieshttp://www.uri.org/Cooperation_Circles.html and Frew has stayed closely involved. He was appointed an At-Large trustee in both the second and third terms of the URI's Global Council, and a Continuing Trustee in its fourth term. Frew helped found many URI Cooperation Circles, including the Spirituality & the Earth CC (S&ECC;) which he coordinates. It has been hosting annual \\"People of the Earth\\",\\"People of the Earth\\" conferences at the Interfaith Center at the Presidio since 2008; has arranged for English lessons, computer training, and video training for Latin American indigenous representatives involved in interfaith work, and maintains a website to assist with their networking efforts.

The ICP is a consortium of over a dozen interfaith councils, seminaries, and interfaith organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area that work together to maintain a permanent site for ongoing interfaith work in the Presidio's Main Base Chapel.  Research on origins of Wicca  Frew is a leading proponent arguing that modern Wicca stretches back to the paganism of Classical Antiquity. Frew finds a genuine antiquity to core cosmological concepts and liturgical elements in Gardnerian Craft. His work focuses on parallels between Gardnerian Wicca and the theurgy of the later Neoplatonists.Gardnerian Wica as Theurgic Ascent While the definitive text is in production, he has presented talks and papers on this subject in a number of Pagan venues, including: *\\"Crafting the Art of Magic: A Critical Review\\", serialized in The Hidden Path and other journals, also available online\\" Crafting the Art of Magic,\\" *\\"Gardner & Crowley: the Overstated Connection\\", PantheaCon 1996 *\\"Ye Bok of ye Art Magical: A presentation of pages from this early Craft document\\", PantheaCon 1997, revised & updated 1998 *\\"Methodological Problems in Recent Studies of Historical and Modern Witchcraft\\", PantheaCon 1998Donald H.

It grew out of the Social Credit Party of Canada, and for most of its existence it was registered under the Social Credit name. Origins In 1986, the Rev. Harvey Lainson defeated Holocaust denier Jim Keegstra to become leader of Canada's moribund Social Credit Party. Although Lainson ran on a right-wing platform, he was not associated with Keegstra's ideology. After becoming Social Credit leader, Lainson rebranded the party as the Christian Freedom Party of Canada. According to its official literature, the party was centred on three principles: \\"God is creator of the universe,\\" \\"the Bible is the Word of God,\\" and \\"Jesus Christ is Lord.\\" It also described the human individual as \\"the most important of all God's creations,\\" and opposed any system of government that was considered to favour the rights of the state over the rights of the individual.Steven Charles, \\"New party based on Christian principles,\\" Kingston Whig-Standard, 15 April 1988, p. 1. When evangelist Ken Campbell became leader of the Social Credit Party in 1990, he continued to describe it as the Christian Freedom Party in public addresses.\\"CLERGYMAN WHO RENOUNCED HIS CANANDIAN CITIZENSHIP IN RESPONSE TO BILL C-43 ADDRESSES NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER ON PARLIAMENT HILL, SAT., JUNE 2\\" [press release], Canada NewsWire, 1 June 1990, 15:39. For tax purposes, it was still called the Social Credit Party on official party documents.\\"Minister wants God in the unity accord,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 28 September 1992, A11. Political activities in the 1990s Campbell announced in 1992 that he would run as a Christian Freedom candidate in the next federal election, but that he had no intention of winning and simply wanted a platform to express his religious convictions. He added that he would encourage voters to support the Reform Party because of its populist leanings. (Campbell had done the same thing in the 1991 Toronto mayoral election, when he entered the campaign to encourage voters to support June Rowlands.) He clarified that his support for Reform was intended as a temporary alliance, and that he would withdraw his support if and when the party abandoned its original goals.Elizabeth Patton, \\"Campbell wants to campaign against himself, for Reform,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 6 January 1992, T1. As leader of the Christian Freedom Party, Campbell supported traditional social credit economic theory and called for a cap on borrowing charges applied by banks.Elizabeth Patton, \\"Campbell wants to campaign against himself, for Reform,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 6 January 1992, T1. He also promoted an anti-abortion message.Brad Honywill, \\"Rev. Ken tosses hat into ring,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 22 September 1993, T2. Electoral history In May 1993, the Government of Canada approved changes to the Canada Elections Act requiring that political parties field at least fifty candidates in general elections to be registered with Elections Canada. Existing parties unable to meet this requirement were to be deregistered and have their assets liquidated. Campbell strongly opposed this legislation and, somewhat improbably, supported the Communist Party of Canada in its bid for an injunction until after the next election.Joseph Hall, \\"Right wing backs Communists' fight for political life,\\" Toronto Star, 27 September 1993, A14. In a letter to Communist leader Miguel Figueroa, he wrote, \\"While we are obviously poles apart philosophically...we support your democratic right to exercise that freedom of speech and of association.\\"Brad Honywill, \\"Parties appeal to court,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 24 September 1993, B7. The injunction was not granted, however, and the provisions of the legislation remained in place. Campbell tried to field fifty Christian Freedom candidates in the 1993 federal election, which would have permitted him to officially launch the party under its new name.Brad Honywill, \\"Rev. Ken tosses hat into ring,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 22 September 1993, T2. The party was only able to field around ten candidates, however, and it was deregistered by Elections Canada in October 1993.\\"Communists lose official party status,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 30 June 1994, B5; \\"Striking at the fringe,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 4 October 1993, A8. As a result, its candidates appeared on the ballot as non- affiliated. Campbell ran in Oakville‚ÄîMilton while anti-abortion protester Linda Gibbons ran for the party in Rosedale. Both identified as Christian Freedom candidates and Campbell also identified as a Social Credit candidate.Nicolaas van Rijn, Kym Adams, Patty Winsa and Cathy Telfer, \\"Meet all the candidates in Oct. 25 federal election,\\" Toronto Star, 21 October 1993, BR2; \\"Rosedale,\\" Toronto Star, 22 October 1993, A8. Douglas Stelpstra and Jim Brink had registered as Social Credit candidates in Brant and Hamilton East before the party was deregistered; Brink described himself as an independent during the campaign and does not seem to have used the Christian Freedom name.\\"NDP's Brant stronghold could see some changes,\\" Kitchener- Waterloo Record, 19 October 1993, A4; Michael Davie, \\"Seeking fringe votes,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 29 September 1993, B3.

It was the first airport in the county and one of the first in the state outside of Milwaukee. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The airport operated from 1922, three years after the state's first airport opened in Milwaukee, until 1990. It was formed when Clarence, Leonard, Newell, and Roy Larson cleared an 80 rod-long sod landing strip behind their barn. He had two Curtiss Canuck airplanes. They began barnstorming the United States at county fairs and offering flying lessons before building a hangar in 1924. Roy Larson barnstormed Wisconsin for Bob La Follette's 1924 Presidential campaign. The hangar allowed them to work and store on six airplanes. In 1926, the brothers formed the Roy Larson Aircraft Company for their repair work and created a corporation for all of their ventures as the Wisconsin Airways in the following year. Roy Larson died in 1929 while a student was flying the airplane that he was riding in. In 1932, the Milwaukee Journal called the airport the \\"finest airport in the state\\". Soon after, sod airports began fading as more powerful airplanes required longer paved runways. It temporarily closed following a federal mandate at the beginning of World War II. Leonard Larson trained fighter pilots for the war. By the late 1970s, it was the oldest airport in the state. Historic site The airport was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 5, 1984. A historic marker was unveiled along Wisconsin Highway 150 on September 29, 1985 describing the history of the airport. The National Register uses the airport's design as an example of an airport included because of its design/construction: \\"The Larsen Brothers Airport in Clayton, Winnebago County, Wisconsin, represents one of the earliest forms of airport design in the State.

In a career that spanned over three decades he photographed many of the leading African American actors of the stage and screen including James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson, Diana Sands, Louis Gossett, Jr., Billy Dee Williams, Morgan Freeman, Alfre Woodard, Denzel Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. Biography Bert J. Andrews was born in Chicago on March 21, 1929, the son of John and Frieda Andrews. At a young age, he moved to Harlem, where he grew up. His career began in the entertainment industry as a songwriter, singer and a dancer. In the early 1950s, while serving in the army, Andrews began studying photography. In 1953, soon after his discharge from the army, Andrews began his work as an apprentice for Chuck Stewart, who was well known for his photography of jazz musicians. He served in that capacity until 1957, when he branched out on his own, photographing among other things, stills for black theatre productions in New York City. One of his first assignments as a freelance photographer was the 1957 production of the play, Dark of the Moon, which was produced by the YMCA Drama Guild at the Little Theatre. This production was staged by Vinnette Carroll and featured among the cast Cicely Tyson, Roscoe Lee Browne and Clarence Williams III. Throughout his long career, Andrews would photograph numerous productions of important plays including The Blacks (1961), The Blood Knot (1964), To Be Young, Gifted and Black (1969), The River Niger (1972), Bubbling Brown Sugar (1976), A Soldier's Play (1982) and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (1984).

On January 29, 1985, a fire destroyed his studio at 750 Eighth Avenue at the corner of 46th Street in New York City. Somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 images were lost, spanning roughly thirty years of work. However, through the help of various theatre companies, Andrews was able to obtain prints of a significant number of his photographs including approximately 2,000 from the Negro Ensemble Company. In 1988, the Bert Andrews Photographic Collection of Blacks in the Theatre was established at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The following year, a collection of these photographs were published in the book In the Shadow of the Great White Way: Images from the Black Theatre (Thunder's Mouth Press, 1989). Andrews died of cancer at the Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on January 25, 1993 at the age of 63.

The group was founded in 2008 and has already hosted events such as: the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition Queer & Allies Summit and the Second Chance Prom. The Second Chance Prom was made famous due to Constance McMillan not being able to wear a tuxedo or take her girlfriend to the prom. About The Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition is a collaboration of people and organizations, who believe that no student should ever feel too afraid to go to school. Harassment, bullying, and unfair school policy can make schools into hostile places for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer youth or young people who are mistakenly perceived to be queer. MSSC trains students and allies to make schools safer, while fighting for long-term policy change. MSSC‚Äôs work is made possible through a grant from the Liberty Hill Foundation‚Äôs Queer Youth Fund, making MSSC the first Mississippi LGBT youth advocacy group to receive foundation funding. The MSSC actively works in numerous ways to address bullying in Mississippi schools. During their 2010 Queer Youth and Allies Summit, MSSC screened the Southern Poverty Law Center film \\"Bullied: A Student, a School and a Case That Made History.\\"http://legalclips.nsba.org/?p=3051 Mission The mission of the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition is to ensure that all students have a safe learning environment by protecting students‚Äô constitutional rights, ending homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and all forms of discrimination, and fostering acceptance of students regardless of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity through public education and advocacy.

Strain CKB is a Gram negative, facultative anaerobe belonging to the Betaproteobacteria. The cells of strain CKB are highly motile and possess a single polar flagellum. D. agitata can couple the oxidation of several electron donors such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate, succinate, fumarate, malate or yeast extract to electron acceptors such as oxygen, chlorate, perchlorate, ferrous iron, sulphide, and reduced humic substances like 2,6-anthrahydroquinone disulphonate. Unlike other perchlorate reducers, strain CKB cannot grow by nitrate reduction, which suggests that the pathways of nitrate and perchlorate reduction are distinct and unrelated, contrary to what previous research had shown. Biological perchlorate reduction by strain CKB Strain CKB can reduce chlorate and perchlorate (collectively known as (per)chlorate) completely to chloride. The first step of the pathway involves the reduction of (per)chlorate to chlorite via the perchlorate reductase (Pcr) enzyme. Chlorite is then dismutated to molecular oxygen and chloride by the chlorite dismutase (Cld) enzyme. The produced oxygen can then be reduced to water by action of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase. The Cld enzyme, encoded by an 834 bp gene, is 277 amino acids long and includes a 26 amino acid leader peptide. Though expressed at basal levels under aerobic conditions, the cld gene was transcriptionally upregulated when strain CKB cells were grown in (per)chlorate. The Cld enzyme is of particular interest not only because it protects cells from toxic chlorite, but also because it is one of only a handful of systems capable of producing molecular oxygen.

Many culture jams are intended to expose questionable political assumptions behind commercial culture. Culture jamming makes use of the technique d√©tournement, which uses the language and rhetoric of the mainstream paradigm or culture to subversively critique that paradigm or culture. Tactics include editing logos to critique the company, product, or concept they represent, or wearing fashion statements which criticize the current fashion trends by deliberately clashing with them.Boden, Sharon and Williams, Simon J. (2002) \\"Consumption and Emotion: The Romantic Ethic Revisited\\", Sociology 36(3):493‚Äì512 Culture jamming often entails using mass media to produce ironic or satirical commentary about itself, commonly using the original medium's communication method. Culture jamming is employed as a reaction against social conformity. Prominent examples of culture jamming include the adulteration of billboard advertising by the Billboard Liberation Front (BLF), and contemporary artists such as Ron English. Culture jamming may involve street parties and protests. While culture jamming usually focuses on subverting or critiquing political and advertising messages, some proponents focus on a more positive (often musically inspired) form which brings together artists, scholars, and activists to create new types of cultural production that transcend ‚Äì rather than merely criticize ‚Äì the status quo.LeVine, Mark (2005) Why They Don't Hate Us: Lifting the Veil on the Axis of Evil. Oxford, UK: Oneworld Publications. Origins of the term, etymology, and history =1984 coinage= The term was coined in 1984 by Don Joyce of the sound collage band Negativland, with the release of their album JamCon '84.Lloyd, Jan (2003) Culture Jamming: Semiotic Banditry in the Streets , in Cultural Studies Department: University of Canterbury, ChristchurcDery, Mark (2010) New Introduction and revisited edition of Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs, October 8, 2010 The phrase \\"culture jamming\\" comes from the idea of radio jamming: that public frequencies can be pirated and subverted for independent communication, or to disrupt dominant frequencies.Disrupt Dominant Frequencies In one of the tracks of the album, they stated: =Origins and preceding influences= According to Vince Carducci, although the term was coined by Negativland, culture jamming can be traced as far back as the 1950s.Carducci, Vince (2006) \\"Culture Jamming: A Sociological Perspective\\", Journal of Consumer Culture 6(1): 116‚Äì138 One particularly influential group that was active in Europe was the Situationist International and was led by Guy Debord. The SI asserted that in the past humans dealt with life and the consumer market directly. They argued that this spontaneous way of life was slowly deteriorating as a direct result of the new \\"modern\\" way of life. Situationists saw everything from television to radio as a threatLasn, Kalle (1999) Culture Jam: How to Reverse America's Suicidal Consumer Binge ‚Äì And Why We Must. New York: HarperCollins and argued that life in industrialized areas, driven by capitalist forces, had become monotonous, sterile, gloomy, linear, and productivity driven. In particular, the SI argued humans had become passive recipients of the spectacle, a simulated reality that generates the desire to consume, and positions humans as obedient consumerist cogs within the efficient and exploitative productivity loop of capitalism. Through playful activity, individuals could create situations, the opposite of spectacles. For the SI, these situations took the form of the d√©rive, or the active drift of the body through space in ways that broke routine and overcame boundaries, creating situations by exiting habit and entering new interactive possibilities. The cultural critic Mark Dery traces the origins of culture jamming to medieval carnival, which Mikhail Bakhtin interpreted, in Rabelais and his World, as an officially sanctioned subversion of the social hierarchy. Modern precursors might include: the media-savvy agit-prop of the anti-Nazi photomonteur John Heartfield, the sociopolitical street theater and staged media events of 1960s radicals such as Abbie Hoffman, Joey Skaggs, the German concept of Spa√üguerilla, and in the Situationist International (SI) of the 1950s and 1960s. The SI first compared its own activities to radio jamming in 1968, when it proposed the use of guerrilla communication within mass media to sow confusion within the dominant culture. In 1985, the Guerrilla Girls formed to expose discrimination and corruption in the art world.Mark Dery.\\"A Brief Introduction to the 2010 Reprint (open source).\\" Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of Signs Mark Dery's New York Times article on culture jamming, \\"The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax\\"Dery, Mark (1990)The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax, NYtimes article, December 23, 1990. was the first mention, in the mainstream media, of the phenomenon; Dery later expanded on this article in his 1993 Open Magazine pamphlet, Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs,Dery, Mark (1993) Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs, in Open Magazine Pamphlet Series, 1993 a seminal essay that remains the most exhaustive historical, sociopolitical, and philosophical theorization of culture jamming to date. Adbusters, a Canadian publication espousing an environmentalist critique of consumerism and advertising, began promoting aspects of culture jamming after Dery introduced founder and editor Kalle Lasn to the term through a series of articles he wrote for the magazine. In her critique of consumerism, No Logo, the Canadian cultural commentator and political activist Naomi Klein examines culture jamming in a chapter which focuses on the work of Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada. Through an analysis of the Where the Hell is Matt viral videos, researchers Milstein and Pulos analyze how the power of the culture jam to disrupt the status quo is currently being threatened by increasing commercial incorporation. For example, T-Mobile utilized the Liverpool street underground station to host a flashmob to sell their mobile services. Tactics Graffitied text on billboard in Cambridge, UK Culture jamming is a form of disruption that plays on the emotions of viewers and bystanders. Jammers want to disrupt the unconscious thought process that takes place when most consumers view a popular advertising and bring about a d√©tournement. Activists that utilize this tactic are counting on their meme to pull on the emotional strings of people and evoke some type of reaction. The reactions that most cultural jammers are hoping to evoke are behavioral change and political action. There are four emotions that activists often want viewers to feel. These emotions ‚Äì shock, shame, fear, and anger ‚Äì are believed to be the catalysts for social change.Summers-Effler, Erika (2002) \\"The Micro Potential for Social Change: Emotion, Consciousness, and Social Movement Formation\\", Sociological Theory 20(1): 41‚Äì60 The basic unit in which a message is transmitted in culture jamming is the meme. Memes are condensed images that stimulate visual, verbal, musical, or behavioral associations that people can easily imitate and transmit to others. The term meme was coined and first popularized by geneticist Richard Dawkins, but later used by cultural critics such as Douglas Rushkoff, who claimed memes were a type of media virus.Rushkoff, Douglas (1996) Media Virus! New York: Ballantine Memes are seen as genes that can jump from outlet to outlet and replicate themselves or mutate upon transmission just like a virus.Dawkins, Richard (1989) The Selfish Gene. Oxford: Oxford University Press Culture jammers will often use common symbols such as the McDonald's golden arches or Nike swoosh to engage people and force them to think about their eating habits or fashion sense.Center for Communication and Civic Engagement, Seattle, Washington Retrieved November 20, 2009 In one example, jammer Jonah Peretti used the Nike symbol to stir debate on sweatshop child labor and consumer freedom. Peretti made public exchanges between himself and Nike over a disagreement. Peretti had requested custom Nikes with the word \\"sweatshop\\" placed in the Nike symbol. Nike refused. Once this story was made public over Peretti's website, it spread worldwide and contributed to the already robust conversation, Business Insider Retrieved February 9, 2015 and dialogue about Nike's use of sweatshops, which had been ongoing for a decade prior to Peretti's 2001 stunt. Jammers can also organize and participate in mass campaigns. Examples of cultural jamming like Perretti's are more along the lines of tactics that radical consumer social movements would use. These movements push people to question the taken-for-granted assumption that consuming is natural and good and aim to disrupt the naturalization of consumer culture; they also seek to create systems of production and consumption that are more humane and less dominated by global corporate hypercapitalism.Princen, Thomas, Maniates, Michael and Conca, Ken (2002) Confronting Consumption. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. Past mass events and ideas have included \\"Buy Nothing Day\\", \\"Digital Detox Week\\", virtual sit-ins and protests over the Internet, producing ‚Äòsubvertisements' and placing them in public spaces, and creating and enacting ‚Äòplacejamming' projects where public spaces are reclaimed and nature is re- introduced into urban places.Harold, Christine (2004) \`Pranking Rhetoric: \\"Culture jamming\\" as Media Activism', Critical Studies in Media Communication 21(3): 189‚Äì211 The most effective form of jamming is to use an already widely recognizable meme to transmit the message. Once viewers are forced to take a second look at the mimicked popular meme they are forced out of their comfort zone. Viewers are presented with another way to view the meme and forced to think about the implications presented by the jammer. More often than not, when this is used as a tactic the jammer is going for shock value. For example, to make consumers aware of the negative body image that big-name fashion brands are frequently accused of causing, a subvertisement of Calvin Klein's 'Obsession' was created and played worldwide. It depicted a young woman with an eating disorder throwing up into a toilet.Bordwell, Marilyn (2002) \`Jamming Culture: Adbusters' Hip Media Campaign against Consumerism', in Thomas Princen, Michael Maniates and Ken Conca (eds) Confronting Consumption, pp. 237‚Äì53. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press Another way that social consumer movements hope to utilize culture jamming effectively is by employing a metameme. A metameme is a two-level message that punctures a specific commercial image, but does so in a way that challenges some larger aspect of the political culture of corporate domination. An example would be the \\"true cost\\" campaign set in motion by Adbusters. \\"True Cost\\" forced consumers to compare the human labor cost and conditions and environmental drawbacks of products to the sales costs. Another example would be the \\"Truth\\" campaigns that frequented television in the past years that exposed the deception tobacco companies used to sell their products. Following critical scholars like Paulo Freire, Culture jams are also being Integrated into the university classroom \\"setting in which students and teachers gain the opportunity not only to learn methods of informed public critique, but also to collaboratively use participatory communication techniques to actively create new locations of meaning.\\" For example, students disrupt public space to bring attention to community concerns or utilize subvertisments to engage with media literacy projects. =Examples= * Artivist * Billboard hacking * Broadcast signal intrusion * Flash mob * Happening * Practical joke topics * Steal This Book ;Groups * Guerrilla Girls * The Yes Men * Billboard Liberation Front * Crimethinc * Merry Pranksters * Operation Mindfuck * Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions Criticism Culture jamming is sometimes confused with artistic appropriation or with acts of vandalism which have destruction or defacement as their primary goal. Although the end result is not always easily distinguishable from these activities, the intent of those participating in culture jamming differs from that of people whose intent is either artistic or merely destructive. The lines are not always clear-cut; some activities, notably street art, will fall into two or even all three categories. With the rise of the anti-corporate globalization movement at the turn of the century the possibilities as well as limits of culture jamming as originally conceived have become apparent. The joyful images of \\"Teamsters and Turtles\\" during the iconic November 1999 anti-WTO protests in Seattle, Washington and the clowns and samba bands as well as highly inventive music and art generated in subsequent protests showed the possibilities of culture jamming to amplify both critical messages and solidarity among protesters and with the broader public. On the other hand, especially after the September 11 attacks and the rise but ultimate failure of the anti-Iraq war movement the limits of the understanding and deployment of culture jamming primarily as a tool of defense and critique‚Äî\\"jamming\\" the messages of the corporate/military system‚Äîbecame increasingly apparent. This coincided with a realization among critical members of the emerging global peace and justice movement of the inherent (if largely unnoticed and unacknowledged) myopia and prejudices against Middle Eastern/Muslim and other marginalized non-Euro- American cultures and communities by the movement, a realization that became an important issue of contention within the World Social Forums first held in 2001. In that regard, some scholars and activists argue that culture jamming is easily co-opted and commodified by the market, which tends to \\"defuse\\" its potential for consumer resistance.Rumbo, Joseph D. (2002) \\"Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters\\", Psychology & Marketing 19(2): 127‚Äì48. Others posit that the culture jamming strategy of rhetorical sabotage, used by Adbusters, is easily incorporated and appropriated by clever advertising agencies, and thus is not a very powerful means of social change. More positively, some practitioners have called for moving beyond the negative sense of \\"jamming\\" to the more positive, musical understanding of the term that would encourage artists, scholars and activists to come together and literally \\"jam\\" in the best musical sense of the term‚Äîto synergize and in so doing augment and amplify their experiences and ideas to create new, innovative, flexible and praxically mobile art, intellectual and political concepts, strategies and actions that together would offer deeper, more compelling and even transformational visions of futures in which, as the Zapatistas have taught, many worlds are possible.

It is located in the southwest area of Siargao Island. There is no political entity for Dapa Poblacion. Instead, the area is constituted of thirteen barangays. A barangay is the basic and lowest political entity in Filipino society. In some cases, barangays are villages and towns. The National Statistical Coordination Board, an agency of the Philippine government, lists three urban barangays and nine rural barangays of the municipality of Dapa that are where the poblacion is located. These are Barangays 1 through 13. Their total population (as of August 1, 2007), was 9,162 persons. The population of the entire municipality was 22,184 people.National Statistical Coordination Board website, http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc ; Greg Bloom, Michael Grosberg, Virginia Jealous and Piers Kelly, Lonely Planet: Philippines (Footscray, Australia: Lonely Planet, May 2009), 10th ed., p.377. To surfers, Dapa is an important stop on their way to the surfing areas around Cloud Nine and General Luna. Also, a number of tourists pass through Dapa to visit swimming areas and to participate in deep-sea fishing. This said, Siargao Island is not a trussed up tourist spot. Very little has been done to accommodate tourists, as most surfers are used to making do with very little available. Dapa and the Siargao Island Airport are the only entry points to reach the surfing, swimming and deep-sea fishing areas. As the ticket fees for flying are rather steep, most people reach the island through Dapa. A ferry comes from Surigao City, on the northeastern tip of Mindanao, twice a day, landing at the port at Dapa. The return ferry also leaves Dapa twice a day.Bloom, Grosberg, Jealous and Kelly, pp. 377-8; William C. Pollard, Jr., interview with Jack L. Ferreras, Dapa township, Philippines, October 27, 2010. Origins of Dapa In the 1800s, when the Philippines was still under Spanish rule, Moro pirates occasionally raided the coastal villages of Siargao Island. They left behind death and destruction. Often villagers were captured and forced into slavery. Along the south coast of the island, villagers sought refuge in the place that is now Dapa. The area was heavily wooded and tall mangrove formations, extending into the coastal waters, protected the area. At the north end of the modern poblacion is a tall hill, where the refugees could see kilometers into the distance. From their vantage point the refugees could see pirates coming and had time to hide. The refugees usually lay prone on the ground, called hapa in the native tongue. The name Dapa is a corrupted usage of \\"hapa.\\" The new inhabitants of the refugee village adapted the name \\"Dapa\\" to remind them of the Moro raids. Thus Dapa became a permanent settlement.Surigaoislands.com website, http://surigaoislands.com/dapa_history.html . Demographics Virtually the entire population of Dapa is Filipino. There are some foreigners visiting from Europe, Australia, Japan and the United States, mostly visiting the area en route to the surfing areas around General Luna. The Siargo.com website says three percent of the town's population are foreigners. Most of the population speaks English and most speak Tagalog. Many also speak other languages native to the Philippines, such as Visayan. Religious Institutions Most people of Dapa are Roman Catholic. A large Catholic church, Santo Nino, is located in the northeastern area of the township. A nondenominational Christian church, the Word of God Church, is located in the business district, to the south of town. Dapa also has a number of Moslems.Siargao.com website, http://siargao.com/article.php?article=8&at;=2 ; Economy Dapa is a very remote area. Its economy seems very self- sufficient. Electricity is available everywhere and most houses and buildings have electricity. Residences range from very primitive to small, very basic houses built of block and on concrete slabs. A few residences are larger and more substantial. Very few houses are air conditioned. There is no land line telephone service, but many residents and businesses make use of mobile phones. Also, there is cable television and internet service available. At present Dapa is served by a small fifty-bed hospital (Siargao District Hospital), a dental clinic and several pharmacies. However, plans are underway to vastly expand the hospital.Siargao.com website; Nursingcrib.com website, http://nursingcrib.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Hospitals/caraga.pdf ; Philippine Hospital Association website, http://pha.ph/members_reg13.htm . The central business district starts on the port side on the south and goes about four blocks to the north. It is about six blocks wide. A block north of the ferry landing is the town square, essentially a large parking lot, around which various shops are located. Lines of motorized tricycles (see Motorized tricycle (Philippines)) and jeepneys traveling to other locations on Siargao Island are located along the east and west sides of the square. There are various types of stores and a few bakeries and restaurants. Tiny sari sari stores are located throughout the town. Dapa has two small pension hotels and 1 big pension house available, MNRB Pension House (on the north of the business district) and Mem's Pensionne Hauz and Restaurant (near the ferry and boat landing).

Transport Transportation within Dapa is done by foot or pedal tricycles, also known as pedicabs, or motorized tricycles. There are no taxicabs in Dapa. Transportation to other locations on the island is made by jeepney, motorized tricycle or motorcycle. Motorcycles have a roof built over them and can accommodate several passengers. They are known locally as habal-habal. The main roads in Dapa are paved and decently maintained. Some lesser streets are rocked or of dirt, but all seem maintained. The main road north is well maintained. The road leading to Giwan and Union (see Giwan, Surigao del Norte and Union, Surigao del Norte) for the most part is rough and in poor shapeBloom, Grosberg, Jealous and Kelly, p. 378. To reach Dapa, most persons use the ferry service from Surigao. Two ferries, run by Montenegro Shipping Lines, arrive daily and they leave daily. Also, Cebu Pacific flies to the Siargao Airport, well to the north of Dapa, but the air fare is very costly.Bloom, Grosberg, Jealous and Kelly, pp. 376, 378. Communications Dapa, as said earlier, has no land line telephone service. However, a large communications tower on a hill on the north side of town allows for mobile phone service, cable television and internet service.

Early life and education  In 1950 Rubin graduated the Shomryia High-School in Kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. She is a member of Kibbutz Bet Zera, in the Jordan Valley, where she lives and has her studio. As a mother of four and having worked in different sectors of the Kibbutz, she went to study sculpture with sculptor Yaakov Epstein, in the Plastic Arts Academy of Bat-Yam. A few years later she completed further studies with sculptor Dalia Mei'ri at Emek Yizrael College. During her career, she has received several Israeli art awards.  Media  At present she uses a variety of formative arts methods to express herself, mainly bronze sculptures, as well as wood and marble sculptures, \\"Relief Painting\\", \\"Soft Painting\\" technique, wool tapestries and fantastic black painted creatures' images on natural white plywood boards. Career Rubin is a member of the Israeli Union of Painters & Sculptors and the Kibbutz Movement's Artists Association; she had a number of solo exhibitions, participated in many groups exhibitions in Israel and other countries; her works can be found in many private collections worldwide. On April 1989, hotelier Leon Taman hosted the then Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco de Mita and his Minister of Foreign Affairs Giulio Andreotti at the Hotel Daniel and presented them with Rubin's sculpture Dove of Peace. Works Rubin's bronze sculptures explore a variety of human issues, like adolescence, duality, femininity, fertility, parenthood, life in a rural area and worries- free childhood in Nature; from observation of natural processes and forms vis- a-vis their parallels in human life she created sculptures representing sprouting, growth, flowering, ripening, decay and continuity of life. Other series represent the erotic character common to Flora and humans. In recent years she tends to work on subjects like inter-human relationships, closeness and separation, oddities and socially acceptable, close-by and far-away, giving artistic expression to accumulating emotions, transmission of sentiments and feelings between spouses, longings for relationship and love of the family. Relief Painting is a kind of a flat sculpture. It is a unique technique, developed by Rubin, that uses various and different materials. With this technique she expresses, in a sensitive plastic forms, her feelings towards her surroundings. The contrasts between the artist and her human milieu create conflicts that, being stormy, hard and unsolved has a lot of influence on the forming of the work. In Soft Painting - sheaves of colored fibers laid on a felt sheet replaces the brush and palette of the painter. Once the 'painting' is finished the combination of forms and colors is stapled to the sheet of felt with a special instrument. The results - big pictures, abstract in nature or of imaginary creatures in magic atmosphere ‚Äì are rich in colors and forms.

He fought to improve the working prospects and conditions of African Americans in the shipyards, grocery stores, housing, police and fire departments in Long Beach. He was a co-founder of the Long Beach chapter of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Like Martin Luther King Jr., McBride employed Mahatma Gandhi's model of peaceful protest to achieve civil rights gains. He became a target of the FBI's COINTELPRO, which targeted many of the country's civil rights organizations and leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. - most famously resulting in the FBI - King Suicide Letter. McBride's legacy is memorialized in numerous awards, historic land marking of his home, and the naming of a high school and park. Early life and education Mural in Long Beach depicting Ernest and Lillian McBride McBride was born on November 20, 1909, one of seven children of a Mississippi Delta farmer. There were no schools for black people in Mississippi so, at age 8, the family moved to Arkansas so that the children could attend school. In Little Rock, Arkansas, McBride and his siblings attended segregated schools. While still in school, he witnessed a white mob drag a black man to death behind an automobile, then set the man on fire. At the all-black Scipio A. Jones High School, McBride first learned about Mahatma Gandhi's model for peaceful protest of injustice. McBride graduated from Scipio A. Jones High School in 1930. Career Painting of Ernest McBride Sr. by granddaughter Saam McBride-Adams, on display at Ernest McBride High School McBride played briefly with the Memphis Red Sox in the Negro National League, but soon headed to California in search of better jobs and higher wages. When he arrived in Long Beach in 1930, he found the city as segregated as Little Rock. His first job there was working on an all-black crew loading cotton onto ships in San Pedro Harbor. McBride discovered that his crew was making less than the previous workers‚ÄîLatinos, who had been fired after asking for raise. McBride quit the job to fight to unionize shipyard workers, regardless of race. While working at a Ralph's grocery store in 1932, McBride became a union organizer for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). He organized the Ralph's employees, who picketed the store until it signed an agreement with the employees. McBride served for five years on the CIO grievance committee and was authorized to represent any government employee west of the Mississippi River. He worked to get blacks hired in the City of Long Beach's Trash, Police, and Fire Departments. In 1940, McBride and his wife Lillian decided to try and form a Long Beach branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). They recruited Roscoe Hayes, L.J. Jones, and Nathan Holly and held the organizational meetings at the McBrides home, under the watchful eye of the police. With the assistance of the Reverend Willy Lomax of the Second Baptist Church, who made an appeal to his congregation, they were able to raise sufficient funds and membership to be accepted as an official chapter of the NAACP. Among the many injustices he fought were attempts to bar him and his wife, also active in the movement, from purchasing a home on Lemon Avenue in Long Beach in 1948. When restrictive covenants and a petition by white neighbors to keep his family out might have stopped another man, McBride persevered, and not only bought the bungalow but raised his six children there. The house became a regular meeting place for civil rights activists. In the 1950s, McBride and his wife hosted receptions at their home for Eslande Goode Robeson, wife of Paul Robeson, while Mr. Robeson performed at a fundraising event for the Long Beach NAACP, and Margarita Belafonte, wife of Harry Belafonte‚ÄîAfrican-American luminaries and activists at the time.Nash, Sunny, Fighting for the People. Belmont, 2007, pp.92-93 The McBride home was designated a historical landmark by the Long Beach City Council in 1994. By then, McBride had become a local legend. Having co-founded the Long Beach Chapter of the NAACP, he successfully fought to integrate the Long Beach Police Department, the Long Beach Fire Dept., Ralph's grocery stores, the naval shipyard and General Telephone Co. He organized a student revolt (including two of his own children) to force local officials to abandon blackface minstrel shows. From 1948 to 1972, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) maintained surveillance of McBride.Nash, Sunny, Fighting for the People. Belmont, pp. 130-132 The FBI was concerned that civil rights leaders had communist sympathies or ties, and conducted surveillance and covert activities against civil rights leaders and organizations as part of its COINTELPRO program. Death and legacy Ernest McBride Sr. died in 2007 at the age of 97. In addition to the historical landmark designation of his home, Long Beach's Ernest S. McBride Sr. High School, Ernest McBride Skate Park, and Ernest McBride community center are all named in his honor.

She was a pioneer in the field of children's health, and was instrumental in the establishment of children's health camps in New Zealand. Biography Gunn was born in Dunedin, the daughter of an ironmonger whose interests in medicine led him to change career initially to pharmacy and then to dentistry. She attended Timaru and Otago Girls' High Schools, and from there went to the University of Otago. After a year at Otago she left for Scotland, completing her medical qualifications at Edinburgh Medical School in 1903, and then taking postgraduate studies in obstetrics at Dublin University. Gunn in uniform as a captain in the New Zealand Medical Corps, 1917 After completing her studies, Gunn returned to New Zealand, working as a general practitioner in Wellington before joining the school medical service in 1912. From 1915 to 1917, she was a captain in the New Zealand Medical Corps (NZMC), having succeeded in gaining admission to a predominantly male preserve by her formidable force of character: upon initially failing to gain admittance to the NZMC she took her case directly to Prime Minister William Massey, claiming that this snubbing was injurious to her reputation in medical circles. She served during World War I with the NZMC at Trentham and then on the troopship Tahiti. On her return to new Zealand she continued to work at Trentham, but her own health suffered and she came down with a rheumatic condition. During her convalescence Gunn travelled, ending up in Britain in 1917. Here she visited child welfare institutions, and became acutely aware of the problems of child malnutrition. On returning to New Zealand she rejoined the school medical service, serving in the southwestern North Island. During her time in this service, based at Wanganui, she became a much feared but much respected character. Gunn was infamous for her habit of removing children's loose or rotten teeth with a spatula. \\"The doctor is in the habit of removing portions of decayed teeth by means of the spatula used for depressing the tongue. The doctor refrained from doing this after I had protested\\" (George Kidson, Headmaster, Kilbirnie School, 6 July 1922).School log book. ref no. 91-355-2/03, Alexander Turnbull LIbrary. https://tiaki.natlib.govt.nz/#details=ecatalogue.127082 Gunn's most notable contribution to children's health was the inauguration of the Children's Health Camp movement. Based on the system of open-air schools used in Britain to aid tuberculosis sufferers, Gunn proposed to Wanganui Hospital Board member B.P. Lethbridge that a simplified system of camps for malnourished children would improve child health. She and Lethbridge had a wager as to the success of such a scheme, and Gunn set about using her persuasive powers in gaining the necessary equipment to open a camp. In November 1919, 55 children arrived at Turakina to spend three weeks under the supervision of Gunn and a small group of school nurses and teacher trainees. Gunn continued to personally organise and run camps throughout the 1920s, at Turakina and later at Awapuni, Palmerston North. Her last camp was held at Awapuni Racecourse in 1930. Camps were organised on a military-like schedule, creating an atmosphere that was somewhere between an open-air hospital and a scout camp. Other voluntary health camps started up, and in 1936, a National Federation of Health Camps was inaugurated, with permanent, year-round facilities and substantial government subsidies, some of these coming through the sale of health stamps, postage stamps with a set charity premium which went towards the running of the camps. Between 1937 and 1940, Gunn served as director of the Health Department's Division of School Hygiene, succeeding Ada Gertrude Paterson. She retired from the Division of School Hygiene on 31 March 1940. After retiring from the post she continued to be interested and to work in the fields of child health and paediatrics. Gunn was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 King's Birthday Honours for her work in child health. Gunn died at Ranui rest home in Wellington on 26 October 1963.

Before the current establishment, Tanzania has had three constitutions: the Independence Constitution (1961), the Republican Constitution (1962), and the Interim Constitution of the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar (1964).See Ituo Cha Katiba History =Independence Constitution (1961-1962)= After independence from the United Kingdom, Tanganyika adopted a first constitution based on the Westminster Model (with the exclusion of the Bill of Rights). This defined a Governor General who represented the Queen of Tanganyika, Elizabeth II, to be the formal head of state. The executive was led by the First Minister or the Prime Minister, chosen from the majority party. The constitution also established the independence of the judiciary. =Republican Constitution (1962-1964)= In 1962, the Tanzanian Parliament (made solely of nominees from the Tanganyika African National Union party) formed itself into a constituent assembly and drastically revised the 1961 constitution, most notably with the establishment of a strongly presidential system. The new President of Tanzania was granted the prerogatives of both former roles, Governor General and First Minister, serving as the head of state as well as commander in chief of the armed forces. He was granted the right to designate the vice president and Ministers, and the right to dismiss the Parliament under certain circumstances. The President also inherited security-related, repressive powers that were formerly of the Governor General, with the addition of new ones; the Preventive Detention Act, for example, gave the President the right to detain any person without trial. =Interim Constitution (1964-1977)= In 1964, Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged into the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, renamed into \\"United Republic of Tanzania\\" that same year. The constitution of the newborn nation was based on Tanganyika's 1962 Republican Constitution, modified according to the agreements between TANU and Zanzibar's majority party, the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP). These agreements had been ratified under the name \\"Articles of Union\\", and became part of the new constitution as \\"Acts of Union\\". The most notable feature of the Acts of Union was the establishment of the double government structure that is also part of Tanzania's current constitution. This structure included one government for the Union and one largely autonomous independent government for Zanzibar. Zanzibar's government included its own Parliament and President. The President of Zanzibar also served as vice president of the Union. The constitution of 1964 was adopted ad interim. The Acts of Union themselves included directions on steps to take to elaborate a definitive constitution, to be elaborated by a constituent assembly comprising representatives of both TANU and ASP. This procedure was initiated but was later suspended. Changes in 1965 The Interim Constitution was modified several times after its first layout. A major change was made in 1965 to formalize the one-party nature of the Tanzanian government. Coherent to the double government structure defined in 1964, the 1965 Constitution identified two government parties, TANU for the Union and ASP for Zanzibar. In the following years, several amendments were added. Those reduced the autonomy of Zanzibar and further strengthened the one-party state. For example, an amendment in 1975 established that all the government institutions, including the Parliament, were subordinate to the party's executive committee. At that time, TANU and ASP were about to merge into the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), something that happened in 1977. The Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania as further Amended (Fourth) Constitution (1977-today One month after CCM was founded, the Permanent Constitution was approved. This Constitution essentially confirmed the main principles of the Republic and Interim Constitutions, i.e., strong presidency, dual government structure, one-party state. Since 1977, several amendments have been applied to the original Constitution. Many of these are related to the relationship between the united government and the Zanzibar government. In the early 1990s, President of the Union Ali Hassan Mwinyi launched a program of liberal reforms. He nominated a commission (named Nyalali Commission after its president Francis Nyalali) dedicated to preparing the transition to a multi-party political system. Based on the commission's works, several amendments were promulgated. The Eighth Amendment (1992) established that a member of any registered political party could run for any political seat; coherently, new rules were defined governing the parties' registration. The Ninth Amendment reorganized presidential elections and introduced the possibility of impeachment by the Parliament; further, it separated the functions of President and Prime Minister. The relationships between Zanzibar and the Union were also modified over time. For example, the Eleventh Amendment established the President of Zanzibar and the Union vice president as two different, independent roles. April 2000: The Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment It introduced the following changes: \\\\- Prior, a candidate needed 50% of votes in presidential elections to be declared president of the United Republic; only a simple majority is now required to be declared president. \\\\- Before, the President had no power to nominate any body to parliament all members of parliament except the Attorney General, women in special seats and representatives of the Zanzibar House, were elected form constituencies. The Constitutional amendment allowed the President to nominate up to 10 members of parliament. \\\\- Increased the number of special seats from women from 15%- 20%, depending on the declaration of the National Electoral Commission from time to time, with the consent of the president.

This order of battle includes all combat units, including engineer and artillery units, but not medical, supply, signal and border guard units. Background After the First Battle of √áatalca the Bulgarian and Ottoman governments concluded an armistice on and agreed to attend a peace conference in London. For almost a month the talks at St. James's Palace achieved very little when on the Young Turks, led by Enver Bey staged a coup and seized power in Constantinople.Hall (2000),p. 78-79 The new government was determined to hold on to Adrianople at all costs, a position which Bulgaria viewed as unacceptable and led to the denouncement of the armistice on 16 of January 1913.Hall (2000),p. 78-79 With the initiative in their hands and with a renewed sense of confidence in their war leaders and in their ability to successfully fight the Bulgarians, the Ottomans decided to execute an offensive plan that was devised in mid December 1912. Leaving their small remaining forces in Epirus and Albania on their own the Ottomans focused entirely on the Thracian Theater where they planned a full-scale, corps level, amphibious invasion on the western shore of the Sea of Marmara was to be attempted with simultaneous attacks by the provisional corps on the Gallipoli Peninsula and the √áatalca Army, while the Adrianople garrison and conducted diversionary attacks.Erickson (2003), p.253. Bulgarian preparations During the armistice the Bulgarians took several important measures to improve their strategic and tactical situation in Thrace. As early as December 1912 they realized that the rear of their Second Army at Adrianople or of their First and Third Armies could have easily been threatened by a large Ottoman offensive using the Gallipoli Peninsula as its staging point. To counter this threat the Bulgarian high command decided to transfer all its forces that were previously fighting on the Western Theater as they had fulfilled their objectives there and on 15 of December 1912 formed the new Fourth Army.Erickson (2003), p.255.

It was one of many incidents at the time involving armed Chinese firing on foreign vessels. Background At the beginning of World War I, the European nations with flotillas on the Yangtze withdrew their vessels to reinforce their fleets in Europe. This left the Yangtze Patrol with the only Western naval presence on the river. China was initially a neutral country during the war, as was the United States. But when the American government declared war on Germany in April 1917, a now belligerent flotilla of American ships occupied the neutral Chinese waters. As a result, the Yangtze Patrol was interned at Shanghai. The attack on Monocacy occurred in January 1918, just after the Yangtze Patrol was released from internment upon China's declaration of war on Germany. Though America and China were allies, skirmishes between armed Chinese and foreigners became more and more common and would continue long after World War I. Lieutenant Harvey Delano of Monocacy received news that Chinese soldiers had fired on several foreign vessels in the area so in response, bags of coal were piled on deck to provide cover for the sailors on patrol. Incident While steaming through the river roughly north of Chenglin at exactly 09:00 on 17 January, the 200 long ton (200 tonne) Monocacy was fired on from both sides of the river by Chinese troops ashore. Delano quickly ordered his men to alter course and raise the largest American flag aboard. The first shot struck the jackstaff and was followed by a volley from an estimated 200 rifles. Two shots hit the bridge, so at 09:01 the Americans returned fire with small arms. Chinese forces were spread out for along the river and their shots increased as the Americans continued on, but by 09:05 most of the rifles were silent, except for some sporadic sniping. Chief Yeoman Harold LeRoy O'Brien was hit by one of these sporadic shots and fell to the deck dead. Because of this, the skipper ordered his men to return fire with the battery of 6-pounders at 09:25, and five minutes later all was quiet. After shooting only six or seven shells and about 3,000 bullets, the attackers retreated. Monocacy was hit about eighty times and two American sailors were wounded by Chinese fire, one of them seriously. During the engagement, a Japanese steamer was heading downriver and was fired on, but the Americans prevented her from being damaged by providing covering fire. The incidents of Chinese troops firing on foreign vessels were quickly brought to the attention of the western population of China. Protests broke out in Shanghai, which ultimately forced the Chinese government to make an apology and pay $25,000 to the United States. The money was eventually given to the wife of Chief Yeoman O'Brien and the affair was settled. Both of the wounded sailors received $500.Tolley, p. 81‚Äì82.

The group was founded in 2002. In 2005, it reportedly had between 150 and 200 members and one employee; in 2016 it reportedly had 500 physician members. The group's primary focus is advocating against abortion and the adoption of children by gay or lesbian people. It also advocates conversion therapy. The organization's view on parenting differs from the position of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which holds that sexuality has no connection with the ability to be a good parent and to raise healthy and well-adjusted children. ACPeds has been listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for \\"pushing anti-LGBT junk science\\". A number of mainstream researchers, including the director of the US National Institutes of Health, have accused ACPeds of misusing or mischaracterizing their work to advance ACPeds' political agenda.  Founding and membership  The group was founded in 2002 by a group of pediatricians, including Joseph Zanga, a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as a protest against the AAP's support for adoption by gay couples. ACPeds reports its membership at \\"over 500 physicians and other healthcare professionals\\".  Positions  ACPeds has vehemently condemned the American Psychological Association as a ‚Äúgay-affirming program‚Äù which ‚Äúdevalues self-restraint,‚Äù and supports ‚Äúa child‚Äôs autonomy from the authority of both family and religion, and from the limits and norms these institutions place on children.‚Äù ACPeds also has adopted positions strongly opposed to parental affirmation and medical interventions in support of non-traditional or transgender gender identities in children.  Publications  In response to the publication by the medical and professional organization American Academy of Pediatrics of Just the Facts, a handbook on teen sexual orientation aimed at a school audience, ACPeds issued its own publication, Facts About Youth, in March 2010, accompanied by a web site. Facts About Youth, along with a cover letter, was mailed to 14,800 school superintendents on behalf of Tom Benton, president of ACPeds. Facts About Youth was challenged as not acknowledging the scientific and medical evidence regarding sexual orientation, sexual identity, sexual health, or effective health education by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The ACPeds letter to the superintendents primarily addressed same-sex attraction, and recommended that \\"well-intentioned but misinformed school personnel\\" who encourage students to \\"come out as gay\\" and affirm them as such may lead the students into \\"harmful homosexual behaviors that they otherwise would not pursue.\\" The ACPeds letter to the superintendents also stated that gender dysphoria will typically disappear by puberty \\"if the behavior is not reinforced\\" and similarly alleged that \\"most students (over 85 percent) with same-sex attractions will ultimately adopt a heterosexual orientation if not otherwise encouraged.\\"  Reception  Some scientists have voiced concerns that ACPeds mischaracterized or misused their work to advance its political agenda. Gary Remafedi, a pediatrician at the University of Minnesota, wrote ACPeds a public letter accusing them of fundamentally mischaracterizing his research in their publications to argue that schools should deny support to gay teenagers. Francis Collins, a geneticist and director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), issued a statement through the NIH accusing the ACPeds of misleading children and parents on its Facts About Youth website. Warren Throckmorton, a therapist who specializes in sexual orientation issues, similarly stated that his research had been misused, saying of ACPeds: \\"They say they're impartial and not motivated by political or religious concerns, but if you look at who they're affiliated with and how they're using the research, that's just obviously not true.\\" In an amicus brief regarding the removal of a child from the foster home of a same-sex couple (Kutil and Hess v West Virginia) the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) described ACPeds as a \\"small and marginal group\\" which was \\"out of step with the research-based position of the AAP and other medical and child welfare authorities.\\" The LGBT advocacy organization PFLAG categorizes the ACPeds as an anti-equality organization, describing the group as a \\"small splinter group of medical professionals who do not support the mainstream view of the American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) that homosexuality is a normal aspect of human diversity.\\" The American College of Pediatricians has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a \\"hate group\\", and a \\"fringe group\\" which closely collaborates with the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) with \\"a history of propagating damaging falsehoods about LGBT people, including linking homosexuality to pedophilia\\". In response to an ACPeds brief, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) wrote that ACPeds is a fringe group that has acted to promote \\"unscientific and harmful 'reparative therapies' for LGBTQ students.\\" Surgical oncologist David Gorski has said that statements from ACPeds have been used by quack sites like Natural News to push anti-vaccine agenda. Gorski has pointed out that organizations spreading misinformation regarding HPV vaccine often cite ACPed. Gorski states, \\"Antivaccinationists have a special hatred for Gardasil. That hatred seems to be based on the fact that HPV vaccines are used to prevent a sexually-transmitted virus, the rationale somehow being that the use of such a vaccine will \\"encourage promiscuity.\\" It's even been called the \\"promiscuity vaccine\\". Never mind that the evidence is quite clear that this claim is simply not true. Never mind that anyone who remembers their own adolescence clearly would know that fear of catching HPV and then developing cervical cancer 20 or 30 years down the road is not a major concern among teens as their hormones rage. None of this matters to the people making these claims, however.\\" See also * American Pediatric Society * Academic Pediatric Association References External links * * Heritage Foundation panelist accidentally acknowledges research affirming transgender kids ‚Äì ThinkProgress, the executive director of ACPeds (Michelle Cretella) attempts to discredit the mainstream research on transgender identities Category:Anti-abortion organizations in the United States Category:Conservative organizations in the United States Category:Organizations that oppose LGBT rights in the United States ","title":"American College of Pediatricians"},{"id":"29547747","text":"Epicephala acrobaphes is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

The institute has been resident for thirty years at Harvard University in the Loeb Drama Center. It is a top international professional training programhttps://www.collegexpress.com/lists/list/the-best-mfa-theater-programs- in-the-country-acting/2641/ which lasts for two years (five semesters) including a three-month residency at the Moscow Art Theatre School in Moscow, Russia. The most recent program director was Scott Zigler.https://www.uncsa.edu/news/20170626-scott-zigler-drama-dean.aspx New York University director and acting teacher Marcus Stern and Julia Smeliansky, alumnus of the Moscow Art Theatre School, administer the Harvard master classes with Russian master teacher and film star Igor Zolotivitsky (Esteemed Artist of Russia) and dean of the Moscow Art Theatre School and Bulgakov scholar (People's Artist of Soviet Union) Anatoly Smeliansky. The program accepts about 22 students per year in Acting, Dramaturgy and Theatre Studies, and Voice and Speech who learn both through classroom activities and numerous opportunities for stage-experience including Institute productions as well as direct involvement in American Repertory Theatre productions. , recent Institute productions have included Young Jean Lee's The Shipment, Moira Buffini's Dying for It, and a stage adaptation of They Shoot Horses, Don't They?. In addition to performances during the students' academic year, graduating second year students also put on a set of showcase performances to aid their transition into professional work. they are presented in New York City, NY, and Los Angeles, CA. Up until 2003, the institute also hosted a well-respected Directing program, and formerly offered a Playwriting program as well.  History  Lacking a department of drama or even a drama concentration, Harvard was understandably reluctant to accept a graduate professional school of drama on the Yale model. When the A.R.T. came to Harvard from Yale in 1979, Robert Brustein originally proposed such a model for actors, directors, and dramaturgs connected to the theater and were quickly advised that the idea would never fly. It wasn't until 1987, after noting the incidence at Harvard of institutes (e.g. the Nieman and the Bunting Institutes), that Brustein submitted the proposal again, under the name of the American Repertory Theater Institute for Advanced Theater Training. Brustein was permitted to develop a training program in acting, directing, and dramaturgy. Current students receive a Master of Liberal Arts from Harvard Extension School and a Certificate of Achievement from the Moscow Art Theater School, which became associated with the school in 1997. Until 2016, students received a Master of Fine Artshttps://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/7/28/art-institute-shutter-three- years/. The institute's acting program is an intensive combination of classroom exploration and practical production experience. Acting students follow a two-year sequence carefully designed to help them incrementally increase their knowledge of and facility with text analysis, character development, spontaneity and impulse, period and aesthetic style, and overall expressiveness. =Suspension of admissions= In January 2017, the institute announced they would not be taking on any new admissions for the next academic year after the United States Department of Education gave the graduate program a failing grade due to the oppressive levels of student debt. In June 2017, the institute's director, Scott Zigler, announced he was taking the job as the dean of the School of Drama at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. In July 2017, the graduate-level theater training program announced they would be taking a three-year hiatus of accepting new admissions and they would be working on a strategic plan for the school. In the announcement, Director Zigler said, ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre looking at is taking a three-year hiatus so we can come back stronger, better, and with better funding.‚Äù Harvard University reported that the median debt for a student graduating from the two-year program in 2016 was approximately $78,000 with an average starting salary of $36,000 a year.  Program  In July of the first year, students study the Stanislavsky System as a foundation for their graduate acting training. This early training with teachers from the Moscow Art Theatre School focuses on concentration, imagination, observation, relaxation, and action analysis of a text. Classes combine extensive exercises, structured improvisations (also known as √©tudes), and textual analysis to help students form a cohesive whole out of their training. The Russian teachers also discuss the artistic and professional ethics of acting, sharing the philosophies of theater that have come to characterize the Russian tradition. In the fall of the first year, students focus on the work of Sanford Meisner and the acting theory developed by David Mamet and William H. Macy known as Practical Aesthetics. This work is designed to help students replace intellectual ideas with impulsive and spontaneous choices engendered by focus on and responsiveness to the actor's partner within an analytic framework. Classes also explore approaches to freeing the students‚Äô creativity and imagination and expanding their range of behaviour in order to create the capability to play a broad range of characters and styles. Fall and winter classes involve extensive scene study, with the primary focus on contemporary work. In the winter, students are introduced to ‚Äúoutside/ in‚Äù work: generating character through physical and vocal choices first, followed by internal character choices. Also in the first year, students are encouraged to hone their time management skills. By taking on the demanding conservatory schedule of the institute, students are readied for the scheduling demands of life as a working actor. All acting classes and workshops are closely integrated with training in voice, speech, and movement. These combined skills provide each actor with a number of approaches for conquering the myriad challenges they are likely to encounter as professional actors. In the spring of the first year, students travel to Moscow for a three-month residency at the Moscow Art Theatre School developing a play to be performed on the Moscow Art Theatre stage. In Moscow, students continue their training in acting, movement, ballet, fencing, acrobatics, singing and voice with Russian master teachers. They have the opportunity to see world theater and immerse themselves in the Stanislavsky System. They also continue studying speech and verse with their Harvard teachers. Students present and perform weekly their first production, an ensemble piece at the American Studio of the Moscow Art Theatre School. In the second year, back in residence at the A.R.T., students focus on applying skills learned in the first year to a wide variety of styles and genres both on stage and in the classroom. Classes focus on a variety of acting challenges presented by writers such as Tennessee Williams, August Wilson, and Samuel Beckett. Students also focus on contemporary heightened text by playwrights such as Suzan-Lori Parks and Mac Wellman, and spend three weeks on intensive Shakespearean scene study with acting teacher David Hammond. Students perform in Institute productions directed by faculty members and guest artists. In some instances, students will also have opportunities to perform and understudy in A.R.T.‚Äôs professional productions. Students may also perform in staged readings or workshops of new scripts being developed by the theater and the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University. Because both the American Repertory Theater and the Moscow Art Theatre School are major international institutions, Institute students gain a unique perspective on world theater. Students are encouraged to use this perspective to define their own place in the professional community. As part of an ongoing curriculum on the business of acting integrated into their entire two-year program, students are trained in on-camera and voice-over techniques, as well as having meetings with agents, casting directors, and other entertainment professionals. In the spring of the second year, graduating actors give a showcase presentation in New York and Los Angeles for artistic directors, freelance directors, casting directors, and agents.

Career In the 1990s, Lin was a member of Taiwan-based girl group 3EP Beauties () under the stage-name \\"E-Lin\\" (), along with \\"Jin\\" () and \\"Tin-Tin\\" (). One music video of theirs, \\"All Right\\", in which all three members wore bikinis, attracted considerable attention at the time; however, the group later dissolved. In 2002, Lin made her only appearance on the silver screen, in Ho Ping's movie The Rule of the Game; she played the role of a married woman who has an affair with a frequent customer at her hot pot restaurant, played by . For her role in the film, credited as \\"Wei Ling\\", she won the \\"Best New Actress\\" award at the 47th Asia-Pacific Film Festival in Seoul. Lin had made plans to leave Taiwan and move to South Korea to attempt to break into the K-pop industry; however, her nude sex scene in The Rule of the Game, a departure from her \\"pure and cute\\" image as a member of 3EP Beauties, caused her difficulties in this regard and forced her to delay her plans. She finally moved to South Korea in 2007 to work with the talent management agency AntzStar (), run by South Korean actor . There, she faced grueling conditions, including 15-hour days filled with rehearsals. She claims to have had to take injections of painkillers every two weeks in order to find relief from knee pain caused by dancing for five hours straight each day. Unable to bear the pressure, Lin aimed to go back home, but claims that her management company held her prisoner in her house in South Korea; in December 2009, with the aid of a friend, she escaped and successfully returned to Taiwan. In August 2010, Lin published a book detailing alleged mistreatment of aspiring stars in South Korea's entertainment industry, including pressure on singers of both genders to provide sexual services to prospective investors. In response to the controversy, her former management agency made a public announcement to the South Korean media that they had inserted a new clause into their contracts with their trainees making clarifications that they had the right to refuse unnecessary body contact. However, another trainee at the same institute, Cherry (), noted primarily for her G-cup breasts, refuted some of Lin's accusations in an appearance on talk show Gossip Queen (), claiming that Lin had not been forced into unwanted sexual contact but rather had actively sought a sexual relationship with her manager. In July 2010, Lin appeared nude in the Taiwan promotional materials for the Canadian film Splice. That same month, she also began guest appearances in the CTV television drama series Scent of Love (), giving the much younger Fok Siu-man () an on-screen kiss. In December 2010, she released a new photo collection book, \\"Angel's Stars\\" (). However, at the press conference announcing its release, she was careful to emphasise that the book contained no nudity.

Flex dancers, referred to as flexers, often perform shirtless and incorporate hat tricks in their performance for showmanship. Origins Before FlexN gained mainstream exposure, it started out at the home of a couple called Rocky and Sandra Cummings.. In 1992, the couple created a talent show and a local cable TV show in New York City, called 'Flex N Brooklyn'. The dance roots are traced back to reggae, dancehall, and \\"...a chopped-up instrumental called the 'Volume' riddim\\". The producers of the new genre refer to it as FDM, Flex Dance Music. Unlike other street dance styles originating in the United States, FlexN did not come from hip-hop dance, funk music, or hip-hop culture. It evolved from a Jamaican style of street dance called bruk-up. In a 2009 interview with WireTap magazine, dancer Stefan \\"Mr. Wiggles\\" Clemente described bruk-up as a \\"reggae style of animation.\\" Variations FlexN is represented by 8 movement styles, with flexers often mixing the styles. * Bone-breaking is characterized by rhythmic contortionist movement. * Bruk Up, ‚Äúbroken‚Äù in Jamaican Patois, is a style that resembles movement of broken limbs. * Connecting (K'nect'N), is often compared to tutting, but is of different origins than popping. * Get Lo integrates movements on the floor and the levels in between. * Grooving is the foundation of the flow of FlexN with roots in Jamaincan dancehall, characterized by rhythmic movements that can be subtle or aggressive. * Gliding is a style of illusion of air walking, sliding, and floating, using hand placements, body movement, and foot placement. * Hat Tricks is a style that utilizes the hat for illusions, concepts, and animations. * Pausing (Pauzn) is characterized by discrete movement similar to a movie watched frame by frame. Exposure FlexN has been performed on the third season of America's Best Dance Crew (ABDC), on the second season of The LXD, and at the Guggenheim Museum as part of the YouTube Play event. In 2011, the Huffington Post published a brief news article on flex dancers Bones the Machine and DJ Aaron. In 2013, NextLevelSquad performed FlexN at Breakin' Convention and Adedamola \\"Ringmaster Nugget\\" Orisagbemi performed FlexN at the Vail International Dance Festival. The 2013 independent film Flex Is Kings documents the lives of several flexers over a two-year period leading up to a dance competition called BattleFest.

Developed by 4J Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios a decade after the original's 2000 release, the remaster features several technical improvements, including higher resolution textures and models, a higher frame rate, and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live online service. It was released for the Xbox 360 video game console in March 2010, through the Xbox Live Arcade download service. The story of the game follows Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute organization, as she attempts to stop a conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne. Perfect Dark was developed over a course of nearly a year and its game engine was completely re-written from scratch to support several Xbox 360 features. Therefore, although the game plays exactly the same as the original, the code and renderer is different. The game received generally favorable reviews. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title was a solid revival of a classic. As of the end of 2011, the game had sold nearly 410,000 units. In 2015, the game was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One. Gameplay Perfect Dark is a remastered release of the 2000 first-person shooter video game of the same name, which was developed by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 as a spiritual successor to the 1997 hit GoldenEye 007. The game features a single- player mode consisting of 17 levels in which the player assumes the role of Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark as she attempts to stop a conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and a \\"Combat Simulator\\" where numerous players can compete against each other in traditional deathmatch settings. Combat Simulator matches can be highly customised and can include bots. A \\"Counter- Operative\\" mode, where one player controls the protagonist while the other controls enemies throughout a single-player level, attempting to stop the first player from completing objectives, is also included in the game. The remaster changes little from the core gameplay of the original game, but offers several enhancements in the multiplayer department. In the remaster, any of the multiplayer modes can be played in either splitscreen or through the Xbox Live online service. An online leaderboard system was also added, and players can earn achievements and in-game crowns by accomplishing certain tasks. Although Combat Simulator matches are still capped at 12 entities, the remaster can comprise eight players online simultaneously, an improvement to the original's cap of four players and eight bots. Players may also play against more than eight bots as long as there are enough slots available in a match. For example, a single player can play against 11 bots; such a feature was not possible in the original game. All the multiplayer content in the remaster is unlocked from the beginning, and weapons from GoldenEye 007, which were originally only available in the single-player mode, are now available in the multiplayer. The remaster also includes two new control set-ups, entitled \\"Spartan\\" and \\"Duty Calls\\", which are based on the Halo and Call of Duty first-person shooter franchises, respectively. Development Perfect Dark was developed by 4J Studios, the same studio that previously developed the Xbox Live Arcade versions of Rare's platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo- Tooie. According to Microsoft Game Studios creative director Ken Lobb, the development team \\"took the original code, ported it to the Xbox 360 and included deep [Xbox Live] integration.\\" The game was developed over a course of approximately 11 months after the creation of a working prototype. As the Xbox Live functionality had to be written from scratch, the developers opted to completely rewrite the game engine rather than do a port through emulation. As a result, although the game plays exactly the same, the code and renderer is different. The game runs at 1080p and 60 frames per second. While the original level geometry was kept, the levels received new textures, characters and weapons were recreated, and skyboxes were rebuilt. Lobb explained that \\"things are large and blocky because that's what [Perfect Dark] looks like\\", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, he was worried about them looking awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, \\"it's one of the areas that I give a lot of credit to the developer on. It just looks right. They were smart about the way they up-resed the models so they still feel like they're kind of retro, but they're clean.\\" Although music and sound effects were kept from the original recording sessions, original master recordings have been used to update the soundtrack at a higher quality; the original recording size was 16 MB, while in the remaster it is over 250 MB. Developers retained the free aim mode because they wanted to be faithful to the original game. According to Rare's Producer Nick Ferguson, \\"We didn't change the fundamental behavior of the aiming system simply because that is not how Perfect Dark was played\\". He also observed that the idea of updating the controls was actually seen as a flaw in Perfect Dark Zero, which tried to \\"combine the original Perfect Dark system with aspects of Halo\\". The original diagonal running, which allows players to move faster than by running forwards or sideways alone, did not work the first time they implemented the analog stick, so it was manually rewritten because it was considered essential for speedruns. Marketing and release Perfect Dark was first teased to consumers in April 2009 via a screenshot of a Rare employee's Xbox 360 dashboard which showed an icon for the game. It was confirmed to be in development on June 2, 2009 via Xbox Live Director of Programming Larry Hryb's Twitter account. The game was released on March 17, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Xbox Live Block Party promotion. As a cross- promotion with Crackdown 2, players with a Crackdown 2 saved game on their Xbox 360 hard drive can unlock that game's protagonist, known as Agent 4, as a playable skin in the game's multiplayer mode. A title update was released in April 2010 which addressed bugs, added two control schemes, and expanded playlists. Perfect Dark was downloaded over 150,000 times during its first week of release and grossed approximately $1.61 million at the end of the month. The game has sold more than 285,000 units as of August 2010 and nearly 325,000 units at the end of 2010. As of year-end 2011, sales had increased to nearly 410,000 units. In 2015, Perfect Dark was included in the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One. In 2019, the game was enhanced to run at native 4K resolution on Xbox One. Reception Perfect Dark received generally favorable reviews from critics. Writing for 1UP.com, Scott Sharkey highlighted the technical improvements, stating that the remaster is \\"a great way to re- enjoy a game you already love\\". Daemon Hatfield of IGN noted the game's outdated dialogue, voice acting, and mission objectives, but nevertheless remarked that the game \\"wasn't brought back for the uninitiated -- this is for the fans, and they will be very, very happy.\\" He also praised the game's multiplayer mode over Xbox Live and highlighted the selection of weapons, the satisfying gunplay, and leaderboards, noting that they allow players to compare their performance with their friends. Despite the praise, some reviewers criticized the game for its confusing level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is \\"not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly for the hell of it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps that you can get a little dizzy.\\" GameSpots Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was \\"oddly paced\\", and that \\"locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate.\\" Nevertheless, he admitted that \\"it's a lot of fun to replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives.\\" He also remarked that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag, but praised the amount of content and features. The game's original Counter-Operative mode was very well received, with Eurogamer remarking that it \\"still feels ahead of its time even now.\\" Dan Ryckert of Game Informer stated similar pros, saying that \\"it's even better this time around thanks to the framerate improvement.\\" Although the game's controls have been upgraded to support two analog sticks, Steven Hopper of GameZone noted that the game still \\"feels a little different from what modern day shooter fans are used to\\", while Eurogamer remarked that the aim assist can be unnecessarily generous on easy difficulties. At the end of March 2010, IGN named Perfect Dark Xbox Live Arcade Game of the Month.

The so-called arbitrary MDMT must be lower than or equal to the CET (which is an environmental or \\"process\\" property, see below) and must be higher than or equal to the (MDMT)M (which is a material property). Critical exposure temperature (CET) is the lowest anticipated temperature to which the vessel will be subjected, taking into consideration lowest operating temperature, operational upsets, autorefrigeration, atmospheric temperature, and any other sources of cooling. In some cases it may be the lowest temperature at which significant stresses will occur and not the lowest possible temperature. (MDMT)M is the lowest temperature permitted according to the metallurgy of the vessel fabrication materials and the thickness of the vessel component, that is, according to the low temperature embrittlement range and the charpy impact test requirements per temperature and thickness, for each one of the vessel's components.

It evolved from the British Guy Fawkes Night, which commemorates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Pope Night was most popular in the seaport towns of New England, especially in Boston, where it was an occasion for drinking, rioting, and anti-elite protest by the working class. Gang violence became part of the tradition in the 1740s, with residents of different Boston neighborhoods battling for the honor of burning the pope's effigy. By the mid-1760s these riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards the American Revolution (1765-1783), the class rivalries of Pope Night gave way to anti-British sentiment. Under the leadership of Pope Night organizer Ebenezer Mackintosh, Boston's North and South End gangs united in protest against the Stamp Act of 1765. Local authorities made several attempts to crack down on the festivities. In 1775, to avoid offending Canadian allies, George Washington issued an order forbidding any troops under his command from participating. The last known Pope Night celebration in Boston took place in 1776, though the tradition continued in other towns well into the 19th century.  History  The earliest known celebration of Pope Night took place on November 5, 1623, in Plymouth, Massachusetts. A group of sailors built a bonfire, which raged out of control and destroyed several nearby homes. By the late 17th century, annual festivities on November 5 were a New England tradition. Major celebrations were held in Boston, Marblehead, Newburyport, Salem, and Portsmouth. In 1702, locals in Marblehead held a bull-baiting and distributed the meat to the poor. = Mid-18th century = Over the years the celebration became more elaborate. By the 1720s, simple bonfires had been replaced with parades in which effigies of the Pope and the Devil were carried through the streets on a platform before being burned. The celebrants came from what were called the \\"lower orders\\" of society: sailors, laborers, apprentices, lesser artisans, servants, and African-American slaves. Active participants were all males; there is no record of any females taking part except as spectators. Pope Night was celebrated the most consistently and boisterously in Boston, due in part to the large number of sailors there. In the 18th century, sailors occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder; many were criminals, deserted soldiers, and runaway slaves. As a major seaport, Boston had a large contingent of maritime workers for whom a night of drinking, fighting, and insulting the elites had great appeal. Pope Night gave the common people a chance to express their dissatisfaction with the status quo on the pretext of condemning popery. The boisterous and often violent festivities were permitted only because the anti-papal theme made them acceptable to the ruling class. At least two fatal accidents occurred on Pope Night, possibly due to heavy drinking. In 1735, four apprentices drowned while canoeing home from Boston Neck after the bonfire. In 1764, a carriage bearing an effigy of the pope ran over a boy's head, killing him instantly. = Riot acts = Boston's elites were appalled by the increasingly rowdy festivities. One resident, complaining to a local newspaper in 1745, referred to the revelers as \\"rude and intoxicated Rabble, the very Dregs of the People, black and white\\", and urged the authorities to crack down. In 1748, the Justices of the Peace announced that \\"whereas sundry persons have heretofore gone about the streets ... armed wh. clubs & demanding money of ye inhabitants and breaking ye windows of ye who refuse it\\", they planned to send out constables to keep the peace. Similar notices were published over the next four years, to no avail. In 1753 the Great and General Court passed an act forbidding \\"all riotous, tumultuous and disorderly Assemblies\\" from \\"carrying pageants and other shews through the streets and lanes of the town of Boston and other towns of this province, abusing and insulting the inhabitants\\". The court passed similar acts in 1756, 1758, 1763, and 1769, but the locals were determined to have their fun. The 1769 Riot Act imposed penalties for shaking down wealthy residents: Authorities apparently could not rely on the militia to keep order on Pope Night. A possible explanation is that the militiamen themselves were among the revelers. Local militiamen participated in the market riot of 1737 and the Knowles Riot of 1747, and instigated the Montgomery Guards Riot of 1837. Following an accident on Pope Night in 1764 in which a boy was killed, the \\"Sheriff, Justices, and Officers of the Militia\\" were ordered to destroy the North and South End popes, but were unable to control the crowd, which numbered in the thousands. No mention is made of the militia's rank and file. = Decline = The passing of the Stamp Act in March 1765 caused a good deal of unrest in the American colonies. The Sons of Liberty were a leading group of American dissidents at this time. The Loyal Nine, a group of nine area businessmen, led the Sons of Liberty and were a link between the common people and wealthier classes. That summer the Loyal Nine arranged the unification of the North and South End mobs. On Pope Night 1765, townspeople held a \\"Union Feast\\", with a single procession led jointly by the South End mob leader, Ebenezer Mackintosh, and the North End leader, Samuel Swift. The two mobs stopped battling each other, and Mackintosh became the leader of the united group. John Hancock and other patriot merchants provided them with food, drink, and supplies. In author Alfred Young's view, Pope Night provided the \\"scaffolding, symbolism, and leadership\\" for resistance to the Stamp Act in 1764‚Äì65. The passage in 1774 of the Quebec Act, which guaranteed French Canadians free practice of Catholicism in the Province of Quebec, provoked complaints from some Americans that the British were introducing \\"Popish principles and French law\\". Such fears were bolstered by opposition from the Church in Europe to American independence, threatening a revival of Pope Night. Commenting in 1775, George Washington was less than impressed by the thought of any such resurrections, forbidding any under his command from participating: Generally, following Washington's complaint, American colonists stopped observing Pope Night, although according to the Bostonian Society some citizens of Boston celebrated it on one final occasion, in 1776. Sherwood Collins argues that the tradition ended in Boston at this time not only because of Washington's order, but because most of the celebrants were likely patriots who did not stay in Boston while it was held by the British; and, moreover, because it celebrated the failure of a plot against the British king and Parliament, who were now the enemy. The tradition continued in Salem as late as 1817, and was still observed in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1892. In the 1880s bonfires were still being lit in some New England coastal towns, although no longer to commemorate the failure of the Gunpowder Plot. In the area around New York, stacks of barrels were burnt on election day eve, which after 1845 was a Tuesday early in November.  Festivities  At the height of its popularity, Pope Night in Boston was a three-part ritual consisting of a procession in which effigies of the Pope and other figures were paraded through the streets; a battle between the processions from the North and South Ends; and the burning of the effigies by the victors. Locals would spend weeks preparing their effigies for the celebration. The processions were organized by elected officers who, unlike traditional political leaders, came from the lower classes. One such leader was Ebenezer Mackintosh of the South End, a shoemaker who was also the town's official sealer of leather. = Procession = The procession was led by young boys who carried small effigies of the pope. According to a 1768 broadsheet sold by the \\"Printers Boys in Boston\\": > The little Popes, they go out First, ::With little teney Boys: In Frolicks > they are full of Gale ::And laughing make a Noise. The boys carved the heads of their \\"popes\\" from potatoes, and mounted the effigies on shingles or boards, some small enough for a single boy to carry in his hands, others requiring two or three boys to carry through the streets. During the day they went door to door with their popes, demanding tributes from the neighbors in a tradition very similar to trick-or-treating. Next came the large effigies, which were mounted on wheeled platforms, like parade floats. The publisher Isaiah Thomas, who took part in the Pope Night celebrations as a child in the 1750s and 60s, described the floats in his memoir: The effigies' heads could also be raised, appearing to peek into second-story windows of nearby houses. The crowd shouted insults at the figures as they passed: The floats were typically about ten to twelve feet long, although there are accounts of much larger ones. One float in Newburyport was forty feet long, and so heavy it had to be drawn by several horses; it carried additional effigies of monks and friars as well as several dancers and fiddlers. In Boston, the floats were pulled through the narrow, winding streets by men and boys. During the 1760s, when Ebenezer Mackintosh was in charge of the South End procession, he would march ahead of the float, dressed in a blue and gold uniform with a lace hat, carrying a speaking trumpet. Besides being festive, the gaudy uniform was intended as a mockery of Boston's elites. The \\"pope\\" was dressed in ornate, antiquated garb, and had an exaggerated Roman nose. Behind him, the Devil was coated with tar and feathers, and stood holding a key in one hand and a pitchfork in the other. After 1701, the display also included an effigy of the exiled Catholic prince James Francis Edward Stuart, nicknamed the \\"Old Pretender\\", sometimes on a gibbet. Boys dressed up as devils and danced around the figures. The display reflected the prevailing belief among New England Protestants that Catholics were in league with the devil. The effigy pope's aristocratic appearance was also symbolic. Dressed in \\"gorgeous attire\\" with a large white wig and an enormous gold lace hat, the pope became a symbol of wealth as well as popery. During the procession, masked and costumed revelers would stop at the homes of wealthy residents and threaten to break their windows unless they contributed funds for the festivities. Sometimes they broke the windows just for fun, even after the owner had made a generous donation. In Boston there were usually two processions, one from the North End and the other from the South End. According to John Rowe (the Boston merchant for whom Rowes Wharf is named), there were three processions in 1766. Historian Francis Cogliano calls it a \\"wonderful irony\\" that the anti-papal processions in the colonies were so similar to the Carnival celebrations in Catholic Europe. Both celebrations gave the lower classes a chance to act out in a disorderly and aggressive fashion, intimidating the elites. Historian Jack Tager likens the street pageantry to European mummery or charivari. = Battle between the North and South Ends = By the mid-18th century, violence had become an established part of the Pope Night tradition in Boston. When the North and South End processions met, they fought a street battle with each group trying to capture the other's pope. The fighters attacked each other with clubs and brickbats, often resulting in serious injuries and even death. The publisher Isaiah Thomas recalled in his memoir that \\"altho' persons were seldom killed, yet broken heads were not infrequent\\". As a boy, Thomas himself was nearly killed one Pope Night when he was hit in the head with a brickbat. Another resident complained to the Boston Evening Post in 1745: In 1752, a sailor named John Crabb was clubbed to death on Pope Night by Thomas Chubb also a sailor, and a slave named Abraham. Chubb was branded on the hand and sentenced to a year in prison for his part in the killing; it is not known what happened to Abraham. = Bonfire = The location of the bonfire varied from year to year. If the North End won the battle, the effigies were burned in a bonfire on Copp's Hill; if the South End won, the effigies were burned on Boston Common. In addition to the Devil, the Pope, the Pretender, and Guy Fawkes, effigies of prominent contemporary figures were often burned on Pope Night. The actress Nancy Dawson was sometimes included as an effigy, other times as a man in costume. Others burnt in effigy included Admiral John Byng, John Mein (a Tory printer, hated by the patriots), Governor Thomas Hutchinson, various customs officials, two Prime Ministers of Great Britain (the Earl of Bute and Lord North), and the American traitor General Benedict Arnold. Revelers threw the bodies of the effigies into the fire, saving the heads for reuse the following year.

History The lands of Hoddom or Hoddam belonged to the Herries family, allies of the Bruce family who were Lords of Annandale from 1124. It passed to the Carruthers family, and then to the Maxwells. At the core of the castle is an L-plan tower house, built in the 16th century. It was probably built for Sir John Maxwell, who acquired Hoddom in the mid 16th-century when he married the heiress Agnes, Lady Herries. In the aftermath of the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, the Regent Moray besieged Hoddom, which capitulated after ten hours, on 21 June 1568.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 444. It was briefly the base of the Warden of the Scottish West March, but was recaptured in 1569 by supporters of Queen Mary. The following year it was attacked by the English under Lord Scrope, who blew up the tower. This tower was repaired and expanded in the 17th century to form a courtyard castle. It was acquired by Sir Richard Murray from the 6th Lord Herries, and then became the property of the Earl of Southesk in 1653. In 1690 it passed to the Sharpe family. In around 1826, General Matthew Sharpe of Hoddom commissioned William Burn to design modern extensions to the south and west of the castle. Hoddom was purchased in 1877 by the Brook family of Meltham, Huddersfield, who later bought nearby Kinmount House. Further extensions were built in a neo-Jacobean style to the north and west, some at least to designs by architects Wardrop and Anderson. The house was requisitioned by the military during the Second World War, and was not reoccupied afterwards. In the 1970s William Burn's extensions were largely demolished. The castle now stands in the grounds of a caravan park, and the remaining 19th-century additions are used as offices. The tower house is derelict, and has been included on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland. It is also included on Historic Scotland's Castle Conservation Register, which aims to identify buildings which could be successfully restored. In March 2009 planning permission was granted for a redevelopment of the castle, together with the building of a hotel, chalets and a golf course. Repentance Tower The Repentance Tower is a very rare example of a mid-16th century watch tower standing on nearby Trailtrow Hill. Built in 1565 by John Maxwell the tower takes its name from an inscription 'Repentance' carved on the stonework above the entrance door. It became a dovecote having fallen out of use with the union of the crowns under James VI of Scotland, James I of England.

The island is part of the Mentawai islands off the west coast of Sumatra. The structures are influenced by the Acehnese style, they are built on a much larger scale. They were formerly used as uma longhouses by the Sakuddei tribe before they were forced to abandon their traditional way of life through government intervention in the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, some attempts have been made to re-establish them in their former areas of settlement. Uma longhouses are rectangular with a verandah at each end. They can be 300 m2 in area. Built on piles, they traditional have no windows. The insides are separated into different dwelling spaces by partition which usually have inter-connecting doors. Villages are built alongside river banks and are made up of one or more communal Uma longhouses and single-storey family houses known as lalep. Villages housed up to 300 people and the larger villages were divided into sections along patrilineal clans of families with their own uma. Rusuk were dwellings for widows and bachelors which are similar to the family longhouse but without an altar. The uma is the centre of social, religious, and political life and it is here where every village member of egalitarian Mentawai society is able to contribute meetings about matters affecting the community. Like many Indonesians, Mentawaians believe in a separable soul that leaves the body upon death becoming a ghost. To protect themselves from these spirits, fetish sticks are placed by the entrances of the log wall that surrounds and fortifies the village and forms a stockade for cattle.

About 200 men served. They were selected and paid a fixed salary by the colonial government, and given the long delays in communication, they played a major role in negotiating with royal officials, and explaining colonial needs and resources. Their main business was with the Board of Trade, where the agent dealt with land problems, border disputes, military affairs, and Indian affairs. They provided the British officials with the documents and news, secured acceptance of controversial colonial legislation, and tried to head off policies objectionable to the colonies. They handled the appeal cases, which usually went to the Privy Council. Before 1700 a colony would send occasional special agents on a temporary basis. Thus Rhode Island sent John Clarke in 1660 to secure a Royal charter; it took two years, and then he returned. Permanent agents became the practice after 1700; most were Americans but some were British. Many of the agents worked together 1730-1733 to oppose a bill establishing a monopoly in West Indian rum, sugar and molasses. The most famous agent was Benjamin Franklin, who was employed for 15 years by Pennsylvania, and also by Georgia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Others include Richard Jackson, a prominent London lawyer who represented Connecticut, and Charles Pinckney who represented South Carolina. In 1768, the colony of Georgia hired Franklin, who was already Pennsylvania's colonial agent. Franklin favored Georgia's lower house, to the annoyance of the upper house and royal governor. He cut back his work for Georgia after 1771, because the colony was delinquent in paying his fees. David T. Morgan, \\"A New Look at Benjamin Franklin as Georgia's Colonial Agent,\\" Georgia Historical Quarterly, Summer 1984, Vol. 68 Issue 2, pp 221-232 William Samuel Johnson, a Connecticut lawyer, was known in the 1760s as an colonial rights. As the colonial agent for Connecticut he sharply criticized British policy toward the colonies. His experience in London in 1767 convinced him that Britain's policy was shaped more by ignorance of American conditions and not through the sinister designs of a wicked government, He felt that the American Revolution was not necessary and that independence would be bad for everyone concerned.Elizabeth P.

In 2010 he was sentenced to 2¬Ω years imprisonment for 'disturbing social order'. Zhao was born circa 1972. He used to work for the Food Quality and Safety Authority of China. His son, Pengrui, was born in late 2005 and became ill as a result of drinking tainted milk. The couple also have a daughter, Sian, born in 2008/2009.  Activism and website  Zhao became a leader in the movement of parents to get restitution and treatment for their children. He called for a national memorial day for the victims. He held a memorial ceremony in his home for parents of harmed children. He started the \\"Home for Kidney Stone Babies\\" (ÁªìÁü≥ÂÆùÂÆù‰πãÂÆ∂, jieshibaobao.com) website from his apartment in Daxing, near Beijing. The website was blocked in China. The site was also shut down by the government so he moved hosting to Japan. Parents of children harmed by melamine-tainted milk went to the website and could exchange information about how to sue. Zhao also pushed for increased research into the number of kidney stone babies. The site published a leaked document from the Henan Department of Health, which had allegedly ordered workers to underreport kidney stone cases. The website also posted claims that autopsies of children were being denied. In 2009, Zhao posted a petition arguing against accepting the government's compensation plan as inadequate (especially considering the long-term unknowns), and not created in consultation with parents. The petition was signed by several hundred parents. The police and/or public security bureau harassed him, his wife, his mother, his siblings, and volunteer students. The government also broke up meetings and a press conference.  Arrest, trial, imprisonment  Zhao was taken by police in mid- November 2009. Arrest papers were given to his wife Li Xuemei on 21 December 2009, on charges, she said, of \\"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\\". His case was handed to prosecutors in early 2010. He was tried at Daxing district court in Beijing where he was legally represented by Li Fangping and Peng Jian. A lawyer's blog claimed the police wrote the following: > From September 2008 to September 2009, Zhao Lianhai used 'protecting rights' > as well as the Sanlu milk powder issue as an excuse to hype and agitate > people who did not know the truth to disturb social order ... by shouting > slogans and gathering illegally. He was sentenced on 10 November 2010 to 2¬Ω years prison. The main charge was inciting social disorder. Three incidents were used against Zhao at his trial: * Organizing a gathering of 12 parents * Holding a sign in front of a factory and court * Giving media interviews in a public place Amnesty International condemned the sentence and he began a hunger strike in protest. Li Xuemei, his wife, indicated there would be an appeal. Leung Man-tao, a Hong Kong based writer, wrote an op-ed in Southern Weekend in Guangzhou, defending Zhao. He was named as a political prisoner by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China,Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Political Prisoner Databas: Zhao Lianhai . and as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.Chinese Prisoner of Conscience Released from Prison, Amnesty International, 13 January 2011. Zhao was subsequently released on medical parole, which normally allows freedom of movement, subject to regular reports to the local police. But Zhao has largely been restricted to his Daxing home and official harassment has continued, such as when he tried to take his children for a day out on 31 May 2011, and the family were surrounded by police and public security officials and held in a nearby restaurant in what onlookers thought was a hostage situation.  Censorship  Reports and discussions on Chinese websites are restricted. On 30 March 2010, Hong Kong singer Gigi Leung posted about the unjustly jailed Zhao Lianhai on Sina Weibo. After receiving a message from website's administrator, Gigi Leung then deleted the relevant blog, resulted in hundreds of supportive messages from her fans.

His paternal grandfather was Edward Hales, third son of John Hales (1469/70 ‚Äì c. 1540), Baron of the Exchequer, and younger brother of Sir James Hales (c. 1500‚Äì1554), Justice of the Common Pleas, whose suicide, the subject of a lawsuit in Hales v.

In April 1640 he was re-elected MP for Queenborough for the Short Parliament. He was elected again in November 1640 for the Long Parliament, and held the seat until 1648 when he was excluded under Pride's Purge. Hales died in 1654 at the age of 78. Marriages and issue Hales married firstly Deborah Harlakenden, daughter of Martin Harlakenden of Woodchurch, Kent, and through her acquired the Woodchurch estates. He married secondly Martha Cromer, daughter of Sir Matthew Carew, and widow of Sir James Cromer of Tunstall, Kent, and through her acquired the Tunstall estates. She also inherited the manor of 'Herst Hall' in Murston. His children by his first wife included a son, Sir John Hales, who pre-deceased him. He was then succeeded by his grandson Sir Edward Hales, 2nd Baronet. The latter was a Royalist and supporter of King Charles I, who attempted to raise an army for the King in Kent and was involved in an attempt to free the King when he was imprisoned at Carisbrooke Castle.

Advocacy =Views on the treatment of Julian Assange= Melzer visited Julian Assange in prison on 9 May 2019, accompanied by two medical experts specialised in examining potential victims of torture and other ill-treatment, to assess his situation. On 31 May he described the treatment Assange had received from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, and Ecuador as psychological torture and the US indictments as the \\"criminalisation of investigative journalism\\". In a November 2019 statement Melzer criticised the UK government for placing Assange's life at risk by ignoring previous warnings about the state of his health. He said Assange \\"continues to be detained under oppressive conditions of isolation and surveillance, not justified by his detention status\\". He also said that Assange's access to legal counsel and documents were being severely obstructed, preventing him from preparing a defence against \\"the world's most powerful government\\". Melzer asked the UK government to stop Assange's extradition to the US, release him and allow him to \\"recover his health and rebuild his personal and professional life\\". The Swedish prosecutor announced that the investigation had been dropped as of 19 November 2019.http://www.thelocal.se/20191119/swedish-prosecutor-holds-press- conference-in-julian-assange-case The same month Melzer also strongly criticised Assange's treatment in all the legal proceedings in the U.K., U.S., Ecuador, and Sweden, stating that there was \\"no due process proceeding whatsoever\\" and \\"severe violations of due process consistently\\". In a January 2020 interview Melzer said he had never seen a comparable case where a person was subjected to nine years of a preliminary investigation for rape without charges being filed. He said Assange's lawyers made over 30 offers to arrange for Assange to visit Sweden in exchange for a guarantee that he would not be extradited to the U.S and described such diplomatic assurances as routine international practice. Melzer criticised the Swedish prosecutors for, among other things, supposedly changing one of the women's statements without her involvement in order to make it sound like a possible rape. Melzer said that the Swedish rape investigation was an abuse of process aimed at pushing Assange into a corner from which he was unable to defend himself. One of the women interviewed by Melzer later sharply criticized him and demanded his resignation. She said that by defining how a \\"proper rape-victim\\" would have to act, Melzer was engaging in victim blaming and that his report was partially \\"untrue and defamatory\\".https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/julian-assange-opfer-von- wikileaks-gruender-kritisiert-uno-folterexperten-nils- melzer-a-5d1882b7-945f-42fd-a7a0-ec3012dd886b Honours and awards *Melzer's legal study called Targeted Killing in International Law was a joint-winner of the 2009 Paul Guggenheim Prize in International Law, awarded by the Geneva Graduate Institute.

BMS controls technical security features like CCTV, all electronic equipments, access control system, lift system, water and electronics management systems. The BMS system enables micro-check on all aspects of the building to ensure a secure environment to work. Green architecture Marathon Futurex is expected to get a gold rating from the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) for its eco friendly design concept and construction methodology. A solar envelope Design study identified changing thermal patterns throughout the year based on which the cooling of the building has been designed. The building fa√ßade is made of double-glazed, Low-e glass that lets in the light but cuts out the heat. During the construction phase materials like fly ash, micro silicon, low volatile organic compound paints, adhesives and other recycled resources have been used to ensure minimal environment damage.

History Leeuwin Estate was established in 1973 by Denis and Tricia Horgan. The land was previously used as a cattle station and after having been purchased as part of a deal to buy a plumbing business by Denis Horgan in 1969, the land was converted to vineyards based on the advice of the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. Robert Mondavi provided significant advice during the planning and setup stages of the estate after contacting the Horgans in 1972 to promote the potential that Margaret River had as a wine region and to look for investment opportunities. Initial plantings consisted of Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Pinot noir. Bob Cartwright was appointed as head winemaker in 1978. In the same year that Cartwright was appointed, the first vintage of wines were made. The vines had reached maturity and could provide enough grapes for commercial production and bottling levels. Cartwright held the position of head winemaker for 28 consecutive vintages until retiring in September 2005. The current senior winemaker is Tim Lovett. The winery is still owned by Denis and Tricia Horgan, with their son Justin and daughter Simone working as the company Joint Chief Executive Officers. Denis Horgan was awarded a Centenary Medal and both he and Tricia Horgan were inducted as Members of the Order of Australia in 2001 for services to tourism in Western Australia. Wines Leeuwin Estate produces around 60,000 cases of wine each vintage and owns 121 acres of vineyards. The most well known wine produced by Leeuwin Estate is the \\"Art Series Chardonnay\\". It has been described by wine critic James Halliday as \\"Australia's finest example\\" of Chardonnay and the Langton's Classification of Australian Wine places it at the highest level of \\"Exceptional\\". The first vintage of the Art Series Chardonnay was from 1980, with the first vintage of the wine receiving a recommendation as the best Chardonnay in the world by Decanter in 1982, bringing Leeuwin Estate to the attention of the wine world. A large proportion of the grapes used in this wine are from the \\"Block 20\\" vineyard, which was noted as one of the \\"Top 25 Australian Vineyards\\" by Australian Sommelier Magazine. As well as the Chardonnay, Leewin Estate produces four other flagship \\"Art Series\\" wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc. Each of the five \\"Art Series\\" wines in each vintage has a new painting printed on the label from an Australian artist. The \\"Art Series Cabernet Sauvignon\\" is listed at the \\"Distinguished\\" level of the Langton's Classification, being described by Langton's as representative of the \\"quintessential southern Margaret River style\\" and by Robert Parker as \\"one of Australia‚Äôs great Bordeaux-styled Cabernets\\". A number of lower priced wines are released under the \\"Prelude\\" and \\"Siblings\\" labels. Since 2002, Leeuwin Estate has bottled all their wines under screw cap. Restaurant The restaurant at Leeuwin Estate won the award for the Regional Restaurant of the Year in The West Australian Good Food Guide 2012. It was ranked as a two star restaurant in the 2013 edition of the same guide, and a Top 10 West Australian restaurant in 2017. Leeuwin Estate Concert Series Leeuwin Estate hosts an annual series of concerts featuring major Australian and international performers. The first concert was a performance from the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1985.

Despite the fact that his real name long remained unknown, Scribe D has been described as \\"so well known to students of late Middle English manuscripts that he hardly needs any introduction\\".Thaisen, J. \\"The Trinity Gower D Scribe's Two Canterbury Tales Manuscripts Revisited\\", in Mooney & Connolly, Design and distribution of late medieval manuscripts in England, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2008, p.41 Identification and conjectured biography \\"Anglicana formata at its best\\": the hand of Scribe D, from BL.

I. and Parkes, M. B. \\"The Production of Copies of the Canterbury Tales and Confessio Amantis in the Early Fifteenth Century\\" in Parkes and Watson (eds), Medieval Scribes, Manuscripts and Libraries, London, 1978, pp.163‚Äì210 The hand has been characterised as \\"Anglicana formata at its best\\"; restrained, traditional and rather austere, with a slight influence of secretary hand.Parkes, M. B. Their hands before our eyes: a closer look at scribes, Ashgate Publishing, 2008, p.111 The manuscripts in which this hand appears show that Scribe D was active between the 1390s and 1420s.Thaisen, p.42 The spellings used by Scribe D have suggested to some critics that his original dialect was that of the south-west Midlands of England, particularly north Worcestershire;Thaisen, p.42 Kerby- Fulton has suggested that Scribe D can be regarded as one of a class of \\"'reasonably educated men' who came up from the provinces seeking their fortunes, Dick Whittington style\\".Kerby-Fulton, K. Written work: Langland, Labor, and Authorship, Publisher University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997, p.118 More recent scholarship has proposed he was in fact a Londoner influenced by his extensive work with manuscripts from the south-west Midlands, such as those of Langland.Horobin, Simon, and Daniel W. Mosser. \\"Scribe D‚Äôs SW Midlands Roots: A Reconsideration\\". Neuphilologische Mitteilungen 106 (2005): 289‚Äì305. His particular specialisation in the works of John Gower seems to have resulted in him picking up several unusual word forms used by Gower, who had a London (\\"East Midlands\\") dialect with idiosyncratic Suffolk and Kent influences, and subsequently using them when copying the works of Geoffrey Chaucer.Transcript of discussion on \\"Manuscript Studies and Literary Geography\\", in Laing & Nicholson (eds) Speaking in our tongues: proceedings of a colloquium on medieval dialectology, Boydell & Brewer, 1994, p.113 One of Scribe D's earliest identified works, based on the style of the illumination used in the manuscript, is the important \\"C text\\" of William Langland's Piers Plowman, contained in University of London MS. v.88. This contains scribal editing of \\"real skill\\" in addition to unique material written either by a \\"Langland enthusiast\\" or Langland himself.Benson, C. D. Public Piers Plowman: modern scholarship and late medieval English culture, Penn State, 2004, p.66 It may be significant that Scribe D's first surviving commission was for Piers Plowman, a work written in the same south-west Midland dialect that he could have spoken himself. Once established in London, Scribe D may have worked with other professional scribes. He is known to have worked on the same manuscript, the \\"Trinity Gower\\" manuscript, as the scribe of the Ellesmere and Hengwrt manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales and either both men or the bookseller they worked for seem to have had good links to the London literary world, being able to obtain high-quality draft copies of texts. Another of the scribes working on the Trinity Gower was Thomas Hoccleve, himself a poet and an admirer (and possibly friend) of Chaucer. Some scholars, such as Estelle Stubbs, have argued that Scribe D and his colleagues may, rather than trying to assemble the Cantebury Tales after Chaucer's death in 1400, have been steadily revising and recopying manuscripts in several stages with possible authorial supervision or input.Stubbs, E. \\"'Here's One I Prepared Earlier': The Work of Scribe D on Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 198\\", Review of English Studies (2007) 58 (234): 133‚Äì153 In recent years, Scribe D has been tentatively identified by Mooney and Stubbs as John Marchaunt, active as Town Clerk of London between 1380 and 1417;SCRIBE D=JOHN MARCHAUNT, A Digital Catalogue of the pre 1500 Manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales in 2018, however, Lawrence Warner argued that the Marchaunt identification had no evidentiary support: there are no substantial documents known to be in Marchaunt's hand with which to compare these records, which seem to have been identified as Scribe D's on the assumption that he was Marchaunt rather than the other way around. Mooney and Stubbs also cite the appearance of the name 'Jhon Marcant' in the margin of a Canterbury Tales manuscript by Scribe D as evidence that a later reader knew who the scribe was, but both this and a second marginal entry ('Jhon Marka') in the manuscript appear next to passages concerning jealousy and thus provide no evidence regarding the scribe's identity.Lawrence Warner, Chaucer's Scribes: London Textual Production, 1384‚Äì1432 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 97‚Äì103).

It is located near the town common, at 8 Newton Street, in an architecturally distinguished Colonial Revival building constructed in 1912 to a design by Worcester architect Lucius Briggs. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Architecture and history The Beaman Memorial Public Library stands on the northern end of the West Boylston village center, on a triangular parcel of land bounded on two sides by Newton and Central Streets. It is a two-story masonry building, built of brick with marble trim, a raised granite foundation, and a green slate hip roof. The main facade is symmetrical, with three bays. The outer bays have tripled windows set in segmented-arch openings with paneling below, flanking the entrance, which is set in a marble hooded surround. A marble stringcourse separates the first and second floors, and there is a modillioned wooden cornice at the roof line. To the rear of this original building stands a large addition, built in 1999. Although it is built using concrete blocks, they are stained to match the brick of the original building, and other exterior features were designed in sympathy to the original. The public library of West Boylston was established in 1874 by the bequest of David Lee Rice, and originally was housed in a room of the high school. It later expanded to other quarters, but the entire town center was forced to relocate in the early 20th century, when the Wachusett Reservoir was created. The present library building was built as part of a municipal construction program occasioned by that event, and was a gift to the town of George Calvin Rice. The building was designed by Worcester architect Lucius Briggs, and is the town's only institutional example of Colonial Revival architecture. It is also an important early collaboration between Briggs and the builder, E.F. Cross of Worcester, who went on to collaborate on a number of other significant projects. The library is named for Ezra Beaman, George Calvin Rice's grandfather.

Facial nerve paralysis is a relatively common condition with a yearly incidence of 0.25% leading to function loss of the mimic muscles. The facial nerve gives off several branches in the face. If one or more facial nerve branches are paralysed, the corresponding mimetic muscles lose their ability to contract. This may lead to several symptoms such as incomplete eye closure with or without exposure keratitis, oral incompetence, poor articulation, dental caries, drooling, and a low self-esteem. This is because the different branches innervate the frontalis muscle, orbicularis oculi and oris muscles, lip elevators and depressors, and the platysma. The elevators of the upper lip and corner of the mouth are innervated by the zygomatic and buccal branches. When these branches are paralysed, there is an inability to create a symmetric smile. Smile surgery is performed as a static or dynamic reconstruction. An example of static reconstruction is upper and lower lip shortening or thickening with commissure preservation. Dynamic smile reconstruction procedures restore the facial nerve activity. Historical background The first known surgical repair of an injured facial nerve was performed by Drobnick in 1879, who connected the proximal spinal accessory nerve (innervates trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles) to the paralysed facial nerve. More symmetrical features were the result. In 1971 a new technique for facial nerve reconstruction was introduced, as Scaramella and Smith reported on the technique of cross facial nerve grafting (CFNG) for reconstruction of a coordinated smile in unilateral facial paralysis cases. Harii et al. for the first time used a free muscle transfer in combination with a nerve transfer in 1976. Eight years later, Terzis introduced the \\"babysitter\\" procedure, which consists of a combination of CFNGs and a simultaneous partial hypoglossal to facial nerve transfer. In 1989, Zuker et al. suggested the use of the masseteric nerve as possible donor nerve for innervation of the transplanted muscle in patients with Moebius syndrome. Indications The main indications for dynamic smile reconstruction are unilateral or bilateral facial paralysis due to acquired and congenital causes. Trauma, Bell's palsy and tumour extirpation are examples of secondary or acquired facial paralysis. Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial paralysis is a condition which leads to facial paralysis, however, without a known cause. It has an acute onset and is mostly self-limiting. But if spontaneous recurrence of (near) normal function does not take place, surgical reanimation may be indicated. Some head and neck tumours invade or compress the facial nerve leading to facial paresis or paralysis. Examples of such tumours are facial neuromas, cholesteatomas, hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, parotid gland neoplasms or metastases. Sometimes, the facial nerve cannot be preserved during resection of these tumours. Congenital facial paralysis occurs usually unilaterally and may be complete or incomplete. The most common congenital cause is the Moebius syndrome. Moebius syndrome is a congenital neurological disorder with bilateral paralysis of both the facial and abducens nerves. Therefore, lateral eye movement and facial animation are absent. In Moebius-like syndrome, only one side of the face is affected, but with additional nerve palsies of the affected facial and abducens nerve. Surgical techniques 1\\\\. Algorithm for dynamic smile reconstruction in acquired facial paralysis 2\\\\. Algorithm for dynamic smile reconstruction in congenital facial paralysis Selection of the type of nerve transfer is based on the individualised needs and condition of the patient. Individual factors can be patient age, type of paralysis (partial or complete, uni- or bilateral), denervation time of the mimetic muscles, availability of nerve grafts and medical condition of the patient. If facial paralysis is caused by trauma or tumour surgery, direct reinnervation of the facial muscles (ideally within 72 hours after facial nerve damage) can be achieved by neurorrhaphy, with or without an interposition nerve graft. (Algorithm 1) Neurorrhaphy is a primary end-to-end reconnection of the facial nerve stumps. However, tension-free reconnection is needed, otherwise scar formation can occur and axons will regenerate outside the facial nerve. If a tension-free reconnection is not possible, interposition nerve grafts are an option. Mostly the great auricular nerve or sural nerve is used as a graft between the two facial nerve stumps. Cross facial nerve graftIn more long standing acquired facial paralysis either a CFNG procedure or \\"babysitter\\" procedure are the indicated techniques, with or without a free muscle transfer.(Algorithm 1) Secondary facial paralysis with a denervation time of less than 6 months can be treated with one or more cross facial nerve grafts (CFNGs). During a cross facial nerve graft procedure one or more branches of the non-paralysed facial nerve are divided and connected to one or more sural nerve grafts which are tunnelled to the affected side of the face. Whether these nerve grafts are immediately attached to the paralysed facial nerve branches or after 9 to 12 months depends on the chosen procedure. Babysitter procedureIf facial paralysis lasts between 6 months and 2 years, the \\"babysitter\\" procedure may be used.(Algorithm 1) During this operation both CFNGs and part of an undamaged donor nerve on the affected side are used. For example, the hypoglossal nerve or masseteric nerve on the affected side can be used as donor nerves. This donor nerve is then attached to the distal end of the paralysed facial nerve. A free muscle transplant is sometimes indicated after the \\"babysitter\\" procedure has been performed, depending on the continuity of the injured facial nerve. In other words, if there is contraction of the mimetic muscle during an electromyogram. After a denervation time of approximately more than 2 years, atrophy of the mimetic muscles is permanent. In these cases a free muscle transfer is always performed in combination with a CFNG. Motor donor nerveThe procedure of choice for congenital facial paralysis is either CFNG or motor donors, both with a free muscle transfer. (Algorithm 2) Incomplete bilateral Moebius syndrome has the same clinical features as the Moebius syndrome, however some motor function is still apparent on one side of the face. This incomplete syndrome is reanimated with the use of the CFNG and free muscle transfer. The cross facial nerve graft comes from the side with some motor function of the facial nerve. However it first has to be investigated if the motor function of the nerve is strong enough to be separated. A free muscle transfer is always used on the paralysed side, as the muscle is a congenital atrophic muscle. Complete bilateral Moebius syndrome is treated with motor donor nerves on both sides. Optional motor donor nerves are: the masseteric nerve, accessory nerve or hypoglossal nerve. In rare cases when these nerves are also affected, cervical nerve branches can be used. The use of a free muscle transfer is again indicated. The nerve that initially innervated the free muscle transfer is then connected to the provided branches of the motor donor nerve. In Moebius- like syndrome the CFNG is performed, as the facial nerve on the affected side does not have a strong enough motor function. A free muscle transfer is also used, due to the atrophic muscle. Surgical procedures Based on the preference of the surgeon, the gracilis muscle, latissimus dorsi muscle, or pectoralis minor muscle are used as free neurovascular grafts. The gracilis muscle is mostly used free neurovascular muscle, because it has a reliable anatomy and is relatively simple to harvest. In addition, it can be trimmed for the correct size and volume with preservation of superior contraction qualities compared to bipennate muscles, because the gracilis is a parallel- fibered or strap muscle. Another advantage is the possibility for simultaneous dissection by a second team while the first team is preparing the face for the free muscle transplant. Another option for a free muscle transfer is the latissimus dorsi muscle. A disadvantage is that it can only be harvested with the patient in lateral decubitus or prone position. Therefore, the patient has to be turned during the operation. Advantages of the latissimus dorsi muscle are its reliable anatomy and relatively simple dissection. Analogue to the gracilis muscle, this muscle can be trimmed to the correct size and volume. The latissimus dorsi muscle is also a parallel-fibered muscle. Its long neurovascular bundle makes a one-stage facial reanimation without a CFNG possible. By using the long thoracodorsal nerve of the latissimus dorsi muscle, direct coaptation to the facial nerve on the other side can be performed. The third option is the pectoralis minor muscle, which is mainly used in children. Advantages of this muscle are its relatively small size and flat and fan-like shape, obviating the need for trimming without bulkiness as a result. In addition, the pectoralis minor muscle has a muscle fibre orientation that is much alike with the facial muscles. However, as dissection of this muscle is rather difficult and the neurovascular anatomy is variable, nowadays surgeons tend to use it less frequently. Furthermore, the pectoralis minor muscle is not a parallel-fibered muscle, and it is oversized in adults. During a one-stage or two-stage CFNG procedure, one or more non-affected facial nerve branches are used for reinnervation of the paralysed side. In the one stage procedure a free muscle transplant with a latissimus dorsi graft or a nerve graft (using the sural nerve or saphenous nerve) can be used. The latissimus dorsi graft is used because of its long thoracodorsal nerve. Therefore, it can be coapted directly to the normal functioning facial nerve. The one stage CFNG, implies an end-to-side coaptation of the sural or saphenous nerve to the distal end of the affected facial nerve. In the two- stage procedure, an incision in front of the ear is made on the non-paralysed side. Upon electrical stimulation, the nerve which produces the best contraction of the zygomatic muscles (and so the appearance of a smile) is selected. This branch is then sectioned. The sural or saphenous nerve as cross facial nerve graft is coapted to this unaffected branch of the facial nerve and tunnelled across the face to the paralysed side through a subcutaneous tunnel. The end of the graft is positioned in front of the tragus (cartilage in front of the ear) on the paralysed side. Nine to twelve months is needed for axonal regeneration in the cross facial nerve graft, because the result of damaged nerve tissue is loss of structure and axonal function. Degeneration appears distally in the paralysed facial nerve but this takes time, this process is called Wallerian degeneration. During the second stage end-to-side or end-to-end nerve coaptation to the proximal end of the paralysed facial nerve is performed with a microscope. And a free muscle transplant is placed, if indicated. Likewise the \\"babysitter\\" procedure uses the CFNG, in combination with the masseteric or hypoglossal nerve. In the \\"babysitter\\" procedure, the hypoglossal nerve or masseteric nerve on the affected side is identified. This donor nerve is then attached to the distal end of the paralysed facial nerve. Techniques for donor nerve transfers are transposition of the entire donor nerve, partial transposition by splitting the donor nerve longitudinally or indirect hypoglossal- or masseteric-facial anatomosis using a 'jump' interposition graft. This usually is the great auricular nerve or sural nerve. These hypoglossal- or masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis using a 'jump' interposition graft can be used to directly reinnervate the paralysed facial muscles or as a \\"babysitter\\" procedure. The goal of the latter is only to achieve fast reinnervation of the mimetic muscle to prevent irreversible atrophy. Simultaneously one or more CFNGs are performed to eventually reinnervate the mimetic muscles, again as a one- or two-stage procedure, depending on the choice for the free muscle transfer graft. If a two-stage procedure is performed, the CFNGs are connected to the distal branches of the paralysed facial nerve during the second stage 9 to 12 months later. The donor nerve can be left intact. If a free muscle transfer is indicated, this is also performed in the second stage of the procedure to augment the partially reinnervated mimic muscles by the hypoglossal nerve. In case of longstanding facial paralysis with irreversible muscle atrophy and unavailability of a suitable donor facial nerve, a free muscle graft is indicated for smile restoration, which has to be reinnervated by another donor nerve (usually the masseteric nerve) in an end-to-end fashion. Through an incision in front of the ear, the cheek flap is elevated below the underlying layer of fat. Here the nerve stimulator can be used in identifying the donor motor nerve to the masseter muscle. Once the nerve is identified, it is dissected from its connections and traced into the muscle to free as much length as possible. Results All procedures in general show an improvement of symmetry of smile and patient satisfaction, although time of recovery differs between different approaches. Primary neurorrhaphy provides the best possible outcome, as the anatomy and function of the damaged facial nerve is restored. After primary neurorrhaphy of the facial nerve mean recovery time typically is 6 to 12 months. The contraction amplitude after using a CFNG is usually not very powerful, but it results in a relatively spontaneous smile because the contralateral healthy facial nucleus controls the movements. After a CFNG procedure the first signs of reinnervation usually occur between 4 and 12 months. The use of the masseteric nerve provides an amount of movement that is within the normal range, resulting in a more symmetrical but not completely emotional smile. Nerve transfers using the hypoglossal or masseteric nerves and the \\"babysitter\\" procedure result in first contractions of the mimic muscles after approximately 4 to 6 months. However, after the use of the hypoglossal nerve control of facial movements is hard to obtain by the patient and a spontaneous smile may not occur at all. True spontaneity of a smile will not occur at the same rate in all dynamic smile reconstructions. A spontaneous smile is smiling without consciously thinking about it. The primary neurorrhaphy and free muscle transfer are the only options to restore a true spontaneous smile. Although the masseteric nerve transfer provides a strong smile within the range of normal, it never becomes truly spontaneous and emotional. But with practice, the majority of patients can provide a spontaneous smile some of the time due to the plasticity of the cerebral cortex. Effective rehabilitation can also prevent biting whilst smiling, when using the masseteric nerve as nerve transfer. Complications There are several complications, however, most patients find them less invalidating than the inability to smile. General postoperative complications are infection of the muscle donor site, facial abscess, hypertrophic scars, hematoma, and swelling of the face or muscle donor site. In some cases of incomplete facial paralysis, the procedure had a decline in function as a result. However, this improved after only a few months. Almost all procedures show synkinesis, meaning involuntary movements appear during the voluntary movements. In primary neurorrhapy, with or without an interposition graft, perineural fibrosis is a common complication. With the use of the CFNG there is a risk of sensory deficits in the lower part of the leg, due to the sural or sapheneous nerve graft. A complication seen with the use of the masseteric nerve is the inability to chew without the appearance of a smile. The hypoglossal nerve as a donor nerve can induce tongue atrophy due to denervation.

He saw himself as a ‚Äúvice crusader‚Äù publishing fearless expos√©s about corruption and gangster rule in the city, while others derided him as a blackmailer who threatened to write defamatory articles about people if they didn‚Äôt pay him off. He was the third of three newspapermen murdered in Minneapolis between 1934 and 1945. No one was ever punished in Kasherman‚Äôs death, but the brazen killing came during the mayoral election season and helped elect Hubert Humphrey on a clean-up-the-city platform., Shiffer, James Eli, and Ewen Media. Rubbedout.net, a digital history project, 2010  Early life  Kasherman was born in Russia and immigrated to the United States when he was about 10 years old. He grew up in the heavily Jewish enclave of north Minneapolis and graduated from North High School. He wanted to be a lawyer and attended the Minnesota College of Law. But his legal career was derailed when he got caught up in a corruption investigation in City Hall. He was jailed for contempt of court when he refused to testify about a gangster‚Äôs payoff of the police chief. His reason: he was a ‚Äúnewspaperman.‚Äù From then on, he fancied himself a crusader against the gambling, prostitution and liquor racketeers and their police and political cronies. He ran a long-shot campaign for mayor in 1931,Minneapolis Star. May 12, 1931. but he devoted most of his efforts to the gritty, blog-like world of the scandal sheet and alternative press.  Tangles with authority  Kasherman worked for a time with Howard Guilford, the muckraking, often scurrilous and bigoted publisher of the Saturday Press and the Twin City Reporter. Like Guilford, Kasherman found himself on the receiving end of the city‚Äôs censorship efforts when authorities confiscated his newspaper twice in 1931. Kasherman was also hit over the head with an iron pipe. As if Kasherman needed more evidence of the dangers of practicing his kind of journalism, his old mentor, Guilford, was murdered in a drive-by shooting in 1934. The next year, another publisher who had written about ties between gangsters and government, Walter Liggett of the Midwest American, was slain in an alley in front of his family. In 1936, Kasherman was arrested in a sting operation in which a brothel operator accused him of shaking her down for $25 per month on threats he would write her up in his paper. The following year, Kasherman was sentenced to prison in a clear effort to silence him.Minneapolis Tribune. January 20, 1937. He served time in Stillwater until 1940.  His final years  Kasherman quickly resumed publishing the Public Press, and set his sights on Mayor Marvin L. Kline, a Republican, whom he accused of allowing gangsters to run rampant. The December 1944 issue of the ‚ÄúPublic Press‚Äù featured the headline ‚ÄúKline Administration Most Corrupt Regime in the History of the City.‚Äù A month later, on the night of Jan. 22, 1945, Kasherman was ambushed after eating dinner with a friend and shot dead on a sidewalk at 15th and Chicago avenues in Minneapolis. His death made the front pages of newspapers across the Twin Cities, but few in the city were surprised when the police investigation quickly petered out. Still, the killing was a timely boost to the would-be mayor Hubert Humphrey, who capitalized on Kasherman‚Äôs death with the help of campaign staffers with inside knowledge of the investigation and the ability to plant newspaper stories about it that damaged Kline. Humphrey was elected with an overwhelming margin and has been credited with reducing corruption and gangsterism in Minneapolis during his three years in office. Kasherman‚Äôs murder was never solved, but he perhaps received some posthumous vindication in Humphrey‚Äôs choice as police chief, Ed Ryan, a police officer who was a friend of Kasherman. Kasherman was buried next to his father in United Hebrew Brotherhood Cemetery, Richfield, Minnesota. The Minneapolis police still have an open homicide file for Arthur Kasherman that is available to the public in Room 31 in City Hall.

He composed it in 1729 for the funeral of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then. The music is lost, but the libretto survives. As Bach is known to have used musical material which also appeared in two surviving works, one being the St Matthew Passion, it has been possible to make reconstructions. The cantata is in 24 movements (choruses, arias and recitatives) divided into four parts. The first deals with the principality in mourning, the second the prince's departing and the salvation of his soul. The third part, followed by a homily, details Leopold's commemoration. The final section is about the farewell and about eternal rest.  History and words  The choice of Bach for the funeral music was not surprising. He had worked full-time at Leopold's court between 1717 and 1723. When he moved to Leipzig, he retained a role as court composer. His commissions in the period 1723‚Äì29 included the 1726 secular cantata Steigt freudig in die Luft, BWV 36a, to celebrate the birthday of Princess Charlotte, Leopold's wife, who was to survive the deaths of her husband and two children from smallpox. Although the prince's death took place in 1728, his funeral was delayed until March the following year. Presumably the delay in burying the prince gave Bach a reasonable amount of time to compose the Trauermusik (funeral music). However, he chose to adapt material he had already composed, rather than create something completely new. While no score survives for the cantata as such, there is evidence of how Bach set the text, which was by Picander, a librettist Bach had been working with since his move to Leipzig.Experience St Matthew Passion in brief (2013), Oslo Internasjonale kirkemusikkfestival It has been demonstrated that Bach used music from an earlier funeral ode (to a text by Johann Christoph Gottsched) and music from the St Matthew Passion (to a text by Picander), which \\"fit\\" the words of the funeral text. (see Reconstructions section below) Picander's text for the funeral music exists in three different versions.1).

Performance history  = First performance = The court at Kothen and St James' church were Calvinist and therefore not usually a venue for elaborate music. On 23 March 1729 the prince's body was transferred from the court chapel to St James' church, for burial in the crypt. There is documentary evidence that the cantata was performed at a memorial service the following day, but it has been suggested by Andrew Parrott that part of the cantata would have been appropriate for the burial service. There is also documentary evidence regarding the performers, which throws light on the scoring. The composer's wife, Anna Magdalena Bach was soprano soloist and Christian Ferdinand Abel was probably a soloist on viola da gamba.Catherine Bott, Andrew Parrott (October 2011) Reconstructions (Discussion of work in question starts about minute 12), The Early Music Show, BBC Radio 3. Retrieved 2014-08-28. = Reconstructions = The possibility of a reconstruction arose when the nineteenth-century scholar Wilhelm Rust discovered that Bach in part built the Trauermusik with movements from two other works:Bach-Gesamtausgabe (BGA), Volume 20/2, p. X ff. * the Trauer-Ode for the Electress of Saxony La√ü, F√ºrstin, la√ü noch einen Strahl, BWV 198 *the St Matthew Passion Bach sometimes reused an earlier composition, typically revising and improving it in a process called parody. Exactly how Bach recycled his music in this case is open to interpretation. However, Bach may have simply given his musicians music sheets from the existing works to save copying another set. This possibility is discussed by Andrew Parrott. Bach is believed to have used the same sheet music for different works when, for example, he recycled Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV 134a. The close relationship between the Passion and the Trauermusik for Prince Leopold is reflected in their sharing a number in the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV), the standard catalogue of Bach's works. However, the relationship is complicated by the fact that, although the first performance of the Passion appears to predate the Trauermusik, the Passion was revised by Bach for later performances. Several reconstructions exist: * Polish musicologist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gnat reconstructed in 1999 all parts except recitatives, which were to be performed by a speaker. The performance took place on 24 March 1999 (270th anniversary of original performance) in Franciscan Church in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland with the baroque orchestra, led by Marcin Sompoli≈Ñski. Marcin Sompoli≈Ñski * The German musicologist Hans Gr√º√ü reconstructed in 2000 all arias and most of the choruses. In this version the text of the recitatives has to be performed by a speaker. * The first complete reconstruction was made by Andrew Parrott and first performed under his direction by the New York Collegium in 2004. Six years later Parrott made a recording of this edition with the UK-based Taverner Consort and Players (see recording section below).Andrew Parrott, J. S. Bach's Trauer-Music for Prince Leopold: clarification and reconstruction, Early Music 39/4 (November 2011) * The German harpsichordist Alexander Ferdinand Grychtolik made an edition of another full reconstruction of the Trauermusik in 2010. In this version most of the recitatives of the Trauermusik are adapted from accompagnato recitatives of the St Matthew Passion. This reconstruction is based on the assumption of German musicologist that there is a parody connection not only between arias and choruses, but also between the accompagnato recitatives of both works.Gojowy, Detlef: Zur Frage der K√∂thener Trauermusik und der Matth√§uspassion, in: Bach-Jahrbuch 1965, p. 86 ff. and p. 131 ff.

A bushy shrub intermediate between its parents in habit, leaf shape and flower colour, it is known only from road verges in the Scott River area, where its parent species co-occur. Despite its hybrid origin, it is fertile. This hybrid was first recognised in 1979, but it was not formally described and published until 1986. It is considered an attractive shrub with significant horticultural potential. Description Morphologically, A. √ó pamela is intermediate between its two parent species. It grows as a bushy shrub about 1.5 m (5 ft) in height, roughly twice the height of the compact A. obovata, but shorter than the tall, lanky A. detmoldii. Leaf shape is also intermediate between the short obovate leaves of A. obovata, and the longer lanceolate leaves of A. detmoldii; and flowers are orange or light red, again intermediate between the yellow to orange of A. detmoldii and the scarlet of A obovata. Like A. obovata, A. √ó pamela possesses a lignotuber. Systematics Of the six putative Adenanthos hydrids reported to date, this is the only one known from more than one or two plants. Over twenty individuals have been seen. Moreover the species is fertile: the pollen is reported to be less than 50% fertile, yet plants bore plenty of seed when inspected in December 1984. This raises the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm. The existence of this hybrid was first reported by Greg Keighery in 1979, but Keighery did not publish a binomial for it. The subsequent discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Ernest Charles Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Nelson chose the epithet pamela in honour of his friend Pamela Sanderson, an amateur botanist active in the Albany Wildflower Society, in whose company he visited the area to collect specimens in 1984. As a hybrid between two members of Adenanthos sect. Eurylaema, A. √ó pamela is itself placed in that section. No attempt was made to represent its hybrid parentage in the taxonomic sequence given in Nelson's 1995 taxonomic arrangement of Adenanthos; it was simply placed at the end of the section. Thus its placement in that arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema :::A. detmoldii :::A. barbiger :::A. obovatus :::A. √ó pamela ::A. sect. Adenanthos (29 species, 8 subspecies) Distribution and habitat Adenanthos √ó pamela is restricted to the Scott River areas, where the parent species co-occur, and has only been found growing with both parents. It is known only from about twenty scattered individuals growing on road verges, particularly Governor Broome Road, east of Scott River National Park. Cultivation Nelson describes Adenanthos √ó pamela as \\"an attractive shrub, with considerable potential as a garden plant.\\" Kings Park and Botanic Garden have successfully cultivated the species from cuttings collected from native plants.

He was the fourth son and sixth child of William I, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg and Juliana of Stolberg. He was the second youngest brother of William the Silent. Life He studied at Wittenberg and in 1566 fought against the Turks, then pushing into Europe. In 1568 his brother William the Silent took up arms against Philip II of Spain and Adolf fought beside him in Brabant. Adolf then joined the force under his brother Louis of Nassau in the north, where he died at the battle of Heiligerlee. The Spanish troops at Heiligerlee were commanded by Arenberg. Heiligerlee was a Dutch victory, but this was nullified when Alva beheaded counts Egmont and Horne in Brussels on 5 June 1568. = Death at Heiligerlee = The death of Adolf of Nassau is mentioned in the Dutch national anthem (4th verse): :Graef Adolff is ghebleven, In Vriesland in den slaech, :\\"Count Adolf has died, in Friesland, in the battle\\"  The Graaf Adolfmonument  Monument to the battle of Heiligerlee by Joseph Geefs, from a design by J.H. Egenberger The first monument to Adolf was a simple truncated obelisk with an urn, created in 1826. It was poorly maintained and, by 1868, was badly deteriorated. That year, it was torn down and a contest was organized to design a replacement for Adolf's three-hundredth anniversary. The winning design was by the history painter J.H. Egenberger, in conjunction with Pieter Schenkenberg van Mierop (1837-1904), an architect who later emigrated to the United States. The design features a dying Adolf, protected by the Dutch Maiden. The contract for executing the statue was given to the Belgian sculptor, Joseph Geefs. Originally, Van Mierop wanted the monument to be placed on a stone hill but, after some disagreement, Geefs designed an octagonal pedestal. The first foundation stone was laid on May 23, 1868, by William, Prince of Orange and Prince Henry. On the same day, five years later, the monument was unveiled by King William III.

It was designed by Robin Dods and built from 1912 to 1914 by Thomas Keenan. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. History The original St Brigid's Red Hill church was blessed and opened on 30 December 1882. It replaced an earlier stone structure built in 1877. As the parish grew to be one of the largest in Brisbane, a larger church was needed to accommodate 1000 people. The current Church's foundation stone was laid on 5 May 1912 and it was built from 1912 to 1914. The parish was largely composed of poor Irish immigrants so that the church became a focal point of the Irish Catholic cause in Queensland. = Opening ceremony = Dedication ceremony at St Brigids Catholic Church, 1914 The church was dedicated and opened on 9 August 1914. The opening ceremony was a significant occasion in the life of the Catholic community in Brisbane, attended by Archbishop of Melbourne Daniel Mannix and presided over by Archbishop of Brisbane James Duhig. The construction of St Brigid's was regarded as the coming of age of Catholicism in Brisbane. For Duhig, who was to become renowned as a prolific builder of churches and schools, St Brigid's was an auspicious beginning. = School = The St Brigid's School no longer operates. The nearest school is the Petrie Terrace State School down the hill to the south in Paddington.  Current use  St Brigid's Church is part of the Jubilee Catholic Parish including seven churches and three schools in the inner western suburbs of Brisbane. = Parish newsletter = Newsletters for the Jubilee Parish provide contact details and further information on the Parish.  Description  = Position = St Brigid's Church is significant as it is an icon on the inner Brisbane skyline, visible from all directions. The church is prominently situated high on Red Hill, unconventionally oriented north-south, to terminate the vista along George Street (now lost since the construction of the Brisbane Transit Centre). Its hilltop position, close to the city centre, makes it a Brisbane landmark. St Brigid's Church is significant as an example of Archbishop Duhig's efforts to place churches in prominent positions throughout Brisbane, and as a symbol of the emerging confidence of Catholicism in Queensland which was dominated by Irish immigrants at the time. = Architecture = It is a brick fortress-like building, rectangular, with the chancel, entrance porch and its flanking buttresses semi-octagonal in shape. A single-storeyed vestry protrudes off the west side of the chancel. A single-storeyed vestry protrudes off the west side of the chancel. Its design by Robert Smith Dods (commonly known as Robin S. Dods) was inspired by St Ceciles Cathedral at Albi, France, which the parish building committee had chosen as the model for St Brigid's. It is an outstanding example, both internally and externally, of the architecture of Robin Dods, It reflects the influence of some of the design theories current in Europe during Dods's early career in Edinburgh, in particular the Arts and Crafts use of materials and the picturesque approach to landscape and siting. Many features of the building, including the high proportions, opening windows with balconies, arches, French doors, and the open chancel area, contribute to a cool environment. The original plan included a tower above the chancel but this was not built for lack of funds. LJ Harvey's life size statue of St Brigid above the entrance porch, holds a model of the completed church. = Interior = The interior of St Brigid's is austere and simple in decoration yet grand in dimensions. The detailing and workmanship in brick, stone, wood, glass and metal are austere but refined. Notable features include the timber ceiling, light fittings, gallery, organ, altars and stained glass. However, the original silky oak and leadlight doors running the length of the nave on the east and west walls, and some other fixed glazing, have been replaced with fully glazed areas which allow excessive light into the interior at floor level. = Pipe organ = St Brigid's contains a recently renovated pipe organ in the choir loft that fills the church.  Heritage listing  St Brigids Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Brigids Church is significant as an example of Duhig's efforts to place churches in prominent positions throughout Brisbane and as a symbol of the emerging confidence of Catholicism in Queensland which was dominated by Irish immigrants at the time. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. St Brigids Church is significant as a characteristic part of the inner Brisbane skyline, visible from all directions. It is an outstanding example, both internally and externally, of the architecture of Robin Dods, a recognised member of the contemporary Arts and Crafts movement in Europe and the United States of America. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. St Brigids Church is significant as a self-conscious townscape composition designed to place an acropolis-like skyline on the axis of George Street and for the impressive quality of the interior which is derived from the carefully considered combination of materials, light and scale.
