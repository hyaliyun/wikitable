Gates' brother Bill was also a professional footballer who played for Middlesbrough from 1961‚Äì1973. Club careerIpswich Town= Gates made his debut for Ipswich Town as an eighteen-year-old on 27 October 1973 at Portman Road replacing Roger Osborne during a 2‚Äì0 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers in front of a crowd of 20,882. Gates would make a further 16 substitute appearances before he made his full debut against Derby County at The Baseball Ground in October 1975. Gates' first goal as a professional footballer came later that month in a 3-0 UEFA Cup victory against FC Bruges at Portman Road in the 1st leg of the 2nd round. Highlights of Gates' time at Ipswich Town include both goals in a 2‚Äì1 over FC Barcelona at Portman Road in the first leg of the 1979 Cup Winners Cup quarter final. Gates contributed to Ipswich's victorious 1977-78 FA Cup campaign, making one appearance during the run against Cardiff City in the third round. However he wasn't part of the squad for the final itself. Gates' greatest moment was as part of the team that won the 1981 UEFA Cup Final against AZ Alkmaar, starting both legs of the final. Gates' final game came in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to West Ham United at Portman Road on 17 May 1985. He started 345 times for Ipswich Town with another 39 appearances as a substitute, under Bobby Robson, scoring 96 goals at an average of 1 goal every 4 games. =Sunderland= In 1985, he moved to Sunderland for ¬£150,000 on a wave of optimism on Wearside following the appointment of Lawrie McMenemy as manager. Gates' debut came on the opening day of the season at Roker Park on 17 August 1985 in front of a 21,208 crowd that witnessed a 2‚Äì0 victory for the visitors Blackburn Rovers. His first goal for The Black Cats came in a 3‚Äì3 draw at home to Grimsby Town on 7 September 1985. That first season for Gates at Roker Park however proved to be an unhappy one with Sunderland finishing 18th only two places above the relegation zone. If Gates' first season had been an unhappy one, his second proved to be a disaster as Sunderland were relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history following a play-off defeat to Gillingham Gates had found the net twice in the second leg, ultimately to no avail. Gates' third season at Sunderland under new manager Denis Smith was anything but an unhappy one, Sunderland strolled to the league title with over 90 points and 90 goals Gates scored 19 of those league goals missing only 4 league games alongside his new strike partner Marco Gabbiadini who had followed manager Denis Smith from York City earlier that summer. That strike partnership is known in Wearside folklore as The G-Force. Highlights for Gates that season included scoring four goals in a 7‚Äì0 victory over Southend United at Roker Park on 3 November 1987, a hat-trick in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Rotherham United again at Roker Park on 20 December 1987 and a goal in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Northampton Town which clinched the title for Sunderland in front of a crowd of 29,454 at Roker Park on 2 May 1988. Gates' penultimate season at Sunderland saw him only finding the net 4 times in the league as Sunderland finished the season in 11th place. The final season for Gates on Wearside proved to be one of success. Gates played 39 times scoring 7 goals helping Sunderland to promotion back to the top flight. Gates scored two goals twice that season helping Sunderland to crucial league wins, however the thing Gates is most remembered for at Roker Park is scoring the opening goal in the biggest Tyne-Wear derby in history on 16 May 1990, which helped Sunderland clinch a 2-0 play-off second leg victory over Newcastle United at St James' Park in the process securing Sunderland's third Wembley appearance. Gates' final appearance for The Wearsiders would come at Wembley against Swindon Town in the play-off final on 28 May 1990 in front of a crowd of 72,873. Although Swindon Town won the game 1-0 through a Gary Bennett own goal, Sunderland went on to claim their place in the First Division as Swindon were refused entry due to a series of financial irregularities by the Swindon Town board. In total Gates made 219 appearances, 20 of which from the bench, scoring 55 goals at an average of 1 goal every 3.98 games. =Carlisle United= In 1990, he left Sunderland for Carlisle United for his final season in league football, scoring a respectable 8 times in 38 appearances, a goal every 4.75 games. Gates' career came to an end in a bizarre circumstances, after the Carlisle United manager had firstly annoyed Gates by making him travel to Brunton Park to catch the team coach for a midweek away fixture rather than catch it as it passed his home some sixty miles away, Gates then found himself to be on the bench. With only a few minutes of the match remaining on the cold wet night the manager told Gates to get warmed up, with no further ado Gates rose from the bench to proceed straight down the tunnel, stripped off and jumped straight into the bath. In all, Gates played 519 games and scored 127 goals at league level. 1 goal every 4.09 games. International career Gates received two caps for the England national side in 1980. Gates made his International debut on 10 September 1980 against Norway in a 4-0 World Cup qualifying victory, his only other international appearance coming in a 2-1 World Cup qualifying defeat against Romania in Bucharest. Life after football After retiring from football Gates worked for Century FM North East (now Real Radio North East) on The Legends Football Phone-In until May 2007, when he allegedly attempted to join BBC Radio Newcastle.

Caffyn was born in Reigate in Surrey in 1828 and died in 1919 aged 91 in the town. He made five appearances for New South Wales, two for Kent and one for Lancashire as well as appearing five times for Marylebone Cricket Club.Billy Caffyn, CricketArchive. Retrieved 2017-04-15. Surrey and All-England Caffyn was a genuine all-rounder: a sound middle-order right-handed batsman and a very effective right-arm medium-fast roundarm bowler. He played a major part in the success of Surrey during the 1850s. Caffyn's known first-class career extended from 1849 to 1873. He took 602 wickets in 200 matches at an average of 13.47 runs each with a best analysis of 9/29. He took five wickets in an innings 49 times and 10 wickets in a match 11 times. He scored 5885 runs at an average of 17.99 with a highest score of 103, making 2 centuries. He took 149 catches. In 1860 whilst employed as a professional at Winchester College he played and beat an XI of the Town of Winchester single handed by 28 runs. Caffyn made scores of 35 and 1, and with two men fielding for him he bowled out the opposition for 4 and 4. The first English touring team pictured on board ship at Liverpool. Caffyn is standing second from left. At the end of the 1859 English cricket season, Caffyn was one of the 12 players who took part in cricket's first-ever overseas tour when an England cricket team led by George Parr visited North America. Australia Caffyn was instrumental in the early development of Australian cricket and the establishment of Anglo-Australian competition. Known in England as the Surrey Pet, he came to Australia with a sponsored 1861/62 team which consisted of mainly Surrey cricketers, and again in 1864. For both of these trips, Caffyn and the team travelled to Melbourne on the SS Great Britain.https://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/36632 Following this he stayed on as coach of the Melbourne Cricket Club. After a term in Melbourne, he moved to Sydney, where he started a hairdressing business with his wife and coached at the Warwick Club. During this time he was closely associated with fellow ex-Surrey professional cricketer Charles Lawrence who coached at the Albert Cricket Club in Sydney. In his book Seventy-one Not Out he wrote: : The cricket out there in the ten years that have elapsed between the first visit of an English eleven and my leaving the country had made phenomenal improvement... It is a source of the greatest satisfaction to me that I have in some measure contributed to the successful state of things. Caffyn has the distinction of bowling the first ball in the first match between a team from England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground which took place on New Year's Day in 1862 in which his visiting England XI were up against a Victorian XVIII.http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=historydisplay&articleid;=48 He also played in the first Anglo-Australian first-class cricket match, played from 1 March 1862 and dubbed The World v Surrey, also at the MCG.Cricket Archive at cricketarchive.com The first Test match was not played until 15 years later in March 1877. He returned to England in May 1871 and died at his home in Surrey at the age of 91.

James W. Papez Oral History Collection. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1981 or medial limbic circuit, is a neural circuit for the control of emotional expression. In 1937, James Papez proposed that the circuit connecting the hypothalamus to the limbic lobe was the basis for emotional experiences. Paul D. MacLean reconceptualized Papez's proposal and coined the term limbic system. MacLean redefined the circuit as the \\"visceral brain\\" which consisted of the limbic lobe and its major connections in the forebrain ‚Äì hypothalamus, amygdala, and septum. Over time, the concept of a forebrain circuit for the control of emotional expression has been modified to include the prefrontal cortex. Recent studies show that it has a more significant role in memory functions than in emotions. Some of the structures that Papez originally described such as the hippocampus now appear to have little to do with emotional behavior.  Structure  thumb  alt=Inferior Medial View of a Dissected Brain  In a dissected brain, the inferior medial view shows the curved shape of the structures of the Papez circuit in the brain. The Papez circuit involves various structures of the brain. It begins and ends with the hippocampus (or the hippocampal formation). Fiber dissection indicates that the average size of the circuit is 350 millimeters. The Papez circuit goes through the following neural pathways: : Hippocampal formation (subiculum)‚Üí fornix‚Üí mammillary bodies‚Üí mammillothalamic tract‚Üí anterior thalamic nucleus‚Üí cingulum‚Üí entorhinal cortex‚Üí hippocampal formation.Shah, A., Jhawar, S. S., & Goel, A. (2012). Analysis of the anatomy of the Papez circuit and adjoining limbic system by fiber dissection techniques. [Article]. Journal of Clinical Neuroscience, 19(2), 289-298. . A photograph of the inferior medial view of the brain when dissected clearly shows the layout of the Papez circuit. Due to the location of the structures in the circuit, the resulting shape is a limbus. This is what drove MacLean to call the circuit the limbic system when he later modified the circuit. Various studies indicate that the Papez circuit is greatly influenced by the cerebellum and that perhaps the hippocampus is not the starting point of the circuit. Anatomically, this would make sense since the cerebellum is connected to the circuit with many fine fibers and fiber bundles. Chemical lesions on the cerebellum seem to have an inhibitory effect on the circuit. Animal behavioral studies show that electrical stimulation of the anterior cerebellum can cause arousal, predatory attack, and feeding responses, all of which are thought to be expressions of emotion. Overall, these studies provide evidence that the cerebellum may also be included in an emotional system of the brain.Snider, R. S., & Maiti, A. (1976). CEREBELLAR CONTRIBUTIONS TO PAPEZ CIRCUIT. Journal of Neuroscience Research, 2(2), 133-146. .  Function  Emotion = A heuristic model of the neural pathway of the Papez circuit shows the connections between its different parts. Based on Papez's experiment with aggression in rats and other studies, it was initially believed that the circuit was involved with emotion. The circuit connects the hypothalamus and the cortex and acts as the emotional system of the brain. \\"The cingulate cortex projects to the hippocampus, and the hippocampus projects to the hypothalamus by way of the bundle of axons called the fornix. Hypothalamic effects reach the cortex via a relay in the anterior thalamic nuclei.\\"Bear, Mark F., Connors, Barry W., & Paradiso, Michael A. (2006). Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain (3rd ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. However, there has not been additional proof of the circuit's role in emotion over the years. Now, the Amygdala is thought to play a key role in emotion, a structure that was not a part of the Papez circuit until 1952 when MacLean included it in the modified version of the circuit, the limbic system. = Memory = In the past few years, many experiments have been done that involve structures of the Papez circuit. Moreover, many cases where structures of the Papez circuit have been damaged show changes that indicate its real function. Theta waves are used to measure activity in mainly the hippocampus but can be used to measure other brain regions as well. Strong synchronization of theta waves in the hippocampus and anterior ventral thalamus has been observed. Although theta waves between the hippocampus and the anterior dorsal and anterior medial regions in the thalamus showed no synchronization, scientists have seen a marked increase in firing rates of the neurons in the brain regions.Vertes, R. P., Albo, Z., & Di Prisco, G. V. (2001). Theta- rhythmically firing neurons in the anterior thalamus: Implications for mnemonic functions of Papez's circuit. [Letter]. Neuroscience, 104(3), 619-625. . Overall, based on theta wave experimentation, some components of the Papez circuit have shown to indeed have a connection and work together. Also, theta waves are thought to be linked to learning and memory. Consequently, many scientists believe that the Papez circuit is involved with memory because of theta wave experiments. Some scientists have narrowed it down to specifically spatial and episodic memory.Albo, Zimbul, Di Prisco, Gonzalo Viana, & Vertes, Robert P. (2011). Multisite Spike-Field Coherence, Theta Rhythmicity, and Information Flow Within Papez's Circuit. In R. P. Vertes & R. W.

Varieties of memory: Systems, structures, mechanisms of disturbance. [Review]. Neurology Psychiatry and Brain Research, 5(1), 37-56. Damage to the mammillothalamic tract, ventral anterior nucleus, and ventral lateral nucleus can result in memory and language impairment.Nishio, Y., Hashimoto, M., Ishii, K., & Mori, E. (2011). Neuroanatomy of a neurobehavioral disturbance in the left anterior thalamic infarction. [Article]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 82(11), 1195-1200. .

The role of the Mammillary bodies in memory: A case of amnesia following bilateral resection. [Article]. European Journal of Psychiatry, 20(2), 88-95. The fornix is a bundle of nerve tracts made of white matter. It is crucial in normal cognitive functions. Harm to the fornix can result in amnesia.Thomas, A. G., Koumellis, P., & Dineen, R. A. (2011). The Fornix in Health and Disease: An Imaging Review. [Review]. Radiographics, 31(4), 1107-1121. . Clinical significance thumbright  alt=Comparison of the brain of a healthy human and of an Alzheimer's patient.  Compared to a healthy individual, Alzheimer's patients experience significantly more brain loss. The neurodegenerative effects of the disease can be seen by comparing the brains of a healthy individual and an Alzheimer's patient. = Alzheimer's disease = Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease and a form of dementia. It leaves patients impaired or unable to learn new information. They usually have difficulty coming up with the names of people, objects, etc. Degeneration or other neural problems because of this disease commonly occurs in parts of the Papez circuit. It is already known that problems with episodic memory are linked to tumors or damage in the Papez circuit. Specific structures of the Papez circuit linked to episodic memory are the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures. As a result of these adverse effects on episodic memory, damage to the Papez circuit can not only indicate or predict amnesia but also Alzheimer's in a patient.Carlesimo, G. A. (2012). Memory disorders in patients with cerebral tumors. Journal of Neuro-Oncology, 108(2), 253-256. . = Parkinson's disease = Parkinson's disease is caused by the degeneration of the substantia nigra in the midbrain. There may also be damage to the structures of the Papez circuit in this disease. Usually, Parkinson's is correlated with depletion of dopamine in the basal ganglia.Budson, A., & Price, B. (2001). Memory: Clinical Disorders Encyclopedia of Life Sciences: Macmillan Publishers Ltd, Nature Publishing Group. = Semantic dementia = Semantic dementia is a rare degenerative disorder that exhibits defects in all semantic memory functions, including naming, single word comprehension and impoverished general knowledge, with relative preservation of other components of speech, perceptual and nonverbal problem-solving skills, and episodic memory. This may occur due to damage in the mammillary bodies, ventral anterior nucleus, and ventral lateral nucleus which has resulted in disruption in language in previous research. = Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome = Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome occurs when a chronic alcoholic patient suffers from poor nutrition and specifically develops a thiamine deficiency. Usually with this disease, there are widespread abnormalities in the Papez and fronto-cerebellar circuits.Pitel, A. L., Aupee, A. M., Chetelat, G., Mezenge, F., Beaunieux, H., de la Sayette, V., . . . Desgranges, B. (2009). Morphological and Glucose Metabolism Abnormalities in Alcoholic Korsakoff's Syndrome: Group Comparisons and Individual Analyses. [Article]. PLoS ONE, 4(11). . The mammillary bodies are an important part of the Papez circuit. If there is damage, such as loss of neurons and/or myelination, to the mammillary bodies, the Papez circuit can be severely affected. There will be a disruption in the connecting parts of the system. As a result, the ability to learn new information or to retrieve recently acquired memories is significantly reduced or lost. = Transient global amnesia = Transient global amnesia is a very rare disorder and not much is known about it. Patients acutely develop a selective disorder of episodic memory, losing from several to 48 hours of previously learned information and are unable to learn new information. Damage to the hippocampus and other medial lobe structures in the Papez circuit is thought to be the cause of reduced or lost episodic memory.  History  Neuroscientist Paul D. MacLean is famous for his work on the limbic system and its evolutionary history. In 1907/1908, Bavarian neuropathologist Christfried Jakob discovered the visceral brain. By date, he held the \\"... first interpretation of the limbic or ‚Äòinternal‚Äô brain as a viscero-emotional mechanism...\\" He traced the structures of the system based on degeneration experiments in apes and dogs as well as neurodegenerative diseases in humans.Triarhou, L. C. (2008). Centenary of Christfried Jakob's discovery of the visceral brain: An unheeded precedence in affective neuroscience. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 32(5), 984-1000. However, it was not until 1937 when James Papez studied this system in detail that it became famous. Papez had been studying cases of rabies which is a disease that causes high levels of aggression. He noticed that this heightened aggression correlated with damage to the hippocampus.Eysenck, M. (2004). Psychology: An International Perspective: Taylor & Francis. Theoretically, this made sense to Papez who asserted that the hippocampus is responsible for the expression of emotion because of its connection to the autonomic nervous system. He also noticed that in other cases, certain stimuli (taste, smell, pain, etc.) would cause strong emotional responses. These stimuli activated not only the hippocampus but also other brain structures. He theorized that these brain structures worked together as the emotional control center in the brain and consequently founded the Papez circuit.Klein, S. B., & Thorne, B. M. (2006). Biological Psychology: Worth Publishers. Because of these studies, Papez strongly believed that the circuit was the cortical control of emotion. Around the same time, Paul D. MacLean was also interested in the Papez circuit. He had read through Paul Broca's research which indicated that the limbic lobe that surrounds the brainstem is a structure present in all mammals. Papez's paper on the emotional circuit which involved the connection between the hypothalamus and the limbic lobe set MacLean on a journey to learn more. He visited Papez at Cornell University after which he proposed a modified version of the Papez circuit in 1952, emphasizing not only the hippocampus, but also the amygdala and septum.Newman, J. D., & Harris, J. C. (2009). The Scientific Contributions of Paul D. MacLean (1913-2007). The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 197(1). The hippocampus, amygdala, and septum make up the rhinencephalon (frontotemporal portion of the brain) or, as Jakob termed it, the visceral brain. Together, the limbic lobe and the visceral brain make up the limbic system. MacLean believed that including the visceral brain in the limbic system accounted for the external sensory information associated with subjective emotional experiences. Since the limbic system consists of evolutionary primitive structures which prevents its interpretation verbally, the visceral brain accounts for the visual, auditory, olfactory, and other external sensory inputs that are associated with emotions. Recently, many studies have been done to analyze the anatomy and function of the Papez circuit. Many scientists have been finding proof that the circuit is related to memory as well as emotion. The limbic system, the modified version of the circuit proposed by MacLean, is thought to be involved in the same functions as well as behavior, motivation, and olfaction.Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia  References  Category:Limbic system Category:Thalamus Category:Hippocampus (brain) ","title":"Papez circuit"},{"id":"2473068","text":"Vapour phase decomposition (VPD) is a method used in the semiconductor industry to improve the sensitivity of total-reflection x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy by changing the contaminant from a thin layer (which has an angle-dependent fluorescence intensity in the TXRF-domain) to a granular residue. When using granular residue the limits of detection are improved because of a more intense fluorescence signal in angles smaller than the isokinetic angle.  Method  When using granular residue the limits of detection are improved because of a more intense fluorescence signal in angles smaller than the isokinetic angle. This can be achieved by enhancing the impurity concentration in the solution to be analyzed. In standard atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), the impurity is dissolved together with the matrix element. In VPD, the surface of the wafer is exposed to hydrofluoric acid vapour, which causes the surface oxide to dissolve together with the impurity metals. The acid droplets, condensed on the surface, are then analyzed using AAS.  Advantages  The method has yielded good results for the detection and measurement of nickel and iron. To improve the range of elemental impurities and lower detection limits, the acid droplets obtained from the silicon wafers are analyzed by ICP-MS (Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). This technique, VPD ICP-MS provides accurate measurement of up to 60 elements and detection limits of in the range of 1E6-E10 atoms/sq.cm on the silicon wafer.  Related Techniques  One related technique is VPD-DC (vapour phase decomposition-droplet collection), where the wafer is scanned with a droplet that collects the metal ions that were dissolved in the decomposition step. This procedure affords better limits of detection when applying AAS in order to detect metal impurities of very small concentrations on wafer surfaces.

The 350-seat school auditorium is used for school assemblies, teacher and parent functions, fine arts productions and concerts and is fully equipped with lighting and sound systems. The auditorium was completely renovated in 2016. Music students are offered a range of facilities from band, strings and choir rooms to soundproofed practice, instrument, choral and strings rooms. In elementary and middle school, there are about 20 (ES) to 20 (MS) students per homeroom. There are four to five homerooms in each grade. In high school, there are about 12 to 20 students per class. In the school year of 2017-2018, the average class size is 15.0 for all classes and 15.2 for Advanced Placement classes. Every year, 100% of the graduating class matriculate into colleges and universities, with the majority going to the United States upon graduation along with a few students moving on to Korean universities. Less than 5% of them graduate to different countries, mostly to Korea, Japan, or China.  Academics  The grade average of students is at around 3.8 out of a 4-point GPA scale. These criterion-referenced grades are fully supported by external metrics of successful educational outcomes on AP exams, the SAT and ACT, college acceptances to the most competitive schools in the world (including Princeton, Yale, Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Penn, Chicago, CalTech and many more, just in the recent years 2015-2017) Advanced Placement (AP) courses are also offered at SIS in high school and students are encouraged to take any of the 22 offered courses. SIS also offers non-academic courses, including classes in art, drama, and music. There are many non-AP classes including a wide variety of arts, music and design classes, government, statistics, anatomy, mathematical functions and models, history, communications, life sports and many, many others. The school also offers the AP Capstone program classes in Seminar and Research as of the 2016-2017 school year. Course Choices (Languages) For foreign language courses, students are given two options of Chinese and Spanish. There are 5 levels for language courses, from 1 to 4 and an AP course. For English, students are required to take two English courses until their senior year. Freshmen take General Literature and Communications, sophomores take American Literature and writing 10, juniors take British Literature and writing 11 or AP Language, and seniors are given an option of AP Language or AP Literature. Outside of the academic curriculum, there are myriad of options that you could learn foreign languages from student-run clubs. A lot of students are involved in teaching Korean for foreigners after school.  Sports  Seoul International School is a Division 1, but primarily Division 2 member of the Korean-American Interscholastic Activities Conference. SIS fields teams in tennis, cross country, and swimming for Division 1 and volleyball, basketball, cheerleading, and soccer for Division 2.  Student life and activities Middle school = Sports  In middle school, there are six sports that students can choose to be part of. Some occur in the same season.http://sismiddleschoolsports.weebly.com/index.html * Soccer * Cross Country * Swimming * Volleyball * Table Tennis * Basketball  Advisory and electives  Advisory is a period that allows students to meet with their homeroom teacher and interact through activities and games. It was established with the aim that students will bond with their teachers and engage in a non- academic environment. Middle school students have multiple electives that they can choose from. The list includes MS Global Issues Network (GIN), Drama, Music (Band, Choir, or Strings), Art, Yoga, and more. The electives allow students to explore and pursue various non-academic courses.  Student council (MSSC)  Officers that make up the student council are elected through a democratic process. Speeches are made in front of the entire middle school student body and each individual votes for the candidates of their choosing. MSSC is in charge of organizing multiple events, including an annual carnival that is hosted towards the end of the school year. = High school = The high school has a faculty of over 50 teachers. The high school offers over 22 AP classes in 55 different sections, including the AP Capstone Diploma, which the school has adopted for the 2016-2017 school year and onward. The current administration and faculty is led by Dr. Jim Gerhard, a long-time international school educator who has taught and led schools in many different countries.  Clubs  There are numerous student organizations in high school. Clubs play an important role in high school as students commit their time to multiple clubs. The existing clubs include UNICEF, Habitat for Humanity (HFH), Global Issues Network (GIN), Mu Alpha Theta (MAT), Primary English Teacher Association (PETA), Green Club, National Honor Society (NHS), Korean Animal Service Association (KASA), North Korea Human Rights (NKHR), Tri-M Music Honor Society, Kaleidoscope, Seoulite, Model United Nations (MUN), Community Service Club, Science Club, Quill & Scroll, and more. Students are asked in the beginning of the year to fill out an application in order to apply for clubs of their choosing. Many commit to clubs in freshmen year and work to earn leadership positions in future years.

It was the follow-up to their commercial breakthrough Love. The album equalled its predecessor's chart placing by peaking at number four in the UK but exceeded its chart residency, spending a total of 27 weeks on the chart (the most successful run for an album by The Cult). The album marked a deliberate stylistic change in the band's sound from gothic rock to more traditional hard rock. Rick Rubin, the producer on Electric, had been specifically hired to remake the band's sound in an effort to capitalize on the popularity of hard rock and heavy metal in the 1980s. The album was featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2013 the album was re-released as a double CD set under the title Electric Peace, with one disc featuring the originally released album and the second containing the entire Peace album recorded during the Manor Sessions. Production After the breakthrough success of their second album, Love, the Cult began working on a follow-up with producer Steve Brown. In the summer of 1986, they recorded twelve tracks at the Manor Studio in Oxfordshire. These recordings, which came to be known as the Manor Sessions, were to make up a new album, tentatively entitled Peace. However upon completion of the recording sessions, the band decided that they were unhappy with the sound, and began to look for a new producer. The band went on to choose Rick Rubin, who was known for producing albums for hip hop artists and thrash metal band Slayer. These new recordings, with a slightly different track-list and running order, became the album that was released. Although all twelve of the Manor Sessions tracks were initially scrapped, four of them would turn up as B-sides to singles from Electric. A further five of them appeared on a limited edition EP, and with the release of Rare Cult in 2000, the rest of the unreleased Steve Brown-produced tracks were made available, albeit in a limited edition format. They were finally made available on a mainstream release in 2013 as part of the Electric Peace release. Critical reception Rolling Stone wrote that \\"despite the hovering shades of Zeppelin, Bon Scott and others, Electric does more than pilfer bygone metal mayhem. It swaggers, crunches and howls, all right, but it does so with irreverence (not surprising with raunch expert Rick Rubin behind the board).\\" Trouser Press wrote: \\"As sensually gratifying as it is cornball retro-moronic, Electric can lay claim to one of history‚Äôs worst versions of 'Born to Be Wild.'\\" Track listing All songs written by Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy, except where noted. # \\"Wild Flower\\" ‚Äì 3:37 # \\"Peace Dog\\" ‚Äì 3:34 # \\"Lil' Devil\\" ‚Äì 2:44 # \\"Aphrodisiac Jacket\\" ‚Äì 4:11 # \\"Electric Ocean\\" ‚Äì 2:49 # \\"Bad Fun\\" ‚Äì 3:33 # \\"King Contrary Man\\" ‚Äì 3:12 # \\"Love Removal Machine\\" ‚Äì 4:17 # \\"Born to Be Wild\\" (Mars Bonfire) ‚Äì 3:55 # \\"Outlaw\\" ‚Äì 2:52 # \\"Memphis Hip Shake\\" ‚Äì 4:01 =\\"Manor Sessions\\"/Peace track listing= Electric arose from the sessions for the unreleased Peace album.

The film stars Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy in the lead roles alongside Rene Russo, William Shatner, Pedro Damian and De Niro's real life daughter Drena De Niro. The film was released in the United States on March 15, 2002. Plot The film centers on two LAPD cops, Det. Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) and Officer Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy), who are paired for a reality police show and run into real trouble with a crime lord. Mitch breaks a news camera after a failed confrontation with a drug lord, who escapes by using a custom-built gun. Maxxis Television, the network that employed the cameraman, decides to sue the police department for $10 million, but will drop the lawsuit if Mitch agrees to star in a reality cop television show, which Trey later calls Showtime!. Trey enters the picture shortly after, as an LAPD officer who actually wants to be an actor while also trying to become a detective. He pays a friend to snatch the purse of the show's producer, Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), and then retrieves it after a staged fight scene. Even though the deception is embarrassingly revealed, Chase is impressed and signs Trey on anyway. It is quickly revealed that the show's producers have little interest in filming an actual police officer's existence; they build a mini- movie set in the middle of the station, and replace Mitch's nondescript personal car with a Humvee, while Trey drives a C5 Corvette. They also hire William Shatner (who once played T. J. Hooker) to give both men tips on how to act. Trey is eager to learn, Mitch is merely annoyed. Despite all this, Mitch tries to investigate the mysterious supergun, which is subsequently used by arms dealer Caesar Vargas to kill the drug dealer and his girlfriend. Through a clever ruse by Trey, they are able to get the arms dealer's name from the dead dealer's henchman. However, Vargas is less than cooperative, which causes a brawl at his nightclub. Trey and Mitch are able to defeat him and his henchmen, and subsequently have a relatively friendly conversation on their way home. Mitch's good humor evaporates when he finds that, in his absence, the Showtime producers have drastically remodeled his house and given him a retired K-9 dog as a pet. Vargas and his crew assault an armored car and kill the crew, then devastate the police who respond. Trey and Mitch arrive and are pulled into the shootout. When the attackers flee in a garbage truck, Mitch gives chase in a police car. In the ensuing mayhem, the car is rammed by the garbage truck, which winds up crashing into a construction site. Mitch, ironically, survives by jumping from the police car to Trey's sports car (he had previously denounced \\"hood-jumping\\" as a useless skill). In the wake of the disaster, the police chief pulls the plug on the show, suspends Mitch from duty and demotes Trey back to patrol. With the show ended, Mitch's car is returned and his apartment restored (but he refuses to return the dog, of which he has grown fond). While watching the final episode, Mitch calls Trey and apologizes for his actions and even offers him to help ask questions on the detective exam. But while doing so, Mitch sees one of his police colleagues at Vargas's nightclub. He and Trey investigate, finding that Vargas is selling the weapons at a gun show at the Bonaventure Hotel. Vargas flees with one of the weapons, taking Chase hostage in the process. The duo is able to rescue her, via a pocket pistol concealed in a Maxxis camera, but the ceiling of the room is shot. It is located just below the pool, so it floods, and Vargas is washed out the window to his death, Trey manages to save himself and Mitch by handcuffing them together. They wind up suspended from a broken beam outside the hotel. The movie ends with Trey promoted to detective, and that he and Mitch are now partners and still working together with a new case, and there are hints of a romance between Chase and Mitch. Showtime is revived and in its second season, this time with two young and attractive female officers, who are just as antagonistic as Mitch and Trey were.

Savage converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in his youth while living in England. He served a mission in Switzerland and eventually moved to the United States. In America he became interested in photography and began taking portraits for hire in the East. He traveled to Salt Lake City with his family and opened up his Art Bazar where he sold many of his photographs. Savage concentrated his photographic efforts primarily on family portraits, landscapes, and documentary views. He is best known for his 1869 photographs of the linking of the First Transcontinental Railroad at Promontory, Utah. Early life Middle-aged Savage bust portrait, c. 1860s Savage was born in Southampton, England, on August 16, 1832 to John and Ann, the first of four children. At the age of four, his clothing caught on fire from a stray burning woodchip, and he suffered bad burns. Rather than attend school, he peddled salt in Southampton and helped a coachmaker sharpen tools. On May 25, 1848 at age 15, he was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), to his parents' disapproval. Savage moved to the Isle of Wight to work as a fishmonger and helped the Mormons there to proselyte. He returned to Southampton and worked for William Eddington in a stationery shop from 1851 to 1852. Eddington also educated him; Savage later writing that Eddington \\"placed me as it were on the road to fame\\". Savage worked part-time as a secretary for the Southampton mission president, collecting and recording donations. In 1853, he was a full-time missionary for the church in Switzerland, where he learned to speak French and a little German. After 19 months he returned to England where he met Annie Adkins. In December 1855, he was appointed as an interpreter for French- speaking Italian Latter-day Saints who were emigrating to America through the LDS Church's perpetual emigration fund. The two were married on June 24, 1856, ten days after Annie's arrival. Savage worked in Samuel Booth's print shop and took odd jobs. He and his friend Stenhouse experimented with taking stereo graphic photos, which were the first stereo graphic photos of Long Island. It is likely that he received instruction from Edward Covington, a daguerrotyper in New York, among others. He went to Florence, Nebraska on a church assignment in 1859; while there, he started selling portraits. He met up with his family in Council Bluffs, Iowa, where he continued selling photographs. Early photography career A scenic view of a pass through bluffs with snowcapped mountains in the background, c. 1874 In the spring of 1860, with the Brown Company Savage traveled to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory with his family. He photographed the Mormon trail while travelling to Utah but no photographs have survived.In 1861 he established a photography studio with a partner, Marsena Cannon, an early Utah daguerreotypist and photographer. A year later, after Cannon moved to southern Utah, he established a partnership with artist George M. Ottinger. Ottinger and Savage helped to organize the Deseret Academy of Art, which was soon replaced by the University of Deseret. Ottinger painted scenery for the Salt Lake Theater and took photos of local buildings and landscapes. Savage became increasingly popular as a portrait photographer and prominent people in Utah commissioned him to take their photos. He was also an active member of the 20th ward, sang in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, joined the Nauvoo Legion, and lectured on various subjects at the local Literary Institute. Savage advertised in local newspapers to increase his business. Several times, he made a collage of the baby photographs he had taken over the years, and often families with featured children would buy a copy. To protect his work from copyright infringement, he retained the original glass plate negatives of his photographs, giving him more control over their use. Charles W. Carter joined Ottinger and Savage's photography studio at some point after November 1864, when Carter arrived in Salt Lake City. Carter started his own photography studio with J.B. Silvis sometime in 1867. Carter often printed and sold other photographers' work. Since it is difficult to determine whether some photographs from this time were taken by Carter or Savage, occasionally both photographers are credited. While Andrew J. Russell was documenting the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1868, he met and befriended Savage. The two photographers often took photographs of the same scenes within minutes of each other.  Initial railroad work and trip to New York City  Water and trees below a tall, sheer cliff, c. 1879‚Äì89 By 1866 Savage's Views of the Great West, a stereoscopic series, was sold by the Union Pacific and Denver & Rio Grande Western railroads. These railroads gave him a free pass to ride wherever he wanted. The same year he took a tour of major photography studios in the United States, both to improve his photography skills and to publish reproductions of his photos. In San Francisco, he met Carleton Watkins, who described his method for producing large works by placing developed negatives in a water bath until he was ready to finish them. Savage noted that Watkins's method was cumbersome, but envied his results. He traveled by boat to New York City, where progress in photography instruction and technology inspired him. While in New York City, he made an agreement with Samuel R. Wells, who sold photos that Savage took, while Savage sold Wells' publications in his photography studio back in Utah. Savage made similar agreements with other distributors. After having a darkroom wagon custom made, spending $3,400 on photographic supplies from E. and H.T. Anthony Co., he traveled with a group of Mormon settlers back to Salt Lake City. Most of his new supplies were lost when his wagon tipped over while crossing the Platte River on his return trip. Savage paid back some of the debt over nine years, but stopped paying when he was on the verge of bankruptcy. The company sued him, and after a long legal battle, the debt was settled in 1883. Savage photographed the linking of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific on Promontory Summit, at Promontory, Utah in 1869. This series is considered his most famous work. Other well-known Savage images include pictures of the Great Basin tribes, especially the Paiute and Shoshone. He photographed scenic areas of the West, including Yellowstone National Park, and Zion National Park, and created many images documenting the growth of Utah towns and cities. England-born artist Alfred Lambourne often painted scenes while Savage photographed. Savage also traveled extensively over western North America, taking pictures in areas of Canada and Mexico, and in areas from the Pacific Ocean to Nebraska in the Midwest. Most of Savage's archived photographs, produced by several different early photographic methods, were lost in 1883 in a disastrous studio fire. Many of Savage's photographs were reproduced in Harper's Weekly newspaper, starting when he left photographs with their offices on his tour of the United States. This partnership continued until 1870, when he began submitting photos to Leslie's Illustrated instead. In 1870 Savage received an invitation from Brigham Young to be part of Young's visit to the towns of southern Utah. Young's party left on February 25, to travel through Utah's \\"Dixie\\". Savage wrote of his experiences during this time in the Improvement Era. He also brought his photography equipment, photographing the main leaders of the trip as well as Little Zion Valley, known today as Zion National Park. Upon Savage's trip home, his five month old son, Enos, had become sick. Enos died shortly after Savage's return. Upon Savage's request, George Ottinger painted a picture of Enos for Annie. Finding solace in his work, Savage left for California a month after Enos' death.  Art Bazar  A scenic view of a lake in the foreground and tall, imposing rocks in the background. Back label- C.R. Savage, Art Bazar...Medals...1888.A scenic vi Savage's studio was booming by the mid-1870s. Many tourists arrived at his Pioneer Art Gallery to buy photographs of the West. Recognizing the need to develop art appreciation to bolster his clientele in Mormon culture, Savage built the Art Bazar. By the late 1870s demand for photographs was high, and Savage was travelling more frequently in search of photographic opportunities. He photographed the West by travelling on the Denver and Rio Grande Western, Union Pacific, Central Pacific, Utah Central, and other western railroads. Each one gave him a free pass to ride. Savage took a second wife in 1876, Mary Emma Fowler, a twenty-four-year-old who died five years later in 1881 of \\"pelvic cellulitis\\". Polygamous marriages were often common for members of the LDS Church. Three years after Mary's death, Savage married his third wife, Ellen Fenn. The passing of the Edmunds Act slowed the local economy in Salt Lake City; however, tourism kept Savage's Art Bazar financially secure. Many polygamists were arrested and prosecuted during this time. Savage was never arrested, but was assigned by religious officials to visit the Utah Territorial Prison and Utah Penitentiary to preach. As the Edmunds Act proved ineffective, Congress passed the Edmunds- Tucker Act, seizing LDS church property and assets. Savage traveled East to lobby against the Edmunds-Tucker Act. Ultimately, his efforts failed, and in an effort to become a state, LDS President Woodruff announced the 1890 Manifesto renouncing polygamy. Portrait of Savage, as published on Character Builder Magazine, 1904 By the 1880s, Savage's photographs were famous in many states. However, on June 26, 1883, the day he managed to become debt free, a fire burned down the Art Bazar. The origin of the fire is still unknown. The fire destroyed his glass-plate negative collection, and his famous photographs could no longer be reproduced. Savage estimated the damage to be worth upwards of $12,000 but the insurance policy only covered $4,000. The community rallied together in order to fund and build a new studio. With the community's help and a small loan, Savage opened a new Art Bazar six months later. To advertise for the new Art Bazar, he started publishing a newspaper called The Busy Bee. The newspaper promoted his business as well as other local businesses but only lasted a few years. Having already established a reputation for quality photography, Savage decided to try dry plate photography. He was able to operate at an increasing speed and started quickly retaking the photographs that had helped make him famous. Many of the western railroads later used these new photographs to advertise their rail lines. As Salt Lake City expanded, many photographers decided to set up shop around Savage. He helped many of his apprentices start their own businesses. Competition began to grow. To have an edge over other photography studios, the Art Bazar began selling Valentine's Day cards. In April 1892 Savage photographed the completion of the Salt Lake City LDS temple's exterior. The next year on Thanksgiving Day, Savage's first wife, Annie, died from kidney disease. As Savage grew older, he handed the responsibility of the Art Bazar to his sons, Ralph and George. The ease of dry plate photography hurt business as amateur photographers were becoming numerous. The Art Bazar expanded to sell photography equipment to amateur photographers. Around 1906, Savage retired from the Art Bazar, letting the next generation continue his business. At 63 he married a widow, Annie Smith Clowes. Upon Savage's invitation, the Inter-Mountain Photographers Association held their convention at the Art Bazar in 1908. Savage took many trips in his old years and wrote travelogues which were printed in local papers. In January 1909 upon visiting the Art Bazar, he complained to his son George that he was not feeling well. His condition worsened and he died early in the morning, February 3, 1909, of heart failure. Family One of Savage's daughters, Luacine Annette Saveage, married J. Reuben Clark, who would become a member of the LDS Church First Presidency. Legacy Savage was a widely known railroad photographer. His photographs covered fifty years of changes \\"from the early stages of the Old West to the beginnings of the Industrial Age.\\" Upon his death, John P. Meakin wrote that Savage \\"was the loving peasant prince of Utah.\\" Savage's sons, Ralph, Roscoe, and George, continued running the Art Bazar after his death. Ralph Savage was chosen by the LDS Church to photograph the interior of the Salt Lake Temple. His photographs were published in The House of the Lord. The Art Bazar almost burned down again a few years after Savage's death. It was only partially damaged, and the main building remained intact. However, the fire destroyed Savage's negatives from the last 25 years of his life.

Life Qian Chu came to power after his brother, Qian Zong, was deposed in a coup d'√©tat. At the time, Wuyue was at its largest territorial extent, ruling 13 in modern-day Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Fujian. Throughout its history, Wuyue maintained a policy of nominally submitting to the successive dominant northern regimes. Unlike the other small states in the south, the Wuyue kings never declared themselves Emperor. In return, the northern regimes respected Wuyue's autonomy and conferred upon its kings high honours, one of which was the title of \\"Commander of All Horses and Soldiers Under Heaven\\". Indeed, Qian Chu changed his name from the original Qian Hongchu, because the character hong was barred by taboo (as the name of Emperor Taizu of Song's father was Zhao Hongyin ()). When the Song Dynasty unified northern China in the 960s, Qian Chu reportedly followed his ancestor Qian Liu's instruction to submit as soon as possible when the \\"true lord\\" appeared. In 960, Qian Chu submitted to Song, and changed his name in the same year. Subsequently, Qian Chu obeyed orders from the Song court to participate in the annexation of the other small southern kingdoms on behalf of the Song emperor. In 968, he was re-created the King of Wuyue by the Song emperor, and subsequently invested with further imperial honours. In 977, the new emperor Emperor Taizong of Song invested Qian with the nominal titles Chancellor, Chief Secretary, and Commander of All Horses and Soldiers Under Heaven. However, in 978, Qian Chu surrendered his territories to the Song regime, possibly under veiled threat from the Song court. Nevertheless, the \\"voluntary\\" surrender protected the Wuyue region from the ravages of war that visited other contemporary regimes. The region was able to maintain its infrastructure and economic advantage, built up over the Wuyue period, which in no small part contributed to the Yangtze Delta being the economic centre of China up to the present day. To allay northern suspicions and prevent conflict, Qian Chu stayed in the Song capital, Bianjing (now Kaifeng), and moved 3000 members of his household there. Qian nominally remained a king. His sons and a large number of the Wuyue elite were given various imperial posts and titles. Initially, Emperor Taizong of Song raised the prefecture of Yangzhou to the nominal state of Huaihai (), and installed Qian Chu as King of Huaihai (). In 984, Qian Chu was made King of Hannan () (a smaller nominal feoff) instead, and in 987 reduced again to King of Nanyang (), with the right to take up residence in Nanyang, but then immediately additionally created Prince of Xu (), with an enlarged feoff. In 988, Qian Chu lost his title as king and was made Prince of Deng () instead, with a larger nominal feoff and actual income. Qian Chu reportedly enjoyed a good personal relationship with the emperor, being regularly summoned to the palace for banquets and ball games. On his 60th birthday (by the Chinese calendar) in 988, Emperor Taizong of Song sent him wine as a gift. After drinking the wine, he became violently ill and died that night. He was given a state funeral, posthumously raised to King of Qin, and buried near Luoyang.Zhejiang News: The last king of Wuyue's tomb may be in Cangnan Qian Chu had seven sons, one of whom went on to become a Chancellor in the Song court. Other legacy Shrine to the Qian Kings at West Lake, Hangzhou. Qian Chu enjoyed writing poetry. One of his published poems survives to this day. Like the other kings of Wuyue, Qian Chu was a devout Buddhist.

Opened in 1859, it is currently managed by South Western Railway and is on the West of England Main Line, down the line from . History Down Atlantic Coast Express west of Tisbury The Salisbury and Yeovil Railway (S&YR;) opened Tisbury railway station with the first section of its line, from to Gillingham, on 2 May 1859.Body, p.94 At first only passengers were catered for, but goods traffic started on 1 September 1860. The main goods yard and warehouse was on the north side of the line at the west end of the station, but some sidings were also added on the opposite side of the line. Initially the railway had just a single track but a passing loop and two platforms were provided at Tisbury. The whole line was double track by 1870 and a signal box was opened here in 1875. The S&YR; never operated any trains, instead they were provided by the London and South Western Railway, which bought out the S&YR; in 1878. In 1923 this became part of the Southern Railway, which in turn was nationalised in 1948 to become the Southern Region of British Railways. During all this time there were only incremental changes at Tisbury, but this was to change from 1963. In that year the line was transferred to the Western Region, and the Reshaping of British Railways report was published. The smaller stations were soon closed, and most trains only ran as far as , instead of continuing to places such as , Plymouth and Padstow. Goods traffic was stopped from 18 April 1966 and on 5 February 1967 the signal box was closed, despite having only been opened to replace the original on 12 October 1958. The line was reduced to just a single track on 1 April 1967 and the southern platform sold off to the agricultural suppliers next door. The single-track section from Wilton to Gillingham proved to be too long, and so a loop was reinstated mid-way at Tisbury on 24 March 1986. As the second platform had been sold off, the new ¬£435,000 loop was installed to the east of the station. This means that trains have to wait outside the station when passing; the loop is controlled from and is signalled so that trains can run in either direction on each line. Description London to Exeter The single platform is on the north side of the line, the side nearest the village. The old station offices still stand, as does the disused signal box which is at the west end of the platform. The platform is only long enough for three or four coach trains, so when trains comprise two Class 159 units Selective Door Operation is used and only the doors on the front unit are unlocked. Services South Western Railway operate hourly throughout most of the week between , Tisbury, and London Waterloo station. Trains are timetabled to pass in the loop to the east of the station. Due to the short platform, passengers wishing to alight need to be in the front 3 coaches of the train as the platform can only take 3-car trains.

It concludes the Dragon Prince trilogy. Plot summary Part One: Andry, the new Lord of Goddess Keep, has visions of war and death. He sees the destruction of Radzyn, its proud towers ablaze. To prevent his visions, he reworks the teachings and rituals of Goddess Keep based on the findings of the Star Scroll. He also trains Sunrunners in sorcery. Meanwhile, true sorcerers ready themselves to challenge Pol's right to Princemarch. Ruval, Ianthe's oldest, undisputed son, prepared for the challenge by learning sorcery, while Marron infiltrates Chiana of Meadowlord's personal guards. When he gets close enough, he allows Mireva to enter Chiana's chamber and enspell the Princess with a mirror. Chiana then begins to amass an army, which will invade Princemarch. Part Two: Year 728: Pol, now Ruling Prince of Princemarch, seeks to become the man and Prince that his parents, High Prince Rohan and High Princess Sioned raised him to be, but his spirit is impatient and restless. When word comes that dragons are being hunted, Pol follows Riyan and Sorin to Elktrap Manor. They find a dying dragon nearby, who shows them that men had attacked it using sorcery. The attackers were Ruval and Marron, who had been trying to get Pol's attention. A battle ensues. Sorin is killed. As the Desert mourns, Ruval enlists Prince Miyon of Cunaxa's aid in overthrowing Pol. He and Marron hide in Miyon's entourage as the Prince travels to Stronghold on business before the Rialla, while Mireva becomes a servant of Miyon's illegitimate daughter, Meiglan. Miyon plans to use Meiglan to ensnare Pol. Pol has been raised among strong, intelligent, independent women all his life, while Meiglan is an innocent, shy, easily terrified young girl. Miyon has abused Meiglan all her life, and thinks Pol will be smitten by her innocence and need for protection. As Pol prepares for the challenge Ruval will make, he begins to fall for Meiglan despite his suspicions of her. Before Ruval can make his challenge, however, Marron challenges Pol himself for Feruche, their birthplace. Riyan, who had only moments ago had been made Lord of Feruche, accepts Marron's challenge of sorcery. As Marron forms his first spell, Andry turns it back on the sorcerer by using his knowledge of the Star Scroll. He kills Marron in retribution for Sorin's death. This act results in Andry's banishment from the Desert. When Ruval's challenge finally comes, on starlight, Rohan realizes that Pol needs to be told the truth about birth: that Ianthe bore him and he was a diarmadhi. Pol is horrified and angry, but uses his newfound knowledge to study the sorcery in the scrolls. He and Ruval meet at Rivernrock and the rabikor begins. During the battle, Ruval tries to pull a dragon from the sky, but Pol bonds with it. The dragon, Azhdeen, kills Ruval, ending the threat to Pol's claim on Princemarch.

He ruled from 934 until 965, when his state was conquered by the Song Dynasty. He died soon afterwards. Meng ruled largely peacefully for three decades. The Later Shu became one of the centers for the arts and literature, where it flourished with support from the court. An anthology of lyric poetry known as the Amidst the Flowers Anthology was compiled in 940. It was also among the most stable of the southern kingdoms, but it also stagnated militarily and politically. When the Song Dynasty replaced the Later Zhou, the last of the Five Dynasties, in 960, Song's founding emperor Emperor Taizu of Song made it his mission to reunify the realm. Song forces forced Meng Chang to surrender in 965 on the road to the reunification of most of China.  Background  Meng Renzan was born in 919, in Taiyuan.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 49. His father Meng Zhixiang was then an officer under Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin, and had married Li Cunxu's cousin as his wife.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 64. Meng Renzan, however, was not born of her, but rather of a different Lady Li ‚Äî one who had previously been a concubine of Li Cunxu's, but whom Li Cunxu had awarded to Meng Zhixiang as a concubine.History of Song, vol. 479. He was Meng Zhixiang's fifth son but the third to grow up.  During Later Tang  In 923, Li Cunxu declared himself emperor of a new Later Tang, and shortly after destroyed archrival Later Liang and took over its territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. In 925, he further sent an army and destroyed Later Tang's southwestern neighbor Former Shu (whose territory would eventually be the territory for Later Shu). He commissioned Meng Renzan's father Meng Zhixiang as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Former Shu's main territory Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). However, shortly after, the entire Later Tang realm was thrown into confusion due to a series of mutinies,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. and Li Cunxu himself was killed in a mutiny at the capital Luoyang in 926. He was succeeded as Later Tang's emperor by his adoptive brother Li Siyuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Meng Zhixiang, while legally a subject of the new Later Tang emperor, shortly began to develop frictions with Li Siyuan's regime, particularly with Li Siyuan's powerful chief of staff An Chonghui, who suspected both Meng (on account of his marital relations with Li Cunxu's cousin) and Meng's neighboring military governor, Dong Zhang of the Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), and tensions began to escalate, particularly after Meng executed an official that Li Siyuan sent to be the monitor of the Xichuan army, Li Yan (ÊùéÂö¥), in 927. At that time, Meng had sent messengers to escort his wife (who had been created the Grand Princess Qionghua), Meng Renzan's mother Lady Li, and Meng Renzan to Xichuan. When they reached Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), the news of Meng's execution of Li Yan reached Fengxiang. Fengxiang's military governor Li Congyan thus detained them at Fengxiang for some time, but Li Siyuan subsequently ordered that they be allowed to continue to proceed to Xichuan. (An older brother of his, whose name was lost to history and who was born of the Grand Princess, however, was not apparently not allowed to proceed to Xichuan.) After reaching Xichuan, Meng Renzan, considered to be intelligent in his young age, was given the title of military commander (Ë°åËªçÂè∏È¶¨, Xingjun Sima) of the Xichuan army.  During Meng Zhixiang's reign as emperor of Later Shu  Meng Zhixiang later consolidated his control over the region, taking control of Dongchuan and nearby smaller circuits as well, and also carried the Later Tang-bestowed title of Prince of Shu. In 934, shortly after Li Siyuan's death, Meng Zhixiang declared himself emperor of a new state of Shu (historically known as Later Shu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. He bestowed on Meng Renzan the titles of acting Taibao (Â§™‰øù), military governor of Dongchuan, director of Chongsheng Palace (Â¥áËÅñÂÆÆ), and honorary chancellor (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi). Meng Zhixiang, however, had been suffering from a stroke for years, and by fall 934, he was extremely ill. He created Meng Renzan Crown Prince and regent. After entrusting Meng Renzan to the chancellor Zhao Jiliang, the generals Li Renhan and Zhao Tingyin, the chief of staff Wang Chuhui, and the commanders of the imperial guards Zhang Gongduo and Hou Hongshi (‰æØÂºòÂØ¶), he died that same night. Three days later, Meng Renzan took the throne and, pursuant to the will Meng Zhixiang left, changed his name to Meng Chang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. He was 15 at that time.  Reign  Early reign = Immediately after Meng Chang's assumption of the throne, Li Renhan insisted on being put in command of the imperial guards. Meng Chang initially reluctantly agreed and put him in command, making Zhao Tingyin his deputy. However, Zhang Gongduo and several of Meng Chang's close associates thereafter accused Li Renhan of plotting treason. After consulting with Zhao Jiliang and Zhao Tingyin, Meng decided to arrest him while he was attending an imperial meeting, and then put him to death, along with his son Li Jihong (ÊùéÁπºÂÆè) and several associates. Shocked by the development, the senior general Li Zhao (ÊùéËÇá), who had previously refused to bow to the young emperor, changed his attitude and became very submissive. Meng's associates advocated putting Li Zhao to death, too, but Meng did not do so, instead forcing Li Zhao into retirement. In 935, Meng honored his mother Consort Li empress dowager. Meanwhile, the new Later Tang emperor Li Congke launched an army and tried to recover Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), which had surrendered to Later Shu in the last days of Meng Zhixiang's reign. The attack, however, was repelled by the Later Shu general Li Yanhou (ÊùéÂª∂Âéö). In 936, Li Congke was overthrown by his brother-in-law Shi Jingtang, ending Later Tang. Shi established his own Later Jin,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. and, in 937, sent emissaries to Later Shu to notify Meng of this. Meng wrote back, using protocols fitting for coequal states.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. In 939, the non-Han chieftain Peng Shichou (ÂΩ≠Â£´ÊÑÅ), who was formally a Later Shu vassal (as the prefect of Xi Prefecture (Ê∫™Â∑û, in modern Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan), attacked two prefectures belonging to Later Shu's southeastern neighbor Chu (which was formally a Later Jin vassal) ‚Äî Chen (Ëæ∞Â∑û, in modern Huaihua, Hunan) and Li (ÊæßÂ∑û, in modern Changde, Hunan) ‚Äî and sought aid from the Later Shu imperial government to further advance. Meng refused, finding that the campaign was too far away from Later Shu proper. Forces sent by Chu's prince Ma Xifan subsequently defeated Peng, who surrendered to Chu. His territory became Chu territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Ever since Later Shu's founding, major generals had been frequently given military governorships but would remain at the capital Chengdu to continue to oversee imperial army operations. This led to their neglect of the governance of the circuits as they left the governance to staff members, who were often corrupt and unresponsive to the concerns of the people. Meng became aware of this and, in 941, he reformed the situation by stripping Zhao Tingyin, Wang, and Zhang of their military governorships while giving them other honorary titles. He subsequently sent five civilian officials to five circuits to serve as their acting military governors. Also in 941, when Later Jin's military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei), An Congjin, was plotting to rebel against Shi, he sent emissaries to Meng seeking aid, requesting that Later Shu attack Later Jin's Jin (ÈáëÂ∑û, in modern Ankang, Shaanxi) and Shang (ÂïÜÂ∑û, in modern Shangluo, Shaanxi) Prefectures to distract Later Jin's forces. After discussing with his officials, Meng concluded that sending a small army would not substantially aid An, and sending a large army would create great logistical problems. He thus declined to aid An. (An was subsequently defeated by the general Gao Xingzhou, and committed suicide.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. In 943, Meng issued an edict for general selections of females ranging from age 12 to 19, to fill his palace with concubines. This greatly disturbed the people, and there were many households that quickly married off their daughters to avoid having the daughters selected. When the county magistrate Chen Jizhi (Èô≥Âèä‰πã) submitted a petition urging the cancellation of the edict, Meng rewarded Chen for his honesty, but did not end the selection process. The women who were selected were sorted into 14 ranks of concubines. In 944, for reasons not stated in history, Meng reversed his earlier reform with having actual acting military governors at the circuits, and again had major generals and chancellors assume military governorships remotely. Later in 944, the Later Jin officer Wang Junhuai (ÁéãÂêõÊá∑) defected to Later Shu and volunteered to guide a Later Shu army to capture Later Jin's Jie (ÈöéÂ∑û) and Cheng (ÊàêÂ∑û, both in modern Longnan, Gansu) Prefectures. A subsequent Later Shu army incursion, however, was repelled by an army launched from Later Jin's Qin Prefecture (Áß¶Â∑û, in modern Tianshui, Gansu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. = Middle reign = Around the new year 947, with a major Khitan Liao Dynasty invasion force commanded by its Emperor Taizong approaching the Later Jin capital Kaifeng, the Later Jin emperor Shi Chonggui (Shi Jingtang's nephew and successor) surrendered to Liao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Most Later Jin regional governors quickly submitted petitions to submit to the Liao emperor, as he claimed to be the legitimate emperor over the Han and the Khitan alike. However, one of them, He Chongjian (‰ΩïÈáçÂª∫) the military governor of Xiongwu Circuit (ÈõÑÊ≠¶, headquartered at Qin Prefecture) refused to submit to Liao, and, after executing a Liao emissary to his circuit, surrendered his circuit (including Qin, Jie, and Cheng Prefectures) to Later Shu. Subsequently, as He Chongjian advocated, Later Shu forces also attacked Feng Prefecture (È≥≥Â∑û, in modern Baoji), and Feng's defender Shi Fengjun (Áü≥Â•âÈ†µ) ‚Äî a member of Later Jin's imperial clan ‚Äî also surrendered that prefecture to Later Shu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Due to the Liao emperor's misrule of the former Later Jin territory, however, many Han rebellions rose against him, with the strongest being led by the Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan, who claimed imperial title as emperor of a new Later Han. He soon had control over most of the former Later Jin territory ‚Äî as Emperor Taizong withdrew and later died. However, the Liao-commissioned military governor of Jinchang Circuit (ÊôâÊòå, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), Zhao Kuangzan (Ë∂ôÂå°Ë¥ä) ‚Äî a son of the major Liao general Zhao Yanshou ‚Äî feared that the Later Han emperor would not tolerate him, and therefore instead sent emissaries submitting his circuit to Later Shu. At Zhao's request, Meng Chang launched a large army and put it under the command of the former Later Jin general Zhang Qianzhao (ÂºµËôîÊò≠), who had submitted to Later Shu, to aid Zhao. He also had Wang Chuhui write Hou Yi (‰æØÁõä) the Later Han military governor of Fengxiang, persuading Hou to submit to Later Shu as well. Hou agreed, and the Later Shu army approaching Jinchang's capital Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ) appeared to be ready to add large amounts of territory to Later Shu. However, Zhao's staff member Li Shu (ÊùéÊÅï) persuaded Zhao to change his mind and submit to Later Han instead; he sent Li to Later Han's capital Kaifeng to beg Liu's forgiveness. Hearing Zhao's change of mind, Hou also sent messengers to Liu, begging forgiveness as well. Liu sent the general Wang Jingchong toward Jinchang and Fengxiang to prepare to combat the Later Shu troops, with instructions to attack Zhao and Hou if they again change their mind. Zhao, however, left for Kaifeng quickly, and Hou, after some hesitation, also did so, allowing Wang's army to take over control of their circuits. (Wang considered killing Hou when Hou hesitated, but as Liu Zhiyuan had just died around that time, and Wang was concerned that his son and successor Liu Chengyou was unaware of the deceased emperor's instructions. Hou, hearing news of this, quickly left for Kaifeng.) Wang subsequently defeated the Later Shu army in relatively minor engagements, leading to the Later Shu army's withdrawal, ending Later Shu's hopes of large territorial gains for the moment.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. However, soon came another potential chance for territory gains. Hou, upon arrival at Kaifeng, gave many gifts to the key officials that Liu Zhiyuan instructed to assist the new young emperor Liu Chengyou, and was able to gain substantial influence at the Later Han court, including being made the mayor of the capital. Resentful that Wang considered killing him, he spread rumors to damage Wang's reputation. Upon hearing this, Wang became apprehensive. Further, at that time, two rebellions had risen against Later Han ‚Äî with the major general Li Shouzhen rebelling at Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) and the officer Zhao Siwan rebelling at Jingzhao. Wang thus decided to rebel as well, allying himself with Li and Zhao Siwan, while at the same time also sending emissaries to submit to Later Shu. Zhao Siwan also did so. Later Shu launched troops to try to aid Wang and Zhao Siwan, but the Later Shu army was initially repelled by the Later Han general Zhao Hui (Ë∂ôÊöâ). Meng then launched a larger army under the command of An Siqian (ÂÆâÊÄùË¨ô) the military governor of Shannan West to try to aid Wang and Zhao Siwan, despite the urging by the chancellor Wu Zhaoyi that doing so was risky. An's army, however, was bogged down at the front with Later Han and, when it ran out of food, was forced to withdraw. With hopes of Later Shu aid gone and Zhao Hui sieging his capital Fengxiang Municipality, Wang committed suicide. Zhao Siwan surrendered to the Later Han forces, but when he did not quickly leave for Kaifeng, the Later Han general Guo Congyi (ÈÉ≠ÂæûÁæ©) arrested and killed him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. While the Later Shu army was combating Later Han forces, there was also a major shakeup within the Later Shu imperial government. The chancellor Zhang Ye was arrogant and wasteful, and he had seized many people's properties, drawing resentment. He was also protecting fugitives and putting people who owed him money in jail. The imperial guard commander Sun Hanshao (Â≠´Êº¢Èü∂), who had previous conflicts with Zhang, thus submitted an accusation to Meng that Zhang and his son Zhang Jizhao (ÂºµÁπºÊò≠) were plotting treason. Believing in Sun's accusations, Meng arrested and put Zhang Ye and Zhang Jizhao to death. Meanwhile, An also laid similar accusations against Wang Chuhui and Zhao Tingyin. However, Meng did not wish to kill either of them, and allowed them to retire. Believing that much had been hidden from him while Zhang Ye and Wang Chuhui were in control of the government, Meng set up chests in front of the palace, allowing the people to make secret reports to him by putting them in the chests. Li Hao and Xu Guangpu replaced Zhang as chancellor (although Xu was shortly after removed after being accused of having sexually harassed the daughter of Former Shu's founding emperor Wang Jian), while no one immediately succeeded Wang Chuhui as chief of staff ‚Äî Meng had wanted to make two close associates, Gao Yanzhao and Wang Zhaoyuan his chiefs of staff, but as they were perceived to lack sufficient seniority, gave them lesser offices and made them acting chiefs of staff, while giving them free rein in the matters of finance. Wang Zhaoyuan, in particular, was allowed to take from the treasury at will, with no accounting of what he took. In 950, Meng created his brothers and sons imperial princes.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. In 951, at Gao's insistence, he was removed from the post of acting chief of staff. Meng put his cousin (the son of Meng Zhixiang's sister the Princess of Bao), Yi Shenzheng, acting chief of staff to replace Gao. It was said that he entrusted much of the affairs of state to Yi, and while Yi was ambitious and hardworking, he was also greedy and wasteful. With Yi and Wang Zhaoyuan in charge of much of the governance, it was said that Meng's governance of Later Shu began to decline from that point.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290. In 952, a major flood occurred at the Later Shu capital Chengdu, such that more than 5,000 people drowned and more than 1,000 homes were destroyed. Even four of the halls at the imperial temple were damaged. Meng issued a general pardon and authorized stipends for the victims of the flood. Later in 952, there was a disturbance at Wude Circuit (i.e., Dongchuan). The acting military governor of Wude, Shao Yanjun (ÈÇµÂª∂Èàû) had been disrespectful to the monitor of the Wude army, Wang Chengpi (ÁéãÊâø‰∏ï), such that Wang became very resentful of him. He took the officer Sun Qin (Â≠´Ê¨Ω) ‚Äî who was not aware of his plot ‚Äî to see Shao. At the meeting, Wang killed Shao and then ordered his family be slaughtered, claiming to Sun that he had been given a secret imperial edict to execute Shao. Sun initially believed him, but when Sun then insisted on seeing the edict, Wang stated, \\"I can make you powerful. Do not question me too much.\\" Sun, by this time aware that there was no such edict, fled, and mobilized the army. They attacked and captured Wang. He then executed Wang and delivered Wang's head to Chengdu. In 953, at Wu Zhaoyi's advocacy (including Wu's spending of personal wealth to build schools), Meng agreed to authorize printings of the Four Books and Five Classics, to promote learning ‚Äî as the study of these Confucian classics had been neglected since the fall of Tang Dynasty. It was said that after this, literature was again valued in the Shu realms.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 291. Meanwhile, the people of the Later Shu realm had been much resentful of An Siqian's involvement in Zhang Ye's death and in the removal of Zhao Tingyin. An was also blamed for the failures of the Later Shu army in aiding Wang Jingchong. By 954, when An was commanding the imperial guards, the security measures at the Later Shu palace itself had been strengthened, and An came to believe that Meng was doing so because Meng suspected him. Further, he was harsh with the imperial guard soldiers, often putting soldiers to death. Indeed, at times when he dismissed soldiers from imperial guard service due to his dissatisfactions with them, but Meng overruled him and kept the soldiers on the imperial guard rolls, he would find ways to have those soldiers killed. Believing the accusations by the official Wang Zao (ÁéãËóª) that An was plotting treason, Meng had An and his three sons arrested and executed. He also removed Sun Hanshao from his imperial guard command, apparently concerned about Sun as well. The imperial guard command was divided between 10 generals. = Late reign = In 955, Meng Chang became aware that the emperor of Later Zhou ‚Äî the successor state to Later Han's main territory ‚Äî Guo Rong, was planning an invasion to recover Feng, Qin, Cheng, and Jie Prefectures. He was planning on sending his attendant Zhao Jizha (Ë∂ôÂ≠£Êú≠) to those prefectures to review their preparedness for the impending Later Zhou invasion. Before departing Chengdu, Zhao, who was ambitious and considered himself to have both administrative and military abilities, stated to Meng his belief that neither Han Jixun (ÈüìÁπºÂã≥) the military governor of Xiongwu Circuit nor Wang Wandi (ÁéãËê¨Ëø™) the prefect of Feng Prefecture had the abilities to lead large armies to defend against the Later Zhou attack. Rather, he recommended himself to do so. Meng thus made Zhao the monitor of the Xiongwu army and gave him 1,000 elite soldiers to accompany him to Xiongwu to prepare the defense. Meng also ordered Wang Zhaoyuan to review the troop situation on the northern border with Later Zhou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 292. Shortly after, Later Zhou launched its attack, with its armies commanded by the generals Wang Jing (ÁéãÊôØ) the military governor of Fengxiang and Xiang Xun (ÂêëË®ì). On the way to the front, Zhao, hearing of the actual launching of the Later Zhou attack, panicked, and fled back to Chengdu by himself, causing a general panic in the city as well, as the populace to believe that the Later Shu army had already suffered a major defeat. When Meng met him to inquire him as to what was happening on the front, he was unable to answer. In anger, Meng put him to death. Meng sent the generals Li Tinggui (ÊùéÂª∑Áè™) and Gao Yanchou (È´òÂΩ•ÂÑî) to the front to combat the Later Zhou army. He also sent emissaries to other rival states of Later Zhou's ‚Äî Northern Han (which claimed legitimate succession from Later Han) to the north, and Southern Tang to the east ‚Äî to try to form alliances. Both Northern Han's emperor Liu Jun and Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing agreed to the alliance, but did not appear to actually carry out actions to help counter the Later Zhou attack on Later Shu. Meanwhile, the Later Shu forces were initially able to repel the Later Zhou attack, but eventually, after a battle in which the Later Shu general Wang Luan (ÁéãÂ∑í) was captured by Wang Jing, the Later Shu army went into a panic, forcing Li and Gao to retreat. Han then abandoned Qin Prefecture and fled back to Chengdu; his assistant Zhao Pin (Ë∂ôÁé≠) surrendered the city. Subsequently, Cheng and Jie also surrendered to Later Zhou. Wang Jing subsequently captured Feng Prefecture as well after a siege. In fear, Meng wrote Guo, requesting peace between the two states; on the letter, he referred to himself as \\"Emperor of the Great Shu.\\" Displeased that Meng would dare to consider himself an equal, Guo refused to respond. In fear that Guo would launch a further attack deeper into Later Shu territory, Meng mobilized large armies and stationed them at Jianmen Pass and Baidi. As the armies' expenses were causing a drain on the imperial treasury, he minted money with iron and began to collect iron items as tax payments, causing distress among the people. (However, with Guo shortly after launching a major attack on Southern Tang, he did not continue his attack on Later Shu at this point.) In 956, Meng, while maintaining the division of the imperial guards between 10 generals, put Li Tinggui in overall command of the imperial guards. Meanwhile, though, the popular opinion was that Li, as a general who had lost the campaign against Later Zhou, should not be in command. Li thus offered his resignation. In 957, Meng allowed him to retire from military duties. Empress Dowager Li, concerned that over the years, the military commands had not been in the hands of right generals, spoke to Meng:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 293. Meng did not listen to her, however. Meanwhile, also in 957, apparently as a posture of goodwill, Guo sent several thousand Later Shu soldiers that he captured during the Qin/Feng campaign, whom he had previously made into a special Huai'en Army (Êá∑ÊÅ©Ëªç) and put under command of the captured Later Shu officer Xiao Zhiyuan (Ëï≠Áü•ÈÅ†), back to Later Shu. To reciprocate, Meng also some 80 Later Zhou officers captured in the campaign back to Later Zhou, and against wrote Guo, asking for friendly relations. However, Guo was again displeased with the letter's expression of equal status, and therefore again refused to respond. When Meng heard of this, he angrily stated, \\"When we became emperor and were offering sacrifices to heaven and earth, you were still a bandit. How dare you do this to us?\\" In 958, there was a time when the low level advisory official Zhang Jiuling (Á´†‰πùÈΩ°) had the chance to meet Meng. He stated to Meng that the reason why the imperial governance was ineffective was because the government was controlled by wicked people. When Meng asked him who the wicked people were, he referred to Li Hao and Wang. Meng, in anger, stated that Zhang was falsely accusing senior officials, and had Zhang exiled to be a secretary to the prefect of Wei Prefecture (Á∂≠Â∑û, in modern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 294. Meanwhile, Gao Baorong, the ruler of Jingnan, who carried the title of Prince of Nanping as a vassal of Later Zhou, wrote Meng repeatedly, urging him to submit as a vassal to Later Zhou. With his campaign against Southern Tang over (concluding with Southern Tang's submission as a vassal and ceding of its territory north of the Yangtze River to Later Zhou), Guo was also making preparations for another campaign against Later Shu. Meng was concerned sufficiently that he submitted the matter to discussions by his senior officials. All of the senior generals argued that the Shu lands had natural defenses and swore that they were willing to die to defend the state. Meng thus had Li Hao write Gao back, rejecting the overture. Gao subsequently offered his services to Guo in attacking Later Shu. In preparation against the coming Later Zhou invasion, Meng had the generals Zhao Chongtao, his elder brother Meng Yiye (Â≠üË≤ΩÊ•≠), Zhao Sijin (Ë∂ôÊÄùÈÄ≤), and Gao Yanchou take up defensive positions various passes into Shu lands. The invasion never came, though, as Guo fell ill and died in summer 959. Nevertheless, the Later Shu people were frightened about the prospects of the invasion. The junior official Xu Jifu (ÂæêÂèäÁî´), who was upset at his lack of promotions within the Later Shu government, thereafter tried to use this opportunity to plot a coup ‚Äî planning to support Wang Jian's grandson Wang Lingyi (Áéã‰ª§ÂÑÄ) as the coup leader. When it became clear that Later Zhou was not invading, however, the plot was leaked by its members. Xu committed suicide, and Meng ordered Wang to commit suicide. In the aftermaths of Guo's death, the Later Zhou general Zhao Kuangyin seized power in a coup, establishing Song Dynasty as its Emperor Taizu.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 1. In 962, Meng created his son Meng Xuanzhe crown prince.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2. Later in 962, Meng ordered a closer review of the tax rolls for the prefectures under Later Shu control, hoping to collect more revenues by stricter enforcement of the tax code. The county magistrate Si Chun (ÂõõÊ∑≥) submitted a petition, arguing that stricter enforcement would merely put greater stress on the people and would damage the state, but Meng did not listen to him. = The fall of Later Shu = In 964, the Song emperor was planning to launch a major campaign to destroy Northern Han. However, after consulting with the general Zhang Hui (ÂºµÊöâ), Zhang advocated against such a move, believing that Song's Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), on the border with Northern Han, had been so damaged by warfare that it would not serve as a good springboard for an invasion against Northern Han at that time. He thus made Zhang the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Feng Prefecture with orders for him to survey the geography of the region, to prepare an eventual invasion of Later Shu. Li Hao, suspecting that a Song invasion was soon coming and concerned that it would be difficult to stand against such an invasion, now advocated for Later Shu to submit to Song as a vassal. Wang Zhaoyuan strongly opposed, however, and so Meng Chang reacted by again ramping up defenses to prepare for invasion.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 3. In 964, at Wang's suggestion, Meng wrote secret letters hidden in wax pills and tried to have three covert messengers deliver them to Liu Jun, suggesting simultaneous preemptive strikes on Song. However, once in Song territory, one of the messengers defected to Song and offered the contents of the letter he possessed to the Song emperor. The Song emperor happily stated, \\"I now have a justification for a campaign!\\" He pardoned the other two messengers as well, and had all three of them map out the Later Shu geography as well as locations of key garrisons, in preparation for the coming campaign. Shortly after, he launched 60,000 men to attack on two fronts, through Feng Prefecture on the north side of Later Shu (commanded by the general Wang Quanbin (ÁéãÂÖ®Êñå)), and from Gui Prefecture (Ê≠∏Â∑û, in modern Yichang, Hubei, formerly part of Jingnan's territory, which Song took directly under control in 963), on the east side of Later Shu, commanded by the general Liu Guangyi (ÂäâÂÖâÁæ©). Hearing of the coming Song invasion, Meng commissioned Wang Zhaoyuan to command the overall campaign of resistance. At the feast to send Wang off, Wang, who greatly inflated his own abilities, compared himself to the great Shu Han chancellor Zhuge Liang, and boasted that he would not only be able to resist the Song invasion but be able to conquer the Central Plains (i.e., Song proper). Assisting Wang on the campaign were Zhao Chongtao, Han Baozhen, and Li Jin (ÊùéÈÄ≤). Han and Li were quickly captured by the Song officer Li Yande (ÂêèÂª∂Âæ∑), and after that, the Later Shu forces under Wang lost battle after battle. Fearful that the Song forces would soon be descending on Chengdu, Meng dispatched another army with Meng Xuanzhe in titular command but with Li Tinggui and Zhang Hui'an (ÂºµÊÉ†ÂÆâ) in actual command, to set up defense position at Jianmen Pass. Before Meng Xuanzhe's army could reach Jianmen, however, Wang Quanbin's army bypassed Jianmen and to try to cut off Wang Zhaoyuan's path back to Chengdu. Wang Zhaoyuan tried to engage Wang Quanbin, but his army was defeated, and both he and Zhao were captured. Meng Xuanzhe took his army and fled back to Chengdu. Hearing of Wang Zhaoyuan's and Zhao's capture, Meng Chang was panicking and initially could not decide what to do. He consulted the remaining senior officers. Shi Fengjun advocated defending Chengdu, believing that the Song army could not persist in a siege. Meng, however, rejected that idea, stating: At Li Hao's suggestion, he sealed the imperial treasury and begged the Song army to allow him to surrender, sending Yi Shenzheng to the front to submit his surrender petition. When Yi reached Wang Quanbin's army, Wang Quanbin accepted the petition, and sent the officer Kang Yanze (Â∫∑Âª∂Êæ§) to Chengdu to ensure Meng of his safety. When Wang Quanbin reached Chengdu, Meng surrendered to him, ending Later Shu.  After surrender to Song Dynasty  At the time he surrendered, Meng Chang also sent his brother Meng Renzhi (Â≠ü‰ªÅË¥Ñ) to the Song capital Kaifeng to express his humility and fear, including the language, \\"I considered myself to have too many sins, and therefore I fear and worry.\\" The Song emperor responded in an edict to try to comfort him, \\"As you now seek better fortune, your prior offenses are forgiven. We will not go back on our own words. You should not worry.\\" The edict did not refer to Meng Chang by name, to show a degree of respect to him, and also referred to Empress Dowager Li as \\"the Mother of the State\\" to also show similar respect to her. In spring 965, Meng Chang and his family, as well as high level officials, began the trek to Kaifeng, down the Yangtze River to the east. Once they reached Jiangling, they were given special horses and wagons. When they reached Kaifeng, the Song emperor welcomed them in a grand ceremony and again reassured them that they were forgiven. He created Meng the Duke of Qin, and gave him the additional honorary titles of Kaifu Yitong Sansi (ÈñãÂ∫úÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏), acting Taishi (Â§™Â∏´), and Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§). However, Meng died a few days later. The Song emperor mourned him and bestowed the posthumous titles of Shangshu Ling (Â∞öÊõ∏‰ª§) and Prince of Chu on him. Upon Meng Chang's death, Empress Dowager Li did not weep, but stopped eating. She died after a few days as well.

In contrast to polling access methods, there is no pre-defined \\"master\\" node. The most well-known examples are token ring and ARCNET, but there were a range of others, including FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface), which was popular in the early to mid 1990s. Token passing schemes degrade deterministically under load, which is a key reason why they were popular for industrial control LANs such as MAP, (Manufacturing Automation Protocol). The advantage over contention based channel access (such as the CSMA/CD of early Ethernet), is that collisions are eliminated, and that the channel bandwidth can be fully utilized without idle time when demand is heavy. The disadvantage is that even when demand is light, a station wishing to transmit must wait for the token, increasing latency. Some types of token passing schemes do not need to explicitly send a token between systems because the process of \\"passing the token\\" is implicit. An example is the channel access method used during \\"Contention Free Time Slots\\" in the ITU-T G.hn standard for high-speed local area networking using existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cable).

The second novel in the Dragon Prince trilogy, it begins fourteen years after the events in Dragon Prince. Plot summary While on the island of Dorval, the Sunrunner Meath uncovers ancient scrolls in the ruins of an ancient Sunrunner keep. Concerned about the content and odd star symbols, Meath decides to these \\"Star Scrolls\\" to the leader of the Sunrunners, Andrade. Lady Andrade appoints Andry, nephew of High Prince Rohan, to translate the scrolls with the help of Hollis, his brother Maarken's unofficial betrothed. As Andry and Hollis work through the translation and the embedded code, they learn that the scrolls deal with ancient sorcerers and sorcery. They are unaware that the scrolls' existence and rediscovery is known to sorcerers in hiding. Mireva, a sorceress, forms a plan to retrieve the scrolls. One of her charges, Segev, Ianthe's youngest son, travels to Goddess Keep to pose as a young faradhi in order to steal the scrolls. He addicts Hollis to dranath as a cohort, but Andry disrupts Segev's plan. Meanwhile, an arrogant upstart called Masul attempts to proclaim himself Roelstra's son and heir. The whispers of this heir lead to an assassination attempt on Pol's life. To proclaim Pol's position as Prince of Princemarch, Rohan and Pol travel through Princemarch. Pol meets the local Lords and earns his people's favor by participating in their traditions. Unfortunately, another assassination attempt is made, this time ending in the death of Maeta, one of Rohan's most favored guards. At the Rialla, most of the discussion is over Masul, whether or not he is Roelstra's heir, and whether or not it even matters. As the Princes debate the issue, Segev continues to drug Hollis, who in turn draws away from Maarken. Then, Andrade claims that she can show the events of the past by using sorcery from the scrolls. Gleeful at the turn of events, Segev uses sorcery during her conjuring in order to kill her. Andry becomes Lord of Goddess Keep. Though saddened by Andrade's death, the debate of Masul continues; her conjure proved nothing. At last a duel is proposed between Masul and Pol. Maarken, first cousin to Pol, fights in Pol's place as Pol has yet to be knighted. During the battle, Segev uses sorcery against Maarken. Seeing Maarken in pain snaps Hollis out of her drugged state, and she kills Segev. Masul nearly kills Maarken, but at the last minute, Rohan intervenes and kills him with a pair of thrown daggers. As the Desert entourage travels home, accompanied by Hollis, who is slowly recovering, a valley filled with dragons is discovered. The site will become Pol's palace, Dragon's Rest. Sioned, who had earlier 'bumped' into a dragon on sunlight, attempts to 'speak' with a dragon. This time she succeeds and a bond is formed between human and dragon.

Cruising can be an expression of the freedom of possessing a driver's license. Cruising is distinguished from regular driving by the social and recreational nature of the activity, which is characterized by an impulsively random, often aimless course. A popular route (or \\"strip\\") is often the focus of cruising. \\"Cruise nights\\" are evenings during which cars drive slowly. A cruise can be a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.  United States History= There is no clear-cut date when casual driving turned into cruising along a specific route, although it generally began in the years after World War II with youths of Mexican heritage driving lowriders in Southern California towns, and it rapidly became a popular teenage activity. Cruising culture was an evolution of old traditions of strolling down Main Street or around the town square. Although cruising was predominantly boys showing off their cars (ostensibly to meet girls), groups of girls joined in cruising as well. One appeal of cruising was that youths could evade the supervision of parents and family. Driving slowly down long, straight streets, preferably with many traffic lights to increase opportunities to talk to other cruisers or pedestrians, was only one part of cruising. Cruisers would also gather in parking lots, particularly those of drive-ins. As a Tucson journalist noted, \\"Cruisers, like moths and June bugs, eventually congregate around brightly lighted areas.\\" Cruisers were also apt to arrange impromptu races with other cruisers. As early as the 1960s, some towns established ordinances to prohibit driving through parking lots without stopping and the police issued tickets for loitering and curfew violations. Increasingly, cruisers would travel from wider areas to gather on popular strips, with police viewing these visitors as troublemakers. Reports of clashes between groups of cruisers began to appear in local newspapers. However, cruising continued to remain popular, with wildly painted vans and pickup trucks joining hot rods and muscle cars in the 1970s. In many locales, there was a generally positive relationship with law enforcement. Racing in populated areas was discouraged by police surveillance and traffic, but cruisers engaged in other games such as mooning onlookers, laying rubber when a signal turned green, and \\"chinese fire drills\\" in which all occupants of a car stopped at a light would get out, run around the car, and jump back in. There was some decline in cruising in the 1970s, possibly connected to the rise of gas prices but also due to a growing change in community attitudes toward cruising. The San Francisco Bay Area had a \\"cruising summit\\" in 1977 for area police to discuss \\"our mutual problems with cruising\\". The gathering numbers of vehicles and increases in tensions and violence led many communities to begin looking for ways to discourage cruising, despite many adults retaining a permissive acceptance of cruising with nostalgia for their own cruising days. Although business merchants and shoppers had been inconvenienced for years by cruisers, tolerance had dissipated and law enforcement was encouraged to step in. During the summer of 1974, Los Angeles police began cracking down on cruising, first by banning parking along Van Nuys Boulevard and then in August making it a one-way street. The following summer, as many as 15,000 youths from as far away as San Diego converged on Van Nuys, encouraged by local disc jockeys. A similar crackdown on Whittier Boulevard led to the formation of a cruiser's rights group. Police barricaded portions of Whittier in an attempt to disrupt cruising, but even local adults objected to this practice. Other measures were tried, such as shutting portions of Whittier down completely at night. Cruisers moved to Highland Avenue, resulting in the arrest of 170 during the second weekend of September 1979. The following summer, a section of Van Nuys was closed after 9 p.m. The rationale for the blockade was that it only required fifteen police to close the road, but they would need at least 150 officers to police the 15,000 cruisers who had gathered there. As quickly as one strip became unusable, cruisers would find new sites. It became a persistent battle between authorities and cruisers. In 1982, the California state legislature passed a law that gave cities express sanction to shut down streets being used for cruising, when driving \\"for purposes of socializing and assembling interferes with the conduct of businesses, wastes precious energy resources, impedes the progress of general traffic and emergency vehicles, and promotes the generation of local concentrations of air pollution and undesirable noise levels\\". Efforts to stop cruising continued, with increasing blockades and mass arrests. In 1985, random checkpoints began to appear, with police stopping cars passing the spot more than once in a given timeframe. Computers were added in 1988 to help track the cars. New curfews for minors were established. Cruising in southern California was generally suppressed by 1990. Other regions used tactics similar to southern California's, with similar mixed results. Police in Galveston, Texas began arresting cruisers, but had to back down in the face of parental complaints. Joplin, Missouri attempted a ban on cruising, but had to repeal it. Merchants in Portland, Oregon complained that they were losing business because of the crackdowns. Multiple towns across the U.S. adopted the checkpoint system. Other towns tried creative alternatives, such as Laurel, Mississippi and Princeton, West Virginia, which both channeled cruisers onto routes that would not interfere with local businesses. Setting aside parking lots specifically for cruisers was tried in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Indiana. The town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia chose to embrace cruising, awarding prizes for the best customized vehicles. Cities continue to struggle with the problems of cruising into the 2000s. In 2006, Milwaukee, Wisconsin even explored letting police confiscate cruisers' cars. While communities try to prevent impromptu cruising, multiple towns have embraced organized cruising revivals. The Woodward Dream Cruise occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs. The event is a tribute to the classic Woodward cruisers and attracts approximately 1 million people and 40,000 muscle cars, street rods, and custom, collector, and special interest vehicles. Waukegan, Illinois, has an annual summer cruising festival called \\"Scoopin' Genesee\\". Renton, Washington hosts \\"Cruz the Loop\\" each summer, and Modesto, California celebrates \\"Graffiti Summer\\" with an annual cruise parade. =Well-known strips= One of the oldest cruising strips in East Los Angeles is located on Whittier Boulevard. Cruising on this strip became a popular pastime among lowriders during the 1940s before spreading to surrounding neighborhoods in the 1950s. Van Nuys Boulevard in the central San Fernando Valley has been a popular cruising strip since the 1950s; the 1979 film Van Nuys Blvd. depicted the cruising culture on the strip. In the late 1970s, the Wednesday night cruise on Van Nuys attracted up to 40,000 cars. Sunset Boulevard was another popular cruise strip. Perhaps the most famous cruising strip (or main drag), however, is McHenry Avenue in Modesto, California. The cruising culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s was depicted in the film American Graffiti. The film was set (but not actually filmed) in director George Lucas's home town of Modesto, which also hosts an annual \\"Graffiti Summer\\" celebration in the film's honor. Cruising in Detroit was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's northern suburbs along M-1 (Woodward Avenue), from Ferndale north to Pontiac. Cruising along Woodward reached its peak in the mid-1960s, with muscle car competitions that were covered by journalists from Car and Driver, Motor Trend, and CBS World News Roundup. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include US 24 (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side.  United Kingdom Description= There are two main types of cruise: regular cruises, also known as meets, and one-off cruises. The events that take place are similar; cars meet in car parks, park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise - often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire others' cars. If there is enough space there are often drag races, burnouts, and doughnuts. =Meets= A meet is a regular gathering, usually weekly or monthly, where the time and place is freely publicised and well known. It is becoming more common these days for these events to be referred to incorrectly as cruises. =One-off cruises= A one- off cruise is an event organised by a particular group of people or club which would usually be advertised through cruise websites. The final destination of the cruise is often kept secret; it is known only to the convoy leaders in an attempt to keep the cruise unknown to the police. until there are a large enough numbers of people at the cruise to make it difficult to disperse. One- off cruises tend to be larger than meets, but larger meets may have magazine attendance. This type of cruise is increasing in recent times due to increased police interest in regular, established cruises. Some large cruises operate a \\"convoy-only\\" policy. =Locations= Cruises are generally held in retail parks due to the large open car parks needed to accommodate high attendance numbers (sometimes more than 500 cars). Naturally, with many cruises situated in retail parks, most cruise locations are also in close proximity to fast food restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King. = Cruising and the law = Although cruising is often not a crime in itself, there are many illegal activities associated with it, and as such cruises are often monitored by the police or even closed. The most commonly cited reasons for breaking up cruises are breach of the peace, caused by loud exhausts and sound systems disturbing local residents, and dangerous driving (such as street racing, burnouts and doughnuts). Police also claim that cruises are used as cover for drug dealing and are attended by stolen or otherwise illegal cars. More recently, police have been using ASBO laws which enable them to seize and impound cars if anti- social behaviour is taking place or if a group refuses to disperse from an area. As a result of increased police powers, legal cruises have been established such as Weston Wheels, although these tend to resemble car shows with camping, music stages and trade stalls. This passive, organised nature often does not satisfy the desires of cruisers, so illegal cruising continues. Many city councils have successfully placed court injunctions to prevent boy racers parking cars in areas that have been popular with them. = Magazines = Cruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car and Redline. In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene - preferring to concentrate on \\"dream\\" cars such as Nissan Skylines. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.

The term sterile neutrino is used to distinguish them from the known active neutrinos in the Standard Model, which carry an isospin charge of under the weak interaction. This term usually refers to neutrinos with right-handed chirality (see right- handed neutrino), which may be added to the Standard Model. Occasionally it is used in a general sense for any neutral fermion, instead of the more cautiously vague name neutral heavy leptons (NHLs) or heavy neutral leptons (HNLs). The existence of right-handed neutrinos is theoretically well- motivated, since all other known fermions have been observed with both left and right chirality, and since they could explain in a natural way the small active neutrino masses inferred from neutrino oscillation. The mass of the right-handed neutrinos themselves is unknown and could have any value between 1015 GeV and less than 1 eV. The number of sterile neutrino types (if they exist) is not yet constrained by theory. This is in contrast to the number of active neutrino types, which has to equal that of charged leptons and quark generations to ensure the electroweak interaction is free of anomalies. The search for sterile neutrinos is an active area of particle physics. If they exist and their mass is smaller than the energies of particles in the experiment, they can be produced in the laboratory, either by mixing between active and sterile neutrinos or in high energy particle collisions. If they are heavier, the only directly observable consequence of their existence would be the observed active neutrino masses. They may, however, be responsible for a number of unexplained phenomena in physical cosmology and astrophysics, including dark matter, baryogenesis or dark radiation. In May 2018, physicists of the MiniBooNE experiment reported a stronger neutrino oscillation signal than expected, a possible hint of sterile neutrinos. Motivation Experimental results show that all produced and observed neutrinos have left- handed helicities (spin antiparallel to momentum), and all antineutrinos have right-handed helicities, within the margin of error. In the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible chiralities is observed for either particle. These are the only helicities (and chiralities) included in the Standard Model of particle interactions. Recent experiments such as neutrino oscillation, however, have shown that neutrinos have a non-zero mass, which is not predicted by the Standard Model and suggests new, unknown physics. This unexpected mass explains neutrinos with right-handed helicity and antineutrinos with left-handed helicity: Since they do not move at the speed of light, their helicity is not relativistic invariant (it is possible to move faster than them and observe the opposite helicity). Yet all neutrinos have been observed with left-handed chirality, and all antineutrinos right-handed. Chirality is a fundamental property of particles and is relativisticly invariant: It is the same regardless of the particle's speed and mass in every inertial reference frame. However, a particle with mass that starts out with left-handed chirality can develop a right-handed component as it travels ‚Äì unless it is massless, chirality is not conserved during the propagation of a free particle through space. The question, thus, remains: Do neutrinos and antineutrinos differ only in their chirality? Or do exotic right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos exist as separate particles from the common left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos? Properties Such particles would belong to a singlet representation with respect to the strong interaction and the weak interaction, having zero electric charge, zero weak hypercharge, zero weak isospin, and, as with the other leptons, zero color charge, although they do have a quantum number of ‚àí1\\\\. If the standard model is embedded in a hypothetical SO(10) grand unified theory, they can be assigned an X charge of ‚àí5\\\\. The left-handed anti-neutrino has a of +1 and an X charge of +5. Due to the lack of electric charge, hypercharge, and color charge, sterile neutrinos would not interact electromagnetically, weakly, or strongly, making them extremely difficult to detect. They have Yukawa interactions with ordinary leptons and Higgs bosons, which via the Higgs mechanism leads to mixing with ordinary neutrinos. In experiments involving energies larger than their mass, sterile neutrinos would participate in all processes in which ordinary neutrinos take part, but with a quantum mechanical probability that is suppressed by a small mixing angle. That makes it possible to produce them in experiments, if they are light enough to be within the reach of current particle accelerators. They would also interact gravitationally due to their mass, and if they are heavy enough, could explain cold dark matter or warm dark matter. In some grand unification theories, such as SO(10), they also interact via gauge interactions which are extremely suppressed at ordinary energies because their gauge boson is extremely massive. They do not appear at all in some other GUTs, such as the Georgi‚ÄìGlashow model ( i.e., all its SU(5) charges or quantum numbers are zero). =Mass= All particles are initially massless under the Standard Model, since there are no Dirac mass terms in the Standard Model's Lagrangian. The only mass terms are generated by the Higgs mechanism, which produces non- zero Yukawa couplings between the left-handed components of fermions, the Higgs field, and their right-handed components. This occurs when the SU(2) doublet Higgs field \\\\phi acquires its non-zero vacuum expectation value, u, spontaneously breaking its SU(2)L √ó U(1) symmetry, and thus yielding non-zero Yukawa couplings: :\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\psi) = \\\\bar{\\\\psi}(i\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/)\\\\psi - G \\\\bar\\\\psi_L \\\\phi \\\\psi_R Such is the case for charged leptons, like the electron, but within the standard model the right-handed neutrino does not exist. So absent the sterile right chiral neutrinos to pair up with the left chiral neutrinos, even with Yukawa coupling the active neutrinos remain massless. In other words, there are no mass-generating terms for neutrinos under the Standard Model: For each generation, the model only contains a left- handed neutrino and its antiparticle, a right-handed antineutrino, each of which is produced in weak eigenstates during weak interactions; the \\"sterile\\" neutrinos are omitted. (See neutrino masses in the Standard Model for a detailed explanation.) In the seesaw mechanism, the model is extended to include the missing right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos; one of the eigenvectors of the neutrino mass matrix is then hypothesized to be remarkably heavier than the other. A sterile (right-chiral) neutrino would have the same weak hypercharge, weak isospin, and electric charge as its antiparticle, because all of these are zero and hence are unaffected by sign reversal. =Dirac and Majorana terms= Sterile neutrinos allow the introduction of a Dirac mass term as usual. This can yield the observed neutrino mass, but it requires that the strength of the Yukawa coupling be much weaker for the electron neutrino than the electron, without explanation. Similar problems (although less severe) are observed in the quark sector, where the top and bottom masses differ by a factor of 40. Unlike for the left- handed neutrino, a Majorana mass term can be added for a sterile neutrino without violating local symmetries (weak isospin and weak hypercharge) since it has no weak charge. However, this would still violate total lepton number. It is possible to include both Dirac and Majorana terms: this is done in the seesaw mechanism (below). In addition to satisfying the Majorana equation, if the neutrino were also its own antiparticle, then it would be the first Majorana fermion. In that case, it could annihilate with another neutrino, allowing neutrinoless double beta decay. The other case is that it is a Dirac fermion, which is not its own antiparticle. To put this in mathematical terms, we have to make use of the transformation properties of particles. For free fields, a Majorana field is defined as an eigenstate of charge conjugation. However, neutrinos interact only via the weak interactions, which are not invariant under charge conjugation (C), so an interacting Majorana neutrino cannot be an eigenstate of C. The generalized definition is: \\"a Majorana neutrino field is an eigenstate of the CP transformation\\". Consequently, Majorana and Dirac neutrinos would behave differently under CP transformations (actually Lorentz and CPT transformations). Also, a massive Dirac neutrino would have nonzero magnetic and electric dipole moments, whereas a Majorana neutrino would not. However, the Majorana and Dirac neutrinos are different only if their rest mass is not zero. For Dirac neutrinos, the dipole moments are proportional to mass and would vanish for a massless particle. Both Majorana and Dirac mass terms however can appear in the mass Lagrangian. =Seesaw mechanism= In addition to the left-handed neutrino, which couples to its family charged lepton in weak charged currents, if there is also a right-handed sterile neutrino partner (a weak isosinglet with zero charge) then it is possible to add a Majorana mass term without violating electroweak symmetry. Both neutrinos have mass and handedness is no longer preserved (thus \\"left or right-handed neutrino\\" means that the state is mostly left or right- handed). To get the neutrino mass eigenstates, we have to diagonalize the general mass matrix M_{ u}: :M_{ u} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0&m;_Dm_D&M;_{NHL}\\\\end{pmatrix} where M_{NHL} is big and m_D is of intermediate size terms. Apart from empirical evidence, there is also a theoretical justification for the seesaw mechanism in various extensions to the Standard Model. Both Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) and left-right symmetrical models predict the following relation: :m_{ u} \\\\ll m_D \\\\ll M_{NHL} According to GUTs and left-right models, the right-handed neutrino is extremely heavy: M_{NHL}\\\\approx 105 to 1012 GeV, while the smaller eigenvalue is approximately equal to :m_{ u} \\\\approx \\\\frac{m_D^2}{M_{NHL}} This is the seesaw mechanism: as the sterile right-handed neutrino gets heavier, the normal left-handed neutrino gets lighter. The left-handed neutrino is a mixture of two Majorana neutrinos, and this mixing process is how sterile neutrino mass is generated. Detection attempts The production and decay of sterile neutrinos could happen through the mixing with virtual (\\"off mass shell\\") neutrinos. There were several experiments set up to discover or observe NHLs, for example the NuTeV (E815) experiment at Fermilab or LEP-l3 at CERN. They all led to establishing limits to observation, rather than actual observation of those particles. If they are indeed a constituent of dark matter, sensitive X-ray detectors would be needed to observe the radiation emitted by their decays. Sterile neutrinos may mix with ordinary neutrinos via a Dirac mass after electroweak symmetry breaking, in analogy to quarks and charged leptons. Sterile neutrinos and (in more-complicated models) ordinary neutrinos may also have Majorana masses. In the type 1 seesaw mechanism both Dirac and Majorana masses are used to drive ordinary neutrino masses down and make the sterile neutrinos much heavier than the Standard Model's interacting neutrinos. In some models the heavy neutrinos can be as heavy as the GUT scale (). In other models they could be lighter than the weak gauge bosons W and Z as in the so-called ŒΩMSM model where their masses are between GeV and keV. A light (with the mass ) sterile neutrino was suggested as a possible explanation of the results of the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector experiment. On 11 April 2007, researchers at the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab announced that they had not found any evidence supporting the existence of such a sterile neutrino. More-recent results and analysis have provided some support for the existence of the sterile neutrino. Two separate detectors near a nuclear reactor in France found 3% of anti-neutrinos missing. They suggested the existence of a fourth neutrino with a mass of 1.2 eV. Sterile neutrinos are also candidates for dark radiation. Daya Bay has also searched for a light sterile neutrino and excluded some mass regions. Daya Bay Collaboration measured the anti-neutrino energy spectrum, and found that anti- neutrinos at an energy of around 5 MeV are in excess relative to theoretical expectations. It also recorded 6% missing anti-neutrinos. This could suggest either that sterile neutrinos exist or that our understanding of some other aspect of neutrinos is incomplete. The number of neutrinos and the masses of the particles can have large-scale effects that shape the appearance of the cosmic microwave background. The total number of neutrino species, for instance, affects the rate at which the cosmos expanded in its earliest epochs: More neutrinos means a faster expansion. The Planck Satellite 2013 data release is compatible with the existence of a sterile neutrino. The implied mass range is from 0‚Äì3 eV. In 2016, scientists at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory did not find any evidence for the sterile neutrino. However, in May 2018, physicists of the MiniBooNE experiment reported a stronger neutrino oscillation signal than expected, a possible hint of sterile neutrinos.

It is designed for use with the on-premises Skype for Business Server software, and a software as a service version offered as part of Office 365. It supports text, audio, and video chat, and integrates with Microsoft Office components such as Exchange and SharePoint. In 2015, the software was rebranded from Lync to Skype for Business, co-branding it with the Microsoft-owned consumer messaging platform Skype (which had begun to integrate with Lync in 2013). In September 2017, Microsoft announced that it would phase out Skype for Business in favor of Microsoft Teams, a new cloud- based collaboration platform. Support for Skype for Business Online will end in July 2021, and Skype for Business Server 2019 will receive extended support through October 14, 2025. History Microsoft released Office Communicator 2007 to production on July 28, 2007 and launched it on October 27, 2007. It was followed by Office Communicator 2007 R2, released on March 19, 2009. Microsoft released the successor to Office Communicator, Lync 2010, on January 25, 2011. In November 2010, the platform was renamed Lync. In May 2013, Microsoft announced that it would allow Lync users to communicate with Skype, a consumer IM platform it had acquired in 2011. This initially included support for text and voice communications. On November 11, 2014, Microsoft announced that Lync would be renamed Skype for Business in 2015, also adding support for video calls with Skype users. On September 22, 2015, Skype for Business 2016 was released alongside Office 2016. On October 27, 2016, the Skype for Business for Mac client was released. On September 25, 2017, Microsoft announced that Skype for Business would be discontinued in the future in favor of Microsoft Teams, a cloud-based collaboration platform for corporate groups (comparable to Slack) integrating persistent messaging, video conferencing, file storage, and application integration. Microsoft released a final on-premises version of Skype for Business Server as part of Office 2019 in late 2018, and announced in July 2019 that the hosted Skype for Business Online will cease functioning on July 31, 2021. Since September 2019, Skype for Business Online is no longer offered to new Office 365 subscribers, and are being directed to Microsoft Teams instead. Skype for Business Server 2019 is supported through October 14, 2025. As of 2020, Skype for Business lost its position to Zoom as the main mode of communication for businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This makes communications more secure, as messages do not need to leave the corporate intranet, unlike with the Internet-based Windows Live Messenger. The server can be set to relay messages to other instant messaging networks, avoiding installation of extra software at the client side. * A number of client types are available for Microsoft Lync, including mobile clients. * Uses SIP as the basis for its client communication protocol * Offers support for TLS and SRTP to encrypt and secure signaling and media traffic * Allows sharing files Note: With the release of Lync Server 2013 in October 2012, a new collaboration feature \\"Persistent Group Chat\\" which allows multi-party chat with preservation of content between chat sessions was introduced. However, only the native Windows OS client and no other platform supports this feature at this time. The main new features of this version are the addition of real-time multi-client collaborative software capabilities, (which allow teams of people to see and simultaneously work on the same documents and communications session). Lync implements these features as follows: * Collaboration through Whiteboard documents, where the participants have freedom to share text, drawing and graphical annotations. * Collaboration through PowerPoint documents, where the participants can control and see presentations, as well as allow everybody to add text, drawing and graphical annotations. * Polling lists, where Presenters can organize polls and all participants can vote and see results. * Desktop sharing, usually by allowing participants to see and collaborate on a Windows screen * Windows applications sharing, by allowing participants to see and collaborate on a specific application. All collaboration sessions get automatically defined as conferences, where clients can invite more contacts. Conference initiators (usually called \\"organizers\\") can either promote participants to act as presenters or demote them to act as attendees. They can also define some basic policies about what presenters and attendees can see and do. Deeper details of policy permissions are defined at server level. Following Microsoft's acquisition of Skype in May 2011, the Lync and Skype platforms could be connected, but sometimes only after lengthy provisioning time.http://www.networkworld.com/article/2166726/uc-voip/how-to-integrate- skype-with-microsoft-lync.html =Extensions= Lync uses a number of extensions to the SIP/SIMPLE instant-messaging protocol for some features. As with most instant-messaging platforms, non-Microsoft instant-messaging clients that have not implemented these publicly available extensions may not work correctly or have complete functionality. Lync supports federated presence and IM to other popular instant message services such as AOL, Yahoo, MSN, and any service using the XMPP protocol, although support for XMPP has been deprecated in Skype for Business 2019 . Text instant-messaging in a web browser is available via Lync integration within Exchange Outlook Web App. Although other IM protocols such as AIM and Yahoo! do have wider support by third-party clients, these protocols have been largely reverse-engineered by outside developers. Microsoft does offer details of its extensions on MSDN and provides an API kit to help developers build platforms that can interoperate with Lync Server and clients.

It is used in a question-answering application for German called InSicht. It is also used to create a tutoring application developed by the university of University of Hagen to teach MultiNet to knowledge engineers. MultiNet is claimed to be one of the most comprehensive and thoroughly described knowledge representation systems. It specifies conceptual structures by means of about 140 predefined relations and functions, which are systematically characterized and underpinned by a formal axiomatic apparatus. Apart from their relational connections, the concepts are embedded in a multidimensional space of layered attributes and their values. Another characteristic of MultiNet distinguishing it from simple semantic networks is the possibility to encapsulate whole partial networks and represent the resulting conceptual capsule as a node of higher order, which itself can be an argument of relations and functions. MultiNet has been used in practical NLP applications such as natural language interfaces to the Internet or question answering systems over large semantically annotated corpora with millions of sentences. MultiNet is also a cornerstone of the commercially available search engine SEMPRIA-Search, where it is used for the description of the computational lexicon and the background knowledge, for the syntactic-semantic analysis, for logical answer finding, as well as for the generation of natural language answers. MultiNet is supported by a set of software tools and has been used to build large semantically based computational lexicons. The tools include a semantic interpreter WOCADI, which translates natural language expressions (phrases, sentences, texts) into formal MultiNet expressions, a workbench MWR+ for the knowledge engineer (comprising modules for automatic knowledge acquisition and reasoning), and a workbench LIA+ for the computer lexicographer supporting the creation of large semantically based computational lexica.

Sunrunners, or faradhim (singular: faradhi), are people who are able to use the sun and moon, for communication and spellcasting. They weave the light with their thoughts, which are represented by coloured gemstones. Each faradhi has a unique colour pattern, and the gemstones representing a faradhis colours often symbolize facets of the person's character. Sunrunners are the impartial mediators of the Continent and the quickest form of communication. They communicate with each other all over the world, keeping families in contact, Princes and Lords aware of political happenings, and performing ceremonies - such as Namings, Choosings, or Burnings - as needed. Sunrunners are forbidden to participate in battle lest it is to save their own lives, to take sides in a debate, and most importantly they are forbidden to use their gifts to kill. Faradhi oaths also include a vow of silence to ensure the trust of Sunrunner messengers. These limitations enable the rest of the Continent to accept and even welcome Sunrunners to their courts and into their lives. Sunrunners are trained at Goddess Keep. As they train, they are tested to determine their rank. With each rank a Sunrunner earns a faradhi ring. There are ten ranks, the highest being the Lord or Lady of Goddess Keep, who governs all Sunrunners. Abilities *Captured Gaze: A faradhi could concentrate on another's gaze and hold them \\"enthralled\\". They cannot control another with this gaze, merely hold the person's undivided attention and appear intimidating. *Call Fire/Air: This is the first skill a faradhi usually learns. Fire is usually called first as it is light, which is the foundation of a Sunrunner's life. A fingerflame is often conjured in the air to give extra light. Both Fire and Air are used in ceremonies in conjunction with Water and Earth. This enables a Sunrunner to perform more complicated conjurings, such as looking into the Mothertree and seeing one's future children. *Conjuring: A Sunrunner learns how to conjure in Fire to earn his or her third ring and without Fire to earn his/her seventh ring. Faradh'im typically use conjurings to show images, not to watch events. *Memory: Sunrunners are trained to remember events exactly as they occur. They can recall actual memories - and even conjure them using sorcery - down to the last detail, they can quote entire conversations, and can memorize information instantaneously. *Sleep: Sunrunners of eight rings or higher can weave sleep around a person's mind. This dulls the light and clouds the senses until the person is unconscious. There are different depths of woven sleep. *Sorcery: Faradh'im can perform various types of sorcery, such as making a ros'salath and doing certain vivid conjurings. They can not do these castings as well as a diarmadhi, nor can they perform all types of sorcery. =Sunrunning= Every person is made up of colours and shadows. Each person has a unique colour pattern, which, for faradh'im, defines them more completely than their names. These colours are the person's mind and soul; if they are lost, the person dies, forever in darkness. Faradh'im can touch these colours and weave them into what only they - and diarmadh'im - can see: the light. They use their colours to weave themselves into the strands of sunlight and/or moonlight. As they weave into the light, they can travel over great distances, viewing the land below as if they were flying. Starlight, thought inaccessible by many, is forbidden to Sunrunners. To communicate, a Sunrunner weaves light and travels to another Sunrunner. The approaching faradhi gently brushes the other with his or her colours, so as not to intrude. The receiving faradhi usually weaves his/her own colours around the others and the two speak as their minds are essentially woven together. Powerful and/or well trained Sunrunners can also view images of memory from another's mind. In less polite circumstances they can pull memories forward, force their presence on others, and even seize minds in order to use those faradh'im 's powers to augment their own. Another person can also be used as a vessel from which a faradhi can see and hear the activity around the other person. Faradh'im can create a large weaving by adding their colours and power together. Usually one Sunrunner acts as the focal point of every mind and controls the weaving. Only very skilled Sunrunners - traditionally only the Lord or Lady of Goddess Keep - can weave many minds together and keep each unique colour pattern straight in their own mind. If the focal Sunrunner were to lose track of a colour pattern, that mind would be lost on the light. Being Shadow-lost is a Sunrunner's greatest fear. Shadow-lost is the term given to a Sunrunner who was Sunrunning and failed to make it back to his or her body before the sun's rays disappeared. In essence the soul is lost to the Dark Waters with the setting sun. The faradhi 's mind unravels in darkness and his or her colors are scattered and forgotten. The Sunrunner's body fades and eventually dies without the mind and soul. If the mind begins to fray or is lost in shadows, a sharp pain slices through the skull. The person feels as if a part of them is missing; the mind tries to reach out to its missing pieces, but it cannot as it is no longer whole. The bright colours that normally swirl around a faradhi become dark as the shadows of his or her own mind encroach, ready to consume the mind. Physically the person begins to shake wildly, their heart races, and pain shoots through bones and especially the head. A mind not entirely lost can be retrieved if its colours are known by others. The process of filtering out the shadows, unweaving the wrong colors, and sorting the lost faradhi 's colouring into their proper order is difficult work. It is painful for the fading faradhi as the colours around him/her feel like needles stabbing into the brain until (and if) the right pattern is restored. =Weaknesses= Crossing water and being pierced by iron while casting are Sunrunners' two major weaknesses. All full Sunrunners get violently ill when faced with having to cross a body of water (i.e. rivers, lakes, and especially the ocean), though a 'cure', with a heavy price, for this has been found in the drug dranath. If a faradhi must cross water they lose their stomachs and their consciousness. The Sunrunners remain insensible after they've been returned to land, the duration of their sorry state dependent on the water crossing's violence and expanse. As the Sunrunners wake their vision is often skewed or blurry. If a faradhi is pierced by iron while casting, they will die. This was the main reason for the tradition forbidding Sunrunners from participating in battle and using their gifts to kill. If the iron is removed from the Sunrunner quickly enough and the wound is not fatal, it is possible for the Sunrunner to survive, though he or she will have experienced a great, mind-numbing pain and will be very weak for a time afterward. Faradhi rings Faradhi rings signify a Sunrunner's rank and skills. They are worn proudly, though in ancient times (and by the Vellant'im) the rings were collected as trophies after a Sunrunner was slain. In order to protect themselves from the diarmadh'im, ancient Sunrunners cast their rings from a special metal that would burn a diarmadhi wearing the rings in warning if he or she was in the presence of sorcery; however, if the wearer of the rings cast a sorcerer's spell the rings would only tingle \\"as if in protest.\\" =Traditional rings= *1 middle finger, right hand, silver - Call Fire *2 index finger, left hand, gold - Call Air *3 index finger, right hand, silver - Conjures in Fire *4 pinky finger, left hand, silver - Apprentice Sunrunner *5 thumb, right hand, gold - Sunrunner, Apprentice Moonrunner *6 pinky finger, right hand, silver - Moonrunner *7 middle finger, left hand, gold - Conjures without Fire *8 thumb, left hand, silver - Teacher *9 ring finger, right hand, silver - Master *10 ring finger, left hand, gold - Lady/Lord of Goddess Keep =Ring changes= *6 pinky finger, right hand, silver - Apprentice Moonrunner *7 middle finger, left hand, silver - Moonrunner *8 thumb, left hand, gold - Teacher, Master (later Master Physician) *9 ring finger, right hand, silver - Devri (Lords of Light) *10 ring finger, left hand, gold - Lord/Lady of Goddess Keep Goddess Keep Goddess Keep is the home of the Sunrunners. It is where most reside and all - until the recent times of Sunrunner Lords - are trained. Most children are sent to Goddess Keep between the ages of eleven and thirteen, their parents having noticed an oddity about them, or a distractedness. If the child does in fact possess the skill to be a Sunrunner he or she is trained. If not, then there are servant, guard, or steward positions available within the Keep. The Keep itself is located on the coast of Ossetia. Ancient Sunrunners (Merisel, Gerik, and Rosseyn) built Goddess Keep after they left their isolated home on Dorval. Their choice was an odd one for Sunrunners as this part of Ossetia was fog bond through the winter months. Near the Keep is a small grove and a pond in which various rituals are conducted. =Hierarchy= *Lord/Lady of Goddess Keep: The Keep and all Sunrunners are governed by the Lord or Lady of Goddess Keep. This Lord or Lady is the 'closest' to the Goddess, who sometimes communes with the chosen Lord/Lady in the form of visions. The Lord/Lady represents the impartiality of the Goddess at such gatherings as the Rialla. He/she stamps all new treaties and laws with the seal of Goddess Keep. It is also the duty of the lord/lady to call a council of Princes in order to confirm a new ruling Prince or High Prince. While the Lord/Lady is required to follow the general laws of the Continent he/she is not directly under the command of any Prince, nor is Goddess Keep itself under the governing of the Princedom of Ossetia, within whose borders the Keep resides, but is held of the High Prince. The position of Lord or Lady of Goddess Keep - contrary to recent history - is not hereditary. *Chief Steward of Goddess Keep: This is the traditional second in command position at the Keep. This Steward oversees the training of young Sunrunners among other duties. A chief duty is to create the rings of faradhi. Until Riyan, ruler of Skybowl and half-faradhi- diarmadhi, discovered that his rings burned in response to nearby sorcery no one knew why Sunrunner gold was special. This special gold was embued with power by Lady Merisel, and Lords Gerik & Rosseyn. * Devr'im: This position was created by Andry, Lord of Goddess Keep. The term means 'Lords of Light' in the Old Tongue. These Lords of Light were trained to defend Goddess Keep by way of the ros'slath, to use their gifts in combat, and even to kill if necessary - something hitherto forbidden to a Sunrunner. Devr'im also developed the faradhi technique of shape-shifting, an illusion they wrap around themselves to change their outward appearance. Devr'im are also identified in several cases to be diarmadhi. The Old Blood in them helps them to use their gifts to construct the ros'slath and protect the faradhi participants from iron piercing the constructed wall. Devr'im are also the only faradhi that are permitted the use of dranath, an addictive drug that enhances gifts and cures the Vellanti'm plague. *Teacher/Master/Master Physician: These are the trainers of young Sunrunners. After Andry became Lord of Goddess Keep the position of Master Physician was created to teach and administer the Healing Arts. This was done after an incident involving a Sunrunner who accidentally killed a wealthy merchant, Master Thacri. Cabar, prince of Gilad, and Andry fought over jurisdiction to punish the faradhi and when they appealed to Rohan to decide, he took the decision from them based on the fact they both had equal claims of jurisdiction. Rohan and Sioned then used this incident to establish the Physicians school in Gilad. *Second Steward of Goddess Keep: This steward takes care of the everyday running of the Keep and does not have to be a Sunrunner nor one in training. =Rituals and traditions= *Man- making or Woman-making Night: The night after the reception of the first ring - for Calling Fire - the Sunrunner is cloaked in darkness and visited by trained Sunrunners of the opposite gender in order to learn the pleasures of the flesh and the joy and light experienced in the bedroom. The faradh'im wear no rings, cannot speak, and can only feel a vague male or female form in the darkness. One of the lessons learned in this ritual is the difference between bed sport and love, the latter being much preferred. This ritual enables the Sunrunner to visit the Mantree or Womantree. The visiting faradhi must wear at least six rings. Precautions are taken to ensure no child is born of this night. *Faces in Fire: In a grove near Goddess Keep there is a spring surrounded by five pine trees. Each tree represents Child, Maiden/Youth, Woman/Man, Mother/Father, and Hag/Graybeard, respectively. Sunrunners go to this grove in the hope of seeing a vision of their future. They approach in the nude and kneel before the trees. They take Water from the spring and offer it to the appropriate trees. For example, the morning after the woman-making night, the Sunrunner offers the Water to the Child, Maiden, and Woman trees. She then calls Fire, blows Air onto it, and cuts a piece of her hair to represent Earth. She concentrates on the Womantree with her hands in the Water. The Sunrunner's reflection stares back at her, then the Fire leaps and reveals an older version of the Sunrunner. Often the Fire will flare again to reveal the face of the man with whom she will spend her life. However, these visions given by the Goddess can be changed as they can be warnings as well as promises. *Court Sunrunners: A Sunrunner who has earned six often is appointed to a Court by the Lord/Lady of Goddess Keep. These Court Sunrunners act as communication beacons and are also seen as symbols of prestige to the Lord whose Court houses one. After gathering and sharing information as at a court, a Sunrunner can return to Goddess Keep and either continue their training or help as needed around the keep. *Itinerant Sunrunners: A Sunrunner who travels from place to place, working as needed. These Sunrunners have at least five faradhi rings, so that they can use both sunlight and moonlight to communicate and perform other duties that befit a Sunrunner. Known Faradh'im Here is a list of known faradh'im. Some powerful Sunrunners, such as Urival and Torien, were actually diarmadh'im and thus not on this list.

He was born in Collooney, County Sligo, Ireland. His father (d. 1777) was also called Dr. Bryan Higgins. Higgins entered the University of Leiden in 1765, whence he qualified as a doctor of physics. He subsequently ran a School of Practical Chemistry at 13 Greek Street, Soho, London during the 1770s, which was patronised by the then Duke of Northumberland amongst others. He was more of a speculator than an experimenter, and published many works on chemistry and related disciplines. Joseph Priestley was an attendee of Higgins's lectures, but the two became enemies following a dispute over experiments on air (Priestley at the time was working on his six-volume tome Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air). At some point between 1780 and 1790, Higgins visited Saint Petersburg at the favour of Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia. He returned to London in January 1794 to continue his lectures at the School of Practical Chemistry. In 1779, Higgins obtained a patent for a cheap and durable cement, \\"...composed of sand and lime, and a certain proportion of bone-ashes, the lime being slaked with limewater instead of common water, and the mixture made use of as rapidly as possible after being made\\". In 1797, Higgins was hired by a public committee in Jamaica for the improvement of the manufacture of Muscovado sugar and rum. He resided in Jamaica from 1797 to 1799. According to Higgins's atomic theory, central particles were surrounded by atmospheres of caloric, a model that was similar to the ideas adopted by John Dalton. It has been argued that Dalton knew of, and was influenced by, Higgins's theories, although Dalton never acknowledged Higgins's anticipation of his caloric model. Higgins died at his estate in Walford, Staffordshire, England, in 1818. Published works *Higgins, Bryan; (1776). A Philosophical Essay concerning Light, vol i, London. *Higgins, Bryan; (1775 - 1776).

Diomedes and Odysseus stole his team of fine horses during a night raid on the Trojan camp.  Etymology  His name (a Thracian anthroponym) probably derives from PIE *reg-, 'to rule', showing a satem-sound change.Another possible meaning is 'rreze', the albanian name for sunray. Family According to Homer, his father was Eioneus who may be connected to the historic Eion in western Thrace, at the mouth of the Strymon, and the port of the later Amphipolis. Later writers provide Rhesus with a more exotic parentage, claiming that his mother was one of the Muses (Calliope, Euterpe, or Terpsichore) and his father the river god Strymon. Stephanus of Byzantium mentions the name of Rhesus' sister Sete, who had a son Bithys with Ares.Stephanus of Byzantium, s. v. Bithyai  Mythology  Rhesus was raised by fountain nymphs and died without engaging in battle.Rhesus Rhesus is chiefly remembered because he came from Thrace to defend Troy with great pomp and circumstance, but died on the night of his arrival, without ever engaging in battle. He arrived late to Troy, because his country was attacked by Scythia, right after he received word that the Greeks had attacked Troy. Dolon, who had gone out to spy on Agamemnon‚Äôs army for Hector, was caught by Diomedes and Odysseus and proceeded to tell the two Argives about the newest arrivals, Thracians under the leadership of Rhesus. Dolon explained that Rhesus had the finest horses, as well as huge, golden armor that was suitable for gods rather than mortals. Because of Dolon‚Äôs cowardice, Rhesus met his demise without ever getting the chance to defend himself or Troy. When the Thracians were sleeping, Diomedes and Odysseus attacked the camp in the dead of night, killing Rhesus in his tent and stealing his famous steeds. The event portrayed in the Iliad also provides the action of the play Rhesus, transmitted among the plays of Euripides. The mother of Rhesus, one of the nine muses, then arrived and laid blame on all those responsible: Odysseus, Diomedes, and Athena. She also announced the imminent resurrection of Rhesus, who will become immortal but will be sent to stay in a cave. Scholia to the Iliad episode and the Rhesus agree in giving Rhesus a more heroic stature, incompatible with Homer's version.See Bernard Fenik, Iliad x and the Rhesus: The Myth (Brussels: Latomus) 1964, who makes a case for pre-Homeric epic materials concerning Rhesus. Rhesus is also named as one of the eight rivers that Poseidon raged from Mount Ida to the sea in order to knock down the wall that the Achaeans built. There was also a river in Bithynia named Rhesus, with Greek myth providing an attendant river god of the same name. Rhesus the Thracian king was himself associated with Bithynia through his love with the Bithynian huntress Arganthone, in the Erotika Pathemata [\\"Sufferings for Love\\"] by Parthenius of Nicaea, chapter 36. Legacy Rhesus Glacier on Anvers Island in Antarctica is named after Rhesus of Thrace,Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica: Rhesus Glacier. as is the Jovian asteroid 9142 Rhesus. In the motion picture Hercules, Tobias Santelmann plays a character named Rhesus, who lives in the vicinity of Thrace but has little else in common with the traditional character, instead being a rebel against King Cotys.

Konstantin Nikolayevich Leontiev (; January 25, 1831 in Kudinovo, Kaluga Governorate ‚Äì November 24, 1891 in Sergiyev Posad) was a conservative tsarist and imperial monarchist Russian philosopher who advocated closer cultural ties between Russia and the East against what he believed to be the West's catastrophic egalitarian, utilitarian and revolutionary influences. He also advocated Russia's cultural and territorial expansion eastward to India, Tibet and China.  Life  Leontiev was born and grew up on his father's estate. His father, a nobleman, was a military officer but was discharged for \\"riotous behaviour\\". Still, the intervention of the Russian empress in behalf of the Leontiev brothers made him able to enter the Imperial Corps of Pages. He was engaged at 23 but broke off the relationship for the sake of \\"freedom and art\\"\\" a decision that made things difficult for him. After completing medical school in Moscow, Leontiev saw service as a doctor during the Crimean War. In 1861, he carried off a local Crimean girl, the daughter of a Greek merchant, from Feodosiya, eventually marrying her. He later lived in various Ottoman towns as a Russian consular agent, devoting his leisure time to writing oriental fiction on many themes, some of which included a condemnation of anti-homosexuality and implied that he may have been bisexual.Nicholas Rzhevsky. (1983). Russian literature and ideology: Herzen, Dostoevsky, Leontiev, Tolstoy, Fadeyev. Champaign, Illinois: University of Illinois Press In the summer of 1871, after praying to the Virgin Mary, he was cured of cholera and dysentery and promised Her to take monastic vows. Later that fall, he moved to the Russian monastery on Mount Athos. In 1880, he moved to the censorship department in Moscow, where he published several acclaimed analyses of Leo Tolstoy's novels. Seven years later, he secretly took the tonsure at the Optina monastery, famous for its startsy. He died as a monk in the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra.  Works and political thought  Leontiev's most remarkable book is a volume of essays, The East, Russia, and Slavdom (1885‚Äì1886). Like Nikolay Danilevsky and Fyodor Dostoyevsky before him, he was ill at ease with the Western consumer society and the cult of material prosperity. Leontiev regarded traditional Russian Byzantinism as a blessing and a strong antidote against further liberalisation of the country's society. His aesthetic and political theories had some similarities to those of Friedrich Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler. Preceding the latter's theory of the cyclical nature of civilizations and The Decline of the West by several decades, Leontiev proposed that all societies undergo a state of flowering and increasing complexity followed by one of \\"secondary simplification\\", decay and, ultimately, death. Leontiev felt that the West had reached the beginning of secondary simplification. A pessimist, Leontiev made several predictions that turned out to come true. He prophesied that in the 20th century, there would be a bloody revolution in Russia led by an \\"anti- Christ\\" that would be socialist and tyrannical in nature and whose rulers would wield even more power than their tsarist predecessors. He said, \\"Socialism is the feudalism of the future\\".Robert Conquest, The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine, Oxford University Press New York (1986) He felt that only the harshest reaction could prevent that scenario. He also predicted that Germany would grow strong enough to make up to two wars against Russia and that China also would eventually threaten Russia's power. He also claimed that technology would one day lead to universal destruction.

The first version operated from 1940 to 1947; a revived service operated from 1953 to 1970. The \\"Ak-Sar-Ben\\" portion of name was created by spelling Nebraska (Neb-ras-ka) backwards and taken from a fraternal organization of the same name. \\"Zephyr\\" was a name applied by the CB&Q; to many of its trains, beginning with the Pioneer Zephyr in 1934. The name derived from \\"Zephyrus\\", the Greek god of the west wind.  History  The first Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr was an eastbound-only daylight service between Lincoln, Nebraska and Chicago. The journey took nine hours. The train's consist included new lightweight equipment and traditional heavyweight cars. The \\"Ak-Sar-Ben\\" portion of name was created by spelling Nebraska (Neb-ras-ka) backwards; a fraternal organization (the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben) and an arena and horse racing facility in Omaha have also used the name. The Advance Flyer provided westward service. The new service began on December 11, 1940. The CB&Q; ended this service in 1947; replacing it with the new Nebraska Zephyr. The second Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr was an overnight service between Chicago and Lincoln which used a mixture of 1940s equipment and new cars which it pooled with the California Zephyr, including a \\"Vista-Dome\\" dome car. Although gradually downgraded during the 1960s the train survived into the Burlington Northern era before being discontinued in August 1970. Route The westbound, as of April 26, 1964, was: *Chicago, Illinois - departed at 10:00 p.m. *La Grange, Illinois *Aurora, Illinois *Mendota, Illinois *Kewanee, Illinois *Galesburg, Illinois *Monmouth, Illinois (Flag Stop) *Burlington, Iowa *Mount Pleasant, Iowa *Fairfield, Iowa *Ottumwa, Iowa *Albia, Iowa *Chariton, Iowa *Osceola, Iowa *Creston, Iowa *Corning, Iowa (Flag Stop) *Villisca, Iowa (Flag Stop) *Red Oak, Iowa *Council Bluffs, Iowa *Omaha, Nebraska *Lincoln, Nebraska - arrived at 9:15 a.m. The eastbound train departed Lincoln at 9:00 p.m., arriving at Chicago Union Station the following morning at 7:50 a.m. Equipment In 1938‚Äì1940 the Budd Company constructed a fleet of lightweight cars for the CB&Q; for use on various routes. This fleet included baggage cars, dining cars (48 seats), dining-parlor-observation cars, and coaches. Each of these carried a name starting with \\"Silver\\", as had become the custom with the CB&Q;'s Zephyrs. The lightweight equipment for the 1940 Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr came from this pool. The 1953 Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr used both pre-World War II coaches and new equipment manufactured in 1952 for the California Zephyr. The coaches were part of the pool used for the 1940 iteration, among other trains. The westbound Ak-Sar-Ben would use the following cars off the arriving eastbound California Zephyr: * 48-seat dining car * 10-roomette 6-double bedroom sleeping car * 10-roomette 6-double bedroom sleeping car * 16-section sleeping car * 1-drawing room 3-double bedroom Vista-Dome dome-buffet-lounge-observation car The cars off the eastbound Ak- Sar-Ben Zephyr would in turn be used by that day's westbound California Zephyr.

As a geological feature, it is unique in Australia. The Springs form part of Aboriginal tradition and life in northern South Australia, being a place associated with many Dreamtime stories and songs. Evidence of large camp sites are found at the Springs, some of which are thousands of square metres in size, and there are many stone artefacts found scattered around the area. The Springs were given their English name by surveyor Richard Randall Knuckey around 1870, when he was working on the Overland Telegraph Line. In 1915, the total flow rate of the Dalhousie Springs complex was over /second, but drilling had reduced this to /second by 2000.Threats to Australian desert springs Witjira-Dalhousie Springs was added to the Australian National Heritage List in August 2009. In 1980, It was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. The water temperatures in the springs range from 38 to 43 degrees Celsius. The water is highly mineralised but just drinkable. There are a number of unique species of fish that live in the waters around Dalhousie Springs, such as the Dalhousie catfish (Neosilurus gloveri), the Dalhousie hardyhead (Craterocephalus dalhousiensis) and the Dalhousie goby (Chlamydogobius gloveri). Dalhousie Springs is a popular starting point for crossing the Simpson Desert eastwards to Birdsville in Queensland (around ).

It is a measure of the discrepancy between the data and an estimation model. A small RSS indicates a tight fit of the model to the data. It is used as an optimality criterion in parameter selection and model selection. In general, total sum of squares = explained sum of squares + residual sum of squares. For a proof of this in the multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) case, see partitioning in the general OLS model. One explanatory variable In a model with a single explanatory variable, RSS is given by: :\\\\operatorname{RSS} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2 where yi is the ith value of the variable to be predicted, xi is the ith value of the explanatory variable, and f(x_i) is the predicted value of yi (also termed \\\\hat{y_i}). In a standard linear simple regression model, y_i = a+bx_i+\\\\varepsilon_i\\\\,, where a and b are coefficients, y and x are the regressand and the regressor, respectively, and Œµ is the error term. The sum of squares of residuals is the sum of squares of estimates of Œµi; that is :\\\\operatorname{RSS} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\varepsilon_i)^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta x_i))^2 where \\\\alpha is the estimated value of the constant term a and \\\\beta is the estimated value of the slope coefficient b. Matrix expression for the OLS residual sum of squares The general regression model with observations and explanators, the first of which is a constant unit vector whose coefficient is the regression intercept, is : y = X \\\\beta + e where is an n √ó 1 vector of dependent variable observations, each column of the n √ó k matrix is a vector of observations on one of the k explanators, \\\\beta is a k √ó 1 vector of true coefficients, and is an n√ó 1 vector of the true underlying errors. The ordinary least squares estimator for \\\\beta is : X \\\\hat \\\\beta = y \\\\iff : X^\\\\operatorname{T} X \\\\hat \\\\beta = X^\\\\operatorname{T} y \\\\iff : \\\\hat \\\\beta = (X^\\\\operatorname{T} X)^{-1}X^\\\\operatorname{T} y. The residual vector \\\\hat e = y - X \\\\hat \\\\beta = y - X (X^\\\\operatorname{T} X)^{-1}X^\\\\operatorname{T} y; so the residual sum of squares is: :\\\\operatorname{RSS} = \\\\hat e ^\\\\operatorname{T} \\\\hat e = \\\\ \\\\hat e \\\\^2 , (equivalent to the square of the norm of residuals). In full: :\\\\operatorname{RSS} = y^\\\\operatorname{T} y - y^\\\\operatorname{T} X(X^\\\\operatorname{T} X)^{-1} X^\\\\operatorname{T} y = y^\\\\operatorname{T} [I - X(X^\\\\operatorname{T} X)^{-1} X^\\\\operatorname{T}] y = y^\\\\operatorname{T} [I - H] y, where is the hat matrix, or the projection matrix in linear regression.

He was a Neopythagorean and forerunner of the Neoplatonists.  Philosophy  Statements and fragments of his apparently very numerous works have been preserved by Origen, Theodoret, and especially by Eusebius, and from them we may learn the nature of his Platonist- Pythagorean philosophy, and its approximation to the doctrines of Plato. Numenius was a Neopythagorean, but his object was to trace the doctrines of Plato up to Pythagoras, and at the same time to show that they were not at variance with the dogmas and mysteries of the Brahmins, Jews, Magi and Egyptians.See the Fragments of the 1st book Peri Tagathou, in Eusebius, Praep. Evang., ix. 7. His intention was to restore the philosophy of Plato, the genuine Pythagorean and mediator between Socrates and Pythagoras in its original purity, cleared from the Aristotelian and Stoic doctrines, and purified from the unsatisfactory and perverse explanations, which he said were found even in Speusippus and Xenocrates, and which, through the influence of Arcesilaus and Carneades had led to a bottomless skepticism.See especially Eusebius, Praep. Ev. xiv. 5. His work on the apostasy of the Academy from Plato, to judge from its rather numerous fragments,Euseb. Praep. Ev. xiv. 5-9 contained a minute and wearisome account of the outward circumstances of those men, and was full of fabulous tales about their lives, without entering into the nature of their skepticism. George Karamanolis from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy noted, \\"The remains of Numenius' work leave no doubt that he relied primarily on texts of Plato in constructing his own system of principles. Ancient testimonies are, however, divided between those that classify him as a Platonist philosopher (Porphyry, Life of Plot. 14.12, Eusebius, Prep. Ev. XI.21.7) and those that consider him a Pythagorean (Origen, Against Celsus I.15, VI.51, V.38 frs. 1b‚Äì1c, 53, Porphyry, Ad Gaurum 34.20‚Äì35.2; fr. 36, Calcidius, In Timaeum 297.8 Waszink; fr. 52.2). We should not see any contradiction or even tension in this double classification. Numenius is a Pythagorean Platonist like Moderatus half a century earlier or Eudorus around the turn of the millenium. That is, Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy‚Äîincluding Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally (cf. fr. 24.57-60).\\" His books On the Good (Peri Tagathou - Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ§·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏Œø·ø¶) seem to have been of a better kind; in them he had minutely explained, mainly in opposition to the Stoics, that existence could neither be found in the elements because they were in a perpetual state of change and transition, nor in matter because it is vague, inconstant, lifeless, and in itself not an object of our knowledge; and that, on the contrary, existence, in order to resist the annihilation and decay of matter, must itself rather be incorporeal and removed from all mutability,Eusebius, Praep. Ev., xv. 17 in eternal presence, without being subject to the variation of time, simple and imperturbable in its nature by its own will as well as by influence from without.Eusebius, Praep. Ev., xi. 10. True existence is identical with the first god existing in and by itself, that is, with good, and is defined as spirit (nous).Eusebius, Praep. Ev., xi. 18, ix. 22 But as the first (absolute) god existing in itself and being undisturbed in its motion, could not be creative (demiurgikos - Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒπŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œåœÇ), he thought that we must assume a second god, who keeps matter together, directs its energy to it and to intelligible essences, and imparts its spirit to all creatures; its mind is directed to the first god, in whom it beholds the ideas according to which it arranges the world harmoniously, being seized with a desire to create the world. The first god communicates its ideas to the second, without losing them itself, just as we communicate knowledge to one another, without depriving ourselves of it.Eusebius, Praep. Ev., xi. 18. In regard to the relation existing between the third and second god, and to the manner in which they also are to be conceived as one (probably in opposition to the vague duration of matter), no information can be derived from the fragments which have come down to us.  Numenius and Judaism and Christianity  Numenius is quoted by multiple ancient writers as having referred to Plato as the \\"Atticizing Moses,\\"Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, i. 22; Eusebius, Praep. Evang., xi. 10; Suda, Numenius i.e., the Hellenic Moses.Bezalel Bar- Kochva The Image of the Jews in Greek Literature: The Hellenistic Period 2009see Treatise of the Good First book, Practical Questions 13 Plato as a Greek Moses In On the Good (Book 3, fr 10a), Numenius even sets out a story about Jesus (though he doesn‚Äôt mention the name), and speaks of Moses and Egyptian sages. George Karamanolis further notes, \\"Such attention to the Jewish tradition is important for the early Christian theologians and apologists who want to establish the superiority of the Jewish-Christian tradition against that of the pagan culture. This attention however is not motivated by historical concerns on the part of Numenius but rather by philosophical ones. Numenius wanted to show that the Jewish nation must be counted among the ancient ones that have a share in logos and also that Moses had a conception of the first principle similar to that of Plato, since both identified God with being.\\" His chief divergence from Plato is the distinction between the \\"first god\\" and the \\"demiurge.\\" This is probably due to the influence of Jewish-Alexandrian philosophers (especially Philo and his theory of the Logos). According to Proclus,Proclus, Comment. in Timaeum, 93 his works were highly esteemed by the Neoplatonists, and Plotinus' student Amelius (who was critical of Gnosticism, see Neoplatonism and Gnosticism)Professor John D Turner considers Plotinus, Porphyry, and Amelius all to be Neoplatonic philosophers who were critical of Gnosticism. Professor Turner is quoted \\"In the late third century, Sethianism also became estranged from orthodox (Neo)Platonism under the impetus of attacks and refutations from the circle of Plotinus and other Neoplatonists which were just as effective as those of the Christian heresiologists. At this time, whatever Sethianism was left became increasingly fragmented into various derivative and other sectarian gnostic groups such as the Archontics, Audians, Borborites, Phibionites and others, some of which survived into the Middle Ages.\\" is said to have composed nearly two books of commentaries upon them. Contrary to orthodox Judeo-Christian teaching (and more in line with the teachings of Gnosticism), like Orpheus and Platohttp://classics.mit.edu/Plato/cratylus.html Numenius wrote of the human body as a prison of the soul.Book three the Initiate (or the Hoopoe, the bird of prognostication) pg 43 The soul is retained in the body as in a Prison , by the impulsive passion. The Neoplatonic Writings of Numenius Translated by Kenneth Guthrie Selene Books Numenius, according to Professor Michael Wagner showed gnostic tendencies in viewing matter as coeval with God.Introduction to the writing of Numenius by Michael Wagner The Neoplatonic Writings of Numenius Translated by Kenneth Guthrie Selene Books ISDN 0-933601-03-4  Works  Fragments of his treatises on the points of divergence between the Academicians and Plato, on the Good (in which according to Origen, Contra Celsum, iv. 51, he makes allusion to Jesus Christ), and on the mystical sayings in Plato, are preserved in the Praeparatio Evangelica of Eusebius.

Vernon Baptist Church cemetery, in Cuthbert, GA Lena Baker (June 8, 1900 ‚Äì March 5, 1945) was an African American maid in Cuthbert, Georgia, United States, who was convicted of capital murder of her white employer, Ernest Knight. She was executed by the state of Georgia in 1945. Baker was the only woman in Georgia to be executed by electrocution. The slaying and execution came during a decades-long period of state suppression of civil rights of black citizens in white-dominated Georgia. The state had disenfranchised black people since the turn of the century, and imposed legal racial segregation and second-class status on them. At the time of the trial, a local newspaper reported that Baker was held as a \\"slave woman\\" by Knight, and that she shot him in self-defense during a struggle. In 2005, sixty years after her execution, the state of Georgia granted Baker a full and unconditional pardon. A biography was published about Baker in 2001, and it was adapted for the feature film The Lena Baker Story (2008), chronicling the events of her life, trial, and execution. Early life Lena Baker was born June 8, 1900, to a family of sharecroppers and raised near Cuthbert, Georgia. Her family, which included three siblings, moved to the county seat when she was a child. As a youth, she and her siblings all worked as farm laborers; she chopped cotton for a farmer named J.A. Cox. By the 1940s, Baker was the mother of three children and worked as a maid to support her family. Killing In 1944, Baker started working for Ernest Knight, an older white man who had broken his leg. He owned a gristmill and, upon sexually assaulting Lena multiple times, he would keep her there imprisoned for days at a time in \\"near slavery.\\"Guest Commentary: Lela Bond Phillips, \\"The Lena Baker Story: Execution in a small town\\", The Black Commentator, May 2003, accessed June 24, 2016 Knight's son and townspeople disliked their relationship, and tried to end it through threatening Baker. One night an argument between the two ensued, during which Knight threatened Baker with an iron bar. As she tried to escape, they struggled over his pistol and she shot and killed him. She immediately reported the incident and said she had acted in self-defense. Trial and execution Lena Baker was charged with capital murder and stood trial on August 14, 1944. The trial was presided over by Judge William \\"Two Gun\\" Worrill, who kept a pair of pistols in view on his judicial bench. At her trial, Baker testified that Knight forced her to go with him on that Saturday evening of April 29. The town disliked their sexual relationship and the county sheriff had warned her to stay away from Knight, or risk being sent to jail. But she was afraid of Knight's physical abuse; he had forced relations on her. His son had also beat her on another occasion, warning her to stay away from his father. Baker said she got away from Knight that night and slept in the woods. As she returned to Cuthbert the next morning, Knight cornered her, taking her to the gristmill and locking her in. When Knight returned, Baker told him she was leaving. According to Baker, they \\"tussled over the pistol,\\" after he threatened her with an iron bar. She immediately reported it to J.A. Cox, the county coroner who had previously employed her. The all-white, all-male jury rejected Baker's plea of self- defense and convicted her of capital murder by the end of the first day of the trial. This charge carried an automatic death sentence. In addition to the legal racial segregation imposed by the white-dominated Georgia legislature, it had disenfranchised most black people since the turn of the century, which disqualified them from jury service. After Baker's court-appointed counsel, W.L. Ferguson, filed an appeal, he dropped Baker as a client. Governor Ellis Arnall granted Baker a 60-day reprieve so that the Board of Pardons and Parole could review the case, but in January 1945 it denied Baker clemency. She was transferred to Georgia State Prison at Reidsville on February 23, 1945. Baker was executed on March 5, 1945. She was buried in an unmarked grave behind Mount Vernon Baptist Church, where she had sung in the choir. Posthumous pardon In 1998, members of the congregation arranged for a simple headstone for her grave. That year two articles were published about her case.Woolner, Ann. \\"Condemned in a Day,\\" Fulton County Daily Report, March 9, 1998; Woolner, Ann. \\"Lena Baker: Postscript,\\" Fulton County Daily Report, March 16, 1998 In 2003, descendants of Baker's family began to mark the anniversary of her death and Mother's Day at her graveside. That year Baker's grandnephew, Roosevelt Curry, requested an official pardon from the state, aided by the Georgia-based prison advocacy group, Prison and Jail Project. In 2005, the Parole Board granted Baker a full and unconditional pardon. Commentators have suggested that in 1945, the Board of Pardons and Parole could have lowered her charge to voluntary manslaughter, which would have carried an average 15-year sentence and saved her life. Representation in other media In 2001, Lela Bond Phillips, a professor at Andrew College, published a biography titled The Lena Baker Story, which was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 2008. Tichina Arnold played the role of Lena Baker.

M. Briggs, The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature, p 33 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967 Atkinson, Philip _Folk Tales of North East England_ (http://viewbook.at/FolkTalesEngland) The events are said to have taken place in the 16th or 17th century and there are several legends concerning the ghost's origins. Legend One story states that the stable boy was caught courting Baron Hylton's daughter, and was killed. Another version says that the baron ordered that his horse be prepared for an important journey, but Skelton had overslept. There are several versions of what happened next. The enraged baron was said to have either decapitated the boy, stabbed him with a nearby pitchfork, or hit him on the back of the head with a riding crop, striking a spot that had been injured (and weakened) the day before, causing a fatal blow. The baron was then reported to have disposed of the body in a deep pond, or an unused well. Several months later, the body was recovered. The baron was tried for Skelton's murder, but had an alibi. An old farm worker stated that the baron had ordered the boy to remove a tool from the top shelf in the barn, and the boy had fallen, seriously wounding himself in the process. The baron had tended to the wounds, but the boy had died. It is on record that Robert Hylton, 13th Baron Hylton was pardoned in 1609. Soon afterwards, strange events began to occur in the castle. The kitchen would be tidied at night if left in a mess, or messed up if left tidy. An unseen person would take hot ashes from the fires, and lie on them, leaving an imprint of a body. Chamber pots were emptied on the floor. After a while, a cook stayed up until midnight to see who was causing the mischief. He saw the ghost of a naked boy, and heard him crying \\"I'm cauld\\" (\\"I'm cold\\"). The cook and his wife left a warm cloak for the ghost, and the next night they heard, \\"Here's a cloak and here's a hood, the Cauld Lad of Hylton will do no more good.\\" The ghost disappeared and the strange occurrences ceased, though even now people claim to have heard the ghostly cries of the Cauld Lad. Illustration of a brownie from Jacob's English Fairy Tales The behaviour of the ghost suggests a poltergeist. Other versions of the tale describe the Cauld Lad as an elf, barghest Henry Tegner, Ghosts of The North Country, 1991 Butler Publishing or brownie who is under a spell from which he can only be released by being given a gift. His mischief is intended to draw attention to himself in the hope that he will be saved. He sings the following song, which indicates how long he expects to be enchanted: :Wae's me, wae's me, (\\"Woe is me, woe is me,\\") :The acorn's not yet fallen from the tree, :That's to grow the wood, :That's to make the cradle, :That's to rock the bairn (\\"That will rock the baby\\"), :That's to grow to the man :That's to lay me! (\\"That will exorcise me!\\") This song is included in the tales where he is laid by the gift of clothing; as a prediction, the song is inaccurate.

During his long reign, he helped his father conquer many territories and maintained the Chola authority over most of Lanka, Vengi, Kalinga, etc. and the relations with overseas domains despite a series of revolts in the territory. Rajadhiraja Chola‚Äôs record shows that he was a born fighter who was very capable of maintaining a vast and expansive empire with territories even outside the shores of India. He was a great warrior who always led his soldiers from the front. His life is a testimony to a great king who fought his own wars, standing shoulder to shoulder with his men on front lines. He earned the title Jayamkonda Chola (The Victorious Cholan) after numerous victories. Towards the end of his reign, he sacked the Western Chalukyan capital Kalyanapuram and assumed the title Kalyanapuramgonda Chola and performed a Virabhisheka (anointment of heroes) under the name Vijaya Rajendra Cholan (the victorious Rajendra Cholan). Long Apprenticeship  Rajadhiraja Chola was made co-regent very early in his reign (1018). From that day onward, father and son ruled together and shared the burdens of the empire. From the inscriptions of Rajadhiraja it is evident that Rajadhiraja ruled in full regal status in the lifetime of his father. Rajadhiraja was at the forefront of most of his father's military campaigns. Military CampaignsRevolts in Lanka= The Buddhist text Mahavamsa shows that the years following the defeat and deportation of the Sinhalese king Mahinda V by Rajendra in 1017 CE were filled with revolt and anarchy due uprisings by the Sinhalese subjects against the reign of the Chola invaders. Mahinda was captured and transported to the Chola country as prisoner where he died 12 years later. Mahinda‚Äôs son Kassapa had formed the resistance against the Chola occupiers and the revolts were centred on Kassapa.See Sastri, KAN, A History of South India, p165 Kassapa managed to face off the almost 95,000 strong Chola army for over six months and push them northwards from the Rohana area in southern Sri Lanka he then crowned himself Vikramabahu in 1029 C.E. Cholas never intended to subjugate the entire island of Sri Lanka and only occupied the whole island for a period of about 10 years. Sinhalese resistance was assisted by various Pandyan princes against their common enemy. Pandyas had a very close political as well as marital relationship with the Sinhalese. During Rajadhiraja‚Äôs reign this became very acute as Vikramabahu launched an all out attack on the Tamil armies to expel them from the island. He was assisted by a Pandya prince Vikarama Pandya and Jagatpala, a prince from the distant Kanauj in North India. Rajadhiraja‚Äôs forces battled and killed these princes.See Sastri, KAN, A History of South India, p167 The version of the Mahavamsa has to be taken in the right perspective in that it states itself to be a Buddhist chronicle and its point of view is only supposed to favour Buddhist subjects. We cannot expect it to speak in very complimentary terms about non-Buddhist kings. In any case, at least in war, the Cholas were known to be very uncompromising with their enemies and believed in eliminating them rather than setting them free. whether it was the \\"Chalukyas\\", \\"Pandyas\\" or the \\"Ilangai kings\\"... their treatment was the same, which the Mahavamsa chroniclers found inhuman.What is valourous and uncompromising warfare on the part of the Cholas was described as brutal conduct when it came to describing defeats of the rulers of Eelam (Sri Lanka). The same Mahavamsa records however, prefer not to throw any light on the looting and killing of traders and businessmen from South India visiting the Island of Ilangai or even other prosperous Tamils coming to see their relations in the Island. Either the traders or ordinary citizens from Tamil country were being regularly waylaid or looted merely because the Sinhalese could not tolerate their presence in the island. The Chola kings particularly from the time of Rajendra Chola I, on coming to know of the ill-treatment meted out to the visitors from Tamil country in Ilangai, took prompt measures to punish the wrong-doers among the local Sinhalese in Ilangai, which information is available in scores of Tamil records[**]. The Chola provinces in Lanka were a separate administrative division of the empire. The deep southern half was however a Sinhalese stronghold in perpetual conflict with the Cholas. Prince Kitti, son of Vikramabahu became Vijayabahu in 1058 CE and took over the leadership of the resistance. The victorious generals of Cholas executed the captured lankan generals along with their family members, mainly in return for their disrupting traders activities from South India in the Lankan mainland by looting and killing them for their riches.See Mendis, GC, p53 =Continuing Chalukya Wars= Rajadhiraja, eager to subdue the rising power of the Western Chalukyas and to restore Chola influence with the Eastern Chalukyas in Vengi, personally led an expedition into the Telugu country in 1046 CE.Indian History by Reddy p.56 He defeated the Western Chalukya forces in a battle at Dannada on the river Krishna and set fire to their fort.See Sastri, KAN, A History of South India, p168 This expedition was followed by number of raids into the Chalukya country by the Chola army in which they captured several generals and feudatories of Chalukya, demolished the Chalukya palace at Kampali. The victorious Chola forces crossed the Krishna river and erected a victory pillar at a place called Yetagiri. After more fighting, Kalyani, the capital of Chalukya, which is identified as Kalyan or Basavakalyan in Bidar was sacked. Cholas also placed a victory pillar in Kolhapur or Kollapuram in Maharashtra.The victorious Rajadhiraja entered the capital of the vanquished Chalukyas and his coronation was performed at 'Kalyanapura', subsequent to which he assumed the title Vijayarajendra.Inscriptions in the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram records that a Dwarapala sculpture from Kalyanapura was brought to the temple by Rajadhiraja after his capture of the capital of the Chalukyas. See P.V. Jagadisa Ayyar, p 353See Richard Davis, p 51 Someshvara I was banished to places like Rodda, Kadambalige and Kogali 1000 territories in the Nolambavadi areas[**]. In 1050 CE Chalukya king Someshvara reneged on his payment of tribute to his Chola overlords and usurped the Chalukya throne from the Chola viceroy in Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan). He also sent an expedition to Vengi in order to re-inforce Western Chalukyan hegemony over the Eastern Chalukyas, whom they always regarded as their dominions. It is also speculated that Someshvara I 'may' have captured Kanchi and Kalinga. However, according to Nilakanta Sastri and Majumdar, these are baseless claims because Someshvara I had as his feudatories the Uchangi Pandyas and the Nolamba Pallavas who had provided shelter to his predecessors Jayasimha-II and Satyashraya. The Nolamba Pallavas pompously held the birudas 'Lord of Kanchi', which may lead one to believe that the feudatories of the Chalukyas were ruling from Kanchi or occupying Kanchipuram, both of which presumptions are false. Also, the Cholas were controlling Kalinga through the Vengi Kings like Vimaladitya and Raja Raja Narendra who were related to the Chola Kings. While Someshvara-I did destabilise Vengi by temporarily displacing Rajaraja Narendra, this act also initially disturbed Chola connections with Kalinga. This however, was short- lived for immediately Rajadhiraja-I set off for war against Someshvara-I and that too not at Vengi or Kalinga but by the Chalukya capital itself. But that was after thoroughly preparing himself for war before which he undertook in 1052, the task of anointing his younger brother Rajendra Chola II as co-regent in preference to his own sons. The latter seems to have ascended the throne in 12th for he has the title Rajakesari from then on. When these tasks were completed, in 1054 Rajadhiraja invaded the Chalukyan territory[**]. Rajadhiraja invaded Rattamandalam (southern Karnataka) and immediately seized many of the southern parts of Chalukyan territory like Uchangi, Nulambavadi, Kadambalige, Kogali etc. These developments shook Someshvara-I, who had given himself the title of Trailokyamalla after installing his puppet in Vengi and he had to rush back to save his own kingdom and he had no option but to march against the marauding Chola armies. The two armies met at a place called Koppam on the banks of the Krishna River[**]. =Inscriptions= Rajadhiraja's inscriptions begin with the introduction tingaler-taru. The following is an inscription from the Svetaranyesvara temple in Tiruvenkadu, a few miles from Vaitheeswaran temple. It mentions the king's father, Another inscription of the king from a temple in Chingleput district is as follows, From an inscription from the 29th year of his reign from the Rajagopala Perumal temple we understand that he defeated several warriors of the Chalukyan army, the most notable being Vikki (Vikramaditya), Vijayadityan and Sangamayan. In addition, it also shows the various kingdoms that acknowledged his supremacy. Here is an excerpt: Here is an excerpt of an inscription from the Chikballapur district of Karnataka. It gives a brief overview of some of the king's exploits while he was still a co-regent of his predecessor (original in Tamil and Grantha alphabet): Here is the inscription from Kolar in Karnataka: Sometime after he ascended the throne, he placed Rajendra Chola II as a co- regent. Rajendra Chola II would reign alongside Rajadhiraja until the latter's death after which he ascended the throne. Death on the Battlefield He was one of the greatest and bravest warriors in the Chola dynasty and sadly perished alone in a northern battlefield (Battle of Koppam). From the manner of his death, Rajadhiraja came to be known as Yanai-mel-thunjina Devar (the king who died on the back of an elephant). From the time he was chosen heir- apparent by his father to the day when he laid down his life on the field of battle, Rajadhiraja led the life of a warrior king and led many campaigns in person. Rajadhiraja was first and foremost a soldier and possibly his great military talent formed the reason for his being preferred for succession against an elder brother of his. Personal life Rajadhiraja employed his father‚Äôs brother, his own brothers, elder and younger, in important offices of state and constituted them into subordinate rulers of regions of his empire. We know of the title (Trilokyam Udaiyar) rather than the actual name of a queen. His queens do not figure prominently in his records. Apart from Vijaya Rajendra, he took the titles of Virarajendra Varman, Ahavamally Kulantaka and Kalyanapurangondachola. His children seem to have been overlooked in the succession to the Chola throne for a brief time. Officials Vira- Vichchadira(Vidyadhara)-Muvendavelan was a prominent military officer of this king. He has made several generous donations to the various temples in Kalavara nadu, a sub-division of Nigarili-Chola-mandalam (part of present-day Karnataka) where he was deployed. Vettan Panachanadi-VƒÅnan alias MadurƒÅntaka- tTamil-pperaiyan of TandƒÅngurai in VilƒÅnƒÅdu belonging to the Pandikulasani valanadu of Sola-mandalam was the overseer of the dandanayakas.Epigraphia Carnatica, Volume 10, Part 1, page 35 Santi Kuttan Tiruvalan Tirumud Kunran alias Vijaya Rajendra Acharyan, an actor was in charge of the troupe that were responsible for enacting the Rajarajeswara Natakam (a musical), in the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Thanjavur.Bharatanatyam, the Tamil heritage, page 42Middle Chola temples: Rajaraja I to Kulottunga I (A.D. 985‚Äì1070), page 266 Velala Madurantakam alias Dandanayakan Rajadhiraja Ilangovelan was another officer from Nadar, a village of Tiraimur-nadu which was a sub-division of Uyyakondan-valanadu in Sola-mandalam. He has donated 90 sheep to a temple in Tiruvorriyur during the 3rd year of the reign of Rajendra Chola II when the latter was still a co-regent of the king.South Indian shrines: illustrated, page 53  Religion  The Shaiva Siddhanta school of thought was prevalent and the Bhakti poetry of the Nayanars were encouraged and sang in the temples. We have a record dated in the twenty eighth year of the king's reign from the Adhipurisvara temple in Tiruvorriyur which mentions the Tiruttondatogai of Sundarar and the names of the sixty three Nayanars.

They distribute their music over the internet for free. History Planet Gemini was formed in 1997 by vocalist and guitarist Hellion and bassist Josh in Boston, Massachusetts. The band's first \\"official\\" release, 13, was made available for download on July 13, 2002 along with album artwork, inlay art and CD label art for their fans to print up themselves. The band's second release, Cauldron of Fuzz, was recorded from leftovers from 13 and was originally slated to be an EP. The original plan was for them to go into the studio and record all night to put three new songs onto the EP for their own collection. They wrote five songs the first night and followed it up the next weekend. Without any sleep they improvised another whole album, and continued the tradition of writing the Cauldron of Fuzz albums under heavy sleep deprivation. Post-Josh In July 2006, Josh decided to part ways with the Planet Gemini project, causing Hellion to continue the band on his own. Now a one-man project Planet Gemini's album \\"Legacy\\" has been canceled (because the album was supposed to celebrate 10 years of H & Josh's music). On October 31, 2006, Hellion released Cauldron of Fuzz IV: The Finale, for download on the band's official webpage. It was a collection of all unfinished demos and he and Josh worked on. This album will never be completed out of respect for the previous band member. On October 31, 2007, Hellion released Cauldron of Fuzz V: Sometimes it Comes Back, available for free download via the band's official webpage. Other Planet Gemini collaborators Hellion has worked with Jeff \\"Oly\\" Olson of the Chicago-based Doom Metal band Trouble. On a project that was tentatively entitled \\"The HOLY Project\\". Hellion also collaborated with Vinny Appice in 2006, which never got released due to Josh leaving the band. Hellion is also working on a side project called \\"Loomis\\" that he has talked little about on his webpage which consists of four local musicians Dan Jagoda (drums), Greg Furious (bass), Jeff Saude (guitar), Hellion (guitar, vocals). Hellion stated on his webpage that he would have demos available as soon as they are written on his official webpage. Musical style Planet Gemini produced a much more groove oriented doom metal. Influences include Black Sabbath, Trouble, Candlemass, and other doom metal bands.

This standard is set by the two government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and sets the limit on the maximum value of any individual mortgage they will purchase from a lender. Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) are large agencies that purchase the bulk of U.S. residential mortgages from banks and other lenders, allowing them to free up liquidity to lend more mortgages. When FNMA and FHLMC limits don't cover the full loan amount, the loan is referred to as a \\"jumbo mortgage\\". Traditionally, the interest rates on jumbo mortgages are higher than for conforming mortgages, however with GSE fees increasing, Jumbo loans have recently seen lower interest rates than conforming loans. History On February 13, 2008, President George W. Bush signed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (), which temporarily increased the jumbo conforming limit in the United States. The limit was raised to $729,750 or 125% of the median home value within the metropolitan statistical area, whichever is the lesser.Full Text of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 Initially due to expire in December 2008, the new limits were extended through 2010.Confirmation of Conforming Loan Limits for 2010 - Fannie Mae, November 12, 2009 Mortgage lenders did not freely adopt these new limits, making them essentially \\"theoretical,\\" as mortgages above the old conforming limit of $417,000 still attracted higher interest rates. , the limit on a conforming loan in \\"general\\" areas was $417,000 for most of the US, apart from Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the limit was $625,500. The limit in \\"high cost\\" areas was $729,750 and $938,250, respectively. On October 1, 2011, the jumbo conforming limit of $729,750 in \\"high cost\\" areas was reduced to $625,500. On November 28, 2017, the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced that the ceiling loan limit for one-unit properties in most high-cost areas will be $679,650 ‚Äî or 150 percent of $453,100. Risk Jumbo mortgage loans are a higher risk for lenders, mainly due to their larger size rather than credit quality. This is because if a jumbo mortgage loan defaults, it may be harder to sell a luxury residence quickly for full price. Luxury prices are more vulnerable to market highs and lows in some cases. That is one reason lenders prefer to have a higher down payment from jumbo loan seekers. Jumbo home prices can be more subjective and not as easily sold to a mainstream borrower, therefore many lenders may require two appraisals on a jumbo mortgage loan. Costs The interest rate charged on jumbo mortgage loans is generally higher than a loan that is conforming, due to the higher risk to the lender. The spread, or difference between the two rates, depends on the current market price of risk. While typically the spread fluctuates between 0.25 and 0.5%, at times of high investor anxiety, such as August 2007, it can exceed one and a half percentage points. It can be more expensive to refinance a jumbo loan due to the closing costs. Some lenders will offer the service of an extension and consolidation agreement, so that a jumbo refinancer will not have to pay for mortgage tax again on the same principal balance. In other cases, title insurance companies will offer up to a 50% discount, often required by law for those refinancing within 1 year to 10 years. The largest discount is for refinancing within one year. Role in US housing bubble As house prices rose as part of the United States housing bubble, there was a large increase in the number of jumbo loan applicants. Due to rising prices, many consumers had to take out jumbo mortgages in order to buy modest homes in big-city areas; this option was no longer limited to high- end luxury residences. Many of these new loans were 40- or 50-year amortization, or had an interest-only option, similar to subprime loans. That meant that the jumbo loan borrower would pay the loan back over a longer period of time, or could defer any repayment of principal for a few years (thereby also increasing the total amount to be paid back). However from 2007, as prices fell and the number of foreclosures rose, lenders turned away from providing jumbo mortgages.Home buyers find it's harder to get jumbo loans amid credit crunch San Francisco Chronicle, August 17, 2007 Lenders that did remain in the jumbo loan market increased rates sharply, with rates up to 1.5 percentage points higher than for conforming loans.Calif. home sales plunge in January Forbes.com, February 14, 2008 This withdrawal from the market led to a lack of lending available to fund the purchases of expensive homes, thus putting further downward pressure on house prices and completing a vicious circle.Many Lenders Making Jumbo Loans Have Demanded Higher Rates Gainesville Sun, September 6, 2007 The delinquency rate on jumbo loans rose dramatically, tripling over the course of 2009, and by February 2010, almost one in ten jumbo mortgages were 'seriously delinquent' (i.e. in arrears by at least 60 days).Jumbo Mortgage ‚ÄòSerious Delinquencies‚Äô Rise to 9.6% - Bloomberg.com, February 8, 2010 ReferencesExternal links * [https://ww..org/nbr/site//transcriptsjumbo_mortgag_100512/ The Jumb Mortgage Business is Growing - PBSNightly Business Report with Susie Ghari \\\\- May 12, 2010. * \\"Jumbo Loans Easier To Find\\" - The Wall Street Journal - April 30, 2010, Article Headline: \\"Jumbo Loans Easier to Find\\" - The Wall Street Journal *New Loan Changes Bring No Relief‚Äîretrieved Apr 13 2008 *Housing & Lender Information *Fannie Mae Loan Limits *Jumbo Loans Now Have Lower Down-payments Requirements Category:Mortgage industry of the United States ","title":"Jumbo mortgage"},{"id":"2473380","text":"The subiculum (Latin for \\"support\\") is the most inferior component of the hippocampal formation. It lies between the entorhinal cortex and the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus proper. The subicular complex comprises a set of related structures including (as well as subiculum proper) prosubiculum, presubiculum, postsubiculum and parasubiculum. Name The Subiculum got its name from Karl Friedrich Burdach in his three-volume work Vom Bau und Leben des Gehirns (Vol. 2, ¬ß199). He originally named it subiculum cornu ammonis and so associated it with the rest of the hippocampal subfields. Structure It receives input from CA1 and entorhinal cortical layer III pyramidal neurons and is the main output of the hippocampus. The pyramidal neurons send projections to the nucleus accumbens, septal nuclei, prefrontal cortex, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus reuniens, mammillary nuclei, entorhinal cortex and amygdala. The pyramidal neurons in the subiculum exhibit transitions between two modes of action potential output: bursting and single spiking.Donald C. Cooper, Sungkwon Chung, Nelson Spruston, \\"Output-Mode Transitions Are Controlled by Prolonged Inactivation of Sodium Channels in Pyramidal Neurons of Subiculum,\\" PLoS Biology, 3(6):e175, 2005 June. The transitions between these two modes is thought to be important for routing information out of the hippocampus. Four component areas have been described:http://atlas.brain-map.org parasubiculum (adjacent to the parahippocampal gyrus), presubiculum, postsubiculum, and prosubiculum. = Parasubiculum = The parasubiculum contains grid cells, which are neurons responsive to movements in particular directions over particular distances. = Presubiculum = The presubiculum is part of the posterior cortex corresponding to Brodmann's area 27, and forms part of the cortical input to the entorhinal-hippocampal spatial/memory system.  Postsubiculum  The dorsal part of the presubiculum is more commonly known as the postsubiculum and is of interest because it contains head direction cells, which are responsive to the facing direction of the head. = Prosubiculum = Prosubiculum is a term often used in reference to monkey anatomy but rarely in rodents, referring to a region located between the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the subiculum, and distinguished by higher cell density and smaller cell sizes. Function It is believed to play a role in some cases of human epilepsy. It has also been implicated in working memory and drug addiction. It has been suggested that the dorsal subiculum is involved in spatial relations, and the ventral subiculum regulates the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis. Clinical significancePotential role in Alzheimer's disease= Rat studies indicate that lesioning of the subiculum decreases the spread of amyloid-beta in rat models of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease pathology is thought to have prion-like properties. The disease tends to spread in characteristic sequence from the entorhinal cortex through the subiculum.

Prior to his spell in Hertfordshire, Langley played for Thai Premier League side Pattaya United before leaving them at the turn of the year. He has previously played for Queens Park Rangers (during two spells), Cardiff City and Luton Town and has been capped by Jamaica. Club career Born in Harlesden, London, Langley rose through the youth system at Queens Park Rangers, signing a professional contract in 1996. One of the highlights of his career at QPR was scoring a hat-trick in an away win over Blackpool in March 2003. After a trial with Crystal Palace, he signed for Cardiff City in 2003 for an initial fee of ¬£200,000 rising to around ¬£250,000 on appearances. He returned to QPR in August 2005, but was not given a contract extension. He joined Luton on a free transfer a year later, and wore the number 17 shirt for the 2006‚Äì07 season. He scored his first and what turned out to be only Luton goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Stoke City on 19 August 2006. Langley damaged his cruciate knee ligaments in a pre-season friendly in 2007 and missed almost the entire 2007‚Äì08 season, making a solitary appearance in the final game of the season.

Decree of Dionysopolis  This decree was written by the citizens of Dionysopolis to Akornion, who traveled far away in a diplomatic mission to meet somebody's father in Argedauon. The inscription also refers to the Dacian king Burebista, and one interpretation is that Akornion was his chief adviser (, literally \\"first friend\\") in Dionysopolis. Other sources indicate that Akornion was sent as an ambassador of Burebista to Pompey, to discuss an alliance against Julius Caesar. This leads to the assumption that the mentioned Argedava was Burebista's capital of the Dacian kingdom. This source unfortunately doesn't mention the location of Argedava and historians opinions are split in two groups. One school of thought, led by historians Constantin Daicoviciu and Hadrian Daicoviciu, assumes that the inscription talks about Argidava and place the potential capital of Burebista at VƒÉrƒÉdia, Cara≈ü-Severin County, Romania. The forms Argidava and Arcidava found in other ancient sources like Ptolemy's Geographia (c. 150 AD) and Tabula Peutingeriana (2nd century AD), clearly place a Dacian town with those names at this geographical location. The site is also close to Sarmizegetusa, a later Dacian capital. Others, led by historian Vasile P√¢rvan and professor Radu Vulpe place Argedava at Pope≈üti, Giurgiu County, Romania. Arguments include the name connection with the Arge≈ü River, geographical position on a potential road to Dionysopolis which Akornion followed, and most importantly the size of the archaeological discovery at Pope≈üti that hints to a royal palace. However no other sources seem to name the dava discovered at Pope≈üti, so no exact assumptions can be made about its Dacian name. It is possible that the two different davae are homonyms. The marble inscription is damaged in many areas, including right before the word Argedauon, and it is possible the original word could have been Sargedauon () or Zargedauon. This form could be linked to Zargidaua mentioned by Ptolemy at a different geographical location. Or, they could be homonyms. The decree, a fragmentary marble inscription, is located in the National Museum in Sofia.

The region plays an important role in memory encoding and retrieval. It has been involved in some cases of hippocampal sclerosis. Asymmetry has been observed in schizophrenia. Structure The anterior part of the gyrus includes the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices. The term parahippocampal cortex is used to refer to an area that encompasses both the posterior parahippocampal gyrus and the medial portion of the fusiform gyrus. FunctionScene recognition= The parahippocampal place area (PPA) is a sub-region of the parahippocampal cortex that lies medially in the inferior temporo-occipital cortex. PPA plays an important role in the encoding and recognition of environmental scenes (rather than faces). fMRI studies indicate that this region of the brain becomes highly active when human subjects view topographical scene stimuli such as images of landscapes, cityscapes, or rooms (i.e. images of \\"places\\"). Furthermore, according to work by Pierre M√©gevand et al. in 2014, stimulation of the region via intracranial electrodes yields intense topographical visual hallucinations of places and situations. The region was first described by Russell Epstein and Nancy Kanwisher in 1998 at MIT, see also other similar reports by Geoffrey Aguirre and Alumit Ishai. Damage to the PPA (for example, due to stroke) often leads to a syndrome in which patients cannot visually recognize scenes even though they can recognize the individual objects in the scenes (such as people, furniture, etc.). The PPA is often considered the complement of the fusiform face area (FFA), a nearby cortical region that responds strongly whenever faces are viewed, and that is believed to be important for face recognition. =Social context= Additional research has suggested that the right parahippocampal gyrus in particular has functions beyond the contextualizing of visual background. Tests by a California-based group led by Katherine P. Rankin indicate that the lobe may play a crucial role in identifying social context as well, including paralinguistic elements of verbal communication. For example, Rankin's research suggests that the right parahippocampal gyrus enables people to detect sarcasm. Additional images File:Parahippocampal gyrus animation.gifAnimation.

(n√©e Sim; 5 June 1922 ‚Äì 19 January 2016), known professionally by her maiden name Sheila Sim, was an English film and theatre actress. She was the wife of the actor, director and peer Richard Attenborough. Career Sheila Beryl Grant Sim was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, only daughter of banker Stuart Grant Sim (1893-1975) and his wife Ida Isabel Carter (married in April 1920). Brought up at \\"Carnlea\\" overlooking Calderstones Park in Liverpool and later, 18 The Ridge at Purley in Surrey, Sim was privately educated before training at RADA. Sim was mainly active as an actress in the 1940s and 1950s. She appeared in the Powell and Pressburger film, A Canterbury Tale (1944); she acted alongside her husband in the Boulting brothers' The Guinea Pig (1948); and starred opposite Anthony Steel in West of Zanzibar (1954). In theatre, she co-starred with her husband, Richard Attenborough, in the first cast of The Mousetrap by Agatha Christie, from its London premiere in 1952. Sim played the role of Mollie Ralston. After recruitment by No√´l Coward, Sim actively served the Actors' Charitable Trust for more than 60 years. She was instrumental in the success of two redevelopments of the actors' care home, Denville Hall, in the 1960s and 2000s, and was a Trustee and Vice-President of the charities. Sim was a significant benefactor to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), where she originally trained; her husband was RADA's president from 2003 until he died in 2014. Family Sim married Richard Attenborough on 22 January 1945 and they had lived in a house on Richmond Green in London from 1956 until 2012, when her husband placed it for sale at ¬£11.5 million. The couple had three children, Michael (born 13 February 1950), Jane (30 September 1955 ‚Äì 26 December 2004), and Charlotte (born 29 June 1959). Jane, along with her 15-year-old daughter, Lucy, and her mother-in-law, also named Jane, were killed in the Indian Ocean tsunami as it struck their villa on the coast of Thailand on 26 December 2004. Michael and Charlotte are both involved in the dramatic professions: he as a director, she as an actress. Sim's younger brother, Gerald, who died on 11 December 2014, was also an actor. Richard Attenborough died on 24 August 2014. Sim and Attenborough had been married for 69 years. Ill health and death In June 2012, shortly before her 90th birthday, Sim entered the actors' retirement home Denville Hall, for which she and her husband had helped raise funds. In July 2012, while her husband Richard had been battling health issues in recent years, it was announced that Sim had been diagnosed with senile dementia. In March 2013 in the light of his deteriorating health, Richard Attenborough moved into Denville Hall to be with his wife, confirmed by their son Michael. Her younger brother Gerald likewise lived in Denville Hall until his death in December 2014. Her death was announced on 19 January 2016. Sim was cremated and her ashes were interred in a vault at St Mary Magdalene church in Richmond beside those of her husband, daughter Jane Holland and her granddaughter, Lucy, both of whom had died in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.

The highest peak is Peleaga (V√¢rful Peleaga), at an altitude of . Other important peaks are PƒÉpu»ôa (V√¢rful PƒÉpu»ôa, \\"the Doll Peak\\") and Retezat Peak (V√¢rful Retezat). The name means \\"cut off\\" in Romanian. View over Lake Bucura from Peleaga Peak - photo by Daniel Ighisan Geography The Retezat Mountains have many glacial lakes, including the largest glacial lake in Romania, Bucura Lake (Lacul Bucura), which covers and is situated at an altitude of . The area also contains the Retezat National Park, Romania's first national park. thumb thumb River systems and lakes The tectonic, lithologic and morphologic conditions present in the Retezat mountains, correlated with the orientation of the ridges towards the main air masses make this mountain group the most humid area in the Romanian Carpathians. The hydrologic network is divided into two main directions: north, towards the river Strei (the Mure»ô drainage basin) where all the rivers from the west, north and north-east areas of the massif are flowing and south, towards the river Jiul de Vest (the Jiu drainage basin). The most important river course is R√¢ul Mare with an annual average flow of 12.9 m3/s. Waterfalls are present on all water courses in the park. One of the specific features of the Retezat mountains is the widespread presence of glacier lakes. Approximately 38% of the glacier lakes of Romania are found here, on the bottom of calderas, grouped in lake clusters or isolated, and are one of the biggest tourist attraction of the park. Within the massiff limits, there are 58 permanent glacier lakes, between 1700 m and 2300 m. Some sources mention over 80 lakes, but here are most likely included the temporary ones as well. The surface of the lakes varies between 300 m2 (St√¢ni»ôoara I) and 88612 m2 (Bucura), the largest glacier lake in Romania. The depth of the lakes varies between 0.3m (St√¢ni»ôoara I) and 29 m (ZƒÉnoaga), while the volume is between 90.3 m3 (Gale»ôul II) and 693.152 m3 (ZƒÉnoaga). Flora Of the approximately 3500 plant species that are found in Romania, over a third (about 1200) can be found here. This is mainly the reason why this area was declared a National park. There are over 90 plant species that are endemic to this area, the first one being discovered in 1858: FlƒÉm√¢nzica (Draba dorneri). The alpine meadows are particularly important, as here are found most of the alpine species, such as members of the genera Gentiana, Potentilla and Pulsatilla. The edelweiss can also be found here. At the limits between the rocky area and the alpine fields, species of rhododendron (Rhododendron kotschii) can be found. The mountain pine, a protected species in Romania, can be found on all the steep slopes of the Retezat mountains, while the Swiss pine (Pinus cembra) has a wider distribution than in any other Romanian massif. Other species that can be found here are: hawkweed (Hieracium borzae and Hieracium nigrilacus), members of the genus Centaurea (Centaurea pseudophrygia ratezatensis, an endemic species), cat's ear (Hypochaeris maculata), an endemic species of locoweed (Oxytropis jacquinii retezatensis) and Gentiana lutea (ro. Ghin≈£ura galbenƒÉ). On the calcareous areas of the Small Retezat, a lot of rare or endemic species can be found, like Barbarea lepuznica (a species of the winter cress genus) or Pedicularis baumgarteni, a species of the genus Pedicularis. The biggest threat for the park's flora (especially the one found on the alpine fields), is overgrazing, as there are numerous herds of sheep. The species specific to this area are replaced by less fragile ones. Fauna thumb Over 185 species of birds, more than half of the species that can be found in Romania, visit the park. Out of these, over 122 species nest here. Rare birds, such as the golden eagle, (also represented on the park logo), lesser spotted eagle, short-toed eagle, peregrine falcon, western capercaillie, Eurasian eagle-owl, Eurasian pygmy-owl and the black stork reside here. There are 55 species of mammals within the park range. There are favorable conditions here for some of Europe's biggest predators to survive: the gray wolf, brown bear and the Eurasian lynx; some big herbivores like the chamois, red deer and the roe deer, while small carnivores such as the wildcat and the European otter can also be found. In 1973, 20 alpine marmots, brought from the Austrian Alps, were introduced in the park and released in the Gemenele glacier lake caldera. Nowadays they are found all over the park, but the impact that this nonindigenous species had on other plants or animals is yet unknown. Also, after 1960, the brown trout was introduced in some of the park lakes. Studies are now being performed to check if they are responsible for the decline in amphibian population through these lakes, observed during the last years. A subspecies of the smooth newt (L. vulgaris ampelensis), endemic to the Charpatian mountains, lives here, while the European common frog can be fould all over the park. Although very few common European viper bites were reported, tourists and villagers often kill them on sight. There are several endemic invertebrate species found here: nine endemic species of butterflies, at least six species belonging to the Plecoptera order, and four belonging to the Trichoptera order. Judele peak seen from Retezat peak, across Gemenele‚ÄìTƒÉu Negru Reservation Access South Retezat Region = The southern approaches to the Retezat extend from the Jiu Valley city of Vulcan on the east end of the valley to C√¢mpu»ôel on the west end of the valley. Although there are several points of entry into the Retezat Mountains from the towns of Vulcan, Lupeni, Uricani, C√¢mpul lui Neag, and points in between, direct access to the National Park begins in the Cheile Bu»õii area (approximately 35 km west of Petro»ôani) and extends west to C√¢mpu»ôel. =North Retezat Region= The Retezat Mountains and Retezat National Park are accessible from the North by way of Romania's Route 66 (DN-66) and/or by way of train, which runs alongside Route 66, from Petro»ôani to the southeast or Simeria to the North. From Route 66, there are several gateways into the Retezat Mountains. Almost all the villages along the highway, from Ohaba de sub PiatrƒÉ, just outside Ha»õeg, to Meri»ôor, just outside Petro»ôani, have access roads that run south into the Retezat Mountains.

On March 21, 2013 party leader Shozaburo Jimi announced that he was disbanding the party. History The Kokumin Shinto, originally headed by Shizuka Kamei, included former lower house speaker Tamisuke Watanuki, former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lower house members Hisaoki Kamei, Tadahiro Matsushita, and House of Councillors members Kensei Hasegawa from the LDP and Tamura Hideaki from the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the main opposition. Most of the members of the Kokumin Shinto were formerly members of the Shisuikai (also known as Kamei Faction) of the LDP. Their strong links to the postal lobby forced them to go against Koizumi's plans to privatise the postal system. While Watanuki was made party leader, Kamei was also seen as a public face for the party. The party was initially almost exclusively defined by its opposition to Koizumi's politics as expressed in the post privatisation debate. Eventually their platform was broadened to include ideals of serving and protecting the people, and engaging in \\"warm, friendly politics\\". In the 2005 snap election, the party was able to retain four seats, matching the pre-election total, with two single-seat members (Watanuki and Shizuka Kamei) and two proportional members (Hisaoki Kamei and new member Masaki Itokawa). However, the overwhelming victory of the LDP, with a new two-thirds majority in the lower house, made it unlikely that they would be able to exert influence on government policy. In June 2007, party head Shizuka Kamei announced that Alberto Fujimori would be running for a seat in the House of Councillors under the banner of the People's New Party. At the time of the initial announcement, Fujimori was under house arrest in Chile pending the outcome of an extradition hearing to decide whether he would be returned to Peru to face charges of corruption and human rights violations there. On 11 July 2007 Chilean Judge Orlando Alvarez ruled against the extradition; however, Fujimori remained under house arrest, and was unable to return to Japan for his campaign. He would ultimately fail in his bid. After the 2009 general election, on 16 September 2009, a new government was formed; the PNP became a part of the ruling coalition led by the DPJ.http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090916p2a00m0na033000c.html After that the party suffered in the next Councillor election and general election.

In particular, the explained sum of squares measures how much variation there is in the modelled values and this is compared to the total sum of squares ( TSS ), which measures how much variation there is in the observed data, and to the residual sum of squares, which measures the variation in the error between the observed data and modelled values. Definition The explained sum of squares (ESS) is the sum of the squares of the deviations of the predicted values from the mean value of a response variable, in a standard regression model ‚Äî for example, , where yi is the i th observation of the response variable, xji is the i th observation of the j th explanatory variable, a and bj are coefficients, i indexes the observations from 1 to n, and Œµi is the i th value of the error term.

The explained sum of squares, defined as the sum of squared deviations of the predicted values from the observed mean of y, is : ESS = (\\\\hat y - \\\\bar y)^T(\\\\hat y - \\\\bar y) = \\\\hat y^T \\\\hat y - 2\\\\hat y^T \\\\bar y + \\\\bar y ^T \\\\bar y. Using \\\\hat y = X \\\\hat \\\\beta in this, and simplifying to obtain \\\\hat y^T \\\\hat y = y^TX(X^T X)^{-1}X^Ty , gives the result that TSS = ESS + RSS if and only if y^T \\\\bar y = \\\\hat y^T \\\\bar y. The left side of this is y_m times the sum of the elements of y, and the right side is y_m times the sum of the elements of \\\\hat y, so the condition is that the sum of the elements of y equals the sum of the elements of \\\\hat y, or equivalently that the sum of the prediction errors (residuals) y_i - \\\\hat y_i is zero. This can be seen to be true by noting the well-known OLS property that the k √ó 1 vector X^T \\\\hat e = X^T [I - X(X^T X)^{-1}X^T]y= 0: since the first column of X is a vector of ones, the first element of this vector X^T \\\\hat e is the sum of the residuals and is equal to zero. This proves that the condition holds for the result that TSS = ESS + RSS. In linear algebra terms, we have RSS = \\\\y - {\\\\hat y}\\\\^2 , TSS = \\\\y - \\\\bar y\\\\^2, ESS = \\\\{\\\\hat y} - \\\\bar y\\\\^2 . The proof can be simplified by noting that y^T {\\\\hat y} = {\\\\hat y}^T {\\\\hat y} . The proof is as follows: : {\\\\hat y}^T {\\\\hat y} = y^T X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y = y^T X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y = y^T {\\\\hat y}, Thus, : \\\\begin{align} TSS & = \\\\y - \\\\bar y\\\\^2 = \\\\y - {\\\\hat y} + {\\\\hat y} - \\\\bar y\\\\^2  & = \\\\y - {\\\\hat y}\\\\^2 + \\\\{\\\\hat y} - \\\\bar y\\\\^2 + 2  & = RSS + ESS + 2 y^T {\\\\hat y} -2 {\\\\hat y}^T {\\\\hat y} - 2 y^T {\\\\bar y} + 2 {\\\\hat y}^T{\\\\bar y}  & = RSS + ESS - 2 y^T {\\\\bar y} + 2 {\\\\hat y}^T{\\\\bar y} \\\\end{align} which again gives the result that TSS = ESS + RSS, since (y-\\\\hat y)^T \\\\bar y = 0.

It is a \\"heavy modification\\" of the civil GAZ-2330 \\"Tigr\\". Its name comes from the Russian \\"–≤–æ–¥–Ω–∏–∫\\" ‚Äì a person employed in water transport, but is also used to refer to some person or object simply related to water. A better translation would be water bearer as in the astrological sign Aquarius. The Vodnik was not adopted by the Russian Armed Forces. Description This vehicle is amphibious, and uses its wheels to propel itself when afloat. It has a water-displacing hermetic hull which provides improved fording performance and a 4x4-type chassis with independent suspension and a centralized system of tire-pressure control. The ground clearance is 475 mm. The standard undercarriage with a cab can be fitted with a number of different modules with various number of passenger seats and cargo compartments, seating up to 10 people. It is powered by a 175 hp (130 kW) diesel engine giving a top speed of 112 km/h (4 to 5 km/h when swimming). The car is built on a modular scheme. Welded body includes two removable modules. Front module consists of a power department and management, divided sealed bulkhead. The rear multi- module due to the quick release coupling can be replaced in the field. In other words, a single chassis can perform several functions, depending on the installed modules: * transportation of people; * freight handling and processing equipment in remote areas; * transportation of residential units and other utilities modules; * perform the functions of technological machines fuel and energy complex (tankers, containers, etc.). The vehicle has a switchable front wheel drive, independent torsion bar suspension, central tire inflation system, power steering and a powerful system for heating and air conditioning. Armament The Vodnik may be fitted with the same BPU-1 turret, designed in late 1970s, as the BTR-80 on the top of the vehicle towards the rear. The turret is fitted with the 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine gun and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial light machine gun. The main gun is not stabilized (neither in the BTR-80 nor the BTR-80A), so accurate fire on the move is limited (to low speeds), and the rotation mechanism is manually operated. In some cases, it is fitted with a BPPU turret with a 30-mm 2A72 and a PKT. The gunner sits in a roof mounted chair located above the flat floor behind the driver/commander and two passengers, and before the passenger bench. The gunner's station is basic, but uncharacteristically spacious for a Soviet- designed armored vehicle. The gunner is equipped with daytime sight. There are six 902V \\"Tucha\\" 81 mm smoke grenade launchers mounted on the rear of the turret. History The distant ancestor of GAZ-3937 \\"Vodnik\\" is floating car under the symbol NAMI-0281, of which the design begun in 1985. Though, this car had a completely different layout. The compartment of the power unit was located in the rear of the vehicle and the cargo compartment was housed in the middle. This solution made it possible to maintain a trim while afloat, almost regardless of the load. The modern GAZ-3937 has retained almost nothing from its predecessor. NAMI-0281 itself has some resemblance to the BRDM. Versions Vodnik is available in two versions. * GAZ-3937 - the driver and passenger sit one behind the other on the left side of the vehicle and to their right is the power plant. * GAZ-39371 - nose pushed forward for the wheel arches. And the driving compartment seats three: a driver and a passenger - one after the other as before, and the second passenger - the right of the driver.

It converts an input laser wave (called \\"pump\\") with frequency \\\\omega_p into two output waves of lower frequency (\\\\omega_s, \\\\omega_i) by means of second-order nonlinear optical interaction. The sum of the output waves' frequencies is equal to the input wave frequency: \\\\omega_s + \\\\omega_i=\\\\omega_p. For historical reasons, the two output waves are called \\"signal\\" and \\"idler\\", where the output wave with higher frequency is the \\"signal\\". A special case is the degenerate OPO, when the output frequency is one-half the pump frequency, \\\\omega_s=\\\\omega_i=\\\\omega_p/2, which can result in half-harmonic generation when signal and idler have the same polarization. The first optical parametric oscillator was demonstrated by Joseph A. Giordmaine and Robert C. Miller in 1965, five years after the invention of the laser, at Bell Labs. Optical parametric oscillators are used as coherent light sources for various scientific purposes, and to generate squeezed light for quantum mechanics research. A Soviet report was also published in 1965.Akhmanov SA, Kovrigin AI, Piskarskas AS, Fadeev VV, Khokhlov RV, Observation of parametric amplification in the optical range, JETP Letters 2, No.7, 191-193 (1965). Overview The OPO consists essentially of an optical resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical resonator serves to resonate at least one of signal and idler waves. In the nonlinear optical crystal, the pump, signal and idler waves overlap. The interaction between these three waves leads to amplitude gain for signal and idler waves (parametric amplification) and a corresponding deamplification of the pump wave. The gain allows the resonating wave(s) (signal or idler or both) to oscillate in the resonator, compensating the loss that the resonating wave(s) experience(s) at each round-trip. This loss includes the loss due to outcoupling by one of the resonator mirrors, which provides the desired output wave. Since the (relative) loss is independent of the pump power, but the gain is dependent on pump power, at low pump power there is insufficient gain to support oscillation. Only when the pump power reaches a particular threshold level, oscillation occurs. Above threshold, the gain depends also on the amplitude of the resonated wave. Thus, in steady- state operation, the amplitude of the resonated wave is determined by the condition that this gain equals the (constant) loss. The circulating amplitude increases with increasing pump power, and so does the output power. The photon conversion efficiency, the number of output photons per unit time in the output signal or idler wave relative to number of pump photons incident per unit time into the OPO can be high, in the range of tens of percent. Typical threshold pump power is between tens of milliwatts to several watts, depending on losses of the resonator, the frequencies of the interacting light, the intensity in the nonlinear material, and its nonlinearity. Output powers of several watts can be achieved. There exist both continuous-wave and pulsed OPOs. The latter are easier to build, since the high intensity lasts only for a tiny fraction of a second, which damages the nonlinear optical material and the mirrors less than a continuous high intensity. In the optical parametric oscillator the initial idler and signal waves are taken from background waves, which are always present. If the idler wave is given from the outside along with the pump beam, then the process is called difference frequency generation (DFG). This is a more efficient process than optical parametric oscillation, and in principle can be thresholdless. In order to change the output wave frequencies, one can change the pump frequency or the phasematching properties of the nonlinear optical crystal. This latter is accomplished by changing its temperature or orientation or quasi-phasematching period (see below). For fine-tuning one can also change the optical path length of the resonator. In addition, the resonator may contain elements to suppress mode-hops of the resonating wave. This often requires active control of some element of the OPO system. If the nonlinear optical crystal cannot be phase-matched, quasi-phase- matching (QPM) can be employed. This is accomplished by periodically changing the nonlinear optical properties of the crystal, mostly by periodical poling. With a suitable range of periods, output wavelengths from 700 nm to 5000 nm can be generated in periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN). Common pump sources are neodymium lasers at 1.064 ¬µm or 0.532 ¬µm. An important feature of the OPO is the coherence and the spectral width of the generated radiation. When the pump power is significantly above threshold, the two output waves are, to a very good approximation, coherent states (laser-like waves). The linewidth of the resonated wave is very narrow (as low as several kHz). The nonresonated generated wave also exhibits narrow linewidth if a pump wave of narrow linewidth is employed. Narrow-linewidth OPOs are widely used in spectroscopy. Quantum properties of the generated light beams KTP crystals in an OPO The OPO is the physical system most widely used to generate squeezed coherent states and entangled states of light in the continuous variables regime. Many demonstrations of quantum information protocols for continuous variables were realized using OPOs. 5 The downconversion process really occurs in the single photon regime: each pump photon that is annihilated inside the cavity gives rise to a pair of photons in the signal and idler intracavity modes. This leads to a quantum correlation between the intensities of signal and idler fields, so that there is squeezing in the subtraction of intensities, which motivated the name \\"twin beams\\" for the downconverted fields. The highest squeezing level attained to date is 12.7 dB. It turns out that the phases of the twin beams are quantum correlated as well, leading to entanglement, theoretically predicted in 1988. Below threshold, entanglement was measured for the first time in 1992, and in 2005 above threshold. Above threshold, the pump beam depletion makes it sensitive to the quantum phenomena happening inside the crystal. The first measurement of squeezing in the pump field after parametric interaction was done in 1997. It has been recently predicted that all three fields (pump, signal and idler) must be entangled, a prediction which was experimentally demonstrated by the same group. Not only intensity and phase of the twin beams share quantum correlations, but also do their spatial modes. This feature could be used to enhance signal to noise ratio in image systems and hence surpass the standard quantum limit (or the shot noise limit) for imaging. Applications The OPO is being employed nowadays as a source of squeezed light tuned to atomic transitions, in order to study how the atoms interact with squeezed light. It is also recently demonstrated that a degenerate OPO can be used as an all- optical quantum random number generator that does not require post processing.

These facilities were laid out along a wide central artery, known as Kingsway, almost long. Work on the estate began in May 1936, and the first factory opened in the October of that year. The construction, which was undertaken by Wimpey Construction, took several years, and was completed in 1938.White, p. 14 The estate was officially opened by King George VI on 22 February 1939.

The alternative hypothesis is different depending on which version of the test is used, but is usually stationarity or trend-stationarity. It is named after the statisticians David Dickey and Wayne Fuller, who developed the test in 1979. Explanation A simple AR(1) model is : y_{t}=\\\\rho y_{t-1}+u_{t}\\\\, where y_{t} is the variable of interest, t is the time index, \\\\rho is a coefficient, and u_{t} is the error term. A unit root is present if \\\\rho = 1. The model would be non- stationary in this case. The regression model can be written as : \\\\Delta y_{t}=(\\\\rho-1)y_{t-1}+u_{t}=\\\\delta y_{t-1}+ u_{t}\\\\, where \\\\Delta is the first difference operator. This model can be estimated and testing for a unit root is equivalent to testing \\\\delta = 0 (where \\\\delta \\\\equiv \\\\rho - 1). Since the test is done over the residual term rather than raw data, it is not possible to use standard t-distribution to provide critical values. Therefore, this statistic t has a specific distribution simply known as the Dickey‚ÄìFuller table. There are three main versions of the test: 1\\\\. Test for a unit root: :: \\\\Delta y_t =\\\\delta y_{t-1}+u_t \\\\, 2\\\\. Test for a unit root with drift: :: \\\\Delta y_t =a_0+\\\\delta y_{t-1}+u_t \\\\, 3\\\\. Test for a unit root with drift and deterministic time trend: :: \\\\Delta y_t = a_0+a_1t+\\\\delta y_{t-1}+u_t \\\\, Each version of the test has its own critical value which depends on the size of the sample. In each case, the null hypothesis is that there is a unit root, \\\\delta = 0. The tests have low statistical power in that they often cannot distinguish between true unit-root processes (\\\\delta = 0) and near unit-root processes (\\\\delta is close to zero). This is called the \\"near observation equivalence\\" problem. The intuition behind the test is as follows. If the series y is stationary (or trend-stationary), then it has a tendency to return to a constant (or deterministically trending) mean. Therefore, large values will tend to be followed by smaller values (negative changes), and small values by larger values (positive changes). Accordingly, the level of the series will be a significant predictor of next period's change, and will have a negative coefficient. If, on the other hand, the series is integrated, then positive changes and negative changes will occur with probabilities that do not depend on the current level of the series; in a random walk, where you are now does not affect which way you will go next. It is notable that :: \\\\Delta y_t =a_0 + u_t \\\\, may be rewritten as :: y_t = y_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^t u_i + a_0t with a deterministic trend coming from a_0t and a stochastic intercept term coming from y_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^t u_i, resulting in what is referred to as a stochastic trend. There is also an extension of the Dickey‚ÄìFuller (DF) test called the augmented Dickey‚ÄìFuller test (ADF), which removes all the structural effects (autocorrelation) in the time series and then tests using the same procedure. Dealing with uncertainty about including the intercept and deterministic time trend terms Which of the three main versions of the test should be used is not a minor issue. The decision is important for the size of the unit root test (the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of a unit root when there is one) and the power of the unit root test (the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of a unit root when there is not one). Inappropriate exclusion of the intercept or deterministic time trend term leads to bias in the coefficient estimate for Œ¥, leading to the actual size for the unit root test not matching the reported one. If the time trend term is inappropriately excluded with the a_0 term estimated, then the power of the unit root test can be substantially reduced as a trend may be captured through the random-walk with drift model. On the other hand, inappropriate inclusion of the intercept or time trend term reduces the power of the unit root test, and sometimes that reduced power can be substantial. Use of prior knowledge about whether the intercept and deterministic time trend should be included is of course ideal but not always possible. When such prior knowledge is unavailable, various testing strategies (series of ordered tests) have been suggested, e.g. by Dolado, Jenkinson, and Sosvilla-Rivero (1990) and by Enders (2004), often with the ADF extension to remove autocorrelation. Elder and Kennedy (2001) present a simple testing strategy that avoids double and triple testing for the unit root that can occur with other testing strategies, and discusses how to use prior knowledge about the existence or not of long-run growth (or shrinkage) in y. Hacker and Hatemi-J (2010) provide simulation results on these matters, including simulations covering the Enders (2004) and Elder and Kennedy (2001) unit-root testing strategies. Simulation results are presented in Hacker (2010) which indicate that using an information criterion such as the Schwarz information criterion may be useful in determining unit root and trend status within a Dickey‚ÄìFuller framework.

Orekhovo (), often pronounced only as Orekh, is a Russian word which means\\"nut\\". The city was established in 1917 when three villages (Orekhovo, Zuyevo, and Nikolskoye) were merged, hence its name. Population: History The first known facts about what now is Orekhovo-Zuyevo date back to 1209. The place was mentioned in the Moscow Chronicles as the place called \\"Volochok\\" where the battle between Vladimir's prince Yury and Ryazan's prince Izyaslav took place. The name \\"Volochok\\" (or, as it was later called, \\"Zuyev Volochok\\") is derived from the Slavic word for \\"portage\\": a place where wooden ships were carried by land from one river to another. In this place in particular, the ships were usually moved by land between the Klyazma and Nerskaya Rivers. The villages Orekhovo and Zuyevo were mentioned in the chronicle several more times during the Middle Ages. In 1797, serf peasant Savva Vasilievich Morozov () opened his first silk factory in Zuyevo. Later he shifted from silk to wool. In 1823, profits from his business allowed him to be freed from serfdom. In 1830, he moved his factories to the opposite bank of the Klyazma River to the place that was later named Nikolskoye. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, Orekhovo and Zuyevo were the third largest textile production area in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. The first and largest Russian strike occurred in 1885 at Morozov's textile factories in Orekhovo-Zuyevo. Starting on January 7, 1885, at 10 o'clock in the morning, Vasily Volkov raised his hand and a red flag symbolizing victory for the workers and for all to follow him. On the fifth day of the strike, soldiers with their bayonets fixed arrived to arrest the leaders, Volkov and F. Shelukhin, at which time they shouted to their comrades and brothers, \\"Remember, one for all and all for one!\\" This strike lasted several weeks and created the momentum for the revolutionary movement in Russia. Sometimes abbreviated as Orekh (), a walnut or Orekhovo () flavored brandy is often drank to not forget the sacrifices that these strikers in 1885 went through to standup and improve the lives of workers throughout the world. The Soviet of Workers' Deputies in Orekhovo were elected in March 1917 as one of the first Bolshevik soviets in Russia. Six weeks later, the birthplace of Savva Morozov was controlled by the Soviets. This was six months before the Bolshevik victory in the October Revolution in Petrograd. In May 1917, the representative of the Moscow District Committee of the RSDLP(b) wrote: \\"The masses in Orekhovo are very well disciplined, following the Soviet of Workers' Deputies, in which all are Bolsheviks ... The influence of this organization is such that Orekhovo is now under the dictatorship of the proletariat.\\" Orekhovo-Zuyevo was granted city status on June 3, 1917. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Orekhovo- Zuyevo serves as the administrative center of Orekhovo-Zuyevsky District, even though it is not a part of it.Law #11/2013-OZ As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Orekhovo-Zuyevo City Under Oblast Jurisdiction‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Orekhovo-Zuyevo City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Orekhovo-Zuyevo Urban Okrug.Law #201/2004-OZ Economy For almost two centuries the economy of Orekhovo-Zuyevo was built on the textile industry, growing up around Savva Vasilievich Morozov's textile production. Cotton production in Orekhovo-Zuyevo made the city the third largest industrial center in Russia at the turn of the 20th century. After the Revolution of 1917, Morozov's textile mills were nationalized, becoming known as \\"Orekhovo-Zuyevsky Khlopchato-Bumazhny Kombinat\\" (the Orekhovo-Zuyevo Cotton Center). Textile production continued until the 1990s, when the Soviet textile industry collapsed due to poor management and the inability to compete with imported textiles, which were of better quality and cost less. Almost all production was shut down, and the factory halls were turned into market areas and trading centers. SportsAssociation football= The city is the home of the oldest association football team in Russia. The first football team in Orekhovo-Zuyevo was organized by British G. G. Charnock, the vice- president of the Moscow Football League. It has played under several different names. In the early years it was known as \\"Morozovtsy\\" (named after the Morozov family which owned the textile production in the city). During the Soviet era, the team played under the name Znamya Truda (lit. the Banner of Labor). After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the team was purchased by Spartak Moscow and became one of Spartak's farm teams, known as \\"Spartak- Orekhovo\\". In 2003, the team changed its name back to Znamya Truda. In 1962, Znamya Truda reached the USSR Cup finals, losing 0:2 to Shakhtar Donetsk. In the 2007 season, Znamya Truda played in the Central Zone of the Second Division. =Gymnastics= Olympic medalist and Junior European champion Anna Pavlova was born in Orekhovo-Zuyevo. =Badminton= Orekhovo-Zuyevo is famous for its badminton school. The city usually hosts the All-Russian badminton championships. =Sports facilities= There are three athletic/football stadiums in the city: \\"Znamya Truda\\", \\"Torpedo\\", and \\"Khimik\\". The swimming complex \\"Neptun\\" is adjacent to the \\"Znamya Truda\\" stadium. The swimming pool has lanes. A new sport complex facility \\"Vostok\\" was opened in 2007 by Boris Gromov, the then-Governor of Moscow Oblast.

Andechs Abbey is famed for its flamboyant Baroque church and its brewery, Klosterbrauerei Andechs. Composer Carl Orff is buried in the church.  Counts and dukes of Andechs  The site of Andechs was originally occupied by a castle belonging to the counts of Die√üen on the Ammersee, probably built on a Roman castrum, and remained the seat of the powerful counts of Die√üen-Andechs (1135 to 1180) and dukes of Andechs-Merania (1180 to 1248). In 1132 the count donated his ancestral seat at Die√üen to the Holy See and moved to Andechs. View of the Abbey. Otto II of Andechs was bishop of Bamberg from 1177 - 1196\\\\. In 1208, when Philip of Swabia, King of the Germans, was assassinated at Bamberg by Otto of Wittelsbach, members of the house of Andechs were implicated, and the castle at Andechs was razed before the family was rehabilitated. Saint Hedwig of Andechs (c. 1174 ‚Äì October 1243) born at Andechs, was one of eight children born to Berthold IV, Count of Die√üen-Andechs and Duke of Istria. Of her four brothers, two became bishops, Ekbert of Bamberg (1203 - 1231), and Berthold, Patriarch of Aquileia; Otto succeeded his father as Duke of Dalmatia, and Heinrich became Margrave of Istria. Of her three sisters, Gertrude of Andechs- Merania (1185‚ÄìSeptember 24, 1213) was the first wife of Andrew II of Hungary and the mother of St Elisabeth of Hungary; Mechtilde became Abbess of Kitzingen; while Agnes, a famous beauty, was made the unlawful wife of Philip Augustus of France in 1196, on the repudiation of his lawful wife, Ingeborg of Denmark, but was dismissed in 1200, after Pope Innocent III laid France under an interdict. When the dukes' direct male line of Andechs-Merania was extinguished in 1248, the entire region was annexed by the bishop of Bamberg. A history of the house of Andechs was written by Joseph Hormayr, Baron zu Hortenburg, the historian-statesman, and published in 1796.  The heilige Berg  Abbey Church In 955, relics brought from Rome and the Holy Land by Rasso, count of Diessen, to his monastery at W√∂rth (later called Grafrath) were transferred to the heilege Berg (holy mountain) to preserve them from the ravages of the Hungarians. In the 12th century three hosts, reputed to have been consecrated by Pope Gregory I and Pope Leo IX, were added to the relics at the heilige Berg. The first documented pilgrimages to Andechs were in 1138, when count Berthold II ordered his subjects to make the journey to venerate the relics in the chapel of St Nicholas at the Schloss. The legendary rediscovery of long-lost reliquaries in 1388 revived the ancient pilgrimage trade. The Andechs hosts were approved by Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, otherwise a foe of such cults of wonder hosts.Mitchell B. Merback, Pilgrimage and Pogrom: Violence, Memory and Visual Culture at the Host Miracle Shrines of Germany and Austria, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012, 163-170. The late-Gothic collegiate church which Duke Ernest I (1392 - 1438) had erected in 1423 was changed into a Benedictine monastery by Duke Albert III in 1455, and filled with monks from Tegernsee Abbey. In 1458 it was raised to the status of an abbey, and thenceforth enjoyed a period of uninterrupted prosperity, completely remodeled in Baroque style in 1712, and forming part of the Hofmark Erling (Heiliger Berg Andechs) until its secularization in 1803. It was refounded in 1850 as a Benedictine priory, affiliated to the Abbey of St Boniface in Munich. The present church dates from the 18th century. The 20th- century German composer Carl Orff is buried there. There are also the graves of 11 members of the House of Wittelsbach inside the church, mostly from the 15th and 16th centuries. More recent burials of members of the former Bavarian Royal Family took place on a graveyard in the abbey garden, installed by Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria in 1977, due to the fact that the royal tomb at Theatine Church, Munich had no more space. Erling, huddled at the foot of the abbey, was created as an independent town in 1818. Erling, Frieding and Machtlfing were united in 1978 as the Gemeinde Andechs.

He had ignored directions from his party leader, Ratu Tu'uakitau Cokanauto, to leave the building, and instead had participated in discussions that led to the formation of the Taukei Cabinet the next day, with himself as Minister for the Environment. At a second court appearance on 23 May 2005, he apologized to the coup victims, his constituency, and the nation. On 16 August, Justice Anthony Gates handed Tanaburenisau a two-year prison sentence, suspended on condition of continued good behaviour. Gates said that Tanaburenisau's role had been a relatively minor one, that he had gotten \\"carried away\\" and had acted without thinking of the consequences to himself or to his fellow- citizens. Gates said that he had taken Tanaburenisau's age into account, along with the fact that he had pleaded guilty, apologised, and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Tanaburenisau thanked the court for the suspended sentence, saying that his offence warranted a custodial sentence. He said that he was deeply sorry that his own errors of judgement had caused so much pain.

Biography Born in Fairborn, Ohio, and raised in the small Southern California town of Palos Verdes Estates, Turner originally intended to become a commercial artist. In elementary school he played the clarinet, followed by the alto and tenor saxophones in high school. He attended California State University, Long Beach in the 1980s (playing in the jazz ensembles) and then transferred to and graduated from Berklee College of Music in 1990 before moving to New York. Turner worked at Tower Records in New York City for an extended period before working full-time as a jazz musician. In early November 2008 Turner injured two fingers on one of his hands with a power saw, but as of late February 2009 he was performing again with the Edward Simon Quartet at the Village Vanguard. He is married to the psychiatrist and anthropologist, Dr. Helena Hansen. Style and influences Turner's sound is reminiscent of that of Warne Marsh, but he also has elements of John Coltrane in his playing. Turner has mentioned both Marsh and Coltrane as influences, and has used elements of both players' styles in his music. Turner's range extends into the high altissimo register. His improvised lines tend to span several octaves and contain great harmonic and rhythmic complexity. His compositions often make use of repeated patterns, odd-metered time signatures, and intervallic leaps. Turner claims that his music is \\"unfolding like a narrative\\". Consequently, his 2014 album Lathe of Heaven is named after Ursula K. Le Guin's novel of the same title which is based on the idea of a world where the nature of reality keeps shifting. Musical associations In September 2014, Turner released his first album as a leader since 2001 on ECM Records; it features trumpeter Avishai Cohen, bassist Joe Martin, and drummer Marcus Gilmore. Turner is a member of the trio Fly, which includes himself, bassist Larry Grenadier, and drummer Jeff Ballard. He also appears in guitarist Gilad Hekselman's Quartet, and drummer Billy Hart's Quartet. Turner has recorded extensively with guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, saxophonist David Binney, and pianist Aaron Goldberg, among others. Turner, the ultimate jazz sideman, has played or collaborated with more than 45 jazz bands. In 2018 and 2019 alone he has played on eight different jazz albums as a sideman or collaborator.

An Encyclopedia of British Women's Writing 1900-1950. Palgrave, 2008 (pp. 140‚Äì4) Life Leavis was born in Edmonton, England on 7 December 1906 to Morris Roth (1876‚Äì1953), hosier, and afterwards draper, and Jane Davis (1876‚Äì1940). She came from a Jewish family and her marriage to her Gentile husband F. R. Leavis caused a permanent rift with her relatives. Leavis attended Latymer School, Edmonton, and in 1925 won a scholarship to study English at Girton College, Cambridge.'Q. D. Leavis' http://www.leavissociety.com/q-d-leavis/index.html She graduated in 1928 with a first-class degree with distinction in the English tripos. Her PhD thesis, carried out under the supervision of I. A. Richards, became the book Fiction and the Reading Public (1932). Fiction and the Reading Public was influenced by Robert and Helen Lynd's book Middletown, the work of the anthropologist A. C. Haddon, and Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War by Wilfred Trotter.Chris Baldick, The Social Mission of English Criticism, 1848-1932. Oxford: Clarendon, 1987. (p. 194) It sought to account for what Leavis regarded as the cultural decline of literary standards by surveying the marketing of modern fiction. Leavis regarded modern literature as largely inferior to \\"unitary\\" literature of the 16th and 17th centuries. She wrote about the historical sociology of reading and the development of the English, the European, and the American novel. She paid particular attention to the writings of Jane Austen, George Eliot, Herman Melville, the Bront√´s, Edith Wharton and Charles Dickens. Leavis was noted for scrupulous detail in her research, but also for being sometimes irrationally pertinacious in the maintenance of her opinions. An example was the experience of her one-time pupil Valerie Grosvenor Myer, who entered the University of Cambridge as a mature student and was taught by Leavis in her final year. In a supervision on Hardy's Jude the Obscure, as Leavis held forth on the virtues of the organic community (an article of faith among the Scrutiny set), her student Grosvenor Myer, who had been brought up in a remote part of the Forest of Dean, commented that such communities could have their drawbacks. \\"I grew up till the age of 19 in a house without electricity or indoor sanitation,\\" she pointed out. \\"Nonsense, dear,\\" rejoined Leavis in not-to-be-contradicted tones; \\"you're much too young!\\" Leavis was unsympathetic to the feminist movement, and attacked Virginia Woolf's feminist polemic Three Guineas.Leavis, Q.D. \\"Caterpillars of the Commonwealth Unite!\\" Scrutiny (Sept 1938): 208 Much of her work was published collaboratively with her husband, F.

Barthold also known as Wilhelm Barthold; - 19 August 1930) was a Russian Empire and Soviet historian of German descent who specialized in the history of Islam and the Turkic peoples (Turkology). Bartold's lectures at the University of Saint Petersburg were annually interrupted by extended field trips to Muslim countries. In the two volumes of his dissertation (Turkestan down to the Mongol Invasion, 1898-1900), he pointed out the many benefits the Muslim world derived from Mongol rule after the initial conquests. Bartold was the first to publish obscure information from the early Arab historians on Kievan Rus'. He also edited several scholarly journals of Muslim studies, and contributed extensively to the first edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam. In 1913, he was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences. In February 1917 he was appointed to the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia. After the Russian Revolution, Bartold was appointed director of the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, a post he held from 1918 to 1921. He wrote three authoritative monographs on the history of Islam, namely Islam (1918), Muslim Culture (1918) and The Muslim World (1922). He also contributed to the development of Cyrillic writing for the Muslim countries of Central Asia. Most of his writings were translated in English, Arabic, and Persian. Bartold's collected works were reprinted in 9 volumes between 1963 and 1977, and whilst Soviet editors added footnotes deploring his 'bourgeois' attitudes, his prestige was such that the text was left uncensored, despite not conforming to a Marxist interpretation of history. Some of his works have been reprinted more recently in Moscow. Works (selection) * ¬´–£–ª—É–≥–±–µ–∫ –∏ –µ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è¬ª Ulugh-Beg (Leyden: 1918) ** \\"Ulug Beg und seine Zeit\\".

Its waters are shared between the provinces of Bahoruco and Independencia, the latter of which borders Haiti. Lake Enriquillo is the largest lake in both the Dominican Republic and Hispaniola, as well as the entire Caribbean. It is also the lowest point for an island country.https://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/highlow.htm Hydrology Lake Enriquillo seen from Las Caritas National Park, near La Descubierta Lake Enriquillo covers an area of 145 mi2 (375 km2), and is the lowest point for an island country, falling below sea level. Its drainage basin includes 10 minor river systems. The rivers that rise in the Neiba Mountains to the north (lower center and lower right of the image) are perennial. Those rivers that rise in the Baoruco Mountains to the south are intermittent. Lake Enriquillo has no outlet. The lake's water level varies because of a combination of storm-driven precipitation events and the region's high evaporation rate. Salinity in the lake can vary between 33 parts per thousand (comparable to seawater) and over 100 parts per thousand (hypersaline). The region has a hot, semiarid climate. Annual rainfall is not evenly distributed, with peak precipitation occurring in May and October. The dry season is December through April when rainfall may be less than . Due to the length of the lake, annual rainfall averages also vary at the eastern and western ends: on the northwest shore, and in the southeast. =Flooding trend= Between 2004 and 2009, the lake doubled its surface area. Records for 2004 show the lake to be ; measurements from 2011 put the area at . Reasons for the flooding are being debated, but may be a combination of several, including increases in rainfall in the region in recent years, increase of sediments going into the lake from run-off due to deforestation that are contributing to raising the lakebed, and milder temperatures, which are reducing the surface evaporation rate. Geography The lake lies in a valley that stretches from near Port-au-Prince in Haiti to Bahia de Neiba in the Dominican Republic. The valley is known as the Hoya de Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic and as the Plain du Cul-de-Sac in Haiti. Parts of the depression are below sea level and are covered by large salt lakes, including Lake Enriquillo and the Etang Saum√¢tre. There are three islands in the lake: Barbarita, Islita, and Isla Cabritos. Once, when water levels dropped during dry spells, the islands were linked to one another by sandbars. As of December 2011, only Isla Cabritos remains; the other two islands are submerged by the rising level of the lake. Geology Lake Enriquillo is located within a linear depression that formed as a ramp basin between the Haiti fold and thrust belt to the north and the uplifted oceanic crust of the Massif de la Selle-Sierra de Bahoruco to the south. The Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault is a later strike-slip fault, cutting across the depression, which extends from Jamaica in the west, to near Neiba in the Dominican Republic in the east. The valley, a former marine strait, was created around one million years ago when the water level fell and the strait was filled in by sediments of the Yaque del Sur River. Tremors in the region are common. Ecology Lake Enriquillo is home to the largest population of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) in the Caribbean. Three species of fish inhabit the lake: the blackbanded limia (Limia melanonotata), the Hispaniolan gambusia (Gambusia hispaniolae), and the Hispaniola pupfish (Cyprinodon bondi). Two endangered iguanas endemic to Hispaniola live sympatrically on Isla Cabritos: the Ricord's iguana (Cyclura ricordi), and the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta). Among the numerous bird species found at the lake, American flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) are prominent; flocks of flamingos are especially concentrated on Isla Cabritos and near the eastern end of the lake. Plants that thrive in arid places, such as cacti, can be found here. A national park was established in 1974 to preserve the area; in 2002 it was combined with two other parks to form the Jaragua-Bahoruco-Enriquillo Biosphere Reserve. History South shore of Lake Enriquillo, looking northward to the Sierra de Neiba mountains; Independencia Province, Dominican Republic The lake is named after Enriquillo, a cacique of the indigenous Ta√≠no, who rebelled against the Spaniards in the early 16th century, and hid in the mountains south of the lake. It was previously called Lake Xaragua, after the Taino chiefdom in which it was located. Economy Land near Lake Enriquillo has long been used for agriculture, such as banana, sweet potato and yuca farms, and pasture for cattle. The rising water levels have affected hundreds of nearby residents in townships bordering the lake, with abundant loss of agricultural land. Important towns near the shores of Enriquillo include Neiba, the capital of Baoruco Province, on the northeast, and Jiman√≠, the capital of Independencia Province, at the western end of the lake near the border with Haiti. La Descubierta is the town nearest to the entrance of Lago Enriquillo e Isla Cabritos National Park. The community of Boca de Cachon, near the lake and severely affected by the rising waters, has been the subject of government relocation efforts including the construction of a new town further from the shores of Enriquillo.

It was sold by Austin from 1958 until 1982, when Carbodies, who had been producing the FX4 for Austin, took over the intellectual rights to the car. They continued production until 1984, when London Taxis International took over rights and production continued until 1997. In all, more than 75,000 FX4s were built. Design and launch The FX4 London taxi was the successor to the Austin FX3 (produced between 1948 and 1958). In its day the FX3 was the most widely used taxi in London. Like the FX3, the FX4 was designed by Austin in collaboration with Mann & Overton, the London taxi dealership that commissioned it (and paid for half of its cost) and Carbodies, the coachbuilder that built the body and assembled the cab ready for sale. The design team included Albert Moore from Austin's engineering division, Jack Hellberg from Carbodies and David Southwell of Mann & Overton. The original design was by Austin's Eric Bailey and it was engineered for production by Carbodies' Jake Donaldson. It would be the first London taxi to go into production that had four doors, since earlier London taxis had featured a luggage platform that was open to the elements on the pavement/sidewalk side in lieu of a front passenger seat. Like the FX3, the FX4 had a separate chassis, but with independent front suspension and dual-circuit hydraulic brakes. FX4 front steering feature Ackermann steering geometry which allowed the car to make U-turns in just 7.6 m (25 ft), a requirement for the narrow roads of London.https://transportevolved.com/2016/05/31/london-taxi-company- of-coventry-england-provides-first-details-of-its-tx-5-plug-in-hybrid-taxi/ The first FX4, registration number VLW 431, was delivered in July 1958 and went on test with York Way Motors. The official launch was later that year at the Commercial Motor Exhibition. Austin era 1970 FX4 1977 FX4 = FX4 = The first model of FX4 was fitted with a 2178 cc Austin diesel engine and a Borg-Warner automatic transmission. In 1961, the manual transmission from the Austin Gipsy was added as an option. From 1962, the Austin 2199 cc petrol engine was available. However, almost all FX4 taxis were fitted with a Diesel engine. With the sudden demise of the intended replacement in 1969, the cab was revised and updated to address shortcomings of the original. The original Austin design had a small rear light cluster and roof-mounted turn indicators (commonly known as \\"bunny ears\\"). On the revised model, the rear wings were modified to accept the taillights and turn indicators from the MkII Austin 1100/1300. Front indicators were also provided below the headlights and repeater indicators fitted to the front wings. and \\"bunny ears\\" were abandoned. More important to the drivers of the FX4, the interior was also revised. Sound deadening, black vinyl seats and an altered partition (with an additional 4 inches of legroom) were warmly welcomed. = FX4D = In 1971, the 2178 cc diesel engine was replaced by a larger, 2520 cc version. This engine proved to be better for use with an automatic transmission and gradually fewer cabs with manual gearboxes were sold. The petrol engine was discontinued in 1973. This model was available from 1971 through 1982. In 1973, Carbodies' owner BSA, by now confronting imminent bankruptcy, was bought by Manganese Bronze Holdings, who were happy to continue making the FX4. Detail changes, such as burst-proof door locks and push-button door handles, safety steering and moulded rubber overriders (designed because the original tooling for the chrome overriders had worn out) were implemented. BMLC was turmoil themselves by this time, so while on paper they were involved with the FX4, in reality they did little more than rubber stamp changes that Carbodies undertook. Carbodies era FX4R = In 1982, Carbodies (who had been producing the FX4 for Austin and Mann & Overton) took over the cab's intellectual property rights when BL (Austin's parent company) lost interest in it; Carbodies thereafter produced it under their own name. The old Austin engine was no longer available because, during Michael Edwardes' reconstruction of British Leyland, the plant had been sold to India. Carbodies selected the Land Rover 2286 cc diesel engine in its place and also offered the similar-sized Land Rover petrol engine as an option. The new model was branded the FX4R, with R standing for Rover. The FX4R had some improvements over the previous FX4 models, including power steering and full servo brakes, but its performance and reliability were poor and the cab gained a bad reputation. 1985 FX4Q Some proprietors replaced the Land Rover engine with the Perkins/Mazda 2977 cc diesel, which improved the performance of the cab dramatically. Whilst powerful and reliable, the Perkins conversion gained a reputation for being noisy at idle and, mistakenly, for causing cracks in the chassis. The chassis problem, which was also occurring on late model Austins, was traced to a manufacturing fault. = FX4Q = In order to regain lost sales due to the FX4R's failure, Carbodies took old chassis and suspension components and refurbished them, fitting new bodywork and the original-type 2520 cc diesel engines re-imported from India. Because these vehicles used refurbished chassis and suspension components, they were required to have a registration mark starting with the letter Q rather than the current year letter and thus this model was known as the FX4Q. All were fitted with automatic gearboxes, but not the power steering fitted to the FX4R. Sold by the dealer Rebuilt Cabs Ltd, they were marginally cheaper than the FX4R. LTI era 1988 FX4S = FX4S = In 1984 London Taxis International (LTI) was formed after Manganese Bronze Holdings bought the London taxi dealers Mann & Overton. LTI replaced the 2286 cc Land Rover diesel engine with the new 2495 cc version. The new model was called the FX4S. New rocker switches replaced the old toggle switches on the dashboard, the wipers were controlled by a stalk on the steering column and draught proofing was added to the bottoms of the doors and black rolled steel bumpers fitted, but basically it was an updated version of the cab that had been around for almost 30 years. At this time, Carbodies were developing a replacement for the FX4, the CR6, which is why this 'stopgap' FX4S was introduced. However, the CR6 was abandoned in 1985 and MBH decided to carry on making the FX4 until such time as it could fund a new cab. = FX4S-Plus = The FX4S was superseded in 1987 by the FX4S-Plus, which had a rear compartment redesigned to allow five passengers, the trim changed to grey. A new grey plastic moulded dashboard was also fitted. This was received very well by the trade, as a sign that their needs were actually being listened to. = FX4W = The Department for Transport was keen to see wheelchair accessible taxis and the FX4W wheelchair conversion, which was available from early 1986, enabled the FX4 to provide that facility. In this, the kerb side passenger door was made capable of opening 180¬∞ and the nearside part of the partition could be moved forward to accommodate the rearward facing wheelchair in place of the nearside tip-up seat. Fairway = Fairway = In February 1989 the Fairway was introduced. It was fitted with a 2,664 cc Nissan TD27 diesel engine. This made the FX4 a faster and more reliable cab. It had full wheelchair accessibility, in line with a new law that came into force in January 1989. The Fairway was the best version of the FX4 ever built, and enabled LTI to sell to overseas markets, as well as move into provincial UK markets they had not been able to tackle. Much of this increase in sales was due to local authorities insisting on wheelchair accessible cabs being used in their areas. = Fairway Driver = As part of a programme to develop a replacement model, AP Lockheed were commissioned to design and develop front disc brakes, and in conjunction, GKN designed a new suspension system to allow disc brakes to be fitted whilst maintaining the mandatory 7.6 m turning circle. These modifications were fitted to a new model, the Fairway Driver, which was introduced in February 1992. The very final Fairway made, with registration mark R1 PFX (i.e. RIP FX), was built on 1 October 1997 and was presented to the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. End of an era FX4 with successor models. From left to right: the TX4, TX1 and FX4 Transport for London, (TfL) who had taken over control of the Public Carriage Office ruled that by 2006 all taxis licensed in London should comply with Euro 3 exhaust emission regulations. The Fairway, and for that matter its replacement the TX1, used the same Nissan engine which complied with Euro 2. Most proprietors were reluctant to get rid of their very reliable and economical Fairways. In the face of pressure from the trade, TfL allowed different conversions systems to be developed that could be fitted to the Nissan engine to make it comply. These were the STT Emtec Clean Cab turbocharger system and the Van Aaken exhaust gas recirculation system. Only 80 Austin and Rover-engined cabs remained on the road, which made it uneconomical to develop conversions for them so they were granted an exemption. Although some owners of older Fairways got rid of them, many owners opted to spend almost ¬£2,000 having their cabs converted. They did this rather than buy a new or second-hand TXII, which was considered to be very unreliable. In late 2009, only six of the earlier Rover or Austin-engined cabs remained in service the street, most having covered more than a million miles each. The Fairway was replaced in late 1997 by the TX1, which was subsequently replaced in 2002 by the TXII. This in turn was replaced in 2007 by the TX4. Non-taxi versions FL2 = 1965 FL2, note the extra brightwork The Austin FL2 Hire Car was the limousine version of the FX4. Introduced at the same time as the FX4, it was aimed at the private hire, limousine and funeral trade and this market was the main reason why the petrol engine was offered in the vehicle. It had forward-facing occasional seats, a second front seat and carried no roof sign. It could also be ordered with special trim at extra cost. It was also the base of a few hearses. The FL2 was relaunched in 1982 as the FL2 London Limousine, based on the FX4R. Air conditioning was offered as well as a wider range of luxury interior options, including a cocktail cabinet and custom sound systems. Three stretch versions were built, with four doors and an 18-inch extension between the front and rear doors. A six-door version of the FX4S was also built. The FL2 designation was dropped around 1987, but limousine versions of the Fairway were ordered, the most prominent being that belonging to the Crown Prince of Tonga. The FL2 and the FX4 were also sold to private customers. FL2 customers included Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Laurence Olivier. Stephen Fry owned a Fairway as his own private transport. An FL2 limousine was the official car of the Governor of the Falkland Islands, Rex Hunt at the time of the Argentine invasion.

He was affiliated with the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) before World War II. At one time, he was part of the literary avant-garde, writing in an expressionist style. With the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany, modernist artistic movements were suppressed. Becher escaped from a military raid in 1933 and settled in Paris for a couple of years. He migrated to the Soviet Union in 1935 with the central committee of the KPD. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Becher and other German communists were evacuated to internal exile in Tashkent. He returned to favor in 1942 and was recalled to Moscow. After the end of World War II, Becher left the Soviet Union and returned to Germany, settling in the Soviet-occupied zone that later became East Berlin. As a member of the KPD, he was appointed to various cultural and political positions and became part of the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party. In 1949, he helped found the DDR Academy of Arts, Berlin, and served as its president from 1953 to 1956. In 1953 he was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize (later the Lenin Peace Prize). He was the culture minister of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1954 to 1958. Early life Johannes R. Becher was born in Munich in 1891, the son of Judge Heinrich Becher and his wife Johanna, n√©e B√ºrck. He attended local schools. In April 1910, Becher and Fanny Fuss, a young woman he had encountered in January of that year, planned a joint suicide; Becher shot them both, killing her and wounding himself severely.Robert K. Shirer, \\"Johannes R. Becher 1891‚Äì1958\\", Encyclopedia of German Literature, Chicago and London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 2000, by permission at Digital Commons, University of Nebraska, accessed 3 February 2013 His father succeeds in quashing the case of killing on demand. Becher is certified insanity. His early poetry was filled with struggling to come to terms with this event. From 1911 he studied medicine and philosophy in college in Munich and Jena. He left his studies and became an expressionist writer, his first works appearing in 1913. An injury from his suicide attempt made him unfit for military service/ and he became addicted to morphine, which he struggled with for the rest of the decade. Political activity in Germany He was also engaged in many communist organisations, joining the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1917, then went over to the Spartacist League in 1918 from which emerged the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1920 he left the KPD, disappointed with the failure of the German Revolution, and embraced religion. In 1923, he returned to the KPD and very actively worked within the party. His art entered an expressionist period, from which he would later dissociate himself. He was part of die Kugel, an artistic group based in Magdeburg. During this time, he published in the magazines Verfall und Triumph, Die Aktion (The Action) and Die neue Kunst. In 1925 government reaction against his anti-war novel, (CHCI=CH)3As (Levisite) oder Der einzig gerechte Krieg, resulted in his being indicted for \\"literarischer Hochverrat\\" or \\"literary high treason\\". It was not until 1928 that this law was amended. That year, Becher became a founding member of the KPD-aligned Association of Proletarian- Revolutionary Authors (Bund proletarisch-revolution√§rer Schriftstellers), serving as its first chairman and co-editor of its magazine, Die Linkskurve. From 1932 Becher became a publisher of the newspaper, Die Rote Fahne. In the same year he was elected representing the KPD to the Reichstag. Fleeing from Nazis After the Reichstag fire, Becher was placed on the Nazi blacklist, but he escaped from a large raid in the Berlin artist colony near Breitenbachplatz in Wilmersdorf. By March 15, 1933 he, with the support of the secretary of the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors, traveled to the home of Willy Harzheim. After staying briefly in Brno, he moved to Prague after some weeks. He traveled on to Zurich and Paris, where he lived for a time as part of the large √©migr√© community. There his portrait was done by the Hungarian artist, Lajos Tihanyi, whom he befriended.Valerie Majoros, \\"Lajos Tihanyi and his friends in the Paris of the nineteen-thirties\\", French Cultural Studies, 2000, Vol. 11:387, Sage Publications, accessed 30 January 2013 Finally, in 1935 Becher emigrated to the USSR as did other members of the central committee of the KPD. In Moscow he became editor-in-chief of the German √©migr√© magazine, Internationale Literatur-Deutsche Bl√§tter. He was selected as a member of the Central Committee of the KPD. Soon Becher was caught up in the midst of the Great Purge. In 1935 he was accused of links with Leon Trotsky. Becher tried to save himself by ‚Äúinforming‚Äù on other writers' alleged political misdemeanors. From 1936, he was forbidden to leave the USSR. During this period, he struggled with depression and tried several times to commit suicide. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 horrified German communists. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the government evacuated the German communists to internal exile. Becher was evacuated to Tashkent, as were most of the communist √©migr√©s. It became the center of evacuation for hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians from the war zones, and the government relocated industry here to preserve some capacity from the Germans. During his time in Tashkent, he befriended Georg Luk√°cs, the Hungarian philosopher and literary critic, who was also evacuated there.Georg Luk√°cs, translated by Jeremy Gaines and Paul Keast, German Realists in the Nineteenth Century, ed. Rodney Livingstone, MIT Press, 2000, p. xv They intensively studied 18th- and 19th-century literature together, after which Becher turned from modernism to Socialist Realism. Becher was recalled to Moscow by 1942. In 1943, he became one of the founders of the National Committee for a Free Germany. Return to East Germany After the Second World War, Becher returned to Germany with a KPD team, where he settled in the Soviet zone of occupation. There he was appointed to various cultural- political positions. He took part in the establishment of the Cultural Association, to \\"revive German culture,\\" and founded the Aufbau-Verlag publishing house and the literature magazine, Sinn und Form. He also contributed to the satirical magazine, Ulenspiegel. In 1946, Becher was selected for the Party Executive Committee and the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party. After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) on 7 October 1949, he became a member of the Volkskammer. He also wrote the lyrics to Hanns Eisler's melody \\"Auferstanden aus Ruinen,\\" which became the national anthem of the GDR. That year, he helped establish the DDR Academy of Arts, Berlin. He served as its president from 1953 to 1956, succeeding Arnold Zweig. In January 1953 he received the Stalin Peace Prize (later renamed the Lenin Peace Prize) in Moscow. In Leipzig in 1955, the German Institute for Literature was founded and originally named in Becher's honor. The Institute's purpose was to train socialist writers. Institute graduates include Erich Loest, Volker Braun, Sarah Kirsch and Rainer Kirsch. From 1954 to 1958, Becher served as Minister of Culture of the GDR. During the Khrushchev Thaw, Becher fell out of favor. Internal struggles of the party eventually lead to his political demotion in 1956. Late in his life, Becher began to renounce socialism. His book Das poetische Prinzip (The Poetic Principle) wherein he calls socialism the fundamental error of his life [\\"Grundirrtum meines Lebens\\"] was only published in 1988. Becher's grave in Berlin The following year, in declining health, Becher gave up all his offices and functions in September 1958. He died of cancer on 11 October 1958 in the East Berlin government hospital. Becher was buried at the Dorotheenstadt cemetery in the Berlin center, with his gravesite designated as a grave of honor () of Berlin. Becher lived in Majakowskiring 34 street, Pankow, East Berlin. Legacy and honours Although the party praised Becher after his death as the \\"greatest German poet in recent history\\", his work was criticised by younger East German authors as backward and politically embarrassing. Examples include Katja Lange-M√ºller who called him a \\"Neanderthal minister of culture [Neandertaler von Kulturminister]\\".

History In 1990, a group of friends were attending college at Virginia Tech in the mountains of Virginia. Among them were Stephen Jackson and Chris Watt, who had previously dabbled in playing punk rock covers. Soon after, a mutual friend, Tal Bayer, began attending nearby Radford University. He was interested in ska, reggae and rugby and suggested that they form a ska band. After recruiting a high school friend, Tom Goodin, and an architecture classmate, Ben Gauslin, The Slugs were born. Soon, they were skipping classes, melding ska, R & B, and punk rock while practicing for hours to learn songs by Madness, The Specials, Bad Manners, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Burial, The Skatalites, The Business, The Four Skins and others. Unfortunately, the name The Slugs was already taken and the band needed a new name. For a few months, the name was changed to the Dancecrashers. It was too similar to another ska band out west, so the search for a new name continued. Some British neighbors used to refer to the heftier guys in the band as Pietasters, which is British slang for \\"fat guys\\", chanting \\"They'll eat your pies, they'll tell you lies, you won't believe the bastards' size! The Pietasters!\\" This was part of a British football chant, and was probably based on the Macc Lads tune \\"Fat Bastard\\", the original lyrics being \\"He'll eat your pies, he'll tell you lies, You wouldn't believe that fat bastard's size\\". Continuing the Macc Lads theme, the band's name may also have been based on the Macc Lads single, \\"Pietaster\\". One way or the other, the name stuck and The Pietasters were born. While in the midst of the name change, the newly formed Pietasters managed to convince the local college booking agency to fly in their heroes Bad Manners from England to perform at the school auditorium at Virginia Tech, with themselves conveniently as the opening act. This was their first official performance, their prior performances mostly relegated to the living room of Chris and Steve's rental house, where they had built a stage in the living room and threw shows on the weekends. The two bands eventually became close friends and later toured the U.S. and Europe together. In the early 1990s, a similar band from the DC area, The Skunks, asked The Pietasters to play a local ska night at a bar in Georgetown. Soon, they were playing every dive bar in DC, Maryland and Virginia. The manager of one such bar, Nick Nichols] befriended the band and helped them record their first record, The Pietasters, more commonly known as Piestomp. In the summer of 1993, The Pietasters set out on their first national tour in a used school bus they'd bought for $900. The tour was haphazard, with stops in Ohio, Oregon, Kansas, and even many in Canada. By the end of the tour, almost all of the original members quit the band. To this day, only trumpeter Carlos Linares and lead singer Steve Jackson remain as original members. The Pietasters auditioned many players and decided on Jeremy Roberts, Toby Hansen, and Alan Makranczy as their horn players, Rob Steward (Covington) on drums, and Paul Ackerman on keys. Tom Goodin remained on guitar. The new line-up continued to tour whenever possible, and soon attracted the attention of Bucket Hingley, front man of The Toasters and owner of Moon Ska Records. He asked if The Pietasters wanted to be a part of a tour package called \\"Skavoovie 94\\". The Pietasters accepted and were soon touring with The Toasters and The Scofflaws, and performed with a variety of other artists, including No Doubt, the (original) Dance Hall Crashers, Hepcat, Let's Go Bowling, and the Skatalites. The tour was much more organized than their last outing and proved to be very educational. By the end of the tour, The Pietasters were scheduled to record Oolooloo on Moon Ska with Victor Rice producing. Oolooloo came out in the summer of 1995, after which bassist Chris Watt left the Pietasters to perform with Eastern Standard Time, and Todd Eckhart moved from rhythm guitar to bass. In 1995, a long-time fan of the band and the lead singer of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dicky Barrett, showed up at one of their shows in Providence, Rhode Island. The Pietasters were considering breaking up, but Dicky offered to take them on the road over the next few years. As the Pietasters continued to tour the country, they recorded Strapped Live! between stops in the Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and The Black Cat in Washington, DC. Strapped Live! was released in 1996 and quickly became a fan favorite and the closest thing to a live Pietasters show. Throughout this period, The Pietasters had been recording new songs, re-recording older ones, and recording some covers. The results ended up as a new/compilation album, Comply, and the song selection foreshadowed their next release. Meanwhile, the band filmed their first video in 1996, a live video filmed at the Scooter Rally and F'n Rock Party they produced at an old outdoor soul venue called Wilmer's Alley in Brandywine, Maryland. The video was filmed by Burning Toast Productions and featured scenes of the festival and live performance of the Pietasters playing their Jimmy Holiday cover, \\"The New Breed\\". While touring with The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, the band made a stop in Los Angeles. Backstage at the show, Tim Armstrong, originally from Operation Ivy and current guitarist for the band, Rancid and his business partner, Chris \\"the Wix\\" Qualiana (who can be seen in a wig on the cover of a few Slackers albums), approached the band and asked if they'd like to be a part of a new label they were putting together, Hellcat Records. The Slackers, Hepcat and Dropkick Murphys were already committed and they wanted The Pietasters on board. After clearing such a move with Moon Ska, The Pietasters signed with Hellcat, a subsidiary of Epitaph Records, and their next album, Willis was recorded and released in 1997, and produced by Brett Gurewitz, owner of Epitaph Records and guitarist for Bad Religion. The Pietasters recorded their second video, \\"Stone Feeling\\", to support this album, another live video with the assistance of Burning Toast Productions, and filmed at a venue in Washington, D.C., and another video for \\"Out All Night\\", also filmed in Washington, D.C. and directed by Grady Cooper. A tour of the US soon followed as well as their first ever tour of Europe. The Pietasters also made appearances on the Warped Tour and opened or headlined for such acts as The Reverend Horton Heat, the Ramones, the Cherry Poppin Daddies, Bad Brains, Ozomatli, The Bouncing Souls, Dropkick Murphy's, Murphy's Law, Fugazi, They Might Be Giants, H20, the Skatalites and Flogging Molly. Their song \\"Out All Night,\\" was featured in the videogames Street Sk8er for the PlayStation, and NCAA Football 06. By 1999, The Pietasters were in the studio again to record Awesome Mix Tape No. 6 for Epitaph's Hellcat Records, once again recorded and produced by Brett Gurewitz, with portions of the album recorded at Tim Armstrong's house. The album was named after the mix-tape from Boogie Nights. The Pietasters recorded their next video, \\"Yesterday's Over\\", to support the album. They finished the album and set out on the road again touring Europe with the Warped Tour, then the US again with the Pilfers and Spring Heeled Jack, and closing out 1999 with an opening stint for Joe Strummer. Years of touring finally took its toll on Paul Ackerman and Tom Goodin, who amicably left the band. Bassist Todd Eckhardt also left the band and was replaced by Jorge Pezzimenti of Virginia band, The Decepticonz. Erick Morgan, formerly of The Skunks, took over keys, and Toby Hansen replaced Tom Goodin on guitar. In late 2001, The Pietasters were recording their next album when they learned that former bassist, Todd Eckhardt, had died of a viral heart infection. The news was extremely hard on The Pietasters and their fans. The Bouncing Souls included \\"Todd's Song\\" on their Anchor's Away album in his memory. The Pietasters released a new album in 2002 titled Turbo, a nickname of Todd's. The album won praise from fans and critics alike. It even caught the attention of James Brown who asked The Pietasters to be his backing band at a sold-out concert (local radio station WHFS' Holiday Nutcracker) in Washington DC in December 2002. In 2003, The Pietasters released their live DVD, Live at The 9:30 Club. In 2006, The Pietasters played the International Ska Circus in Las Vegas. On August 21, 2007, The Pietasters released a new studio album entitled All Day. In 2010, the Pietasters performed at the 9:30 Club's 30th anniversary in Washington D.C., and were introduced by Henry Rollins. In November 2011, Connecticut's Asbestos Records and Chicago's Underground Communiqu√© Records launched a fundraiser together on Kickstarter to release Oolooloo on vinyl, among other third-wave ska classics from Pilfers, Edna's Goldfish, and Suburban Legends. On April 20, 2020, the band issued a statement on Facebook saying that their former keyboard player Erick Morgan had passed away on April 18 due to pneumonia and that a GoFundMe page had been set up to help his mother with funeral costs.

It diverges from the main stem a few miles upstream of the main stem's confluence with the Columbia River in Multnomah County in the U.S. state of Oregon. The channel flows northwest then north around Sauvie Island to meet the Columbia River near the city of St. Helens, in Columbia County. Chinook people, the Multnomahs, lived in villages along the channel at the time of European exploration of the Columbia River in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Flanked in the 21st century by moorages, marinas, and parks, and populated by a wide variety of fish, the channel offers many opportunities for recreation. Course Constrained by dikes, the channel is about one-third as wide as the lower Willamette main stem.Williams, pp. 205-07 U.S. Route 30 and tracks of the Burlington Northern Railroad run roughly parallel to the channel, and to its left, between its source and the Multnomah-Columbia county border at about the channel's river mile (RM) 12.5 or river kilometer (RK) 20.1. The maps, which include river mile (RM) markers for the channel's entire length, involve the following quadrangles from mouth to source: Saint Helens, Sauvie Island, Linnton. In its first , the channel receives Miller Creek from the left, then passes under Sauvie Island Bridge, which carries Northwest Sauvie Island Road. Below the bridge, Ennis Creek enters from the left, then McCarthy Creek from the left at RM 18 (RK 29). Further along, Johns Creek enters from the left, and then Joy Creek enters from the left where the channel leaves Multnomah County and enters Columbia County. About from the mouth, the channel flows around Coon Island. Shortly thereafter, Crane Slough, which drains Crane's Lake, and the Gilbert River, which drains Sturgeon Lake, enter from the right. Then the channel receives Jackson Creek from the left and Cunningham Slough from the right before flowing around Louse Island and merging with Scappoose Bay, which is on the left. St. Helens is on the left as the channel enters the Columbia, about from the larger stream's mouth on the Pacific Ocean. A few islands, most notably Coon Island and Louse Island, are located within the channel. Name and history The channel had a variety of names before the United States Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) agreed to Multnomah Channel in 1913. In 1792, William Robert Broughton was the first European explorer to discover the channel. He named it Calls River, probably after the English engineer Sir John Call. The early 19th century explorers Lewis and Clark called it Wappato Inlet after Wappato Island, the name they used for Sauvie Island. In the 1840s, nautical surveyor Charles Wilkes referred to the channel as Warrior Branch because it met the Columbia River at Warrior Point, on the northern tip of Sauvie Island. Before its renaming by the USBGN, the channel had become known as Willamette Slough. Multnomah, used by Lewis and Clark to refer to the main stem of the Willamette, is what the Chinook people living on Sauvie Island in the early 19th century called themselves.McArthur, pp. 683-84 Several Chinook villages with longhouses occupied sites along the channel before the explorers' arrival. Sauvie Island and its mild climate were suited to wapato, a root vegetable, and provided access to fish and game. A large village, one of several on the island, was situated near its southeastern tip, where the channel begins. Another village, with 28 houses and more than 1,000 residents, was sited along the west shore of Scappoose Bay near the downstream end of the channel. Recreation The channel offers many moorages for boats and houseboats. Private moorages and marinas, some with public fee-for-service boat ramps, lie along the channel between the main stem and the Sauvie Island Bridge. Further downriver is the Sauvie Island Public Boat Ramp at RM 18 (RK 29), followed by Hadley's Landing and its tie-up and trail later. The Sauvie Island Wildlife Area begins at about the halfway point on the channel and extends from there to the mouth along the right bank. A major stopover for birds, it can be reached by boat from the Gilbert River Boat Ramp at RM 6 (RK 10). Parks near the mouth include Sand Island Marine Park at St. Helens, St. Helens Landing, Columbia View Park at Scappoose Bay, and Scappoose Bay Landing. A productive fishery for spring Chinook salmon, the channel is also home to sturgeon, walleye, shad, brown bullhead catfish, and other small fish, and crayfish. The average Chinook entering the channel weighs , but some weigh as much as . Oregon's lower-Willamette health advisories on consumption of resident (non-migratory) fish, especially large bottom feeders, apply to the Multnomah Channel as well as the main stem.Sheehan, pp. 159-60 See also * List of longest streams of Oregon * List of rivers of Oregon ReferencesWorks cited * McArthur, Lewis A.; McArthur, Lewis L.

The New York Times described Auldridge as \\"one of the most distinctive dobro players in the history of country and bluegrass music while widening its popularity among urban audiences\\". He also worked as a graphic artist. Biography Auldridge was born in Washington, D.C.,[ Allmusic biography] and grew up in the suburban town of Kensington, Maryland. He attended Wheaton High School and, while in his teens, took classes at the Corcoran College of the Arts and Design. Inspired by his uncle, steel guitarist Ellsworth T. Cozzens who had performed with Jimmie Rodgers during the 1920s, Auldridge started playing guitar at the age of 13. His main influence through his early years was Josh Graves who also sold him his first dobro. A 1967 graduate of The University of Maryland, Auldridge worked as a graphic artist for a commercial art firm in Bethesda, Maryland and then for the now-defunct Washington Star-News. He did not start playing music full-time until the Washington Star-News folded in 1981. Auldridge last played with Darren Beachley and The Legends of the Potomac bluegrass band. Past bands include The Country Gentlemen, Emerson and Waldron, Cliff Waldron and the New Shades of Grass, Seldom Scene (of which he was a founding member), Chesapeake, The Good Deale Bluegrass Band, and John Starling and Carolina Star (which featured three original members of The Seldom Scene).

He worked with Paul Beard (Beard Guitars) to produce the Beard Mike Auldridge Models of square-neck resophonic guitars (dobro), including an 8-string version. Auldridge died on December 29, 2012, just one day prior to his 74th birthday, at home under hospice care in Silver Spring, Maryland after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer. Awards Auldridge was nominated for four Grammy awards, including twice for Best Bluegrass Album with The Seldom Scene, in 1992 and 1994. He won numerous awards including Frets Magazine's \\"Dobro Player of the Year\\" and the International Bluegrass Music Association's Distinguished Achievement Award.

Title  South of the Border is a song about Mexico. But what is west of the sun? Shimamoto called it hysteria Siberia and told one story: \\"Try to imagine this, you‚Äôre a farmer, living all alone on the Siberian tundra. Day after day you plow your fields. As far as the eye can see, nothing. To the north, the horizon, to the east, the horizon, to the south, to the west, more of the same. Every morning, when the sun rises in the east, you go out to work in your fields. When it‚Äôs directly overhead, you take a break for lunch. When it sinks in the west, you go home to sleep. In the winter they stay home and do indoor work. When spring comes, they head out to the fields again. Anyway, that cycle continues, year after year, and then one day, something inside you dies. Maybe nothing or maybe something in the west of the sun. At any rate, it‚Äôs different from south of the border.‚Äù Main characters Hajime Hajime grew up in a small family. It could be called the minimal familial unit as he was an only child. Being the only child, in a society where two children is the norm made him feel inferior. The most unendurable is the prejudice against only children by others. Many think that not having siblings means one must be spoiled by their parents, sickly, and extremely selfish. These accusations irritate him, but deep inside he fears they are true. He tried to remain unseen and ignore these weaknesses, but someone always happened to point his lack of siblings out. Friendless and aloof his childhood was dominated by solitude and isolation. Hajime's peace did not remain unharmed even during his university years, where the polarizing environment of campus politics made turned the world even more hostile towards him. He opposed the economical bubble of post-war Japanese capitalism. However, later on, with the help of his father-in-law's capital, he opens a Jazz club, and according to his benefactor's wishes, Hajime invested his earnings into the stock market and real estate, and quickly became rich. Although he becomes an accomplished man by all metrics, having amassed and established a family, he feels something is lacking. He remains unfulfilled and believes the cause might be something he had lost during his boyhood... Shimamoto Shimamoto appeared while Hajime feels inferior as the only child in his family. They were 12 years old when they met, and she was like a ray of sunshine to open Hajime‚Äòs heart. Shimamoto was a very pretty girl but polio has left her lame, even though Hajime still thought she was very pretty and different from others. The solitary Hajime encountered with Shimamoto who also came from a one-child family and found that there were many common points between each other. However they soon became good friends whom could share their secrets with each other. They spend long afternoons in her living room listening to Liszt and Nat King Cole on her father's prized new stereo, and talking with a pre-adolescent openness that becomes erotic only in retrospect. They were in a delicately poised relationship and had a period of pure and amused time. Shimamoto saved Hajime and gave a great support to his unbearable isolated world. For Hajime, Shimamoto‚Äôs existence was not just the end of the loneliness, more importantly he found the resonance of the mind from her. Shimamoto filled the missing sense of his life, she was the indispensable existence. They separated when entering junior high-school and moved to different areas. Dramatically, they met each other at 36 years old again. Hajime is catapulted into the past unreservedly but Shimamoto suddenly left him without a word after they spent a night together. Shimamoto is a beautiful, intense and mysterious woman; we don‚Äôt know any background of her later life. We know that she had a baby who died in infancy. She was single, not working, but had a very decent quality of life. Yukiko Yukiko was married to Hajime at her age of 30. But Hajime rarely mentioned her in the 6 years‚Äô marriage life as a husband, until he met Shimamoto again at his age of 36. The author only slightly mentioned her. However, the image of Yukiko as a wife is still pale. Until the end of story, Yukiko as a woman and a wife had the first initial conversation with Hajime, while he feels helpless since Shimamoto left. Her figure was clearly fleshed out, and played a vital role in the end of the story, such as she pointed out Hajime is egocentric, and he only pays attention to his own feelings while ignoring other people's feelings, especially her psychological process in the marriage life. In addition, she has been acting as a traditional wife who always listen to her husband, but suddenly standing in a strong position in the end and lecture the husband how to be a better man. She is the person who can love and light up others in love, and only her love is not destructive in this novel. Her husband's betrayal once made her desperate, however she returned to love and opened her heart to accept her husband.  Historical background  Hajime, born in 1951, belongs to the first birth tide of Japanese post-war. At that time the aftermath of war is almost nonexistent. Japan has just recovered from the rubble and entering the high-speed development period, but lacking of laborers and material resources. Therefore, the State encourages people to have children to build their homes. Most families had at least two or three children and middle-class families who have only one child such as Hajime are rare. Hajime is forlorn being the only child without any siblings, and therefore develops a relationship with books and music in his childhood. This situation and people‚Äôs prejudice affect him personally establishing a little solitary and obsessive view of the world. Background Murakami wrote the novel in 1992 while he was a visiting scholar at Princeton University. The English translation, by Philip Gabriel, was released in 1999. Part of the title, 'South of the Border,' refers to the song as sung by Nat King Cole. However, there is no evidence that Nat King Cole actually ever recorded this song. The other half refers to an Inuit syndrome called Piblokto or Arctic (or Siberian) hysteria. Plot synopsis The novel tells the story of Hajime, starting from his childhood in a small town in Japan. Here he meets a girl, Shimamoto, who is also an only child and suffers from polio, which causes her to drag her leg as she walks. They spend most of their time together talking about their interests in life and listening to records on Shimamoto's stereo. Eventually, they join different high schools and grow apart. They are reunited again at the age of 36, Hajime now the father of two children and owner of two successful jazz bars in Aoyama, the trendy part of Tokyo. With Shimamoto never giving any detail as to her own life and appearing only at random intervals, she haunts him as a constant \\"What if\\". Despite his current situation, meeting Shimamoto again sets off a chain of events that eventually forces Hajime to choose between his wife and family or attempting to recapture the magic of the past.

Charlotte Rhead was born into an artistic family. Her father Frederick Alfred Rhead began his career as an apprentice at Mintons where he learnt the art of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te ceramic decoration from Marc-Louis Solon. Frederick A. Rhead went on to work at a number of potteries including a failed venture of his own. Charlotte's mother Adolphine (n√©e Hurten) also came from an artistic family. Charlotte's elder brother, Frederick Hurten Rhead, became a well-known pottery designer in the USA. Career At the beginning of the twentieth century the Rhead family was living in Fenton where Charlotte and her sister Dollie studied at Fenton School of Art. Charlotte started work at Wardle and Co, a pottery in the nearby town of Hanley, where her brother Frederick was art director before emigrating to the USA in 1902. Charlotte did not stay at the firm long but it gave her the opportunity to develop her skills as a tubeliner, which would be useful to her in her future career as a designer. In 1905 Charlotte found employment as an enameller at Keeling & Co of Burslem.Charlotte Rhead Bio from English Pottery Website She was next employed as a designer at a tile-maker, T & R Boote. In 1912 Charlotte's father was appointed art director of Wood and Sons, a firm which operated several potteries. Charlotte joined him there, taking charge of the tubeliners, and later working as a designer. Charlotte is perhaps best known for her association with Burgess and Leigh of Middleport, where she worked as a designer from 1926 until 1931. (Their factory is still operating, as at 2014, as the Burleigh Pottery). In the 1930s she moved to the firm of AG Richardson in Tunstall. Their brand name was Crown Ducal. Charlotte Rhead's potter's mark. Legacy Rhead is noted for her cheerful tubelined designs. Her style was more traditional than that of Clarice Cliff and Susie Cooper, her contemporaries. Rhead's ware was popular in her lifetime, and continues to fetch moderate prices at auction.Rhead family collection brings unrecorded wares to the market Jessie Tait, another prolific ceramic designer, worked for Charlotte Rhead. The leading authority on the Rhead family was Bernard Bumpus (1921‚Äì2004) who curated an exhibition about the Rhead family, Rhead Artists and Potters, which toured various UK museums in the 1980s. Bumpus's publications include Charlotte Rhead: Potter and Designer, 1987. Media attention In 1985 Rhead, Clarice Cliff, and Susie Cooper were the subject of Pottery Ladies, a series of TV documentaries made for Channel 4 with the support of the Arts Council of Great Britain.

It is operated by South Western Railway (SWR) and also served by Great Western Railway (GWR). History Railways in SalisburyThree railway station sites have been used in Salisbury, owned by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) from 1847 and the Great Western Railway (GWR) from 1856, as well as two further stations at Wilton, west. =London and South Western Railway= The original LSWR station The new building of 1902 The LSWR opened their Milford station on the east side of the city on 1 March 1847, with the opening of their branch line from Eastleigh, near Southampton, to passenger traffic. This was the city's only railway until 30 June 1856, when the GWR opened the Salisbury branch from Westbury. On 1 May 1857, the LSWR opened the extended main line from London and Andover, at first to the Milford station. On 2 May 1859, the LSWR opened a station on the south side of the 1856 GWR station, west of Fisherton Street, to coincide with the opening of the first section of the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway. At the same time, the terminus of the Andover line moved to the new station, having been brought across the city, partly through a tunnel. The building is largely of two stories and has a central main entrance; the architect was Sir William Tite, who was responsible for a number of LSWR stations. As the GWR and LSWR used different gauges, through goods traffic had to be unloaded and transhipped in a transfer shed; a covered footbridge was opened in 1860 linking the two stations, to allow passengers to change trains. The LSWR station had a single long platform served by trains in both directions and a second bay platform was provided at the London end. In the 1870s the LSWR opened a second platform, east of Fisherton Street, for services towards London; it had an entrance from the street and was linked to the old platform by a subway, and there was another bay platform for trains to the east. The LSWR station was again enlarged between 1899 and 1902, and the 1870s platform east of Fisherton Street could then be closed. Two new platforms serving three tracks were opened between the GWR platforms and the original LSWR one, reached by a subway from the LSWR's new station offices, which were built in red brick on the west side of their original building of 1859. In the early morning of 1 July 1906, an overnight boat train derailed in Salisbury station, killing 24 passengers and 4 railwaymen. In 2008, the group of buildings (1859 and 1902) was designated as Grade II listed. =Great Western Railway= The former GWR station The GWR opened their broad gauge Salisbury branch line from on 30 June 1856. The terminus was on the west side of Salisbury on the west side of Fisherton Street. Isambard Kingdom Brunel provided a station with a wooden train shed to cover the tracks and a single- storey building of red brick with stone dressings to house booking offices and waiting rooms. The GWR converted their line to standard gauge in 1874, and four years later a connecting line was laid to the neighbouring 1859 LSWR station, which allowed wagons to be shunted between the two stations. In 1896 a through service between Cardiff on the GWR and Portsmouth on the LSWR began operating over a junction line at Salisbury. The two companies' lines ran alongside each other from Salisbury as far as Wilton (where they finally diverged although there was no connection between the lines there) until October 1973, when a new junction between the lines was put in at Wilton and the former GWR route closed. On 12 September 1932 the GWR's passenger trains were transferred to the LSWR station, and the two railways were in common ownership by British Railways from 1 January 1948. The train shed was demolished but Brunel's passenger buildings were designated as Grade II listed in 1972 and are in use as offices by non-railway businesses. Goods facilities The former Salisbury Milford station was used as a goods station until it was closed in 1967 and demolished in 1968.Griffiths p.43. Goods traffic was also handled in goods sheds at the west end of the Fisherton station ‚Äì north of the GWR station and south of the LSWR station ‚Äì and also on the Market House branch from the east end of the LSWR station which opened in 1859. A new LSWR marshalling yard was opened on the site of the old platform east of Fisherton Street after it had closed in 1902, but the main LSWR goods depot was kept at the old Milford station until 1967. The former GWR station remained in use as a goods depot until 1991. Motive power depots An engine shed, water tower and turntable were erected on the Milford site from January 1847, as the line was then open for freight traffic. A replacement engine shed was built by the LSWR at Fisherton Street in 1859. The GWR also built a small engine shed adjacent to their station in April 1858. This was demolished in 1899 to allow expansion of the LSWR station, and a replacement built on the north side of the line. This was closed by British Railways in 1950. A large new and well equipped engine shed was opened by the LSWR on 12 January 1901. This remained in use until the end of steam in southern England on 9 July 1967. The shed lay derelict for some years before being demolished. The sidings around the former GWR station were redeveloped in 1992 as Salisbury Traincare Depot, where South Western Railway maintain their fleet of DMUs. Description The approach road from the city is accessed from a junction on the south side of the railway bridge across Fisherton Street, which leads into a one-way car park with 287 spaces. The large building on the right of this approach is the old LSWR buildings of 1859, which now houses the Salisbury signal panel. Immediately next door is the red brick building of 1902, now the main entrance where the ticket office and buffet are located. The main platform adjacent to the entrance is platform 4 which is mainly used for trains towards Exeter and Cardiff, as is platform 3 opposite. This is one side of an island platform, the opposite side of which is platform 2 which is used by trains to London Waterloo and . Platform 5 is a bay platform at the west end which is no longer used by passenger trains. Terminal platform 6 is an eastwards extension of platform 4 and is predominantly used by London Waterloo trains terminating here, and local services to . Beyond platform 2 is another disused platform, formerly platform 1. Behind this are the sidings of the Traincare Depot; at the east end of this is an old water tank and the brick offices which once served the GWR station. Services South West Trains (left) and First Great Western (right) trains to Southampton Central South Western Railway operate half-hourly services to London Waterloo and hourly to . There is also an hourly circular service to via Southampton Central and limited services to or . In 2016 a new service began running once on summer Saturdays between London Waterloo and .

It is located in the northwestern part of the state of Chihuahua, on the Casas Grandes or San Miguel river, situated in a wide, fertile valley on the 4,000-foot Mesa del Norte of the Plateau of Mexico. Nearby is the Sierra Madre Occidental.  Population  As of 2010, the city of Nuevo Casas Grandes had a population of 55,553, up from 50,863 as of 2005. The city was founded in the 1870s. Nuevo Casas Grandes got its name from another town about a mile away called Casas Grandes. A train station was built in that area and soon people migrated near it. Many of the region's inhabitants were of Native American ethnic groups closely related to those of the American Southwest.  History  The area around Nuevo Casas Grandes is noted for its great historical and archaeological heritage. Five miles southwest of Nuevo Casas Grandes is the most important archaeological site in northern Mexico, the Casas Grandes or Paquim√© Archaeological Zone highlighted by the new Paquim√© (which, translated to Spanish, means \\"Big Houses\\" or Casas Grandes) Museum. Nuevo Casas Grandes is also world-famous for the nearby \\"potter village\\" of Mata Ortiz an ejido and its revival of pottery in the ancient Paquim√© tradition. Climate Nuevo Casas Grandes has a semi-arid climate with hot summers, mild winters and warm transition seasons. The location gets quite high summer rainfall and frequent air frosts in winter.  Culture  The city is the see city of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nuevo Casas Grandes. Nearby Nuevo Casas Grandes are Mennonite and Mormon communities. Both of those groups are bilingual with Spanish as their second language. However most of the Mormons in the region are of Mexican descent and speak Spanish as their mother tongue. The Mennonites are Old Colony Mennonites (not to be confused with Old Order Mennonites who live in Canada, the United States and Belize) and speak a German dialect called Plautdietsch as their primary language in addition to Standard German and Spanish, while those in the Mormon community are of American descent and speak English. As Nuevo Casas Grandes has grown in the last few decades, it now meets on the north side with the Mormon colony, Colonia Dubl√°n. Many who reside near Nuevo Casas Grandes endeavor to maintain orchards which grow a variety fruits, including peaches, apples, pears, and pecans. Shade and street trees include ash, cypress, deodar, eucalyptus, mulberry, pine, and sycamore. There is also significant activity in wheat and cattle. Nuevo Casas Grandes has an airport, Nuevo Casas Grandes, airport code NCG.

It lived during the Botomian and Toyonian stages (Olenellus-zone), , in what is currently North-America, part of the paleocontinent Laurentia. Life reconstruction of Olenellus thompsoni  Etymology  Olenellus fowleri was named in honor of Ed FowlerOlenellus means small Olenus, after a genus belonging to the Ptychopariida, to which the type species O. thompsoni was originally assigned. The name Olenus refers to a mythological figure who was turned to stone by the gods. The names of the species have the following derivations. * agellus comes from the Latin word for field or hamlet. * chiefensis refers to the Chief Range, which includes the Ruin Wash section, that holds the last of the Olenellina. * fowleri was named in honor of Ed Fowler, whose quarrying skills exposed the type locality of this species. * getzi is called after Noah L. Getz, on whose Lancaster estate several Olenellus species were first collected. * nevadensis refers to the state of Nevada, where this species is found. * parvofrontatus means ‚Äòsmall front‚Äô from the Latin words parvus and frontatus, indicating the short distance between the anterior border and the glabella in this species. * roddyi was named in honor of Dr. H. Justin Roddy (1856-1943), an internationally known naturalist, curator and professor of geology. * romensis refers to the Rome Formation. * terminatus is from the Latin terminus, meaning final, indicating the demise of the Olenellus lineage.  Taxonomy  Relationship within the Olenellidae = Olenellus is the only genus currently recognised in the subfamily Olenellinae. The sister group called the Mesonacinae consists of the genera Mesonacis and Mesolenellus.Olenellus fowleri collected from the Pioche Shale, Lincoln County, Nevada. = Status of the clade \\"Paedeumias\\" = \\"Paedeumias\\" was previously regarded as a genus related to Olenellus or a subgenus being part of Olenellus. Recent analysis shows that there is a group of species formerly assigned to Olenellus (Paedeumias) nested within Olenellus (O. clarki, O. nevadensis, O. parvofrontatus, O. roddyi and O. transitans). However, this group is more closely related to the majority of the remainder of Olenellus species than to O. agellus and O. romensis. This implies that either two new monophyletic subgenera need to be erected, or Olenellus (Paedeumias) and Olenellus (Olenellus) need to be dropped as subgenera, the latter being proposed by Lieberman. = Reassigned species = * O. alabamensis = Fremontella halli * O. altifrontatus = Bolbolenellus altifrontatus * O. argentus pl. 40, fig 12, 13, 15, 16, non fig. 14 = Grandinasus argentus * O. argentus pl. 40, fig 14, non fig. 12, 13, 15, 16 = Holmiella falx * O. bondoni = Fallotaspis bondoni * O. bonnensis = Mesonacis bonnensis * O. brevoculus = Mesonacis bonnensis * O. broegeri = Callavia broegeri * O. bristolensis = Bristolia bristolensis * O. bristolensis p. 8\\\\. fig 1-11, non pl. 7, fig 1, 2, 5 = Bristolia harringtoni * O. bufrontis = Bolbolenellus sphaerulosus * O. callavei = Callavonia callavei * O. cylindricus = Mesonacis cylindricus * O. eagerensis = Mesonacis eagerensis * O. euryparia = Bolbolenellus euryparia * O. forresti = Redlichia forresti * O. fremonti pl. 15, fig. 18 = Bristolia fragilis * O. fremonti pl. 37, fig. 1, 4-5 = Bolbolenellus euryparia * O. fremonti pl. 37, fig. 1-2 = Mesonacis fremonti * O. georgiensis, p. 220, pl. 5, fig. 7, non fig. 6 = Mesonacis vermontanus * O. gigas = Andalusiana cornuta * O. gilberti = Bristolia bristolensis * O. groenlandicus = Bolbolenellus groenlandicus * O. halli = Fremontella halli * O. hamoculus = Mesonacis hamoculus * O. hermani = Bolbolenellus hermani * O. hyperboreus = Mesolenellus hyperboreus * O. insolens = Bristolia insolens * O. intermedius = Fritzolenellus lapworthi or F. reticulatus * O. kentensis = Bolbolenellus groenlandicus * O. lapworthi = Fritzolenellus lapworthi * O. laxocules = Elliptocephala laxocules * O. logani = Elliptocephala logani * O. mickwitzi = Schmidtiellus mickwitzi mickwitzi * O. mohavensis = Bristolia mohavensis * O. multinodus = Nephrolenellus multinodus * O. paraocules = Elliptocephala paraocules * O. praenuntius = Elliptocephala praenuntius * O. reticulatus = Fritzolenellus reticulatus * O. sequomalus = Elliptocephala sequomalus * O. sphaerulosus = Bolbolenellus sphaerulosus * O. svalbardensis = Mesolenellus svalbardensis * O. terranovicus = Mesonacis bonnensis * O. torelli = Schmidtiellus mickwitzi torelli * O. truemani = Elliptocephala walcotti * O. truemani = Fritzolenellus truemani * O. truncatooculatus = Mummaspis truncatooculatus * O. vermontanus = Mesonacis vermontanus * O. walcottanus = Wanneria walcottana  Distribution  Olenellus gilberti Olenellus roddyi O. thompsoni is found in the middle Upper Olenellus-zone of Vermont (Franklin County, Parker Slate, Georgia).

Description  Olenellus chiefensis-cephalon Olenellus clarki Olenellus nevadensis Olenellus terminatus As with most early trilobites, Olenellus has an almost flat exoskeleton, that is only thinly calcified, and has crescent-shaped eye ridges. As part of the suborder Olenellina, Olenellus lacks dorsal sutures. Like all other members of the superfamily Olenelloide, the eye-ridges emerge from the back of the frontal lobe (L4) of the central area of the cephalon, that is called glabella. Olenellus also shares the typical character of whole family Olenellidae that the frontal (L3) and middle pair (L2) of lateral lobes of the glabella are partially merged. This creates two very typical, isolated slits. It can be distinguished from the other two genera in the family, Mesolenellus and Mesonacis, because the angle in the back rim of the cephalon is less than 15¬∞, making the head approximately semi-circular. The genal spines are reaching back no further than the 6th thorax segment, making them 4-5 times as long as the most backward lobe of the glabella (occipital ring or L0)1. The thorax is 4-4¬Ω times wider that the axis, measured at the 3rd segment. The base of the spine on the 15th thorax segment is almost as wide as the axis itself.  Key to the species  This key is based on Lieberman (1999), which describes only part of the species that are recognized today. { - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  1  width=\\"97%\\" Frontal lobe of the glabella (L4) rounded. ‚Üí 2 - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  -  width=\\"97%\\" L4 pointed anteriorly. ‚Üí Olenellus chiefensis - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  2  width=\\"97%\\" The frontal lobe of the glabella (L4) is connected with the border surrounding the cephalon with a short ridge on the midline (the so- called ‚Äúplectrum‚Äù). ‚Üí 3 - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  -  width=\\"97%\\" Plectrum absent. ‚Üí 8 - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  3  width=\\"97%\\" Frontal lobe of the glabella (L4) as wide as, or narrower than, the occipital ring (L0). ‚Üí 4 - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  -  width=\\"97%\\" L4 wider than L0. ‚Üí Olenellus agellus - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  4  width=\\"97%\\" Ocular lobe with a prominent furrow along the entire margin. ‚Üí 5 - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  -  width=\\"97%\\" Furrow only present at the anterior margin of the ocular lobe. ‚Üí 7 - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  5  width=\\"97%\\" The area outside the eye lobe (or extraocular area) is prominently flattened.

BiographyEarly life= A son of renowned Croatian actor Boris Dvornik and Dijana Dvornik (n√©e Tomiƒá), Dino Dvornik was born in Split, SFR Yugoslavia. He and his elder brother, Dean, would play alongside their father in mainstream 1970s movies and TV shows in Yugoslavia. These included Na≈°e malo misto (Our Little Place), Mater (Mother) (1976), Hajduƒçka vremena (Daredevil's Time) (1977), Priko sinjeg mora (Over the Great Sea) (1979) as well as the TV show Ljubav je hleb s devet kora (Love Is a Bread with Nine Crusts) (1990) and what was to be his final appearance, Ta divna splitska noƒá (A Wonderful Night in Split) (2004) by director Arsen A. Ostojiƒá, a movie which achieved many honors at various film festivals. In August 1989, Dino Dvornik married Danijela (n√©e Kulji≈°), with whom he had a daughter, Ella, who is a singer. =Career= Dino was best known to the public as a musician, more so than an actor, as he only took sporadic forays into acting over the years. His music had originally made him famous, earning him wide popularity across the regions of the former Yugoslavia. In the early 1980s, Dino and his brother Dean founded Kineski zid (Chinese wall or Great wall), a pop band named after the building in which the Dvornik family lived at that time in Split. It was the first domestic funk record released in Yugoslavia. He had been a perfectionist by reputation, who would lock himself in the studio for months. However, differences between the interests of the band members and the public led the band to an early breakup. Dvornik's influences included James Brown, Stevie Wonder and other funk artists. His unique style of music earned him the monikers \\"King of Funk\\" and \\"Funk Daddy\\". Dino was also known for his changing haircuts and his taste for stylish and trendy clothes. He was a born entertainer, who would keep his fans amused during and in between songs, making sure nobody would leave his shows unhappy. =Wider success and personal feedback= Dvornik had been emerging on the Yugoslav music scene when the war broke out. Privately, he had been praised by many for his honesty, and friendship in the true sense of the word, and he also had fans all over the world, particularly amongst people originating from the former Yugoslavia. Dvornik would play shows all over Europe and in the U.S. His biggest hit amongst many, arguably, is \\"Afrika\\" (taken from the album \\"Enfant terrible\\" (1997). His down-to-earth, endearing attitude was much appreciated by his fans. Dino was described as being friendly to all, often walking and living his life in full public view; never turning away from the attention of fans, and even joining them socially in the bars and caf√©s. His popularity was built on a combination of intelligent song lyrics and energetic, wild stage performances. In this early stage of his career, he chose his haircut and outfit to resemble Morrissey from The Smiths. At Zagreb Fest in 1988 Dino first made a name for himself when he received the award for best debutant for his song \\"Tebi pripadam\\" (I Belong To You). The very same year, he released his first solo album, self-titled \\"Dino Dvornik\\" followed by \\"Kreativni nered\\" (Creative Disorder) in 1989. Both became huge hits and made him a superstar in short time. After two other good albums, a studio and a live album, which went unnoticed because of the war in his country, Dino finally switched from funk to house music in the mid 1990s. His best-known song from that period is an ode to his hometown Split, Ni≈°ta kontra Splita, which he performed at the prestigious Split Music Festival in 1995, and eventually he won the main award for it. Dino released \\"Enfant Terrible\\" in 1997, his best selling and most awarded album to date. He has won several Porins, the most famous Croatian music award. Although he loved his hometown Split, he was living mainly in the Croatian capital of Zagreb for professional reasons. Dino was a supporter of Croatian football giants Hajduk Split. Dvornik frequently expressed that the breakup of Yugoslavia had consequences on his album sales, since the market decreased and people focused on other music styles and different artists in their new originated countries during and after the war. He stood his ground on a smaller market against people who thought he was too unpredictable. The quality of his music always managed to prevail obstacles like these during his career. He would rearrange parts on his tracks until everything was the way he thought was well enough to be shared with his fans. Dvornik was always anxious for his albums to be produced in high standard quality, something he was famous for ever since his early days in music. His most notable collaborations with other music artists in his country include those with Croatian music diva Josipa Lisac, and his Montenegrin counterpart and close friend, Rambo Amadeus. In his last years, Dvornik would often get behind the turntables and deejay in various clubs. =Later years= Over the years he became the subject of the media spotlight for allegedly struggling with substance abuse. He made several attempts at drug withdrawal and even though he succeeded each time, he admitted that the drugs had ruined his health and made his life a mess. Although he was a caring husband and loving father, he would still attend parties. Dino tended to create a warm atmosphere wherever he went, putting people instantly in a good mood. There have been many rumors about Dino Dvornik, mostly about his substance abuse and other shocking incidents such as apparently urinating on jury members from a gallery at an award show in the late 1990s as he did not approve with their selection of artists to be honored. At a similar public event he was spotted running around in underwear to state his disgust towards the hypocrisy and petty bourgeoisie of some people attending the show. In 2004 he starred in the movie A Wonderful Night in Split portraying a Split drug lord. The same year he became one of the first Croatian celebrities to start writing his own blog. He was later joined by his wife and his modelling daughter in doing so. In 2006, he and his family became the stars of a Croatian reality show, Dvornikovi (The Dvorniks), an entertaining show in the manner of The Osbournes. In 2008, Dino was working on his forthcoming album, Pandorina kutija (Pandora's Box). The album was nearing completion. He had already released the first single for the summer, Hipnotiziran (Hypnotized). The album is due for release in October 2008. =Death= On 7 September 2008, just 18 days following the celebration of his 44th birthday, Dino died in his bed. He had overdosed and was also severely depressed. The police conducted an on-site investigation and found many anti-depressants in the house. His wife Danijela found him dead in bed in their apartment at 11:00 am. Three days later, Dino was buried at the Mirogoj cemetery in Zagreb.  Discography  * 1989. Dino Dvornik * 1990.

Background  It is not known when Du Xian was born.However, Du was said to be in his 60s when he died in 740, and thus, based on the Chinese calculation of age, was born sometime between 672 and 681. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 98 . His family was from Pu Prefecture (ÊøÆÂ∑û, roughly modern Heze, Shandong) and claimed its ancestry from the Qin Dynasty general Du He (), and traced itself to a line of officials during Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty. It was said that the clan's members were on such good terms that it did not divide for five generations down to Du Xian. Both Du Xian's grandfather Du Yikuan () and father Du Chengzhi () were low level officials.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. Du Zhicheng died early in the reign of Wu Zetian. Du Xian, in his youth at that time, was said to be respectful and careful, and was particularly filially pious toward his stepmother and caring toward his half-brother Du Yu (). After he passed the imperial examinations, he became a military officer at Wu Prefecture (Â©∫Â∑û, roughly modern Jinhua, Zhejiang). When his term of office was complete, his subordinates, as a farewell gift, gave him 10,000 sheets of paper‚Äîthen a highly valuable commodity. He only accepted 100 and returned the rest. The witnesses commented, \\"In the past, there had been honest officials who only received gifts of a single large coin. This is similar.\\"This is a reference to the Han Dynasty official Liu Chong (ÂäâÂØµ), who, when he left his office as commandery governor, caused a group of seniors to come out of the mountains to thank him for his rule and attempt to give him 100 coins each as a gift. Liu, in response, selected only one coin from each. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 54. He later served as the sheriff of Zheng County (ÈÑ≠Á∏£, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), and was again known for his honesty. At that time, the official Yang Fu () was serving as the military advisor to the prefect of Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, roughly modern Weinan), which Zheng County belonged to, and was impressed with Du. Later, while Yang was serving as a judge at the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫, Dali Si), Du was accused of an offense. Yang commented, \\"If even this sheriff could be accused of a crime, how can we encourage officials to be clean and honest?\\" He informed this to his superiors and had Du made a Dali Pingshi () -- a judicial clerk.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  In 716, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, Du Xian was made Jiancha Yushi (), an imperial censor. On one occasion, there was a dispute between the deputy Protectorate General to Pacify the West Guo Qian'guan (), the general Liu Xiaqing (), and the Tang vassal Western Tujue's khan Ashina Xian. Emperor Xuanzong sent Du to the region to investigate the dispute. As part of his investigation, he visited the Tuqishi () tribe. A Tuqishi chieftain gave him gold as a gift. Du initially declined, but his subordinates pointed out that rejecting the gift might be viewed as an insult, so Du accepted it‚Äîand then buried it below the tent. After he left Tuqishi, he then sent messengers to the chieftain to inform him where the gold was buried. This impressed the Tuqishi chieftain. Du later served as imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong), but later left civil service to observe a mourning period when his stepmother died. In 724, then- Protectorate General to Pacify the West, Zhang Xiaosong (), was made the mayor of Taiyuan Municipality, and he recommended Du to replace him. Emperor Xuanzong recalled Du, while he was still in the mourning period, to serve as the deputy protectorate general, acting as the protectorate general. In 725, when the vassal king of Yutian, Yuchi Tiao (), was plotting with the local tribes to rebel against Tang. When Du found out, he attacked Yuchi Tiao, killed him, and placed a new king of Yutian on the throne. He was given the honorific title of Guanglu Daifu (). It was said that during Du's service as protectorate general, he cared greatly for the soldiers under him and worked hard, earning the love of both the Han Chinese and the non-Han. In fall 726, for his accomplishments, Du was recalled to the capital Chang'an, and, while he continued to be titularly protectorate general, remained at Chang'an to serve as chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). However, he was also responsible for an incident that damaged the relationship with Tuqishi‚Äîas the khan of Tuqishi, Sulu (), had married the daughter of a prior Western Tujue khan, Ashina Huaidao, and Emperor Xuanzong created her the Princess Jiaohe. When Princess Jiaohe sent messengers and 1,000 horses to Du's headquarters to sell horses, the messengers read of an order from her, as princess‚Äîand Du responded by angrily stating, \\"How dare an Ashina woman issue me an order?\\" He caned the messengers and detained the horses, which largely died in a few subsequent snowstorms. In late 726, after Du left his office, Sulu attacked, causing much damage, and Sulu withdrew only after he heard that Du had been made chancellor. By 729, Du was having repeated disagreements with fellow chancellor Li Yuanhong, and the senior chancellor Yuan Qianyao was unable to moderate them. This drew Emperor Xuanzong's displeasure with them, and he removed all three of them, replacing them with Yuwen Rong and Pei Guangting, while retaining fellow chancellor Xiao Song. Du was demoted to be the secretary general at Jing Prefecture (ËçäÂ∑û, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei). He later successively served as prefect of Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei) and mayor of Taiyuan Municipality. In 732, when Emperor Xuanzong visited Taiyuan, he made Du the minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu), and had Du accompany him back to Chang'an. Subsequently, when Emperor Xuanzong visited Luoyang, Du was left in charge of Chang'an. In Emperor Xuanzong's absence, Du conscripted soldiers to repair the three main palaces and the city walls, personally attending to the projects without rest. Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict thanking him for his diligence. Later, Du was made the minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu) and created the Marquess of Wei County. It was said that Du was honest but without sufficient knowledge, and often spoke in vulgar terms. Ever since his youth, he made a vow not to accept gifts, and when Du died in 740, he was given posthumous honors, but while his son Du Xiaoyou () accepted the imperial bestowments, he declined all gifts from Du's colleagues and subordinates. There was a dispute over his posthumous name, as the ministry of worship initially suggested Zhensu (Ë≤ûËÇÖ, meaning \\"faithful and stern\\"), while the officials Liu Tongsheng () and Wei Lian () believed that Du was both faithful to the state and filially pious and should be given a greater posthumous name signifying both virtues. The imperial scholar Pei Zong () believed that that was inappropriate, pointing out that Du came out of the period of mourning to take an office and thus, in Pei's opinion, could not be considered sufficiently filially pious. After Du Xiaoyou submitted a petition to Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong had the matter reexamined, and eventually, Du Xian was given the posthumous name of Zhenxiao (Ë≤ûÂ≠ù, meaning \\"faithful and filial\\").

His wife was called Liu (died in 784). He was known for his bluntness and honesty.  Background  Han Xiu was born in 672, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. His family was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an and traced its ancestry to the royal house of the Warring States period state Han. It also claimed, as ancestors, a line of officials during Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, Sui Dynasty, and Tang. Han Xiu's grandfather Han Fu (ÈüìÁ¨¶) served as a prefectural prefect during Tang, and Han Xiu's father Han Dazhi (ÈüìÂ§ßÊô∫) served as a census official at the eastern capital Luoyang. Han Xiu's uncle Han Damin (ÈüìÂ§ßÊïè) was a more-known official who, during the early reign of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian, refused to falsely implicate the official Li Xingbao (ÊùéË°åË§í), and ultimately, when Wu Zetian executed Li Xingbao anyway, was forced to commit suicide. Han Xiu was known for his literary abilities and knowledge, and after he passed the imperial examinations, he was made the secretary general of Taolin County (Ê°ÉÊûó, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). During the second reign of Emperor Gaozong's and Wu Zetian's son Emperor Ruizong, Emperor Ruizong's son and crown prince Li Longji (the later Emperor Xuanzong) was personally examining a number of recommended junior officials.As Li Longji was crown prince from 710 to 712, this event must occurred during those years. Han and Zhao Dongxi (Ë∂ôÂÜ¨Êõ¶) received the highest ratings, and Han was promoted to be Zuo Bujue (Â∑¶Ë£úÈóï), a low level official at the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). He was subsequently made Zhujue Yuanwailang (‰∏ªÁàµÂì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu). He subsequently successively served as Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng); and deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang), where he was in charge of drafting imperial edicts.Han might have served in some of these offices during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, but his biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang did not contain sufficient time references for that determination. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 98 and New Book of Tang, vol. 126 .  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  In 724, while Han Xiu was still serving as deputy minister of rites, he was, as a part of Emperor Xuanzong's attempts to increase the prestige of the prefectural prefects by selecting officials with good reputations to serve, sent to Guo Prefecture (Ëô¢Â∑û, in modern Sanmenxia). Guo Prefecture was positioned between Chang'an and Luoyang, and as the emperor often travelled between the two capitals, it was often disturbed by the size of the imperial train and often was required to carry out labor. Han thus requested a tax exemption for the people of the prefecture‚Äîwhich the chancellor Zhang Shuo initially rejected. Han repetitioned for the exemption. When his subordinates warned him that this might offend Zhang, Han responded: Han's petition was eventually accepted. After about a year, he left civil service to observe a mourning period for his mother, and at his insistence, was allowed to serve out the three-year period. After the mourning period was over, he was recalled to serve as the deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang) and was again in charge of drafting edicts. Subsequently, he was promoted to be Shangshu You Cheng (Â∞öÊõ∏Âè≥‰∏û), one of the secretaries general for the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). In 733, after the chancellor Pei Guangting died, Emperor Xuanzong asked Pei's fellow chancellor Xiao Song for a recommendation. Xiao was set to recommend his friend Wang Qiu (Áéã‰∏ò), but Wang declined and recommended Han instead. Xiao, believing Han to be meek and easy to control, recommended Han. Emperor Xuanzong thus made Han the Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau, and gave him the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. Despite Xiao's hopes to dominate his junior colleague, Han turned out to be stern and not bending simply to Xiao's will, impressing the senior official Song Jing with his determination. It was also said that he was willing to speak bluntly, sometimes offending Emperor Xuanzong but earning his respect. On one occasion, when Li Meiyu (ÊùéÁæéÁéâ) the sheriff of Wannian County (Ëê¨Âπ¥, one of the two counties making up Chang'an) was accused of an offense unspecified in historical accounts. Emperor Xuanzong ordered that Li be exiled to the Lingnan region. Han responded: Emperor Xuanzong initially refused, but Han spoke further: Emperor Xuanzong, impressed with Han's blunt talk, agreed. It was also said that whenever Emperor Xuanzong was being overly pleasure-seeking or wasteful in the palace, he would turn to his servants and ask, \\"Do you think Han Xiu knows this?\\" and that soon thereafter, a petition would arrive from Han urging him to change the behavior. It was also said that when one of the servants made the comment, \\"Since Han Xiu became chancellor, Your Imperial Majesty has become thinner and thinner. Why not send him away?\\" Emperor Xuanzong responded: (The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang, however, doubted the truth about Han's timely petitions and also the extent of Emperor Xuanzong's respect for him, pointing out that, at that time, leaking the news about the events in the palace was considered a major offense.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 51 [733].) Emperor Xuanzong gave Han the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (ÈäÄÈùíÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´). However, soon, Han drew Emperor Xuanzong's displeasure by repeatedly criticizing Xiao, leading to Xiao's offering to retire. Emperor Xuanzong, touched by Xiao's tearful request, removed both from chancellor positions later in 733 and made Han the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu). In 736, Han was made an advisor to Li Ying the Crown Prince and created the Viscount of Yiyang. He died in 739 and was given posthumous honors. He was buried in Guozhuang Tang tomb. His sons Han Hao (ÈüìÊµ©), Han Qia (ÈüìÊ¥Ω), Han Hun (ÈüìÊ∏æ), Han Hong (ÈüìÊ¥™), Han Hong (ÈüìÊ±Ø, note different character than his brother), Han Huang, and Han Hui (ÈüìÊ¥Ñ) all served as officials, and Han Huang was particularly powerful as a regional governor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong and briefly served as chancellor.

He is considered one of the most influential designers of the Art deco style. Life Murray was born in the Auckland suburb of Mount Eden. His father, Charles Henry Murray was from Scotland and his mother Lilian Day (n√©e George) was from Nelson, New Zealand. Murray was first educated at King's College in Remuera. The family emigrated to England when he was 14, and from 1906 to 1907 he attended Mill Hill School, London. He served as an officer with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force during the First World War, and was awarded the Military Cross for \\"conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on numerous occasions\\" in 1918, and the Belgian Croix de Guerre in 1919. Following the war, Murray graduated from the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London in 1921 and that year was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. However a lack of work forced him to make a living as an illustrator for magazines. In 1928 he held his own show at the Lefevre Gallery in London but this was not to prove his passion. His visits to exhibitions such as the 1925 Paris Exposition and the 1931 Exhibition of Swedish Industrial Art in London inspired Murray to seek out opportunities to design vases and tablewares for factory production, and as the depression of the early 1930s further reduced the demand for architecture he became a full-time designer. Murray first approached Arthur Marriott Powell about the possibility of working in Whitefriars Glass in London. Though his ideas proved unsuitable for their style of glass, he worked as a freelance designer at Stevens & Williams of Brierley Hill in the West Midlands in 1932. The trial pieces were shown in London that year and the 'Keith Murray range' was produced. Between 1932 and 1939 he produced over 1200 designs though many were only issued in quantities of six or twelve. In 1932 he also began working 2‚Äì3 months a year for Wedgwood. Josiah Wedgwood invited him to visit the Wedgwood Factory. He was then employed to produce designs for dinner and teaware. It is here that Murray's famous ribbing designs began to form. His first range was entitled 'Annular'.Keith Murray Design for Life In 1934 the royal silversmiths Mappin & Webb approached him and asked if he could produce bowls and vases in silver working to the same designs as his Wedgwood pieces.Keith Murray Design for Life Most of his work was with vases, bowls and similar cylindrical ware, executed in a clean and restrained style with decoration often limited to deeply incised lines or smooth steps in the shape. The whole piece is usually one colour without applied decoration. From the beginning Murray's stature as a designer was recognised as every piece bore his signature above the Wedgwood mark. In 1936 Keith Murray was appointed architect in charge of designing the new Wedgwood factory at Barlaston, Staffordshire. At the start of the Second World War he returned to the RAF. Following the war he returned to architecture and left the field of industrial design. Murray's work sold well at the time and has become increasingly sought after.

Following monsoonal rains it may hold fresh water, but becomes more saline after a number of dry years. Location The lake is situated approximately south of Halls Creek near where the Tanami Desert meets the Great Sandy Desert. The nearest town is the Mulan Community located to the east of the lake shore. The boundaries of two pastoral leases also encompass parts of the lake; Billiluna Station to the north and Lake Gregory Station to the south. Lake Gregory is situated on the edge of Mulan Aboriginal Community, home to the Walmajarri people. It is a traditional site to the people, containing several culturally significant sites. The Paraku Indigenous Protected Area works with traditional owners and rangers to monitor and maintain the lake and its surroundings. Description The lake is about above sea level. The system includes an area of about that is subject to regular flooding within a much larger, approximately , paleolake bed. The depth of the lake can vary from . It lies at the far southwest extremity of the Tanami subregion of the Tanami Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia region. The Tanami subregion is composed mainly red Quaternary sandplains overlying Permian and Proterozoic strata that are exposed as hills and ranges around the area. Alluvial and lacustrine calcareous deposits occur throughout the subregion. In the north they are associated with Sturt Creek drainage and further south as part of the lake bed. The lake lies in the northeast Canning Basin, within the Gregory sub- basin and is underlain by almost of sedimentary rocks, ranging in age from Ordovician to mid-Triassic. The rocks are covered by alluvium and lacustrine sediments to a maximum thickness of approximately . The bed of the lake is clay with the formation of some salt and gypsum pans. The Lake Gregory System consists of several interconnected waterbodies and is fed primarily by Sturt Creek. The creek has a catchment area of approximately and flows north to south as a single channel until a short distance south of Halls Creek. After this, it breaks into an anastomosing channel system forming a series of shallow interconnected basins. The western tributary of Sturt Creek feeds into Rillya, Kurdu, Yuenbi and Bulbi Lakes. The eastern tributary discharges through Leira waterhole into Mulan Lake which is the largest lake and can remain full for several years following stream flow events. History The lake was once part of a inland sea some ten times larger than the current lake around 300,000 years ago. It is now part of a larger system of freshwater and salt water lakes fed by Sturt Creek. The waters of the lake are dependent on water coming in from the creek and from monsoonal rains. Water loss from the lake is due to evaporation and infiltration into the paleochannel. There is no outflow from the lake. The lake appeared as Gregory's Salt Sea on Alfred Canning's map of the area when he was surveying the Canning Stock Route. It was named to honour the explorer Augustus Gregory who traversed the area in 1856. The country around the lake and river systems provides an abundant source of plant and animal life that attracted the attention of the pastoral industry in the early 1900s. The Canning Stock Route, established in 1910 from Halls Creek south to the rail-head at Wiluna to drove cattle from the east Kimberley, runs down the western margin of the lake system. Lake Gregory Station covers and has a potential carrying capacity of 6,720 cattle. It had not operated as a cattle station from the 1980s to 2016 when it was acquired by the Aboriginal Land Trust. It has been sub-leased to the Yougawalla Pastoral Company. In 2001 the High Court of Australia formally recognised the Walmajarri peoples as the traditional owners of the area and awarded them native title over the land. A handover ceremony was conducted on the shores of the lake. Stone artefacts in situ in sediments recovered from an archaeological dig in 2008 at the Parnkupirti site at Lake Gregory, give optically stimulated luminescence age determinations of at least 37,000 years, making Lake Gregory among the oldest-known inhabited sites in Australia. Flora The sandplains around the lake support mixed shrub steppes of Hakea species, desert bloodwoods, a variety of Acacia and Grevillea species over soft spinifex hummock grasslands. Wattle scrub over soft spinifex hummock grass communities occur on the ranges of the area. The drainage lines of the creeks support ribbon and Flinders grasses and other short grasslands, often as savannas with stands of River red gums. Birds A pair of brolgas amongst other waterbirds in the Northern Territory The lake serves as a major migratory stop-over area for a variety of shorebirds. It also provides a major breeding habitat of several species of water birds, including cormorants and terns. It has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports over 1% of the world populations of hardheads, grey teals, pink-eared ducks, little black cormorants, brolgas, sharp-tailed sandpipers. It sometimes supports similarly important numbers of magpie geese, Pacific black ducks, freckled ducks and Oriental plovers, as well as providing habitat for Australian bustards. The lake regularly supports over 100,000 water birds, more than any other inland fresh water lake in Australia. In 1988 more than half a million water birds were recorded at the lake representing at least 67 different species.

Pann was an influential folklorist and collector of proverbs, as well as a lexicographer and textbook author.

Breviar de istorie a rromilor , at Romanothan.ro This view is also accepted by some Romanian authors. Various other interpretations state that Pantoleon Petrov, who died during Anton Pann's childhood, was Bulgarian, Aromanian, or Romanian. Gheorghe Adamescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. 1830-1835 The writer, who was the youngest of Petrov and Tomaida's three sons, eventually adopted the family name Pann, as a colloquial contraction of his father's given name. After he began primary education at the communal school in Sliven, the Petrovs fled the region during the Russo-Turkish War of 1806-1812 and settled in Chi≈üinƒÉu, Bessarabia, where Anton was first employed by a Russian Orthodox choir. His two brothers were killed in the skirmishes around BrƒÉila, as volunteers on the Imperial Russian side. Moving with his mother to Bucharest in 1810-1812, Pann would spend most of his life in the city. Anton Pann carried on with his choral activities in Wallachia, was employed as a sexton by the Romanian Orthodox Olari and Sfin≈£ilor Churches, before being tutored by the Greek musician Dionysios Foteinos (1777-1821) and allowed to attend the religious music school founded by Petros Ephesios (d. 1840). Perfecting his craft, he came to the attention of Metropolitan Dionisie Lupu, who appointed him on a commission charged with translating liturgical works from Slavonic to Romanian. The memoirist Ion Ghica later recounted that Pann attended the Saint Sava College, but this remains disputed. In 1820, he first married Zamfira Azgurean, in what was to be the first of his unhappy romantic liaisons. =Midlife= LƒÉutari in mid-19th-century Bucharest, as drawn by Carol Popp de Szathmary In 1821, when Tudor Vladimirescu's rebellious forces occupied the city, Pann fled to the Transylvanian city of Kronstadt (part of the Austrian Empire), and was employed as a cantor by the Saint Nicolas Church in the ethnic Romanian neighborhood of ≈ûchei. This temporary refuge over the Southern Carpathians mirrored that of other cultural and religious figures of the day, his fellow musician Macarie Ieromonahul among them. He also spent time in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea (1827), where he was a teacher at the Orthodox seminary and, in parallel, lectured on religious music to the nuns of the Dintr-un Lemn Monastery. A scandal erupted after Pann used his position at the latter institution to seduce Anica, the mother superior's 16-year-old niece. Unsuccessfully offering her legal guardians to marry Anica in church, he eloped with her back to ≈ûchei. While there, he became friends with the writer Ioan Barac, whom he had probably met earlier, and who, according to Pann's own testimony, gave him lessons in meter. According to some sources, he also took a trip to Buda. The literary critic Tudor Vianu attributes to Barac and Vasile Aaron, whose work constituted an adaption of various chanson de geste themes, the merit of having inspired Pann to pursue a literary career. Title page of \\"The Theoretical and Practical Basis of Church music or the Melodic Grammar\\", Bucharest, 1845. Copy in the library of Stavropoleos Monastery. Returning to R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea in 1828, he was officially expelled from his teaching position, and, in 1828, he returned to work as a cantor for the Bucharest school on Podul Mogo≈üoaiei. Over the following decade, Pann authored a large panel of musical and literary works, including Noul Doxastar, which, adapted and partly recreated from Dionisie Fotino's version, assembled all officially-endorsed pieces of Christian music, and which he prefaced. According to his own testimony, this had required a major financial effort, one which almost caused his bankruptcy. In 1837, he separated from Anica, with whom he had fathered a son (Gheorghi≈£ƒÉ) and a daughter (Tinca). Anton Pann married a third and final time in 1840, to Catinca (the more common name of Ecaterina). All three of his wives survived his death; his son by Zamfira, LazƒÉr, was to become an Orthodox priest. From 1842 to 1851, with support gained from Metropolitan Neofit, Pann was employed as a music teacher by the main seminary in Bucharest (in parallel, he continued to sing at the AlbƒÉ Church). During those years, he began associating with famous lƒÉutari of his day, and regularly attended the lively social gatherings held in the gardens and orchards of Mitropoliei Hill. A passionate collector of classical-Ottoman and Romani music, which formed the staple of the lƒÉutari repertory ever since the Phanariote period, Pann later printed some of the earliest manele tablatures. Olti≈£a C√Æntec, \\"Manelele, o realitate cu trecut istoric √Æn ≈£ƒÉrile rom√¢ne\\", in Evenimentul, June 30, 2001 Andrei Oi≈üteanu, \\"≈¢ara Me≈üterului Manele\\" , in Revista 22, Nr 29, July 2001 (hosted by Pruteanu.ro) This was matched by his interest in other musical traditions: in his churchly practice, he endorsed the tradition of Byzantine hymns and removed modulations of Levantine inspiration, while he was among the first of his generation to use modern notation and Italian markings for tempo. In 1843, Pann established a printing press inside the Olteni Church, which published works by several authors of his day, as well as a long series of almanacs. He later confessed that this enterprise had drained his economies, and that he had relied on support from various benefactors. Upon Neofit's request, he also began the translation of various religious texts. Pann's comprehensive and innovative textbook for music, Bazul teoretic ≈üi practic al muzicii biserice≈üti (\\"The Theoretical and Practical Basis of Church music or the Melodic Grammar\\"), was officially endorsed by the Metropolitan and taught at the seminary after 1845 and became a template for similar works; in addition, his printing shop sold cheap copies of popular novels, such as the Alexander Romance, the Book of 1001 Nights, the Book of Til Owl-Mirror, and the Story of Genevieve of Brabant. In March 1847, Anton Pann authored an account of the Great Fire of Bucharest. During the latter disaster, his printing shop was heavily damaged, and he was only able to salvage the presses. He resumed his activities only in 1849, when he moved the business to a house owned by Catinca Pann on Taurului Street. =Later years= The 1847 fire in Bucharest In 1848, he published a lexicon of words and expressions in Romanian, Russian and Ottoman Turkish. Later in the same year, Pann sided with the liberal revolutionaries in their action against Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, was a supporter of the new Wallachian Provisional Government, participating in popular rallies in Craiova and R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea (see 1848 Wallachian revolution). The following year, after falling severely ill, he wrote down the first version of his testament in verse (Adiata), in which he asked to be buried in Vifor√¢ta Monastery (where he hoped that his wife Catinca would become a nun). After a series of other satirical works, Pann produced a collection of writings centered on the figure of Nastratin Hogea and owing inspiration to Balkan folklore at large (first published in 1853). In autumn 1854, Pann fell ill with typhus and the common cold during a visit to R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea, dying soon after at his Bucharest residence; he was buried in the Lucaci Church of Bucharest, although, in his second will of August, he had asked for his final resting place to be the hermitage of Rozioara (this failure to comply was attributed to the difficulties in transportation). Catinca Pann remarried soon after this. During the early 1900s, Lucaci Church became home to a monument in Pann's honor, donated by the General Association of Church Singers -- an institution presided over by Ion Popescu-PasƒÉrea. Literature Romanian Cyrillic (Sibiu, 1837) Pann's literary creation was noted for its reliance on a vast oral tradition, which he claimed to have codified, thus drawing comparisons to his predecessors Rabelais, Giovanni Boccaccio, and Miguel de Cervantes. The Romanian literary critic George CƒÉlinescu drew a direct comparison between Pann and his contemporary, the Wallachian Jewish peddler Cilibi Moise, who, without producing any written works, was made famous by a series of bitter puns in which he referred to himself in the third person (such as \\"For a few years now, Cilibi Moise has been begging Poverty to leave his house, at the very least for as long as it takes him to get dressed\\").George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. Compendiu, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1983: \\"Cilibi Moise\\", p.95 Together with Ion CreangƒÉ and Petre Ispirescu, Pann was among the first major interpreters of Romanian folklore in 19th-century literature. Appealing primarily to a semi-educated audience, his creations have been celebrated for their familiar tone and use of plain Romanian, during a period when literary language was beginning to rely on formalism and a large number of neologisms. The writer himself made frequent excuses to the more educated of his readers for any flaws they were to find in his texts, specifying that he lacked in formal training. In the final decades of his life, several of his printed works, especially Memorialul focului mare and the manele lyrics collection Spitalul amorului, came to be appreciated by a younger generation of boyars. The Moldavian poet Vasile Alecsandri noted, in an 1872 letter quoted by Garabet IbrƒÉileanu: \\"Anton Pann has not yet been appreciated to his full value, and moreover, in Wallachia his merits are even being held in contempt by most modern men of letters\\". Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, Spiritul critic √Æn cultura rom√¢neascƒÉ: Veacul al XIX-lea. Factorii culturii rom√¢ne≈üti din acest veac (wikisource) Pann's poetic language often relies on elaborate successions of images, metaphors, or maxims.George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. Compendiu, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1983: \\"Anton Pann\\", p.91-95 According to CƒÉlinescu, \\"the fundamental method\\" used by Pann is \\"the almost monstrous accumulation of aphorism, around an initial idea and through a very wide [process of] association\\", amounting to \\"a burlesque effect\\". He illustrated this view with a sample of proverb-lyrics: Almost all of Pann's work drew on recent or ancient sources, which he reinterpreted to suit the tastes of his public. In the 1880s, the scholar Moses Gaster revealed that one of Pann's major works, √én≈£eleptul Archir ≈üi nepotul sƒÉu Anadam (\\"The Wise Archir and His Nephew Anadam\\"), made ingenious use of an old and much-circulated biography of Aesop. In researching various fables which Pann had used to expand on his proverbs, Gaster noted that they echoed obscure medieval material (including the Gesta Romanorum, Giulio Cesare Croce's Le sottilissime astutie di Bertoldo, and even Siberian Turkic folklore). One of his main pieces, the fable of the mouse who pictures himself king of all animals, originated with the Panchatantra. Tudor Vianu indicated that, in writing his book on morals (Hristoitia), Pann integrated text from Desiderius Erasmus' Adagia. As an original element, Anton Pann used the diverse sources of his work to complement his own view of the world; according to Vianu, the latter's main traits were Pann's religious tolerance and fervor, as well as his Levantine outlook on social matters. CƒÉlinescu defined Povestea vorbei as \\"a false collection of folklore, given that Pann does not abide by peasant authenticity, but embellishes popular language with the cultured one, often obtaining an amazing chromatic effect\\". While commenting on Pann's focus on social developments of his time as \\"the completely mechanical ease with which current issues are put into verse\\", CƒÉlinescu noted that Hristoitia contained \\"advices which presume a state of supreme animality\\". In drawing the latter conclusion, he cited a stanza in which Pann asked people not to touch their genitalia in public. O ≈üezƒÉtoare la ≈£arƒÉ, believed to be one of Pann's most accomplished works, is written as an epic frame story in verse, and constitutes a satire of life in mid-19th century Wallachia. Reflecting the perspective of simple folk, the poem is marked by sarcastic remarks on social contrasts, Westernization, superstition, as well as tensions between estate lessors and workers (with the former stereotypically depicted as Greeks). Its final part, a denouement, went unpublished. O ≈üezƒÉtoare la ≈£arƒÉ was also noted for the lengthy and meticulously detailed conclusions to each story, which evidenced a style borrowed from traditional storytelling. Vianu argued that the poem stands as a Romanian equivalent to The Decameron, Till Eulenspiegel, or Simplicius Simplicissimus. The text itself later became a source for aphorisms: the colloquial expression ba e tunsƒÉ, ba e rasƒÉ (\\"it is either trimmed or razed\\"), which Pann originally made in reference to an irrelevant debate over the state of an orchard, has survived as a tongue-in-cheek view of arbitrary conclusions. Pann's influential taste for manele and their sentimental lyrics, as exemplified in his Spitalul amorului and other printed brochures, has been the target of criticism ever since the early 20th century. Tudor Vianu stressed that these works showed the influence of \\"the trivial popular music of his day\\", while CƒÉlinescu dismissed them as \\"lamented vulgarity and eroticism\\". Legacy The Anton Pann Memorial House in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea Anton Pann's portrait on a Romanian postage stamp (1955) Pann is generally believed to have authored the music to De≈üteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne!, Romania's national anthem. His associate Gheorghe Ucenescu is known to have arranged the melody to the lyrics of Andrei Mure≈üanu, Valer Rus, \\"Pentru o istorie a imnului na≈£ional\\" , at the Mure≈üanu Memorial House site but Pann's direct implication in the creative process was allegedly not confirmed by sources. According to one account, Ucenescu had used a romanza composed by Pann in 1839, in turn complementing the lyrics of Grigore Alexandrescu. It has also been argued that the music was that of a popular lied, and first published in one of Pann's manele collections. The ethnographic research carried out by Dimitrie Gusti confirmed that the same melody was being sung as a folk song by Southern Dobrujan ethnic Turks in the 1930s. Mihai Eminescu, one of Romania's most influential poets, made a reference to Pann in his poem Epigonii (1870), which, in its opening verses, traces the development of early literature and the impact of Romanticism. Cited alongside Dimitrie Cantemir, Dimitrie ≈¢ichindeal, Vasile C√¢rlova, IenƒÉchi≈£ƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu, Alexandru Sihleanu, Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, Cezar Bolliac and others, Pann is referred to as the son of Pepelea, the witty hero of folk literature, and complimented with the words \\"as clever as a proverb\\". Mihai Eminescu, Epigonii (wikisource) During the interwar period, the works of Anton Pann were reflected and complimented in the modernist poetic art of Ion Barbu.Tudor Vianu, Scriitori rom√¢ni, Vol III, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1971, p.419-421 Barbu's Nastratin Hogea la Isarl√¢k uses Pann's main character to tragic effect, depicting, in willing contrast to the proverbial setting, Nastratin's violent self-sacrifice. George CƒÉlinescu noted that Pann's \\"mix of buffoonery and seriousness\\" present in the works of poet Tudor Arghezi, came \\"in the line of Anton Pann\\".George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. Compendiu, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1983: \\"Anton Pann\\", p.91-95; \\"Tudor Arghezi\\", p.322 In 1945, Lucian Blaga authored a three-act play named Anton Pann, centered on the poet's ≈ûchei period. A museum of the life and activity of Anton Pann exist in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea, and, since 1990, a public theater in the same city bears his name.

History The first historical mention of Pirovac was in 1298, under the name \\"Zlosela\\". At that time, the village belonged to noblemen from Bribir -- the ≈†ubiƒá family, and later it became the property of the ≈†ibenik Diocese and noblemen from ≈†ibenik. The settlement itself was founded in the 15th century by refugees who fled from the Turks. Nevertheless, this area was inhabited many centuries earlier, as shown by remnants of Roman settlements found on the islet of Sveti Stjepan (St. Stephen). Many other historical monuments tell us about the gradual settlement and development of this place. The remnants of a Roman villa in Ivinj date back to the 1st AD. The site was proclaimed a cultural good in 2012 and awarded the status of a protected cultural monument.Ivinj Archeological Site, http://www.aquarius-online.com/en/amenities/ivinj-archeol-site/ The defence wall, erected around 1505 by Petar Draganiƒá, has been partly preserved in the village. The 1506 parish church of St. George was restored in Baroque style in the 18th century. The graveyard chapel of the Draganiƒá-Vranƒçiƒá family features a Gothic sarcophagus with a relief made in 1447 by Andrija Budƒçiƒá from ≈†ibenik and Lorenzo Pincino from Venice, according to the sketches by Giorgio da Sebenico (George the Dalmatian). Roman artifacts have been found on the islet of Sveti Stjepan in front of the village; here also are the ruins of a Franciscan monastery (from 1511), which was abandoned in 1807. By the mid-17th century, there were 25 houses in the village. The number of inhabitants rose from 273 in 1709 to 1970 in 1931. The first school was opened in 1885. The settlement's name was changed from Zlosela to Pirovac in 1921. The village of Ka≈°iƒá Banjevaƒçki in the municipality was home to a Partisan monument, which was destroyed during the Croatian War of Independence. In 2008, the village replaced the previous monument with a memorial chapel to the dead from both the Second World War and the War of Independence.

They connect the veins outside the cranium to the venous sinuses inside the cranium. They drain from the scalp, through the skull, into the larger meningeal veins and dural venous sinuses. Emissary veins have an important role in selective cooling of the head. They also serve as routes where infections are carried into the cranial cavity from the extracranial veins to the intracranial veins. There are several types of emissary veins including posterior condyloid, mastoid, occipital and parietal emissary vein. Structure There are also emissary veins passing through the foramen ovale, jugular foramen, foramen lacerum, and hypoglossal canal. Function Because the emissary veins are valveless, they are an important part in selective brain cooling through bidirectional flow of cooler blood from the evaporating surface of the head. In general, blood flow is from external to internal but the flow can be altered by increased intracranial pressure. Clinical significance One notable emissary vein, the Vein of Vesalius, travels through the sphenoidal emissary foramen inferior to the zygomatic arch, connecting the pterygoid plexus with the cavernous sinus. This is an important route for the spread of infection as cranial nerve VI and the internal carotid pass through the cavernous sinus, with cranial nerves III, IV, V1, and V2 passing alongside the lateral wall of the sinus. Subsequent infection or inflammation in the cavernous sinus can result in septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, with resultant damage to the cranial nerves contained within, as well as further spread of the infection leading to meningitis.

He recently hosted a news/information talk-show on Atlanta's WYAY NewsRadio 106.7 from 3:00PM to 6:00PM EST. The Show consisted of Peterson as host, Pete Davis as co-host/sports anchor/producer, Chad \\"The Hangman\\" Potier as associate producer/call screener and show engineer Jon Michael \\"Jon-Boy\\" Drain. From 1992 through 2006, he hosted a radio talk show on WGST-AM in Atlanta, Georgia. Formerly a United States Marine from 1966 to 1969, he served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War and was discharged as a sergeant. Before becoming a radio host, Peterson was a television anchor in Chicago and New Orleans. He was on rival news-talk station WSB before he came to WGST. After his firing from WSB Peterson would refer to his former employer as \\"WSOB\\" and \\"WBS\\" (and sometimes \\"We Suck and Blither\\"). Peterson was a donor for the Marine's Toys for Tots Christmas drive, and from 1997 to 2005 he produced a comedy bits CD, donating all the proceeds to the drive. In addition he hosted an annual charity golf tournament. Peterson is an avid motorcycle enthusiast. From December 2005 to May 5, 2006, members of Peterson's support team started to lose their positions at WGST. Jim Gossett, a voice impersonator who specialized in past presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and classic celebrities such as Johnny Carson, among others, quit his job in December 2005. Two months later, WGST-AM's sports director, Pete Davis, was fired for reasons not publicly disclosed. A final firing among Peterson's team was on May 5, when his producer, Wayne Kitchens, was terminated. Kitchens told an online media outlet (Buzz) that management was upset when he didn't bleep out an anti-Muslim statement Peterson said on the air the week prior to his firing. Kitchens has speculated that the firings were an attempt to force Peterson to quit. Peterson's final broadcast for WGST was on November 20, 2006. The station announced the next day that he was no longer on the air.  The Kimmer Show  The Kimmer Show is an afternoon radio talk show on Atlanta's WYAY Talk 106.7 radio station hosted by Peterson, and featuring Pete \\"Snake\\" Davis, Chad \\"Hangman\\" Potier, and John-Boy. The show was formerly broadcast on the WGST AM radio station (640 kHz) in Atlanta. Peterson referred to himself as \\"The Stain\\" after being called that by an angry listener named Rick. Peterson was known for giving other hosts nicknames, such as Tom Hughes (\\"The King\\", fellow broadcaster who hosted AM-Atlanta on WGST), Sam Memmolo \\"Shadetree Mechanic\\", host of a weekend radio show on WGST, Stu Klitenic (\\"The Bank Robber\\", baseball radio pre-game and post-game announcer for the Atlanta Braves), Mark Lemke (\\"The Lemmer\\", former Second baseman for the Atlanta Braves who is now pre-game and post-game radio announcer for the baseball club), Dave McBride (\\"Mac the Mechanic\\", works with Memmolo on his weekend radio program), Gene Henssler (\\"Dr. Gene, The Money Machine\\", chair of the Henssler Group, a financial-consulting firm in the metro Atlanta area). He referred to former morning-show host Sean Hannity as \\"Hannie-pie\\" and \\"The Tin Man.\\" Peterson has been married and divorced twice, most recently from Elizabeth, an attorney whom he referred to on air as the \\"Fantasy Goddess.\\" WGST and Kim Peterson produced a \\"best-of\\" highlights audio CD of his show every year from 1996 to 2005. It was called \\"The Kimmer Komedy Klassics.\\" These featured the funniest spots, advertisements, commentaries, and \\"newsmaker-line\\" calls for that year. One year the CD included an additional DVD of the Kimmer roast event. The final CD was released in December 2005; it included a bonus disc with all 10 years of \\"Kimmer Komedy Klassics\\" in mp3 format. All CD sales profits were donated to the U.S. Marine Corps \\"Toys for Tots\\" program as part of the WGST yearly Christmas fund drive. In addition to scheduled segments, Peterson had regular listeners who frequently called in to his show. The group ranged from an outspoken liberal caller he referred to as \\"Commie Dave,\\" who was eventually given 60 seconds per week to rant, to Helper John and the police and truck drivers who called in just to say \\"hello.\\" Peterson's regular staff included producer Wayne (\\"No Offense!\\") Kitchens, who later worked for Eagle 106.7 FM, the late Keith Kalland (1951‚Äì2002), Art \\"Madman\\" Merrhing with traffic reports, and Pete \\"Snake\\" Davis at 5:15 with a daily sport segment (which Peterson referred to as the \\"Holy Crap It's Sports\\" segment). One popular feature of Peterson's program was known as \\"Flush The Lines.\\" He would tell listeners to call en masse and would put everyone who called on the air for just a few seconds to make a (usually comedic) remark. As of about noon November 21, 2006, Kimmer's page on the WGST.com website was taken down, and at 3 p.m. it was announced that The Dave Ramsey Show (originating from flagship 99.7 FM WWTN Nashville) would air live from 3 to 6 p.m. in the Atlanta market. Peterson, along with the remaining vestiges of local talent on WGST, Denny Schaffer and Tom Hughes, were fired on November 21 as part of the nationwide restructuring of ClearChannel's radio properties. On March 13, 2007, it was posted on an Atlanta radio blog that Peterson had refused an unnamed offer and would retire from radio. The blog's writer, Rodney Ho, confirmed this with Peterson. It was later revealed that the station was Dickey Broadcasting's WCNN/680 The Fan. According to the Atlanta Radio Blog by Rodney Ho, Kim Peterson left Atlanta for good in late June 2007. He bought a property with his older brother Gene, in western Massachusetts in the Berkshire mountains, where he can play golf and ride his Harley. He also purchased property in Palm Beach, Florida, to play golf in the winter. In April 2010 Peterson partnered with Josh Price of the website Conservative Beacon to do a series of podcasts. It was anticipated that in addition to remembering his WGST radio show, Peterson would offer his opinion on current events. The podcasts ended in June of that year. Kim Peterson was heard sporadically as a guest on Denny Schaffer's show on WGKA in Atlanta. He made an appearance on Rusty Humphries new local show on WGST on January 3, 2011. On October 22, 2013, it was reported that Kim Peterson was returning to Atlanta radio and will appear from noon to 3 p.m. weekdays on WYAY All News 106.7 FM starting Nov. 4, 2013. Joining him will be Jim \\"Newsmaker Line\\" Gossett and Pete \\"Snake\\" Davis. Wayne \\"No Offense\\" Kitchens was unable to return due to other obligations.

Kurbsky belonged to a family of Rurikid princes, which got its name from the town of Kurba near Yaroslavl. At an early age, he gained renown for the courage displayed in the annual campaigns against Kazan. During the decisive siege of Kazan he commanded the right flank of the Russian army and was wounded. Two years later, he defeated the Udmurt rebels and became a boyar. At that time, Kurbsky became one of the closest associates and advisors to the Tsar. During the Livonian War, Kurbsky led the Russian troops against the fortress of Dorpat (today Tartu, Estonia), and was victorious. After Ivan failed to renew his commission, Kurbsky defected to Lithuania on April 30, 1564, citing impending repressions as his reason. Later the same year he led a Polish-Lithuanian army against Russia and devastated the region of Velikie Luki. As a reward, Sigismund II August, king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, gave him the town of Kovel in Volhynia (Ukraine), where he lived peacefully, defending his Orthodox subjects from Polish encroachments. Kurbsky thus became the first Russian political emigre.Andrzej Nowak, The Russo-Polish Historical Confrontation, Sarmatian Review, January 1997 Issue Kurbsky is best remembered for a series of vitriolic letters he exchanged with the Tsar between 1564 and 1579. In 1573, he wrote a political pamphlet, which voiced the former independent princeling's disapproval of Ivan's slide towards absolutism. In his writings, Kurbsky blames the tsar for a number of pathologically cruel crimes, but historians still disagree as to whether his claims should be given credit. Kurbsky's language is remarkable for abundance of foreign loans, especially from Latin, which he had mastered in emigration. Prince Kurbsky often supported the opposition to the regime. Grandson of Semyon Ivanovich Kurbsky was married to the daughter of a disgraced Prince Andrew of the Uglich. Kurbsky support in the struggle for the throne, not Vasily III, and grandson, Dmitri, even more than earned the dislike of Moscow's rulers. Dmitri's son Prince Kurbsky (Krupski) from Orthodoxy converted to Catholicism. And he left progeny in Belarus.:be:–ê–Ω–¥—Ä—ç–π –ö—É—Ä–±—Å–∫—ñ A dramatized account of his life, in which he is depicted as the second most powerful aristocrat in Russia, only after the Tsar, who is constantly put under pressure by boyars that want to make him revolt against the imperial authority at Moscow, can be found in the epic work of Soviet film director Sergei Eisenstein, Ivan the Terrible.

The advertising campaigns are usually aimed at women wishing to improve their appearance, commonly to increase physical attractiveness and reduce the signs of ageing.  Persuasion  The obsession with youth and beauty sends thousands of people to stores searching for a quick fix. Looking into cosmetics retailers, teenagers are trying on makeup to make them look more mature while middle-aged women are sourcing for the best anti-aging cream for her skin. The beauty industry relies on all kinds of persuasion techniques to sell products. Brands like to rely on celebrities to sell their beauty products. ‚ÄúIf the product is good enough for her, it‚Äôs good enough for me.‚Äù This philosophy is often the impetus behind advertisements for makeup, skin products, and hair products. This causes consumers spend extra money on items that might not be suitable or workable on themselves. Celebrities can also help to build brand awareness through promoting products as consumers believe the product is used by the celebrity and this can affect consumer's decision making. Beauty product advertising bombard consumers on a daily basis. They create promises to consumers that certain product can make consumers look younger or that foundation can take years off your appearance. Beauty advertising often seek to consumers of the product value or even its necessity for the consumer's well-being and self-image. The effectiveness of advertising depends on convincing consumer that the product can improve their appearance. They may use different methods to persuade individuals to make purchases. Association can be a powerful tool. It targets emotional responses when the product is associated with feelings. As many people aware that their personal appearance can have a significant effect on how they are treated by others, advertising can use these concerns by encouraging the target market. When beauty advertisements make promises that certain product can make consumers look younger. Beauty advertising often has little to do with the product. The product is often dwarfed by a beautiful woman's image. As beauty advertisement is selling the beauty and also the self-worth. This is also another important reason why celebrities are increasingly appeared on beauty products advertisements. Celebrities represent the best selves, they are beautiful and adored by millions. After consumer review those beauty product campaigns, they will start to get concerned about their appearance and start to shop for similar products because they want to be attractive, like the celebrities. People not only expect to look good, but feel good too. Consumers expect the products will make them look better than they did without the products or even believe these products will make them more appealing like some of the models who advertise the products. Therefore, Advertisers use those buzzwords to appeal to a wider range of consumers and to wider their marketing strategy by targeting new generations and gain the attention of diverse consumers. Criticism Many campaigns have come under fire through their alleged use of pseudoscience and their promotion of unrealistic goals. Moreover, many campaigns are accused of inducing harmful habits on people (such as bulimia and anorexia), and leading to destructive plastic surgery practices. In addition, cosmetic advertising is often accused of excessively using photo manipulation to enhance the appearance of models, instead of using the cosmetics themselves, creating an unrealistic image of the product's benefits, Est√©e Lauder for example. Cosmetics are a major expenditure for many women, with the cosmetics industry grossing around 7 billion dollars a year, according to a 2008 YWCA report. Cosmetic retailers design advertising to alter women's attitudes toward cosmetics, encouraging them to buy more products. Many advertisers shape this attitude by encouraging women to feel dissatisfied with their appearance. According to sociologist, Jean Kilbourne, adolescents are particularly vulnerable because they are new and inexperienced consumers and are the prime targets of many advertisements . Study after study has proven that repeated exposure to ideal beauty as portrayed by the media causes detrimental psychological effects in children and adolescents ranging from distorted body images and lowered self-esteem to eating disorders and steroid use. This thin ideal represents less than 5% of the American population leaving 95% of females with a beauty norm that is impossible to meet. Not only is it impossible to meet, but the model in the advertisement has often been photo manipulated. The flawlessness of advertising woman is, in fact, an illusion created by makeup artists, photographers, and photo re- touchers. Each image is painstakingly worked over: teeth and eyeballs are bleached white; blemishes, wrinkles, and stray hairs are airbrushed away. Media images convey normative information as to what an attractive body looks like that prompts women to evaluate their own body against this normative standard.

It maintained the traditional ukiyo-e collaborative system (hanmoto system) where the artist, carver, printer, and publisher engaged in division of labor, as opposed to the s≈çsaku-hanga (creative prints) movement which advocated the principles of \\"self-drawn\\" (jiga), \\"self-carved\\" (jikoku) and \\"self-printed\\" (jizuri), according to which the artist, with the desire of expressing the self, is the sole creator of art. The movement flourished from around 1915 to 1942, though it resumed briefly from 1946 through the 1950s. Inspired by European Impressionism, the artists incorporated Western elements such as the effects of light and the expression of individual moods, but focused on strictly traditional themes of landscapes (fukeiga), famous places (meish≈ç), beautiful women (bijinga), kabuki actors (yakusha-e), and birds-and-flowers (kach≈ç-e).

He was sometimes known by the nickname 'Coco'.John \\"Coco\\" White White was a leading figure in the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and, following a prison sentence for murder, entered politics as a central figure in the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP). Always a close ally of Johnny Adair, White was run out of Northern Ireland when Adair fell from grace and is no longer involved in loyalist activism. Early years Born in Belfast, White was one of eight children, two of whom had died in infancy, whose father was permanently disabled as a result of wartime injuries. The family had initially lived on the mainly nationalist Ballymurphy area of the Springfield Road, Belfast but had left upon the outbreak of the Troubles to move to the Old Lodge Road area of the lower Shankill.Wood, p. 6 White has claimed that although his house \\"wasn't a loyalist one\\" his father \\"hated Catholics\\" and was bitter about what he saw as the treachery of the Republic of Ireland in not becoming involved in the Second World War. Early UDA activity White began his career in loyalism with a group called the Woodvale Defence Association, a vigilante group based on the Woodvale estate in the upper Shankill, in the early 1970s.McDonald & Cusack, p. 28 Before long the WDA was absorbed into the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and White became one of this group's leading members. White was close to Charles Harding Smith, who emerged as the first leader of the West Belfast UDA, and in April 1972 he accompanied Harding Smith to London, where the two held a meeting with an arms dealer in order to procure weapons for the UDA. However, both men were arrested after the meeting and charged with the procurement of arms.Wood, pp. 8-9 After a series of mistakes by the prosecution, the case collapsed in December of that year, allowing White and the other defendants to return to Belfast.McDonald & Cusack, p. 33 Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Paddy Wilson killing White was credited with inventing the \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\" (UFF) covername adopted in 1973 in order to help the UDA to avoid being outlawed.A View North Loyalist art critics paint Belfast red, Irish Echo He claimed that the UDA had become too bloated, having as it did around 30,000 members, to act efficiently and that it was felt there was a need to separate off a hardcore of militants who were \\"willing to take the war to the IRA\\".Taylor, p. 115 When Peter Taylor replied that the majority of UFF victims were in fact Catholic civilians, White responded that the UFF felt that by killing non-combatants the Catholic community might force the IRA to surrender.Taylor, p. 116 He was the UFF's \\"Captain Black\\", a pseudonym often used for press statements, and that organisation admitted, without naming him, that he had been involved in murders.Martin Dillon, Political Murder in Northern Ireland p. 290 Amongst these was the brutal killing of the Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party Senator Paddy Wilson, who was stabbed to death and had his throat cut in 1973 along with Irene Andrews, Wilson's Protestant friend. Their bodies were found dumped in a quarry on the Hightown Road near Cavehill, with Wilson having suffered 32 stab wounds and Andrews 19.McDonald & Cusack, p. 60 White would later claim that on the night of the killing he and Davy Payne had led an assassination squad with the intention of killing a Catholic and that Wilson and Andrews had just been discovered by accident rather than being actual targets.McDonald & Cusack, p. 61 Following the killings of Wilson and Andrews, White was interned for a while before being released again. He was arrested for the murders in 1978 and under interrogation confessed his guilt and expressed remorse. White was handed a life sentence for the double murder soon afterwards.McDonald & Cusack, p. 62 Following his imprisonment, White at first remained an important paramilitary figure and served as officer commanding of the UDA inside the Maze.Wood, p. 215 He also studied with the Open University and gained a degree in Social sciences and criminology. Ulster Democratic Party Upon his release in 1992, White joined the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) and became a familiar face as the party worked with the Progressive Unionist Party to help broker a loyalist ceasefire. When the statement of ceasefire from the Combined Loyalist Military Command was read by Gusty Spence at Fernhill House in October 1994, White was one of the UDP delegates sitting alongside Spence.Wood, p. 192 Initially a strong supporter of the Belfast Agreement, White was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum talks body in 1996, although he (along with the UDP as a whole) failed to gain a seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998. According to Sammy Duddy, White's failure to get elected was inevitable as the savage nature of his earlier double murder had even sickened many loyalists and as a result, there was a reluctance to vote for him.Wood, p. 229 However, White was a high-profile figure in the developing tendency of loyalist politics and on 22 July 1996 he was even part of a four-man delegation, along with Gary McMichael, David Ervine and Hugh Smyth, to meet Prime Minister John Major at 10 Downing Street.Taylor, p. 241 Given his background in paramilitarism, White became the closest UDP member to Johnny Adair and began to work closely with the West Belfast Brigadier, much to the concern of many of his fellow UDP politicians, who saw Adair as a destabilising influence, especially in relations with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).Loyalist dismisses UDA statement, BBC News At this point, White remained committed to the Northern Ireland peace process and when word came out from the Maze that the incarcerated Adair was wavering in his support of peace, White accompanied Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam into the jail on 9 January 1998 to meet with Adair and other leading UDA prisoners to discuss their grievances.Wood, pp. 215-216 White and Adair had been near-neighbours during Adair's childhood, with both of their families living on the Old Lodge Road, although with thirteen years between them they only vaguely knew each other.Lister & Jordan, p. 25 White, who had long been a public exponent of decommissioning, accompanied Adair to meet General John de Chastelain of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning on 10 December 1999, with leading UDA members John Gregg, Jackie McDonald and Winkie Dodds also in attendance. Although the meeting ended inconclusively, White had convinced Adair that decommissioning could make his name and soon afterwards Adair called a meeting of the Inner Council at which he said the UDA should decommission every weapon it had. All the brigadiers rejected the move, although Adair leaned on Jimbo Simpson and another unidentified brigadier so that when a vote was taken, it was tied at three votes for and three against. After the others had left, Adair invited them to a second meeting at which he did not turn up but instead sent White to read a prepared statement. In this, Adair attacked his fellow brigadiers for their lack of forward vision, particularly attacking North Antrim and Londonderry chief Billy McFarland, whom he denounced as a dinosaur.Lister & Jordan, pp. 279-281 Jackie McDonald dismissed the whole plan as a scam by Adair, whom he believed wanted to make himself look good to the world's media in return for giving up a load of old and spent weapons. Around this time, Adair had already opened a new line of contact with arms dealers in Amsterdam from whom he was procuring more sophisticated weapons for his main power base of C Company.Lister & Jordan, pp. 281-283 Adair's ally As Adair moved closer towards the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) and a dissident position, so too did White increasingly become associated with the renegade end of loyalism. In 1999, he strongly condemned the killing of Frankie Curry, an active dissident who had come up with the Red Hand Defenders covername, claiming \\"it's disgraceful that a man who dedicated his life to the loyalist cause should be cut down like this by people who call themselves loyalists\\".Loyalist feud looms after killing, bbc.co.uk; accessed 19 September 2015. When Adair, who had also praised Curry, was released under the terms of the Belfast Agreement on 14 September 1999, White met him outside the prison gates and accompanied him back to the Shankill.Wood, pp. 239-240 White meanwhile came under heavy police surveillance. As a result of what he claimed to be his success as a property dealer he had become considerably wealthy and rumours began to circulate that his wealth was actually derived from his involvement in the drugs trade. White's nickname \\"Coco\\" emerged at this time due to his alleged involvement with cocaine. Progressive Unionist Party leader David Ervine would claim that he once heard White describe himself as a \\"patriotic drug dealer\\" whilst Jackie McDonald claims that White and Adair once left a UDA Inner Council meeting, only to return a few minutes later with white dust around their nostrils.Wood, p. 240 Adair's one-time girlfriend, Jackie \\"Legs\\" Robinson, also claimed that on one occasion she had been accompanied by White to Kelly's nightclub in Portrush and that as they travelled White took out a large bag of ecstasy tablets and gave her two.Lister & Jordan, p. 268 White was never prosecuted for any drug-related crimes. On 19 August 2000, White read a brief statement at a \\"Loyalist Day of Culture\\" on the lower Shankill before Adair and other UDA members, wearing balaclavas, took the stage and fired machine guns.Wood, p. 249 Later that same day a bitter loyalist feud broke out between Adair's men and the local UVF, who hated Adair's LVF allies. White's office in the mid-Shankill was blown up by the UVF as soon as the feud started and in order to underline his support for Adair, White established his new office on Boundary Way, facing Adair's house.Wood, p. 253 The feud fizzled out when Adair was imprisoned soon afterwards but White remained close and the following year was a regular at the Holy Cross dispute alongside Adair's brother James.Wood, p. 272 White was again on hand when Adair was released on 15 May 2002 and made a speech in which he claimed that Adair would make \\" a positive contribution to the peace process\\".Wood, p. 279 On Adair's behalf, White even held a meeting with Sinn F√©in's Alex Maskey to discuss peace strategies.Wood, p. 281 The meeting was not sanctioned by the rest of the UDA and soon Adair was linking up with the LVF to target fellow brigadiers such as Jim Gray and John Gregg.Wood, p. 285 In October 2002, both Adair and White were expelled from the UDA after a stormy meeting of the Inner Council.McDonald & Cusack, p. 374 After Adair supporters killed Gregg in early 2003, Jackie McDonald launched an attack on Adair's Lower Shankill stronghold and ran his supporters, including White, out of the area.

The psalter, or book of Psalms, contains 252 beautifully illustrated pages and is named after its most recent owner, the Earl of Macclesfield. History Having rested unrecognised on the shelves of Shirburn Castle for several centuries, finally revealed when the library was catalogued for sale, the Macclesfield Psalter was put up for auction at Sotheby's in 2004. Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam Museum attempted to purchase the Psalter, but the initial bid was won by the Getty Museum of Malibu, California, for ¬£1.7 million. The Psalter subsequently became a cause c√©l√®bre as, under British law, the American museum had to gain permission to export the Psalter. The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art gave the Psalter a starred rating and a temporary export bar was placed on the Psalter until 10 February 2005. In response, the Fitzwilliam Museum, assisted by an ¬£860,000 contribution from the UK Government's National Heritage Memorial Fund raised the ¬£1.7 million necessary to keep the Psalter in the country.\\"Macclesfield Psalter saved for the nation\\" Cambridge University News Article - Accessed 6 July 2008. The Psalter, now owned by the Fitzwilliam Museum, was restored, rebound and put on display from 2008.Fitzwilliam Museum's Macclesfield Psalter News - Accessed 6 July 2008. Contents The Macclesfield Psalter belongs in the \\"central tradition of the so-called East Anglian manuscripts, as exemplified by the Gorleston Psalter.\\" Like other luxury psalters, the Macclesfield Psalter was probably intended for private reading instead of public use in church. The scribe is believed to be the same one who executed two other psalters from the East Anglian group, the Stowe Breviary and the Douai Psalter. This ornament shows Doeg the Edomite beheading the priests of Nob The chief splendour of the Psalter, however, is indisputably the illumination, which is unusually lavish. There are some full- page miniatures at the start, and throughout the book each new verse begins with a small gilded initial against an ornate background of rose and pink. The initials at the traditional major divisions of the Psalms take up most of the page, and as is usual, the B of \\"Beatus vir ...\\", the start of Psalm 1, has the largest of all, a magnificent Jesse Tree. The main initials show religious scenes, either from the life of King David or events from the life of Christ that the Psalms were believed to pre-figure. The smaller initials contain various images, including kings, queens, peasants, and bishops. The margins of many pages are heavily decorated with abstract designs that constantly sprout into plant shapes, and contain many small \\"marginal grotesques\\" of no obvious religious relevance. skate terrorises a man; one of many bizarre marginalia features throughout the Psalter. The Psalter, (noted for its gaudy, vivid images and its coarse Pythonesque humour) abounds in images of grotesques and drolleries. These images include grotesques with faces on their bottoms, three-headed monsters with hairy noses, a dog in a bishop's costume, an ape doctor giving a false diagnosis to a bear patient, rabbits jousting and riding hounds and a giant skate terrorising a man. Christopher de Hamel of Sotheby's attributes the illumination to one of the artists of the Douai Psalter. Stella Panayotova believes that the versatility displayed in the Macclesfield Psalter's design suggests the involvement of multiple artists and that \\"at least two assistants decorated the borders and may have painted designs sketched by the Master\\". The original patron of the Psalter is unknown, as it appears that a coat of arms has been cut from the pages in various places throughout the Psalter. It is thought that the original owner could possibly have been John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, the possible patron of the Gorleston Psalter. The Psalter also contains an image of a Dominican friar, who may have been the owner's confessor and may also have been involved in the production of the psalter.

The film centers on the title character as he attempts to become a god through magic rituals. Plot Simon Sinestrari (Andrew Prine), a cynical ceremonial magician, is on a quest to become a god. Simon is living in a storm sewer, selling his charms and potions for money, when he is befriended by a young male prostitute named Turk (George Paulsin). Turk introduces Simon to his world of drugs, wild parties, and bizarre Satanic rituals featuring Ultra Violet and a goat. Death, freakouts and mayhem ensue, along with romance for Simon with the district attorney's daughter (Brenda Scott). Cast *Andrew Prine as Simon Sinestrari *George Paulsin as Turk *Brenda Scott as Linda *Gerald York as Hercules *Norman Burton as Rackum *William Martel as Commissioner Davies *Ray Galvin as Chief Boyle *Art Hern as Mayor *Ultra Violet as Sarah *Harry Rose as Landlord Production The misleading advertising campaign, which set up Simon as a demonic sex orgy film cashing in on the Charles Manson trials, seriously hurt the film at the box office. The film is practically bloodless, with only brief nudity (which, again against the norm, actually serves a purpose in the story) but no explicit sex and no parallels whatsoever with Manson. Like many other more eccentric 1970s low budget genre films, Simon has become a cult film over the years, albeit an extremely marginal one. There was also a paperback novelization of Simon by Baldwin Hills, more than likely a pen name, which took the satirical camp of the film one step further into full-on absurd comedy. Long since out of print, the book comes up occasionally on eBay and online used book stores. Home media Simon, King of the Witches was released on special edition DVD by Dark Sky Films in 2008. It was reissued on Blu-Ray DVD in 2017 by Code Red DVD. Reception Charles Tatum from eFilmCritic.com awarded the film one out of five stars, writing, ‚ÄúThis film tries to be serious, almost like an expos√©, but it fails miserably. It is often funny, without meaning to be. Simon, King of the Witches is all smoke and mirrors. I do not recommend it.‚Äù TV Guide gave the film 1/5 stars, criticizing the film's confusing plot. Ian Jane from DVD Talk wrote, ‚ÄúSimon King of the Witches is a wild mix of seventies psychedelics and occult quirk that makes for a truly quirky watch. Andrew Prine is great in the lead and the film might work better as a cultural artifact than an actual horror picture but regardless, it remains an interesting and well-made movie‚Äù Jason Coffman from Film Monthly.com gave the film a positive review, writing, ‚ÄúSimon, King of the Witches is an entertaining film and an interesting time capsule of very early 1970s culture... It might not be a lost genre-defining masterpiece, but it is a gem that deserves to be seen.‚Äù Debi Moore from Dread Central rated the film a score of 3.5 out of 5, commending Prine's performance, psychedelic tone, innovative effects.

Born in Cheltenham, he was educated at Cheltenham College. Initially working as an articled clerk in an accountancy firm, in 1963, he became a reporter at the Hounslow, Brentford and Chiswick Post. In 1966, Whitaker scored his first scoop when he went undercover working as a cloakroom attendant in the newly opened Playboy Club in London. In 1967, he moved to the Daily Mail, and in 1971, joined the William Hickey column team at the Daily Express. In 1975, he joined The Sun, where he struck up a lifelong friendship with Royal photographer Arthur Edwards. As a result, in 1979, he joined the team on the launch of the Daily Star as its Royal reporter. He then moved to the Daily Mirror. In November 1982, the Daily Mirror assistant editor, Anne Robinson, attended a formal dinner attended by Queen Elizabeth II, at which she noted that Diana, Princess of Wales arrived late. Robinson asked Whitaker to investigate and, after conversations with various sources, including Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, confirmed that Diana was suffering from an eating disorder, then identified as anorexia, in a scoop article on 19 November. As a result, the Buckingham Palace Press Secretary, Michael Shea, rang then Mirror's editor Mike Molloy to demand the removal of those involved in the story.

He was involved in the heavy metal bands Viper, Angra, Shaman and Symfonia and sold millions of copies worldwide. Since October 2006, Matos had been dedicating his time to his solo career. In 2012, he was ranked No. 77 at the list of 100 Greatest Voices of Brazilian Music by Rolling Stone Brasil. BiographyViper, Angra and Shaman= Matos grew up in his hometown of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. He began his musical education at the age of 10, when he received his first piano from his parents. As a teen, he would gather with his friends to listen to their favorite bands. Soon they began learning to play music too, and Matos joined his first band, Viper. The band first performed on 8 April 1985, when he was just 13 years old. That same year, they recorded their first demo tape, The Killera Sword. Matos continued on vocals, but he had no intention of remaining a vocalist, a role he assumed only because his singing was the \\"least poor vocals of all of them\\", and because he physically resembled Iron Maiden's vocalist, Bruce Dickinson. His instruments of choice were always the piano and keyboard. Matos left Viper when the band began to change its musical style. He had become interested in classical music, and felt that his musical vision had begun to diverge from that of the other band members, who wanted to focus on heavier, \\"crude\\" music. After leaving Viper, Matos went back to school and finished his education in music, specializing in orchestral conducting and music composition. In 1991, Angra was formed, and with the first album, Angels Cry, released in 1993, the band became famous in Japan and Europe. Later, Holy Land and Fireworks were released. Angra's style evolved from a Helloween-inspired melodic speed metal to a unique blend of heavy-metal, classical music and traditional Brazilian influences which brought them worldwide critical praise. In 2000, Matos left Angra alongside Luis Mariutti (bass) and Ricardo Confessori (drums) because of a disagreement with guitar players Rafael Bittencourt and Kiko Loureiro concerning the band's management. Matos stayed with Mariutti and Confessori and recruited Mariutti's brother Hugo on guitar; together they formed the band Shaman. The band was a sudden success due to the song \\"Fairy Tale\\" which was featured in the Brazilian soap opera Beijo do Vampiro (Vampire Kiss). Their first album, Ritual, sold over 200.000 copies worldwide in the first year of its release and resulted in a tour with 150 concerts around the world and a DVD called Ritualive. Their second release, Reason, kept the fame and culminated in a concert in front of 10,000 people in Rio de Janeiro. After this, the band owner and former Angra drummer Confessori fired Matos and Mariutti brothers from the band. On 29 June 2018, Shaman announced a reunion of their original lineup to tour in celebration of their 17th anniversary. =Solo records Time to Be Free and Mentalize= Prior to his passing, Matos was carrying his solo career on along with Mariutti brothers, but he often said that calling it a solo career was a big mistake; it was a band with his name, and they all decided so due to the fame of his name around the world and the frequent departure from other bands. Their first album, Time to Be Free (2007), a themed album with lyrics focused on Matos' departure from Shaman, is considered the most symphonic record written by Matos. The album charted well both in Brazil and Europe and was a success in the eyes of both critics and fans. Time to Be Free is a more personal album, even though guitarist Hugo Mariutti wrote almost every song along with Matos and Pit Passarel, an ex-band partner of Matos in Viper, who was also a guest in this album. Besides all success heading the release of the album and the expectation over the album, Matos decided not to record any worldwide video clips; he only recorded and released an exclusive video clip for the Japanese audience which features a cover. Time to Be Free was followed by a tour with more than 50 concerts all over the world; Matos was invited to tour with Scorpion and Edguy (an old friend, and this friendship began when Matos was in Angra and Edguy was invited to be the front act for Angra's Fireworks tour), taking place in Europe, Brazil and Japan, and in festivals like Loud Park, Live and Louder, and Finnish Metal Expo. Matos was also called to be headliner in ProgPower USA, but due to problems with their passport, they canceled the concert; he was replaced by another Brazilian band called MindFlow. At the end of the tour, Matos joined Hangar (a up-and-coming Brazilian metal band) to a metal Christmas project, before returning to the studio to record his new album. Mentalize was released in Brasil and Japan first, at the end of 2009, and a tour started in Brazil,with concerts in Rio de Janeiro, Recife, S√£o Paulo, Fortaleza, and some other cities. It was released in early 2010 in Europe, so Matos would profit to play in some summer festivals. Mentalize was produced by Corciolli, and mixed by Sascha Paeth. = Collaboration with Avantasia and Symfonia = In 2001, Matos was one of the guests on Tobias Sammet's metal opera Avantasia, playing the part of 'Elderane the Elf' in the Metal Opera albums. He was also part of their first world tour in 2008 as one of the main guests. In 2010, he was featured in the album The Wicked Symphony providing vocals for \\"Blizzard on a Broken Mirror\\". Matos is also featured on the live album/DVD The Flying Opera. His last appearance with Avantasia was in S√£o Paulo on 2 June 2019, a few days before his death. In November 2010, Matos joined Symfonia, a power metal supergroup formed in with Timo Tolkki, Uli Kusch, Jari Kainulainen, and Mikko H√§rkin. They made their debut performance at Finnish Metal Expo 2011 and released their first and only album In Paradisum. As touring and second album plans didn't work as planned, Timo Tolkki (guitarist, ex-Stratovarius) announced that he would stop his life in the music industry and that Symfonia would not continue as a band. =Reunion with Viper and Shaman= Mathos (right) in one of his last shows with Shaman, 2019 On 20 April 2012, it was announced that Matos had returned to his former band Viper to make a reunion tour to celebrate the 25-year anniversary of the band's debut album, Soldiers of Sunrise. The band played its first two albums, Soldiers of Sunrise and Theatre of Fate, live in their entirety. After that, the solo band and Viper joined each other on the secondary stage of the biggest Brazilian festival, Rock in Rio, for a special concert and opening act for Helloween and Iron Maiden.

Martial refers to her in Epigrams XI:53, describing her as \\"caeruleis [...] Britannis edita\\" (\\"sprung from the blue Britons\\", presumably in reference to the British custom of painting themselves with woad). He praises her for her beauty, education and fertility. Claudia is probably identical with the \\"Claudia Peregrina\\" (\\"Claudia the Foreigner\\") whose marriage to his friend Aulus Pudens, an Umbrian centurion to whom several of his poems are addressed, Martial describes in Epigrams IV:13. She may also be the Claudia whose height Martial compares to the Palatine colossus, a gigantic statue that once stood near the Palatine Hill (Epigrams VIII:60).Martial, Epigrams, ed. & trans. D. R. Shackleton Bailey, Harvard University Press, 1993 Disputed theoriesEarly Christianity= The second epistle to Timothy in the New Testament contains a passage which reads \\"Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.\\"2 Timothy 4:21 (American Standard Version) It has long been conjectured that the Claudia and Pudens mentioned here may be the same as Claudia Rufina and her husband. William Camden's 1586 work Britannia makes this identification, citing John Bale and Matthew Parker.William Camden, Britannia, Chapter \\"Romans in Britaine\\" ¬ß 54 Camden's contemporary, the Vatican historian Caesar Baronius, came to the same conclusion in his Annales Ecclesiastici.Caesar Baronius, Annales Ecclesiastici, Block VII, Sec 56, p 64; Blocks IV and V, pp 111-112; Blocks I & II, pp. 148,150; Block VI. p 228 {pagination based upon 1614 Edition of Annales Ecclesiastici In the 17th century James Ussher agreed, and identified the Linus mentioned as the early Bishop of Rome of that nameJames Ussher, Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates. Dublin, 1639; p. 10-12 (Pope Linus's mother's name is given as Claudia in the Apostolic Constitutions).Apostolic Constitutions 7.4 John WilliamsJohn Williams, Claudia and Pudens, 1848 made the same identification in the 19th century. However, beyond the coincidence of names ‚Äî the name Claudia was borne by every female member of the gens Claudia, a prominent aristocratic Roman family,William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology Vol 1 pp. 761-762 and Pudens was not uncommon as a Roman cognomenWilliam Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology Vol 3 p. 602 \\\\- there is no evidence of a link between the Claudia and Pudens mentioned by Martial and the Claudia and Pudens referred to in 2 Timothy. Martial wrote in the 90s, while 2 Timothy is traditionally dated to the 60s. Some scholars consider the Pastoral Epistles to be pseudepigraphical,; see also Authorship of the Pauline Epistles which would allow them to be dated to the 90s, but make their contents doubtful. The fact that the names Claudia and Pudens are separated in 2 Timothy by the name Linus also suggests they were not a married couple.George Edmundson, The Church in Rome in the First Century, Note C: the Pudens Legend, 1913 =Possible British relatives= Claudia's British ancestry has led to speculation that she may have been related to known British historical figures. Given her name, it has been suggested that she was related to Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus, a British king who ruled as a Roman client in the late 1st century. An inscription by Cogidubnus found in Chichester may mention a \\"Pudens\\", although the inscription is damaged so this is not certain, and the way the name is written makes it unlikely that person referred to was a Roman citizen.J. E. Bogaers (1979) \\"King Cogidubnus in Chichester: another reading of RIB 91\\", Britannia 10, pp. 243-254 In a publication of 1614, Fran√ßois de Monceaux popularized the suggestion that Claudia was the daughter of the British resistance leader Caratacus, an idea which has continued to be popular with British Israelite pseudohistory,George Jowett, The Drama of the Lost Disciples, 1961 but beyond the fact that Caratacus is known to have ended his life in Rome, there is no evidence to connect him to Claudia. Theophilus Evans in his Drych y Prif Oesoedd (\\"Mirror of the Early Centuries\\", 1740) claims that she went to Rome with Caradog, and that her original name was Gwladys Ruffydd. Drych y Prif Oesoedd became an extremely popular book in Welsh in the 19th century, which helped promote the popularity of the name Gwladys in Wales.Theophilus Evans, Drych y Prif Oesoedd, 1740, p.184 Furthermore, several British kings, such as Tincomarus, Dubnovellaunus, Adminius and Verica, are known to have fled Britain to Rome,Augustus, Res Gestae Divi Augusti 32; Suetonius, Caligula 44; Cassius Dio, Roman History 60.19; John Creighton, Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain, Cambridge University Press, 2000 and numerous other Britons are likely to have been sent there as diplomatic hostages, not to mention war captives who would have been sold as slaves, offering a variety of possible ancestries. Since Martial is not specific about her ancestry, any attempt to identify her relations can only be conjecture.

He was the father-in-law of the Chiricahua (Tsokanende) Chief Cochise, the Mimbre√±o Chief Victorio and the Mescalero (Sehende) Chief Kutu-hala or Kutbhalla (probably to be identified with Caballero), and is regarded by historians to be one of the most important Native American leaders of the 19th century due to his fighting achievements against the Mexicans and Americans. The name Mangas Coloradas is the reception of his Apache nickname Kan-da-zis Tlishishen (\\"Red Shirt\\" or \\"Pink Shirt\\") by the Mexicans and is Spanish for Red Sleeves. A Bedonkohe (Bi- dan-ku - 'In Front of the End People', Bi-da-a-naka-enda - 'Standing in front of the enemy') by birth he married into the Copper Mines local group of the Tchihende and became the principal chief of the whole Tchihende Apache division, including the neighboring Mimbre√±o local group of the Warm Springs Tchihende, directly led by the famous chief Cuchillo Negro (in Apache language Baishan), second chief of the whole Tchihende Apache division and his long- time companion. Mangas Coloradas' son and namesake (1884).Legends of America: Mangas Coloradas Apache war-leader and chief During the decades of the 1820s and 1830s, the Apaches' main enemy were the Mexicans, who had won their independence from Spain in 1821. By 1835, Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps. After Juan Jos√© Compa, the leader of the Coppermine Mimbre√±o Apaches, was killed for bounty money in 1837 in the massacre at Santa Rita del Cobre, Mangas became a war leader and a chief, and, joining forces with his friend and long-time companion (and possibly brother-in-law) Cuchillo Negro (Spanish: Black Knife), began a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans, killing and destroying all around the mining town and placing Santa Rita under siege, finally attacking the column of fleeing Mexicans and slaughtering a large number. Mangas Coloradas became the principal leader of the Coppermine Mimbre√±os, and led them for about 25 years, while Cuchillo Negro led the Warm Springs Mimbre√±os. In 1846, when the United States went to war with Mexico, the Apache Nation promised U.S. soldiers safe passage through Apache lands. Once the U.S. occupied New Mexico in 1846, Mangas Coloradas signed a peace treaty, respecting them as conquerors of the hated Mexican enemy. An uneasy peace between the Apache and the United States lasted until an influx of gold miners into New Mexico's Pinos Altos Mountains led to open conflict. In 1851 the settlement at Santa Rita del Cobre of the U.S. delegation (with General J.R. Bartlett) in the Mexican-American Border Commission, and the reopening of the Santa Rita del Cobre copper mines, effected the meeting with the Anglo- American newcomers. Mangas Coloradas, like Cuchillo Negro, Delgadito, Ponce, Coleto Amarillo and all the most important Tchihende and Ndendahe chiefs, had to face new problems. In June 1851 Mangas Coloradas, with Delgadito, Ponce and Coleto Amarillo, went to Santa Rita del Cobre to meet Bartlett, and the discussions continued until the Apaches no longer felt disappointed and betrayed by the newcomers. According to John C. Cremony's book, Life Among the Apaches, in 1861, near Pinos Altos mining camp, Mangas Coloradas was attacked by a group of White miners who tied him to a tree and severely flogged him. Yet historian Edwin R. Sweeney finds issue with this claim in his biography of the chief: if it was true, probably Geronimo, who spent a great deal of time with Mangas Coloradas during the 1850s and 1860s, would have mentioned that to his biographer as a reason for the war, yet he did not. The killing of Cuchillo Negro by U.S. troops at Canyon de los Muertos Carneros in May 1857 was an even more bitter business. In December 1860, 30 miners launched a surprise attack on an encampment of Bedonkohes on the west bank of the Mimbres River. Historian Edwin R. Sweeney reported, the miners \\"... killed four Indians, wounded others, and captured thirteen women and children.\\" Shortly after that, Mangas began raids against U.S. citizens and their property. Mangas Coloradas' daughter Dos-Teh-Seh married Cochise, principal chief of the Tsokanende or Chiricahua Apache. In early February 1861, US Army Lieutenant George N. Bascom, investigating the \\"Indian\\" kidnapping of a rancher's son, apparently without orders, lured an innocent Cochise, his family and several warriors into a trap at Apache Pass, southeastern Arizona. Cochise managed to escape, but his family and warriors remained in custody. Negotiations were unsuccessful and fighting erupted. This incident, known as the \\"Bascom Affair\\", ended with Cochise's brother and five other warriors being hanged by Bascom. Later that year, Mangas Coloradas and Cochise struck an alliance, agreeing to drive all Americans out of Apache territory. They were joined in their effort by middle-aged Delgadito and Nana, Victorio, Juh and Geronimo. Although the goal was never achieved, the White population in Apache territory was greatly reduced for a few years during the Civil War, after federal troops had been withdrawn to the east. Death In the summer of 1862, after recovering from a bullet wound in the chest, Mangas Coloradas met with an intermediary to call for peace. In January 1863, he decided to meet with U.S. military leaders at Fort McLane (Apache Tejo), in southwestern New Mexico. He was promised provisions in return for peace, but the American government didn't want to have peace with them.Geronimo, S.M. Barrett Geronimo: The True Story of America's Most Ferocious Warrior, 1906, republished 2011 , p. 73-74 Mangas arrived under a flag of truce to meet with Brigadier General Joseph Rodman West, an officer of the California militia and a future Reconstruction senator from Louisiana. Armed soldiers took Mangas into custody. West gave an execution order to the sentries. Orson Squire Fowler That night, Mangas was tortured, shot and killed under the pretext of a supposed escape attempt. While tied on the ground, Mangas was provoked with red hot bayonets until he moved to simulate his attempt to \\"escape\\".Waters, Frank. Brave Are My People. Santa Fe, NM: Clear Light Publishers, 1993. The following day, U.S. soldiers, fascinated by the size of the Apache (Mangas was 6 feet, 6 inches tall), cut off his head, boiled it and sent the skull to Orson Squire Fowler, a phrenologist in New York City. Phrenological analysis of the skull and two sketches of it appear in Fowler's book.Fowler, O.S. 1873. Human Science or Phrenology. p. 1196. (Available at ) Daklugie, one of informants in Eve Ball's book, said the skull went to the Smithsonian Institution. However, the Smithsonian has done a thorough search for the skull, and reports that it never received it. Mangas' descendants and sources based on their testimony may have confused the Smithsonian with Fowler's Phrenological Cabinet in New York, where the skull was on display, leading to the misattribution. Another possible fate of the skull was that it was returned to the Apaches by the Smithsonian in a 1990 transfer, but was not individually labeled.The Apaches: Destined for Change The mutilation of Mangas' body especially enraged the Apaches, since they believed he would enter the afterlife without his head. This further envenomed the conflict between the Apaches and the United States, leading Cochise to engage in nine-year campaign of reprisals in Arizona and Sonora.

Depending on the country or region, it may alternatively be known as a high school diploma, senior secondary leaving certificate, high school general certificate or school certificate (amongst other names). Institutional requirements differ for obtaining a high school diploma or its equivalent. For example, some schools require that all students study a foreign language, and others do not. The number of years that students are required to attend school before earning a high school diploma, the difficulty level of the classes, and the types of classes vary significantly from place to place. Names and equivalents In the United States, the qualification is known as a high school diploma. The same name is used for the equivalent qualification awarded in Canada. In England and Wales, the school- leaving qualifications awarded are either General Certificate of Education (GCE) A Level or Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) qualifications, depending on the student's choice; students pursue these qualifications after taking General Certificate of Secondary Education exams (GCSEs) at the ages of 14‚Äì16 (Years 10 and 11). In Scotland, one qualification is known as the Advanced Higher, which is preceded by the Scottish Higher, the basic university entrance qualification. In Ireland, the qualification is the Irish Leaving Certificate. In Italy, Switzerland, Albania, Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and several other countries in Europe, the qualification is known as the Matura. In Italy it is defined as \\"Diploma di maturit√†.\\" In Germany, the qualification is the Abitur. In France, the qualification is Le Baccalaur√©at. In Romania, the qualification is the Romanian Baccalaureate. In Israel, the equivalent qualification is known as the Bagrut, which means \\"maturity\\" in Hebrew. In Belgium (French community), the qualification is officially called CESS (Certificat d'enseignement secondaire sup√©rieur, certificate for upper- secondary learning). In South Africa, the equivalent nowadays is the National Senior Certificate however it was previously or is more commonly known as the Matriculation (Matric) Certificate. In Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, the equivalent is the West African Senior School Certificate. In Zimbabwe, the school-leaving qualification is the ZIMSEC GCE Advanced Level which is preceded by the ZIMSEC GCE Ordinary Level. The School Leaving Certificate is a certification obtained by a student on successful completion of an examination at the end of study at the schooling level in India. Affidavit for SLC can be obtained here. Past diploma styles A Japanese high school diploma from 1897. Diplomas were originally made of sheepskin, as paper was not very durable and was difficult to create. The sheepskin was made paper thin and information was handwritten. Soon, parchment was used for the diploma. Diplomas used to be quite large, but it has become common to print diplomas on standard letter or A4 size paper. Another difference is the method with which diplomas are handed out. Older diplomas were often rolled and tied with ribbon, but diplomas may also be presented in leather binders or framed with wood and glass. In some cases, blank papers are handed out in graduation ceremonies, and the official diploma is delivered at a later date. Requirements for receiving a diploma Most countries around the world award high school diplomas on the basis of completing appropriate coursework and passing one or more standardized tests. Every country has different requirements for receiving a diploma, and in some cases, individual schools set their own requirements. Requirements also change over time. There is no single, universal set of requirements for receiving a high school diploma. Every time and place has different requirements. A person who qualifies for a diploma, but has not yet received it, is called a graduand; after receiving it, the person is called a graduate. This Iranian diploma from 1923 lists the student's grades. Education systems based on the British model have independently marked national examinations for each subject instead of a High School Diploma ‚Äî General Certificate of Secondary Education in England and Wales, School Leaving Certificates in Ireland, Higher Grade Examination in Scotland, and IGCSE/AICE internationally. Caribbean Examination Council Certificates are also given to students in the Caribbean after completion of a five years of secondary education, and are accepted regionally and internationally. European schools use the Baccalaureate system. The International Baccalaureate (IB) is becoming increasingly popular worldwide. In the United States, most states require students to take and pass a standardized test before graduation. The curriculum and implementation has varied depending upon the state. Florida uses the English, Welsh and Northern Irish A-Level program (called Advanced International Certificate of Education) for advanced students while a number of schools in Virginia use the IGCSE. General education students who pass the twelfth grade in the US by completing enough classes, but do not meet all of the standard graduation requirements, will not receive a high school diploma, but will instead receive a certificate of attendance. Schools may offer the Cambridge International Examinations, the International Baccalaureate, and/or Advanced Placement program in addition to the high school diploma for advanced students. Schools may also offer dual- enrollment programs that enable students to earn university academic credit and a high school diploma simultaneously. Australia has six state-based systems and two territory-based systems, which have different curricula, standards and pathways, but all of which (except for Queensland) produce a common Australian Tertiary Admission Rank which is recognised nationally. Several Australian private schools, and a number of public schools in the state of South Australia, offer the IB as an alternative. Graduation The high school diploma is the symbol of having successfully completed the basic education required by law for youths. Because of this, the presentation of the high-school diploma has become an adulthood rite, that is steeped in ritual. The high school diploma is given to students at a ceremony called high-school graduation. Students who have passed their courses will have their names called out, walk across a stage, and be handed their diplomas. Sometimes, students receive blank pieces of paper wrapped with a ribbon or empty leather binders during the graduation ceremony; when this occurs the actual diploma is received later. Types of diplomas Some categories of high school diploma programs include: * Honors diploma, for student with strong academic achievements. This may include the Latin honors system used by some universities for undergraduate degrees. * College preparation, for students whose coursework and grades meet the minimum entrance requirements for public universities in that area. * Technical or vocational, for students who have completed a technical training program, such as an automobile repair, cosmetology, or information technology program. * Minimal, for students who complete the bare minimum requirements for graduation. This is accepted as a true high school diploma, but may not be sufficient for direct entry into certain universities in the United States. * Certificate of Attendance, for students who meet the attendance requirements for secondary school but do not complete the requirements for graduation. This is not generally considered a true high school diploma. * Certificate of Completion, for students with disabilities who have completed their individual Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals but did not meet requirements for high school diploma. This, like the certificate of attendance, is not generally considered a true high school diploma. At most American schools, these are the same diplomas with different notations or endorsements. With the exception of those receiving a certificate of completion or a certificate of attendance, the recipients are all equally considered to be high school graduates with the same basic rights, such as the ability to attend any community college or university that chooses to accept them. However, in other countries, this is not the case. In some countries, high schools have specialized in certain areas and issue diplomas relevant to their specialty, and a particular type of diploma is normally required for certain purposes, such as attending university. For example, in Germany, three types of diplomas are common: * Abitur, issued by German Gymnasium schools, which are equivalent to sixth form or college preparation schools. Students who earn an abitur are qualified to attend university. * Mittlere Reife or Realschulabschluss, issued by Realschule schools, which are equivalent to General Certificate of Secondary Education in the UK. * Hauptschulabschluss, issued by Hauptschule schools. Students with these usually start an apprenticeship, enroll in a vocational school, or transfer to another school to earn one of the higher level diplomas. Earning the Mittlere Reife or Hauptschulabschluss does not permit the graduate to attend university. Diplomas may also be available for students who complete special programs, which may be awarded instead of or in addition to the standard high school diploma of a region's schools; these include: * International Baccalaureate, for students who completed the International Baccalaureate program. * Advanced Placement International Diploma (APID), for students who complete the Advanced Placement International Diploma program. This is not recognized as a true high school diploma, but may be preferred or required for entry into colleges and universities, especially for students from the United States and Canada studying abroad. * Cambridge IGCSE, for international schools following the British system of education. This is accepted as equivalent to a US high school diploma, but is insufficient for university entry in the UK. * Cambridge AICE, for international schools following the British system of education. This is an academic qualification that is accepted for university entry in the UK. The names of diplomas vary by country and even from region to region within the same country.

It stressed the artist as the sole creator motivated by a desire for self-expression, and advocated principles of art that is \\"self- drawn\\" (Ëá™Áîª jiga), \\"self-carved\\" (Ëá™Âàª jikoku) and \\"self-printed\\" (Ëá™Âà∑ jizuri). As opposed to the shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") movement that maintained the traditional ukiyo-e collaborative system where the artist, carver, printer, and publisher engaged in division of labor, creative print artists distinguished themselves as artists creating art for art‚Äôs sake. The birth of the s≈çsaku-hanga movement was signaled by Kanae Yamamoto's (1882‚Äì1946) small print Fisherman in 1904. Departing from the ukiyo-e collaborative system, Kanae Yamamoto made the print solely on his own, all the way from drawing, carving and printing. Such principles of \\"self-drawn\\", \\"self-carved\\" and \\"self-printed\\" became the foundation of the creative print movement, which struggled for existence in prewar Japan along with other art movements, and gained its momentum and flourished in postwar Japan as the genuine heir of the ukiyo-e tradition. The 1951 S√£o Paulo Art Biennial witnessed the success of the creative print movement. Both of the Japanese winners, Yamamoto and Kiyoshi Sait≈ç (1907‚Äì1997) were printmakers, who outperformed Japanese paintings (nihonga), Western-style paintings (y≈çga), sculptures and avant- garde. Other s≈çsaku-hanga artists such as K≈çshir≈ç Onchi (1891‚Äì1955), Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895‚Äì1997), Sadao Watanabe (1913‚Äì1996) and Maki Haku (1924‚Äì2000) are also well known in the West.  Origins and early years  The creative print movement was one of the many manifestations of the rise of the individual after decades of modernization. In both artistic and literary circles, there emerged at the turn of the century expressions of the \\"self\\". In 1910, K≈çtar≈ç Takamura's (1883‚Äì1956) \\"A Green Sun\\" encourages artists' individual expression: \\"I desire absolute freedom of art. Consequently I recognize the limitless authority of individuality of the artist ... Even if two or three artists should paint a \\"green sun\\", I would never criticize them for I myself may see a green sun\\". In 1912, in \\"Bunten and the Creative Arts\\" (Bunten to Geijutsu), Natsume S≈çseki (1867‚Äì1916) states that \\"art begins with the expression of the self and ends with the expression of the self\\". These two essays marked the beginning of the intellectual discussion of the \\"self\\", which immediately found echo in the art scene. 1910 witnessed the first publication of a monthly magazine called White Birch (Shirakaba), the most important magazine shaping the thought of the Taish≈ç period. Aspiring young artists organized its first exhibition in the same year. Shirakaba also sponsored exhibitions of Western art. In its early formative years, the s≈çsaku-hanga movement, like many other art movements such as the shin-hanga movement, futurism and proletarian art movement, struggled to survive, experiment and sought a voice in an art scene dominated by mainstream arts that were well received by the Bunten. Hanga in general (including shin-hanga) did not achieve the status of Western oil paintings (y≈çga) in Japan. Hanga was considered as a craft that was inferior to paintings and sculptures. Ukiyo-e woodblock prints had always been considered as mere reproductions for mass commercial consumption, as opposed to the European view of ukiyo-e as art, during the climax of Japonisme. It was impossible for s≈çsaku-hanga artists to make a living by just doing creative prints. Many of the later renowned s≈çsaku-hanga artists, such as K≈çshir≈ç Onchi (also known as the father of the creative print movement), were book illustrators and wood carvers. It was not until 1927 that hanga was accepted by the Teiten (the former Bunten). In 1935, extracurricular classes on hanga were finally permitted.  Wartime  The wartime years from 1939 to 1945 was a metamorphosis for the creative print movement. The First Thursday Society, which was crucial to the postwar revival of Japanese prints, was formed in 1939 through the groups of people who gathered in the house of K≈çshir≈ç Onchi in Tokyo. The group met once a month to discuss subjects of woodblock prints. First initial members included Gen Yamaguchi (1896‚Äì1976) and Jun'ichir≈ç Sekino (1914‚Äì1988). American connoisseurs Ernst Hacker, William Hartnett and Oliver Statler also attended. They revived Western interest in Japanese prints in the form of creative print movement. The First Thursday Collection (Ichimoku-sh≈´), a collection of prints by members to circulate to each other, was produced in 1944. Such a group and publication provided comradeship and a venue for artistic exchange and nourishment during the difficult war years when resource was scarce and censorship severe.  Postwar creative print movement  Portrait of Hagiwara Sakutar√¥ (Onchi K√¥shir√¥, 1943) The rebirth of the Japanese print coincided with the rebirth of Japan after World War II. The 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty ended the American Occupation in Japan. During the occupation, American soldiers and their wives bought and collected Japanese prints as souvenirs. It can be said that Japanese prints became one of the components of postwar economic reconstruction. With the aim of promoting ‚Äúdemocratic art‚Äù, American patronage shifted from shin-hanga to s≈çsaku-hanga. By 1950, abstraction became the mode of the creative print movement in Japan. Japanese prints were perceived as genuine blending of East and West. Artists such as K≈çshir≈ç Onchi, who had shown passion for abstract expression since his early years, turned completely to abstract art after the war (abstract art had been banned by the military government during wartime). The 1951 S√£o Paulo Art Biennial was Japan‚Äôs first postwar submission to an international exhibition. Notable artists such as Shik≈ç Munakata (1903‚Äì1975) and Naoko Matsubara (b. 1937) worked in the folk art tradition (mingei), and held one-man shows in the United States.  Contemporary Japanese prints  Contemporary Japanese prints have a rich diversity in subject matter and style. Tetsuya Noda (b. 1940) employs photography and produces everyday qualities in his prints in the form of photographic diaries. Artists such as Maki Haku (1924‚Äì2000) and Shinoda Toko (b. 1913) synthesize calligraphy and abstract expression and produce strikingly beautiful and serene images. Sadao Watanabe worked in the mingei (folk art) tradition, synthesizing Buddhist figure portrayal and Western Christianity in his unique Biblical prints. From the 1960s onwards, the line between fine art and commercial media became blurred. Pop and conceptual artists work with professional technicians, and possibilities for innovation are endless.

It is the deadliest rail disaster in peacetime in the Soviet Union/Russia. History At 1:15, two passenger trains of the Kuybyshev Railway carrying approximately 1,300 vacationers to and from Novosibirsk and a resort in Adler on the Black Sea exploded, from the town of Asha, Chelyabinsk Oblast. Without anyone knowing, a faulty gas pipeline from the line had leaked natural gas liquids (mainly propane and butane), and weather conditions allowed the gas to accumulate across the lowlands, creating a flammable cloud along part of the Kuybyshev Railway. The explosion occurred after wheel sparks from the two passenger trains heading in opposite directions ignited this flammable cloud. Estimates of the size of the explosion have ranged from 250‚Äì300 tons TNT equivalent to up to 10 kilotons TNT equivalent. Many of the victims died later in hospital; official figures are 575 dead and over 800 injured, but an unofficial estimate of the number of deaths is approximately 780. 181 of the dead were children; many survivors received severe burns and brain injuries. On the afternoon of 4 June, Mikhail Gorbachev, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and members of the government commission to investigate the accident visited the site. The Chairman of the Commission for Investigation of the accident was Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Gennady Vedernikov. The trial over the accident continued for six years, nine officials being charged, mostly members of Nefteprovodmontazh (the trust that constructed the faulty pipeline) including the chief of the construction and installation department of Nefteprovodmontazh and foremen. The charges were brought under Article 215, part II of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR, where the maximum penalty was five years imprisonment. The accident was named after Ufa, the largest city in the Bashkir ASSR, although it occurred about east of the city. An annual commemoration is usually held at the , near the disaster site; there is a memorial at the site. Factors According to Dmitry Chernov and Didier Sornette, a number of factors contributed to the disaster. * Rush work culture, * Cancelling the addition of telemetry, * Taking authority to stop trains away from dispatchers, * Changing the type and the amount of the product sent through the pipe, * Changing the allowed pipe pressure (instead of inspecting the reasons for the fall of gas pressure), * Cutting corners, * No proper processes in place for safe working. Another factor, aside from gas leak's factor set, is reported to be neglectance of multiple reports about severe presence of gas in the air prior to the explosion.

The aim of this approach is to ensure that each interview is presented with exactly the same questions in the same order. This ensures that answers can be reliably aggregated and that comparisons can be made with confidence between sample sub groups or between different survey periods.  Structure  Structured interviews are a means of collecting data for a statistical survey. In this case, the data is collected by an interviewer rather than through a self-administered questionnaire. Interviewers read the questions exactly as they appear on the survey questionnaire. The choice of answers to the questions is often fixed (close- ended) in advance, though open-ended questions can also be included within a structured interview. A structured interview also standardises the order in which questions are asked of survey respondents, so the questions are always answered within the same context. This is important for minimising the impact of context effects, where the answers given to a survey question can depend on the nature of preceding questions. Though context effects can never be avoided, it is often desirable to hold them constant across all respondents. By doing so, structured interviews often have increased validity.

NVLA was founded in 1965 by Mary Whitehouse to succeed the earlier Clean-Up TV Campaign, which Whitehouse co-founded with her husband Ernest and the Reverend Basil and Norah Buckland early in the previous year. Mrs Whitehouse remained as the group's leader until 1994, when she was succeeded by John Beyer. NVLA changed its name to the current Mediawatch-uk in 2001. Mediawatch-UK are now preparing to launch a new campaign tackling 21st-century concerns, which includes tackling the effects of hate speech and xenophobia on children and young adults. Mediawatch-UK monitors traditional broadcast channels, as well as social and digital media, publishes reports about programme content, and responds to Government and other consultations on broadcasting and digital policy. It argues for greater parliamentary accountability in recognising and tackling the risks inherent in digital platforms. It also highlights the need for both governments and individual households to be proactive, not just reactive, in monitoring risks online. Previously the organisation was mainly concerned with taste and decency issues but it is now entering a new phase, and is due to launch a series of initiatives to help promote social cohesion and safety for all children, young adults, and families, irrespective of background and dynamic. A series of podcasts is due to be launched in 2019, along with a number of public consultations.

It is proposed that possession of extreme material would become a criminal offence punishable by up to three years in prison. Mediawatch-UK are due to launch a series of 'keep safe online' initiatives for young people. =Hate speech and xenophobia= In the wake of the EU Referendum, the Home Office acknowledged an increase in hate crime in the UK.

Kriminal is an Italian comics series featuring an eponymous fictional character, created in 1964 by Magnus and Max Bunker, the authors of Alan Ford, Maxmagnus and Satanik. DVD Review of Il Marchio di Kriminal‚ÄúDefinitions. Net:‚Äù Kriminal‚Äù Characters Kriminal is an English master thief, Anthony Logan, who dresses in black and yellow costume with a fearsome skull face for his adventures. The character was directly inspired by the contemporary (and more successful) Diabolik, with whom he shares the ability to use masks that allow him to assume any identity. In the earliest adventures, Kriminal was a near sadistic killer fighting for revenge against the criminals who had pushed his father to commit suicide. Having also lost his mother and sister, Logan spent his youth in a reformatory, from which he managed to escape, intent to pursue vengeance. Kriminal has a female companion, Lola Hudson whom he married and with whom he had a child, Max. He also has a love-hate relationship with Gloria, who was once the wife of Scotland Yard Inspector Patrick Milton, his main enemy. Gradually over time, Kriminal's most extreme villainous features were toned down, and in the later stories he assumed more positive and heroic connotations. The series was also notable as one of the first to employ continuity in Italian comic books, as any new story would begin exactly at the point the previous had ended, and the characters' lives continually evolved (in contrast to Diabolik). Logan himself married and had a child, who soon died.

It is a humorous, cutesy platform game. With the exception of some end- of-level bosses, the game contains no enemies.  Gameplay  Screenshot from the Amiga version The game takes place on a series of levels, each divided into eight worlds. Each world has a distinct graphical style and music, but the basic gameplay remains the same. Wiz and/or Liz must run through the landscape collecting wabbits against a strict time limit. To win, the player must collect floating letters that appear when a wabbit is collected to spell out a magic word shown at the top of the screen. Once an entire word is collected, the player then must rescue all remaining wabbits on the level, who now release collectable fruit, stars, and clocks to increase the time limit. The limit starts at three minutes and is only restarted when the player character dies. This time limit can however be extended by collecting a glowing orange orb which appears in the last ten seconds of a countdown and gives thirty seconds of bonus time. At the end of each stage, collected fruit can be mixed in a cauldron and depending on the fruit, the effect can be bonus points, a minigame, a weird graphical effect, a bit of silliness (such as declaring a \\"Game Over\\" and killing the player's character, only to put them back with a sheepish \\"Only joking...\\"), turning the wabbits different colours, or \\"Absolutely Nothing\\". Wiz 'n' Liz features a number of cameo appearances from other Psygnosis characters, including PuggsyDigital Spy. and Lemmings.Sega-16. The bonus game was featured in the original mid-90s run of the competitive gaming television show Games World (broadcast on Sky One in the UK) as one of the challenges. Players took turns to play the bonus game of collecting the blue wabbits and the highest scorer won that particular challenge. Plot Wiz 'n' Liz takes place on the magical planet of Pum, where a group of \\"wabbits\\" (rabbits) have been taken by a spell gone awry and it's the job of two wizards ‚Äì Wiz and Liz ‚Äì to rescue them.

It is primarily a residential suburb. It was named Burnside, an amalgamation of the Scottish word for creek, \\"burn\\" and \\"side\\" because of the original property's location on the side of Second Creek. Burnside is east of the Adelaide city centre by road.  Description  In the old days, trams used to travel to Burnside and terminate there Burnside was established and named by Peter Anderson and his family who emigrated from Scotland in 1839. Anderson started a large farm on leased land near Second Creek. The farm had a large number of animals including pigs, poultry and cattle as well as barley and wheat crops. In 1848, the lease was assigned to William Randall who arranged for the town to be laid out around Second Creek. By the 1870s the area had developed into a small village. Burnside Post Office had opened on 21 July 1863. There are a number of parks but most noticeably bordering several that are shared with other suburbs. The Burnside Swimming Centre is located in nearby Hazelwood Park. Langman Reserve is part of both Burnside and Waterfall Gully and the large Newland Park has several ovals. The Feathers Hotel, a Georgian style pub, is located within the suburb. It is home to Burnside Primary School, a State government school. A number of churches in various denominations including Baptist, Lutheran and Anglican also call the suburb home.  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 2,930 people in Burnside. 63.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 6.7% and China 6.1%. 71.6% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin at 8.0%.

Prior to the 1870s, Juh was unknown in the areas controlled by the United States. He went to many wars together with the Tchihende leader Mangas Coloradas and Tsokanende leader Cochise, and was particularly close to the Bedonkohe di-yin and leader Geronimo; they grew up together even though they were from different bands. His name reportedly meant \\"He sees ahead\\" or \\"Long neck.\\" Roberts, David. (1993) Once They Moved Like the Wind. New York: Simon & Schuster. . p.62-3. He was also known as Tan-D…®n-B…®l-No-Jui - \\"He Brings Many Things With Him\\" or Ya- Natch-Cln - \\"See Far\\". Life The home range of the Janeros Nednhi was usually in the remote wilderness of the Sierra Madre Occidental (called by the Apache \\"Blue Mountains\\") of northern Mexico, therefore they likely called themselves Dzilthdaklizh√©nd√© - \\"Blue Mountain People\\". They constituted the northern local group of the Nednhi and lived from the Animas Mountains and Florida Mountains in SW New Mexico south into the Sierra del Tigre,last Apache were fighting in the Sierra del Tigre against Mexican and U.S. forces into the 1930s. Sierra San Luis, Sierra de Carcay, Sierra de Boca Grande, west beyond the Aros River to Bavispe (derived from the Opata word Bavipa - \\"place where the river changes direction\\") in NE Sonora, and east along the Janos River and Casas Grandes River toward the Lake Guzm√°n in the northern part of the Guzm√°n Basin in NW Chihuahua. They were named Janeros after the Presidio and town Janos in northern Chihuahua, with which they were usually at peace and traded their goods (often stolen in neighboring Sonora). Most descriptions focused on him being a very large and stocky man. He stood over six feet and weighed 225 pounds. Juh was a natural leader, and had a stutter. Because of this, Geronimo often acted as a conduit for Juh's words.Roberts p.63 Some sources say he was Geronimo's cousin. He married Ishton, who was Geronimo's sister,Roberts p. 62 and had a son with her who was later known as \\"Asa\\" Daklugie.Kraft, p.5 He had also two sons called Delzhinne and Daklegon. Historians believe that Juh planned and executed an 1871 attack in which Lt. Howard Bass Cushing was killed, in the Whetstone Mountains of southern Arizona. A noted U.S. Army Indian fighter, Cushing had made disparaging comments about Cochise that offended Apache sensibilities, and he relentlessly pursued the Apaches (specifically Cochise) around southern Arizona and northern Sonora. At the same time, Cushing became a focus of Juh's attention. The ambush and fight in which he was killed may have been intended to teach him a lesson. It was widely thought at the time that Cochise was himself responsible for the planning and execution of the battle, but a description of the Apache leader does not match eyewitness accounts, including the observation that the Apache leader didn't speak much, but directed his fighters with gestures and hand signals during the battle. The Apache leader most closely matching the physical and behavioral description was Juh.Thrapp, Dan L.(1988). The Conquest of Apacheria. - Norman and London: University of Oklahoma Press. - P.77. - Dan Thrapp made this observation in his book The Conquest of Apacheria.

Preston (DD-344/AVP-20/AVD-7) was a Clemson-class destroyer in the United States Navy following World War I. She was named for United States Secretary of the Navy and United States Senator William B. Preston. Construction and commissioning William B. Preston was laid down on 18 November 1918 at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia; launched on 9 August 1919; sponsored by Mrs. William Radford Beale, the eldest daughter of William B. Preston; designated DD-344 on 17 July 1920; and commissioned on 23 August 1920, Lieutenant James B. Ryan in temporary command. On 7 September 1920, Commander William E. Eberle reported on board as commanding officer. Service history1920s= Following commissioning, William B. Preston operated with Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 19 and conducted trials and training off the east coast through the end of 1920. She then proceeded south to join the Fleet in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, for winter maneuvers. After these exercises, she transited the Panama Canal to participate in the Fleet's visit to Callao, Peru, and arrived at that port on 21 January 1921. The ship next received orders transferring her to DesDiv 45, Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 14; and she joined the Asiatic Fleet in mid-1922. With her home port at Cavite, near Manila in the Philippines, the destroyer cruised with her division on exercises and maneuvers. In the summer months, the ships would base out of Chefoo on the north coast of Shantung province, China, while moving southward to Philippine waters for the winter exercises. In between, there were visits to China coastal ports such as Amoy, Foochow, and Swatow and occasional tours on the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Hankow. Nanking Incident In 1926, civil strife broke out in China which can be loosely characterized as a struggle between north and south for control of the country. To the south, the Nationalist Kuomintang party moved north from its base at Canton to extend its controls over warlord-dominated areas. Led by Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalists had reached Nanking by March 1927. William B. Preston arrived in that port on the Yangtze River on 21 March and dropped anchor off the city, joining sister ship . Under orders to evacuate Americans, the destroyers took on 175 refugees - 102 on Noa and 73 on William B. Preston. Gunfire, coming closer to the city, alerted the American destroyermen to the danger posed by the approaching Cantonese. Northern Chinese troops meanwhile melted away from the city that they were supposed to defend, leaving many foreigners endangered in the defenseless city. An armed guard from Noa stood by on shore while signal parties from William B. Preston and Noa transmitted the information about the tense conditions in Nanking to the ships anchored in the muddy river. When the situation had worsened to a point of no return, Noa commenced firing with her 4-inch guns; William B. Preston joined in with her main battery as well and, in the 10-minute barrage, fired 22 rounds of 4-inch projectiles to scare off the invading soldiers. Sailors on both American ships also provided fire with bolt-action Springfield rifles and drum-fed Lewis guns. British cruiser and destroyer added to the din with their guns; and the Chinese, faced by this Anglo-American barrage, withdrew. Four days later, with the situation much quieter in Nanking, William B. Preston prepared to leave the area in company with refugee-laden SS Kungwo on 25 March. Snipers, firing from concealed positions ashore, sent the destroyer's anchor detail scurrying for cover; and ricocheting bullets whined into the pre-dawn darkness. Firing from a Lewis gun on the destroyer soon caused the sniper to cease fire. The ship, with civilians on board, was soon underway heading downriver. Three hours later, while proceeding between Silver Island and Hsing Shan fort, small arms fire again crackled from the shore, first directed at Fungwo and next at William B. Preston. Bluejackets on the destroyer promptly broke out their Lewis guns and Springfields to reply, but the situation suddenly worsened when a 3-inch gun at the fort opened fire on the ships. One shell splashed into the muddy river ahead of the destroyer; another fell in the ship's wake; and the third passed through the fire control platform. The destroyer's number one 4-inch gun was quickly trained around and fired three salvos in reply which, in addition to small arms and machine gun fire from the warship, caused the firing from the shore to be silenced. William B. Preston and her charges joined British gunboat Cricket and SS Wen-chow 52 miles below Chinkiang. Snipers once again harassed the Anglo-American flotilla, but machine-gun fire from Cricket soon forced the Chinese to withdraw. After turning Kungwo over to the British gunboat, William B. Preston returned to Nanking unhampered by further sniping. On 27 March, with 70 more refugees embarked, the ship cleared Nanking and headed downriver. Lt. Cmdr. G. B. Ashe, the ship's commanding officer, recalled that the Chinese had emplaced a field-piece at a key river bend and, accordingly, ordered general quarters well in advance. Cleared for action with guns trained out and the Stars and Stripes flying, William B. Preston rounded the bend, ready for a showdown. The Chinese, however, allowed the ship to pass without any firing. Receiving the Yangtze Service Medal for these actions against snipers while convoying American nationals out of the troubled areas, William B. Preston returned to routine cruising soon thereafter. She was back in the United States by 1929, homeported at San Diego, and assigned to the Battle Force. =1930s= To meet the obligations imposed by the naval treaties of the 1920s and 1930s, William B. Preston was part of a group of destroyers laid up in reserve at Philadelphia. She was decommissioned there on 15 October 1934. As America's Navy grew in the first months following the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the need for auxiliaries to support the Fleet multiplied accordingly. On 18 November 1939, William B. Preston was selected for conversion to a small seaplane tender and redesignated AVP-20. Soon thereafter, the ship entered the New York Navy Yard for conversion. William B. Preston was recommissioned on 14 June 1940, with Lt. Cmdr. Francis J. Bridget in command. On 2 August 1940, the ship was reclassified again, this time to destroyer-seaplane tender, and redesignated AVD-7. She departed the New York area three days later and arrived at Hampton Roads the following day. On 11 August, she headed for the Caribbean and arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, four days later. She then steamed to Panama, transited the canal on 24 August, and proceeded on to San Diego, where she arrived on 5 September for an eight-day pause en route to Hawaii. After mooring to a Submarine Base pier at Pearl Harbor on 19 September, the ship commenced operations with the Fleet. She engaged in such tasks as tending scout planes, towing targets during fleet exercises, and making routine offshore patrols through 30 September. She then anchored at Palmyra Island to tend PBY Catalinas through 4 October, when she returned to Pearl Harbor. As patrol plane reinforcements flew over the Pacific, bound for the Asiatic Fleet, William B. Preston served as a plane guard for three days in October and then resumed her routine duties out of Pearl Harbor. On 6 December 1940, the seaplane tender set course for the Philippines and her second tour of duty with the Asiatic Fleet. En route, she lay to at plane guard station \\"George,\\" while VP-26 passed overhead on course for the Philippine Islands. On 13 December, she was fueled from and then lay to in the lee of Wake Island before proceeding on to Guam. She arrived at Apra Harbor on 17 December but soon pressed onward and completed the last leg of her voyage to the Philippines when she anchored in Ca√±acao Bay, off the Cavite Navy Yard, on 22 December 1940. After operating in the Manila area through Christmas 1940, the tender took station at Puerto Princessa Harbor, near the island of Palawan, where she tended PBY's to mid-January 1941. Moving on to Tutu Bay, Jolo, on 15 January, she visited Igat Bay and Caldera Bay, both off Mindanao, before returning to Ca√±acao Bay on 8 February. From February to November 1941, the Asiatic Fleet continued its preparations. While some fleet units, including the majority of the destroyers, were sent south, William B. Preston was maintained in readiness in the Philippines for any eventuality. She tended PBY's and occasionally acted as target tug for fleet maneuvers in the southern islands in the Philippine archipelago. After an overhaul at the Cavite Navy Yard in November, she departed the Manila area on 1 December, bound for the southeastern coast of Mindanao. Upon her arrival in Davao Gulf, the ship dropped anchor in Malalag Bay, where she was joined by a group of PBYs of the newly formed Patrol Wing 10 which soon commenced patrols. The planes reconnoitered several small bays and inlets, looking out for strange ships or for any signs of suspicious activity. =World War II=1941 Shortly after 0300 on 8 December 1941, William B. Preston picked up the following radio message: \\"Japan has commenced hostilities. Govern yourselves accordingly.\\" Japan had launched a devastating air strike on Pearl Harbor while their invasion fleets moved southward from Indochina towards the raw- material-rich British and Dutch possessions in Malaya and the East Indies. The Philippines, too, were on the timetable for conquest. Soon after the receipt of the notification of war, all of the planes tended by the destroyer-seaplane tender were readied for operations. Two remained behind while the rest flew off on their first war patrols over the Celebes Sea. The ship, meanwhile, shifted anchorage away from the two moored Catalinas to lessen the chance of one bomb damaging both ship and planes in one fell swoop. Bluejackets on William B. Preston belted ammunition for the ship's antiaircraft defense of four .50-caliber water-cooled Browning machine guns and took down the awnings which had shielded the crew from the tropical sun. Around 0800, the ship's commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. Etheridge Grant, went forward to check the progress of the preparations to slip the anchor chain (should that become necessary). Suddenly a lookout called out, \\"Aircraft!\\" Grant sprinted to the bridge while Japanese planes swept around the narrow neck of the land shielding Malalag Bay from the broad Gulf of Davao. The attacking planes were nine \\"Claudes\\" and thirteen \\"Vals\\" from the . This was the first U.S.‚ÄìJapanese combat in the Philippines of World War II. Going for the seaplanes first, the \\"Claudes\\" made short work of the Catalinas riding at their mooring buoys. Within a few short moments, both PBY's had been shot to pieces and sank into the waters of the bay as the survivors, carrying one dead and one wounded comrade with them, swam for shore. Meanwhile, the ship lowered a boat to pick up survivors while she got underway for the open sea. Slipping her anchor chain, William B. Preston zigzagged across the bay as both \\"Claudes\\" and \\"Vals\\" attacked the fleeing tender. Evading the bombs, the ship managed to emerge from the attack unscathed and returned to the bay to pick up her boat and the survivors from the two lost planes. Later that day, upon receipt of orders dispatching her to Moro Gulf, William B. Preston got underway to establish another advance base for PBY's at Police Bay. Retiring from Davao Gulf, the destroyer-seaplane tender slipped past four Japanese destroyers whose attention was probably focused on bigger game elsewhere. One hour later, a snooping Japanese plane picked up the ship's scent and trailed her for three hours, leading those on board William B. Preston to suspect that the Japanese were sending out a second strike to finish the job begun earlier. Steering as close to the shoreline as safe navigation would permit, Lt. Cmdr. Grant prepared to beach the ship should that prove necessary, but the plane departed and left the seaplane tender alone. Arriving off the mouth of Moro Bay in the afternoon, the ship lay to until the following morning, 9 December, when she entered the bay. An explosion ahead of the ship sent the American bluejackets to their general quarters stations before it was discovered that the local fishermen were just out dynamiting for their catch. The ship found a PBY awaiting her arrival and commenced tending operations. Three more Catalinas arrived later in the afternoon, as well as two OS2U Kingfishers which had been attached to at Balabac. After being informed that Japanese troops had landed north of Gagayan and were marching overland to Police, the ship prepared to get underway and dispatched the PBY's on patrol over the Celebes Sea. Leaving word that the planes were to rendezvous with the ship at Tutu Bay, Jolo, William B. Preston got underway on 10 December. The ship arrived at Tutu Bay later that day and found the PBY's awaiting her, after having found no trace of enemy activity during their patrol sweeps. At sunset, a veritable procession of masts and funnels moved across the southern horizon; and the men on the William B. Preston could only guess to whom they belonged. The following day, the planes were again sent out on patrols while the ship upped anchor and proceeded for Tawi Tawi, receiving word en route that the PBY's were to return to Lake Lanao in Mindanao and the OS2U's were to rendezvous with the ship at Tawi Tawi. Although she had never hoisted aboard any aircraft before, William B. Preston's bluejackets rigged up a crude cradle between the two 50-foot motor-boats aft and provided padding for the Kingfisher's center float with mattresses and life jackets. One OS2U was taken aboard and berthed in this fashion while the other was towed astern. Smooth seas and a 15-knot pace facilitated the towing operation, and the two planes arrived safely at Tarakan, Borneo. Met by two Dutch destroyers, Kortenaer and Witte de With, the seaplane tender made port at Tarakanbut was soon underway again, this time for Balikpapan, Borneo, joining many ships from the Asiatic Fleet (, , , , and Heron. Two hours after arrival, the ship received orders to accompany the small fleet to Makassar and got underway on 13 December. After arriving at Makassar, William B. Preston spent three days provisioning and catching up on news of the progress of the war. The latter looked bleak, as Japanese forces swept southward, sweeping everything before them and forcing Allied naval, air, and ground units southward into the East Indies. The ship arrived at Sourabaya, Java, shortly before Christmas but, after further provisioning and fueling, departed the Dutch naval base there on the 27th. 1942 The ship arrived at Darwin, Australia, on the day after New Year's Day 1942 and soon received orders to provision to capacity and take on large stocks of spare parts, food, and replacement crews for the decimated ranks of personnel in PatWing 10. The ship then proceeded north for Ambon, in the Dutch East Indies, crowded with 100 extra men and much topside freight. Upon her arrival at Ambon, the destroyer-seaplane tender found sister ship and passed that ship enough fuel to enable her to reach Darwin. After delivering her embarked men and cargo, William B. Preston proceeded to Kendari, where she was camouflaged to blend in with the verdant hillside to which she was moored - in fact, she was so well camouflaged that her PBYs had trouble locating her when they returned to their base. For the remainder of January and into February, the ship continued her tending operations as the forces combating the Japanese rapidly dwindled. On 12 February 1942, William B. Preston dropped anchor at Darwin to commence tending PBYs from that base in northern Australia. In about a week, her fuel began running low, forcing Lt. Comdr. Grant to go ashore to arrange for a delivery of much-needed fuel and gasoline to the ship. At 0955, lookouts called down \\"large formations of planes approaching\\" and the ship went to general quarters. Within minutes, the ship was underway with the executive officer, Lt. Lester O. Wood in command. Zigzagging her way through the crowded harbor, William B. Preston made for the open sea. The first wave of planes attacked the town and its nearby fuel dumps and docks; the second wave went after the ships in the harbor, with transports and cargo ships as the primary objectives. Within minutes of each other, transports Tulagi and Meigs took hits; and ships alongside the docks were heavily hit as bombs rained indiscriminately on the port area. Four bombs exploded off William B. Preston's bow, breaking bridge windows. The .30- and .50-caliber antiaircraft fire forced some of the attackers to keep their distance, but others pressed the attack with vigor. , slower in getting underway, was enveloped in bomb splashes as Japanese accuracy marked the ship for destruction. Heavily hit, Peary burst into flames and rapidly became an inferno as bomb after bomb tore the ship apart and sank her down by the stern. The Preston's turn was next, however; and she was hit aft, just forward of the after deckhouse. The ship lost steering control forward; and, in the interim period between regaining control by hand-steering aft, Lt. Wood conned and steered the ship using her engines and, despite a jammed rudder, succeeded in making for an opening in the harbor boom. Negotiating it by \\"judicious use of engines and slight assistance from the rudder with direct hand steering,\\" William B. Preston escaped the inferno that left Darwin shattered and ruined as a base of operations for the Allies. Heading south down the western coast of Australia, the ship took stock of her damage. Eleven men were killed, two missing, and three wounded by the bomb hit aft. Note on casualties: Kriloff(2000) states 10 deaths. Kriloff (2002) states 15 Deaths. Eight deaths and two Missing in action is confirmed by.Ancestry.com. U.S. World War II Navy Muster Rolls, 1938-1949 [database on-line].

National Archives at College Park, College Park, MD. However the Ship's log for 19 February lists the following casualties Gluba, Kerns, Redfern and Simpson not being mentioned on the previous \\"Report of Changes\\". The after living compartment was a mass of wreckage; rivets were popped and seams sprung; the after deck house was riddled with holes; the after 4-inch and machine guns had been put out of action. At about 1445, a Japanese (\\"Mavis\\" patrol plane attacked the ship, but her bombs splashed harmlessly into the ship's wake, and the plane discontinued her attack. Proceeding to Derby, Western Australia, William B. Preston touched briefly on a shoal as she entered the harbor, and reduced the effective speed of the starboard engine down to eight knots. Meanwhile, the single remaining PBY attached to the ship returned from Darwin with the men who had gone ashore and had been caught away from the ship during the attack, including Lt. Cmdr. Grant, who had been blown out of a motorboat while returning to the ship. On 23 February, the damaged William B. Preston proceeded for Broome, Australia, and was soon joined by Childs and Heron, who both assisted the damaged seaplane tender in making emergency repairs. As Java fell, to the north, three of William B. Preston's planes served in the evacuation of Surabaya and Tjilatjap. Meanwhile, the ship received orders to proceed for Fremantle for repairs. Upon arrival, however, there were not sufficient facilities available to effect the needed yard work, so the ship was routed on to Sydney. There, on the east coast of Australia, William B. Preston received a much-needed overhaul and repair period. Her old 4-inch guns were replaced by 3-inch antiaircraft guns, while 20-millimeter Oerlikons were added as well to augment her close-in antiaircraft capability. Following her availability, the ship proceeded to Fremantle and reported for duty to Commander, Patrol Wing 10, in June 1942. Java had fallen, as had the Philippines and Malaya. Thus, the Australian sub-continent stood as the last Allied territory in the southwest Pacific to oppose further Japanese expansion. Operating out of Fremantle, the destroyer-seaplane tender alternated with Heron and Childs at such advance bases as Exmouth Gulf and Fremantle through the early summer of 1942. Anchored in the vicinity of Bay of Rest, Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, William B. Preston continued her operations as a seaplane tender through early July, attached to Patrol Wing 10 and servicing two PBY-5 planes. One plane conducted a daily patrol as far as Broome, while the other remained at a buoy near the ship with her crew living on board the tender. The ship's log noted that she was \\"in all respects ready to slip anchor and get underway instantly‚Äî-day or night.\\" The calm waters of the bay and the generally perfect flying weather combined to greatly facilitate flight operations. Relieved by Heron on 14 July, the ship cleared Exmouth Gulf, bound for Fremantle for general upkeep. Securing alongside at north dock, Fremantle, she commenced a yard period, taking on fuel, gasoline, and provisions over the next eight days, departing on 26 July. She steamed back to Exmouth Gulf and relieved Heron on the 29th. 1943 For the remainder of 1942 and into 1943, William B. Preston continued this general routine, exchanging tender duties with Heron and Childs and undergoing periodic general upkeep at Fremantle. In February 1943, a heavy storm hit Exmouth Gulf, sending two PBYs onto a reef. A third Catalina took off despite the typhoon and made its way through sheets of rain and thick clouds to safely arrive at Geraldton. Within two days, replacement planes had arrived; and William B. Preston recommenced tender operations. On 1 April, the seaplane tender moved to Shark's Bay, Western Australia, to serve as an advance base; she subsequently tended PBYs for a time at West Lewis Island, near Enderby Island, Western Australia. Later, following the month of January 1944, in which the ship received full overhaul and upkeep, William B. Preston operated out of Fremantle on submarine exercises serving as a target vessel for the submarines operating out of that port. She continued these activities through the spring and summer of 1944. 1944 At Darwin, on 18 August, the ship embarked the Deputy Commander, Fleet Air Wing 10, and other men from that unit for transportation to the Admiralty Islands. After departing Australia, she proceeded to New Guinea, arriving at Milne Bay on 22 August. Pushing on to the Admiralties, the ship dropped anchor at Manus on the 24th, disembarking her passengers and fueling preparatory to heading for the Ellice Islands. The ship made Funafuti on 31 August. Attached to Service Force, Pacific Fleet, and under orders from Commander, Air, Pacific Fleet (ComAir-Pac), William B. Preston headed for the United States. Stopping briefly at Palmyra Island and Pearl Harbor en route to the west coast, the seaplane tender arrived at San Francisco on 18 September. She then proceeded to San Pedro, California, and thence to Terminal Island for overhaul. From 1 October to 8 November, William B. Preston underwent voyage repairs and alterations to her armament. The ship also received a much-needed drydocking for bottom work before getting underway for post-repair trials which concluded on 16 November. Putting out to sea on 21 November, the newly refitted ship rendezvoused with as the carrier engaged in training operations and carrier qualification flights for new pilots. For the remainder of 1944, the destroyer-seaplane tender operated as plane guard and antisubmarine escort ship out of San Diego. Alternating in company with Ranger or , she kept a lookout for planes forced to \\"ditch\\" while in the hands of student pilots learning the nuances of the Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter. 1945 After spending New Year's Day 1945 at San Diego, William B. Preston continued plane guarding and screening duties, clearing her home port on 2 January to join Matanikau off the California coast. During flight operations on 3 January, a Hellcat crashed while taking off, and the destroyer-seaplane tender sped to the rescue. The ship's whaleboat, soon in the water, rescued the soaked pilot, and William B. Preston subsequently returned the aviator to his carrier via highline transfer. For the remainder of January and into February, the ship's duties continued to be much in the same vein, until she returned to the Bethlehem Steel repair yard at Alameda, California, on 14 February, for availability. She remained in dockyard hands until the 21st, after which time she rejoined Matanikau during further carrier qualification trials. After returning to port for a hull inspection at the Naval Repair Base, San Diego, William B. Preston operated with a succession of carriers engaged in flight training: , , , and Ranger. On 26 July, a wave caved in the forward port in the ship's office, flooding the radio room and putting it out of commission. Detached from further duty, she returned to San Diego where repairs could be made. Following completion of work, William B. Preston returned to further plane guard activities, alternating with Ranger and . War's end on 15 August 1945 found the venerable destroyer-seaplane tender at anchor in San Diego harbor. As newer AVPs joined the Fleet and the end of the war made further expansion unnecessary, the need for older ships like William B. Preston diminished. The ship departed the west coast and arrived at Philadelphia on 9 October 1945 for preparation for disposal. Decommissioning and disposal On 6 December 1945, William B. Preston was decommissioned; and, on 3 January 1946, her name was struck from the Navy list. On 6 November 1946, the Northern Metals Company, of Philadelphia, purchased the hulk for scrapping. Awards and honors William B. Preston received one battle star for her World War II service. References * Kriloff, Herbert. Officer of the deck : a memoir of the Pacific War and the sea.

He published his Genie de l'Homme in 1807, and in 1820 his Etudes po√©tiques, which had the misfortune to appear shortly after the Meditations of Lamartine, so that their originality was unrecognized. Ch√™nedoll√© was sympathetic with the romantics, and was a contributor to their organ, the Muse fran√ßaise. His other works include the Esprit de Rivarol (1808) in conjunction with FJM Fayolle. The works of Ch√™nedoll√© were edited in 1864 by Sainte-Beuve, who drew portraits of him in his Chateaubriand et son groupe and in an article contributed to the Revue des deux mondes (June 1849).

It was later released as a 2CD Limited Edition with bonus tracks and videos. Like the two previous albums, the lyrics on the compositions are stories that are all related somehow to the theme of the album, this time in a post-war mental hospital owned by a man called Dieter Meyer. History The first song that was written for the then- untitled third album, \\"Dieter Meyers Inst.\\", frontman Janove Ottesen wrote on the pump organ in Caf√© Mono, Oslo. Being a song about a man who willingly commits himself to a mental asylum, Ottesen decided to set the tone for the overall theme of the album. In January 2004, a 30-track demo was recorded, which the band pitched to various record labels. They eventually landed a contract with Universal Germany. On 27 February 2004, during a concert at the Rockefeller concert hall in Oslo, a new song called \\"Medisin og psykiatri\\" was played. Also, the song \\"Tokyo Ice til Clementine\\" was played once at an acoustic session for the Dutch Pinkpop Festival. Later in 2004, two more new songs, \\"Delikatessen\\" and \\"Maestro\\" were played at a German musical event called \\"Eine Nacht in Bochum\\". The event was broadcast on the German radio station 1LIVE. \\"Medisin og psykiatri\\" was eventually scrapped both from setlists and the album. The first single, \\"Maestro\\", was changed from its original version to a more hit-friendly style. Some fans claims the track was \\"popped\\" after pressure from Universal, but Ottesen has never agreed to that statement. A video for \\"Maestro\\" was also recorded in Germany. Before releasing the album, now officially named Maestro, Kaizers released an EP with the same name, featuring the single, the album track \\"P√• ditt skift\\" and two b-sides; \\"D-dagen\\" and \\"Sorti\\", as well as the \\"Maestro\\" video. The release garnered much critical praise and helped to build expectations for the new release. Maestro was finally released on August 15, 2005, and the record received outstanding reviews from most of the larger newspapers in Norway as well as Scandinavia and other European countries. Shortly thereafter, the Maestro Tour, spanning most of central Europe and later Scandinavia, commenced. At the end of the tour, on October 5 and October 6, the band performed two sold out shows two nights in a row at the famous Vega concert hall in Copenhagen, Denmark. The last performance was recorded for a future live DVD and album, Viva La Vega and Live at Vega, respectively. After some time, a 2CD Limited Edition of Maestro was released, featuring a bonus CD featuring three previously unreleased tracks. This Limited Edition reissue was originally intended to be recalled after the end of their tour, but can still be found in music retailers to this day. Maestro is by many fans considered to be their best album, although this is highly subjective, and Kaizers Orchestra have received good reviews for all of their albums. Still, Maestro, is recognized for leading to their big breakthrough outside of Norway. Track listing Lyrics for all songs are in the Norwegian language.

Hebe de Bonafini .New Internationalist, May 2003. Interview with David Ransom .Punto Final. Entre la lucha y los recuerdos. Life and times As president of the Mothers Association since 1979, Bonafini has spoken out in defense of her concept of human rights, both in Argentina and abroad, gaining international recognition; she received the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education in 1999. Adopting the rallying cry of Aparici√≥n con vida (Make them appear alive) in 1980, Bonafini demanded an immediate accounting of all of the forced disappearances, including her sons. Amid a gradual loosening of restrictions, she organized a March of Resistance along the Avenida de Mayo on December 10, 1982. This event marked the first time the group marched outside the namesake Plaza de Mayo, and the first time it was joined by large crowds of sympathizers.Bennett, Adam, Ludlow, Marcee, and Reed, Christopher. Madres de Plaza de Mayo. University of Texas Following the return to civilian rule in 1983, divisions began to develop in the organization relating to what they believed to be President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's overly cautious progress in prosecuting Dirty War perpetrators. Alfons√≠n established the 1985 Trial of the Juntas; but the decision to limit the proceedings to nine leading military junta members, as well as the acquittals handed to five of these, further antagonized Bonafini, who believed the president would forego further prosecutions for political considerations. The Mothers Association split in 1986, establishing two groups of around 2,000 members each: Bonafini's Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association, and the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo ‚Äî Founding Line. Bonafini has generally been identified with the more radical faction, choosing to justify the methods undertaken by guerrillas during the last dictatorship. On the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bonafini generated international controversy when she defended the actions of the terrorist airline hijackers saying \\"I felt that there were many people in that moment who were happy and felt that the blood of so many in that moment were avenged... because the NATO bombings, the blockades and the millions of children who die of hunger in this world, that was due to this power that those men attacked, with their own bodies. And everyone knew it.\\" Bonafini stands behind her support to organizations accused of terrorism such as FARC.\\"Hebe de Bonafini respald√≥ a guerrilleros de las FARC\\", Infobae, 2008 . , leader of the etarran Askapena organization, was invited as guest teacher in the University of Mothers of Plaza de Mayo. Journalist Horacio Verbitsky criticized her support of the terrorist attacks, and Bonafini replied that \\"Verbitsky is a servant of the United States. He receives wages from the Ford Foundation and, besides being Jewish, he is completely Americophile.\\" She was accused of antisemitism, but denied it by saying that she merely intended to describe Verbitsky as an American agent. Verbitsky requested the tapes of the interview to the magazine that published them, and confirmed that Bonafini indeed said what the magazine had reported she said. She generated more controversy in 2005 by stating that, as Pope John Paul II \\"committed many sins, he [would] go to hell.\\" She added that she \\"didn't say more than what the Roman Catholic Church taught me.\\"Clar√≠n, 13 April 2005. \\"Bonafini carg√≥ duro contra las Abuelas, Juan Pablo II y Blumberg\\". The relationship of the N√©stor and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner administrations with Bonafini has been very close. President N√©stor Kirchner received Bonafini at the Casa Rosada within days of his May 25, 2003, inaugural, and regularly consulted her during his tenure.La Naci√≥n: Kirchner recibi√≥ a Hebe de Bonafini en la Casa Rosada Clar√≠n, 26 December 2006. \\"Kirchner recibi√≥ a Hebe de Bonafini en Casa de Gobierno\\". Bonafini announced in January 2006 that her organization would discontinue its annual March of Resistance out of recognition for President N√©stor Kirchner's success in having the Full Stop Law and Law of Due Obedience (two Alfons√≠n-era measures which had effectively ended most Dirty War prosecutions) declared unconstitutional.Clar√≠n: Bonafini anunci√≥ que las Madres har√°n la √∫ltima Marcha de la Resistencia The Association of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, led by Bonafini, has benefited from increased government funding during the Kirchner administrations, and has extended its influence through a newspaper (La Voz de las Madres), a radio station, and a university (Popular University of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo). The association also manages a federally funded housing program, Sue√±os Compartidos (\\"Shared Dreams\\"), which by 2008 oversaw construction of over 2,600 housing units earmarked for slum residents.P√°gina/12: \\"Las Madres y su construcci√≥n de sue√±os\\" Sue√±os Compartidos had completed 5,600 housing units and numerous other facilities in six provinces and the City of Buenos Aires by 2011. Its growing budgets, which totaled around US$300 million allocated between 2008 and 2011 (of which $190 million had been spent), came under scrutiny and generated nationwide controversy when a suspected case of embezzlement by the chief financial officer of Sue√±os Compartidos, Sergio Schoklender, and his brother Pablo (the firm's attorney) arose. The Schoklender brothers, who were convicted in 1981 for the murder of their parents and spent fifteen years in prison, had gained Bonafini's confidence and managed the project's finances with little oversight from either the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo or the program's licensor, the Secretary of Public Works. Their friendship ended in June 2011, however, after Bonafini became aware of irregularities in their handling of the group's finances. Following an investigation ordered by Federal Judge , the Secretary of Public Works canceled the Sue√±os Compartidos contract in August and transferred the outstanding projects to the Undersecretary of Housing and Urban Development. Bonafini has expressed support for figures such as Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Augusto Sandino, Yasser Arafat, Hugo Ch√°vez, Evo Morales, and the mothers of ETA prisoners. She has declared herself against social democracy, capitalism, neo-liberalism, globalization, and the International Monetary Fund. She has also attacked Bolivian protesters for occupying Plaza de Mayo, calling them \\"shitty\\"; and suggested seizing the Supreme Court by force at the delays of the application of the Audiovisual Media Law.

The Thesprotians (Greek: ŒòŒµœÉœÄœÅœâœÑŒøŒØ, Thespr≈çto√≠) were an ancient Greek tribe, akin to the Molossians, inhabiting the kingdom of Thesprotis in Epirus.; ; ; . Together with the Molossians and the Chaonians, they formed the main tribes of the northwestern Greek group.. On their northeastern frontier, they neighbored the Chaonians and on their northern frontier they neighbored the kingdom of the Molossians. The poet Homer frequently mentions Thesprotia, which had friendly relations with Ithaca and Doulichi. The Thesprotians originally controlled the Dodona oracle, the oldest religious shrine in Greece. Later, they were part of the Epirus until they were annexed into the Roman Empire. Geography The League of Epirus, 234 BC. Strabo puts the Thesprotians' territory, Thesprotis, on the coast of southwest Epirus. Thesprotis stretched between the Ambracian Gulf in the south to the River Thyamis (modern-day Kalamas) in the north, and between the Pindus mountains and the Ionian Sea. According to legend, the nation got its name from the Pelasgian leader and first governor Thesprotos, who built Cichyrus (Cichorus), which later was called Ephyra, the capital of Thesprotia. Other important cities of Thesprotia include Pandosia,. Titani, Cheimerium, Toryne, Phanote, Cassope,. Photice, Boucheta. and Batiai. There was a city called Thesprotia sharing the same name with the tribe itself.. Tribe According to Strabo, the Thesprotians (along with the Chaonians and the Molossians) were the most famous among the fourteen tribes of Epirus, as they once ruled over the whole region. The Chaonians ruled Epirus first while the Thesprotians and Molossians ruled afterwards. Plutarch tells us that the Thesprotians, the Chaonians and the Molossians were the three principal clusters of Greek tribes that had emerged in Epirus, and all three were the most powerful among all other tribes.Plutarch. Parallel Lives, \\"Pyrrhus\\". Strabo also records that the Thesprotians, Molossians, and Macedonians referred to old men as pelioi and old women as peliai (PIE: *pel- means grey; Ancient Greek: pelitn√≥s ‚Äì \\"grey\\", peleia ‚Äì \\"dove\\", so-called because of its dusky grey color, poli√≥s ‚Äì grey, and poll√≥s ‚Äì \\"dark\\"). Their senators were called Peligones (Œ†ŒµŒªŒπŒ≥œåŒΩŒµœÇ), similar to Macedonian Peliganes (Œ†ŒµŒªŒπŒ≥·æ∂ŒΩŒµœÇ).: œÄŒµŒªŒπŒ≥·æ∂ŒΩŒµœÇ. An inscription from Goumani, dated to the second half of the 4th century BC,; PHI Greek Inscriptions. indicates that the organisation of the Thesprotian state was similar to that of the other Epirotes.. Terms for office were prostates (Greek: œÄœÅŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÑŒµœÇ) literally meaning \\"protectors\\" like most Greek tribal states at the time.; . Other terms for office were grammateus (Greek: Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒ≠œÖœÇ) meaning \\"secretary\\", demiourgoi (Greek: Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒπŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒøŒØ) literally meaning \\"creators\\", hieromnemones (Greek: ŒπŒµœÅŒøŒºŒΩŒÆŒºŒøŒΩŒµœÇ) literally meaning \\"of the sacred memory\\" and synarchontes (Greek: œÉœÖŒΩŒ¨œÅœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ) literally meaning \\"co-rulers\\".. =Subtribes= The Thesprotians were divided into many subtribes that included the Elopes, Graeci, Kassopaeoi, Dryopes, Dodonians (Greek: ŒîœâŒ¥œâŒΩŒ±ŒØŒøŒπ), Aegestaeoi, Eleaeoi, Elinoi, Ephyroi, Ikadotoi, Kartatoi, Kestrinoi, Klauthrioi, Kropioi, Larissaeoi, Onopernoi, Opatoi, Tiaeoi, Torydaeoi, Fanoteis, Farganaeoi, Parauaei, Fylates and the Chimerioi. Some of these tribes throughout antiquity migrated to and established colonies in Ithaca, Lefkada, Acarnania, parts of southern Greece, Thessaly and Italy.. Mythology According to the Telegony (Epic Cycle), Odysseus came upon the land of Thesprotia where he stayed for a number of years. He married Thesprotia's queen, Kallidike (Callidice, Kallidice), and had a son with her named Polypoetes. Odysseus led the Thesprotians in the war against the Brygoi (Brygi), but lost the battle because Ares was on the side of the Brygoi. Athena went to support Odysseus, by engaging the war god in another confrontation until Apollo separated them. When Kallidike died, Odysseus returned home to Ithaca, leaving their son, Polypoetes, to rule Thesprotia.Telegony, Fragment 1 (from Proclus, Chrestomathia 2).

The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62√ó38mmR, and featured an unusual \\"gas-seal\\" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver). Its design would inspire the M1893 Pieper Carbine and Steyr 1893 revolver.  Russian M1895  L√©on Nagant and his brother √âmile were well known in the Russian Tsar's court and military administration because of the part they had played in the design of the Russian service rifle, the Mosin‚ÄìNagant Model 1891. The Nagant M1895 was adopted as the standard issue side arm for the Imperial Russian Army and police officers, where it replaced earlier Smith & Wesson models such as the Model 3.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 248. Production began in Li√®ge, Belgium; however Russia purchased the manufacturing rights in 1898, and moved production to the Tula Arsenal in Russia, and was soon producing 20,000 examples per year. Until 1918 it was produced in two versions: a double-action version for officers, and a cheaper single-action version for the ranks.–í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π –ö—Ä—é—á–∏–Ω. –ê—Ä—Å–µ–Ω–∞–ª: –ù–ê–ì–ê–ù: –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ —Å –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º // –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª ¬´–ë—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—à–∫–∞¬ª, –º–∞–π 2008 –≥–æ–¥–∞ It continued to be used after the Russian Revolution by the Red Army and Soviet security forces. The distinctive shape and name helped it achieve cult status in Russia and in the early 1930s the presentation of a Nagant M1895 revolver with an embossed Red Star was one of the greatest honors that could be bestowed on a Party Member. The common Russian name for the revolver, –Ω–∞–≥–∞–Ω (nagan) became synonymous with the concept of the revolver in general and was applied to such weapons regardless of actual make or model. As early as 1933 the M1895 had started to be replaced by the Tokarev semi-automatic pistol but was never fully replaced until the Makarov pistol in 1952.

Technical characteristics  Revolvers typically have a small gap (sometimes called the flash gap) between the cylinder and the barrel to allow the cylinder to revolve. The bullet must \\"jump\\" this gap when fired, which can have an adverse effect on accuracy, especially if the barrel and chamber are misaligned. The gap also is a path for the escape of high pressure (and temperature) gases. Expensive revolvers such as Korth and Manurhin are hand-fitted, keeping the gap to a minimum. Mass-produced revolvers may have a gap as large as 0.25 mm. The M1895 by contrast, has a mechanism which, as the hammer is cocked, first turns the cylinder and then moves it forward, closing the gap between the cylinder and the barrel. The cartridge, also unique, plays an important part in sealing the gun to prevent the escape of propellant gases. The bullet is deeply seated, entirely within the cartridge case, and the case is slightly reduced in diameter at its mouth. The barrel features a short conical section at its rear; this accepts the mouth of the cartridge, completing the gas seal. By sealing the gap, the velocity of the bullet is increased by 15 to 45 m/s (50 to 150 ft/s.) This feature also eliminates the possibility of injury from gases escaping through the gap, which can injure a finger if the user hold the gun with a finger positioned beside the gap. Holstered Nagant with the gate open for loading. The disadvantage of this design is that Nagant revolvers were laborious and time-consuming to reload, with the need to manually eject each of the used cartridges, and reload one cartridge at a time through a loading gate. At the time the revolver was designed, this system was obsolete. In England the Webley revolver used a break action that simultaneously ejected all six spent cartridges; and in America the swinging crane and star ejector had replaced the loading gate and ejector rod system. However, the Nagant design did have the advantage of requiring less machining than more modern designs. The Nagant M1895 was made in both single-action and double-action models before and during World War I; they are known colloquially as the ‚ÄúPrivate's model‚Äù and the ‚ÄúOfficer‚Äôs model‚Äù, respectively. Production of the single-action model seems to have stopped after 1918, with some exceptions, including examples made for target competition. Most single-action revolvers were later converted to double-action, making original single-action revolvers rather rare. Whether fired in single action or double action, the Nagant M1895 has a markedly heavy trigger pull (about ~12 lbs for single and ~20 lbs for double). Enthusiasts have been able to adjust the pull by adjusting the V shaped spring, either by grinding it or shimming it.  History and usage  The M1895 revolver was used extensively by the Russian Imperial Army and later by the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution. In Russian service, it was known for its extreme sturdiness and ability to withstand abuse. As one former Imperial Russian officer stated, \\"if anything went wrong with the M1895, you could fix it with a hammer\\". It was widely employed by the Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka, as well as its Soviet successor agencies, the OGPU and NKVD. Seven Nagant revolvers were used by communist revolutionaries to execute the Russian imperial family and their servants in July 1918.Rappaport, The Last Days of the Romanovs: Tragedy at Ekaterinburg (2009), p. 181 In the police role, it was frequently seen with a cut-down barrel to aid in concealment by plainclothes agents. Despite the advent of the more modern Soviet TT pistol, the M1895 remained in production and use throughout World War II. The Nagant's sealed firing system meant that the Nagant revolver, unlike most other revolvers, could make effective use of a sound suppressor, and suppressors were sometimes fitted to it. Suppressed M1895 Nagant revolvers, modified in clandestine workshops, also turned up in the hands of Viet Cong guerrillas during the Vietnam War as assassination weapons. There is an example of a suppressed Nagant M1895 in the CIA Museum in Langley, Virginia, USA. The weapon was considered \\"antique\\" in Belgium and it became legal to be in possession of the weapon. In 2013 the weapon was again prohibited. Nagant revolvers have been found with the terrorist Am√©dy Coulibaly in 2015 and with a Dutch arms dealer.

Cartridges  Russian = 7.62√ó38mmR (7.62 mm Nagant) cartridge, left, shown next to a .32 S&W; Long Cartridge (middle) and a .22 LR cartridge (right) for comparison. 7.62mm Nagant is also known as 7.62√ó38mmR (Rimmed) or \\"Cartridge, Type R\\". The projectile is seated below the mouth of the cartridge, with the cartridge crimp sitting just above the bullet. When fired, the crimp expands into the forcing cone, completing the gas seal and ostensibly increasing muzzle velocity by approximately 75 ft/s. The 7.62 mm caliber was chosen, in part, to simplify the tooling used in barrel-making and manufacture of projectiles because the Russian service rifle of the time, the Mosin‚ÄìNagant M91, featured an identical bore diameter, being chambered for the 7.62√ó54mmR rifle cartridge. Actual bullet diameter of both the revolver and rifle bullets is 7.91mm or .311 inch. Aftermarket cylinders for .32 can be installed, allowing the Nagant to safely fire .32 H&R; or .32 ACP. Shooting any ammunition other than the 7.62x38mmR cartridge with the original cylinder can result in bodily injury from bullet shrapnel or escaping gas, and the excessive pressures produced by some .32 ammunition could also result in catastrophic failure of the cylinder or frame. Comparison of .32 Smith & Wesson Long, .32 H&R; Magnum and 7.62√ó38mmR Nagant Proper fitting ammunition can be reloaded from .32-20 Winchester brass by using the Lee Nagant die set or .30\\" carbine dies and 9mm Luger shell-holders in the reloading press. This allows the reloaders to work up a load that fits their needs and is specific for the Nagant. While this eliminates the bulged/split/stuck cases experienced when using .32 S&W; and .32 H&R;, the gas seal that made the Nagant famous will still not fully function, due to the .32-20 not being long enough to protrude past the cylinder like the original Nagant ammunition. = Swedish / Norwegian = 7.5 mm Swedish/ Norwegian Nagant round Other Nagant revolver designs were also adopted by police and military services of Sweden (7.5mm M1887), Norway (M1893), Poland ((Nagant wz. 30), and Greece ( M1895). The Swedish and Norwegian Nagants used a different cartridge, the 7.5 mm Nagant. This ammunition is interchangeable with the 7.5mm 1882 Ordnance (aka Swiss 7.5mm revolver).

H. Lawrence, started in 1918 and published in 1922. Background Lawrence began writing Aaron's Rod early in 1918, but abandoned the work after its first eleven chapters. The longer portion that finishes Aaron's Rod was written by Lawrence in 1921. The biblical title refers to the rod of Aaron in the Old Testament, Moses' brother who built the Golden Calf in the desert for the worship of the Israelites. The rod, his divine symbol of authority and independence, finds its echo in the flute of Aaron Sisson. Synopsis Aaron Sisson, a union official in the coal mines of the English Midlands, is trapped in a stale marriage. He is also an amateur, but talented, flautist. At the start of the story he walks out on his wife and two children and decides on impulse to visit Italy. His dream is to become recognised as a professional musician. During his travels he encounters and befriends Rawdon Lilly, a Lawrence-like writer who nurses Aaron back to health when he is taken ill in post-war London. Having recovered his health, Aaron arrives in Florence. Here he moves in intellectual and artistic circles, argues about politics, leadership and submission, and has an affair with an aristocratic lady. The novel ends with an anarchist or fascist explosion that destroys Aaron‚Äôs instrument. Publication history Aaron's Rod was first published in the USA by Thomas Seltzer in April 1922, followed in June 1922 by the UK edition published by Martin Secker. In 1950, it was published in the United Kingdom by Penguin Books. In 1961, it was published in a Viking Compass Edition in the United States, and in 1976 it was published in the United States by Penguin Books. Reception The poet Richard Aldington commented that Aaron's Rod is a hastily written text, similar in this respect to Lawrence's novels The Lost Girl (1920) and Kangaroo (1923). He notes that there are inconsistencies from page to page, concerning details such as the names and backgrounds of Lawrence's characters. In his view, the novel's chapters are \\"improvised variations on Lawrence's own experience\\", and satirize people Lawrence knew. He sees the character Lilly as Lawrence himself, and Aaron as John Middleton Murry. He believes that the book's theme is Lawrence's gratification of his frustrated longing for an \\"utterly obedient and subservient disciple.\\" He criticizes the book's early chapters, writing that they have little or nothing of Lawrence's \\"personal daimon\\", and lack the \\"thrilling eloquence and passionate poetry and subtle physical emotion of which he alone had the secret\\", while the book as a whole shows \\"the satirical Lawrence, not at his best, but almost at the level of spiteful gossip.\\" References External links  * Digital facsimile at the Internet Archive * Category:1922 British novels Category:Novels by D.

In the Second Empire In 1848, during the French uprising, he proclaimed himself a Republican; but, after the establishment of the Second Empire, he changed his views, and in 1865 was returned to the Chamber of Deputies as the official candidate for his native place. He at once became conspicuous, both for his eloquence and for his uncompromising clericalism, especially in urging the necessity for maintaining the temporal power of the papacy. In 1869 he was again returned, and, devoting himself to financial questions, was in 1870 appointed to report the budget. During and after the Franco-Prussian War, for which he voted, he retired for a while into private life; but in 1872 he was again elected deputy, this time as a Legitimist, and took his seat among the conservative Right of the French Third Republic. In the Republic He was the soul of the reactionary opposition that led to the fall of Adolphe Thiers; in 1873, it was he who, with Lucien Brun, carried the proposals of the Chambers to the Bourbon claimant Comte de Chambord. Through some misunderstanding, he reported on his return that the count had accepted all the terms offered, including the retention of the drapeau tricolore - the Count published a formal denial, which brought about his own downfall. Chesnelong now devoted himself to the establishment of Roman Catholic universities and to the formation of Roman Catholic working-men's clubs (to combat the trade unionism of various socialists). In 1876 he was again returned for Orthez, but was unseated, and then beaten by the Republican candidate. On November 24, however, he was elected to a seat in the French Senate, where he continued his vigorous polemic against the progressive attempts of the republican government to secularize the educational system of France until his death in 1894.

The name came from the use of InterCity trains to travel to away games. Notable associates One figure associated with the ICF was Cass Pennant, who wrote on football hooliganism in the 1990s and 2000s. He is the subject of the film Cass, which was released on 1 August 2008. In Congratulations You Have Just Met the ICF, Pennant, a black Londoner, maintains that the ICF was not racist or right-wing. The main character in the film Rise of the Footsoldier, Carlton Leach, is also associated with the ICF. He, along with Pat Tate, Tony Tucker and Craig Rolfe, later started to get involved in the criminal underworld in London. They strayed away from the dangers of football fights, to focus on selling drugs and taxing dealers. Tate, Tucker and Rolfe met a brutal end when they were murdered in their Range Rover on a farm road in Rettendon, Essex. In the foreword to Manchester United hooligan Colin Blaney's book Undesirables: The Inside Story of the Inter City Jibbers, Cass Pennant has stated that he is now friendly with members of various other firms, including Manchester United and Manchester City, suggesting that some of the rivalries of yesteryear have now died down. Calling cards The ICF pioneered calling cards that were left on victims. They read \\"Congratulations, you've just met the ICF\\". Similar cards were used by Leeds United Service Crew. This became, \\"Congratulations you've just met the famous ICF\\", when the ICF were the subject of a Thames Television documentary, Hooligan, which featured ICF members including Cass Pennant. In popular culture The ICF were the basis of Alan Clarke's 1988 film, The Firm. Gary Oldman plays Bex Bissell, the leader of the ICC - Inter City Crew. Members of the ICF were used as consultants on the film. The 2005 film Green Street was based on the ICF, but not by name. Instead, the initials GSE (Green Street Elite) were used. The ICF make an appearance in Irvine Welsh's novellas Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance. The ICF are also suggested in the 2009 film Green Street 2: Stand Your Ground. The ICF also make a return as the GSE in Green Street 3: Never Back Down. ReferencesExternal links * * Category:West Ham United F.C.

Their activity today centers on collective bargaining over wages, benefits, and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger trade unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level. Most unions in the United States are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the AFL-CIO created in 1955, and the Change to Win Federation which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues. In 2019, there were 14.6 million members in the U.S., down from 17.7 million in 1983. The percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labor union \\"density\\") was 10.3%, compared to 20.1% in 1983. Union membership in the private sector has fallen to 6.2%, one fifth that of public sector workers, at 33.6%. Over half of all union members in the U.S. lived in just seven states (California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, and Washington), though these states accounted for only about one-third of the workforce. From a global perspective, in 2016 the US had the fifth lowest trade union density of the 36 OECD member nations.See: Trade Union Density. OECD. StatExtracts. Retrieved: 1 January 2017.See also Trade_union#Trade_Union_Prevalence_Worldwide In the 21st century the most prominent unions are among public sector employees such as city employees, government workers, teachers and police. Members of unions are disproportionately older, male, and residents of the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.Not With a Bang, But a Whimper: The Long, Slow Death Spiral of America's Labor Movement Richard Yeselson June 6, 2012 Union workers average 10-30% higher pay than non-union in the United States after controlling for individual, job, and labor market characteristics.8-31-2004 Union Membership Trends in the United States Gerald Mayer. Congressional Research Service. 8-31-2004 Although much smaller compared to their peak membership in the 1950s, American unions remain a political factor, both through mobilization of their own memberships and through coalitions with like-minded activist organizations around issues such as immigrant rights, trade policy, health care, and living wage campaigns. Of special concern are efforts by cities and states to reduce the pension obligations owed to unionized workers who retire in the future. Republicans elected with Tea Party support in 2010, most notably former Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, have launched major efforts against public sector unions due in part to state government pension obligations (even though Wisconsin's state pension is 100% funded as of 2015 ) along with the allegation that the unions are too powerful.Nelson Lichtenstein, \\"Can This Election Save the Unions?,\\" Dissent Summer 2012.Jason Stein and Patrick Marley, More than They Bargained For: Scott Walker, Unions, and the Fight for Wisconsin (2013) is favorable toward Walker, who beat off a recall challenge and was easily reelected in 2014 The academic literature shows substantial evidence that labor unions reduce economic inequality.

National labor unions began to form in the post- Civil War Era. The Knights of Labor emerged as a major force in the late 1880s, but it collapsed because of poor organization, lack of effective leadership, disagreement over goals, and strong opposition from employers and government forces. The American Federation of Labor, founded in 1886 and led by Samuel Gompers until his death in 1924, proved much more durable. It arose as a loose coalition of various local unions. It helped coordinate and support strikes and eventually became a major player in national politics, usually on the side of the Democrats. American labor unions benefited greatly from the New Deal policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1930s. The Wagner Act, in particular, legally protected the right of unions to organize. Unions from this point developed increasingly closer ties to the Democratic Party, and are considered a backbone element of the New Deal Coalition. =Post-WWII= Political cartoon showing organized labor marching towards progress, while a shortsighted employer tries to stop labor (1913) Pro-business conservatives gained control of Congress in 1946, and in 1947 passed the Taft-Hartley Act, drafted by Senator Robert A. Taft. President Truman vetoed it but the Conservative coalition overrode the veto. The veto override had considerable Democratic support, including 106 out of 177 Democrats in the House, and 20 out of 42 Democrats in the Senate.Benjamin C. Waterhouse, Lobbying in America, (Princeton University Press, 2013) 53. The law, which is still in effect, banned union contributions to political candidates, restricted the power of unions to call strikes that \\"threatened national security,\\" and forced the expulsion of Communist union leaders (the Supreme Court found the anti- communist provision to be unconstitutional, and it is no longer in force). The unions campaigned vigorously for years to repeal the law but failed. During the late 1950s, the Landrum Griffin Act of 1959 passed in the wake of Congressional investigations of corruption and undemocratic internal politics in the Teamsters and other unions. In 1955, the two largest labor organizations, the AFL and CIO, merged, ending a division of over 20 years. AFL President George Meany became President of the new AFL-CIO, and AFL Secretary-Treasurer William Schnitzler became AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer. The draft constitution was primarily written by AFL Vice President Matthew Woll and CIO General Counsel Arthur Goldberg, while the joint policy statements were written by Woll, CIO Secretary-Treasurer James Carey, CIO vice presidents David McDonald and Joseph Curran, Brotherhood of Railway Clerks President George Harrison, and Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom.Soderstrom, Carl; Soderstrom, Robert; Stevens, Chris; Burt, Andrew (2018).

The percentage of workers belonging to a union (or \\"density\\") in the United States peaked in 1954 at almost 35% (citation needed) and the total number of union members peaked in 1979 at an estimated 21.0 million. Membership has declined since, with private sector union membership beginning a steady decline that continues into the 2010s, but the membership of public sector unions grew steadily. Labor union voting by federal workers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (1948) After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.U.S. Census Bureau, \\"Census Bureau Reports State and Local Government Employment Remains at 16.6 Million\\" (press release Aug. 10, 2010) Adding in the 3.7 million federal civilian employees, in 2010 8.4 million government workers were represented by unions,This includes some people who are covered by union contracts but are not themselves members. including 31% of federal workers, 35% of state workers and 46% of local workers.Bureau of Labor Statistics, \\"Table 3. Union affiliation of employed wage and salary workers by occupation and industry\\" By the 1970s, a rapidly increasing flow of imports (such as automobiles, steel and electronics from Germany and Japan, and clothing and shoes from Asia) undercut American producers. By the 1980s there was a large-scale shift in employment with fewer workers in high-wage sectors and more in the low-wage sectors. Many companies closed or moved factories to Southern states (where unions were weak), countered the threat of a strike by threatening to close or move a plant, or moved their factories offshore to low-wage countries. The number of major strikes and lockouts fell by 97% from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in 2010. On the political front, the shrinking unions lost influence in the Democratic Party, and pro-Union liberal Republicans faded away.Nicol C. Rae, The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present (1989) Union membership among workers in private industry shrank dramatically, though after 1970 there was growth in employees unions of federal, state and local governments.Robert H. Zieger, and Gilbert J. Gall, American Workers, American Unions: The Twentieth Century (3rd ed. 2002); Lawrence Richards, Union-Free America: Workers and Antiunion Culture (2010) The intellectual mood in the 1970s and 1980s favored deregulation and free competition.Martha Derthick and Paul J. Quirk, The Politics of Deregulation (1985) p 218 Numerous industries were deregulated, including airlines, trucking, railroads and telephones, over the objections of the unions involved.Derthick and Quirk, The Politics of Deregulation (1985) pp vii, 11, 104, 137 The climax came when President Ronald Reagan‚Äîa former union president‚Äîbroke the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) strike in 1981, dealing a major blow to unions.Michael Round, Grounded: Reagan and the PATCO Crash (1999) Republicans began to push through legislative blueprints to curb the power of public employee unions as well as eliminate business regulations.Richard B. Freeman and Eunice Han. \\"The war against public sector collective bargaining in the US.\\" Journal of Industrial Relations (2012) 54#3 pp: 386-408. Labor unions today Union members rally to reject union busting in New Orleans (2019) Today most labor unions (or trade unions) in the United States are members of one of two larger umbrella organizations: the American Federation of Labor‚ÄìCongress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) or the Change to Win Federation, which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005-2006. Both organizations advocate policies and legislation favorable to workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics favoring the Democratic party but not exclusively so. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade and economic issues. Private sector unions are regulated by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), passed in 1935 and amended since then. The law is overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency. Public sector unions are regulated partly by federal and partly by state laws. In general they have shown robust growth rates, because wages and working conditions are set through negotiations with elected local and state officials. To join a traditional labor union, workers must either be given voluntary recognition from their employer or have a majority of workers in a bargaining unit vote for union representation. In either case, the government must then certify the newly formed union. Other forms of unionism include minority unionism, solidarity unionism, and the practices of organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World, which do not always follow traditional organizational models. Public sector worker unions are governed by labor laws and labor boards in each of the 50 states. Northern states typically model their laws and boards after the NLRA and the NLRB. In other states, public workers have no right to establish a union as a legal entity. (About 40% of public employees in the USA do not have the right to organize a legally established union.)CQ, \\"Public Employee Unions\\" (2011) onlineAmerican Federation of Government Employees AFGE Local 704, \\"More FAQs\\" 2015 A review conducted by the federal government on pay scale shows that employees in a labor union earn up to 33% more income than their nonunion counterparts, as well as having more job security, and safer and higher-quality work conditions. The median weekly income for union workers was $973 in 2014, compared with $763 for nonunion workers. =Labor negotiations= Once the union won the support of a majority of the bargaining unit and is certified in a workplace, it has the sole authority to negotiate the conditions of employment. Under the NLRA, employees can also, if there is no majority support, form a minority union which represents the rights of only those members who choose to join. Businesses, however, do not have to recognize the minority union as a collective bargaining agent for its members, and therefore the minority union's power is limited. This minority model was once widely used, but was discarded when unions began to consistently win majority support. Unions are beginning to revisit the members-only model of unionism, because of new changes to labor law, which unions view as curbing workers' ability to organize. The employer and the union write the terms and conditions of employment in a legally binding contract. When disputes arise over the contract, most contracts call for the parties to resolve their differences through a grievance process to see if the dispute can be mutually resolved. If the union and the employer still cannot settle the matter, either party can choose to send the dispute to arbitration, where the case is argued before a neutral third party. Worker slogan used during the upright=.6 Right-to-work statutes forbid unions from negotiating union shops and agency shops. Thus, while unions do exist in \\"right-to-work\\" states, they are typically weaker. Members of labor unions enjoy \\"Weingarten Rights.\\" If management questions the union member on a matter that may lead to discipline or other changes in working conditions, union members can request representation by a union representative. Weingarten Rights are named for the first Supreme Court decision to recognize those rights.NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. 251 (1975); Tate & Renner Attorneys at Law The NLRA goes farther in protecting the right of workers to organize unions. It protects the right of workers to engage in any \\"concerted activity\\" for mutual aid or protection. Thus, no union connection is needed. Concerted activity \\"in its inception involves only a speaker and a listener, for such activity is an indispensable preliminary step to employee self-organization.\\"Root-Carlin, Inc., 92 NLRB 1313, 27 LRRM, 1235, citing NLRB v. City Yellow Cab Co. (6th Cir. 1965), 344 F.2d 575, 582; www.workplacefairness.org Unions are currently advocating new federal legislation, the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), that would allow workers to elect union representation by simply signing a support card (card check). The current process established by federal law requires at least 30% of employees to sign cards for the union, then wait 45 to 90 days for a federal official to conduct a secret ballot election in which a simple majority of the employees must vote for the union in order to obligate the employer to bargain. Unions report that, under the present system, many employers use the 45- to 90-day period to conduct anti-union campaigns. Some opponents of this legislation fear that removing secret balloting from the process will lead to the intimidation and coercion of workers on behalf of the unions. During the 2008 elections, the Employee Free Choice Act had widespread support of many legislators in the House and Senate, and of the President. Since then, support for the \\"card check\\" provisions of the EFCA subsided substantially. =Membership= Rise and fall of right Union membership had been declining in the US since 1954, and since 1967, as union membership rates decreased, middle class incomes shrank correspondingly.Madland, Walter, and Bunker, \\"As Union Membership Rates Decrease, Middle Class Incomes Shrink.\\", AFL-CIO, May 24, 2013. In 2007, the labor department reported the first increase in union memberships in 25 years and the largest increase since 1979. Most of the recent gains in union membership have been in the service sector while the number of unionized employees in the manufacturing sector has declined. Most of the gains in the service sector have come in West Coast states like California where union membership is now at 16.7% compared with a national average of about 12.1%. Historically, the rapid growth of public employee unions since the 1960s has served to mask an even more dramatic decline in private-sector union membership. At the apex of union density in the 1940s, only about 9.8% of public employees were represented by unions, while 33.9% of private, non- agricultural workers had such representation. In this decade, those proportions have essentially reversed, with 36% of public workers being represented by unions while private sector union density had plummeted to around 7%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics most recent survey indicates that union membership in the US has risen to 12.4% of all workers, from 12.1% in 2007. For a short period, private sector union membership rebounded, increasing from 7.5% in 2007 to 7.6% in 2008. However, that trend has since reversed. In 2013 there were 14.5 million members in the U.S., compared with 17.7 million in 1983. In 2013, the percentage of workers belonging to a union was 11.3%, compared to 20.1% in 1983. The rate for the private sector was 6.4%, and for the public sector 35.3%.Bureau of Labor Statistics, \\"Union Membership Summary\\" Jan 24, 2014 In the ten years 2005 through 2014, the National Labor Relations Board recorded 18,577 labor union representation elections; in 11,086 of these elections (60 percent), the majority of workers voted for union representation. Most of the elections (15,517) were triggered by employee petitions for representation, of which unions won 9,933. Less common were elections caused by employee petitions for decertification (2792, of which unions won 1070), and employer-filed petitions for either representation or decertification (268, of which unions won 85).Representation petitions, National Labor Relations Board, accessed 10 Oct. 2015.Decertification petitions, National Labor Relations Board, accessed 10 Oct. 2015. =Labor education programs= government shutdown (2019)right In the US, labor education programs such as the Harvard Trade Union Program created in 1942 by Harvard University professor John Thomas Dunlop sought to educate union members to deal with important contemporary workplace and labor law issues of the day. The Harvard Trade Union Program is currently part of a broader initiative at Harvard Law School called the Labor and Worklife Program that deals with a wide variety of labor and employment issues from union pension investment funds to the effects of nanotechnology on labor markets and the workplace. Cornell University is known to be one of the leading centers for labor education in the world, establishing the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations in 1945. The school's mission is to prepare leaders, inform national and international employment and labor policy, and improve working lives through undergraduate and graduate education. The school publishes the Industrial and Labor Relations Review and had Frances Perkins on its faculty. The school has six academic departments: Economics, Human Resource Management, International and Comparative Labor, Labor Relations, Organizational Behavior, and Social Statistics. Classes include \\"Politics of the Global North\\" and \\"Economic Analysis of the University.\\"Rittenhouse, Ed. (1950). School with a Purpose. Journal of Higher Education, 21 (7), 360-362+393 =Jurisdiction= Labor unions use the term jurisdiction to refer to their claims to represent workers who perform a certain type of work and the right of their members to perform such work. For example, the work of unloading containerized cargo at United States ports, which the International Longshoremen's Association, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have claimed rightfully should be assigned to workers they represent. A jurisdictional strike is a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a union to assert its members' right to such job assignments and to protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or to unorganized workers. Jurisdictional strikes occur most frequently in the United States in the construction industry.Hunt, James W. and Strongin, Patricia K. The Law of the Workplace: Rights of Employers and Employees. 3rd ed. Washington, D.C.: BNA Books, 1994. ; Whitney, Nathaniel Rugges. Jurisdiction in American Building-Trades Unions. Charleston, S.C.: BiblioBazaar, 2008 (originally published 1914). Unions also use jurisdiction to refer to the geographical boundaries of their operations, as in those cases in which a national or international union allocates the right to represent workers among different local unions based on the place of those workers' employment, either along geographical lines or by adopting the boundaries between political jurisdictions. =Public opinion= Although not as overwhelmingly supportive as it was from the 1930s through the early 1960s, a clear majority of the American public approves of labor unions. The Gallup organization has tracked public opinion of unions since 1936, when it found that 72 percent approved of unions. The overwhelming approval declined in the late 1960s, but - except for one poll in 2009 in which the unions received a favorable rating by only 48 percent of those interviewed, majorities have always supported labor unions. A Gallup Poll released August 2018 showed 62% of respondents approving unions, the highest level in over a decade. Disapproval of unions was expressed by 32%. On the question of whether or not unions should have more influence or less influence, Gallup has found the public consistently split since Gallup first posed the question in 2000, with no majority favoring either more influence or less influence. In August 2018, 39 percent wanted unions to have more influence, 29 percent less influence, with 26 percent wanting the influence of labor unions to remain about the same.Lydia Saad, Labor Unions, Gallup, accessed 17 May 2019. A Pew Research Center poll from 2009-2010 found a drop of Labor Union support in the midst of The Great Recession, Pew Research sitting at 41% Favorable 40% unfavorable. 8 years later in 2018, Union support rose to 55% Favorable 33% Unfavorable, Pew Research Despite this Union membership had continued to fall., Pew research Possible causes of drop in membership union membership declined income inequality rose.Sources: E McGaughey, 'Do corporations increase inequality?'

Bureau of Labor Statistics, Series D 940‚Äì945 and Thomas Piketty (2014) Technical Appendices, Table S9.2 The US does not require employee representatives on boards of directors, or elected work councils.See further RL Hogler and GJ Grenier, Employee Participation and Labor Law in the American Workplace (1992)right Although most industrialized countries have seen a drop in unionization rates, the drop in union density (the unionized proportion of the working population) has been more significant in the United States than elsewhere. =Global trends= The US Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed the histories of union membership rates in industrialized countries from 1970 to 2003, and found that of 20 advanced economies which had union density statistics going back to 1970, 16 of them had experienced drops in union density from 1970 to 2003. Over the same period during which union density in the US declined from 23.5 percent to 12.4 percent, some counties saw even steeper drops. Australian unionization fell from 50.2 percent in 1970 to 22.9 percent in 2003, in New Zealand it dropped from 55.2 percent to 22.1 percent, and in Austria union participation fell from 62.8 percent down to 35.4 percent. All the English-speaking countries studied saw union membership decline to some degree. In the United Kingdom, union participation fell from 44.8 percent in 1970 to 29.3 percent in 2003. In Ireland the decline was from 53.7 percent down to 35.3 percent. Canada had one of the smallest declines over the period, going from 31.6 percent in 1970 to 28.4 percent in 2003. Most of the countries studied started in 1970 with higher participation rates than the US, but France, which in 1970 had a union participation rate of 21.7 percent, by 2003 had fallen to 8.3 percent. The remaining four countries which had gained in union density were Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium.Jelle Visser, Union membership statistics in 24 countries, Monthly Labor Review, Jan. 2006, p.38-49. =Popularity= Public approval of unions climbed during the 1980s much as it did in other industrialized nations,Sexton, Patricia Cayo. \\"The Decline of the Labor Movement.\\" The Social Movements Reader: Cases and Concepts. Goodwin, Jeff and James M. Jasper, eds. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2003 but declined to below 50% for the first time in 2009 during the Great Recession. It is not clear if this is a long term trend or a function of a high unemployment rate which historically correlates with lower public approval of labor unions.State Of The Unions by James Surowiecki newyorker.com January 17, 2011 One explanation for loss of public support is simply the lack of union power or critical mass. No longer do a sizable percentage of American workers belong to unions, or have family members who do. Unions no longer carry the \\"threat effect\\": the power of unions to raise wages of non-union shops by virtue of the threat of unions to organize those shops. =Polls of public opinion and labor unions= right A New York Times/CBS Poll found that 60% of Americans opposed restricting collective bargaining while 33% were for it. The poll also found that 56% of Americans opposed reducing pay of public employees compared to the 37% who approved. The details of the poll also stated that 26% of those surveyed, thought pay and benefits for public employees were too high, 25% thought too low, and 36% thought about right. Mark Tapscott of the Washington Examiner criticized the poll, accusing it of over-sampling union and public employee households. A Gallup poll released on March 9, 2011, showed that Americans were more likely to support limiting the collective bargaining powers of state employee unions to balance a state's budget (49%) than disapprove of such a measure (45%), while 6% had no opinion. 66% of Republicans approved of such a measure as did 51% of independents. Only 31% of Democrats approved. A Gallup poll released on March 11, 2011, showed that nationwide, Americans were more likely to give unions a negative word or phrase when describing them (38%) than a positive word or phrase (34%). 17% were neutral and 12% didn't know. Republicans were much more likely to say a negative term (58%) than Democrats (19%). Democrats were much more likely to say a positive term (49%) than Republicans (18%). A nationwide Gallup poll (margin of error ¬±4%) released on April 1, 2011, showed the following; * When asked if they supported the labor unions or the governors in state disputes; 48% said they supported the unions, 39% said the governors, 4% said neither, and 9% had no opinion. * Women supported the governors much less than men. 45% of men said they supported the governors, while 46% said they supported the unions. This compares to only 33% of women who said they supported the governors and 50% who said they supported the unions. * All areas of the US (East, Midwest, South, West) were more likely to support unions than the governors. The largest gap being in the East with 35% supporting the governors and 52% supporting the unions, and the smallest gap being in the West with 41% supporting the governors and 44% the unions. * 18- to 34-year-olds were much more likely to support unions than those over 34 years of age. Only 27% of 18- to 34-year-olds supported the governors, while 61% supported the unions. Americans ages 35 to 54 slightly supported the unions more than governors, with 40% supporting the governors and 43% the unions. Americans 55 and older were tied when asked, with 45% supporting the governors and 45% the unions. * Republicans were much more likely to support the governors when asked with 65% supporting the governors and 25% the unions. Independents slightly supported unions more, with 40% supporting the governors and 45% the unions. Democrats were overwhelmingly in support of the unions. 70% of Democrats supported the unions, while only 19% supported the governors. * Those who said they were following the situation not too closely or not at all supported the unions over governors, with a 14‚Äìpoint (45% to 31%) margin. Those who said they were following the situation somewhat closely supported the unions over governors by a 52‚Äì41 margin. Those who said that they were following the situation very closely were only slightly more likely to support the unions over the governors, with a 49-48 margin. right A nationwide Gallup poll released on August 31, 2011, revealed the following: * 52% of Americans approved of labor unions, unchanged from 2010. * 78% of Democrats approved of labor unions, up from 71% in 2010. * 52% of Independents approved of labor unions, up from 49% in 2010. * 26% of Republicans approved of labor unions, down from 34% in 2010. A nationwide Gallup poll released on September 1, 2011, revealed the following: * 55% of Americans believed that labor unions will become weaker in the United States as time goes by, an all-time high. This compared to 22% who said their power would stay the same, and 20% who said they would get stronger. * The majority of Republicans and Independents believed labor unions would further weaken by a 58% and 57% percentage margin respectively. A plurality of Democrats believed the same, at 46%. * 42% of Americans want labor unions to have less influence, tied for the all-time high set in 2009. 30% wanted more influence and 25% wanted the same amount of influence. * The majority of Republicans wanted labor unions to have less influence, at 69%. * A plurality of Independents wanted labor unions to have less influence, at 40%. * A plurality of Democrats wanted labor unions to have more influence, at 45%. * The majority of Americans believed labor unions mostly helped members of unions by a 68 to 28 margin. * A plurality of Americans believed labor unions mostly helped the companies where workers are unionized by a 48-44 margin. * A plurality of Americans believed labor unions mostly helped state and local governments by a 47-45 margin. * A plurality of Americans believed labor unions mostly hurt the US economy in general by a 49-45 margin. * The majority of Americans believed labor unions mostly hurt workers who are not members of unions by a 56-34 margin. =Institutional environments= A broad range of forces have been identified as potential contributors to the drop in union density across countries. Sano and Williamson outline quantitative studies that assess the relevance of these factors across countries.Sano, Joelle and John B. Williamson. (2008) \\"Factors Affecting Union Decline and their Implications for Labor Reform,\\" International Journal of Comparative Sociology 49: 479-500 The first relevant set of factors relate to the receptiveness of unions' institutional environments. For example, the presence of a Ghent system (where unions are responsible for the distribution of unemployment insurance) and of centralized collective bargaining (organized at a national or industry level as opposed to local or firm level) have both been shown to give unions more bargaining power and to correlate positively to higher rates of union density. Unions have enjoyed higher rates of success in locations where they have greater access to the workplace as an organizing space (as determined both by law and by employer acceptance), and where they benefit from a corporatist relationship to the state and are thus allowed to participate more directly in the official governance structure. Moreover, the fluctuations of business cycles, particularly the rise and fall of unemployment rates and inflation, are also closely linked to changes in union density. =Labor legislation= Workers speak in support of the Workplace Democracy Act which makes it easier to unionize (2018) Labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan attributes the drop to the long-term effects of the 1947 Taft- Hartley Act, which slowed and then halted labor's growth and then, over many decades, enabled management to roll back labor's previous gains.The United States of Inequality, Entry 6: The Great Divergence and the death of organized labor.

In general, scholars debate the influence of politics in determining union strength in the US and other countries. One argument is that political parties play an expected role in determining union strength, with left-wing governments generally promoting greater union density, while others contest this finding by pointing out important counterexamples and explaining the reverse causality inherent in this relationship.Ebbinghaus, B. and Visser, J. (1999) \\"When Institutions Matter. Union Growth and Decline in Western Europe, 1950‚Äì1995\\", European Sociological Review 15#2 pp 135‚Äì58 =Economic globalization= More recently, as unions have become increasingly concerned with the impacts of market integration on their well-being, scholars have begun to assess whether popular concerns about a global \\"race to the bottom\\" are reflected in cross-country comparisons of union strength. These scholars use foreign direct investment (FDI) and the size of a country's international trade as a percentage of its GDP to assess a country's relative degree of market integration. These researchers typically find that globalization does affect union density, but is dependent on other factors, such as unions' access to the workplace and the centralization of bargaining.Scruggs, L. and Lange, P. (2002) \\"Where Have all the Members Gone? Globalizations, Institutions, and Union Density,\\" The Journal of Politics 64#1 pp 126‚Äì53. Sano and Williamson argue that globalization's impact is conditional upon a country's labor history.Sano, Joelle and John B. Williamson. (2008) \\"Factors Affecting Union Decline and their Implications for Labor Reform.\\" International Journal of Comparative Sociology 49: 479-500. In the United States in particular, which has traditionally had relatively low levels of union density, globalization did not appear to significantly affect union density. =Employer strategies= Illegal union firing [needs explanation] increased during the Reagan administration and has continued since.Why America Needs Unions , BusinessWeek Studies focusing more narrowly on the U.S. labor movement corroborate the comparative findings about the importance of structural factors, but tend to emphasize the effects of changing labor markets due to globalization to a greater extent. Bronfenbrenner notes that changes in the economy, such as increased global competition, capital flight, and the transitions from a manufacturing to a service economy and to a greater reliance on transitory and contingent workers, accounts for only a third of the decline in union density.Bronfenbrenner, Kate. Organizing to Win: New Research on Union Strategies (Ithaca, N.Y.: ILR Press, 1998) Bronfenbrenner claims that the federal government in the 1980s was largely responsible for giving employers the perception that they could engage in aggressive strategies to repress the formation of unions. Richard Freeman also points to the role of repressive employer strategies in reducing unionization, and highlights the way in which a state ideology of anti-unionism tacitly accepted these strategies Goldfield writes that the overall effects of globalization on unionization in the particular case of the United States may be understated in econometric studies on the subject.Goldfield, Michael. \\"The impact of globalization and neoliberalism on the decline of organized labour in the United States\\" in Labor, Globalization and the State: Workers, women and migrants confront neoliberalism ed. by Banerjee, Debdas and Michael Goldfield, (Routledge, 2007). He writes that the threat of production shifts reduces unions' bargaining power even if it does not eliminate them, and also claims that most of the effects of globalization on labor's strength are indirect. They are most present in change towards a neoliberal political context that has promoted the deregulation and privatization of some industries and accepted increased employer flexibility in labor markets. =Union responses to globalization= Studies done by Kate Bronfenbrenner at Cornell University show the adverse effects of globalization towards unions due to illegal threats of firing.Kate Bronfenbrenner, 'We'll Close', The Multinational Monitor, March 1997, based on the study she directed, '\\"Final Report: The Effects of Plant Closing or Threat of Plant Closing on the Right of Workers to Organize\\"'. Regardless of the actual impact of market integration on union density or on workers themselves, organized labor has been engaged in a variety of strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic- Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.Bolle, Mary Jane. \\"DR-CAFTA Labor Rights Issues.\\" Congressional Research Service Report for Congress Order Code RS22159. 8 Jul 2005. However, Mayer has written that it was precisely unions' opposition to NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor's ability to influence the debate on labor standards in a significant way. During Clinton's presidential campaign, labor unions wanted NAFTA to include a side deal to provide for a kind of international social charter, a set of standards that would be enforceable both in domestic courts and through international institutions. Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a strong voice in the negotiation process. When it became clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an agreement, some critics from the labor movement would not settle for any viable alternatives. In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.Cameron, Maxwell A. and Brian W. Tomlin. The Making of NAFTA: How the Deal was Done. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2000. Graubart writes that, despite unions' open disappointment with the outcome of this labor-side negotiation, labor activists, including the AFL-CIO have used the side agreement's citizen petition process to highlight ongoing political campaigns and struggles in their home countries.Graubart, Jonathan. Legalizing Transnational Activism: The Struggle to Gain Social Change from NAFTA's Citizen Petitions (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2008). He claims that despite the relative weakness of the legal provisions themselves, the side- agreement has served a legitimizing functioning, giving certain social struggles a new kind of standing. Transnational labor regulation Unions have recently been engaged in a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects.O'Brien, Robert. \\"The varied paths to minimum global labour standards.\\" Global Unions? Theory and Strategies of organized labour in the global political economy edited by Jeffrey Harrod and Robert O'Brien, (Routledge, 2002). They worry that these codes could have legitimizing effects on companies that do not actually live up to good practices, and that companies could use codes to excuse or distract attention from the repression of unions. Braun and Gearhart note that although unions do participate in the structure of a number of these agreements, their original interest in codes of conduct differed from the interests of human rights and other non-governmental activists. Unions believed that codes of conduct would be important first steps in creating written principles that a company would be compelled to comply with in later organizing contracts, but did not foresee the establishment of monitoring systems such as the Fair Labor Association. These authors point out that are motivated by power, want to gain insider status politically and are accountable to a constituency that requires them to provide them with direct benefits.Rainer Braun, and Judy Gearhart. \\"Who should code your conduct? Trade union and NGO differences in the fight for workers' rights,\\" Development in Practice 14.1-2 (2004): 183-196. In contrast, activists from the non-governmental sector are motivated by ideals, are free of accountability and gain legitimacy from being political outsiders. Therefore, the interests of unions are not likely to align well with the interests of those who draft and monitor corporate codes of conduct. Arguing against the idea that high union wages necessarily make manufacturing uncompetitive in a globalized economy is labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan. Busting > unions, in the U.S. manner, as the prime way of competing with China and > other countries [does not work]. It's no accident that the social > democracies, Sweden, France, and Germany, which kept on paying high wages, > now have more industry than the U.S. or the UK. ‚Ä¶ [T]hat's what the U.S. and > the UK did: they smashed the unions, in the belief that they had to compete > on cost. The result? They quickly ended up wrecking their industrial > base.Were You Born On The Wrong Continent? by Thomas Geoghegan Unions have made some attempts to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing is not a new phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change.Eder, Mine. \\"The constraints on labour internationalism: contradictions and prospects.\\" in Global Unions? Theory and Strategies of organized labour in the global political economy ed Harrod, Jeffrey and Robert O'Brien, (Routledge, 2002). Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self- interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways that they could not before the advent of widespread market integration. Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational corporation.Herod, Andrew. \\"Organizing globally, organizing locally: union spatial strategy in a global economy.\\" in Global Unions? Theory and Strategies of organized labour in the global political economy ed Harrod, Jeffrey and Robert O'Brien, (Routledge, 2002). Impact A 2018 study in the Economic History Review found that the rise of labor unions in the 1930s and 1940s reduced income inequality. A 2020 study found that congressional representatives were more responsive to the interests of the poor in districts with higher unionization rates. Another 2020 study found an association between state level adoption of parental leave legislation and labor union strength. A 2020 study in the American Journal of Political Science found that when whites obtain union membership, they become less racially resentful.

Mom and Dad is considered the most successful film within its genre of \\"sex hygiene\\" films. Although it faced numerous legal challenges and was condemned by the National Legion of Decency,Hans J. Wollstein, Mom and Dad (1947)\\", AllMovie it became one of the highest-grossing films of the 1940s. The film is regarded as an exploitation film as it was repackaged controversial content designed to establish an educational value that might circumvent U.S. censorship laws. Babb's marketing of his film incorporated old-style medicine show techniques, and used unique promotions to build an audience. These formed a template for his later works, which were imitated by his contemporary filmmakers. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The Academy Film Archive preserved Mom and Dad in 2010. Plot Mom and Dad tells the story of Joan Blake (June Carlson), a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin (Bob Lowell). After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests \\"hygiene books\\" from her mother Sarah Blake (Lois Austin); however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married. The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake (George Eldredge) that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission. The film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair. She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn (Hardie Albright), who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of \\"neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth.\\" Only then is the girl able to confront her mother. The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births ‚Äì one natural and one Caesarian. In some screenings, a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad, and contained images portraying syphilis and venereal disease. Mom and Dad is believed to have had a number of endings, although most typically concluded with the birth of the girl's child, sometimes stillborn and other times put up for adoption.Schaefer, 200. Cast * Hardie Albright ‚Äì Carl Blackburn, the teacher. * Lois Austin ‚Äì Sarah Blake, the mother. * George Eldredge ‚Äì Dan Blake, the father. * June Carlson ‚Äì Joan Blake, the teen-age girl. * Jimmy Clark ‚Äì Joan's brother. * Bob Lowell ‚Äì Jack Griffin, the pilot. * Jane Isbell ‚Äì Mary Lou, Joan's friend. * Jimmy Zaner ‚Äì Allen Curtis, Joan's hometown boyfriend. * Robert Filmer ‚Äì Superintendent McMann. * Willa Pearl Curtis ‚Äì Junella, the Blake family's African-American maid. * Virginia Van ‚Äì Virginia, Dave's girlfriend. * Forrest Taylor ‚Äì Dr. Ashley, the obstetrician. * Jack Roper ‚Äì The coach. The official credits also acknowledge The Four Liphams as well as the California State Champion dancers of the jitterbug. Production Despite the commercially successful run of Babb's debut film, Dust to Dust‚Äîa reworked version of the 1938 film Child Bride‚Äîhis production company Cox and Underwood disbanded, forcing him to form his own unit, Hygienic Productions.Marshall, 242. Having attended a meeting in Burkburnett, Texas, that discussed the alleged impregnations of young women by G.I.s from nearby Sheppard Air Force Base, Babb was inspired to shoot a film based on the subject.Feaster, 109. His future wife Mildred Horn drafted a screenplay which later evolved into Mom and Dad. Babb located 20 investors willing to fund the movie, and hired William Beaudine as director.Briggs. Production of the film cost Babb and his investors a total of $67,001.12. The movie was shot in five separate studios over six days in 1944,Pressbook. and was spread across various Monogram Pictures lots; co-producer J. S. Jossey was a Monogram stockholder. On January 3, 1945, Mom and Dad premiered at the Warner Bros. theatre in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The plot is padded with a large amount of filler. Films of this type were usually produced quickly and at minimal cost, and while filler was sometimes used to increase the production value, the usual motivation was to extend its running time to qualify for feature length status. Eric Schaefer notes that the \\"primary purpose\\" of the plot of Mom and Dad was to \\"serve as the vehicle onto which the spectacle of the clinical reels can be grafted\\", such as the live birth scene. The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also, and many posters for the film promised that \\"You [will] actually SEE the birth of a baby!\\"Schaefer, 106. The dialogue is carefully worded, and uses period euphemisms rather than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time. In particular, at no time does the film specifically mention sexual intercourse or pregnancy. Marketing and presentation In a Washington Post article covering Babb's career, the film critic Kenneth Turan wrote that Mom and Dad did not \\"flourish because of its birth footage or because of its puerile plot, which Babb himself disparages . . . [its] success flowed, rather, from Babb's extraordinary promotional abilities.\\" The film was exhibited across the United States, and over 300 prints were produced.Library of Congress press release In the weeks preceding the screening, local presenters sought to attract the attention of the town's inhabitants by distributing letters to local newspapers and church leaflets protesting against the film's moral basis. This strategy often utilized fabricated letters supposedly written by the mayor of a nearby city, who wished to register concern about local young women in his area who had seen the film and were awakened enough to discuss problems similar to ones of their own.Schaefer, 116. The campaigns were usually orchestrated by employees of either Hygienic or Hallmark Productions, and they nominally based their campaign from information provided by a standard and detailed pressbook containing cast and crew information, as well as other promotional and marketing materials. Babb's marketing strategy centered on overwhelming small towns with advertisements and letters, in an attempt to create a controversial atmosphere. In keeping with his motto of \\"You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em,\\" the film became so ubiquitous that Time wrote that its presentation \\"left only the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life.\\" Poster promoting screenings of Mom and Dad with in-person appearances by Jesse Owens, the athlete and Olympian. The local pitch included a variety of limited screenings, including adults-only showings, viewings segregated by gender, and a live lecture by the \\"Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes\\" which was often placed during the intermission. At any one time, a number of \\"Elliot Forbes\\"es would give simultaneous talks in a number of locations showing the film.Schaefer, 133. In some predominantly African-American areas, Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens was hired to make appearances instead of an actor playing Forbes. The \\"Elliot Forbes\\" actors were usually people local to the production company, sometimes out-of-work performers.Mondor, personal letter. Along with \\"Forbes\\", presentations were often held with \\"nurses\\" in attendance, ostensibly in the event that someone fainted due to the content of the film; such \\"nurses\\" were often hired locally.Friedman, 119. Modern Film Distributors later distributed the film, and sold over forty-five thousand copies of the books Man and Boy and Woman and Girl following Forbes's lecture. The text was written by Babb's wife,McDougal. and was filled with both biological and sexual education materials relevant to the film's subject matter; generating extra profit items for their distributors. The sales of these books netted an estimated $31,000 for the distribution company,Schaefer, 128. while Babb estimated the total sales for all distributions at 40 million copies. Babb insisted that the program be followed closely; a contractual agreement with theaters required that each presentation follow a similar approach. Because the Forbes lecture formed part of the viewing, extra newsreels or short films were not permitted, although previews were allowed. A contractual agreement disallowed matin√©e pricing, set specific times for the segregated viewings, and prohibited the screening of the film on Sundays. Reception Mom and Dad is the third highest-grossing film of the 1940s in dollar value, and returned close to $63 for each dollar invested by its backers.Variety. The Los Angeles Times estimates that the film grossed between $40 million and $100 million,Turan, 22, and it has been cited as the most successful sex hygiene film ever released. It remains the most profitable pre-1960 exploitation film; ranking among the top ten grossing films of both the 1940s and 1950s, even when scaled against those year's mainstream releases.Schaefer, 197. The film was at the center of many high-profile lawsuits and condemnations. The exploitation genre was pitched against numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s, and fought many local censorship battles, and fought bitterly against the motion picture censorship system.Schaefer, 136‚Äì164. It has been claimed that nearly 428 lawsuits were laid against both Babb and Mom and Dad during the film's run. Babb often used the supposed educational value of his films as an offer of defense, and recommended such tactic to theater owners in his pressbooks. One successful challenge was in New York City, where Mom and Dad remained censored until 1956, when the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the censorship board, deciding that human birth did not qualify as \\"indecent\\".Schaefer, 329. According to Modern Film Distributors, as of the end of 1956, the film has been dubbed into a dozen languages and attended by an estimated worldwide attendance figure of over 175 million people, at over 650,000 performances. By then Babb claimed it had played in 47 states (excluding Kansas) and 72 other countries grossing $22 million worldwide. Card Mondor purchased the rights to exhibit the film in New Zealand and Australia during the mid-1960s, almost twenty years after the film's debut. In the late 1970s, a story on Babb by the Press-Enterprise estimated that the film had been dubbed into 18 languages. The film's success spawned a number of imitators, who sought to saturate the market with genre imitations. In particular, Street Corner recycled Babb's plot, substituting a concerned physician for a concerned teacher. In 1948, Universal produced a similar film, The Story of Bob and Sally, but was unable to screen it due to the production code, and eventually sold the rights.Schaefer, 202. The volume of imitations led to the formation of Modern Film Distributors, a group of exploitation filmmakers, in an effort to minimize booking conflicts. In 1969, the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America for a film rating, in order to allow the film be shown in traditional movie theaters; it received an R rating.Feaster, 110.MPAA website The film was such a success that it is still shown decades later around the world. In 2005, a version was added to the National Film Registry. ReferencesNotesBibliography= * Felicia Feaster and Bret Wood, Forbidden Fruit: The Golden Age of Exploitation Film.

ClothingMeaning of the term= The word bespoke derives from the verb bespeak, to speak for something, in the specialised meaning of \\"to give order for it to be made.\\"Bailey, Nathan (1756). An Universal Etymological English Dictionary. R. Ware. Fashion terminology reserves bespoke for individually patterned and crafted men's clothing, analogous to women's haute couture,Art of Textile Designing. Global Media. as opposed to mass-manufactured ready-to-wear (off- the-peg or off-the-rack). The term originated on Savile Row, a street in London considered the \\"Golden Mile of tailoring\\". Bespoke clothing is traditionally cut from a pattern drafted from scratch for the customer, and so differs from ready-to-wear, which is factory made in finished condition and standardised sizes, and from made to measure, which is produced to order from an adjusted block pattern. The opposition of terms did not initially imply that a bespoke garment was necessarily well built, but since the development of ready-to-wear in the beginning of the twentieth century,Ugolini, Laura (2003). Men and Menswear: Sartorial Consumption in Britain 1880‚Äì1939, p. 181. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. bespoke clothing is now more expensive and is generally accompanied by a high quality of construction.In article published in Textile History (Volume 34, Number 2, November 2003 , pp. 192‚Äì213. Ready- to-wear or Made-to-measure? Consumer Choice in the British Menswear Trade) Laura Ugolini concluded that \\"interested and well-informed male consumers generally preferred to buy bespoke suits: while usually more expensive than their ready-made counterparts, these were also perceived to be better quality, better looking, and better value, and therefore most likely to enhance the wearer's sense of self-worth as a manly, discerning and successful consumer\\". While the distinction conferred by haute couture is protected by law in France,A certain number of formal criteria, including the design for private customers with one or more fittings, must be met for a fashion house to use the label and a list of eligible houses is made official every year by the French Ministry of Industry. the British Advertising Standards Authority has ruled it is a fair practice to use the term \\"bespoke\\" for products that do not fully incorporate traditional construction methods. The Savile Row Bespoke Association, a trade group of traditional tailors, disagrees.The tailor Richard Anderson wrote an article in the Telegraph to argue that \\"the ASA has got the ruling wrong\\" (). But it has taken no formal step to challenge the ruling. =Compared to made-to-measure= A gray area has existed between the extremes of bespoke and ready-to-wear since the end of the 19th centuryIn 1895, the Leeds Factory Clothing Co. veered between calling itself \\"manufacturing clothiers\\" and \\"bespoke tailors\\" (cf. ). in which a tailor measures the customer, but the garment is then made to the closest standard size, sometimes in a factory.Benson, John (2003). A Nation of Shopkeepers: Five Centuries of British Retailing, p.102. I.B.Tauris. The distinction made here is between bespoke, created without use of a pre-existing pattern, and made to measure, which alters a standard-sized pattern to fit the customer. Technological change makes this distinction more subtle, since fittings are increasingly required for made-to-measure. A bespoke service may require an individually-cut pattern, which is then kept should further suits be required; made-to-measure measurements are often stored on a computer. Even hand-work, often cited as a benchmark of bespoke, is now increasingly found in made-to- measure garments, while machine-making plays some part in the creation of most bespoke suits. With a bespoke suit, a pattern is designed and made from scratch based on the client's measurements, often from 20+ measurements involving multiple fittings, and takes considerably longer to produce than a made-to-measure garment. This ensures a precise fit, particularly in the shoulders as well as the posture areas. This custom fit is handy for clients with short or long necks, high or low shoulders, excess girth, high hips, large or flat seats, and more. Made-to-measure cannot adjust for these shapes and slopes. In addition, new technologies have allowed for bespoke garments to be made with lean manufacturing practices and digital patterning, making new patterns within minutes and fully bespoke garments in hours, at a price point similar to made to measure or even mass production. =Advertising Standards Authority ruling= In June 2008, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), a British advertising regulator, ruled that an advertisement describing a suit \\"put into a 'working-frame' where it would be cut and sewn by machine\\" as a \\"bespoke suit uniquely made according to your personal measurements & specification\\" was not breaching the Authority's self-proclaimed advertising codes, notably the truthfulness rule, because the use of the term bespoke was not deemed likely to confuse. The ruling was significant in formalising a less traditional definition of bespoke clothing, even though the older distinction with made-to-measure was recognised. The ruling cited the Oxford English Dictionary definition of bespoke as \\"made to order,\\" and considered that despite the fact a bespoke suit was \\"...fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit,\\" while a suit made-to- measure \\"...would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements,\\" \\"both fully bespoke and made-to-measure suits were \\"made to order\\" in that they were made to the customer's precise measurements and specifications, unlike off-the-peg suits.\\" Some, such as the etymologist Michael Quinion, feel the ruling showed that \\"the historic term of art had moved on.\\" Some others concluded that \\"bespoke tailoring has traditionally, if unofficially, meant something more than the dictionary definition allows\\" and that the ASA \\"took a rather ignorant decision to declare that there is no difference between bespoke and made-to- measure.\\" See also * Mass customization * New bespoke movement * Hong Kong Tailors NotesReferencesFurther reading * * Category:Sizes in clothing Category:Fashion design Category:Clothing Category:Clothing industry ","title":"Bespoke tailoring"},{"id":"2474457","title":"Michael Dobson (actor)"},{"id":"2474460","text":"Aurangabad district is one of the thirty-eight districts of Bihar state, India.

Midwives training at Pacific Adventist University. Several Christian professional educational institutions have been opened in the country, such as Christian Leaders' Training College, Divine Word University, Pacific Adventist University and Sonoma Adventist College. Bah√° º√≠ Faith The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Papua New Guinea began after 1916 with a mention by \`Abdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, that Bah√° º√≠s should take the religion there. The first Bah√° º√≠s moved (referred to as \\"Bah√° º√≠ pioneering\\") to Papua New Guinea in 1954. With local converts the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1958. The first National Spiritual Assembly was then elected in 1969. According to the census of 2000, the number of Bah√° º√≠s does not exceed 21,000. But the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated three times more Bah√° º√≠s at 60,000 or 0.9% of the nation in 2005 Either way it is the largest minority religion in Papua New Guinea, albeit a small one. Among its more well known members are the late Margaret Elias and the late Sirus Naraqi. Margaret Elias was the daughter of the first Papua New Guinean woman on the national assembly, and the country's first woman lawyer (in the 1970s). She attended the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women and was given an award in 1995 and 2002 for her many years in the public service, particularly in the national government. She went on to support various initiatives for education. Sirus Naraqi lived and worked in Papua New Guinea from 1977 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1998, doing clinical medical work as well as teaching at the University of Papua New Guinea, where he was given an award in 1999 and had served as a member of the Continental Board of Counsellors in Australasia since 1985. Islam Islam in Papua New Guinea counts for more than 5,000 followers, (most of whom are Sunni) mainly as a result of a recent spike in conversions. Despite being a dominant religion in neighbouring Indonesia, adherents of Islam make up a small segment of the population. Traditional religions Duk-Duk dancers in the Gazelle Peninsula, New Britain, 1913. Ancestor figure with skull, Sepik, Iatmul people.

There are no tamam in the idyllic abode of the ancestors. Religious syncretism is high, with many citizens combining their Christian faith with some traditional indigenous religious practices. New religious movementsCargo cults= Some cargo cults sprang up in Papua New Guinea during the 20th century, including the Taro Cult and the events known as the Vailala Madness. Religious freedom The constitution of Papua New Guinea establishes freedom of religion and religious practice, provided that it does not infringe on the rights of others or of the public interest. There is no state religion, although the preamble to the constitution mentions \\"the Christian principles\\" the country is founded upon. Parliament sessions and most official government functions open and close with Christian prayer. Since 2016, the government has pursued programs to increase the partnership between churches and the state, including subsidies to churches and the establishment of church councils to assist in local governance.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Papua New GuineaUS Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious groups are required to register the government in order to hold property and obtain tax-exempt status. Foreign missionaries are allowed into the country on special work visas with lower fees than other visa categories. Churches operate roughly half of the educational and medical institutions in the country, and receive government subsidies to provide these services. Public schools provide one hour of non- compulsory religious education per week; in practice, few students opt out of these lessons. Government officials have discussed plans to make religious education compulsory, but as of the end of 2017, these were not implemented. Religious leaders have stated that religious groups are generally able to practice their religion without interference. However, there have been multiple incidences of Muslim refugees and asylum seekers being the targets of stabbings. Other Muslim residents of Papua New Guinea have not faced such attacks.

Life Claudet was born in La Croix-Rousse son of Claude Claudet, a cloth merchant and Etiennette Julie Montagnat, was active in Great Britain and died in London. He was a student of photography pioneer Louis Daguerre. Claudet headed a glass factory at Choisy-le-Roi together with Georges Bontemps and moved to England to promote the factory with a shop in High Holborn, London. Having acquired a share in L. J. M. Daguerre's invention, he was one of the first to practice daguerreotype portraiture in England, and he improved the sensitizing process by using chlorine (instead of bromine) in addition to iodine, thus gaining greater rapidity of action. He also invented the red (safe) dark-room light, and it was he who suggested the idea of using a series of photographs to create the illusion of movement. The idea of using painted backdrops is also attributed to him. Ada Byron's daguerreotype by Claudet c. 1843 From 1841 to 1851 he operated a studio on the roof of the Adelaide Gallery (now the Nuffield Centre), behind St. Martin's in the Fields church, London. In 1843 he took one of only two surviving photographs of Ada Lovelace. He opened subsequent studios at the Colosseum in Regent's Park (1847‚Äì1851) and at 107 Regent Street (1851‚Äì1867). It has been estimated that he made 1,800 pictures every year with subjects including Michael Faraday and Charles Babbage His daguerreotype of Hemi Pomara, in the National Library of Australia, is the oldest known photograph of any MƒÅori person. In 1848 he produced the photographometer, an instrument designed to measure the intensity of photogenic rays; and in 1849 he brought out the focimeter, for securing a perfect focus in photographic portraiture. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1853, and in 1858 he produced the stereomonoscope, in reply to a challenge from Sir David Brewster. In 1851 he moved his business to 107 Regent Street, where he established what he called a \\"Temple to Photography.\\" Claudet received many honours, among which was the appointment, in 1853, as \\"Photographer-in-ordinary\\" to Queen Victoria, and the award, ten years later, of an honor from Napoleon III of France. He died in London in 1867 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery. Less than a month after his death, his \\"Temple to photography\\" was burnt down, and most of his valuable photographs were lost.

The town's population is about 2,660 (2004). Administratively it belongs to ≈öwidnik County of the Lublin Voivodeship. It lies 16 km southeast of ≈öwidnik.  History  Exaltation of the Holy Cross church The first mention of the village located near the site of the current town and called Pogorza≈Çy Staw comes from the 1401 document. The first specific mention of Piaski occurs in the Latin chronicle of Jan D≈Çugosz from 1470 which calls the town \\"Pyassek alias Gyelczew\\" (alias here meaning formerly), where Gie≈Çczew is the name of another local village. Based on this evidence, it is thought that the town of Piaski came into existence some time in the first half of the 15th century on the lands formerly belonging to those two villages. Administratively, Piaski was located in the Lublin Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. In 1509 Polish King Sigismund I the Old established two annual fairs in Piaski, as well as weekly markets.≈öladami Kr√≥la Jana, Rybczewice, 2013, p. 53-54 (in Polish and English) As a result of the Reformation, in the 16th century, apart from the Catholic church, there were three Protestant churches in the town: Calvinist, Arian, and Lutheran.≈öladami Kr√≥la Jana, p. 54 In the 16th and 17th centuries a significant part of the town's population was Protestant, hence it became known as Piaski Luterskie (Lutheran). In 1795 during the Third Partition of Poland, the town became part of Habsburg Austria. In 1809 it briefly passed to the Polish Duchy of Warsaw, before becoming part of Congress Poland under Russian rule from 1815 onward. The town saw a significant influx of Jewish settlers as a result of Russian discriminatory policies, and the Jewish community grew to eventually constitute two thirds of the town's population. In 1869 Piaski lost its municipal rights as punishment for the January Uprising. After World War I, since 1918 it has belonged to reconstituted sovereign Poland, and then Polish cultural life was revived. After the Polish decisive victory in the Battle of Warsaw (1920) against the invading Russians, the Polish Riflemen's Association was established for local youth. Its pupils later joined the Polish underground resistance movement, including the Home Army, during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. In 1921, Piaski had 2,674 Jews among its 3,974 inhabitants. =World War II= During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Germany raided the town four times in September 1939. A dozen or so people were killed, and many buildings were destroyed, however, thanks to firefighters and civil defense the damage was limited. The town was flooded by refugees fleeing the western regions of Poland after the German invasion. During the German occupation of Poland, the town became part of the semi-colonial General Government, established by the Nazi German regime in central Poland. At the beginning of this period, 4,165 Jews resided in Piaski. After the brief Soviet occupation in September 1939, many Jews fled east with the Soviet army. In 1940 the Nazi German occupiers established the Piaski ghetto, to imprison not only its Jewish inhabitants, but also several thousand Jews transported from the Lublin Ghetto, the German Reich and German-occupied Czechia. In addition to housing Piaski Jews, Piaski was a transit ghetto where thousands of Jews were located on their way to the death at the nearby Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp.https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn507303 Severe overcrowding, hunger, and the lack of a secure water supply and sanitation led to a typhus epidemic in late 1941 that killed as many as 1500 ghetto residents. In early 1942, thousands of Jews were marched to nearby Trawniki and many died there en route to Belzec. The Polish underground resistance movement organized secret help for Jews through the Council to Aid Jews, better known as ≈ªegota. In the second half of 1942, remaining Piaski Jews were taken to Trawniki and then by Holocaust trains to Sobibor where they were immediately murdered. The liquidation of the ghetto was aided by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 from Hamburg. The number of Piaski Jews who survived is unknown, but the Jewish community ceased to exist.Browning 1998, pp. 51‚Äì53. After the war, the Podsiad≈Ço and Jarosz families were acknowledged for their help for Jews and named Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. The Posiad≈Çys for protecting Kurt Ticho Thomas who had escaped from Sobibor, and the Jarosz family, whose members were part of the Polish underground resistance, for helping several Jews in various ways. =Recent period= In 1993 Piaski recovered its municipal rights, officially becoming a town again after a break of over a hundred years. Monument to partisan J√≥zef Franczak In 2007 a monument to J√≥zef Franczak, the last partisan of the anti-communist resistance in Poland, who is buried at the local cemetery, was unveiled in Piaski.  Facilities  Near Piaski there is a TV transmission site, with a guyed mast, one of the tallest in Poland.

In 1925, Kent won the Miss Hollywood Beauty Pageant. Career Kent was born Barbara Cloutman on December 16, 1907 in Gadsby, Alberta, to Lily Louise (n√©e Kent) and Jullion Curtis Cloutman. In 1925, she graduated from Hollywood High School and went on to win the Miss Hollywood Pageant. It was also the year in which she began her Hollywood career with a small role for Universal Studios, which signed her to a contract. A petite brunette who stood less than five feet tall, Kent became popular as a comedian opposite such stars as Reginald Denny. She made a strong impression as the heroine pitted against Greta Garbo's femme fatale in Flesh and the Devil in 1926 after Universal had lent Kent to MGM to make the film. She then attracted the attention of audiences and censors the following year in No Man's Law by appearing to swim nude. She actually wore a flesh-colored moleskin bathing suit in scenes that were considered very daring at the time. The popularity of that film led to her selection as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars for 1927. She made a smooth transition into talking pictures opposite Harold Lloyd in the 1929 comedy Welcome Danger. Kent was also featured with Lloyd in his iconic Feet First. Over the next few years, she remained popular and received critical praise in 1933 for her role in the film version of Oliver Twist. Kent married talent agent Harry Edington in Yuma, Arizona, on December 16, 1932‚Äîher 25th birthday. During a one-year hiatus, Edington groomed Kent for what he intended to be a high-profile career. By the time she returned to films, however, her popularity had waned and she was unable to reestablish herself. She made her last appearance on screen in 1935. Later years Following the death of her husband in 1949, Kent retreated from public life. She married Jack Monroe, an engineer, in 1954. They lived in Sun Valley, Idaho, later settling in Palm Desert, California. She died in 2011 at 103 years of age. Hobbies Kent had a great love for the outdoors. Always active, she enjoyed golf, fly fishing, hunting, and gardening. She was a longtime member of Marakkesh, Sunland, and Thunderbird Country Clubs. She was known as a talented cook and loved entertaining friends and family. Kent continued to fly light aircraft until her 85th birthday and was still playing golf well into her mid-90s.

The bill went to Armed Services Committees of both the House and Senate in January 1948. However, there were opponents in the House who believed that women should serve in reserve capacity only. The leaders of the opposition were Walter G. Andrews, House Armed Services Committee chairman, and Carl Vinson, the committee's ranking minority member. According to Bettie Morden: \\"These men believed that women should not be admitted to the Regular Army until their peacetime service could be studied and observed.\\" A counterattack was organized. When the House Armed Services Committee met for hearings on the bill on February 18, 1948, high-ranking civilian and military officials attended to argue for approval of the bill. They included Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and General Hoyt Vandenberg. For two further days, the chairman led a thorough analysis, section by section, of the bill; he questioned Women's Army Corps Director Col. Mary Hallaren and the Army's Assistant Chief of Staff Gen. Willard Paul over its contents. On March 23, 1948, The committee rejected regular status and rewrote and re-titled the bill as the \\"Women's Armed Services Reserve Act of 1948.\\" On April 21, 1948, the Women's Armed Services Reserve Act reached the House floor. Supporters and opposition both had a chance to argue the bill. Voting on the revised act passed and it was sent to the Senate. But the Senate would not accept the revised bill. In May, an joint committee was convened to attempt to reach a compromise. The decaying situation internationally strengthened the argument for women's regular status. > The Russians had gained political control over Czechoslovakia and had > restricted rail and highway traffic into West Berlin. These cold war > developments and the Army's inability to recruit enough men for an all- > volunteer force led President Truman to ask for a peacetime draft. Some > politicians, reluctant to vote for the draft, did not want their > constituents to believe they had turned down a potential source of > volunteers--women. For this reason, many congressmen changed their minds > about permitting women to enter the Regular Army. On May 19, 1948, the House relented and agreed to women serving in both the regular and reserve components of the armed services. The original wording of the bill was restored with two amendments: a limit on the number of women in regular status between 1948 and 1950 and provision that female officers would be commissioned in multiple increments instead of just one. Morden states that \\"House members were satisfied that these amendments would deter indiscriminate commissioning and enlisting of women and prevent any suggestion of favored treatment.\\" On May 26, the Senate unanimously approved the bill. The House approved it on June 2 with a vote of 206 to 133. President Truman signed the bill on June 12, 1948. The Navy swore in its first six women enlistees on July 7, 1948, and later that year commissioned as a lieutenant commander Frances Lois Willoughby, who had served in World War II in the Naval Reserve, its first female doctor. Hundreds began basic training in the Army before the end of the year. The Marine Corps launched its program by inducting some of its women reservists and those who served in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in World War II. The New York Times referred to them as \\"'Marinettes'\\". Despite the passage of the act, the Army established, in October 1949, a regulation that mothers with dependent children were ineligible to serve in the military, and female servicewomen with children under the age of 18 were to be discharged. This regulation remained in place until federal legislation in the 1970s established the inclusion of women with children in the armed forces. In 1998, a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Women's Armed Services Act was held at the Women in Military Service for America (WIMSA) Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. Deputy Secretary of Defense John J. Hamre delivered the keynote address.

She was named for Montgomery Sicard. History Sicard was laid down on 18 June 1919 by the Bath Iron Works; launched on 20 April 1920; sponsored by Mrs. M.H. Sicard, daughter-in-law of Rear Admiral Sicard; and commissioned on 9 June 1920, Lt. J.K. Davis in temporary command. On 18 June 1920, her regularly appointed commanding officer, Lt. Cmdr. G.C. Dichman, took command; and, on 26 June, the ship joined Destroyer Squadrons, Atlantic Fleet at Newport, Rhode Island. She operated on the east coast and in the Caribbean and Panama Canal Zone areas until 1922, engaging in battle and torpedo practice and fleet maneuvers and receiving necessary repairs at the New York Navy Yard. On 20 January 1921, she transited the Panama Canal and participated in combined Atlantic and Pacific Fleet war games and maneuvers in the Pacific, cruising to Callao, Peru, and returning to the Atlantic on 24 February. Arriving at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 27 April 1922 from spring maneuvers in the West Indies, Sicard was repaired and fitted out for duty on the Asiatic Station. On 15 June, she proceeded to Newport, received torpedo equipment; and, on the 20th, got underway with her squadron for her new station, sailing via the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. The squadron arrived at Chefoo, China, on 26 August, and joined the Asiatic Fleet, with which she operated for seven years, based at Chefoo and Tsingtao in the summer and Manila in the winter. She received periodic overhauls at the Cavite Navy Yard. She participated in fleet exercises and maneuvers, protected American interests in China, Japan, and the Philippines, and engaged in escort and patrol duty on the China Coast and on the Yangtze River during periods of unrest. On 30 and 31 August 1923, when violent earthquakes destroyed a large part of the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama, Japan, the Commander in Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Edwin Anderson, Jr., dispatched all available vessels to that area with emergency supplies to render assistance. Sicard arrived in Yokohama harbor on 11 September and acted as dispatch boat to Tokyo and transported refugees from the city. From 25 September to 3 October, she was stationed in Nagasaki harbor as relay ship, since all radio communications to Yokohama and Tokyo were out of commission. The prompt action of Sicard and other units of the Asiatic Fleet helped save thousands of lives and earned the thanks of the Japanese government. Between 26 April and 30 June 1924, Sicard again saw special duty, in connection with the flight of four United States Army airplanes around the world. The destroyer cruised from Hong Kong to Rangoon, Burma, and Calcutta, India, guarding the flight and maintaining radio communications. During the next few years, Sicard's patrols in Chinese waters became more frequent due to the fighting which accompanied Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang prevailing over warlords. On 22 July 1929, having been relieved by another squadron, Sicard and her squadron sailed from Yokohama, Japan, for the United States and arrived at San Diego on 17 August. In October 1929, Sicard joined Destroyer Squadrons, United States Battle Fleet, and for several years operated principally on the west coast of the United States, with periodic overhauls at the Mare Island Navy Yard. She engaged in fleet concentration problems and battle and torpedo practice; towed targets for submarines and air squadrons; performed plane guard duty and made Naval Reserve training cruises. During the period 15 February to 21 June 1930, Sicard made a cruise to the Atlantic with the Battle Fleet, participating in the United States Fleet concentration and Fleet Problem X in Caribbean waters and visiting New York and Hampton Roads for the Presidential Review on 20 May. She took part in fleet problems conducted in the Canal Zone and Caribbean area from 4 February to 15 April 1931 and in Hawaiian waters from 1 February to 22 March 1932. From 24 March to 1 October 1934, Sicard was attached to Rotating Reserve Squadron 20 at San Diego. On 1 October, she joined Destroyer Squadron 4 and continued operations with the Battle Force in the Pacific. On 12 May 1935, while engaging in Fleet Problem XVI off Diamond Head, Oahu, Sicard was rammed by Lea (DD-118) and badly damaged. The ship was towed by Rail (AM-26) to the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard, where she received extensive repairs before resuming operations with her squadron in August. World War II In May 1937, Sicard entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for conversion to a light minelayer; and, on 20 June, she was reclassified DM-21. Except for a brief trip to the west coast for repairs and training from 20 September to 20 December 1937, Sicard operated in the Hawaiian area through 1941, engaging in division tactics and training exercises, fleet problems and maneuvers, joint Army and Navy exercises, battle, torpedo and mining practice, and reconnaissance missions around Midway and outlying islands. She entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard on 21 November 1941 and was under overhaul there when the Japanese attacked on 7 December. The ship had ammunition only for her .30-caliber machine guns but aided in the defense of the base by sending men to help operate the guns of the cruiser New Orleans (CA-32) and the destroyer Cummings (DD-365). On completion of overhaul on 28 January 1942, Sicard left Pearl Harbor for an antisubmarine patrol station southwest of Oahu, where she escorted ships within her area and searched for hostile submarines. Between 1 and 9 April, she helped lay a large defensive minefield at the French Frigate Shoals, some 500 miles northwest of Oahu; and, between 10 and 18 April, she set up a Marine radio and surveillance station at Eastern Island in the Midway group. On 19 June, Sicard sailed from Pearl Harbor with other light minelayers, picked up mines at Seattle, Washington; and, in July, laid a defensive minefield off Kodiak, Alaska. On her return to Hawaii on 27 July, she resumed her local patrol assignment. She sailed on 16 September for the Aleutian Islands to lay another minefield and conduct more patrols and then proceeded on 22 November to San Francisco for overhaul. Sicard after her collision with , 19 May 1943. After completion of repairs on 22 December, Sicard participated in amphibious landing exercises off San Diego; and then sailed on 24 April 1943 from San Francisco with a convoy of troop transports for the assault on Attu in the Aleutians. Sicard was to have acted as a landing craft control vessel for the operation; but, on the night before the landing, she collided with the destroyer, Macdonough (DD-351), in a dense fog. Sicard towed McDonough into Adak, and then proceeded to San Francisco for repairs, which lasted to 29 July. She was more fortunate during the Kiska landings and successfully guided the waves of assault boats to the beach there between 15 and 18 August. She performed local patrol and escort duties in the Aleutians, and then escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 15 September. Sicard in 1944. Sicard left Pearl Harbor on 24 September for a new area of operations, the Southwest Pacific. She escorted ships to Noum√©a and Espiritu Santo, and then continued to Purvis Bay where she and her sisters, Gamble (DM-15) and Breese (DM-18), formed a fast mine-laying group. The group sortied on 31 October to plant an offensive minefield off Bougainville Island. Just as the group completed its mission and began to retire early in the morning of 2 November, it was illuminated by parachute flares from enemy aircraft. Soon a friendly cruiser force steamed by at high speed in the opposite direction and opened fire on an invisible enemy. Sicard's group had unknowingly helped bring the opposing forces together for the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay. Sicard with four other destroyer- minelayers, laid another minefield off Bougainville on 8 November; and, after brief convoy duty, the ship laid a third minefield off the Shortland Islands on 24 November. Between December 1943 and April 1944, she escorted convoys between Espiritu Santo, Guadalcanal, Purvis Bay, Noumea, Fiji, New Zealand, and Kwajalein. On 1 May 1944, she resumed her minelaying role and laid a field off Buka Island in two trips on 2 and 10 May. After additional convoy duty, the ship returned to Alameda, California, on 11 July 1944 for overhaul. Sicard completed repairs on 20 September and, after refresher training, sailed for Pearl Harbor on 4 October. Following another period of upkeep from 10 October to 16 November, she commenced duty training submarines. She conducted daily exercises with submarines off Oahu until 9 January 1945, and then performed similar duties at Midway until 2 September 1945. During this period, she was reclassified a miscellaneous auxiliary, AG-100, effective 5 June 1945. On completion of training duty, Sicard arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard for inactivation on 21 October. Fate She was decommissioned on 21 November 1945, struck from the Navy list on 19 December 1945, and sold on 22 June 1946 to Hugo Neu of New York for scrap. Honors and awards Sicard received two battle stars for her World War II service. Postscript As of 2009, no other ship has been named USS Sicard.

Professional chemist Olsen was born 28 February 1891 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Following education in Canada, he began his professional career in 1917 as chief chemist for the Aetna Explosives Company of Gary, Indiana. When Aetna went out of business following World War I, Olsen worked at Picatinny Arsenal from 1919 to 1929 devising a remanufacturing process to preserve deteriorating military inventories of smokeless powder in artillery ammunition manufactured during World War I. He was then employed by the Western Cartridge Company of East Alton, Illinois, where he patented the Ball Powder¬Æ manufacturing process in 1933. Western Cartridge Company became an Olin Corporation subsidiary in 1944, and Olsen was appointed Olin's vice president for Research and Development in 1952. Art antiquities Olsen and his wife, the former Florence Quittenton, were collectors of Coptic art, Pre-Columbian art, African Art, Modern Art and early Chinese art. He was also the original purchaser of Jackson Pollock's \\"Blue Poles.\\" Being friends with Pollock, Isamu Noguchi, Mark Rothko and other artists, Olsen bought many of their works. Following his retirement from Olin Corporation in 1956, they purchased a winter home in Antigua from which they explored the ancient Arawak realm. They traveled the rivers of Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela in dugout canoes. They also found Arawak artifacts on 22 of 27 Caribbean islands they visited.  Olsen House  He commissioned a house designed by Tony Smith in Guilford, Connecticut on a pink granite outcrop above Long Island Sound, that was completed in 1953; Olsen's needs were a gallery to display his art, guest accommodations for visiting artists and their living quarters. Olsen found the house as Smith envisaged it, in some ways unlivable, but liked it enough to make it his principal home. Within a year Olsen made modifications which devastated Smith who built only one more house, later devoting himself to sculpture, his main claim to fame. In 1998 the artistic couple Jeff Preiss and Rebecca Quaytman stumbled on the house which was for sale. Threatened with destruction by a developer, a campaign by Marjorie Olsen, the collector's daughter-in-law, enabled Preiss and Quaytman to purchase the house. Terence Riley, the chief architecture and design curator at The Modern, ranked the house \\"among the best examples of post-World War II American domestic architecture\\". Renovations were made to restore the sculptural clarity of Smith's vision. It is less than a mile away from another Smith house built for Fred Olsen, Jr. Olsen received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1985.

The team's first choice strip was red shirts, black shorts and red socks. Their second strip was gold and black shirts, black shorts and black socks. They used to play their football at Cardiff Athletics Stadium in Leckwith. The Quins were formed in 1935, and progressed in the 1990s from 'parks' football into the Welsh League, via the FAW Pyramid system. The club won the Welsh League Challenge Cup in 1995. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, they played in the Welsh Premier League. However, a lack of finances and fan support led to the departure of key players, leaving the club to rely on youth and reserve players. The 'Quins' remained rooted to the bottom of the table, and never looked able to avoid relegation. A second relegation followed in 2006‚Äì07, and the club's prospects of returning to the Premier in the short term looked slim. With the demolition of the old Cardiff Athletics Stadium in 2007 Grange Quins lost their home ground. Because a replacement was not due to be completed until late 2009 the Quins had nowhere to play and, in any case, were considering withdrawing from the Welsh League because of the far higher costs of playing at the new Cardiff International Sports Stadium. The club had a long-standing rivalry with fellow Cardiff side Cardiff Corinthians which dated back to the 1980s, when both clubs were fierce cross-city rivals and took part in some mouth-watering fixtures. Both clubs have rarely been in the same division, but the rivalry resumed in 2014‚Äì15 with the Corinthians relegation to Division 3. In 2014‚Äì15 the Cardiff Grange Harlequins resigned from the Welsh League towards the end of the season, and their record was expunged. The team continued to play in the Cardiff & District League for a season, though with none of the players that played in the Welsh League, using the park facilities at Pontcanna Fields as their home ground.

Its formation is usually caused by the intrusion of energy and wind from the mid- latitudes into the tropics. It can also develop from the inverted trough adjacent to an upper level anticyclone. TUTTs are different from mid-latitude troughs in the sense that they are maintained by subsidence warming near the tropopause which balances radiational cooling. When strong, they can present a significant vertical wind shear to the tropics and subdue tropical cyclogenesis. When upper cold lows break off from their base, they tend to retrograde and force the development, or enhance, surface troughs and tropical waves to their east. Under special circumstances, they can induce thunderstorm activity and lead to the formation of tropical cyclones. Location The TUTT is elongated from east-northeast to west-southwest across oceans of the Northern Hemisphere, and west-northwest to east-southeast across oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. In the South Pacific, it stretches from near the equator at the 175th meridian west to the east-southeast near 30N 105W, offshore the western South American coast. In the South Atlantic, the TUTT extends from near the equator at the 75th meridian west east-southeast to 30N 15W, offshore the western coast of southern Africa. In the North Atlantic, the TUTT is oriented from 35N 30W (south of the Azores) to 22N 95W (the southern Gulf of Mexico). In the North Pacific, it stretches from 35N 145W (offshore western North America) to 22N 135E, offshore the northeast coast of the Philippines. Effects within the tropics TUTTs sometimes brings a large amount of vertical wind shear over tropical disturbances in the deep tropics and cyclones and thus hinder their development.Glenn White. Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough‚ÄîJuly 2001. Retrieved on 2008-11-25. However, there are cases that TUTTs assist the genesis and intensification of tropical cyclones by providing additional forced ascent near the storm center and an efficient outflow channel in the upper troposphere. This is most likely near its most westward and equatorward periphery. Upper lows pinching off from their base Under specific circumstances, upper cold lows can break off from the base of the TUTT. These upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices usually move slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest, and generally do not extend below 20,000 feet in altitude. A weak inverted wave in the easterlies is generally found underneath them, and they may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of cumulus clouds and the appearance of a surface vortex. In rare cases, they become warm-core, resulting in the vortex becoming a tropical cyclone. Upper cyclones and upper troughs which trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification process. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone.

The sole member of its genus, the oribi was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1782. Eight subspecies are identified. The oribi reaches nearly at the shoulder and weighs . This antelope features a slightly raised back, and long neck and limbs. The glossy, yellowish to rufous brown coat contrasts with the white chin, throat, underparts and rump. Only males possess horns; the thin, straight horns, long, are smooth at the tips and ringed at the base. Typically diurnal, the oribi is active mainly during the day. Small herds of up to four members are common; males defend their group's territory, large. The oribi is primarily a grazer, and prefers fresh grasses and browses occasionally. A seasonal breeder, the time when mating occurs varies geographically. Unlike all other small antelopes, oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems, depending on the habitat ‚Äì polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry. Gestation lasts for six to seven months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The oribi occurs in a variety of habitats ‚Äì from savannahs, floodplains and tropical grasslands with tall grasses to montane grasslands at low altitudes, up to above the sea level. This antelope is highly sporadic in distribution, ranging from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east and southward to Angola and the Eastern Cape (South Africa). The oribi has been classified as Least Concern by the IUCN; numbers have declined due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock. Taxonomy Illustration The scientific name of the oribi is Ourebia ourebi. The sole member of its genus, the oribi is placed under the family Bovidae. The species was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1782. The oribi was formerly included in the tribe Neotragini, that comprised a variety of other dwarf antelopes, including Dorcatragus (beira), Madoqua (dik dik), Neotragus, Oreotragus (klipspringer) and Raphicerus. In 1963, German mammalogist Theodor Haltenorth separated the oribi and Raphicerus into a new tribe, Raphicerini; later on, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon assigned the oribi to Ourebini, a tribe of its own. The common name \\"oribi\\" comes from the Afrikaans name for the animal, oorbietjie. In a revision of the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini on the basis of nuclear and mitochondrial data in 2013, Eva Verena B√§rmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues showed that the oribi is the sister taxon to all other antilopines. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study. The following eight subspecies are identified: *O. o. dorcas Schwarz, 1914 *O. o. gallarum Blaine, 1913 *O. o. haggardi (Thomas, 1895) ‚Äì Occurs in eastern Africa. Listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. *O. o. hastata (Peters, 1852) ‚Äì Ranges from Kenya southward into Mozambique and eastward into Angola *‚Ä† O. o. kenyae Meinhertzhagen, 1905 ‚Äì Occurred on the lower slopes of Mount Kenya. *O. o. montana (Cretzschmar, 1826) ‚Äì Ranges from northern Nigeria eastward into Ethiopia and southward into Uganda. *O. o. ourebi (Zimmermann, 1783) ‚Äì Its range lies south of Zambezi River. *O. o. quadriscopa (C. H. Smith, 1827) ‚Äì Occurs in western Africa *O. o. rutila Blaine, 1922 Of these, zoologists Colin Groves and Peter Grubb identify O. o. hastata, O. o. montana, O. o. ourebi and O. o. quadriscopa as independent species in their 2011 publication Ungulate Taxonomy. Description The oribi is a small, slender antelope; it reaches nearly at the shoulder and weighs . The head-and-body length is typically between . Sexually dimorphic, males are slightly smaller than females (except for O. o. ourebi, in which females are smaller). This antelope features a slightly raised back, and long neck and limbs. The glossy, yellowish to rufous brown coat contrasts with the white chin, throat, underparts and rump. The bushy tail, brown to black on the outside, has white insides (except in O. o. hastata, that has a completely black tail). The subspecies show some variation in colouration; O. o. ourebi is a rich rufous, while O. o. hastata is yellower. Only males possess horns; the thin, straight horns, long, are smooth at the tips and ringed at the base. The maximum horn length, , was recorded in 1998 from Malawi. The oribi has at least six different, well-developed scent glands (such as the prominent preorbital glands near the eyes). The body has several modifications, such as the large fossae below the eyes, to accommodate such a large number of glands. Females have four teats. Ecology and behaviour A male (left) and small group of females The oribi is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though some activity may also be observed at night. The animal rests in cover during rain events. Unlike all other small antelopes, oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems, depending on the habitat ‚Äì polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry; polygyny tends to prevail as the female-to-male ratio increases. A study suggested that polygyny is preferred in areas of high predator risk, as it leads to formation of groups as an anti-predator measure. Small herds of up to four members are also common. Males defend their group's territory, large; female members may also show some aggression and drive away intruders. A study showed that the number of females that visit the male's territory depends on the appearance (particularly the symmetry) of the male's horns. Males mark vegetation and soil in their territories by preorbital gland secretions and excrement; the intensity of marking increases with the number of male neighbours. Dominant males tend to have greater access to females in and around the territory than other males. An important feature of the social behaviour of oribi is the \\"dung ceremony\\", in which all animals form temporary dung middens. Oribi at least three months old have been observed giving out one to three alarm whistles on sensing danger. These whistles are more common in adults than in juveniles, and males appear to whistle more. Common predators include carnivorans such as jackals. =Diet= Primarily a grazer, the oribi prefers fresh grasses and browses occasionally. Grasses can constitute up to 90% of the diet; preferred varieties include Andropogon, Eulalia, Hyparrhenia, Loudetia, Pennisetum and Themeda species. Mineral licks are also visited regularly. Oribi have been observed feeding on flowers and Boletus mushrooms. Groups of oribi congregate in the rainy season, when grasses are abundant. =Reproduction= Both sexes become sexually mature at 10 to 14 months. A seasonal breeder, the time when mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season (August to September). When a female enters oestrus (which lasts for four to six days), it seeks the company of males. During courtship, the male will pursue the female, test her urine to check if she is in oestrus and lick her rump and flanks. Gestation lasts for six to seven months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. The newborn is kept in concealment for nearly a month; the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour. Males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The oribi lives for 8 to 12 years in the wild, and for 12 to 14 years in captivity. Distribution and habitat Oribi occur in tropical grasslands at W National Park, Niger The oribi occurs in a variety of habitats ‚Äì from savannahs, floodplains and tropical grasslands with tall grasses to montane grasslands at low altitudes, up to above the sea level. Recently burnt areas often attract groups of oribi. The choice of habitat depends on the availability of cover needed to escape the eyes of predators. Population densities typically vary between 2 and 10 individuals per km2; however, densities as high as 45 individuals per km2 have been recorded in tropical grasslands that receive over of annual rainfall and open floodplains. The oribi's range overlaps with those of larger grazers such as the African buffalo, hippopotamus, hartebeest, Thomson's gazelle and topi. These separate species often occur in close proximity to each other, increasing predator vigilance. This antelope is highly sporadic in distribution; it occurs mainly in eastern, southern and western Africa, ranging from Nigeria and Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east and southward to Angola and the Eastern Cape (South Africa). It is feared to be extinct in Burundi. Threats and conservation The oribi has been classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The total population (as of 2008) is estimated at 750,000. However, the subspecies O. o. haggardi is listed as Vulnerable because, as of 2008, the total population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals, and is feared to be declining. Hunting is a relatively minor threat, since the oribi shows some tolerance to hunting. Nevertheless, the steep fall of 92% in oribi populations in Como√© National Park (C√¥te d'Ivoire) has been attributed to poaching. Numbers have also declined due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock. The oribi occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range, such as: Gashaka Gumti National Park in Nigeria, the Pendjari and W National Parks (Benin); Aouk Hunting Zone (Chad); Benoue, Bouba Njida and Faro National Parks (Cameroon); Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park (Central African Republic); Garamba, Upemba and Kundelungu National Parks (Congo-Kinshasa); Omo National Park (Ethiopia); Masai Mara Game Reserve and Ruma National Park (Kenya); Golden Gate Highlands National Park (South Africa); Serengeti National Park (Tanzania); Kidepo Valley, Lake Mburo and Murchison Falls National Parks (Uganda); Kafue and Liuwa Plain National Parks and Bangweulu Swamp (Zambia).

The lower right section is an example of ring armour. Ring armour (ring mail) is an assumed type of personal armour constructed as series of metallic rings sewn to a fabric or leather foundation. No actual examples of this type of armour are known from collections or archaeological excavations in Europe. It is sometimes called ringmail or ring mail. In the Victorian era the term \\"mail\\" was used fancifully for any form of metallic body armour. Modern historians reserve the term \\"mail\\" for armour formed of an interlinked mesh of metal rings. The Bayeux Tapestry has been misinterpreted as depicting several different types of armour. It is generally acknowledged today that virtually all the armour on the tapestry is standard mail armour and not \\"ring mail\\", \\"trellised mail\\" or \\"mascled mail\\" or any other Victorian misinterpretation.The Arador Armour Library Theoretical construction Ring armour was believed to be a leather or textile item of clothing (a jacket, or trousers) with a large number of metal rings sewn or tied directly into the foundation garment. Unlike mail armour, the rings are not physically interlocked with each other. Schiessjoppe (eyelet doublet) It has been claimed that the garment called eyelet doublet is not a form of ring armour, but an undergarment intended to be used under actual armour. The eyelets are intended as ventilation holes. It was known as a Schiessjoppe in Germany. However, Sir John Smythe, in 1591, recommended that, \\"Archers should weare either Ilet holed doublets that will resist the thrust of a sword or a dagger and covered with some trim and gallant kinde of coloured cloth to the liking of the captain ... or else Iackes of maile quilted upon fustian.\\" It is clear from this that Smythe's \\"eyelet holed doublet\\" was not intended to be worn with mail but as a standalone armour, but this quote from the book titled \\"The Armourer and His Craft\\" By Charles John Ffoulkes brings into doubt whether the eyelet doublet was related to ring armour at all. In Asia Ring armour seems to have been used in Asia but was rare (see External Image).

His marketing techniques were similar to a travelling salesman's, with roots in the medicine-show tradition. Self-described as \\"America's Fearless Young Showman\\",Eric Schaefer, Bold! Daring! Shocking! True!: A History of Exploitation Films, 1919‚Äì1959 (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1999; ). he is best known for his presentation of the 1945 exploitation film Mom and Dad, which was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2005. Babb was involved in the production and marketing of many films and television shows, promoting each according to his favorite marketing motto: \\"You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em.\\"David F. Friedman, A Youth in Babylon: Confessions of a Trash-Film King (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1990; ). His films ranged from sex education-style dramas to \\"documentaries\\" on foreign cultures, intended to titillate audiences rather than to educate them, maximizing profits via marketing gimmicks. Youth Babb was born in 1906 in Lees Creek, Ohio, USAKenneth Turan, \\"Kroger Babb: Superhuckster\\", Los Angeles Times; reprinted in The Washington Post, November 11, 1977, p. 23. (near Wilmington). He earned the nickname \\"Kroger\\" either from his childhood job at the grocer of the same nameJoe Bob Briggs, Profoundly Disturbing: Shocking Movies That Changed History! (New York: Universe Publishing, 2003; ). or from his father's preference for B.H. Kroger coffee. Babb held a number of jobs during his youth, gaining a mention in Ripley's Believe It Or Not for refereeing a record number of youth sports games. He started out with jobs in sportswriting and reporting at a local newspaper in his 20s, and even showed signs of his later work while showcasing \\"Digger\\" O'Dell, the \\"living corpse\\",Felicia Feaster and Bret Wood, Forbidden Fruit: The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film (Baltimore, Maryland: Midnight Marquee Press, 1999; ). but first achieved success after his promotion to publicity manager for the Chakeres-Warners movie theaters, where he would create different kinds of stunts to lure audiences‚Äîfor example, a drawing to award two bags of groceries to one ticket holder at selected theaters. Another gimmick was to find a furniture store window where a bedroom suite was on display, and there Babb would place a large sign reading \\"Win a bedroom suit (theatre location & date listed)\\". This always ensured a packed house, and the \\"lucky\\" winner was awarded with a pair of pajamas. These experiences led him to the exploitation film business. In the early 1940s Babb joined Cox and Underwood, a company that obtained the rights to poorly made or otherwise unmarketable films of subjects that were potentially controversial or shocking. It would often remove entire sections of these films and add material such as medical reels that lent itself to sensational promotion. Babb went on the road with a Cox and Underwood concoction titled Dust to Dust, a reworking of High School Girl with a childbirth scene added to the end. Its profits allowed Cox and Underwood to retire from the business, leaving Babb to start his own company, Hygienic Productions. He opened it near his childhood home in Wilmington, Ohio, and hired booking agents and advance salesmen along with out-of-work actors and comedians to present repackaged films and new features. Film promotion promotional material Babb is best known for his presentation of exploitation films, a term many in the business would embrace. According to The Hollywood Reporter, his success came from picking topics that would be easily sensationalized, such as religion and sex. His expenses were estimated at 5% for selling, and his distribution overhead near 7%, resulting in some of the largest per-dollar returns in the film industry.Hollywood Reporter, August 20, 1951. Babb's biggest success was Mom and Dad, which he conceived and produced and which William Beaudine directed in six days. Babb headed the promotion of this film following its premiere in early 1945, often going on the road with it himself. The film, a morality tale about a young girl who becomes pregnant and struggles to find someone to turn to, cost $62,000 and over 300 prints were struck and sent to theaters all over the country,National Film Registry 2005 Press Release , Library of Congress (URL accessed August 27, 2006). with a \\"presenter\\"‚Äîlater known as an advance man‚Äîand the presenter would stir up his own controversy in the weeks preceding the film's arrival by writing protest letters to local churches and newspapers and fabricating letters from the mayors of nearby cities relating tales of young women encouraged by the film to discuss similar predicaments. The third highest-grossing film of its decade, Mom and Dad was claimed by Babb to have made $63,000 for every $1,000 the original investors contributed,Kroger Babb obituary, Variety, January 30, 1980. and the Los Angeles Times estimated that it grossed anywhere from $40 million to $100 million. Its success spawned a number of imitations, such as Street Corner and The Story of Bob and Sally, that eventually flooded the market, but it was still being shown around the world decades later* Dennis McDougal, \\"Filmmaker Babb let promotion offset low budgets\\". The Press- Enterprise, (Riverside, CA), unknown date. and ultimately was added to the National Film Registry in 2005. Poster for Babb's production of Mom and Dad, showing some of the rhetorical devices Babb would use to stir up controversy The success of Mom and Dad was mostly due to Babb's marketing strategy of overwhelming a small town with ads and generating controversy. Eric Schaefer explains: :Acknowledging that his films were unknown quantities, Babb advocated a \\"100% saturation campaign\\". In his sample situation--The Deadwood Theater in Movie-hater, Missouri, with a potential audience base of twenty- four thousand--Babb suggested sending tabloid heralds to all seven thousand homes in the area at a cost of $196, spending $65 for newspaper ads, $50 on radio, plus an additional $65 for three hundred window cards, hand-out teaser cards, pennants, and posters. The total came to almost $400, or the same amount the theater owner would normally spend on advertising in the course of an entire month. Babb always claimed that with his formula the profit would outweigh the investment... The film became so ubiquitous that Time said its presentation \\"left only the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life\\". Babb also made sure that each showing of the film followed a similar format: adults-only screenings segregated by gender, and live lectures by \\"Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes\\" during an intermission. At any one time, hundreds of Elliot Forbeses would be giving a lecture at the same time in a variety of locations. (in some predominantly African-American areas, Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens appeared instead, a trend he'd continue with films like \\"She Shoulda Said 'No'!\\"Mike Quarles, Down and Dirty: Hollywood's Exploitation Filmmakers and Their Movies (Jefferson, North Carolina, McFarland, 2001; ). p56.) According to entertainer Card Mondor, an Elliot Forbes in the 1940s who later purchased the Australian and New Zealand rights for Mom and Dad, the Forbeses were \\"mostly local men (from Wilmington, Ohio) who were trained to give the lecture . . . [I]t was a cross-section of the male population, mostly clean-cut young guys . . . The whole concept would have never worked with a trashy look.\\"Card Mondor, letter to Michael Zengel, February 5, 1994 (available from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences archives). During the intermission and after the showing, books relevant to the subject of the film were sold. Mom and Dad's distributor Modern Film Distributors sold over 45,000 copies of Man and Boy and Woman and Girl, written by Babb's wife, netting an estimated $31,000. According to Babb, these cost about eight cents to produce, and were sold for $1 apiece. While Modern Film was able to sell 45,000 on its own, Babb estimates sales of 40 million, citing \\"IRS figures.\\" This sort of companion selling would become common practice for Babb: with the religious film The Lawton Story (AKA-Prince of Peace), he would sell Bibles and other spiritual literature; and with his fidelity film Why Men Leave Home books featuring beauty tips. With other films, Babb would try different approaches. For She Shoulda Said No!, an anti- marijuana film of the 1950s, he highlighted the sexual scenes and arranged \\"one-time-only\\" midnight showings, claiming that his company was working with the United States Treasury Department to release the film \\"in as many towns and cities as possible in the shortest possible length of time\\" as a public service. David F. Friedman, another successful exploitation filmmaker of the era, has attributed the \\"one-time-only\\" distribution to a quality so low that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible. At each showing of a film, a singing of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" was also required.John Windsor, \\"Shot in glorious sexploitation.\\" The Guardian, September 11, 2005. URL accessed January 11, 2006. As well as being at the forefront of the battles over censorship and the motion picture censorship system, the exploitation genre faced numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s. It was estimated that Babb was sued over 400 times just for Mom and Dad (Babb himself claimed 428). He would often use the supposed educational value of the films as a defense, also recommending it to theater owners; in his pressbook for Karamoja, he wrote, \\"When a stupid jerk tries to outsmart proven facts, he should be in an asylum, not a theater.\\" Despite the criticism that Babb drew for Mom and Dad, in 1951 he received the first annual Sid Grauman Showmanship Award, presented by the Hollywood Rotary Club in honor of his accomplishments over the years.\\"Kroger Babb to Get Showmanship Award\\", The Hollywood Reporter, January 31, 1951. Later films Following the success of Mom and Dad, Babb renamed his company Hallmark Productions, continuing the marketing approaches of Hygienic Productions while going beyond health and sex education films. He would later set up a larger distribution company, named Hallmark's Big-6.\\"Babb, 5 Others Form New Indie Distribution Outfit\\", Variety, 23 May issue, year unknown (c. 1960). Babb cheaply acquired the rights to what would become \\"She Shoulda Said No!\\" shortly after Robert Mitchum and Lila Leeds were arrested for marijuana use. Its original producer had struggled to get it distributed as Wild Weed, and Babb quickly presented it as The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Expos√© of the Marijuana Racket, hoping that the title would draw audiences. When it failed to stir up much interest, Babb instead focused on the one scene of female nudity, using a photo of Leeds in a showgirl outfit, and retitled it \\"She Shoulda Said 'No'!\\", with taglines such as \\"How Bad Can a Good Girl Get . . . without losing her virtue or respect???\\" According to Friedman, Babb's midnight presentation of the film twice a week made more money than any other film at the same theater would earn over a full run; Friedman proceeded to use the film in his own roadshow double features. Babb's associates agreed with his belief that \\"Nothing's hopeless if it's advertised right\\", stating that he \\"could take any piece of junk and sell it\\". One film Babb presented in the 1950s was centered on an annual passion play and the story behind putting it on, filmed in 1948 in Lawton, Oklahoma. Initially called The Lawton Story and filmed in Cinecolor, the film was so cheaply, shoddily and quickly made that telephone poles could be seen behind the crucifix. Its cast consisted of local non-professionals whose Oklahoma twangs were so thick that all of their lines had to re-recorded by professional voice-over actors; upon release, one reviewer described it as \\"the only film that had to be dubbed from English to English\\". In addition to re-dubbing it, Babb re-edited and re-titled it The Prince of Peace; it was so successful that the New York Daily News called it \\"the Miracle of Broadway\\". Another film, Karamoja, was marketed as a shocking portrayal of a tribe from Uganda who wore \\"only the wind and live[d] on blood and beer\\". Scenes included \\"the bleeding of cattle and drinking of the warm blood, and self-mutilation as a form of ornamentation\\", as well as a full-color circumcision scene. Karamoja proved less controversial than many of Babb's other films and grossed less. Monika, the Story of a Bad Girl, focusing on sexual aspects to draw audiences Babb never repeated the overwhelming success of Mom and Dad, and he followed much of the exploitation industry in turning to burlesque features in an attempt to make more money. One notorious attempt was his acquisition of the American theatrical rights for Ingmar Bergman's Sommaren med Monika (Summer with Monika). About one-third of the film was cut, and the remaining 62 minutes emphasized nudity by retaining a skinny-dipping scene; the result was titled Monika, the Story of a Bad Girl. Suggestive advertising art, including promotional postcards, portrayed the nude rear of Harriet Andersson. Babb's final film was his presentation of a European version of Harriet Beecher Stowe's book Uncle Tom's Cabin. This was described by Friedman as one of the most \\"unintentionally funny exploitation films ever made\\", filled with \\"second-rate Italian actors who could barely speak English\\".John McCarty, The Sleaze Merchants: Adventures in Exploitation Filmmaking (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995; ). Other ventures After the success of Mom and Dad, Babb talked of an \\"unrealized\\" project called Father Bingo, which he advertised in BoxOffice magazine as \\"An Expos√© of Gambling in the Parish Halls\\"Father Bingo onesheet (Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Library). and described as a comedy with an anti-gambling message about a corrupt priest who runs a \\"controlled\\" bingo night at his parish. Babb called it \\"the best 'snow-job' of my life\\", and it has been speculated that he never intended to make it, despite the trade ads that appeared for years. Babb was involved with many film production companies along with his own, including Southwestern Productions.Virginia Kelley. Leading with My Heart. Simon & Schuster, 1984. On the strength of his past successes, Babb joined John Miller's film production company, Miller-Consolidated Pictures, as vice president and general manager in 1959. Babb advocated the use of the hard- selling technique he had perfected as a presenter: \\"selling the sizzle instead of the steak\\", according to an interview.\\"$1 million Movie I.Q. Contest Tops MCP Exploitation Plan\\", BoxOffice, November 9, 1959, pp. 28‚Äì29, 180. He wrote a column for BoxOffice at the same time. His personal anecdotes provided advice for selling films, such as writing off expenses as tax deductions, and using women's clubs to expand advertising and revenues cheaply. He noted that there were \\"over 30,000 women's clubs\\", and that \\"practically every women's club has a 16mm projector\\". In 1963 Babb formed another distribution company, Studio 10,001. Operating in Beverly Hills (and claiming representation in Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand\\"Kroger Babb Forms New Distributing Co\\", BoxOffice, July 24, 1963.), it used similar roadshow techniques to market television programs such as The Ern Westmore Show.Variety and Daily Variety Television Reviews, vol. 18, 1993‚Äì1994 (New York: Garland, 1996; ). Babb also acted as a showman for hire, promoting others' films when not working on his own. Among them was a nudie-cutie picture titled Kipling's Women, a peep show, and Five Minutes to Love, a reworking of a Rue McClanahan film. Babb began creating promotion kits entitled \\"Who's Got the Ball?\\" in an attempt to teach his craft to would-be presenters. Marketing himself as \\"MR. PIHSNAMWOHS\\" (\\"showmanship\\" backwards), he advertised in BoxOffice. He also dabbled in other areas, writing tirades against pay television and creating a pyramid scheme titled \\"The Idea Factory\\". One of his schemes was the \\"Astounding Swedish Ice Cream Diet\\": overweight throughout his life, Babb claimed to have eaten ice cream three times a day, yet to have lost 100 pounds in 45 days. Personal life Babb met Mildred Horn in 1944 during a showing of Dust to Dust in Indianapolis, where she was working as a movie critic; her review of the film called it a \\"cheap, mislabeled morality play\\", John Waters, \\"My Kind of Guy \\" (URL accessed October 16, 2006). but the two struck up a conversation about it. They stayed together in a common-law marriage; Horn wrote a number of Babb's screenplays, including Mom and Dad, as well as companion books. In November 1953 Babb was arrested on a drunk-driving charge after running a red traffic light and refusing a sobriety test. His $250 bail was continued, and he was not convicted, although this mishap to the recent creator of the anti-alcohol film One Too Many was widely covered in the press.\\"Producer of Film One Too Many Denies Being Tipsy\\", Los Angeles Examiner, November 30, 1953; \\"TV Producer Arrested in Drunk Driving Case\\", Los Angeles Times, November 30, 1953; \\"Producer Arrested on Drunk Charge\\", Citizen News, November 30, 1953. Babb had tax troubles in the years after his success with Mom and Dad. He suggested to the Press-Enterprise that his operation was so diffuse that sales of his one-dollar sex education pamphlets were too difficult to track accurately. Babb eventually sold the rights to Mom and Dad and his stake in Modern Film Distributors to Irwin Joseph and Floyd Lewis‚Äîformer partners in Modern Film who would continue to showcase Mom and Dad across the United States.Mildred A. Babb, letter in Los Angeles Times, May 4, 1986. Babb suffered from various ailments toward the end of his life, including a stroke. He retired in 1977, at 70,\\"Death: Kroger Babb\\", Hollywood Gazette, January 30, 1980. and died of heart failure (due to complications from diabetes) on January 29, 1980, in Palm Springs, California.

All the oropendolas are large birds with pointed bills, and long tails which are always at least partially bright yellow. Males are usually larger than females. The plumage is typically chestnut, dark brown or black, although the Green oropendola and olive oropendola have, as their names imply, an olive coloration to the head, breast and upper back. The legs are dark, but the bill is usually a strikingly contrasting feature, either pale yellow, or red-tipped with a green or black base. In several species there is also a blue or pink bare cheek patch. Oropendolas are birds associated with forests or, for a few species, more open woodland. They are colonial breeders, with several long woven basket nests in a tree, each hanging from the end of a branch. These gregarious birds eat large insects and fruit. They are very vocal, producing a wide range of songs and calls, sometimes including mimicry. Systematics Oropendola nests in Limon, Costa Rica Six of the species in the genus Psarocolius indeed belong there: * Black oropendola, Psarocolius guatimozinus * Chestnut-headed oropendola, Psarocolius wagleri * Russet-backed oropendola, Psarocolius angustifrons * Dusky-green oropendola, Psarocolius atrovirens * Green oropendola, Psarocolius viridis * Crested oropendola, Psarocolius decumanus Four somewhat different species were formerly separated in the genus Gymnostinops. Alternatively, the crested oropendola (and possibly others) would also belong here (Price & Lanyon 2002): * Montezuma oropendola, Psarocolius montezuma * Baudo oropendola, Psarocolius cassini * Olive oropendola, Psarocolius bifasciatus Price & Lanyon (2002) used mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data to research oropendola phylogeny. As is fairly obvious from morphology, the band-tailed oropendola, Ocyalus latirostris and casqued oropendola, Psarocolius oseryi are the most distinct oropendola species. In fact, they appear to be more closely related to the caciques and both species would go into Ocyalus. Alternatively, the casqued oropendola may be separated in Clypicterus, which like Ocyalus would then be a monotypic genus.  References  *ffrench, Richard; O'Neill, John Patton & Eckelberry, Don R.

It features a group of Light Others trying to combat the schemes of Day Watch. The game was released in Russia in 2005 and the United States by CDV on June 29, 2006. A sequel, Day Watch, was released in 2007. The game is powered by the Silent Storm engine. Characters * Stas ‚Äî the main character from the story. He became the Light Other in the beginning of the story. He has a short temper and a gung ho attitude. Has a tendency to make wisecracks in tense situations. If the player chooses the shapeshifter class, Stas shifts into a dog. * Vera ‚Äî a recently recruited member of Night Watch. She was initiated by Geser (the leader of the Night Watch in the novels). Tends to act as a voice of reason of the group. She turns into a panther (if shapeshifter). * Yurik ‚Äî a goodhearted, but somewhat naive member of Night Watch. He was ambushed by Light Others, only to be rescued by Stas. Comes with a 'magical' credit card, which can be used in a near bank, within the same level, for some advanced equipment. If shapeshifter, changes into a wolf. * Anna ‚Äî a recently recruited member of Day Watch. Stas was supposed to kill her as part of his initiation. She does not become a playable character until the middle of the game, when she teams up with Stas to stop Zavulon's scheme. Plot Over the course of the game, it was revealed that both Day Watch and Night Watch found a way to change the potential Others' affiliation via electronic transmitters. Stas was one of its first test subjects, as he was originally supposed to be a Dark Other. Zavulon was planning to take advantage of the spell by converting all the potential Others in Russia into Dark Others.

Playing career Born in Ru≈æomberok, Czechoslovakia (present-day Slovakia), Venglo≈° played as a midfielder for Slovan Bratislava 1954‚Äì1966, and later captained the team, and also played for Czechoslovakia at the B level. After his playing career was prematurely ended by hepatitis, he began his managerial career in Australia, first in club football, before going on to manage the national team. He then returned to Czechoslovakia and coached at club and Under-23 national level. Coaching career In 1973, Venglo≈° was appointed as manager of Slovan Bratislava. During his three years in charge, he twice won the championship. He was also assistant manager of Czechoslovakia from 1973‚Äì1978. As assistant to V√°clav Je≈æek, he helped guide the team to victory in the Euro 1976, beating the Netherlands in the semi-finals and West Germany in the Final. As manager of Czechoslovakia from 1978 to 1982, Venglo≈° led his side to 3rd place in the 1980 European Championship. He also led them to the 1982 World Cup Finals, where they went out in the first round. He then coached Sporting Lisbon from 1983 to 1984, before coaching in Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur FA & Malaysia). In 1988, he was re-appointed to manage Czechoslovakia and took them to the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup. Following the World Cup, he took over at Aston Villa, becoming the first manager born outside Britain or Ireland to take charge of a top division club in England. He left after one season after they finished just two places above the First Division relegation zone. He then moved to the Turkish league, where he managed Fenerbah√ße from 1991 to 1993.

At the end of the season, Venglo≈° left to take up a new position as a European technical adviser and as a scout for Celtic. He is most credited for signing fans' idol ƒΩubom√≠r Moravƒç√≠k during his season as manager. Other successful signings include club legend Johan Mjallby and while a trophy evaded Venglo≈°, he is still looked upon fondly by fans for bringing such players to the club. The stand-out of his reign came as his Celtic side inflicted a punishing 5‚Äì1 defeat on arch-rivals Rangers in the first half of the season. In the new year of 1999, he also took Celtic to Ibrox where they held their Old Firm rivals to a 2‚Äì2 draw on their own soil. He later managed Japanese team JEF United Ichihara for a season in 2002.

To The Surface Transportation Board For the Year Ending December 28, 2007 the successor to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. History By 1886, the Wisconsin Central Railroad had formed a new railway company, called the Chicago and Great Western Railroad (C&GW;) to build a new line from a connection with the WC at Forest Park into the city, and to construct the Grand Central Station, which opened in December 1890. In June 1887, a subsidiary of the Northern Pacific Railroad called the Chicago & Calumet Terminal Railway (C&CT;) consolidated several terminal railroads in the Chicago area with lines running between the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway at McCook, Illinois to the south and south-east to Hammond, Indiana and a connection with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O;). In March 1890, another subsidiary of the Northern Pacific Railroad bought the C&GW; along with several other WC lines in the Chicago area, consolidated them all as the Chicago & Northern Pacific Railroad (C&NP;). The next month, the WC had itself leased to the Northern Pacific. As they were both controlled by the same railroad, the C&NP; and the C&CT; were linked together with new construction and trackage rights. The lease arrangement between the Wisconsin Central and the Northern Pacific worked until the Panic of 1893, when the WC was freed from the lease, and the C&NP; was again placed under the control of the WC. Weakened by the prolonged economic downturn, the C&NP; was bankrupt by October 1893. In July 1897, a new company called the Chicago Terminal Transfer Railroad (CTT) bought the C&NP; from the Wisconsin Central. While the WC (and successor Soo Line Railroad) no longer had its own direct connection to the city, it continued to use the line to access Grand Central Station until 1899, and between 1912 and 1965. In May 1897, the Chicago Terminal Transfer merged the Chicago & Calumet Terminal. The B&O; began using Grand Central Station in 1892, when a connection was made between the CTT and the B&O; at South Chicago. When the Pere Marquette Railroad was completed to Porter, Indiana in 1903, it also used the CTT into Grand Central Station. On January 6, 1910 the Baltimore & Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad was created to purchase the CTT at foreclosure, giving B&O; control of both the terminal railway system, as well as Grand Central Station. The railroad reached a peak size in the 1920s of 78 route-miles and 365 track-miles. Operations The railroad was strategically located in Chicago; connections made at Forest Park and trackage rights allowed the Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie Railway (\\"Soo Line\\") (which had leased the Wisconsin Central in 1909) and the Chicago Great Western Railway access to Grand Central Station. The Pere Marquette Railroad and B&O; (including its grand Capitol Limited) also used the B&OCT; to access Grand Central Station.

Derx in command. Service history During the interwar period, Pruitt operated in the Western Pacific, protecting American interests in the Far East. She was converted to a light minelayer and accordingly redesignated DM-22 on 30 June 1937. LTJG Richard O'Kane, who would be awarded the Medal of Honor as the most successful U.S. submarine officer of World War II, served aboard Pruitt from 1935 through shipyard conversion to a minelayer.O'Kane, Richard H.

At 07:53, Japanese planes flew over the base at low altitude and within minutes some of Pruitts crew had sprinted to other ships and fired their first bullets. Others manned fire hoses and helped distribute ammunition during the attack on Pearl Harbor. At the end of January 1942, Pruitt completed overhaul and took up offshore patrol and minelaying duties with the Hawaiian Sea Frontier. Continuing operations there into June, she sailed, on the 19th, for Bremerton, Washington, from where she steamed to the Aleutian Islands for minelaying operations and escort assignments out of Kodiak. Into the fall she continued operations in the Aleutians, interrupted by regular runs back to the Hawaiian Islands, and then took up escort duties along the west coast. With the new year, 1943, Pruitt shifted south and trained with the 4th Marine Raider Battalion off Southern California. Further escort assignments followed and on 24 April she departed San Francisco, California to return to the Aleutians. Sailing with TF 51, she steamed to Cold Bay, thence to Attu. On 11 May, she arrived off the latter, escorted landing craft into Massacre Bay, and then dispatched the boat waves. After the initial assault she took up anti- submarine and anti-aircraft patrols. Later shifting to Holtz Bay, she continued to perform patrol duties and to escort smaller craft from Amchitka and Adak until the end of the month. Attu in May 1943.

He competed in the AMA Motocross Championships from 1972 to 1973 and in the Motocross World Championships from 1973 to 1976, before returning to compete in the AMA Motocross Championships from 1977 to 1978. Pomeroy is notable for being the first American competitor to win an overall victory in an FIM Motocross World Championship Grand Prix race. Professional racing career Born in Sunnyside, Washington, Pomeroy's family relocated to Yakima, Washington shortly after he was born. His father owned a motorcycle shop that had employed Evel Knievel before he became a famous daredevil stunt rider. Pomeroy began to race professionally in Canada to circumvent the American Motorcyclist Association's 18-year-old age restriction and ended up winning the Western Canadian Championship. He made his AMA debut in 1970 and posted a sixth-place finish in the support race of the 1970 Trans-AMA motocross series round in Washington. In 1972 he competed in the inaugural AMA Motocross National Championship. He won the season opening 250cc race at Saddleback Park in California before, switching to the 500cc class where he finished the 1972 season in fifth place overall. His performance earned him Bultaco factory support through a local Bultaco concession. He was offered the opportunity to compete in a few select world championship Grand Prix events in Europe and he readily accepted. At the end of the 1972 season, Pomeroy along with Brad Lackey, Jimmy Weinert and Gary Jones were selected by the AMA to be the first-ever team to represent the United States at the Motocross des Nations where the team posted a seventh place result. At the time in the early 1970s, European riders still dominated the sport of motocross and Americans weren't considered as talented due to their relative lack of experience. Pomeroy arrived in Europe as an unknown and then proceeded to shock the motorcycle world by riding his privateer Bultaco to an upset victory in the 1973 250cc Spanish motocross Grand Prix. The news of his unexpected victory created a huge wave of excitement in the American motorcycle community where motocross was undergoing an explosive growth in popularity. His victory signaled that American motocross riders were ready to compete with the best in the world. The Bultaco factory quickly hired him to remain in Europe to compete in the 250cc motocross world championship. Pomeroy was once again named to the American team for the 1973 Motocross des Nations event where he helped the team improve to a fourth place result. In the 1974 season, Pomeroy placed 14th overall in the 250cc motocross world championship. Pomeroy along with Brad Lackey, Jimmy Weinert and Tony DiStefano represented the United States at the 1974 Motocross des Nations event where they finished in an impressive second-place, marking the best-ever result at the time for an American team at the event. Pomeroy continued to race for Bultaco in the world championships until 1976 when he posted a career-high finish of fourth place against the best riders in the world. He also posted another impressive result at the 1975 Troph√©e des Nations where he won a race during which he defeated the reigning 500cc world champion, Roger De Coster. Despite his success in the world championships, Pomeroy accepted a contract offer to race for Honda in the AMA national championships in 1977. He began the season by finishing second to Bob Hannah in the 1977 Supercross championship and, followed that with a third-place finish in the 250cc national championship final standings behind Tony DiStefano and Marty Smith. Also in 1977, Pomeroy became the first American competitor to win a moto at the 500cc United States Motocross Grand Prix. Following an injury plagued season in 1978, Pomeroy returned to Europe in 1979 to compete for Bultaco in the world championships. Unfortunately, the Bultaco factory was experiencing financial difficulties and closed a few months later. He then switched to compete for the Beta factory team however, their motorcycle proved to be too fragile and unreliable for the rigors of world championship motocross. Post-racing career By 1980, injuries had begun to take a physical toll on his body and Pomeroy made the decision to retire from competition. He continued his involvement in the sport of motocross by conducting motocross schools and by participating in American Historic Racing Motorcycle Association events involving vintage motorcycles. Pomeroy was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999. On August 6, 2006, Pomeroy was killed when his Jeep rolled in a single-vehicle accident near Yakima, Washington. =Career Highlights= * The first American to win an FIM Motocross World Championship Event (Spain 1973) * The first rider to win his debut World Championship Motocross Grand Prix race (Spain 1973) * The first American to lead the Motocross World Championship (Spain 1973) * The first rider to win a World Championship Motocross Grand Prix on a Spanish motorcycle (Bultaco) * The first winner of an indoor Supercross race (Houston, 1974) * The first American to lead the Trans-AMA Championship (1975) * The first American to win a moto at the 500cc United States Motocross Grand Prix (Carlsbad 1977) * The first non-world champion to win the Troph√©e des Nations event (1975) =Motocross Grand Prix Results= *1973 250cc Motocross World Championship - 7th (Bultaco) *1974 250cc Motocross World Championship - 14th (Bultaco) *1975 250cc Motocross World Championship - 7th (Bultaco) *1976 250cc Motocross World Championship - 4th (Bultaco) *1977 250cc AMA Motocross National Championship - 3rd (Honda) *1978 250cc AMA Motocross National Championship - 5th (Honda)  References External links *Motorcycle Hall of Fame biography Category:1952 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Yakima, Washington Category:American motorcycle racers Category:Motocross riders Category:Road incident deaths in Washington (state) ","title":"Jim Pomeroy (motorcyclist)"},{"id":"2474722","text":"The Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability, in Putney, South West London, is an independent medical charity that provides rehabilitation and long-term care to people with complex neurological disabilities caused by damage to the brain or other parts of the nervous system. This damage is often caused by traffic accidents and progressive neurological conditions such as Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis. The chief executive is Paul Allen. The hospital is a Grade II-listed building.Historic England listing History The Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability (RHN) was established in July 1854 at a meeting held at the Mansion House, chaired by the Lord Mayor of London. The hospital's founder, Andrew Reed, had a record as a practical philanthropist, having previously set up four other charities, and Charles Dickens, the celebrated author, was one of the first high-profile figures to show his support by helping Reed raise funds for it. The RHN was originally known as the Royal Hospital for Incurables. It was based in a converted workhouse in Carshalton, Surrey, but as demand for its services grew, larger premises were required, and in 1857 it moved to a more spacious house in Putney. Just a few years later, even more space was needed and so in 1863 the hospital relocated to its permanent home, Melrose Hall on West Hill, in Putney. Melrose Hall had originally been designed for John Anthony Rucker by the architect Jesse Gibson. It came with 24 acres (97,000 m2) of land on which, until the 1960s, the hospital ran a working farm, supplying fresh produce for patients‚Äô meals. The Hall also had extensive gardens, parts of which had been landscaped by Capability Brown. In 1917, the hospital changed its name to the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables, receiving its Royal Charter two years later. The hospital's name changed a further two times ‚Äì once in 1988, when it became the Royal Hospital and Home, Putney, and again, in 1995, to the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability - a name that better reflected its work. In 1985, the RHN opened the UK's first dedicated Brain Injury Unit, and in 1987, it launched the Vegetative State Unit, the only one of its kind in the UK. The country's first Transitional Rehabilitation Unit - a unit that helps people with acquired brain injuries rehabilitate to the extent that they have regained enough independence to return to life living in the community - was opened at the RHN in 1993. A new ventilator service was unveiled by Ade Adepitan, the former paralympic athlete, in 2013. Named the Jack Emerson Centre, the service helps provide a homely environment for rehabilitation, including specially- adapted environmental controls to increase independence for patients. The service was made possible thanks to a ¬£500,000 donation by The Albert Reckitt Charitable Trust. Supporters and patrons The RHN has always been helped and supported by high-profile figures, including Florence Nightingale; author Charles Dickens; poet, John Betjeman; Thomas Hardy the poet and author; Otto Goldschmidt the pianist. HM Queen Elizabeth II is the hospital's patron. Awards In 2010, the RHN received two 'Innovation Awards' from the UKABIF (United Kingdom Acquired Brain Injury Forum) ‚Äì Innovation by a Clinician and Innovation by a Care Provider. The London Garden Society awarded the RHN a gold medal for its gardens, in 2010 and, on 31 December 2010, an RHN occupational therapist, Helen Gill-Thwaites, received an MBE for her services to healthcare, following the development of an assessment tool at the RHN called SMART (Sensory Modality Assessment & Rehabilitation Technique) which accurately diagnoses disorders of consciousness.

Plot  A plane filled with terrorists attempting to steal money from a treasury plane while airborne is shot down by an FBI plane. The terrorists survive and send out a distress signal, to which the main character, Gabe, responds. However, Gabe does not know that the mayday signal is coming from a group of terrorists, and after reaching them, the terrorists capture Gabe's partner, Hal, and hold him hostage. Gabe must then set out and retrieve the money in order to save Hal.  Gameplay  The game begins with Gabe responding to the call, before Hal being captured. In order to progress through the game, the player must watch out for enemies and either avoid them by jumping or defeat them by attacking with various weapons, such as a knife or a gun. There are also bosses after every few levels, the final boss being Qualen, the leader of the terrorist group. The player can also collect money bags scattered throughout the levels to increase their game score, up to the possible maximum of 958845.This is the score achievable in a single life. Slightly higher score can be gained by losing lives and recollecting weapons on a level because they have a small monetary value, too  Reception  In their review of the Super NES version, Electronic Gaming Monthly deemed the game a poor Double Dragon clone, citing a lack of originality, poor controls, tiresome gameplay, and below average graphics. They were even more condemning of the NES version, saying that the controls suffer from a delay, the soundtrack is grating, and the graphics look like they're from one of the first wave of NES games. Reviewing the Sega CD version, GamePro criticized that the five platforming levels are repetitive to the point of monotony, praised the two snowboarding levels as \\"extremely challenging and fun\\", and complained at the game being weighted more towards the platforming levels than the snowboarding levels. The game was awarded Worst Movie-to-Game of 1994 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. Mega said it was \\"a truly disgusting piece of software\\".  Versions  There are major gameplay differences between the 16-bit and 8-bit versions of the game. The Genesis/Mega Drive, SNES and Sega CD versions are almost identical and feature gameplay similar to street brawlers like Double Dragon and Final Fight. The Sega CD version contains a 3D snowboarding sequence where the player has to escape from an avalanche. Otherwise the gameplay on the 16-Bit systems is the same across the board. The NES, Game Boy and Game Gear versions however contain lower resolution graphics and a simpler side scrolling gameplay.  Legacy  In December 2012 programmer Chris Shrigley, who worked on the Sega Genesis version, released the source code for educational purposes to the public.

The cathedral is a functioning church that receives as many as 3,000 visitors on Sundays, but it has no bishop and therefore no official status as a cathedral in Catholicism.  Geologic  Salt deposits in Zipaquir√° were formed around 250 million years ago, and were raised above sea level during the late Tertiary period, when the Andes were formed.Cardale de Schrimpff, Marianne, Breve informe sobre unas excavaciones arqueol√≥gicas realizadas en las salinas de Zipaquir√°, Cundinamarca, in: Bolet√≠n Museo del Oro , Banco de la Rep√∫blica, Colombia , No. 1, enero-abril de 1978, p. 39-41  Location  The complex is located in Zipaquir√°, in Cundinamarca Department, north of Bogota, at altitude.

Ep√≠grafe, con el respaldo de Colciencias, referenciado por Fundaci√≥n Editorial Ep√≠grafe , Colombia He depicts this deposit as bigger than the main halite mines of the time, such as those in Spain, Switzerland, Poland and the County of Tyrol with a calculated resource estimation of one million cubic meters. Von Humboldt also criticized the excavation techniques as being unpractical for future exploitation, recommending drift mining instead, since the halite tunnels don't require beams, lowering the costs. = Old cathedral = Main altar of the old cathedral, with cross Years before the underground church was built (around 1932), the miners had carved a sanctuary, as a place for their daily prayers asking for protection to the saints before starting to work. In 1950, the construction of a bigger project had begun: the Salt Cathedral which was inaugurated on August 15, 1954, and dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary, Patron saint of miners. It was compound of three naves and a monumental cross. Part of the galleries were actually carved by the ancient Muisca. However, as the church was carved inside an active mine, structural problems and safety concerns led the authorities to shut it in September 1992. This construction cost of the original church was over 285 million U.S. dollars.Informaci√≥n suministrada por la Catedral de Sal, Coordinaci√≥n Comercial, Zipaquir√°, Colombia The building had 120 m length, 5.500 m¬≤ surface and 22 m height. It had six main columns, and a maximum capacity of 8000 people. The main nave included the monumental cross, which was illuminated from the base up, projecting a large cross-shaped shadow in the ceiling. The right nave included the Stations of the Cross icons and the Rosary chapel, with the Virgin of Rosary Icon (sculpted by Daniel Rodriguez Moreno and later transported to the new cathedral). The left nave included the icons of the birth of Jesus and the baptism of Jesus, with a waterfall symbolising the Jordan River. = New cathedral = Main altar in the new cathedral with cross and angel sculpture. The Industrial Investment Institute, together with Salinas Concession and the Colombian Society of Architects opened a contest for the design of the new cathedral, the winner of which was the project presented by Roswell Garavito PearlHistoria del Parque de la Sal, En: Catedral de Sal, Zipaquir√°, Colombia which included structural changes in the access tunnel and the dome. In 1991 the construction of a new cathedral was undertaken, 200 feet under the older one. This new Cathedral was inaugurated on December 16, 1995. Its various corridors and sanctuaries were achieved by making small but significant additions to the caves left behind by previous mining operations. The main sections of the building are: * The Stations of the Cross: At the entrance of the church, there are 14 small chapels, representing the stations of the cross, which illustrate the events of Jesus' last journey. Each station has a cross and several kneeling platforms carved into the halite structure. * The Dome: Located at the end of the main descending entrance ramp. From here, the visitor descends to the bas relief cross chambers, the balcony and the Narthex labyrinth. * The three naves: They are interconnected by a crack, symbolising the birth and death of Christ.

It is also the largest radio station outside of Dublin and Cork broadcasting to a population in excess of 300,000 adults. Media group UTV Media bought the station in a deal worth about ‚Ç¨10 million in 2005. LMFM broadcasts on a number of frequencies, the main being either 95.8FM or 95.5FM. The station is licensed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to service both Counties Louth & Meath. The station also has a strong listenership in counties Dublin, Kildare, Cavan, Monaghan and Armagh in Northern Ireland. Its 95.5 MHz transmitter is notable significantly outside its franchise area, in County Dublin. History LMFM came to be in 1989 with the awarding of a legal licence to cover the Louth/Meath area. This was obtained by Peter Govern with the assistance of the late Tom Savage of Carr Communications. Independent Media Broadcasting won the licence to provide the service. Most of the on-air staff they went on to hire such as Ray Stone, Eddie Caffrey, Daire Nelson & Dermot Finglas were DJs from the pirate days of Radio Carousel, Telstar Radio and Boyneside Radio. In 1997 LMFM attempted to attract a larger volume of listeners in the North Dublin & East Meath area by offering an opt-out station with studios in Clonee, Co. Meath. The new venture was called \\"Fresh 95.5FM\\". LMFM was successful when it reapplied to keep its current licence in 2003 and was again awarded a licence to providing a radio service to the Louth/Meath. LMFM are currently based in purpose studios in Drogheda, Co. Louth. In 2009 it was the centre of controversy when a call-in programme discussed tensions in the Drogheda taxi industry between native Irish and immigrant African drivers. Kevin Faulkner of the Drogheda Taxi Drivers' Association complained about foreign drivers who \\"speak little English, don't know the geography of the area, have lost their photographic ID or claim it has been stolen\\" and that complaints could not be pursued because \\"they all look much the same to the general public.\\" This led to protests outside the station by African drivers.

If this occurs, the operatives would then form the basis of a resistance movement or act as spies from behind enemy lines. Small- scale operations may cover discrete areas, but larger stay-behind operations envisage reacting to the conquest of entire countries.  History  Stay- behind operations of significant size existed during World War II. The United Kingdom put in place the Auxiliary Units. Partisans in Axis-occupied Soviet territory in the early 1940s operated with a stay-behind element. During the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sponsored stay-behind networks in many European countries, intending to activate them in the event of that country being taken over by the Warsaw Pact or if a communist party came to power in a democratic election. According to Martin Packard they were \\"financed, armed, and trained in covert resistance activities, including assassination, political provocation and disinformation.\\" Many hidden weapons caches were found in Italy, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries, at the disposition of these \\"secret armies\\". The most famous of these NATO operations was Operation Gladio, acknowledged by Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti on October 24, 1990.

The word is also used to express an action performed by another and used as an example or model. Exemplary literature This genre sprang from the above, in classical, medieval and Renaissance literature, consisting of lives of famous figures, and using these (by emphasizing good or bad character traits) to make a moral point. Collections of Exempla helped medieval preachers to adorn their sermons, to emphasize moral conclusions or illustrate a point of doctrine. The subject matter could be taken from fables, folktales, legends, real history, or natural history. Jacques de Vitry's book of exempla, c. 1200, Nicholas Bozon's Les contes moralis√©s (after 1320), and Odo of Cheriton's Parabolae (after 1225) were famous medieval collections aimed particularly at preachers. Geoffrey Chaucer's The Miller's Prologue and Tale became a vivid satire on this genre. There were also notable lay writers of moral tales, such as the 13th century Der Stricker and the 14th century Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (Tales of Count Lucanor). Examples dealing with historical figures include: *Suetonius's De vita Caesarum or Lives of the Twelve Caesars *Plutarch's Parallel Lives *Jerome's De viris illustribus *Petrarch's De viris illustribus *Chaucer's The Legend of Good Women *Boccaccio's On Famous Women and On the Fates of Illustrious Men *Christine de Pizan's The Book of the City of Ladies. *Mirror for Magistrates by various Tudor authors Three examples of exempla The Norton Anthology of Western Literature includes three exempla (singular, exemplum), stories that illustrate a general principle or underscore a moral lesson: \\"The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man\\" and \\"The King's Tailor's Apprentice\\" (both from The Scholar's Guide) and \\"The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck.\\" =\\"The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man\\"= In \\"The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man,\\" told by the father, the three traveling companions of the tale's title are on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Near their destination, their provisions are nearly depleted, and the two city dwellers attempt to cheat the country man by telling him that whoever of them dreams the most extraordinary dream shall get the last of their bread. As the city dwellers sleep, the country man, alert to their intended deception, eats the half-baked bread before retiring. The city dwellers relate their made-up dreams. One says he was taken to heaven and led before God by angels. The other says that angels escorted him to hell. The country man says he dreamed the same things that his companions dreamed and, believing them to be forever lost, one to heaven and the other to hell, ate the bread. The son tells his father the moral of the story: \\"As it says in the proverb, ‚ÄòHe who wanted all, lost all.‚Äô\\" He says that the two city dwellers got their just comeuppance. The story says that he wishes they‚Äôd been whipped, as the antagonist in another story he has heard, was beaten for his chicanery. His comment is a transition to the next tale, causing the father to ask his son to tell him this story. Thus, the roles of the father and his son are reversed, as the father, who was the storyteller, becomes the listener, and the son, who was his father's audience, becomes the narrator. =\\"The King And His Wife\\"= The son's story recounts the story of a king's tailor's assistant, a youth by the name of Nedui. One day while he is away, his master gives the other apprentices bread and honey, but does not save any for Nedui, telling them that Nedui \\"would not eat honey even if he were here.\\" Upon learning that he has been left out, Nedui avenges himself upon his master by telling the eunuch whom the king has set over the apprentices as their supervisor that the tailor is subject to seizures of madness, during which he becomes violent and dangerous. In fact, Nedui claims, he has killed those who have happened to be near him when he is in the grip of such a fit. To protect himself, Nedui says, he binds and beats the tailor when such a fit comes over him. He also tells the eunuch what to look for: \\"When you see him looking all around and feeling the floor with his hands and getting up from his seat and picking up the chair on which he is seated, then you will know that he is mad, and if you do not protect yourself and your servants, he will beat you on the head with a club.\\" The next day, Nedui hides the tailor's shears, and, when the master, hunting for them, behaves as Nedui mentioned to the eunuch, the eunuch orders his servants to bind the tailor and beats him himself with a club. His servants also beat him until he is unconscious and \\"half dead.\\" When he regains consciousness, the tailor asks the eunuch what crime he has committed to have deserved such a beating, and the eunuch tells him what Nedui told him about the tailor's seizures. \\"Friend, when have you ever seen me crazy?\\" the master asks his apprentice, to which question he receives, from Nedui, the rejoinder: \\"When have you ever seen me refuse to eat honey?\\" The father tells the son the moral of the story: \\"The tailor deserved his punishment because if he had kept the precept of Moses, to love his brother as himself, this would not have happened to him.\\" By having the listener tell the narrator the moral of the story, the storyteller shows that the narrative has successfully served its purpose as an exemplum, as the listener, hearing the story, shows that he is able to ascertain the moral that the tale is intended to express. =\\"The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck\\"= The third exemplum, \\"The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck,\\" is a prose, rather than a poetic, narrative. Like a mini-sermon, it preaches against wrong conduct‚Äîin this case, sacrilegious behavior. This tale has an identifiable author, Robert Mannyng, who set down the story in the early fourteenth century. The Norton Anthology's version is translated by Lee Patterson from the Middle English Handlyng Synne. A prose version of it appears in the early 12th century Gesta Regum Anglorum by William of Malmesbury, which in turn was probably taken from the Translatio Sanctae Edithae by Goscelin under the literary influence of the nunnery at Wilton Abbey.‚ÄúEdith Becomes Matilda.‚Äù England in Europe: English Royal Women and Literary Patronage, C.1000‚ÄìC.1150, by ELIZABETH M. TYLER, University of Toronto Press, Toronto; Buffalo; London, 2017, pp. 302‚Äì353, 342. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt1whm96v.14. Accessed 4 May 2020. To bolster his listener's belief that \\"most of\\" his tale is \\"the gospel truth,\\" the narrator names the culprits and their victims and cites Pope Leo as one who knows (and wrote a version of) the narrative and points out that the story is \\"known in the court at Rome\\" and has appeared widely in many chronicles, including those \\"beyond the sea.\\" However, after the telling of the tale, the storyteller admits that some doubt its veracity. The story starts by identifying several activities that are not allowed in church or in the churchyard: \\"carols, wrestling, or summer games.\\" In addition, \\"interludes or singing, beating the tabor [a small drum], or piping. . . . while the priest is conducting mass\\" are \\"forbidden\\" and sacrilegious, and \\"good priests\\" will not tolerate them. It is also improper to dance in church, as the story that the narrator is about to tell demonstrates. When \\"twelve fools\\" in Colbeck (or, as the editors‚Äô note explains, \\"Kolbigk, in Saxony, an area in eastern Germany, just north of the present-day Czech border) decided, one Christmas Eve, to make \\"a carol--madly, as a kind of challenge,\\" and persisted in singing and dancing in the churchyard while the priest was trying to conduct Mass, despite his entreaties to them to stop, the priest calls upon God to curse them. The singers‚Äô carol contains three lines, the last of which appears to become the basis of their curse, as they are unable to leave the churchyard or to quit singing or dancing for a year after God curses them for their sacrilegious behavior: :By the leafy wood rode Bovoline, :With him he led the fair Mersewine. :Why are we waiting? Why don‚Äôt we go? As a result of the curse, the dancers cannot stop singing and dancing; neither can they let go of one another's hands. The priest, too late, sends his son, Ayone, to rescue his daughter, Ave, who is one of the \\"twelve fools\\" involved in the dancing. However, due to the curse, when Ayone takes his sister's arm to separate her from the other carolers, it detaches from her body. Miraculously, her wound does not bleed, nor does she die from it. Ayone takes the arm to his father. The priest tries, three times unsuccessfully, to bury the limb, but the grave casts it back, so the priest displays it inside the church. Everyone, including the emperor, comes to see the cursed dancers, who, despite no rest, food, drink, or sleep, dance non-stop, night and day, regardless of the temperature or the weather. Several times, the emperor orders a covering to be built to protect the dancers from storms, but it is reduced to rubble overnight each time it is built or rebuilt. After the year has ended, the curse is lifted, and the dancers fall down upon the ground, as if dead. Three days later, they arise‚Äîexcept for Ave, who has died. Soon after, the priest also dies. The emperor installs the container in the church as a receptacle for the dead girl's arm, and it becomes a holy relic commemorating the miracle of the curse. The other dancers cannot get together again, ever, and must skip, instead of walking, wherever they go. Living mementoes of God's curse against sacrilegious behavior, they bear permanent physical changes to their clothing and their bodies: \\"Their clothes didn‚Äôt rot nor their nails grow; their hair didn‚Äôt lengthen nor their complexion change. Nor did they ever have relief...\\" Although some believe and others doubt the authenticity of the tale he's told, the narrator says he recounted the story so that his listeners, taking heed, may be \\"afraid to carol in a church or churchyard, especially against the priest's will,\\" as \\"jangling is a form of sacrilege.\\" Bibliography *The Norton Anthology of Western Literature, Volume I.

His catchy rhythms, inventive rhymes and absurd characters have invited comparisons with the American children's author Dr. Seuss. Chukovsky's poems Tarakanishche (\\"The Monster Cockroach\\"), Krokodil (\\"The Crocodile\\"), Telefon (\\"The Telephone\\") and Moydodyr (\\"Wash-'em-Clean\\") have been favourites with many generations of Russophone children. Lines from his poems, in particular Telefon, have become universal catch-phrases in the Russian media and everyday conversation. He adapted the Doctor Dolittle stories into a book-length Russian poem as Doctor Aybolit (\\"Dr. Ow-It-Hurts\\"), and translated a substantial portion of the Mother Goose canon into Russian as Angliyskiye Narodnyye Pesenki (\\"English Folk Rhymes\\"). He was also an influential literary critic and essayist. Early life He was born Nikolay Vasilyevich Korneychukov (), which he reworked into his now familiar pen-name while working as a journalist at Odessa News in 1901. He was born in St. Petersburg, the illegitimate son of Ekaterina Osipovna Korneychukova (a peasant girl from the Poltava region of Ukraine) and Emmanuil Solomonovich Levenson, a man from a wealthy Jewish family (his legitimate grandson was mathematician Vladimir Rokhlin). Levenson's family did not permit his marriage to Korneychukova and the couple eventually was forced to separate. Korneychukova moved to Odessa with her two children, Nikolay and his sister Marussia.http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/27518201.html Levenson supported them financially for some time, until his marriage to another woman. Nikolay studied at the Odessa gymnasium, where one of his classmates was Vladimir Zeev Jabotinsky. Later, Nikolay was expelled from the gymnasium for his \\"low origin\\" (a euphemism for illegitimacy). He had to get his secondary school and university diplomas by correspondence. He taught himself English and, in 1903‚Äì05, he served as the London correspondent at an Odessa newspaper, although he spent most of his time at the British Library instead of the press gallery in the Parliament. Back in Russia, Chukovsky started translating English works, notably Walt Whitman, and published several analyses of contemporary European authors, which brought him in touch with leading personalities of Russian literature and secured the friendship of Alexander Blok. Chukovsky's English was not idiomatic as he had taught himself to speak it by reading and he thus pronounced English words in a distinctly odd manner, and it was difficult for people to understand him in England. His influence on Russian literary society of the 1890s is immortalized by satirical verses of Sasha Cherny, including Korney Belinsky (an allusion to the famous critic Vissarion Belinsky). Later he published several notable literary titles including From Chekhov to Our Days (1908), Critique stories (1911) and Faces and masks (1914). He also published a satirical magazine called Signal (1905‚Äì1906) and was arrested for \\"insulting the ruling house,\\" but was acquitted after six months of investigative incarceration. Later life and works Mayakovsky's caricature of Korney Chukovsky It was at that period that Chukovsky produced his first fantasies for children. The girl from his famous novel 'The Crocodile' was inspired by Lyalya, daughter of his long-time friend, publisher Zinovii Grzhebin. As the 2004 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica put it, \\"clockwork rhythms and air of mischief and lightness in effect dispelled the plodding stodginess that had characterized pre-revolutionary children's poetry.\\" Subsequently, they were adapted for theatre and animated films, with Chukovsky as one of the collaborators. Sergei Prokofiev and other composers even adapted some of his poems for opera and ballet. His works were popular with emigre children as well, as Vladimir Nabokov's complimentary letter to Chukovsky attests. During the Soviet period, Chukovsky edited the complete works of Nikolay Nekrasov and published From Two to Five (1933), a popular guidebook to the language of children. As his invaluable diaries attest, Chukovsky used his popularity to help the authors persecuted by the regime including Anna Akhmatova, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Alexander Galich and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. He was the only Soviet writer who officially congratulated Boris Pasternak on winning the Nobel Prize. His daughter, Lydia Chukovskaya, is remembered as a noted writer, memoirist, philologist and lifelong assistant and secretary of the poet Anna Akhmatova. Chukovsky's son Nikolai was a military writer, his son Boris lost his life while serving in the army during World War II, and his daughter Maria died in her childhood from tuberculosis. Soviet stamp commemorating Korney Chukovsky At one point his writings for children were under severe criticism. Nadezhda Krupskaya was an initiator of this campaign, but criticism also came also from children's writer Agniya Barto. Starting in the 1930s, Chukovsky lived in the writers' village of Peredelkino near Moscow, where he is now buried. For his works on the life of Nekrasov he was awarded a Doctor of Science degree in philology. He also received the Lenin Prize in 1962 for his book, Mastery of Nekrasov and an honorary doctorate from Oxford University in 1962.

His two biggest hit singles, both written with John F Young and performed by him (Boyd) were \\"Seventeen\\" with his band, the Rockets (U.S. No. 5), (U.S. R&B; No. 7), as well as No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart.; and \\"My Boy, Flat Top\\" (U.S. No. 39).Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. 7th edn, 2000 He later became a disc jockey in Kentucky. He also worked with Francis Craig and Moon Mullican. Bennett was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame for his contribution to the genre. Life and career Bennett was born in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, United States, but attended high school in Tennessee and formed his first band there. He grew up in North Davidson, Tennessee, just outside Nashville. His family was musically oriented and talented. His grandfather taught members of churches within the community how to read music. He also taught Boyd by the age of four years how to read the notes in music, before Boyd could actually read song lyrics. Growing up during the Great Depression, Bennett did anything he could to make money. He sang in quartets and played guitar and sang outside of bars for extra funds. At the age of 16, however, his career was interrupted by World War II in which he served for four years; and in his free time perfected his playing of the guitar. During the early 1950s, Boyd Bennett and his Southlanders performed at local dances and on variety TV shows. In 1952, while working at WAVE (TV), Boyd came up with the idea of a musical variety show called Boyd Bennett and His Space Buddies. For Foster Brooks, this was his first break in show business. The show was a take-off of the Gene Autry Show. Instead of singing cowboys, it was singing space cadets. The humor, music, and originality made the show a hit with local fans. The owner of the station was not so farsighted and the show was canceled after seven episodes. The next couple of years they performed at numerous dances and shows in the Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio area. Boyd and his group played in the Rustic Ballroom in Jasper, Indiana on a regular basis for a number of years. Renamed as Boyd Bennett and His Rockets, they came to the attention of Syd Nathan, owner of King Records. They released a couple of country tracks, \\"Time\\" and \\"Hopeless Case\\". Nathan then signed Bennett to a recording contract. Bennett's Rockets became King's house band, backing up Moon Mullican, Earl Bostic, Bill Doggett, Merle Travis, and Otis Williams and the Charms. Bennett's live appearances made him conscious of the teenage audience, and he began to emphasize songs that would appeal to teenagers. The band played for both musical and comic effect, with 425-pound trumpeter Jim Muzey (billed as \\"Big Moe\\"), 110-pound guitarist M. D. Allen, bassist Kenny Cobb, and saxophonist Boots Randolph. Vocals rotated between Bennett, Muzey and, later, Elvis Presley-influenced Cecil McNabb, Jr. Bennett experimented with rhythm-heavy arrangements, and rented the King Records studio to record \\"Poison Ivy\\" (not the similarly titled hit recorded by The Coasters), \\"You Upset Me Baby\\", and \\"Boogie at Midnight\\". When sales topped 100,000 copies, the singles were then re-released under King Records. In 1955, Boyd Bennett and His Rockets recorded \\"Seventeen\\". Bennett aimed the song directly at the teenage audience, but producer Syd Nathan dismissed the effort and claimed that teenagers had no money to buy records. Bennett shrewdly waited until Nathan left for a two-week vacation, and prevailed upon Nathan's assistant Henry Glover to release the record.Robert Reynolds, Hepcats & Rockabilly Boys, 2018, . It reached the Billboard chart on July 9, 1955, and went to the number five by September. Boyd and the Rockets traveled across the nation. There were also several cover versions recorded that extended the release of the song. These included fellow chart efforts by The Fontane Sisters, Rusty Draper, and Ella Mae Morse. The Boyd Bennett disc of \\"Seventeen\\" \\"changed record-producing/buying and marketing forever,\\" wrote musicologist Robert Reynolds: \\"As Boyd Bennett had predicted, teenagers bought 'Seventeen' in droves and other record companies soon began producing songs aimed specifically at the teen market. The record hung around the Top Ten for five weeks. When all was said and done, [Bennett's] 'Seventeen' had sold three million copies.\\"Robert Reynolds, Hepcats & Rockabilly Boys, 2018, . Boyd Bennett and his band followed \\"Seventeen\\" with \\"My Boy Flat Top\\" (almost identical, melodically) which reached the Top 40 for a number of months, although a lesser seller than their earlier effort. Boyd also worked as a disc jockey in 1955 in Louisville, Kentucky. In March 1956, Boyd's group released their cover version of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\". In 1959, Bennett left King Records and commenced a subsequent brief recording career with Mercury. Noting that he was drifting away from a teenage audience, he left the music industry and built up his business interests, which included owning nightclubs and an air-conditioning parts manufacturer. In the 1970s and 1980s, Bennett had health issues with both lymphoma and pulmonary fibrosis. He retired in Dallas, although he made infrequent concert appearances, often with Ray Price. He also recorded for Dallas-based Christian record label Rainbow, including the 1980s album \\"Step Into The Sunshine\\". Bennett died of a lung ailment in Sarasota, Florida on June 2, 2002. Shortly before his death he was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

The history of Toronto begins approximately 12,500 years ago at the end of the Ice Age with the withdrawal of the ice sheet from the area of present-day Toronto. Soon afterward small groups of Indigenous people moved into the area. Prior to 1000 AD, the Wyandot people were likely the first group to live in the area, followed by the Iroquois. When Europeans first came to Toronto, they found a small Iroquois village known as Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. The Mississaugas, a branch of the Ojibwa, moved into the area, drove out the Iroquois and settled along the north shore of the lake. The French first set up trading posts in the area, including Fort Rouill√© in 1720, which they abandoned as the British conquered French North America in the Seven Year's War. After the US War of Independence, the lands of the Toronto area were purchased from the Mississaugas to provide land for a new settlement. In 1793, Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe moved the capital of Upper Canada to Toronto, which he named York, not wanting an aboriginal name. Simcoe originally planned for York to be a city and military outpost and to set up a capital in the area of London, Ontario, but he abandoned the plan and York was named the permanent capital in 1796. The Mississaugas set up a settlement in the area of Port Credit to the west of York and eventually moved further west. Simcoe directed York's initial settlement on a gridiron layout near the mouth of the Don River. In 1797, the garrison which became Fort York was built at the entrance to Toronto Harbour. War between the British and Americans broke out in 1812, including a battle at the garrison in 1813. Peace came after only two years of the war which ended in a stalemate. During peacetime, York steadily grew in population, although its infrastructure lagged, leading to the nickname of \\"Muddy York\\". As the village grew, tensions grew between the ruling class in York and growing merchant and worker classes who advocated for reforms. York was incorporated and renamed Toronto in 1834, leading to the first Toronto elections. Toronto's first mayor William Lyon Mackenzie, a reformer, persisted in his efforts to reform Upper Canada, culminating in his organization of a rebellion in 1837. Upper Canada forces defeated the rebels, and Mackenzie and others fled to the United States. The city steadily grew during the 19th century, a major port of distribution as Upper Canada was settled. Toronto businesses grew including the meat packing business, leading to the nickname of \\"Hogtown\\". Toronto continued to grow by annexing outlying villages up until the early 1900s. After World War II, another major influx of immigrants came to the region, leading to a demand for new development in the outskirts of Toronto. To support the suburban growth, the Government of Ontario set up Metropolitan Toronto, a regional government encompassing Toronto and its suburbs, in 1954. The regional government, along with Ontario, invested heavily in infrastructure facilitating a boom in population and industry. In the second half of the 20th century, Toronto surpassed Montreal as Canada's largest city and became the economic capital of the country. In 1998, the \\"megacity\\" of Toronto was formed by the dissolution of the regional government and the amalgamation of the Toronto municipalities into one municipality. In the 21st Century, the central core has seen unprecedented office growth and residential growth, particularly of condominium apartments, while the former suburbs and further outlying suburbs have seen the bulk of new industrial investment. A major metropolis of just over 2.8 million people, Toronto is also one of the most ethnically diverse in the world. All of this growth took place on the lands of the original Toronto Purchase, of which final agreement was only finally reached between the Mississaugas and the Government of Canada in 2010. Etymology Toronto was originally used on maps dating to the late 17th and early 18th century to refer to Lake Simcoe and the portage route to it. Eventually, the name was brought down to the mouth of the Humber River, which is where the present City of Toronto is situated. The bay serves as the end of the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail portage route from Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay. The word is likely derived from the Mohawk word tkaronto meaning \\"where there are trees standing in the water\\", which originally referred to The Narrows, near present-day Orillia. Hurons and many other groups that had lived there drove stakes into the water to create fishing weirs. French maps from the 1680s to 1760s identify present-day Lake Simcoe as Lac de Taronto. The spelling changed to Toronto during the 18th century. As the portage route grew in use, the name became more widely used and was eventually attached to a French trading fort just inland from Lake Ontario on the Humber. Confusion about the name of location may also be attributed to the succession of First Nations peoples who lived in the area, including the Neutral, Seneca, Mohawk, Cayuga and Wendat nations.See R. F. Williamson, ed., Toronto: An Illustrated History of its First 12,000 Years (Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008), ch. 2, with reference to the Mantle Site It has also been speculated that the name origin is the Seneca word Giyando, meaning \\"on the other side\\", which was the place where the Humber River narrows at the foot of the pass to the village of Teiaiagon. From August 1793 to March 1834, the settlement was known as York, sharing the same name as the county it was situated in. The settlement was renamed when Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe called for the town to be named after the Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. To differentiate from York in England and New York City, the town was known as \\"Little York\\". In 1804, settler Angus MacDonald petitioned the Parliament of Upper Canada to restore the original name of the area, but this was rejected. The town changed its name back to Toronto when it was incorporated into a city. Early historyAncient Toronto= Development of the Great Lakes following the end of the Last Glacial Period. The first human settlers arrived in the area 11,000 to 10,500 years ago, as the glaciers retreated from the area. Toronto remained under glacial ice throughout the Last Glacial Period, with the glacial ice retreating from the area during the Late Glacial warming period approximately 13,000 BCE. Following the Last Glacial Period, Toronto's waterfront shifted with the growth, and later contraction of glacial Lake Iroquois. The area saw its first human settlers around 9000 BCE to 8,500 BCE. These settlers traversed large distances in family-sized bands, sustaining themselves on caribou, mammoths, mastodons, and smaller animals in the tundra and Boreal forest. Many of their archaeological remains lie in present-day Lake Ontario, with the historic coastline of Lake Iroquois situated south of Toronto during this period. As the climate warmed in 6,000 BCE, the environment of Toronto shifted to a temperate climate. The Toronto waterfront also changed dramatically during this period, with erosion from the Scarborough Bluffs accumulating, and rising water levels from Lake Ontario creating a peninsula that would later become the Toronto Islands. =First Nations settlements= First Nations fishing camps were established around the waterways of Toronto as early as 1,000 BCE. By 500 CE, up to 500 people lived along each of the three major rivers of Toronto (Don, Humber, and Rouge River). Early on, First Nations communities had developed trails and water routes in the Toronto area. These led from northern and western Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. One trail, known as the \\"Toronto Passage\\", followed the Humber River northward as an important overland shortcut between Lake Ontario and the upper Great Lakes. Ganatsekwyagon and other areas highlighted along the Rouge Trail, c. 1673. Teiaiagon is shown west Ganatsekwyagon. New crops, including corn, sunflowers, and tobacco, were introduced into the area from the south around 600 CE. The introduction of these crops saw large societal shifts in the area; including a change in diet, and the formation of semi-permanent villages, in order to farm these crops. Inhabitants of these semi-permanent villages moved out during parts of the year to hunt, fish, and gather other goods to supplement their farming. The earliest Iroquoian settlement in Toronto occurred around 900 CE. Iroquoian villages during this period were located on high, fortified grounds, with access to wetlands and waterways to facilitate hunting, fishing, trade, and military operations. Iroquoian villages typically lasted a period of 10 to 20 years, before its inhabitants relocated to a new site. Several Huron villages dating back to the 1200s have been excavated in Toronto, including a Huron ossuary in Scarborough. From the 1300s to the 1500s, the Iroquoian inhabitants of the area migrated north of Toronto, joining the developing Huron confederacy. During this period, the Huron confederacy used Toronto as a hinterland for hunting, with the Toronto Passage continuing to see use as a north‚Äìsouth route. The northeast portion of Toronto also held two 14th century Huron burial mounds, known today as Taber Hill. Although Europeans did not visit Southern Ontario in the 16th century, European goods had begun to make its way into the region as early as the late-1500s. During the 17th century, nearly half of Southern Ontario's First Nations population was wiped out from as a result of the transmission of communicable diseases between Europeans and First Nations groups. The population loss, along with the desire to secure furs for trade, saw the Iroquois Confederacy to the south, defeat the Huron inhabitants of the area. Although some Huron refugees fled the area, the majority were absorbed and eventually integrated into the Iroquois. After the Iroquois secured the Toronto area, several Iroquois settlement of the north shore of Lake Ontario were established. The Seneca (one of the five Iroquois nations), established two settlements in present-day Toronto, Teiaiagon, near the Humber River, and Ganatsekwyagon near the Rouge River. The two communities provided the Iroquois control of the north‚Äìsouth passage in Toronto. Roman Catholic missionaries visited the two settlements in the 1660s and 1670s. However, by 1687, the two settlements were abandoned by the Seneca. Humber and Rouge River providing a shortcut to the upper Great Lakes. These routes were known as the Toronto Passage. The Mississaugas arrived in the late 17th century, driving out the occupying Iroquois,The Ojibwa-Iroquois War: The War the Five Nations Did Not Win. Leroy V. Eid. Ethnohistory, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Autumn, 1979), Duke University Press, pp. 297-324Schmalz, Peter S., The Ojibwa of Southern Ontario. University of Toronto Press. . pp 21-22 and settling along the Lake Ontario shore, including the Port Credit area. =Early European settlement= It is believed that the first European to set foot on the shores of Lake Ontario in the vicinity of what is now Toronto was French explorer √âtienne Br√ªl√©, taking the Toronto Passage from Huronia in 1615; although the claim is disputed by a number of scholars, who suggest that Br√ªl√© took a more westerly route and reached Lake Erie, as opposed to Lake Ontario. However, Europeans were active in the Toronto area by the 1660s, with missionaries visiting First Nations settlements in the area. By the 18th century, Toronto became an important location for French fur traders, given its proximity to the Toronto Passage. In 1720, Captain Alexandre Dagneau established Fort Douville on the Humber River, near the shore of Lake Ontario. The trading post was built in an effort to divert First Nations traders from British trading posts to the south of Toronto. The success of Fort Douville prompted the British to build a larger trading post in Oswego, New York. The completion of Fort Oswego in 1726 led the French to abandon their first trading post in Toronto. Fort Rouill√© was one of several French trading posts established in Toronto during the 1750s. The forts were abandoned in 1759 as a result of the Seven Years' War. The French established another trading post in 1750 on the Humber River. It was successful enough to encourage the French to establish Fort Rouill√©, at present day Exhibition Place in 1751. After the British captured Fort Niagara in July 1759, Fort Rouill√© was destroyed by its French occupants, who withdrew to Montreal. In 1760, Robert Rogers, with an armed force of two hundred men and a flotilla of fifteen whaleboats came to secure the Toronto area. The Treaty of Paris of 1763 formally ended the Seven Years' War and saw New France ceded to the British. The area presently comprising Toronto was also ceded to the British, with the area forming a part of the Pays d'en Haut region of New France. European settlement in central Canada was quite limited before 1775, amounting to only a few families in the area. However, in the aftermath of the American Revolutionary War, the area saw an influx of settlers, known as the United Empire Loyalists; American colonists who either refused to accept being divorced from the Crown, or who felt unwelcome in the new republic of the United States. A number of loyalists fled from the United States to the mostly unsettled lands north of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario; some had fought in the British Army and were paid with land in the region. These early immigrants originated from the midland region of the United States. They valued pluralism, were organized around the middle class, were suspicious of top-down government interventions, and were politically moderate. It has been argued that these immigrants' attitudes laid the foundation for Southern Ontario's (and by extension Toronto's) existing pluralistic and politically moderate culture. In 1786, Lord Dorchester arrived in Quebec City as Governor-in-Chief of British North America. His mission was to solve the problems of the newly landed Loyalists from the United States after the US War of Independence. At first, Dorchester suggested opening the new Canada West as districts under the Quebec government, but the British Government made known its intention to split the Province of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada. Dorchester began organizing for the new province of Upper Canada, including a capital. Dorchester's first choice was Kingston, but was aware of the number of Loyalists in the Bay of Quinte and Niagara areas, and chose instead the location north of the Bay of Toronto, midway between the settlements and from the US. Under the Imperial policy of the time, namely the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which was rooted in Roman Law, Dorchester arranged to purchase more than of land from the Mississaugas in 1787. After surveying the land, the Mississaugas objected to the purchase and it was declared invalid. Another agreement would be made in 1805, but this agreement too fell into dispute and was only eventually settled two centuries later in 2010 for . A townsite was surveyed in 1788 by Captain Gother Mann, and laid out in a gridiron, with government and military buildings around a central square. The purchase did not include the Rouge River valley, yet to be settled. The influx of loyalist settlers to the western portions of the Province of Quebec, including the Toronto area, led to the passage of the Constitutional Act 1791. The Act split the colony into two; with the eastern portion of Quebec forming the Province of Lower Canada, and the western portion of Quebec (including Toronto) forming the Province of Upper Canada. A provisional Upper Canada government was set up in Newark (today's Niagara-on-the-Lake) in 1791. Town of York (1793‚Äì1834) Constructed in 1793, Fort York was located at the entrance of a bay formed by the Toronto Islands. In May 1793, Lieutenant-Colonel John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant-governor of the newly organized province of Upper Canada, visited Toronto for the first time. Simcoe was unhappy with the then-capital of Upper Canada Newark, and proposed moving it to the site of present-day London, Ontario but was dissuaded by the difficulty of building a road to the location. Rejecting Kingston, the choice of British Governor Lord Dorchester, the Toronto purchase site was then chosen by Simcoe on July 29, 1793, as the temporary capital of Upper Canada. Simcoe and his wife set up in a large tent at the water's edge near the foot of today's Bathurst Street. Toronto would remain \\"temporary\\" in status until 1796. The town, which Simcoe named \\"York\\", rejecting the aboriginal name, was built within a large protected bay formed by the Toronto Islands, which ‚Äì at the time ‚Äì was a long sandy peninsula, which formed a large natural harbour, featuring a great wetland marsh ‚Äì fed by the Don River ‚Äì at the eastern end (long since filled in), with the only opening to the lake at the western end (it was only later, in 1858, that the \\"Eastern Gap\\", was punched through the peninsula by a storm, creating the true Island). This large natural harbour was defended with the construction of a garrison (later to be known as Fort York), guarding the entrance on what was then a high point on the water's edge, with a small river on the inland side (Garrison Creek). Rejecting Mann's town plan, Simcoe had another town plan set up. This was a more compact plan, a gridiron settlement of ten square blocks, closer to the eastern end of the harbour, entirely behind the peninsula, near what is now Parliament Street. The ten blocks are known today as the \\"Old Town\\" neighbourhood. King Street in 1804. Later renamed Front Street, the road was one of York's original streets. During Simcoe's time in Toronto, two main roads were laid out in the city: Dundas Street, named after Sir Henry Dundas and Yonge Street, named after Sir George Yonge, the British Secretary of State for War. The Queen's Rangers and conscripted German settlers hacked out the wagon path of Yonge Street as far north as the Holland River. Government buildings were erected near Parliament and Front Street. Simcoe had hoped to found a university in York during his time but was successful in establishing law courts in York. Labour was in short supply, and slaves were still allowed at this time, but Simcoe arranged for the gradual abolition of slavery, passing legislation banning any further slaves, and the children of slaves would be freed when they reached their 25th birthday. Due to ill health, Simcoe returned to England in July 1796 on leave but did not return and he gave up his position in 1799. By this time, York was estimated to have a population of 240 persons. Peter Russell was named administrator by Simcoe. Between 1799 and 1800, a road was constructed east of Toronto to the mouth of the Trent River by Asa Danforth. This was the making of today's Kingston Road. Russell established the first jail. He expanded the town westward and northward and during his term, the first St. Lawrence Market was built in 1803. The first church of what was to become today's St. James Cathedral was built in 1807. When Russell died in 1808, the town's population was now up to 500. =War of 1812= The American naval squadron exchange fire with Fort York during the Battle of York in April 1813. The American landing is depicted to the west (bottom left of image). On 27 April 1813, American forces led by Zebulon Pike attacked York. After the British-Native force failed to prevent the American landings (in present-day Parkdale), British forces ordered a withdrawal, realizing that defence was impossible. Upon their departure, British forces rigged Fort York's gunpowder magazine to explode. The blast, powerful enough to perforate eardrums and hemorrhage the lungs of some American soldiers massed outside the Fort was said to have rattled windows 50 kilometres across the lake in Niagara. It exploded as the American forces were about to enter the fort, killing Pike and a contingent of his men. In the following days, American forces sacked the town and burned a number of properties including the Parliament Buildings. The town remained occupied until May 8, when American forces departed the settlement. In addition to the Battle of York, two other American incursions occurred in the town during the war. The second incursion occurred several months later, on 31 July. An American squadron originally planned to attack British forces at Burlington Heights; although finding the British too well-entrenched in the Heights, opted to raid York instead. The landings at York went unopposed, with most York's garrison moving west to defend Burlington Heights. American forces raided the town's food and military stores, as well as destroyed several military structures before departing the same night. The third incursion into York occurred a year later, in August 1814. On 6 August 1814, an American naval squadron arrived outside of York's harbour, dispatching to enter the town's harbour in an effort to gauge its defences. After the ship briefly exchanged fire with the improved Fort York, built several hundred metres to the west from its original position, the USS Lady of the Lake withdrew and returned to the American squadron outside the harbour. American forces did not attempt a landing during this incursion, although remained outside the town's harbour for the following three days before departing. =Post-War of 1812= After the Napoleonic Wars, York experienced an influx of poor immigrants from the United Kingdom, which was in a depression. The area to the northeast of St. James' became a slum. York had a red-light district on Lombard Street and numerous taverns sprung up around St. Lawrence Market. City of Toronto (1834‚Äì1997) People celebrating the incorporation of Toronto. In 1834, the Town of York was incorporated as the new City of Toronto. The town was incorporated on March 6, 1834, reverting to the name of \\"Toronto\\" to distinguish it from New York City, as well as about a dozen other localities named 'York' in the province (including York County in which Toronto was situated), and to disassociate itself from the negative connotation of dirty Little York, a common nickname for the town by its residents. William Lyon Mackenzie was its first mayor. The new Reform-dominated municipal council quickly set to work to correct the problems left unchecked by the old Court of Quarter Sessions. Unsurprisingly for \\"Muddy York\\", the new civic corporation made roads a priority. This ambitious road improvement scheme put the new council in a difficult position; good roads were expensive, yet the incorporation bill had limited the ability of the council to raise taxes. An inequitable taxation system placed an unfair burden on the poorer members of the community. Mackenzie decided to take the matter directly to the citizens and called a public meeting at the Market Square on July 29, 1834 \\"for six, that being the hour at which the Mechanicks and labouring classes can most conveniently attend without breaking on a day's labour.\\" Mackenzie met with organized resistance, as the newly resurrected \\"British Constitutional Society\\", with William H. Draper as president, Tory aldermen Carfrae, Monro and Denison as vice-presidents, and common councilman and newspaper publisher George Gurnett as secretary, met the night before, and \\"from 150 to 200 of the most respectable portion of the community assembled and unanimously resolved to meet the Mayor upon his own invitation.\\" Sheriff William Jarvis took over the meeting and interrupted Mayor Mackenzie \\"to propose to the Meeting a vote of censure on his conduct as Mayor.\\" In the resulting pandemonium, the two sides agreed that they would hold a second meeting the next day. at Montgomery's Tavern on Yonge Street. The Tories called the meeting for three in the afternoon so that the working class \\"mechanics\\" would not be able to attend. The inability of the mechanics to attend was their saving grace, for the meeting ended in a terrible tragedy when the packed gallery overlooking Market Square collapsed, pitching the onlookers into the butcher's stalls below, killing four and injuring dozens. The Tory press immediately placed the blame on Mackenzie, even though he didn't attend. The Toronto mechanics, ironically spared the carnage because of the hour at which the meeting was appointed, did not appear to be swayed by the Tory press. In the October 1834 provincial elections, Mackenzie was overwhelmingly elected in the second riding of York; Sheriff William Jarvis, running in the city of Toronto, lost to reformer James Edward Small by the slim margin of 252 to 260 votes. Toronto was the site of the key events of the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837, led by Mackenzie. In 1841, the first gas street lamps appeared in Toronto. Over 100 were installed that year, in time for author Charles Dickens' visit in May 1842. Dickens described Toronto as \\"full of life, motion, business and improvement. The streets are well-paved and lighted with gas.\\" Dickens was on a North American tour. During the Typhus epidemic of 1847, 863 Irish immigrants died of typhus at fever sheds built at the Toronto Hospital at the northwest corner of King Street and John Street. The epidemic also killed the first Bishop of Toronto, Michael Power, while providing care and ministering to Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine. The April 7, 1849 Cathedral Fire destroyed the \\"Market Block\\" north of Market Square and St. Lawrence Market, as well as the first St. James' Cathedral and a portion of Toronto's first City Hall. While Toronto had a firefighting brigade and two fire halls, the force could not stop the large fire and many businesses were lost. A period of rebuilding followed. King and Jarvis in 1845. The buildings right of the trees were later destroyed in the Great Fire of 1849. After the Upper Canada Rebellion, resentments between the ruling factions of the Family Compact and the Reform elements in Toronto continued. As Irish and other Catholics migrated to Toronto and became a larger part of the population, the Orange Order representing Protestant elements loyal to the British Crown fought to keep control of the ruling government and civil services. The police constabulary and the fire departments were controlled through patronage and were under Orange control. Orange elements were known to use violence against Catholics and Reformers and were immune to prosecution. It would not be until the 20th Century that Toronto would have its first Catholic mayor. =Latter 19th century= Union Station in 1858 dramatically increased commerce as well as the number of immigrants. Toronto grew rapidly in the late 19th century, the population increasing from 30,000 in 1851 to 56,000 in 1871, 86,400 in 1881 and 181,000 in 1891. The total urbanized population was not counted as it is today to include the greater area, those just outside the city limits made for a significantly higher population. The 1891 figure also included population counted after recent annexations of many smaller, adjacent towns such as Parkdale, Brockton Village, West Toronto, East Toronto, and others. Immigration, high birth rates and influx from the surrounding rural population accounted for much of this growth, although immigration had slowed substantially by the 1880s if compared to the generation prior. Rail lines came to the waterfront harbour area in the 1850s. A planned \\"Esplanade\\" land- fill project to create a promenade along the harbour, instead became a new right-of-way for the rail lines, which extended to new wharves on the harbour. Three railway companies built lines to Toronto: the Grand Trunk Railway, (GTR) the Great Western Railway and Northern Railway of Canada. The GTR built the first Union Station in 1858 in the downtown area. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving and commerce, as had the Lake Ontario steamers and schooners entering the port. The railway lands would dominate the central waterfront for the next 100 years. In 1873, GTR built a second Union Station at the same location. New rail transportation networks were built in Toronto, including an extensive streetcar network in the city (still operational), plus long-distance railways and radial lines. One radial line ran mostly along Yonge Street for about 80 km to Lake Simcoe, and allowed day trips to its beaches. At the time, Toronto's own beaches were far too polluted to use, largely a side effect of dumping garbage directly in the lake. Other radial lines connected to suburbs. Horse-drawn streetcars in downtown Toronto in 1890. As the city grew, it became bounded by the Humber River to the west and the Don River to the east. Several smaller rivers and creeks in the downtown area were routed into culverts and sewers and the land filled in above them, including both Garrison Creek and Taddle Creek, the latter running through the University of Toronto. Much of Castle Frank Brook became covered during this time. At the time, they were being used as open sewers and were becoming a serious health problem. The re-configuration of the Don River mouth to make a ship channel and lakeshore reclamation project occurred in the 1880s, again largely driven by sanitary concerns and establishing effective port commerce. Toronto had two medical schools, both independent: Trinity Medical School and the Toronto School of Medicine (TSM). During the 1880s, the TSM added instructors, expanded its curriculum, and focused on clinical instruction. Enrollments grew at both schools. Critics found proprietary schools lacking especially for their failure to offer sufficient instruction in the basic sciences. In 1887, the TSM became the medical faculty of the University of Toronto, increasing its emphasis on research within the medical curriculum. Trinity realized that its survival depended as well on close ties to basic science, and in 1904 it also merged into the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine.R. D. Gidney, and W. P. J. Millar, \\"The Reorientation of Medical Education in Late Nineteenth-Century Ontario: The Proprietary Medical Schools and the Founding of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto\\", Journal of the History of Medicine & Allied Sciences, Jan 1994, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 52-78 Toronto modernized and professionalized its public services in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. No service was changed more dramatically than the Toronto Police. The introduction of emergency telephone call boxes linked to a central dispatcher, plus bicycles, motorcycles and automobiles shifted the patrolman's duties from passively walking the beat to fast reaction to reported incidents, as well as handling automobile traffic.Bill Rawling, \\"Technology and Innovation in the Toronto Police Force, 1875‚Äì1925\\", Ontario History, Mar 1988, Vol. 80 Issue 1, pp 53-71 After the Great Fire of 1849, Toronto improved its fire code. This was followed by an expansion of the fire services and the eventual formation of Toronto Fire Services in 1874. The Crystal Palace at the grounds of the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, 1871 In 1879, the first Toronto Industrial Exhibition was held. A provincial Agricultural Fair was held in Ontario on a rotating basis since the 1850s, and after Toronto held the 1878 exhibition at King and Shaw streets, it wanted to hold the fair again. The request was turned down and the Industrial Exhibition was organized. The City arranged a lease of the garrison commons and moved its Crystal Palace building to the site. Eventually, the garrison commons became taken over by the Exhibition and the annual exhibition continues today as the Canadian National Exhibition. The grounds became Exhibition Place and hold sports venues, exhibition venues, trade and convention space used year-round. Immigration The Great Irish Famine (1845‚Äì1849) brought a large number of Irish into the city, a slight majority of whom were Protestant. The huge unexpected influx of very poor immigrants brought a new challenge to the Catholic Church. Its fear was that Protestants might use their material needs as a wedge for evangelization. In response, the Church built a network of charitable institutions such as hospitals, schools, boarding homes, and orphanages, to meet the need and keep people inside the faith.Murray Nicholson, \\"The Growth of Roman Catholic Institutions in the Archdiocese of Toronto, 1841-90\\", in Terrence Murphy and Gerald Stortz, eds, Creed and Culture: The Place of English-Speaking Catholics in Canadian Society, 1750 ‚Äì 1930 (1993) pp 152-170 The Catholic Church was less successful in dealing with tensions between the French and the Irish Catholic clergy; eventually the Irish took control and won the support of Rome by its unwavering ultramontane (pro-Vatican) position.Paula Maurutto, Governing Charities: Church and State in Toronto: Catholic Archdioces, 1850‚Äì1950 (McGill-Queen's University Press, 2001)Mark G. McGowan, Michael Power: The Struggle to Build the Catholic Church on the Canadian Frontier (2007) By 1851, the Irish-born population became the largest single ethnic group in the city. Orange Order parade on King Street, c. 1870. The fraternal organization, originally made up of Irish immigrants, became a dominant force in Toronto during the late 19th century. The Orange Order, based among the Protestant Irish, became a dominant force in Toronto society, so much so that 1920s Toronto was called the \\"Belfast of Canada\\". The Orange opposed everything Catholic. They lost interest in Ireland after the establishment of Northern Ireland and the Orange influence faded after 1940.see Orange Canada Irish Catholics arriving in Toronto faced widespread intolerance and severe discrimination, both social and legislative, leading to several large scale riots between Catholics and Protestants from 1858‚Äì1878, culminating in the Jubilee riots of 1875. The Irish population essentially defined the Catholic population in Toronto until 1890, when German and French Catholics were welcomed to the city by the Irish, but the Irish proportion still remained 90% of the Catholic population. However, various positive initiatives such as the foundation of St. Michael's College in 1852, three hospitals, and the most significant charitable organizations in the city (the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul) and House of Providence created by Irish Catholic groups strengthened the Irish identity, transforming the Irish presence in the city into one of influence and power. McGowan argues that between 1890 and 1920, the city's Catholics experienced major social, ideological, and economic changes that allowed them to integrate into Toronto society and shake off their second-class status. The Irish Catholics (in contrast to the French) strongly supported Canada's role in the First World War. They broke out of the ghetto and lived in all of Toronto's neighbourhoods. Starting as unskilled labourers, they used high levels of education to move up and were well represented among the lower middle class. Most dramatically, they intermarried with Protestants at an unprecedented rate. During the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century, the Irish immigrants who had followed the British to Toronto were followed by many other immigrant groups in the late 19th century: Germans, Italians, and Jews from various parts of Eastern Europe; later Chinese, Russians, Finns, Poles, and many other eastern Europeans. By the latter half of the 20th century, refugees and immigrants from many other parts of the world were the major source of immigration. British immigration remained strong through the latter half of the 19th century well into the 20th century, in addition to a steady influx from rural areas of Ontario, which included French-Canadians. =20th century= Great Fire of Toronto of 1904 was a large fire that destroyed much of Downtown Toronto. By 1900, the centre of business had moved west of the historical Town of York site. A new downtown to the west of Yonge and King Streets was built. The City of Toronto moved into a new City Hall, built at the head of Bay Street at Queen Street. Much of this new downtown was destroyed in the Great Toronto Fire of 1904, but it was quickly rebuilt, with new taller buildings. South of downtown, the railways dominated most of the lands. A new viaduct was built to carry the main lines and eliminate the many at-level crossings. A single Union Station was built to replace the several railway stations of the rail lines. It sat empty for a while over disagreements between government and the rail companies. The Don River has an especially deep ravine, cutting off the east of the city at most points north of the lakeshore. This was addressed in October 1918, when the construction of the Prince Edward Viaduct, was finalized, linking Bloor Street on the western side of the ravine with Danforth Avenue on the east. The designer, Edmund Burke, fought long and hard to have a lower deck added to the bridge for trains, a cost the city was not willing to provide for. Nevertheless, he finally got his way, and thereby saved the city millions of dollars when the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway started using the deck in 1966. Entrepreneurship was exemplified by the career of John Northway (1848‚Äì1926). Beginning as a tailor in a small town, he moved to Toronto and soon developed a chain of department stores. His innovations in the sewing and marketing of ladies' wear enabled the emergence of a Canadian ladies' garment industry. Northway pioneered modern business methods and accounting methods. He innovated as well in labour relations, as a pioneer in sickness and accident compensation and profit-sharing schemes. A millionaire by 1910, he played a leading role in Toronto's civic life.G. Alan Wilson, \\"John Northway's Career: An Approach to Ontario's History\\", Ontario History, March 1964, Vol. 56 Issue 1, pp 37-44 In 1923, two researchers at the University of Toronto, J.J.R. Macleod (1876‚Äì1935) and Frederick Banting (1891‚Äì1941), shared the Nobel prize in Medicine for their 1921 discovery of insulin, putting Toronto on the world map of advanced science.J. M. Fenster, \\"The Conquest of Diabetes\\", American Heritage of Invention & Technology, Jan 1999, Vol. 14 Issue 3, pp 48-55 From 1926 to 1936, Toronto lawyer, financier, and practical joker Charles Vance Millar created the Great Stork Derby, a contest in which women had to give birth to the most babies within a ten-year period after his death, in order to qualify for an unusual bequest in his will for a residue of his significant estate. Toronto skyline in July 1930. In 1944, the 1,000th Canadian-built vessel since the start of World War II was launched in Toronto. During the war, most of the city's industries were converted for war-time production. 1939‚Äì1970 During World War II, Toronto became a major centre for Canada's military. The Exhibition Place was taken over for military training and deployment. The Island Airport was taken over for training of the Royal Norwegian Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force. Civilian manufacturing companies, such as Inglis, were converted to war-time production of armaments. At Malton Airport and Downsview Airport, new aviation factories built many fighters and bombers to be used in Europe. After World War II, a continuous influx of newcomers from Atlantic Canada and large numbers of immigrants from around the world contributed to the steady growth of Toronto. The large numbers of new Canadians helped Toronto's population swell to over one million by 1951, and double again to over two million, by 1971. The demographics of Toronto changed as a result also, as many immigrants were from countries other than Great Britain. The ethnic diversity grew and saw the development of enclaves such as Little Italy, Little Portugal and two new Chinatowns. In 1967, the first \\"Caribana\\" festival was held celebrating the culture of the West Indies. The provincial government created the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, a regional government that incorporated numerous local municipalities in 1954. The Metro Toronto government took over the construction and maintenance of region-wide infrastructure, building water treatment plants, roads, public transit and expressways, to facilitate the growth of the suburbs.Albert Rose, Governing metropolitan Toronto: A social and political analysis, 1953‚Äì1971 (1972.) In 1954, Hurricane Hazel swept through Toronto, causing significant flooding and damage. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel swept through Toronto, causing significant flooding; 81 people were killed. As a result, building on floodplains was banned, new flood control works such as dams and flood channels were built, and the lands of floodplains were cleared of buildings, conserved as park lands and conservation areas. In 1954, the original stretch of the subway was completed from Union to Eglinton stations on the Yonge line (later numbered as Line 1). This was followed by the construction of the Bloor-Danforth and University Avenue subways, connecting the core to the suburbs to the east and west. The Metro Government built the Gardiner Expressway and the DVP expressways in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but plans to build a large network of expressways throughout the city died in 1971 with the cancellation of the Spadina Expressway. Metro proceeded to build the Spadina subway line north into North York and extended the Yonge line north into North York. The new \\"urban renewal\\" movement made its influence felt in Toronto. Large areas, deemed \\"slums\\", were cleared. This included the areas of Regent Park, Lawrence Heights and Alexandria Park. The streets and small homes were replaced by mega-blocks with limited streets and apartment buildings. The experiment in social housing would improve the number of affordable units available, at the expense of a large increase in the budgets of Metro and Toronto to maintain the buildings. By the 2000s, Toronto would be in serious arrears on maintenance, and in the 2000s, Toronto has started to dismantle the large projects and replace them with designs more resembling regular neighbourhoods.Kevin Brushett, \\"Blots on the Face of the City: The Politics of Slum Housing and Urban Renewal in Toronto, 1940‚Äì1970\\" (PhD thesis, Queen's U., 2001) online The opening for the fourth Toronto City Hall in 1965. The modernist design of the building have made it a landmark of the city. During the 1960s and 1970s, Toronto's downtown core was rebuilt with new, taller, skyscrapers. A new Toronto City Hall was opened; the Eaton Centre shopping and office complex; four new bank towers were built at the intersection of Bay and King Streets, the \\"MINT corners\\" and new towers along University Avenue. This was causing havoc with the city's old television and radio towers which were simply not tall enough to serve the city, so engineers and politicians decided that something had to be built taller than any other building in the city or anything that would probably ever be built. They decided to build a super-tall massive television and radio tower (the CN Tower), which was completed in 1976 on the railway lands south of downtown. Around the downtown core, which had been dominated by railway lands since the 1850s, new land uses were found for the railway lands. The St. Lawrence Neighbourhood project built a new community from old rail lands to the east of Yonge. Along the waterfront, new office and residential towers were built on former industrial lands. The new SkyDome stadium (later renamed Rogers Centre in 2005) was built in 1989 on rail lands downtown. South of King Street, west of University Avenue, more railway and warehouse lands were converted, seeing the opening of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, a new CBC English-language headquarters; Roy Thomson Hall concert hall and the Princess of Wales Theatre.John Sewell, The shape of the city: Toronto struggles with modern planning (U of Toronto Press, 1993) 1970‚Äì1997 During the 1970s, the population of Toronto continued to grow and surpassed that of Montreal. In 1971 the populations of the respective Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) for Toronto and Montreal stood at 2.7 million and 2.6 million. By 1981 Toronto had surpassed Montreal with a population of 3 million versus 2.8 million for Montreal. Factors for the growth of Toronto over Montreal included strong immigration, increasingly by Asians and people of African descent, the increasing size of the auto industry in Southern Ontario, due to the signing of the Auto Pact with the US in 1965, a calmer political environment (Quebec experienced two referenda on separation during these years, one in 1980 and the other in 1995), and lower personal income taxes than in Quebec.Harold Troper, \\"Becoming an immigrant city: A history of immigration into Toronto since the Second World War\\" by Paul Anisef and Michael Lanphier, eds. The world in a city (2003) pp: 19-62. Construction of First Canadian Place, the operational headquarters of the Bank of Montreal, in 1975. The 1970s saw several Canadian financial institutions move to Toronto. Toronto had been the junior partner in Canadian business to Montreal historically. This changed as Toronto grew rapidly after World War II. Another factor was the growing nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly with the success of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in 1976, systematically alienated Anglophone businesses. By 1995, Toronto controlled 48% of Canada's financial assets and 44% of the non- financial corporate assets, compared to 28% and 22% by Montreal. During this period, three of Canada's largest banks became headquartered in Toronto: the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. These along with the Manulife Financial Corporation, Sun Life Financial Inc. and Toronto Stock Exchange form the financial district, the financial heart of Canada. Toronto also became the corporate capital of Canada with the majority of Canadian companies having their head offices there. Notable examples include: George Weston Limited, Onex Corporation, Magna International Inc., Wal-Mart Canada Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. Toronto strengthened its position as the cultural centre of English-speaking Canada during these years. The Globe and Mail and the National Post, two of Canada's most important newspapers have their head offices there. The new CBC Canadian Broadcasting Centre was completed in 1993 and became the corporation's control facility for English language broadcasting in Canada. Also in 1993, Ryerson Polytechnical Institute gained full university status and became Ryerson Polytechnic University. Roy Thomson Hall became the home of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1982. This along with the newly constructed Princess of Wales Theatre and the venerable Royal Alexandra Theatre now form the heart of the theatre district. Cultural institutions including the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Royal Ontario Museum have had their buildings renovated. The Four Seasons Centre became the new home of the Canadian Opera Company and National Ballet of Canada when completed in 2006. The Toronto Film Festival, established in 1976, has become after Cannes, the most important in the world and now sports a new headquarters, the TIFF Bell Lightbox, opened in 2010. Film production has received a boost with the newly completed, Pinewood Toronto Studios, in the east end of the waterfront. Toronto has also been home to the Hockey Hall of Fame (1943), since 1961. The changing high-rise downtown core provided visual evidence of growth. New skyscrapers included, the Royal Trust Tower, 1969, First Canadian Place, 1975, the CN Tower, 1975, Royal Bank Plaza, South Tower, 1977, the First Bank Tower, 1979, Scotia Plaza, 1988, the SkyDome, 1989, the BCE Place‚ÄìCanada Trust Tower, 1990 and the Bay Wellington Tower, 1990. New skyscrapers include: One King Street West, 2005, West 1, 2005, Harbourview Estates 2, 2005, Residences of College Park 1, Toronto, 2006, Quantum 2 (Minto Midtown), 2008, the Bay Adelaide Centre West, 2009, the RBC Centre, 2009, Success, 2009 and Montage, 2009. The former Toronto Stock Exchange building incorporated into the Toronto-Dominion Centre. The city began to designate heritage buildings in the 1970s, forcing some developers to incorporate them in their designs. The loss of many of the old buildings in the downtown saw a new interest among Toronto's citizens to preserve heritage buildings and the City of Toronto began designating buildings to prevent their demolition. The Toronto City Council in the 1970s was dominated by reformers such as David Crombie and John Sewell; opposed to the pace and destructive aspects of Toronto's sudden growth. A by-law was put into place temporarily halting skyscraper construction while land use controls and the official plan was updated. In the 1990s, Toronto was affected by the country-wide recession. As well, the senior-level governments of Canada and Ontario downloaded the delivery of services. The Ontario government transferred a section of the Queen Elizabeth Way to the Metro Gardiner Expressway, cancelled the Eglinton subway line and trimmed transit, housing and welfare subsidies. The Canadian government formed independent agencies to manage the Toronto International Airport and the Toronto Harbour; the latter particular controversial to Toronto as Toronto City Council wanted to take over the harbour as part of waterfront revitalization efforts. As well, the Canadian government eliminated its public housing programs. These changes would lead to budget crises for the Toronto government of the 2000s. Amalgamated Toronto (1998‚Äìpresent) Municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto prior to its dissolution. In 1998, the six municipalities were dissolved and amalgamated, forming the new city of Toronto. On January 1, 1998, Toronto was greatly enlarged, not through traditional annexations, but as an amalgamation of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and its six lower-tier constituent municipalities; East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, York, and the original city itself. They were dissolved by an act of the Government of Ontario, and formed into a single-tier City of Toronto (colloquially dubbed the \\"megacity\\") replacing all six governments. The merger was proposed as a cost-saving measure by the Progressive Conservative provincial government under Mike Harris. The announcement touched off vociferous public objections. In March 1997, a referendum in all six municipalities produced a vote of more than 3‚à∂1 against amalgamation.Chidley, Joe; Hawelshka, Danilo. Toronto's struggle against amalgamation . Maclean's, 1997-03-17. However, municipal governments in Canada are creatures of the provincial governments, and referendums have little to no legal effect. The Harris government could thus legally ignore the results of the referendum, and did so in April when it tabled the City of Toronto Act. Both opposition parties held a filibuster in the provincial legislature, proposing more than 12,000 amendments that allowed residents on streets of the proposed megacity take part in public hearings on the merger and adding historical designations to the streets. This only delayed the bill's inevitable passage, given the PCO's majority. North York mayor Mel Lastman became the first \\"megacity\\" mayor, and the 62nd Mayor of Toronto, with his electoral victory. Lastman gained national attention after multiple snowstorms, including the January Blizzard of 1999, dumped 118 cm of snow and effectively immobilized the city. He called in the Canadian Army to aid snow removal by use of their equipment to augment police and emergency services. The move was ridiculed by some in other parts of the country, fueled in part by what was perceived as a frivolous use of resources.Barnes, Alan (1999-01-16). 'World class wimps' receive little sympathy, The Toronto Star, p. A22. =21st century= In 2001, Toronto finished second to Beijing in voting by the International Olympic Committee for the host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Toronto's bid to host the games failed after mayor Mel Lastman, while on a visit to Kenya in order to gain support from African Olympic delegates, shocked and insulted his hosts, when he said, \\"Why the hell would I want to go to a place like Mombasa? I just see myself in a pot of boiling water with all these natives dancing around me.\\"James Rusk, \\"Lastman apologizes for cannibal joke on eve of Kenya trip\\", Globe and Mail, p. A1, 21 June 2001. In 2002, Toronto hosted World Youth Day 2002 and a visit by Pope John Paul II. The municipal government's two largest unions, Locals 79 and 416 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, went on strike several weeks before the scheduled event, meaning that certain basic services, such as day care and parks programs, were not available. Since city workers also pick up garbage and recycling, city parks became piled high with rubbish ‚Äì some parks were designated official dump sites for the duration of the strike, while others were used illegally. The situation was resolved when the Ontario government tabled back-to-work legislation to end the strike, and the city was back to normal before the start of World Youth Day. TTC streetcar is left stranded after the city lost power in the Northeast blackout of 2003. In early 2003, Toronto was affected by the SARS epidemic. Although the disease was primarily confined to hospitals and health-care workers, tourism in Toronto suffered significantly because of media reports. To help recover the losses the city suffered in industries and tourism, the city held the SARS Benefit Concert (colloquially termed SARSStock), which attracted 450,000 people in late July, making it one of the ten largest concerts in history. Two weeks later, the city was also affected by the 2003 North America blackout. In the resulting chaos, the city ground to a halt, with people taking to the streets to party and talk to their neighbours. Power was not restored for more than 12 hours; in some isolated pockets, not for up to three days. In the November 2003 municipal election, David Miller was elected to replace Mel Lastman as mayor, after running a successful campaign which included a promise to cancel the proposed bridge to Toronto Island Airport. According to a 2004 United Nations report, Toronto has the second-highest proportion of immigrants in the world, after Miami, Florida. Almost half of Toronto's residents were born outside Canada. The resulting cultural diversity is reflected in the numerous ethnic neighbourhoods of the city. The proliferation of shops and restaurants derived from cultures around the world makes the city one of the most exciting places in the world to visit. Moreover, the relative tranquility that mediates between such diverse populations is a testament to the perceived tolerant character of Canadian society. Official photo of world leaders at the 2010 G20 Toronto summit. Toronto hosted the G20 summit on June 26‚Äì27, 2010, but it was not without protests. The protests were met with one of the most expensive temporary security operations seen in Canada and resulted in the largest mass arrests in Canadian history. Later that year, councillor Rob Ford was elected mayor of the city. His support was based on voters in the former suburbs, with the exception of East York; there, Ford remained highly unpopular with local residents, who at one point at East York's 2014 Canada Day parade, was heckled so mercilessly, he left the parade halfway through its route. Ford's election victory highlighted a political schism between the core and suburban Toronto over spending and services at City Hall. During his four-year term drew media coverage from incidents of public drunkenness and driving while under the influence of alcohol, urinating on the grounds of an elementary school in broad daylight, numerous homophobic statements and actions, a drunken imitation of a Jamaican accent, making sexually obscene remarks, spreading a conspiracy theory that \\"Oriental\\" people were secretly plotting to take over the country, tackling a female councillor to the ground at City Hall, and threatening to murder his own mother-in-law on Christmas Day. Ford drew global media attention after it became public that he smoked crack-cocaine. Ultimately, City Council suspended his powers and Ford entered into drug rehab. Favourable economic conditions and a high demand for housing spurred a condo boom in Toronto, with tens of thousands of upscale apartments constructed throughout the city. On July 8, 2013, severe flash flooding hit Toronto after an afternoon of slow-moving, intense thunderstorms. Toronto Hydro estimated 450,000 people were without power after the storm and Toronto Pearson International Airport reported of rain had fallen over five hours, more than during Hurricane Hazel. Within six months, on December 20, 2013, Toronto was brought to a halt by the worst ice storm in the city's history, rivalling the severity of the 1998 Ice Storm. At the height of the storm over 300,000 Toronto Hydro customers had no electricity or heating. Toronto hosted WorldPride in June 2014, and the Pan American Games in 2015. The city continues to grow and attract immigrants. A study by Ryerson University showed that Toronto was the fastest-growing city in North America. The city added 77,435 people between July 2017 and July 2018. The Toronto metropolitan area was the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in North America, adding 125,298 persons, compared to 131,767 in Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington in Texas. The large growth in the Toronto metropolitan area is attributed to international migration to Toronto. On March 23, 2020, a state of emergency was declared in Toronto by mayor John Tory, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto. This came six days after Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in the province, which included prohibition of all public events of over 50 people (later reduced to 5 people on March 28), closure of bars and restaurants (with the exception that restaurants may continue to provide takeout and delivery services) as well as libraries, theatres, cinemas, schools and daycares.

In fact, the first of the four Venetian Doges of the Candiano family, Pietro, died on 18 September 887 in a battle against the Croatian tribe of Neretvans who defeated the Venetian fleet near Makarska. After his defeat the Venetians made a treaty with Prince Branimir in 888, agreeing to pay a tribute to the Croatian rulers for the right to sail and trade unmolested along the Adriatic, which they had to adhere to until the end of the 10th century.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 307, Zagreb (1999), Notable natives and residents *Marin Brbiƒá, president of Hajduk Split *Dra≈æen Laliƒá, sociologist *≈Ωanamari Laliƒá, singer *Ani Mijaƒçika, tennis player See also * List of mountains in Croatia ReferencesExternal links * Tourist Board Tuƒçepi * Tuƒçepi Photos * Doge Pietro I Candiano died on 18 September 887 in a battle against Narentines Category:Municipalities of Croatia Category:Populated places in Split-Dalmatia County Category:Populated coastal places in Croatia Category:Seaside resorts in Croatia ","title":"Tuƒçepi"},{"id":"2474806","text":"Frederick Earl \\"Shorty\\" Long (May 20, 1940 ‚Äì June 29, 1969) was an American soul singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer for Motown's Soul Records imprint. He was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1980. Career Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Long came to Motown in 1963 from the Tri-Phi/Harvey label, owned by Berry Gordy's sister, Gwen, and her husband, Harvey Fuqua. His first release, \\"Devil with the Blue Dress On\\" (1964), written with William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson, was the first recording issued on Motown's Soul label, a subsidiary designed for more blues-based artists such as Long. While this song never charted nationally, the song was covered and made a hit in 1966 by Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. Long's 1966 single \\"Function at the Junction\\" was his first popular hit, reaching No. 42 on the national R&B; charts. Other single releases included \\"It's a Crying Shame\\" (1964), \\"Chantilly Lace\\" (1967), and \\"Night Fo' Last\\" (1968). Long's biggest hit was \\"Here Comes the Judge\\" which in July 1968 reached No. 4 on the R&B; charts and No. 8 eight on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was inspired by a comic act on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In about a judge by Pigmeat Markham, whose own \\"Here Comes the Judge\\" - a similar song with different lyrics - charted three weeks after Long's, also in July 1968, and reached No. 19 on Billboard. Long's 1969 singles included \\"I Had a Dream\\" and \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\". He released one album during his lifetime, Here Comes the Judge (1968). Long played many instruments, including piano, organ, drums, harmonica, and trumpet. He acted as an MC for many of the Motortown Revue shows and tours, and co-wrote several of his tunes (\\"Devil with the Blue Dress On\\", \\"Function at the Junction\\", and \\"Here Comes the Judge\\"). Long was the only Motown artist besides Smokey Robinson who was allowed to produce his own recordings in the 1960s. Marvin Gaye, in David Ritz's biography Divided Soul: The Life & Times of Marvin Gaye, described Shorty Long as \\"this beautiful cat who had two hits, and then got ignored by Motown.\\" Gaye claimed he \\"fought for guys like Shorty\\" while at Motown, since no one ever pushed for these artists. When Holland- Dozier-Holland came to Gaye with a tune, he stated, \\"Why are you going to produce me? Why don't you produce Shorty Long?\\" Death On June 29, 1969, Long and a friend drowned when their boat crashed on the Detroit River in Michigan. Stevie Wonder played the harmonica at his burial, and placed it on his casket afterwards. Writer Roger Green's epitaph stated: \\"So there endeth the career of a man who sang what he wanted to sing ‚Äì everything from the blues to romantic ballads, from wild and crazy numbers to a utopian vision of Heaven on Earth. Short in stature but big in talent, he entertained and amazed us, and finally he inspired us.\\" accompanying booklet to \\"The Complete Motown Singles Vol. 9, 1968\\", (2007), Motown Records, p. 82)] Motown released Long's final album, The Prime of Shorty Long, shortly after his death.

This declaration followed the defeat of Domingo Monteverde by Bol√≠var during the Admirable Campaign in the west and Santiago Mari√±o in his campaign in the east. The republic came to an end in the following year, after a series of defeats at the hands of Jos√© Tom√°s Boves.  Antecedents: Cartagena Manifesto  After the fall of the first Venezuelan Republic, colonel Simon Bolivar went into exile and headed for Cura√ßao. Soon after, he set sail for the United Provinces of New Granada, which had just recently declared its independence from the Spanish Empire. In Cartagena, Bolivar penned a letter, the Cartagena Manifesto, in which he described the reasons that led to the fall of the First Republic, the current situation of Hispanic America, and his perspective on the future of the region. Bolivar asked the New Granadian congress for his incorporation into the army, and was quickly promoted to the rank of Brigadier and assigned to a garrison. He then organized a flash campaign between Tunja and Pamplona, managing the expulsion of the royalist troops from this region. With the royalists in retreat, Bolivar once again addressed the New Granadian congress for authorization to intervene in Venezuela with an army of volunteers. In view of the actions Bolivar had executed in favor of the New Granadians, the congress granted his request and Bolivar marched into Venezuela.  Admirable Campaign  Use of the term in Venezuelan history  It is during this period that the term \\"Republic of Venezuela\\" was officially used by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's government. During the First Republic, upon which Bol√≠var based the legitimacy of his actions, the government referred to the Venezuelan state as either the \\"American Confederation of Venezuela\\" or the \\"United Provinces of Venezuela\\" in the Declaration of Independence (both terms are used interchangeably),In Spanish: Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes or as the \\"United States of Venezuela\\" (a term used interchangeably with \\"the Confederation\\") in the Constitution of 1811.In Spanish: Federal Constitution of 1811 Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes Third Republic of Venezuela Historians use the name Third Republic of Venezuela to refer to the period from about 1817 to 1819, when a rump government organized by Bol√≠var began functioning in the Venezuelan Llanos. The year before, various Venezuelan guerrilla forces managed to permanently establish themselves in the Llanos and captured the city of Angostura, which became their headquarters. This period culminated with the formation of the Congress of Angostura in 1819, which wrote a new constitution for Venezuela, replacing the one from 1811, which in theory, was still valid, although suspended since the collapse of the First Republic in 1812. The congress decreed the union of Venezuela with New Granada in a new republic, known as Gran Colombia, bringing an end to the Third Republic. From 1820 to 1830, the territory of Venezuela was the Department of Venezuela within Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, Venezuela became once again the Republic of Venezuela, and, although undergoing various changes in constitutions and forms of government, it permanently maintained its independence from that moment on. This period is seen as a stable Fourth Republic of Venezuela.

Measures of goodness of fit typically summarize the discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model in question. Such measures can be used in statistical hypothesis testing, e.g. to test for normality of residuals, to test whether two samples are drawn from identical distributions (see Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test), or whether outcome frequencies follow a specified distribution (see Pearson's chi-squared test). In the analysis of variance, one of the components into which the variance is partitioned may be a lack-of-fit sum of squares. Fit of distributions In assessing whether a given distribution is suited to a data-set, the following tests and their underlying measures of fit can be used: *Bayesian information criterion *Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test *Cram√©r‚Äìvon Mises criterion *Anderson‚ÄìDarling test *Shapiro‚ÄìWilk test *Chi-squared test *Akaike information criterion *Hosmer‚ÄìLemeshow test *Kuiper's test *Kernelized Stein discrepancy *Zhang's ZK, ZC and ZA tests *Moran test Regression analysis In regression analysis, the following topics relate to goodness of fit: * Coefficient of determination (the R-squared measure of goodness of fit); * Lack-of-fit sum of squares; * Reduced chi-squared * Regression validation * Mallows's Cp criterion Categorical data The following are examples that arise in the context of categorical data. =Pearson's chi-squared test= Pearson's chi-squared test uses a measure of goodness of fit which is the sum of differences between observed and expected outcome frequencies (that is, counts of observations), each squared and divided by the expectation: : \\\\chi^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n {\\\\frac{(O_i - E_i)}{E_i}^2} where: :Oi = an observed count for bin i :Ei = an expected count for bin i, asserted by the null hypothesis. The expected frequency is calculated by: :E_i \\\\, = \\\\, \\\\bigg( F(Y_u) \\\\, - \\\\, F(Y_l) \\\\bigg) \\\\, N where: :F = the cumulative distribution function for the probability distribution being tested. :Yu = the upper limit for class i, :Yl = the lower limit for class i, and :N = the sample size The resulting value can be compared with a chi-squared distribution to determine the goodness of fit. The chi-squared distribution has (k ‚àí c) degrees of freedom, where k is the number of non-empty cells and c is the number of estimated parameters (including location and scale parameters and shape parameters) for the distribution plus one. For example, for a 3-parameter Weibull distribution, c = 4. Example: equal frequencies of men and women For example, to test the hypothesis that a random sample of 100 people has been drawn from a population in which men and women are equal in frequency, the observed number of men and women would be compared to the theoretical frequencies of 50 men and 50 women. If there were 44 men in the sample and 56 women, then : \\\\chi^2 = {(44 - 50)^2 \\\\over 50} + {(56 - 50)^2 \\\\over 50} = 1.44 If the null hypothesis is true (i.e., men and women are chosen with equal probability in the sample), the test statistic will be drawn from a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. Though one might expect two degrees of freedom (one each for the men and women), we must take into account that the total number of men and women is constrained (100), and thus there is only one degree of freedom (2 ‚àí 1). In other words, if the male count is known the female count is determined, and vice versa. Consultation of the chi-squared distribution for 1 degree of freedom shows that the probability of observing this difference (or a more extreme difference than this) if men and women are equally numerous in the population is approximately 0.23. This probability is higher than conventional criteria for statistical significance (.001-.05), so normally we would not reject the null hypothesis that the number of men in the population is the same as the number of women (i.e. we would consider our sample within the range of what we'd expect for a 50/50 male/female ratio.) Note the assumption that the mechanism that has generated the sample is random, in the sense of independent random selection with the same probability, here 0.5 for both males and females. If, for example, each of the 44 males selected brought a male buddy, and each of the 56 females brought a female buddy, each {(O_i - E_i)}^2 will increase by a factor of 4, while each E_i will increase by a factor of 2. The value of the statistic will double to 2.88. Knowing this underlying mechanism, we should of course be counting pairs. In general, the mechanism, if not defensibly random, will not be known. The distribution to which the test statistic should be referred may, accordingly, be very different from chi-squared. Binomial case A binomial experiment is a sequence of independent trials in which the trials can result in one of two outcomes, success or failure. There are n trials each with probability of success, denoted by p. Provided that npi ‚â´ 1 for every i (where i = 1, 2, ..., k), then \\\\chi^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} {\\\\frac{(N_i - np_i)^2}{np_i}} = \\\\sum_{\\\\mathrm{all\\\\ cells}}^{} {\\\\frac{(\\\\mathrm{O} - \\\\mathrm{E})^2}{\\\\mathrm{E}}}. This has approximately a chi-squared distribution with k ‚àí 1 degrees of freedom. The fact that there are k ‚àí 1 degrees of freedom is a consequence of the restriction \\\\sum N_i=n. We know there are k observed cell counts, however, once any k ‚àí 1 are known, the remaining one is uniquely determined. Basically, one can say, there are only k ‚àí 1 freely determined cell counts, thus k ‚àí 1 degrees of freedom. =G-test= G-tests are likelihood-ratio tests of statistical significance that are increasingly being used in situations where Pearson's chi-squared tests were previously recommended. The general formula for G is : G = 2\\\\sum_{i} {O_{i} \\\\cdot \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{O_i}{E_i}\\\\right)}, where O_i and E_i are the same as for the chi-squared test, \\\\ln denotes the natural logarithm, and the sum is taken over all non-empty cells. Furthermore, the total observed count should be equal to the total expected count:\\\\sum_i O_i = \\\\sum_i E_i = Nwhere N is the total number of observations. G-tests have been recommended at least since the 1981 edition of the popular statistics textbook by Robert R. Sokal and F. James Rohlf.

Overview The idea of prison reform was promoted in the early 19th century by Elizabeth Fry and her brother Joseph John Gurney. In particular, Fry was appalled at the conditions in the women's section of Newgate Prison. This act was introduced and supported by Home Secretary Robert Peel. It introduced regular visits to prisoners by chaplains; provided for the payment of gaolers, who had previously been paid out of fees that the prisoners themselves were required to pay; stated that female and male prisoners should be kept separated as well as requiring the installation of female wardens to guard female prisoners; and prohibited the use of irons and manacles. It also lifted the death penalty from 130 crimes. The act was largely ineffective, because there were no inspectors to make sure that it was being followed. The Prisons Act 1835 offered a remedy by providing for the appointment of five paid prison inspectors. This helped to stop the exploitation of prisoners.

Filaments in the colonies can slide back and forth against each other until the whole mass is reoriented to its light source. It is commonly found in watering-troughs waters, and is mainly blue- green or brown-green. Oscillatoria is an organism that reproduces by fragmentation. Oscillatoria forms long filaments of cells which can break into fragments called hormogonia. The hormogonia can grow into a new, longer filament. Breaks in the filament usually occur where dead cells (necridia) are present. It occur in fresh water ponds. Oscillatoria uses photosynthesis to survive and reproduce. Each filament of oscillatoria consists of trichome which is made up of rows of cells. The tip of the trichome oscillates like a pendulum. in reproduction, it takes place by vegetative means only. Usually the filament breaks into a number of fragments called homogonia. Each hormogonium consist of one or more cells and grow into a filament by cell division in one direction. Oscillatoria are the subject of research into the natural production of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), an antioxidant, food additive and industrial chemical.

It was set up as an Australian wildlife sanctuary and tourist attraction in the South Bank Parklands, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, following World Expo 88. There were about 500 animals at the sanctuary. The Sanctuary was created as a huge bird aviary with a range of display dioramas throughout and a series of outer and inner sculpted concrete panels artistically coated and sprayed to look like rock. The sanctuary featured many species of Australian birds, including fairy wrens, figbirds, bowerbirds, kingfishers, curlews, lorikeets, parrots, finches, pigeons, doves, geese, teals and cockatoos, among others of the land birds - as well as various species of waterfowl. Australian mammals at the sanctuary included fruit bats, while marsupials included koalas, wallabies, pademelons, gliders (including squirrel gliders, sugar gliders and greater glider), as well as eastern quolls, bandicoots, possums and Tasmanian devils. There were also echidnas (one of two species of monotremes). Featured reptiles included Australian lizards and snakes, freshwater crocodiles, turtles and goannas. Other wildlife included frogs and fish, including the lungfish. The Sanctuary included a series of educational displays outlining the creation of Australia through Gondwanan times and the evolution of Australian animals. A number of large animated Australian dinosaurs allowed visitors to step back into time. At the same time as the wildlife sanctuary, there was a Butterfly House (later renamed as the Butterfly and Insect House), as well as canals and bridges and launches. The Sanctuary went into receivership in 1993 due to the cost over runs caused due to a lack of access to the site during a very wet construction period. In January, 1998, Gondwana Rainforest Sanctuary was closed down and the animals relocated. A rainforest walk and green space is all that now remains. In April, 1998, the Butterfly and Insect House was renamed as South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary, with the introduction of other wildlife. In the latter half of 2005, the South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary was closed and dismantled and an office and retail store were built on the South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary's former location. Also gone from the South Bank Parklands are the canals, bridges and launches.

The original show debuted on CBS, on October 29, 1966, and ran for one season with 20 episodes.The Mighty Heroes at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on February 23, 2016. The stories took place in Good Haven, a fictitious city that was continually beset by various supervillains. When trouble occurred, the city launched a massive fireworks display to summon a quintet of high-flying superheroes into action‚ÄîStrong Man, Rope Man, Tornado Man, Cuckoo Man and Diaper Man. Premise In Act 1 of each episode, the team members were portrayed as accident-prone bunglers. A typical occurrence had them in combat hopelessly tangled together offering each other stock apologies, often while falling en masse until they were captured by the villain. In Act 2, however, having escaped the villain's deathtrap in the cliffhanger, the team always managed to regroup and fight with proper coordination to win the day. Their villains included the Ghost Monster, the Enlarger, the Frog, the Toy Man, the Shocker, the Shrinker and the Scarecrow. Production The cartoons originally appeared as a segment of the long-running Mighty Mouse Playhouse during the 1966-67 season, which was renamed Mighty Mouse and The Mighty Heroes in recognition of the new segment. Some weeks during the network run, two complete Mighty Heroes segments would open and close the show with a classic Mighty Mouse cartoon in-between. In other weeks, one Mighty Heroes episode would be split in two to open and close the show, with two Mighty Mouse cartoons broadcast in-between. The character voices were provided by Herschel Bernardi, who provided all voices of Strong Man, Diaper Man, and Tornado Man, and Lionel Wilson, who provided Cuckoo Man and Rope Man. Bernardi was also the original provider of the \\"Ho Ho Ho\\" voice of the Jolly Green Giant and of StarKist's Charlie the Tuna's voice in commercials. Wilson was also the voice of the title character in another famous Terrytoons series, Tom Terrific. Only 20 episodes were produced; the series came to an end when Bakshi left Terrytoons in 1967. Post first-run syndication Reruns of The Mighty Heroes were eventually syndicated by Viacom (now CBS Television Distribution) in the 1970s as part of the Mighty Mouse package. There have also been two licensed VHS releases. Ten Mighty Heroes theatrical shorts also appeared in movie theaters between 1969 and 1971. They appeared in animated form as guest stars in the episode \\"Heroes and Zeroes\\" of the late 1980s series Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, produced by Bakshi, in which they had all retired and were running the accounting firm of Man, Man, Man, Man and Man. Even Diaper Man had grown up, evidenced by his wearing a mustache. They were in included in the 1999 Terrytoons pilot Curbside.https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/101602-Curbside Comic books There are three comic book adaptations of The Mighty Heroes. The first series was published by Dell Comics in 1967 and ran for four issues. The second series was published by Spotlight Comics in 1987 and ran for one issue. The third series was published by Marvel Comics in 1998 and also ran for one issue. Characters All five of the Mighty Heroes had the power to fly. Individually, they were: * Strong Man has super strength. He speaks with a friendly farm-boy type of accent and holds a civilian job as a mechanic. His favorite fighting move is his \\"jet-propelled blow\\" by which he flies into a villain fist-first. * Rope Man is a sailor who works at the docks. Erudite with a British accent, he can transform into a seemingly unending length of rope. He can use his hands like lassos, and can even weave himself into a net. The drawbacks to his powers are that he frequently gets tangled up or knotted, more often than not around his own teammates. * Tornado Man is a television weather forecaster who can spin himself into a tornado. He often sucks the villains into his vortex, then shoots them out toward the nearest wall. He speaks in a wheezy voice. * Cuckoo Man is a bird-shop owner whose powers are the most limited of the group. Unlike the other heroes, who can fly with no effort, Cuckoo Man has to flap his arms almost constantly in order to keep aloft (the conclusion of every episode always shows him lagging behind the others as they fly off into the distance). Cuckoo Man changes into his costume by jumping up through the bottom of his store's cuckoo clock and popping out through the little door. While the other heroes' flying is accompanied by a \\"jet\\" sound effect similar to Mighty Mouse's, Cuckoo Man's is represented by a chugging jalopy-engine sound. * Diaper Man is a red-headed, diapered, yet fully articulate baby as well as the leader of the group, who sounds a lot like Popeye the Sailor Man. His main weapon is his bottle, which by holding on to the rubber nipple, he can swing around (or shoot like a slingshot) forcefully. The bottle can also shoot high pressure streams of baby formula. In emergencies, Diaper Man (and often Strong Man) will drink some formula from the bottle when extra strength is needed. Episodes Almost all of the 20 episodes were named after the enemies the Mighty Heroes encountered in each. { class=wikitable style=\\"background:white\\" - style=\\"color:white\\" ! style=\\"background:#B0171F; width:20px\\" N¬∫ ! style=\\"background:#B0171F\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#B0171F; width:130px\\" Air date } Although some sources list \\"The Proton Pulsator\\" as a 21st episode, this was actually an episode of The Astronut Show.

The village is situated approximately east of Kingston upon Hull. Geography Main Street, Paull village (2007) The western part of the civil parish of Paull centred on the village of Paull on the banks of the Humber Estuary and is bounded by the Hedon Haven watercourse to the west and north, and the Humber Estuary to the south; the north-eastern boundary of the parish is coincident with the Newton Garth, Haylands, Green's, Riggs, and South Ends & Thorney drains; the parish extends approximately south-east along the bank on a strip approximately wide and from Paull bordered to the north by the Sands and Keyingham drains, and the 'Old Channel', with the Ottringham Drain at the eastern boundary. To the north and west are the town of Hedon and the Salt End refinery and chemical works in the parish of Hedon. The other bounding parishes from west to east are Thorngumbald, Keyingham, Ottringham and Sunk Island.Ordnance Survey 1:25000 2006 The land in the civil parish is in agricultural use, and is low lying, mostly below above sea level, and extensively drained by canals and ditches. There are minor rises north and east of Paull at Rose Hill, Boreas Hill, and Holme Hill were the altitude reaches approximately ; there is a similar rise at the Paull battery, adjacent south-east of Paull. Along the Humber banks are extensive tidal mud flats. According to the 2011 UK census, Paull parish had a population of 723, a decrease on the 2001 UK census figure of 765. The banks of the Humber require flood defences, with all of the parish within the floodplain of the Humber Estuary. As of 2008 the flood defences are thought to be in good condition, with standard of protection is estimate to be to a 1 in 80 or 1 in 100 years flood event. At Paull Holme Strays the flood protection banks have been cut (2004) to form an tidal mud flat based nature reserve. There are historic structures at Paull battery (now a museum Fort Paull) and Paull Holme Tower. =Paull village= Paull village is the only habitation of significance in the parish, excluding farms. Paull village is accessed via a road off the A1033. Paull village includes a church, lighthouse, three pubs (The Royal Oak, Humber Tavern and Crown Inn), and a school. Paull also had a small Medium Wave transmitter site from which the signals for BBC Radio Humberside, Absolute Radio and TalkSPORT were transmitted. This was switched off in January 2018, with radio being centred on FM and DAB broadcasts. HistoryVillage= Tug under construction at Hepworth's shipyard (2008) Both Paull (Paghel) are listed in the Domesday Book as places within the Manor of Burstwick. The place is typical of a medieval settlement in Holderness, occupying higher, and better drained ground in an area prone to flooding. In the medieval period there were three settlements: Paull Fleet (archaic Paul- flete, later Low Paull) near the outfall of the Hedon Haven onto Humber; Up Paull (or Over Paull, later High Paull); and Paull Holme. Paull Fleet and Up/Over Paull merged into a single village Paull in the 16th century. There was a shipyard at Paull located between High Paul and Paul, took advantage of the sloping beach at that position as a good place for launching ships. The yard built some ships for the Royal Navy: between 1739 and 1774 three warships were built, Thomas Steemson owned the shipyard in the early 19th century; ships of up to 74 guns were built, including of 1812. By the 1830s it was no longer active.Also . Steemson also had a yard at Thorne, a list of ships built by Steemson for the Royal Navy at both yards is given in: Historically Paull was known for shrimp fisheries, in around 1900 the lower part of Hedon Haven (or Paull Creek), and the Humber and Paull roads were access for a numerous fleet of small and medium-sized boats known as 'Paull Shrimpers'; the shrimps were caught in the Humber by beam trawling. The population of the Township of Paull rose from 212 in 1801 to 473 in 1831, and to 600 by 1856. The Humber Tavern was built 1805, the Royal Oak was also built in the early 19th century, the Crown Inn opened 1856. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built around 1810 in the village, there was also a Primitive Methodist Chapel, built 1851, then demolished and replaced with another chapel in 1871. A new shipyard, Hepworths Shipyard, opened . In the second half of the 20th century, housing in Paull village expanded, initially along Back Lane/Road in the 1950/60s era; then south of Townend Road in the 1970s on a former Sports ground; and then south of Turpit on the new lane after Ferryman Park towards the end of the century.Ordnance Survey. 1:10560/1:10000 (1956‚Äì1993) In 2013 a new village hall was opened, having received ¬£464,494 in Big Lottery Fund funding. =Church of St Andrew= St Andrew's Church, Paull, north and west side (2007) The early history of churches at Paull is uncertain. states there has been a church at Paull from 1115 AD. Incumbents of the parish of Paull (and Thorngumbald) are recorded as far back as 1295, and burials are recorded to 1347. The present church was built , replacing a church on the banks of the Humber which was in a ruinous state, and subject to floods. Initially dedicated to St Mary from the 15th century it was also dedicated to St Andrew. The church was burnt during the English Civil War at the same time the fort at Paull was attacked (11 October 1642). It was repaired in 1663, and again . In 1841, the church was described consisting of a tower, nave, chancel and north and south transepts, built of stone plus cobbles, with some brick repair work. The tower had a three staged battlemented tower, with pointed windows in the upper (belfry) stage; the nave had two curved and one square headed window on the south side, similar on the north side with three windows and a door; each transept had a large pointed window, Perpendicular in style; the chancel had two windows with a small central door divided by wall buttresses in the south side, and similar buttressing on the north side, but with a window blocked off and a vestry. The buttressing was a mixture of normal, diagonal, and corner buttressing, most of three stages (five at the transepts), with mostly angled buttresses at corners, excluding the west ends of the transepts (single corner), and east end of the chancel (doubled corner). The interior included three sets of octagonal piers in the nave, separating the aisles. The church was restored in 1879, and again . Because the church was neither in Paul Fleet, High Paul, or Paul Home a saying arose: =Fortifications and military works= Aerial view of Paull Point from the south-west, with St Andrew's church (1995) There are records of beacons along the Humber including one at Paull dating to the 16th century, used to give warning of enemy ships or invasion. Paull has been host to coastal defences for centuries. In 1542, as part of a review of coastal defences carried out by Henry VIII to prepare against possible war with France and Spain, a battery for twelve gunners was built at Paull. In the prelude to the First Siege of Hull (July 1642) a fort with cannon was erected at Paull (also at Hessle Cliff) by the Royalist faction in order to control shipping on the Humber, though in mid July around 2,000 soldiers, plus supplies were able to pass the fort without great inconvenience. In September the fort was repaired and another erected near the Trent Falls, again attempting to control the Humber, but were destroyed by Parliamentary ships. In 1807, an earthen battery, Paull Cliff Battery, was erected in consequence of the Napoleonic Wars to house six 24 pounder cannons, with the land summarily purchased. In 1819 after the end of the wars the land of including barracks and buildings was sold by the Board of Ordnance. In the 1860s new defences of the Humber were built, following the decommissioning of the Hull Citadel. A smaller fortification at Stallingborough, Lincolnshire of six guns and a new 19 gun fort at Paull, on the site of the civil war fort were built. The Paull fort held 19 guns, and was constructed as a polygonal fort, with its main face of facing the Humber, with two flanking faces of ‚Äì the defences consisted, from inside out ‚Äì a wall with loopholes, and casemated Caponiers giving flanking fire across a dry ditch; the fort was protected from artillery fire by an earth glacis; and beyond that the sea wall was stockaded. The entrance to the battery was from the landward side, also protected by a loop holed wall. The barracks, and other soldiers buildings were adjacent to the rear wall.See Ordnance Survey Sheet 241SW 1952 edition. The fort was omitted from earlier editions. In the late 1880s a naval mine facility was built, adjacent west of the fort with access to the foreshore for the Humber Division Submarine Miners. The facilities included a pier, and a light railway to carry the mines to the piers. The Paull Point battery was also upgraded during the latter part of the 19th century, receiving two and four breech loading guns, as well as four muzzle loaders ‚Äì the breech loaders which were placed in new concrete emplacements (1894). Electric defence searchlights were installed in 1907. In the early part of the 20th century and First World War the role of the fort was reduced due to the construction of new emplacements nearer to the mouth of the Humber, at Sunk Island and Stallingborough, better able to protect the port of Immingham. During the First World War additional forts and gun emplacements were built at Spurn Point, Kilnsea, Bull Sand Fort and Haile Sand Fort, reducing Paull Point's military importance; however the site was retained as the headquarters for the defence of the Humber. During the Second World War the fort was the site of a ship Degaussing station, as well as being used as an ammunition store. Military use ended in 1956, and the site was sold in 1960/1. Also in the near environs of the Paull Point installation were practice batteries south of the fort dating from the First World War, and 19th century, as well as a large warehouse, formerly a Second World War ammunition store. During the Second World War decoys intended to represent features of the city of Hull with the intention to mislead Luftwaffe bombers were built around south-east of Hull at 1/3rd scale. The decoys included representations of the docks east of the River Hull (Victoria, Alexandra and King George V Docks), as well as the River Hull and Holderness Drain, with pole mounted lights shining on shallow concrete ponds to simulate reflections from the water of the docks and waterways. Other decoys included oil filled trenches that would be ignited to simulate an oil refinery (i.e. Salt End) under attack, and area were controlled fires were lit to simulate an area under aerial attack. There were further similar decoys in the Holderness and North Lincolnshire areas. There were also heavy anti-aircraft batteries located in the Paull area during the Second World War. Post-Second World War military structures included a nuclear attack monitoring post on Holme Hill (Royal Observer Corps), used from 1962 to 1968. =Other places and features=Paull Holme Paull Holme Tower Paull Holme (Holm) was also listed in the Domesday report, also in the Manor of Burstwick. The family of Holme held the place from the post Conquest period onwards, up to the 18th century when the estate passed to the Torre family through marriage to the female line of Holme. In 1377 the population was around 100. There was once a manor house at Paull Holme. From remains of the foundations it is inferred to have been H-shaped; by 1840 only the north tower was still standing. A number of heraldic elements were present in the fabric, showing the connection to the Holme family, and, from rose emblems in the stone work, suggesting a date after Henry VII. (see Tudor rose.) The remaining tower is of brick, approximately high, in three storeys, with internal space of approximately each. The first floor was supported on a brick vault. It is thought the remainder of the structure would have included brick and timber framed construction.A drawing of 1816 shows the towe with an adjacent wood framed house. The building was restored in 1871 for use as a gazebo with stone window surrounds added, replacing brick. As of 2010 the tower was roofless and in a ruinous condition. The building is located on a formerly moated area. Some repair work was undertaken in 2014. There was also a chapel in Paull Holme. Documentary evidence points to the chapel being in use at the beginning of the 16th century. By the end of the 16th century Paull Holme had become abandoned. The chapel was described as dilapidated by the time of Queen Anne (early 18th century). A newer house was built in 1837 at the foot of the hill at Paull Home. Houses Boreas Hall (2007) A hospital was established at Newton Garth east of Paul by William le Gros in the reign of Henry II. Originally intended for Lepers, non-Lepers were admitted after 1335. The hospital was suppressed by the Abolition of Chantries Act of 1547, in the reign of Henry VIII. A house at Boreas Hill (archaic Boar House, Bower House Hill) dates to at least 1670. The present house is thought to date from the around the first half of the 1700s, with additions in 1936. In 1769 High Paul and the manor of Paghil was acquired from the Constable family by Benjamin Blaydes, merchant and shipbuilder of Hull, for ¬£6,700. A high status dwelling was built, \\"High Paull House\\". The house and estate of was sold to the War Department , and used to build the coastal defence fort \\"Paull Point\\"; the house was retained for military accommodation, stores and offices until the 1950s; the buildings were demolished in the 1950s and 60s, excluding a gatekeepers lodge. There are also listed buildings at Thorney Crofts (18th- century farmhouse), and Old Little Humber Farm (17th-century farmhouse on the site of a medieval moated area). =Transportation= The early medieval period the Counts of Aumale owned the ferry from Paul Fleet;Destinations of Barrow and Skitter (Skitter Beck, East Halton) are mentioned in . in 1260 the ferry recorded a profit of 45s 3d; Paul Fleet was also a haven for boats in the same era. A pier was noted at Paull in the 1840s. There was a wooden swing bridge across the Hedon Haven near to Pollard Clough on the far bank in the 1850s; this was no longer extant by the 20th century. By the 1920s a footbridge close to the outfall of the Hedon stream had been built, crossing to Salt End; by the second half of the century the footbridge was no long extant, but a road had been built (Paull Road) running roughly north-west, with a bridge crossing over the haven, and joining the main Hull to Hedon road north of Salt End.Ordnance Survey Sheet 241, 241NW (1850‚Äì1950) The bridge over the Hedon Haven was a lifting bridge,Ordnance survey 1:2500 1969 Image replaced by a concrete deck fixed bridge in the late 20th century. In 1967, an airfield was opened near to Oxgoddes farm, spearheaded by Neville Medforth of the East Yorkshire Aero Company. The airfield had a runway, and was used by the Hull Aero Club. Bristow Helicopters also used the site from 1969 to service North Sea oil rigs, and short haul operator Humber Airways from 1970 to its cessation of business in 1975. In around 1982 the airfield closed. Lighthouses and beacons In 1836 Hull Trinity House built a lighthouse at Paull, then between the shipyard and town. Lit by oil lamps, initially it displayed a fixed white light; in 1852 a red sector was added to help guide vessels around the nearby Skitter sandbank. In 1870 Paull lighthouse was replaced by two sets of leading lights: one at Thorngumbald Clough and the other at Salt End. Thorngumbald Clough Low Light is constructed of a wrought iron frame approximately high on a high brick and flagstone base, the Thorngumbald Clough High light is of a similar design; the low light is painted white, the high light red. The low light was originally on a trolley, enabling it to move up to so as to adjust to changes in the shipping channel. The Thorngumbald lights ceased operation , but were restarted in 1952. As of 2015 both lights are still in use (owned and operated by Associated British Ports, Hull). Both are Grade II listed structures. The pair of lights at Salt End, the other side of Paull, were of near identical design and colour to those at Thorngumbald. They were dismantled in the 1960s when the BP oil terminal at Salt End was being expanded. There was also a lifeboat station in between High and Low Paul, established and closed 1920.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 (1890‚Äì1929) =Land reclamation, drainage and flooding= Cherry Cobb Sands (2006) The earliest record of a sea wall in the area was at Paull Holme in 1201. The position of the Humber coastline has been relatively fluid over several centuries due to flooding, storms, silting, human intervention, and the condition of Spurn Point. In the 17th century the bank of the Humber east of Paull was much further north; Cherry Cobb was a sand bank separated from the Holderness mainland by a navigable channel \\"North Channel\\" of the Humber. From the end of the 17th century to the beginning of the 19th century Cherry Cobb Sands (and Sunk Island to the east) silted up, reducing the north channel. The increased silting was exploited by humans; Cherry Cobb Sands was embanked in 1869/70, closing the north channel to the west. The silting caused drainage problems in the land to the north and Keyingham fleet (or clow) was resited several times in 1730, and again , when it became the jurisdiction of the Keyingham Drainage Authority; silting in the remnant of the north channel reduced the fleet's effectiveness and a new cut of the drain was made, based on one of two designs of Joseph Hodskinson, endorsed by William Chapman in 1797, and enabled by and act of Parliament in 1802. The new cut ran roughly south-east to Stone Creek Clow (the present location of the outlet). By the 1840s the extent of Cherry Cobb Sands represented approximately ; the soil newly reclaimed land was of very good agricultural quality. In the early 2000s the flood defences at Paull Holme Strays were re-aligned backwards to create a tidal lagoon. Construction of the new defences was completed in 2002, and in 2003 the old flood banks were cut, creating a nature reserve. The North Sea tidal surge 2013 caused damage to the defences near Paull; 12 properties were flooded. In 2016, the sea wall through the village was topped with high glass panelling at a cost of ¬£835,000. Creating the longest glass barrier of its kind in Britain at long and designed to protect 14,000 homes.

He is best known for his long run on The Amazing Spider-Man, as well as Arkham Asylum: Living Hell, She- Hulk, Silver Surfer, The Superior Spider-Man, Tony Stark: Iron Man, The Mighty Avengers, Batman Adventures, and Ren & Stimpy. Early life Slott was born in the United States. CareerEarly writing= Dan Slott's first published work for Marvel was \\"Survival of the Hippest\\" in Mighty Mouse #10 and \\"To Bounce Or Not To Bounce\\", an eight-page backup story in New Warriors Annual #1 both cover dated July 1991. He became the regular writer for Marvel's Ren & Stimpy comic book series with that series debut issue (Dec. 1992) and first wrote Spider-Man in an issue of Ren and Stimpy that saw Spider-Man in battle against the Powdered Toast Man. Following this, Slott wrote other children's comics, including DC's Scooby-Doo, Looney Tunes, and Powerpuff Girls. After work on Batman Adventures and Justice League Adventures, Slott was given the chance to pitch a series for DC. The resulting miniseries was Arkham Asylum: Living Hell with artist Ryan Sook in 2003. In 2004 he wrote the \\"4th Parallel\\" storyline for the Justice League which introduced the Red King; this story was published in 2007 in JLA Classified #32‚Äì36. =Marvel Comics= Slott speaking on a panel on comic book writing at the 2009 Brooklyn Book Festival. To Slott's right is Jim McCann, and to his left are Fred Van Lente and Peter David. Arkham Asylum's success led to Slott's return to Marvel in 2004 to launch a new She-Hulk series. The title focused on She-Hulk as a \\"superhuman lawyer\\" in the Marvel Universe. After relaunching in October 2005, the second series met with higher sales, and after tie-ins with crossover storylines \\"Civil War\\" and \\"World War Hulk\\", reached its highest numbers yet. In 2007 Slott left the title with volume 2 #21, and became one of the writers on The Amazing Spider-Man. While She-Hulk was on hiatus in 2005, Slott penned the Spider-Man/Human Torch miniseries, which chronicled the friendship of the two characters over the years, with each issue paying tribute to a different era of Marvel Comics. Slott gave the team the Great Lakes Avengers their first ever solo miniseries in GLA: Misassembled, which featured a character being killed in each issue. He made the first roster changes to the team since its inception by creating a new character, Grasshopper, and reviving an obscure one, Squirrel Girl. During this period, Slott signed an exclusive contract with Marvel. He has since returned to the GLA twice, first with the 2005 GLX-Mas Special, following a name change to the Great Lakes X-Men, and then again in the 2007 Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular with co-writer Fabian Nicieza, to coincide with Marvel's Civil War: The Initiative branding. At the end of 2005, Slott was assigned to write The Thing's first solo series in 20 years. It was not a sales success, and was canceled with issue #8, despite Slott's attempts to rally readers in a campaign he called \\"Pull My Thing.\\" The eight issues have been released in a trade paperback entitled Idol of Millions, which sees the Thing and other heroes fighting deadly roller-coasters and other machines in Arcade's Murderworld. Slott was the writer of Marvel's Avengers: The Initiative,Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 336: \\"Writer Dan Slott along with artist Stefano Caselli created this new series to spotlight the government's training program for newly registered superhuman agents.\\" which launched following the conclusion of the 2006‚Äì07 \\"Civil War\\" storyline. He was one of the four writers of the thrice-monthly The Amazing Spider-Man, a schedule which began in January 2008 following the controversial storyline \\"One More Day\\". His first three issues placed in the top ten highest selling comics for January, with the first issue taking the number two spot that month, selling around 128,000 copies, a 3% jump from the previous month. Slott took over writing duties on The Mighty Avengers after writer Brian Michael Bendis' departure, starting with issue #21 and finishing with issue #36. He wrote the story for the Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions video game which was released in September 2010. In November 2010, Slott took over The Amazing Spider-Man as the sole writer, marking the comic book's change to a twice‚Äìmonthly schedule, beginning with Slott's \\"Big Time\\" storyline.Cowsill \\"2010s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 334: \\"Spidey's adventures were about to take an exciting new direction as Dan Slott became the title's sole writer.\\" Archive requires scrolldown The \\"Big Time\\" storyline ended with The Amazing Spider-Man #700, its final issue. While that issue's story, which involved the switching of Peter Parker's mind with that of Doctor Octopus, and ended with the death of Parker in Doctor Octopus' body and Octopus remaining in Parker's, generated controversy among fans, including death threats for Slott, it won the 2012 Diamond Gem Award for Top Dollar Comic of the Year. The comic book went through five printings, The next month saw the premiere of a new series, The Superior Spider-Man, written by Slott, and featuring the adventures of Spider- Man, now inhabited by the mind of Doctor Octopus. The first issue won the 2013 Diamond Gem Award for Comic Book of the Year Over $3.00. The Superior Spider- Man ended with issue #31, with Peter Parker back as Spider-Man, and lead to a relaunch of The Amazing Spider-Man in April 2014. The first issue of this new version of The Amazing Spider-Man is, according to Diamond Comics Distributors, \\"The Best Selling Comic of the 21st Century.\\" In 2014, in the pages of The Amazing Spider-Man, Slott would go on to write Spider-Verse, a massive Spider-Man event teaming up \\"Every Spider-Man Ever\\". It was the first time that characters like Spider-Ham and the newly created Spider-Gwen would team up with Peter Parker, Miles Morales, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Man 2099, and many other Spider-Men. This story would go on to be adapted as a cartoon mini-series in the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, and then in the Oscar Award- winning film, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Slott and artist Mike Allred launched a new Silver Surfer series in May 2014. In 2016, Slott and Allred's Silver Surfer #11 won the Eisner Award for \\"Best Single Issue of the Year\\". In 2018, Slott finished his ten year-plus run on The Amazing Spider-Man. He wrote his last major storyline, titled Go Down Swinging, from issue #797-800, which detailed Spider-Man fighting a Carnage-bonded Green Goblin. After that, he finished his run with his final issue being #801. After finishing his run on The Amazing Spider-Man, Slott is writing Tony Stark: Iron Man and Fantastic Four. 2018 ended with Slott writing four of the Top 10 selling issues for the entire industry, taking the #2, #4, #8, and #10 spots. In 2020, when Diamond Comics released its list of the Top 100 Best-Selling Comics of the Decade, 9 of the titles were ones written by Slott: Amazing Spider-Man #1 (2014), Amazing Spider-Man #800, Fantastic Four #1 (2018), Amazing Spider-Man #700, Amazing Spider-Man #1 (2015), Amazing Spider-Man #798, Superior Spider-Man #1, Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows #1, and Amazing Spider-Man #799.

Rancho Mission Viejo originated as a series of land grants to John Forster in 1845. The remaining part of Rancho Mission Viejo consists of a nearly nature reserve (The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo) and multiple residential communities slated to open in phases between 2010 and 2030. As of 2017, the Sendero village and the Gavilan senior housing developments have been completed. The larger Esencia village is currently under construction with a K-8 school to be opened in fall of 2018. Sendero Marketplace, a shopping center built as part of the community is also under construction. History The ranch's history can be traced back to 1845 when John (Don Juan) Forster acquired Rancho La Paz and Mission San Juan Capistrano.Spanish and Mexican Ranchos of Orange County Forster added these properties to Rancho Trabuco, which he had purchased in 1843. Forster's brother-in-law was P√≠o Pico, governor of then-Mexican-held California. In 1864, Forster added Rancho Santa Margarita y Las Flores to his holdings, which then totaled about , making him one of the largest landowners in the state. After Forster died in 1882, Irish immigrants Richard O'Neill Sr. and James Flood acquired the ranch, taking equal ownership of the Rancho Santa Margarita y las Flores, Rancho Mission Viejo and Rancho Trabuco lands. Flood provided the money to purchase the ranches; O'Neill, offering his skills as a cattleman as sweat equity, agreed to work out his half as resident manager. Under O'Neill, the cattle herd was expanded, the land was improved, row crops were introduced, and the ranch became Orange County's largest producer of wheat. In 1907, James L. Flood, son of the original owner, made good on his late father's promise and conveyed an undivided half interest to O'Neill, Sr. Four months later, declining health caused O'Neill to deed his interest to his son, Jerome. In 1923, the sons of Flood and O'Neill consolidated their partnership with the Santa Margarita Company. Shortly thereafter, both men died. The Santa Margarita Co. was dissolved in 1939 when the ranch was split in two. Richard O'Neill Jr. retained the portion of the ranch located in Orange County (Rancho Mission Viejo and Rancho Trabuco) and the Flood family took the Rancho Santa Margarita y las Flores property in San Diego County. In 1942, the United States Marine Corps acquired the entire San Diego portion of for $4,239,062 to expand Camp Pendleton. After the war, what remained of the historic Ranch now encompassed two Orange County parcels, united under the name Rancho Mission Viejo, and totaling . O'Neill died in 1943 and his widow, Marguerite, led the family and kept the family business intact. In June 1950, with the establishment of the O'Neill Regional Park, the O'Neill family made the first of thousands of acres of open space dedications to Orange County. Controversy Despite the ranch's intent to be a master planned community, in the 1990s, detractors of the area reported concern over the legal water rights, which led to court challenges. In 2018, multiple residents spoke out about Rancho Mission Viejo's restrictive policy of not allowing lower income apartment dwellers to use the community app, which alerts them of events. Apartment dwellers felt this policy was discriminatory and intended to keep them from attending events, through limiting access to location and event details. In 2019, using social media groups on Facebook, residents banded together to eliminate the plan for the ranch to install cell phone towers (5G) near resident's homes. As of July 2019, compromises on the cell phone towers were still being negotiated. Residential development In 1963, the O'Neill family and its partners established the Mission Viejo Company and embarked on its first residential development, the planned community of Mission Viejo. Marguerite had three grandsons, Anthony Moiso, Jerome Moiso, and Douglas Avery. The oldest, Anthony \\"Tony\\" Moiso, newly graduated from college and fresh out of the U.S. Army, took over operations. In 1972, Mission Viejo Co. and its remaining undeveloped area in Mission Viejo were sold to Philip Morris. The Mission Viejo Company was acquired by Shea Properties in August 1997. After the initial sale, Moiso began managing the remaining of Rancho Mission Viejo, while his brothers Jerome Moiso and Douglas Avery continued to oversee operations as owners. The three brothers and their uncle, Richard O'Neill, have preserved more than of open space and moved forward with additional development of the former Rancho. Rancho Mission Viejo is still a working ranch with 600 head of cattle and has more than of citrus trees, as well as crops of avocados, beans and barley. Rancho Mission Viejo is today home to four master-planned communities: the City of Mission Viejo, City of Rancho Santa Margarita, Las Flores, and Ladera Ranch. In 2000, the O‚ÄôNeill/Avery/Moiso family created a comprehensive open space preservation and land use plan for the remaining 23,000 acres of Rancho Mission Viejohttps://www.ocpublicworks.com/ds/planning/land_dev/docs. In 2004, the Ranch Plan was approved by the Orange County Board of Supervisors. That plan has resulted in the creation of The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo (a nearly 17,000-acre habitat reserve on the Ranch) and the plan for a new community called Rancho Mission Viejo., which celebrated its grand opening in 2013 with the debut of its first community called Sendero. In Fall 2015, the new community of Esencia celebrated the grand opening of its first 12 neighborhoods as well as host of community amenities. In May 2019, Reata Glen a senior living community opened in Rancho Mission Viejo and received its first residents.Senior community Reata Glen opens in Rancho Mission Viejo It is described in the typology of the architectural specificationsKTGY Architecture + Planning Reata Glen Typology as 55+ Service Enriched  Independent Living  Assisted Living  Memory Care  Skilled Nursing  Life Plan Community (CCRC) See (Continuing Care Retirement Communities).

It takes girls aged 11‚Äì18 and boys 16-18. To attend this school, all students must have scored highly in the Eleven plus exam. Admissions To be accepted into the school, pupils must currently take the Eleven plus exam. Candidates who live in Rugby must come in the top 120 girls and candidates who live in the wider catchment area (10 miles from the rugby water tower) must come within the top 60. It caters purely for female students from Year 7 - 13 and as of the start of the 2018 Academic Year takes boys Year 12 - 13. This was in response to competing school Lawrence Sheriff accepting both male and female students into their sixth form. In the 11-16 age range, the school has a four-form intake. Each year group numbers roughly 120 girls. At post 16, pupils from many other schools join the current pupils at Rugby High School to create a year group that is around double the size of 11-16 year groups. HistoryOlive Hands= Olive Hands was born in Rugby. After attending the University of London, she became a teacher at a school in Bromyard. She decided, at the age of 27, that girls of Rugby should be given the opportunity for a first class education. She borrowed money to set up a private school in 1903 in adjoining houses at 10 and 12 Elsee Road. It was named the Arnold High School. Later a preparatory department for younger girls was opened and this had 50 pupils by 1910. By 1909 the school had been expanded by linking it to 12 Elsee Road and there were a total of 114 pupils. By 1914 the preparatory department had moved to Eastfield House (now the Masonic Hall ). In 1916 there were 91 pupils in each half of the school. =The County School= The 1918 Education Act gave the county council responsibility for secondary education. In 1919 the W.C.C. was in the process of buying the Clifton Road site when Miss Hands decided she had to close her school. This was the only girls school in Rugby with moderate fees so the council decided it had to take over. In 1919 Miss M.M. Skues was appointed as the first council headmistress. There were 195 girls on the roll and the Elsee Road houses could hold 130. In 1921 the Clifton Road site came into use as the school playing field, replacing a rented field in Bilton Road. In 1926 Miss Skues retired and Miss Glenday took over 140 pupils in the upper school and 40 in the lower. =Rugby High School for Girls - Clifton Road= The foundation stone was laid on 2 October 1924 and the upper school moved in for the Autumn term 1927, when 'Arnold' was dropped from the name. At this point only the main assembly hall and the East quadrangle had been built and was not really large enough for the 168 girls using it. Building of the West quadrangle did not start until 1931 and was finished for September 1932. There was now room for the Preparatory department to move to the new site from Eastfield House. When Miss Glenday left in 1933 there were 300 pupils and 19 teachers at Clifton Road. The new headmistress was Miss Briselden. In 1944 the Education Act prompted the closing of the Preparatory Department. There was no 5 year old entry that year and in 1949 the last year of girls reached 11. The spare space let the upper school increase its intake to 3 forms per year from 1944. In 1955 Miss D.M. Lindsley became headmistress and a month later it was announced that the school was going to move sites again. The Technical College was being split to form an Engineering College and a College of Further Education. The latter college was to take over the school buildings. The High School moved to its present buildings in Longrood Road in Sept 1960.  Houses  The school introduced a house system during the academic year 2000-2001. The houses are named after Sue Ryder, a charitable woman, Barbara Hepworth, a modern artist and Helen Sharman, the first Briton to enter space - the initials of which stand for RHS (Rugby High School), the shorter name for the school, commonly spoken by students. From September 2013 a fourth house was introduced named after Evelyn Glennie, an inspirational woman who was voted for by students. The initial of 'G' stands for the 'Girls' in 'Rugby High School for Girls'. The houses are assigned to whole form groups, and they can gain house points by taking part in various school events, such as the annual Sports Day, interform sports, or Pink Day (in support of Cancer Research UK). Each form is given the initial of their house, to come before the initial of their form tutor, e.g. 8R, is a Year 8 form, in Ryder House. The system is not very different from the interform system previously in place, with girls in the same form all being placed within the same house. However, the house system has created a link between different year groups and has encouraged wider participation in school events other than the interform. The original houses, in use at least up to 1979, were named after Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl, Charlotte Bront√´/Emily Bront√´/Anne Bront√´, Edith Cavell, Marie Curie, Florence Nightingale and Queen Margaret . These were all named after strong women. Each form had some members of each house. There were inter-house sports competitions and a music competition. House points were awarded for consistently good work in a particular subject - three A's in a row as well as mentions on a termly sheet. These could be negative (unsatisfactory) as well as several grades of positive. The points were totalled and a shield awarded. The school also has a 6th Form Entertainment, produced by the year 13 students - sometimes with assistance from the staff - at the end of the Autumn term. This tradition was suspended for several years after a script was deemed to be offensive to members of the staff. It was resurrected in The academic year 2004-2005, with greater involvement and participation from the staff. The new format the entertainment took was of a variety show, with music and dancing displays, followed by a panto-like skit. The skit is often based around a famous story or event, but with students playing the roles of teachers. Previous years included Cinderella (1999), Big Brother (2000), The Wizard of Oz (2001) and The Sound of Music (2005). Each Christmas, there is also a Decorated Classrooms competition, where students take a theme and decorate their classrooms, often acting out performances while being judged. Uniform The school uniform was changed in September 2011. The previous uniform was, for years 7-9, a pale blue polo shirt with a navy blue sweatshirt and navy blue trousers/skirt, for years 10-11 a white or pale blue shirt with a navy blue V-Neck jumper and navy blue trousers/skirt and for Sixth form, office dress. The new uniform consists of a navy blue blazer with navy blue trousers/skirt and navy blue V-neck jumper or tank top. Years 7-9 should wear a pale blue shirt and years 10-11 should wear a white shirt with blue stripes. From September 2013, there will be a new sixth form uniform. Students should wear matching trousers/skirt with a matching jacket in a suit style with any smart shirt of their choice. Also, after Summer 2016, there will be a new PE- Kit consisting of blue and House colours. Ryder is yellow, Hepworth is Red, Sharman is Green and Glennie is Purple From September 2017, there is a change to the blazers, changing the crest from the previous logo (RHS in a circle) to the new one (a lime green 'R' with Rugby High School Written below in white). These new blazers are 'Eco' blazers made from recycled plastic bottles Old Girls' Society The Old Girls‚Äô Society was formed in October 1922. In addition to the summer reunions, there was a flourishing Old Girls Dramatic Society, and a Hockey Club. For several years, an Old Girls‚Äô Dance was held at Christmas time but support for these events eventually dwindled and so from 1959 until 1963, the Society ceased to exist. When it was revived in 1963, Cheese and Wine parties, theatre parties and Coffee evenings were organized to attract members, for many members of the Old Girls lived in Rugby. Each year, money was raised for charities including the Margery Fry Trust for ex- prisoners, Lifeline, Multiple Sclerosis Society, Schizophrenia Society, the Hoskyn Centre and other charities. The Society presented a music stool and engraved outdoor seat to mark the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of the school in 1979. Church services have taken place on the special anniversaries of the school and trees have been planted at the school. Funds were raised by the Old Girls to buy a table and chair for the platform in the School Hall in memory of Miss Briselden (a former Headmistress) after her death in 1992. The Society also raised funds towards the ¬£2000 needed to help provide furnishings and musical equipment for the Alexander Youngman Music Centre. Shirley Wallbank has provided musical entertainment for the reunion on several occasions and Pat Petrie wrote a play portraying her schooldays (1949-1954). There was no shortage of Old Girls then to dress up in the navy tunics, square-necked blouses and the pudding basin hats that they hated when at school! The biggest Fund raising was to restore the tiled Art Deco panel which had been rescued from the Clifton Road school just before it was demolished in 1995. The panel showing Joan of Arc can now be found on the foyer wall at the Rugby Library. At present, the Society meets for the annual reunion in May at Rugby High School.

Mother Goose & Grimm) is an internationally syndicated comic strip by cartoonist Mike Peters of the Dayton Daily News. It was first syndicated starting October 1, 1984, and is distributed by King Features Syndicate to 500 newspapers. Peters received the National Cartoonists Society's 1991 Reuben Award for the strip as well as a nomination for its Newspaper Comic Strip Award for 2000. Characters and story The strip revolves around a yellow bull terrier named Grimm, owned by an anthropomorphic goose named Mother Goose, along with a dimwitted Boston terrier named Ralph and a cat named Attila. The strip is noted for its references to popular culture or recent news that are often spoofed and referenced for a certain period of time, depending on the length of the hype devoted to a certain news story or topic, e.g. Grimm's creation of a website known as \\"GrimmyLeaks\\", which was devoted to publishing rumors relating to fellow comic strip characters, in reference to the controversy surrounding the scandalous website WikiLeaks. The comic strip also makes multiple references to iconic fictional characters including Mr. Potato Head, Superman, Batman, and more, along with popular products including Amazon Kindles. The strip also often consists of stand-alone one-panel comics that do not relate to the continuing story or characters. The comic strip is named after the nursery rhyme collection Mother Goose and the fairytale collection Brothers Grimm.

The voice performers included Charlie Brill as Grimmy, Mitzi McCall as Mother Goose, and Greg Burson as Attila. The show is often shown in syndication. Cameo appearances Grimmy made a couple of appearances on the CGI animated film, Garfield Gets Real. His first appearance was in the cafeteria scene, when Odie jumps on the table that Grimmy's sitting at. His second one was when he was drinking out of the water fountain near the auditorium, in which he sees a poodle and immediately falls in love, drops the water on his head and follows the poodle. He later appeared again in another cafeteria scene in which everyone is thinking of an idea in which to bring Garfield and Odie to come back to Cartoonworld. He appeared again in the men's bathroom drinking out of the toilet, and is immediately embarrassed. This was similar to Dagwood's scene in which he is taking a bath. His final appearance was when everybody is cheering that they had brought back Garfield from the real world, in which he is in a crowd cheering. He did not appear in the sequels, Garfield's Fun Fest and Garfield's Pet Force. Grimmy also made an appearance as a pair of slippers in the Garfield and Friends segment, The Name Game, with his ears excluded. ReferencesSources *Strickler, Dave.

He was born in Sydney, Australia, grew up in Brisbane, and lived in the United Kingdom from the fifties into the seventies. Biography David was the top student in Queensland for both primary and secondary schooling. He achieved a Lilley Memorial Medal in 1945, was the top boy in the Junior examination in 1947, and then top student in the State's Senior examination in 1949. His family lived in the suburb of St Lucia, Queensland where he attended Ironsides State School, and then Brisbane State High School, where he was dux. In Nucleoethics he admitted that despite such success, he did not recall \\"a golden childhood\\" and was \\"immensely relieved to outgrow my youthful fears and persecutors\\". David was an only child, and says he had few close friends. David describes his parents as of Anglican and Methodist origins, but they briefly associated with the Plymouth Brethren after he had been attending one of their Sunday schools. A grandmother turned Seventh-day Adventist. But his parents drifted back via Baptists and Church of Christ to the Methodists, although there were some evangelical and \\"American hot-gospelling rallies\\" along the way. David liked the Methodists who \\"wore their religion lightly\\". Then, \\"after a period in the ideological wilderness, I entered the infidel movement\\".Nucleoethics: Ethics in Modern Society (1972). London: MacGibbon and Kee. p. 14-15 After achieving various bursaries and fellowships he studied medicine at the University of Queensland. Here he edited Trephine, the annual magazine of the University's Medical Society, and demonstrated talent as a singer and actor - appearing in No√´l Coward's Blithe Spirit (play) in 1953. He represented the State several times in the University debating competition. He also enjoyed painting. He had early literary aspirations, filing for copyright in 1954 a work entitled Harem by Installments (The Autobiography of Al B Manleigh Jnr) - which does not seem to have ever been published.National Archives of Australia NAA: A1336, 54191 Despite his academic success, and after having wished to be a doctor since primary school, David found he did not enjoy hospital and medical work. He chose not to qualify as a doctor, and left Australia for Britain some time soon after 1954 to pursue a literary career.President Charles Bradlaugh, MP (1971). London: Elek Books - rear dust jacket He worked in various jobs as a sketch artist, public relations officer, and journalist and became a lecturer in liberal studies, English language and literature, British life and institutions, journalism and humanism.President Charles Bradlaugh, MP (1971). London: Elek Books - rear dust jacket In Britain, David Tribe was chair of Humanist Group Action (1961-1964), President of the National Secular Society (1963-1971), editor of The Freethinker (1966). He was also an executive committee member of the National Council for Civil Liberties (1961-1972).President Charles Bradlaugh, MP (1971). London: Elek Books - rear dust jacket A close ally in the National Secular Society, Bill McIlroy, commented on his work there: \\"Although he has never been popular with those in the movement who are ready to compromise with opponents before the first shot has been fired, David Tribe enjoys the respect and support of people who value clear thinking, plain speaking and a respect for principles.\\" During his time at the National Secular Society he was particularly concerned with the problem of religion in schools. Another member, Denis Cobell, who later became President of the society, recalled David as a powerful orator and debater, who would harangue other speakers, at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park, and Conway Hall, right back to the late fifties. David Tribe closely observed any groups with which he became involved. He saw selfish and sinful behaviours among the religious groups, and turned an equally stern eye on the secular groups he made his home in. In Nucleoethics in 1972 he observed: \\"In so far as there were no creeds, dietary and other tabus there was less occasion for humbug. I did, however, find that there were some humanists ... who thought ... about 'changed lives' as a result of some new humanist insight into living. What precisely this was I was never, despite involvement in the centre of humanist affairs, able to find out. I happened to find a materialist interpretation of the world more plausible and a libertarian attitude to sex and other appetites more congenial than the one I was brought up in (perhaps I was never really 'saved'), but I was unable to see that in everyday matters of tolerance, balanced judgement, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and the rest humanists were any better than anyone else\\".Nucleoethics: Ethics in Modern Society (1972). London: MacGibbon and Kee. p.16 David returned to Australia in 1972 to look after his terminally ill father, William Harold Tribe. He continued to contribute to secularist, rationalist and humanist organisations, but did not again hold office-bearer roles. From 1973 to 1987 he worked in the NSW Public Service on publicity, public relations and policy most notably in environmental protection and recycling. His years of work on environmental policy did not prevent him later entering debate in humanist journals expressing doubt regarding anthropogenic global warming and climate change (AGWCC) stating in 2013: \\"if scientific consensuses have political and commercial consequences, entire populations can be adversely affected. AGWCC is very complex. Whether it turns out to be 'absolute crap' or 'the greatest moral challenge of our time' seems unlikely to be settled in my lifetime\\".Australian Humanist No.111 Spring 2013 p.17 David Tribe had already expressed stern observations on scientists in Nucleoethics. \\"Now it seemed to me that in science ... even more than in the arts the great bulk of people ... were chasing a meal-ticket or social status rather than quenching any passionate search for knowledge. ... Within the rigours of their own disciplines, trendiness, deference to authority, purblind commitment to pet theories, however discredited, wilfulness, jealousy and One-up-manship were more noticeable than outsiders imagine. Outside their professional competence, they showed no greater resistance than non-scientists to mythology, ancient or modern ... and no less tendency to 'irrationalism' in everyday life. Even when their professional researches were models of objectivity and humility, these did not necessarily spill over into their private lives and influence their moral judgements\\".Nucleoethics: Ethics in Modern Society (1972). London: MacGibbon and Kee. p. 16-17 In 2001, David Tribe became an honorary associate of Rationalist International. In 2005 he put $300,000 into a foundation to establish the University of Sydney's \\"David Harold Tribe Awards\\" in fiction, poetry, philosophy, sculpture, and symphony.Sydney Alumni Gazette April 2005 In May 2017, severe illness placed him in Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital, from where he was sent to Montana Nursing Home in the nearby suburb of Mosman. On Tuesday the 30th of May, he woke and enjoyed a supper, but was found peacefully deceased later that evening.

A man who was strong and powerful in stature but shy and unassuming in character, the foundations of Quinn's enduring fame were laid with a hat-trick in the 1902 British League Cup final against Old Firm rivals Rangers,Coronation Cup Tie Final, Dundee Evening Telegraph, 18 June 1902, via The Celtic WikiThe British League Cup 1902, Before The 'D'...Association Football around the world, 1863-1937, 11 November 2015 and cemented in the 1904 Scottish Cup Final against the same opposition. At half-time Rangers led by two goals to nil. In the second half, however, Celtic came back to win 3‚Äì2, Quinn scoring all the goals. This was the second hat-trick in a Scottish Cup Final; it was 68 years before the feat was repeated by Dixie Deans in Celtic's 6‚Äì1 defeat of Hibs in 1972. That cup final hat-trick was the first a Celtic player scored against Rangers in a major competition, and Quinn also scored the second, in a 3‚Äì0 league victory on New Year's Day 1912. He was the only player from either side to have twice scored a hat-trick in an Old Firm match until Ally McCoist emulated him in the 1980s. 1908 Celtic team photo with the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup, Scottish Cup and Glasgow Cup trophies; Quinn is bottom row, second from right Quinn won six successive championship and five Scottish Cup medals with Celtic as the focal point of a forward line which became well known across the country: Bennett, McMenemy, Quinn, Somers and Hamilton. He scored 218 goals in 331 appearances in the two major competitions ‚Äì 188 in the League (273 appearances including a playoff in 1905) and 30 in the Scottish Cup from 58 appearances, eight of them in finals (1904, 1908, 1909, and 1911), plus dozens more in various minor tournaments. His strike rate of 0.65 ‚Äì almost two goals every three games ‚Äì is surpassed among Celtic goalscorers only by Jimmy McGrory, Henrik Larsson and Sandy McMahon. As a scorer of league goals, his total of 187 is behind McGrory alone. Quinn was the first Celtic player to score 200 goals for the club, and only four others have done so-- McGrory, Bobby Lennox (273), Larsson (242), and Stevie Chalmers (228). Ninety years after his retirement, he remains the club's fifth highest goalscorer. He received a benefit match in 1926, in which Celtic played against a Scottish League team, ending in a 3‚Äì3 draw.Celtic, 3; Scottish League Select; 3, Glasgow Herald 19 August 1926 (via Partick Thistle History Archive) His grandson of the same name also played for Celtic. =International= Quinn scored seven goals in 11 appearances for Scotland including four out of five goals against Ireland in 1908, and eight in as many games for the Scottish League XI.

Within a telecoms carrier, an LCR team might periodically (monthly, weekly or even daily) choose between routes from several or even hundreds of carriers for destinations across the world. This function might also be automated by a device or software program known as a least-cost router. Telecoms carriers as suppliers and customers Telecoms carriers often buy and sell call termination services with other carriers. A carrier such as Telewest or France Telecom will be interconnected with other telecoms carriers and might have a number of routing options of different price, quality and capacity to a given country. In the de-regulated EU, these will be licensed alternative operators (e.g. Cable and Wireless / Colt in the UK or Jazztel in Spain) or the (PTT)'s of other countries, such as T-Systems (Germany), Telef√≥nica (Spain), NTT (Japan) or Telstra (Australia), who establish offices or a point of presence (POP) in a major telecommunications hub city such as London, New York, Hong Kong or Amsterdam. The major US carriers, Sprint, Verizon, AT&T; and Level 3 in the US International telecommunications routes also have POPs in these hub cities. There are also niche carriers which specialise in providing termination to a small number of destinations, sometimes through the use of grey routes. \\"Trading\\" in the telecom carrier-carrier market is very different from the \\"trading\\" conducted in financial markets by brokers and banks. Whereas brokers and banks may buy and sell the same stocks or bonds with each other in the same day, carriers have to be very careful not to do so. For example, if carrier A buys USA from carrier B who buys it from A, one call will come in to carrier A, go to B and return to A, continually until all the circuits are taken up with the one call. If it does terminate on an overflow route, the carriers may bill each other many times over for the same call. This is called looping and is very undesirable. Buying ‚Üí costing ‚Üí routing ‚Üí pricing ‚Üí margin management cycle The LCR team in a carrier might follow a cycle: # The buyers negotiate with their suppliers and get a new price schedule. # The prices are loaded into software to calculate and compare termination costs. # A route is chosen, fixing a cost-for-pricing, and new prices are issued based on the costs-for-pricing. # The new routes are implemented on the switch and finally the traffic volumes and margins are monitored through reports from the billing system. # Loss-making traffic and odd routing are investigated, and either the billing system has its data corrected or routing and pricing action is taken. Carriers sign interconnect agreements with each other specifying the terms under which they will do business. Such agreements define terms of payment, methods and procedures of dispute resolution, and the means by which the carriers will notify each other of pricing changes. The industry standard is currently seven days for price increases while price decreases often take effect on the day of notification. Because the margins in the carrier-carrier market are extremely slim, re- routes or price increases must be made quickly to a destination where the current route is going to increase in price. Since the price increase itself has seven days' notice, it must be issued within twenty-four hours of the cost increase to avoid losses. This can put significant pressures on a carrier's LCR team, who must process the offers from their suppliers quickly and accurately. Impact of mobile-number portability in VoIP and LCR environments Mobile number portability impacts the internet telephony, VoIP (Voice over IP) and Least Cost Routing (LCR) businesses. Mobile number portability (MNP) is a service that makes it possible for subscribers to keep their existing mobile phone number when changing the service provider (or mobile operator). With number portability now in place in many countries, LCR providers can no longer rely on using only a portion of the dialed telephone number to route a call. Instead, they now need to discover the actual current network of every number before routing the call. Thus, LCR solutions also need to handle MNP when routing a voice call. In countries without a central database like UK it might be necessary to query the GSM network about the home network a mobile phone number belongs to. MNP checks are important to assure that this quality of service is met; by handling MNP lookups before routing a call and assuring that the voice call will actually work, VoIP companies give businesses the necessary reliability they look for in an internet telephony provider. In countries such as Singapore, the most recent MNP solution is expected to open the doors to new business opportunities for non-traditional telecommunication service providers like wireless broadband providers and VoIP providers. In November 2008 the United States' FCC (Federal Communications Commission) released an order extending number portability obligations to interconnected VoIP providers and carriers that support VoIP providers. Number plan management and analysis Whereas markets in commodities such as pork bellies or oil have agreed definitions and arbitrating bodies for the commodities they trade, the carrier-carrier market has no agreed definitions of its destinations. Every carrier uses the International Telecommunication Union E.164 standard for country codes, but each carrier uses different codes for destinations within a country, usually because it is using different suppliers within that country. So one carrier's codes for Cali may not be the same as another's. This applies especially to mobile operators. While the difference in price between a call to a land-line and a call to a mobile may not seem much at 9 UK pence, the volumes can be one hundred thousand minutes a day or more, leading to losses of over ¬£250,000 a month. When a carrier's dial code table can contain three thousand items, comparing codes is a critical and complex part of the process. The theory of dial code relationships actually involves the mathematical theory of lattices and code comparisons have to be done with computer software. Number plan management monitors changes in suppliers' dial codes and adds or removes codes from the company's own code tables to improve costs. Implementing the changes across the company's switches, billing systems, calling card and other IN platforms is a significant task for the engineering and billing departments. Cherry- picking One aim of LCR teams is to cherry-pick. This happens when Carrier A's team finds that Carrier B defines a code range as being fixed-line and so cheap, while Carrier A defines it as mobile and so more expensive. Carrier A will send that range to Carrier B, pay a low fixed-line rate and charge at a high mobile rate - making much more profit. Carrier B will sustain losses if it does not notice that its supplier, C, also defines that range as belonging to a mobile operator and charges a higher rate. Caught in the middle, B can sustain five- or even six- figure losses in a very short time. Route and call quality The LCR team also has to take route and call quality into account. The quality of route to a destination can vary considerably between suppliers and even from week to week from the same supplier. Quality is usually measured by the Answer-Seizure Ratio (ASR = call attempts answered / call attempts), Post-Dial Delay (PDD) and the Average Call Duration (ACD). If the average call duration is very low, it is taken to mean that the call quality is so poor that people cannot have a conversation and hang up. This matters to calling card operators because people do not re-purchase card services that give a low ACD. In case of significant discrepancies in ACD values across available routes, the carrier shall prioritize the routes offering higher ACD.ACD Routing A low ASR is taken to mean that callers cannot get through to the other end and hence that the route is congested or is of low quality. The low ASR is not as bad as low ACD, because it suggests at least a proper answer supervision (i.e. correct signaling), and therefore the handover mechanism can reroute calls via other available routes. An on-line monitoring system of a quality based routing is publicly available for a demo traffic.ACD monitor Post-dial delayPost dial delay is the time from dialing the last digit to the time a caller hears ringing. Another, more sophisticated way of measuring the call quality is Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ). Such measurements are rarely used in production switching systems, in particular due to the necessity of voice samples at both ends. Additionally, the team may take into account the responsiveness of their supplier's technical team: if there is a fault or low quality, does the supplier fix it or just say that it is the best they can do? LCR software The key tasks LCR software must do are: load prices schedules and code tables automatically; keep control of volume commitment and available capacity; compare dial codes correctly; turn the carriers' name-based price schedule into a dial code- dependent termination cost schedule; put costs in order; incorporate quality considerations; produce costing and routing schedules in a format suitable for pricing analysts and engineering; generate automatic MML orders to the switches; and transfer data into the billing system. LCR software varies from home-grown Excel spreadsheets, through Access and Microsoft Visual Studio applications to commercial products offering integration with the switch and billing systems costing up to ¬£500,000 for an installation. The simpler the software, the more complex the surrounding manual processes. =Routing platforms= With VoIP becoming a predominate carrier messaging system, routing becomes available from stand alone products and hosted services. These services are built on top of the RFC 3261 3XX series messaging, which allows for stateless redirection of call signaling. These stand alone LCR systems integrate many powerful routing features such as: jurisdictional, profit margin protected routing along with standard LCR and offload routing from switching components. Other open source platforms such as OpenSER/Kamailo exist that are capable of performing redirect based routing, they are however less specifically geared toward exploiting the market niches involved in carrier telecommunications routing. Related Ideas Least Cost Routing is also used to describe a type of equipment installed on customers' premises. An LCR box is programmed with prices from the companies supplying telecoms services to that company and the box routes each call to the appropriate supplier.

Hamilton was raised in Topeka, Kansas, where his father was general counsel of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Upon graduation from preparatory school in 1913, he stopped in Chicago to see his father's friend, Dean Wigmore, who promptly invited him to enroll in Northwestern University Law School. Hamilton went on to become Speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives for the 1927 Session and 1928 Special Session. He lost the Republican Governor primary election to Clyde Reed in 1928. In the 1930 Republican Governor primary he was the campaign manager for Frank Hauke who defeated incumbent Governor Clyde Reed, but lost in the general election. As Hauke's campaign manager, Hamilton was also made Chairman of the Kansas Republican Party from 1930 to 1932, In November 1932, following the death of Kansas Republican National Committeeman David Mulvane, Governor Alf Landon had Hamilton elected as the new Kansas Republican National Committeeman for Kansas, a role he filled from 1932 to 1940. In 1936, following the nomination of then-Governor Alf Landon to run against President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mr. Hamilton was appointed chairman of the Republican National Committee. His picture was on Time's cover on September 23, 1936. Landon lost the election in a landslide, but Mr. Hamilton continued as chairman of the Republican National Committee until 1940, due in large part to the considerable help of a freshman Illinois congressman, Everett Dirksen, whose eloquent support turned back several efforts to replace Mr. Hamilton. Mr. Hamilton personally visited 3,000 GOP county chairmen during his four-year term, and, in the process, eliminated the huge Landon campaign debt. Mr. Hamilton presided at the 1940 Republican National Convention that nominated Wendell Willkie to run against Roosevelt. When, according to well-established custom, Willkie picked his own national party chairman, Mr. Hamilton retired from active politics. In 1940, Hamilton at the age of 48 resigned from the RNC and two days later married Jane Kendall Mason, 30, who a month earlier divorced George Grant Mason Jr., member of the Civil Aeronautics Board in Tampa, Florida. According to former first lady Grace Coolidge, Jane Kendall was \\"the most beautiful debutante who ever entered the White House\\". At the urging of members of Philadelphia's Pew family, he came to Philadelphia, rather than return to Kansas, and joined the Pepper firm. Even in private practice, he remained an active and shrewd observer of the political scene. He was a consummate raconteur of political stories, and in the days before timesheets, partners and associates drifted into his office for impromptu gatherings where they heard Hamilton tell tales of political lore. Hamilton received national and international attention in 1950, when he was appointed to represent Harry Gold, a Philadelphia chemist and confessed courier in the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg network that passed atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. In 1955 he became chairman of the Pepper Law Firm and resigned the position in 1964.

He currently presents the Rock FM Breakfast Show.  Career  Early radio presenter = Joel Ross started out in radio as a presenter on his hometown station Yorkshire Coast Radio in 1993, at the age of 16, presenting the evening show and Nothing But the 90's. He left in late 1995 and went on to present various shows on Minster FM, A1FM, Sun City 103.4, TFM Radio and Metro Radio, as well as being a travel presenter for many stations in the North. = JK and Joel = He joined Viking FM in 1996, starting on the nightshift. He worked his way up to the late show, off-air breakfast producer, evening show host and afternoon show presenter. He was then offered the chance to pair up with JK (a long-time colleague and socialising partner) on the breakfast show, which JK had hosted alone for the previous year. Initially, the arrangement was just for Ross to earn some overtime from his afternoon shift by reading JK's travel reports; but instantly it became clear that the pair had a natural broadcasting rapport as well as great ability to communicate with the audience, and so Ross was relieved of his afternoon duties and elevated to the role of breakfast co-host. Together, they won two Gold Sony Radio Academy Awards for 'Breakfast Show Of The Year' and a Silver for 'Entertainment Show'. This success led to the pair working together on many other projects in radio and television, until going their separate ways in 2013. =Other Work= In 2011, Ross became the host of Wrestle Talk TV. Originally a YouTube-based show talking about the recent wrestling action as well as interviews with both WWE and TNA wrestlers. The show debuted on Challenge on 26 August 2012. Ross was fired in March 2014 for making comments on social media which WTTV deemed \\"unacceptable\\". Ross appeared as part of the Channel 4 Racing's Morning Line team on 7 April 2012. In January 2013, Ross joined Heart West Midlands, presenting local weekend shows. He has also covered for Neil 'Roberto' Williams on the networked evening show and the weekday breakfast show in the West Midlands. He joined Heart North West on 6 May 2014 as the station's breakfast show co-host, alongside Lorna Bancroft. He co-hosts The Sun's WrestleCast with journalist Simon 'LilsBoy' Rothstein, interviewing WWE and TNA wrestlers. In 2014, it won AudioWrestling.com's \\"Male Interview Of The Year\\" and \\"Editor's Choice Male Interview Of The Year\\". In 2019, Heart nationalised their Breakfast show which brought an end to Joel and Lorna on Heart North West. Ross became the host of Rock FM's Breakfast Show with Gemma Cutting. Personal life Ross's passions away from radio include the television soap opera Prisoner: Cell Block H, as well as a love for professional wrestling. He is a sports fan, supporter of Manchester United and a horse racing fanatic. His dream is to work in the USA full-time and be involved with wrestling in some writing/broadcasting capacity. Ross shares his birthday with Reggie Yates, the person who succeeded him as the host of The Official Chart.

A sketched figure composition by Rembrandt Charcoal sketch of willows by Thomas Gainsborough A sketch (ultimately from Greek œÉœáŒ≠Œ¥ŒπŒøœÇ ‚Äì schedios, \\"done extempore\\"sketch , on Oxford DictionariesœÉœáŒ≠Œ¥ŒπŒøœÇ , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus) is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work.Diana Davies (editor), Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists, Harrap Books Limited, (1990) A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle. Sketches can be made in any drawing medium. The term is most often applied to graphic work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. It may also apply to drawings executed in pen and ink, digital input such as a digital pen, ballpoint pen, marker pen, water colour and oil paint. The latter two are generally referred to as \\"water colour sketches\\" and \\"oil sketches\\". A sculptor might model three-dimensional sketches in clay, plasticine or wax. Sketching Sketching is generally a prescribed part of the studies of art students. This generally includes making sketches (croquis) from a live model whose pose changes every few minutes. A \\"sketch\\" usually implies a quick and loosely drawn work, while related terms such as study, modello and \\"preparatory drawing\\" usually refer to more finished and careful works to be used as a basis for a final work, often in a different medium, but the distinction is imprecise. Underdrawing is drawing underneath the final work, which may sometimes still be visible, or can be viewed by modern scientific methods such as X-rays. Most visual artists use, to a greater or lesser degree, the sketch as a method of recording or working out ideas. The sketchbooks of some individual artists have become very well known, including those of Leonardo da Vinci and Edgar Degas which have become art objects in their own right, with many pages showing finished studies as well as sketches. The term \\"sketchbook\\" refers to a book of blank paper on which an artist can draw (or has already drawn) sketches. The book might be purchased bound or might comprise loose leaves of sketches assembled or bound together.Cf. Richard Brereton, Sketchbooks: The Hidden Art of Designers, Illustrators & Creatives, Laurence King, repr. ed. 2012. Sketching is also used as a form of communication in areas of product design such as industrial design. It can be used to communicate design intent and is most widely used in ideation It can be used to map out floor plans of homes. The ability to quickly record impressions through sketching has found varied purposes in today's culture. Courtroom sketches record scenes and individuals in law courts. Sketches drawn to help authorities find or identify wanted people are called composite sketches. Street artists in popular tourist areas sketch portraits within minutes.Cf.

E. and Vette, J. I. (1975) OGO Program Summary, NASA SP-7601 of NASA refers to the six satellites launched by the United States that were in use from September 1964 to 1972, designed to study the Earth's magnetosphere. The satellites successfully studied the interactions between the Earth and the Sun, despite a number of technical problems. Each satellite had 20 to 25 instruments. OGO 1, OGO 3, and OGO 5 were in equatorial orbits; OGO 2, OGO 4, and OGO 6 were in lower polar orbits. OGO launch chronology * OGO 1 1964-054A NORAD ID: 00879 Launched: 4 September 1964 On-orbit dry mass: 487 kg (decayed 29 August 2020) * OGO 2 1965-081A NORAD ID: 01620 Launched: 14 October 1965 On-orbit dry mass: 507 kg (decayed 17 September 1981) * OGO 3 1966-049A NORAD ID: 02195 Launched: 7 June 1966 On-orbit dry mass: 515 kg (decayed 14 September 1981) * OGO 4 1967-073A NORAD ID: 02895 Launched: 28 July 1967 On-orbit dry mass: 562 kg (decayed 16 August 1972) * OGO 5 1968-014A NORAD ID: 03138 Launched: 4 March 1968 On-orbit dry mass: 611 kg (decayed 2 July 2011) * OGO 6 1969-051A NORAD ID: 03986 Launched: 5 June 1969 On-orbit dry mass: 632 kg (decayed 12 October 1979) OGO 1 The purpose of the OGO 1 spacecraft, the first of a series of six Orbiting Geophysical Observatories, was to conduct diversified geophysical experiments to obtain a better understanding of the Earth as a planet and to develop and operate a standardized observatory-type satellite. OGO 1 consisted of a main body that was parallelepipedal in form, two solar panels, each with a solar-oriented experiment package (SOEP), two orbital plane experiment packages (OPEP) and six appendages EP-1 through EP-6 supporting the boom experiment packages. One face of the main body was designed to point toward the Earth (+Z axis), and the line connecting the two solar panels (X axis) was intended to be perpendicular to the Earth-Sun-spacecraft plane. The solar panels were able to rotate about the X axis. The OPEPs were mounted on and could rotate about an axis which was parallel to the Z axis and attached to the main body. Due to a boom deployment failure shortly after orbital injection, the spacecraft was put into a permanent spin mode of 5 rpm about the Z axis. This spin axis remained fixed with a declination of about -10 deg and right ascension of about 40 deg at launch. The initial local time of apogee was 2100 h. OGO 1 carried 20 experiments. Twelve of these were particle studies and two were magnetic field studies. In addition, there was one experiment for each of the following types of studies: interplanetary dust, VLF, Lyman-alpha, gegenschein, atmospheric mass, and radio astronomy. Real-time data were transmitted at 1, 8, or 64 kbs depending on the distance of the spacecraft from the Earth. Playback data were tape recorded at 1 kbs and transmitted at 64 kbs. Two wideband transmitters, one feeding into an omnidirectional antenna and the other feeding into a directional antenna, were used to transmit data. A special-purpose telemetry system, feeding into either antenna, was also used to transmit wideband data in real time only. Tracking was accomplished by using radio beacons and a range and range-rate S-band transponder. Because of the boom deployment failure, the best operating mode for the data handling system was the use of one of the wideband transmitters and the directional antenna. All data received from the omnidirectional antenna were noisy. During September 1964, acceptable data were received over 70% of the orbital path. By June 1969, data acquisition was limited to 10% of the orbital path. The spacecraft was placed in a standby status November 25, 1969, and all support was terminated November 1, 1971. By April 1970 the spacecraft perigee had increased to 46,000 km and the inclination had increased to 58.8 deg.  OGO-1 reentry  The University of Arizona‚Äôs Catalina Sky Survey (CSS), funded by NASA‚Äôs Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), detected an object late in the evening of 25 August 2020 which appeared to be on an impact trajectory with Earth. Two Maui middle school students also observed the 250-pound object. Maui Waena Intermediate School eighth-graders Holden Suzuki and Wilson Chau, with mentor outreach astronomer J.D. Armstrong of the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy (IfA), used data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) Faulkes Telescope North on Haleakala to track OGO-1. The University of Hawaii‚Äôs Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), also funded by PDCO, independently observed the object. Further observations were conducted by CSS to confirm the object‚Äôs trajectory. Precision orbit calculations were conducted by the Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies (CNEOS) at NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and compared to data from the European Space Agency‚Äôs NEO Coordination Center. The object was confirmed to be not an asteroid, but in fact Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-1 (OGO-1). OGO-1 reentered Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and disintegrated on Saturday evening, 29 August 2020 over Southern French Polynesia. Video of reentry Non-Earth observations In 1970 OGO-5 used its ultraviolet photometer to observe comets Encke, Tago-Sato-Kosaka (1969 IX) and Bennett (1970 II).

Born in Brooklyn, New York, McDermott graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1919 with a mechanical engineering degree. Early career Upon graduation, McDermott began working for the Goodyear Rubber Company. In 1923, he began employment with Western Electric Company where he first met J. Clarence Karcher. This experience inspired in McDermott a desire for graduate studies. Earlier Everette Lee DeGolyer, vice president and general manager of Amerada Petroleum Corporation of Dallas, had learned of Karcher's 1921 experiments with the seismograph and held a meeting with Karcher that resulted in the creation of Geophysical Research Corporation (GRC) of Tulsa where Karcher was made vice president. This was as a subsidiary of Amerada. McDermott received a Master of Arts in physics from Columbia University in 1925 and immediately began to work for his friend Karcher. GRC introduced the seismic reflection method which was quickly accepted by the petroleum industry as a promising new tool during the next five years. Geophysical Service In 1930, with the backing of DeGolyer, now president of Amerada, Karcher and McDermott launched Geophysical Service, a pioneering provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry with Karcher serving as president and McDermott as vice-president. McDermott's early work in petroleum exploration led to multiple papers and five patents. During the first year of operation McDermott hired Cecil H. Green. These two would have a lasting relationship for the next 43 years. In 1939 the company reorganized as Coronado Corp., an oil company with Geophysical Service Inc (GSI), now as a subsidiary. On December 6, 1941, McDermott along with three other GSI employees, J. Erik Jonsson, Cecil H. Green, and H.B. Peacock purchased GSI, During World War II, GSI built electronics for the United States Army Signal Corps and the Navy. After the war GSI continued to produce electronics. The rugged nature of equipment for the oil industry and of military equipment were similar and thus continued expansion into military contracts was a natural progression. In November 1945 Patrick E. Haggerty joined GSI. Texas Instruments In 1951, McDermott, along with Cecil Howard Green, Patrick E. Haggerty, and J. Erik Jonsson co-founded Texas Instruments. This was done when the company changed its name to Texas Instruments; GSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company. This acknowledged that the company had changed its focus from one primarily devoted to oil exploration to one focused on manufacturing. McDermott was the Chairman of TI from 1951-1957, Chairman of the Executive Committee of Board of Directors from 1957-1964 and Director until his death in 1973. During this period of time, Texas Instruments rose to be one of the world's largest corporations. Philanthropy A scientist and businessman, McDermott was particularly interested in improving education, which he called \\"biological humanics.\\" Along with Cecil Green, he was a co-founder of St. Mark's School of Texas in 1950; their endowment included the donation of a planetarium, observatory, and math-science quadrangle. He was also a major donor to many universities and served on the boards of Southern Methodist University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. He also co- founded the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest in 1961, which became the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) in 1969. In 2001, his wife Margaret endowed the Eugene McDermott Scholars Program at UTD.Eugene McDermott Scholars Program The couple also gifted Fredericksburg, Texas with a home for the county's Pioneer Memorial Library by restoring the 1882 Gillespie County Courthouse. McDermott was actively involved in the arts, serving not only on the Boards of the Dallas Public Library, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, but also helping conceive of the Margo Jones Theatre, an early experiment in theatre in the round. The annual Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts was created at MIT in 1974, and carries a $100,000 stipend . The Award celebrates individuals whose artistic trajectory reveals that they will achieve the highest distinction in their fields and continue to produce inspiring work for many years to come. The stipend represents an investment in the recipient‚Äôs future creative work, rather than a prize for a particular project or lifetime of achievement. The awardee becomes an artist in residence at MIT, studying and teaching for a period of time.

Early life  Born in Brooklyn, New York on March 17, 1929, Florence was the daughter of Samuel, a taxi driver, and Frances Stilly Rosenfeld, a bookkeeper. Florence loved learning from a young age. Her mother encouraged her daughter to follow a teaching career.  Education  In 1943, Howe entered New York City's highly selective Hunter College High School. She was one of only five young women from Brooklyn to do so. She graduated high school early and attended Hunter College. In 1949, she was awarded entrance to Phi Beta Kappa, the elite academic organization which commends superlative academic achievement. Various people in power encouraged her to take graduate courses in literature and to become a college professor. After receiving a BA in English in 1950 from Hunter College, Howe entered Smith College and earned an MA in English in 1951.In 1954, Howe attended the University of Wisconsin, resuming her work in graduate studies for art history and literature. She was awarded an honorary doctorate by DePauw University in 1987.  Career  In 1960, Howe was employed as an assistant professor in the English department at a private women's college, Goucher College, located in Maryland. She taught African American children in a Mississippi freedom school during 1964 and chaired the Modern Language Association commission on the Status of Women in the Profession. In 1964, Howe‚Äôs book Myths of Coeducation, featured one of her essays titled ‚ÄúMississippi Freedom Schools: the Politics of Education.‚Äù In 1965, the essay was published in the Harvard Education Review. This essay written by Howe explains her journey with feminism and how she was able to relate issues such as education, race and politics within feminism. In 1967, she signed a public statement declaring her intention to refuse to pay income taxes in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam. Howe also founded The Feminist Press in 1970, \\"an educational nonprofit organization founded to advance women's rights and amplify feminist perspectives\\", the organization had published three books by 1973. In 1973, Florence Howe took on the role of President of the Modern Language Association after being voted in. In 1978, another essay written by Howe titled ‚ÄúMyths of Coeducation‚Äù, explains women's education and how it ‚Äúfunctions within the patriarchal limits of the society in which it exists.‚Äù From 1972‚Äì1982, Florence Howe assisted in editing the Women's Studies Quarterly, a peer-reviewed journal. In 1977, Florence Howe was presented with an honorary doctorate in humane letters from New England College. In 1979, Florence Howe was presented with another honorary doctorate in humane letters, given by Skidmore College. Florence Howe was responsible in co-editing various literature pieces throughout the years, such as ‚ÄúWith Wings: An Anthology of Literature By and About Disabled Women (1987); Traditions and the Talents of Women (1991); and No More Masks (1993).‚Äù In 1982, Florence Howe published the Feminist Scholarship: The Extent of the Revolution, a journal article in which she wrote about her findings with feminism in higher education. In the years 1983 and 1993, Florence Howe served as a U.S. Department of State Grantee. In 1987, Florence was employed as a professor of humanities at SUNY. Personal life Howe married three times during the 1950s‚Äì1960s, and took the last name of one of her husbands, Ed Howe. She married Paul Lauter in the 1960s and divorced him in 1987. In 1964, while living in Baltimore, Florence Howe travelled to Jackson, Mississippi as a Freedom Summer volunteer and was tasked with serving as a teacher in a Freedom School for black children. There she met a 16-year-old girl, Alice Jackson, with whom she became close. Alice came with her to Baltimore and Florence became her second mother, although an adoption was never formalized. Florence had no children of her own, and she was survived by Alice, her two children and four grandchildren, who referred to Florence as Baba. Death Florence Howe died on September 12, 2020 in New York City, at the age of 91. She lived on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, and prior to her death received hospice care for Parkinson's disease.  The Florence Howe Award  The Florence Howe Award for feminist scholarship of the Women's Caucus for the Modern Languages is named in her honor.

The pcap API is written in C, so other languages such as Java, .NET languages, and scripting languages generally use a wrapper; no such wrappers are provided by libpcap or WinPcap itself. C++ programs may link directly to the C API or use an object-oriented wrapper.  Features  libpcap, WinPcap, and Npcap provide the packet-capture and filtering engines of many open-source and commercial network tools, including protocol analyzers (packet sniffers), network monitors, network intrusion detection systems, traffic-generators and network-testers. libpcap, WinPcap, and Npcap also support saving captured packets to a file, and reading files containing saved packets; applications can be written, using libpcap, WinPcap, or Npcap, to be able to capture network traffic and analyze it, or to read a saved capture and analyze it, using the same analysis code. A capture file saved in the format that libpcap, WinPcap, and Npcap use can be read by applications that understand that format, such as tcpdump, Wireshark, CA NetMaster, or Microsoft Network Monitor 3.x. The MIME type for the file format created and read by libpcap, WinPcap, and Npcap is application/vnd.tcpdump.pcap. The typical file extension is .pcap, although .cap and .dmp are also in common use.  History  libpcap was originally developed by the tcpdump developers in the Network Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The low-level packet capture, capture file reading, and capture file writing code of tcpdump was extracted and made into a library, with which tcpdump was linked. It is now developed by the same tcpdump.org group that develops tcpdump.  pcap libraries for Windows  While libpcap was originally developed for Unix-like operating systems, a successful port for Windows was made, called WinPcap. It has been unmaintained since 2013, and several competing forks have been released with new features and support for newer versions of Windows. = WinPcap = WinPcap consists of: * x86 and x86-64 drivers for the Windows NT family (Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, 7, 8, and 10), which use Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 5.x to read packets directly from a network adapter; * implementations of a lower-level library for the listed operating systems, to communicate with those drivers; * a port of libpcap that uses the API offered by the low-level library implementations. Programmers at the Politecnico di Torino wrote the original code; as of 2008 CACE Technologies, a company set up by some of the WinPcap developers, developed and maintained the product. CACE was acquired by Riverbed Technology on October 21, 2010. Because WinPcap uses the older NDIS 5.x APIs, it does not work on some builds of Windows 10, which have deprecated or removed those APIs in favor of the newer NDIS 6.x APIs. It also forces some limitations such as being unable to capture 802.1Q VLAN tags in Ethernet headers. = Npcap = Npcap is the Nmap Project's packet sniffing library for Windows. It is based on the Winpcap / Libpcap libraries, but with improved speed, portability, security, and efficiency. Npcap offers: * NDIS 6 Support: Npcap makes use of new NDIS 6 Light-Weight Filter (LWF) API in Windows Vista and later (the legacy driver is used on XP). It's faster than the deprecated NDIS 5 API. * Latest libpcap API Support: Npcap provides support for the latest libpcap API by accepting libpcap as a Git submodule. The latest libpcap 1.8.0 has integrated more fascinating features and functions than the deprecated libpcap 1.0.0 shipped by WinPcap. Moreover, since Linux already has a good support for latest libpcap API, using Npcap on Windows facilitates software to base on the same API on both Windows and Linux. * Extra Security: Npcap can be restricted so that only Administrators can sniff packets. Non- Admin user will have to pass a User Account Control (UAC) dialog to utilize the driver. This is conceptually similar to UNIX, where root access is generally required to capture packets. The driver also has Windows ASLR and DEP security features enabled. * WinPcap compatibility: If selected, Npcap will use the WinPcap-style DLL directories (‚Äúc:\\\\Windows\\\\System32‚Äù) and service name (‚Äúnpf‚Äù), allowing software built with WinPcap in mind to transparently use Npcap instead. If compatibility mode is not selected, Npcap is installed in a different location with a different service name so that both drivers can coexist on the same system. * Loopback Packet Capture: Npcap is able to sniff loopback packets (transmissions between services on the same machine) by using the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP). After installation, Npcap will create an adapter named Npcap Loopback Adapter. * Loopback Packet Injection: Npcap is also able to send loopback packets using the Winsock Kernel (WSK) technique. * Raw 802.11 Packet Capture: Npcap is able to see 802.11 packets instead of fake Ethernet packets on ordinary wireless adapters. = Win10Pcap = Win10Pcap implementation is also based on the NDIS 6 driver model and works stably with Windows 10. As of 2020, the project has however been inactive since 2016.  Programs that use libpcap  * Apache Drill, an open source SQL engine for interactive analysis of large scale datasets. * Bit-Twist, a libpcap-based Ethernet packet generator and editor for BSD, Linux, and Windows. * Cain and Abel, a password recovery tool for Microsoft Windows * EtherApe, a graphical tool for monitoring network traffic and bandwidth usage in real time. * Firesheep, an extension for the Firefox web browser that captures packets and performs session hijacking * iftop, a tool for displaying bandwidth usage (like top for network traffic) * Kismet, for 802.11 wireless LANs * L0phtCrack, a password auditing and recovery application. * McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator, Rogue System Detection feature * ngrep, aka \\"network grep\\", isolate strings in packets, show packet data in human-friendly output. * Nmap, a port-scanning and fingerprinting network utility * Pirni, a network security tool for jailbroken iOS devices. * Scapy, a packet manipulation tool for computer networks, written in Python by Philippe Biondi. * Snort, a network- intrusion-detection system. * Suricata, a network intrusion prevention and analysis platform. * Symantec Data Loss Prevention, Used to monitor and identify sensitive data, track its use, and location.

He was born on-screen during the episode broadcast on 25 December 1990. He was played by Thomas Ormson from his first appearance until 15 March 2000 when Ormson left. Jack P. Shepherd took over the role and made his first on screen appearance on 26 April 2000. In July 2019, Shepherd took a four-month break from the show. Storylines David is the son of Martin (Sean Wilson) and Gail Platt (Helen Worth). David was born on Christmas Day 1990. Martin's friend, Carmel Finnan (Catherine Cusack), tried to kidnap David when he was a toddler. She also posed as his mother to other characters. Carmel then tries to frame Gail for pushing her down the stairs and is revealed to be mentally ill. In 2000, a nine-year-old David becomes jealous of the attention his newborn niece Bethany Platt (Amy and Emily Walton) is getting. He decides to get attention by getting arrested for shoplifting. In 2001, Gail and Martin divorce after Martin had an affair with Rebecca Hopkins (Jill Halfpenny). David is unhappy and begins misbehaving in the hope that they will get back together. David becomes the target of a school bully and, despite Gail's advice to ignore the bully, he becomes violent and gets into fights. His behaviour worsens when Gail marries Richard Hillman (Brian Capron) in July 2002, but he comes to accept Richard. In March 2003, Richard is revealed to be a serial killer and tries to kill himself, Gail, David, Bethany and her mother - David's sister - Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) by driving them into the local canal. Gail, Sarah, David and Bethany are all rescued, while Richard drowns. In the years following, David develops a penchant for lying and scheming both at home and at school. He is unhappy with Gail's relationship with Phil Nail (Clive Russell) and begins a hate campaign against Phil. David does not trust Phil, due to Richard's behaviour. Phil reaches a breaking point with David and throws him up against a wall, threatening to beat him up. David tells Gail, but Phil lies to her and Gail believes him and slaps David, unaware that he is telling the truth. Gail receives a card addressed from Richard. She suspects Phil of sending the cards. Realising David is behind the scam, Phil throws David across the table in front of Gail. An angry Gail ends their relationship. The Platt family continue to receive cards from Richard, and Gail realises David is the culprit. Gail blames herself for David's behaviour. In December 2006, David discovers Sarah's grandmother Ivy Tilsley's (Lynne Perrie) diary and reads it, and is shocked that Gail had wanted to abort him, but he understands this after Gail told him that Ivy had been having a rough time since the death of her son and Gail's then-husband, Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten). He develops romantic feelings for Maria Sutherland (Samia Longchambon), but is annoyed she is enjoying an affair with Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). Charlie threatens David into silence. David tries to blackmail Charlie, who tries drowning David in a bath to rid of him, but Maria walks in and saves him. In January 2007, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) murders Charlie, staging it to look like self-defence. David offers to testify for Tracy that he saw Charlie attack her, on the condition that she sleeps with him. Tracy agrees, but the prosecution proves David's testimony to be lies. In January 2008, David begins a relationship with Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) and she becomes pregnant. In March 2008, Gail pays for an abortion and they decide not to tell David. He finds out and, in an argument, he pushes Gail down the stairs. He persuades Tina to give him an alibi, but she ends their romance. David smashes various vehicles and windows on the Street, attacks Ken Barlow (William Roache) and hits a policewoman. He is sentenced to four months in a Young Offenders Institution. When he is released, Tina reconciles with him, but faces more issues when a jealous David reads her emails. He dates Amber Kalirai (Nikki Patel) in an attempt to make Tina jealous, which has the desired effect and they get back together. In November 2008, David feuds with the Windass family when they refuse to pay for work Tina's father Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) has carried out. David threatens Eddie (Steve Huison) and Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) with a crowbar. Len (Conor Ryan) and Gary Windass (Mikey North) steal Joe's work tools in retaliation. David then destroys their kitchen, so the Windass family remove the Platt's kitchen from their house. Gail and Anna are forced to call a truce to avoid more problems. David spends time away from Weatherfield when Tina wants nothing more to do with him. Upon his return, he becomes jealous of Tina and Gary's friendship. David frames Gary for theft and also tricks him into buying stolen goods. He then enlists Gary to commit robbery, which goes wrong when Gail's father Ted Page (Michael Byrne), interrupts them, calls the police and has a heart attack. Gary decides to confess to the police, which leads to David being arrested. David becomes jealous when Tina begins a relationship with Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). David discovers that Joe is addicted to prescription medication and agrees to supply him with drugs as long as he tries to break Tina and Jason up. In February 2010, Joe drowns in a boating accident while on his honeymoon in the Lake District, but the police presume that he has been murdered and arrest Gail. David has to scheme in order to prove Gail's innocence. In late-2010, Tina begins a relationship with Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey). This upsets David and he feels betrayed. David suffers a black-out while driving and knocks Graeme over. No one believes David's versions of events and the police arrest him for attempted murder. Before the court case is about to begin, David passes out again and everyone begins to realise he was telling the truth. He is found to be suffering from epilepsy. David returns from a holiday in Tenerife and announces his engagement to \\"Candy\\", aka Kylie Turner (Paula Lane). Gail is angry and tries to convince David to change his mind as she does not like Kylie. David and Kylie then get married in April 2011. David fights to take custody of Kylie's son Max Turner (Harry McDermott), but ends up feuding with her sister Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly), with Kylie trying to avoid it. David insists that Steve and Becky are not fit to look after Max, proving this when he saves Max from being run over. David has to deal with Gail and Kylie feuding. But when he learns that Gail has tried to bribe Kylie to leave, he threatens to leave home. Kylie gets a job at the salon with David. He is upset when Max is put up for adoption and she does not want to prevent this. He tells her they must change their ways and convince social services to allow Max to live with them. In August 2013, David discovers that Kylie has slept with Nick but does not confront them. He vandalises Nick's flat and writes poison pen letters to his wife Leanne. Nick tells David he knows that he is behind the trouble and suggests they discuss it with Kylie. To prevent Kylie from finding out, David causes a car accident. Nick is left in a coma which results in permanent brain damage. To his relief, David learns that he is Lily's biological father, but when Kylie discovers that he is the reason behind Nick's injuries, she throws him out. Following their reconciliation, and a holiday to Barbados to visit Becky, Max's behaviour at home and at school gets worse and is diagnosed with A.D.H.D in August 2014, and Kylie becomes addicted to his medication. In a quest to get to the source of Max's A.D.H.D, she travels to her old haunt, a pub called The Dog & Gun in Wythenshawe, where she grew up. There, she encounters her ex-boyfriend and Max's biological father Callum. The pair continued to have secret meetings for weeks where Kylie gets hooked on amphetamine and Callum demands to see Max. David throws Kylie out after he finds out about her taking drugs and she leaves Weatherfield on Christmas Day 2014. In January 2015, Max's father Callum Logan (Sean Ward) arrives and wants access to Max. When David refuses Callum starts a custody battle, which begins a violent feud. Kylie returns in May 2015 and helps strengthen David's claim to Max. Their feud escalates and he manipulates Sarah and Bethany (now played by Lucy Fallon). When they try to frame Callum for a crime in September 2015, he attacks Sarah and Kylie kills Callum to protect her. David decides to help cover the murder up and buries the body down a manhole in their home. When a car crash occurs in May 2016, rescue workers find Callum's body buried beneath the concrete. David is initially the main suspect, but they frame the recently deceased Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), Jason's father, another of Callum's enemies, who happens to be dead. In July 2016, Kylie decides she cannot live in the house Callum died in any longer. David agrees to relocate their family to Barbados with Kylie. Their plans are ruined when Clayton Hibbs (Callum Harrison) stabs Kylie in the street and she dies in David's arms. David then attacks Clayton who is then charged with Kylie's murder. Gail is concerned about David and his calm attitude towards planning Kylie's funeral. In October 2016, David wants revenge for Kylie's murder, believing there will be no justice for Kylie. He publicly names Clayton, despite Clayton being fifteen years old, as Kylie's killer and attempts to kill Macca Hibbs, Clayton's step-brother, while he's in hospital. David plans his final act of revenge on Clayton by crashing his new car into the police van Clayton is in by igniting a large amount of petrol to blow them both up. After he makes a suicide video, Gail, Nick, and Sarah see it and lock David inside the cellar of the Bistro until the trial is finished. After tricking Gail into thinking that he has committed suicide, David escapes the Bistro, gets into his car that is doused in petrol and drives off. However, as he speeds along, David spots Lily on the road and swerves to avoid her, but ends up flipping the car, which lands on Lily and Gary (who had attempted to rescue Lily). Some of the residents are able to get Gary and Lily out as David manages to get out of the car. However, a spark causes the car to catch fire and explodes, setting Anna on fire leaving her badly injured, while David looks on in horror. Sarah admits to Gary, who she is in a relationship with, what David did, but she persuades him not to tell anyone for the sake of Max and Lily. David inherits ¬£20,000 from a client who dies, as well as a dog named after him. Gary finds out from Sarah about the money, so David gives Anna and Kevin ¬£19,000. In 2017, he begins a relationship with an older woman, Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding), who he later discovers is Clayton's estranged mother. Despite this, they reconcile after working together to imprison Shona's ex-boyfriend Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) for sexually grooming Bethany. By November 2017, he went through a dramatic change in appearance and grew a beard. In March 2018, David is drugged and raped by his new friend Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton) following a night out. He is left ashamed and embarrassed by the ordeal. He then goes with Max and Lily to visit his dad Martin, at his home in Liverpool; who is preparing to emigrate to New Zealand. Martin, sensing something is wrong with David, travels back to Weatherfield to speak to him. Following the rape, David starts lashing out at everyone, worrying Shona, Gail, Martin, Sarah, Gary, Bethany and Audrey as well as many other residents. He takes Tyrone's place in the charity boxing event, his opponent is Gary. When they fight, David has flashbacks and he brutally attacks Gary while everyone watches in horror. This leaves Gary fighting for his life. Sarah doesn't believe her own brother would do such a thing. But what nobody knows, except David himself, is he's still suffering mentally and emotionally from when Josh drugged and raped him. This leads to him breaking up with Shona, saying he doesn't love her anymore. This leads to her moving out and moving in with Roy Cropper (David Neilson) at his flat above Roy's Rolls. He later starts a relationship with apprentice hairdresser Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell) who is only a year older than his niece Bethany. On the day of his trial for attacking Gary, he runs off while his solicitor Imran Habeeb (Charlie de Melo) is distracted. Shona finds him and he reveals his rape to her after finding out about Aidan Connor's (Shayne Ward) suicide. They get back together and Shona promises to stay by his side. David later tells Gail and Audrey about the rape while Gail tells Sarah. While doing community service for beating up Gary, he and another man make homophobic jibes towards gay vicar Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank). When Billy later asks him to apologise, David refuses and Billy locks the door. David breaks down and admits to Billy that he was raped. Billy later follows David when he follows Josh and a potential victim. Billy tells him to go home and to do nothing. Billy later contradicts himself and warns the man of Josh. Josh gets beaten up by this man and ends up in hospital. He becomes blind and Billy regularly visits him out of guilt. Billy then lets Josh live with him as he has nowhere else to go. David and Shona find out and are disgusted with Billy. He is also furious when he finds out that Bethany knew about Billy visiting Josh in hospital. After Josh re-evaluates his behaviour, he visits David in the salon, however, he still will not admit to raping him. David kidnaps him and tricks him into thinking they are outside a police station. When Josh breaks down and pleads that his life would be hell in prison, David gets closure and tells Josh that they are in an alleyway, before leaving him stranded. In 2019, Shona's now 18-year-old son Clayton faces the possibility of being transferred to an open prison in Liverpool as his safety is jeopardised at Highfield Prison, with injuries to prove it. David is unhappy with this as there is a chance of him visiting Weatherfield at weekends. Clayton's father, Dane, was trying to get his son transferred before his untimely death from a drug overdose. Shona decided to attend her ex-partner Dane's funeral but lied to David of her whereabouts. Clayton was unhappy to see Shona there as he wished she had died instead of Dane. The funeral turned out to be a breakout plot devised by Clayton's stepbrother Macca, with thugs posing as undertakers cutting Clayton's handcuffs with bolt cutters, and he runs away. Shona is arrested for helping him escape but denies having a role in his escape plot and she is released from custody shortly afterwards. In July 2019, David is framed for stealing Audrey's money and is sentenced to four months in prison, while Nick, the person who really stole the money, is sentenced to 2 years imprisonment but receives a suspended sentence. In October that same year, David is due to be released in a few weeks, in the lead up to his release he befriends a prisoner named Abe. Shortly after he goes to take his medication in the medical wing, to the horror of David, he sees Josh. Abe tells David that a person named Tez is planning a prison riot where they will go and kill Josh. David wants no involvement in this. During the riot, David stays in his cell but then Josh gets forced into the cell by Abe where he tells David to stab Josh. He refuses. The riot is seen by Shona, Sarah, and Max on the news. David and Josh leave the cell and Josh kicks Tez to slow them down, (who wants Josh dead). They make it into a room and barricade the door. David then says that he only saved Josh for him to suffer. Josh then starts taunting David, after that it isn't known if David stabbed Josh or not. David later manages to ring Shona via mobile phone to tell her what happened, she asks whether he stabbed Josh or not but doesn't answer. But is later visited in and tells Shona he didn't do it. In January 2020, David arrived at Josh's court date after receiving a letter asking him to testify as Josh pleaded not guilty. David almost dropped it because Shona was his main priority, but David was convinced by Gail and went to testify. David was left worried after what Josh's solicitor said. Later, his solicitor Imran Habeeb visits David in the hospital, notifying him that Josh was found guilty of raping him and other people and that he received a sentence of 15 years. David was left shocked and relieved. Development This was the first time that male rape had been a storyline in the programme's history, though such a theme had occurred on other soap operas. Ryan Clayton was cast as Josh in January 2018. In January 2018, it was confirmed that Sean Wilson would be returning to Coronation Street after a thirteen-year absence as David's father Martin as part of the rape storyline. Reception In August 2017, Shepherd was longlisted for \\"Best Actor\\" and \\"Funniest Male\\" at the Inside Soap Awards. He did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. On 2 June 2018, Shepherd was awarded his first \\"Best Actor\\" accolade at The British Soap Awards 2018, following his performances during the rape storyline. In July 2018, Shepherd was longlisted for \\"Best Actor\\" and \\"Best Partnership\\", alongside Julia Goulding who plays Shona Ramsey, at the Inside Soap Awards. For his portrayal of David, Shepherd was nominated for Best Soap Actor (Male) at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; he came in third place with 9.5% of the total vote. David's male rape storyline was also nominated in the \\"Best Soap Storyline\\" category, while David and Shona's partnership was nominated in the \\"Best Soap Couple\\" category. Both nominations came in sixth place with 9.5% and 5.8% of their total votes respectively. In 2019, Shepherd received a National Television Awards nomination in the Serial Drama Performance category for his portrayal of David. Fearing real-life imitation of the scene in which David was tortured by Charlie Stubbs, many formal complaints were filed by viewers with the Government's Office of Communications. In the end, Coronation Street was cleared by TV watchdogs after 31 complaints about scenes of 'bullying and torture'\\". Tony Stewart of the Daily Mirror refers to the character as \\"David Pratt\\" when writing reviews of any storyline he features in, due to the character's way of seemingly always getting away with outlandish things. In magazine articles, he is often referred to as \\"Demon David\\", \\"Teen Tormenter\\", \\"Ratboy\\" or \\"Psycho Platt\\".

Born in England to Nigerian parents, Sodje represented Nigeria at international level. Club careerEarly years= Sodje was born in Greenwich, London and joined Margate at the beginning of the 2002‚Äì03 season and scored on his debut with a header. He won the Supporters' Player of the Year award at the end of his first season with Margate. In the summer of 2003, he went on trial at Yeovil Town and Chester City, but neither team signed him. He returned to Margate to play Conference football for the 2003‚Äì04 season and impressed once again. =Brentford= At the beginning of the 2004‚Äì05 season, he moved from Margate to League One side Brentford on a free transfer. He became popular with the Brentford fans through a combination of his goal-scoring, and his crazy hairstyles. At the end of that season he won a local newspaper award for player of the season, and at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season he was honoured with a place in the PFA League One team of the year. =Reading= It was revealed Sodje had turned down a move to Southampton on 31 January 2006, the final day of the transfer window. Much transfer speculation followed until it was announced on 12 July 2006 that Sodje would join Reading, subject to a medical; the transfer was completed on 14 July 2006. Sodje made his Reading d√©but away to Wigan Athletic on 26 August 2006 because of a suspension to Ibrahima Sonko, and scored his first Reading goal against Burnley in the FA Cup on 9 January 2007. However, his first team opportunities in the 2006‚Äì07 proved to be limited, so on 16 March 2007 he signed a month's loan deal with West Bromwich Albion, which was subsequently extended to the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. Whilst there, he helped The Baggies to a place in the Championship Playoff Final, which they lost 1‚Äì0 to Derby County. He scored once for West Brom, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Norwich City on 9 April 2007. In the summer 2007 transfer window, Sheffield Wednesday agreed a fee with Reading for Sodje, with Sodje given the opportunity to think over the move. However, Sodje eventually joined Charlton Athletic on loan for the remainder of the 2007‚Äì08 season. He made his Charlton d√©but in the club's 2‚Äì0 victory over Norwich City as a late substitute on 18 September 2007. His performance in Charlton's 3‚Äì1 home win over Ipswich Town on 8 December 2007 earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week. In September 2008, Sodje joined fellow Championship side Watford on a month's loan as cover for the team's injuries. He played in one game away at Sheffield United before returning to Reading after aggravating a knee injury. =Leeds United (loan)= On 26 March 2009, Sodje joined Leeds United on loan for a month with an option to extend the loan until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, after impressing in his first month the loan was extended until the end of the season. Sodje partnered Richard Naylor at centre back and formed a strong partnership with him during his loan spell, even though Sodje only played 8 times during his loan spell with Leeds including the playoff semi finals against Millwall =Second spell at Charlton Athletic= On 28 May 2009, Reading told Sodje that he was free to leave the club. Sodje returned on a free transfer to the club he was on loan with two-seasons prior, Charlton Athletic. Sodje made his full d√©but in the 0‚Äì0 game at his former club Leeds United. The club being local to his birthplace of Greenwich, he stated that the club was 'in my blood'. On 14 November, Sodje's brother Akpo, joined him at the club on loan from Sheffield Wednesday. Sodje was part of the Charlton side which reached the League 1 playoffs, they were knocked out of the playoffs after losing on penalties to Swindon Town. Sodje missed the two semi finals after suffering an injury. In total Sodje scored four goals for Charlton during the 2009‚Äì10 season. =Skoda Xanthi= In July 2010, Sodje joined Greek club Skoda Xanthi, the club also signed George Boateng.

It commemorates Major General Benedict Arnold's service at the Battles of Saratoga in the Continental Army, but does not name him.  Background  John Watts de Peyster, a former Major General for the New York State Militia during the American Civil War and writer of several military histories about the Battle of Saratoga, erected the monument to commemorate Arnold's contribution to the Continental Army's victory over the British. Arnold was wounded in the foot during the Battle of Quebec, and suffered further injury in the Battle of Ridgefield when his horse was shot out from under him. His last battle injury was at Saratoga, and it occurred near where this monument is located at Tour Stop #7 ‚Äì Breymann Redoubt. The leg wound effectively ended his career as a fighting soldier. It reads:  Arnold's perceived offenses  Arnold suffered what he considered a series of slights and insults by the Continental Congress in the months and years following Saratoga, as the Revolutionary War continued. He also opposed treaties that brought French military assistance to the Americans. The wounded Arnold began negotiations with British agents that culminated in his changing sides in September 1780. As part of these negotiations, Arnold attempted unsuccessfully to hand his American command, the key fortification of West Point, over to the British. This attempt failed because of the capture of Major John Andr√©. Following the overall failure of the treasonous operation, Arnold escaped to the British lines. As a reward for turning his coat, Arnold was paid ¬£6,000 and commissioned as a brigadier general in the King's troops. For the rest of the war he headed raiding parties that probed Continental Congress-controlled territories and tried to do damage. Based on one of these raids, an apocryphal story that has circulated in various versions states: Benedict Arnold is not mentioned by name on the Boot Monument; the monument thus serves as a form of damnatio memoriae.

The film was named after a popular country song, \\"Take This Job and Shove It\\", which was written by David Allan Coe and sung by Johnny Paycheck; both men had minor roles in the film. Plot A corporate conglomerate called \\"The Ellison Group\\" acquires four breweries, all of them experiencing financial trouble. Enter Frank Macklin (Robert Hays), a young manager hired by Ellison to help reorganize one of the ailing breweries. The only thing, though, is that brewery is a major employer in his home town. Originally, his old friends, who work at the brewery, give him a cold welcome, as they think he'll be unable to revitalize the brewery. But when Frank informs them that the brewery is drowning in red ink, and that they may be losing their jobs soon, they welcome him with open arms, and ramp up the brewery's sales and production. The brewery improves so much that the Ellison Group decids to sell it to a Texas oil millionaire, who doesn't know the first thing about running a brewery or ‚Äî apparently ‚Äî running a business.

Take This Job and Shove It was the first film to feature monster trucks. Bob Chandler's Bigfoot #1 is seen throughout the movie as Ray's pick-up truck. Everett Jasmer's USA-1, credited as \\"Thunderin' Lightning\\", is the blue truck at the starting line that, in the script, breaks down when the race starts. Jasmer's daily delivery truck was used as the rival truck to Bigfoot, known as Silver Bullet. Both trucks are shown sleigh the 48-inch tires that were the then-standard monster truck tire (as opposed to the 66-inch tires that became standard later). Bob Chandler is seen as the flagman at the beginning of the race, and his family can be seen throughout the picnic sequences. The Dubuque Star Brewery still stands today in the same location. It has been renovated and is now a private bar and grill. Release The film was released by Avco Embassy in the United States on May 15, 1981, and became somewhat of a sleeper hit.

The games have been developed by Japan-based HAL Laboratory, a Nintendo second-party developer. All Kirby video games have been developed exclusively for Nintendo video game consoles and handhelds dating from the Nintendo Entertainment System to the current generation of video game consoles. The series debuted in Japan on April 27, 1992 with which later was released in the North American and PAL regions on August 1992 as Kirby's Dream Land. The series revolves around Kirby, the series' protagonist, and his adventures in the fictional world of Pop Star. A common gameplay element is Kirby's ability to copy enemy skills, allowing him to use them to progress through levels. This and other changes in gameplay from traditional platform games distinguish the series from other entries in the genre. Currently, the series contains twenty games. A one-hundred episode anime series based on the video games, Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, was created in Japan and formerly distributed by 4Kids TV in North America. A special 101st episode was created for the now retired Nintendo Video service, and was not in the anime style of the original 100 episodes. The Kirby series is among the best-selling video game franchises with over twenty million games sold worldwide. The franchise was conceived by Masahiro Sakurai as a game series for beginners, for which he partially attributes the series' success.

The construction plans for the dam would lead to the flooding of about 300 square kilometers and would displace up to 78,000 people from the Hasankeyf district of the Batman province. Initial plans for the dam The main purpose of the dam is the production of hydroelectric power, but it's also supposed to provide better irrigation for local agriculture. Those who oppose the dam claim that human rights and environmental issues have been disregarded in the planning. The dam would also lead to the drowning of hundreds of archeological sites, including the ancient town of Hasankeyf. The Swedish based Skanska, withdrew from the project in September 2000. In November 2001 the campaign won an important victory when it achieved that the UK based company Balfour Beatty decided to withdraw from the Ilƒ±su Dam project due to ethical, environmental and economical concerns. The companies involved in the project had applied for Export Credit Guarantees from their home governments, which meant that taxpayers money would be used to finance the project. Current plans The plans for the dam were not scrapped however, and in 2005 the project resurfaced. This time one of the main contractors of the dam was Austria-based VA TECH, a subsidiary of Siemens AG. According to the Turkish government, new resettlement plans were planned and a large fund was supposed to be set up to rescue some parts of the town of Hasankeyf by moving them elsewhere.

He was minister until August 2009, when Ahmadinejad was reelected and appointed Mohammad-Najjar as minister of interior. He received 178 to 72 of votes and became minister to succeed Sadegh Mahsouli. Activities and views During his tenure as minister of defense, Najjar frequently attacked the West's nuclear abilities and fiercely defended Iran's right to advance its peaceful nuclear energy program.‚ÄúAmericans Should be Sanctioned, ‚ÄúFardanews‚Äù According to his military philosophy, missile capabilities play an important role in the defense of Iran and in its overall military abilities. Najjar believes that \\"they serve the interests of stability and peace in the region\\" and are an integral part \\"‚Ä¶of the power of defense of the Islamic world.\\" According to Najjar (October 2007), \\"Iranian missiles are not a threat to any country, and they will only fall on the heads of those who attack Iranian territory.\\"‚ÄúIranian Advanced Missiles‚Äù, ‚ÄúFardanews‚Äù‚ÄúNajjar: Iran's missiles down on rapists‚Äù, ‚ÄúFardanews‚Äù In response to the test of the long-range surface-to-surface Sajil missile, Najjar said it was designed \\"‚Ä¶for deterrence and to safeguard the stability of the region.\\"‚ÄúShahab-3 missile has a longer range than Sajil‚Äù, ‚ÄúFardanews‚Äù Throughout his tenure, Najjar has focused on Iran's military-technological independence and on ensuring the country would not be dependent on the supply of weapons systems from other countries.‚ÄúDefense Minister attended the opening of five new systems‚Äù, ‚ÄúFardanews‚Äù This was emphasized in his statement upon handing over the reigns of his position to his successor (September 2009): After assuming the position of interior minister, Najjar gathered all the employees of the ministry, sharing both his worldview and the main tasks of the Ministry: During his term, there were increasingly harsh punishments for dress code violations and morals. The enforcement of the dress code gained significant momentum and dedicated mechanisms and organizations were established to promote enforcement along with measures \\"‚Ä¶to strengthen the Islamic faith.\\" Throughout his term, he has taken a hard line when it comes to suppressing protests and the opposition in Iran, referring to them as fitna, and saying that they were acting against the best interests of the Iranian people. In the middle of July 2010 demonstrations, he called in Iran's Law Enforcement Forces (LEF), warning against a \\"Velvet Revolution\\" and \\"imperialist plots.\\"\\"Minister: There is no border control necessary\\", \\"Fardanews\\" Najjar warned against activity on social networks and satellite channels: \\"The West is taking advantage of electronic systems and the virtual world to undermine the security of our society and break down the family unit in Iran. This is a matter which must be thoroughly investigated.\\"‚ÄúMinister: Facebook, satellite and chat and are examples of soft war‚Äù, ‚ÄúAftab News‚Äù There has been an increase in Iran of monitoring of the Internet, arrests of bloggers and blocking of e-mail accounts. At the same time, Najjar responded to the increased activity of the Sunni opposition (Jundallah) with a security clampdown on Iran's eastern borders. During his tenure, Najjar had to grapple with the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and said (July 2011) that \\"this issue is our top priority\\" and that his Ministry had implemented a special program to guard nuclear scientists.\\"‚ÄúProtection of the elites is government priority‚Äù, ‚ÄúFardanews‚Äù The tough and violent approach taken by Najjar during the repression of the protests after the 2009 elections put him and other senior Iranian officials on the U.S. designation for serious human rights abuses involving Iran.

She was the daughter of African-American Shakespearian actor Ira Aldridge.  Life  Amanda Aldridge was born on 10 March 1866 in Upper Norwood, London, the third child of African-American Shakespearian actor Ira Frederick Aldridge and his second wife, the Swedish Amanda Brandt. Aldridge studied voice under Jenny Lind and Sir George Henschel at the Royal College of Music in London, and harmony and counterpoint with Frederick Bridge and Francis Edward Gladstone. After completing her studies, Aldridge worked as a concert singer, piano accompanist, and voice teacher. A throat condition ended her concert appearances, and she turned to teaching and published about thirty songs between the years 1907 and 1925 in a romantic parlour style, as well as instrumental music in other styles. Her notable students included Roland Hayes, Lawrence Benjamin Brown, Marian Anderson, and Paul Robeson. In 1930, when Robeson played Othello in the West End, Aldridge was in attendance, and gave Robeson the gold earrings that her father Ira Aldridge had worn as Othello. She cared for her sister, the opera singer Luranah Aldridge, when she became ill, turning down an invitation in 1921 from W. E. B. Du Bois to attend the second Pan-African Congress, with a note explaining: \\"As you know, my sister is very helpless. . . . I cannot leave for more than a few minutes at a time.\\" At the age of 88, Aldridge made her first television appearance in the British show Music For You, where Muriel Smith sang Montague Ring's \\"Little Southern Love Song\\". After a short illness, she died in London on 9 March 1956.  Style  Amanda Aldridge ended her singing career to compose and teach music, when laryngitis had damaged her throat. Amanda Aldridge mainly composed Romantic parlour music, a type of popular music performed primarily in parlours of the middle-class homes, frequently by amateur singers and pianists. All of her published music was known under the name of Montague Ring. Under this pseudonym, she gained recognition for her many voice and piano pieces. She composed love songs, suites, sambas and light orchestral pieces, working in a popular style that was infused with multiple genres.

Redford Barracks was built between 1909 and 1915 by the War Office and designed by Harry Bell Measures. When completed, the barracks was the largest military installation built in Scotland since Fort George in the Highlands. The British Army garrison in Edinburgh Castle formally moved out to the barracks in 1923. Today, the Infantry Barracks are unoccupied, and the Cavalry Barracks houses Balaclava Company, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders). The barracks comprises two category B listed main buildings and parade squares facing Colinton Road. Infantry Barracks The Infantry Barracks at Redford The Infantry Barracks (), was originally built to house an entire infantry regiment and could accommodate 1,000 men. It could provide everything the resident line infantry battalion required to function. The families lived in service quarters close to the barracks and the children attended local schools. The main barrack block itself housed the resident Battalion Headquarters, one Rifle Company, a Fire Support Company and Headquarters Company. The two other Rifle Companies were accommodated in a separate, newer block. 3rd Battalion The Rifles, the last battalion to occupy the barracks, moved out in 2014. As part of the Future Force 2020 budgetary announcement in July 2011, RAF Kirknewton was to have been developed into a major Army base to host a Multi-Role Brigade Redford and Dreghorn Barracks would become surplus to requirements and were earmarked for disposal under this plan. However, in December 2011 it was reported that the planned move to Kirknewton was in doubt, and that Redford Barracks would be retained. By 2013 it was confirmed that the MRB plan had been dropped, and that only a part of Redford Barracks would be closed. In 2019, it was announced that the decision to close the barracks was being deferred. Cavalry Barracks The three-storey Cavalry Barracks (), with its tall domed clock-tower, was originally built to house a cavalry regiment, most notably the Royal Scots Greys, with a large annexe of stables and associated outbuildings. With the permanent stationing of armoured units such as the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards in Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine, the Cavalry Barracks became a home to D squadron, Royal Scots Dragoon Guards stationed there from 1971 until disbanded in 1976. The cavalry barracks have been the home for Balaclava Company, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) since 2014.

The others are nearby Rays Hill Tunnel, and farther west, the Laurel Hill Tunnel. It was less expensive to realign the Turnpike than to bore a second tube for four lane traffic. Sideling Hill Tunnel is long. It was the longest of the original tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Ray's Hill Tunnel and Sideling Hill Tunnel are now part of the Pike2Bike Trail. Together, the two tunnels as well as the roadway are commonly known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike. From the Turnpike's opening in 1940 until the realignment projects, the tunnels were bottlenecks; opposing traffic in the same tubes reduced speeds. Four other tunnels on the Turnpike ‚Äì Allegheny Mountain, Tuscarora Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain, and Blue Mountain ‚Äì each had a second tube bored, the least expensive option. All of the original tunnels except for the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel were part of \\"Vanderbilt's Folly\\", the never-completed South Pennsylvania Railroad. HistoryConstruction= The Sideling Hill Tunnel's original plans date back to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885. The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from Rhinebeck, New York. On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred at the end of the Sideling Hill Tunnel. The blast, which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several other people were injured in the blast. Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a Hungarian worker, along with two African-Americans, two Italians, and one Irishman. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast, that the people were almost unidentifiable. Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt, who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began to inflate, and he began to look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission started construction on a new toll highway from Carlisle, Pennsylvania to Irwin, Pennsylvania in 1938. When the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened on October 25, 1940, the Sideling Hill Tunnel was one of the seven original tunnels along the highway, six of which were built from the old railroad tunnels from the 1880s. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was constructed from scratch rather than from the tunnels because of structural concerns. The eastern portal of the Sideling Hill Tunnel in 2009 Beginning in 1951, the eastbound traffic at the Laurel Hill Tunnel would back up during the summer weekends. By 1958, the Laurel Hill experienced congestion anytime from June to November. Because of the long bottlenecks, the Commission started looking into ways to remove the congestion. There were studies that began in the mid-1950s to decide on what to do with the tunnels. The studies looked into the major tunnels, the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain, and the possibility of adding a second tube, or \\"twinning\\", to them. =Tunnel bypass actions= Studies were completed for the remaining five mainline tunnels to determine the cost benefit of twinning of the tunnels, or complete bypass. After the studies completed, the decision was made to go ahead with a US $100 million construction project to work with the tunnels. Construction began on September 6, 1962, with the first subproject being a bypass of the Laurel Hill Tunnel. On October 30, 1964, just two years after construction began, the Laurel Hill Bypass was completed and opened. The Laurel Hill Tunnel was permanently closed on that day. However, this was not the last bypass to occur for tunnels along the turnpike. Two years after the closing of the Laurel Hill, the Allegheny Mountain became the first tunnel to be twinned, and opened on August 25, 1966. With the twinning of the Blue Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain and Tuscarora Mountain tunnels under construction, the Commission turned its focus to the remaining two mainline tunnels, the Rays Hill Tunnel (the shortest tunnel) and the Sideling Hill Tunnel (the longest tunnel). The site of the former Cove Valley Travel Plaza. The Sideling Hill Tunnel is about a half mile to the west An engineering report dating back to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels was the best way to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill). In 2001, the Turnpike Commission gave control of the length of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels and other roadways to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy, who began work to convert the stretch into a bicycle trail. The trail is used by hundreds of bicycle riders, and studies occurred in 2004 and 2005 to figure how to best safely construct the trail. Because there is a lack of good lighting in the tunnels the conservancy wants to look into how to solve it. The system is called the Pike2Bike Trail and is planned to be an mountain bicycle loop that serves access to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's BicyclePA Route S.

The carbonyl has two Œ≤-hydrogens and five Œ≥-hydrogens. The alpha carbon (CŒ±) in organic molecules refers to the first carbon atom that attaches to a functional group, such as a carbonyl. The second carbon atom is called the beta carbon (CŒ≤), and the system continues naming in alphabetical order with Greek letters. The nomenclature can also be applied to the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms. A hydrogen atom attached to an alpha carbon atom is called an alpha- hydrogen atom, a hydrogen atom on the beta-carbon atom is a beta hydrogen atom, and so on. This naming standard may not be in compliance with IUPAC nomenclature, which encourages that carbons be identified by number, not by Greek letter, but it nonetheless remains very popular, in particular because it is useful in identifying the relative location of carbon atoms to other functional groups. Organic molecules with more than one functional group can be a source of confusion. Generally the functional group responsible for the name or type of the molecule is the 'reference' group for purposes of carbon- atom naming. For example, the molecules nitrostyrene and phenethylamine are very similar; the former can even be reduced into the latter. However, nitrostyrene's Œ±-carbon atom is adjacent to the phenyl group; in phenethylamine this same carbon atom is the Œ≤-carbon atom, as phenethylamine (being an amine rather than a styrene) counts its atoms from the opposite \\"end\\" of the molecule. File:Beta-nitrostyrene.svgNitrostyrene File:Fenyloetyloamina.svgPhenethylamine Examples alt=Skeletal formula of butyric acid with the alpha, beta, and gamma carbons marked =Proteins and amino acids= Alpha-carbon (Œ±-carbon) is also a term that applies to proteins and amino acids. It is the backbone carbon before the carbonyl carbon atom in the molecule. Therefore, reading along the backbone of a typical protein would give a sequence of ‚Äì[N‚ÄîCŒ±‚Äîcarbonyl C]n‚Äì etc. (when reading in the N to C direction). The Œ±-carbon is where the different substituents attach to each different amino acid. That is, the groups hanging off the chain at the Œ±-carbon are what give amino acids their diversity. These groups give the Œ±-carbon its stereogenic properties for every amino acid except for glycine. Therefore, the Œ±-carbon is a stereocenter for every amino acid except glycine. Glycine also does not have a Œ≤-carbon, while every other amino acid does. The Œ±-carbon of an amino acid is significant in protein folding. When describing a protein, which is a chain of amino acids, one often approximates the location of each amino acid as the location of its Œ±-carbon. In general, Œ±-carbons of adjacent amino acids in a protein are about 3.8 √•ngstr√∂ms (380 picometers) apart. =Enols and enolates= The Œ±-carbon is important for enol- and enolate-based carbonyl chemistry as well. Chemical transformations affected by the conversion to either an enolate or an enol, in general, lead to the Œ±-carbon acting as a nucleophile, becoming, for example, alkylated in the presence of primary haloalkane. An exception is in reaction with silyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides, where the oxygen acts as the nucleophile to produce silyl enol ether.

Hofst√§tter (*1913 in Vienna; ‚Ä† 1994 in Buxtehude) was an Austrian social psychologist whose books on group dynamics, social psychology and general psychology were widely read in the German-speaking countries during the 1960s-1980s. The only child of Robert Matthias Hofst√§tter, M.D., a professor of gynecology at the University of Vienna, he studied physics and psychology in Vienna and received his doctoral degree for a dissertation on the development of Japanese and Korean children. A disciple of Egon Brunswick and Charlotte and Karl B√ºhler, he became the president of the Academic Association for Medical Schools and displayed a considerable interest in the applications of psychology. In this context, he enjoyed contacts with psychoanalysts including Alfred Adler and psychotherapists such as Viktor Frankl. His first published paper focused on psychoanalysis. From 1937 to 1943 he served as an army psychologist initially in the Austrian Federal Army and after 1938 in the German Wehrmacht. Endorsing to various degrees the views of the National Socialists, he subsequently worked in the Reichsjustizministerium (Justice Ministry). Despite his former support for the National Socialist regime he was allowed to teach at the University in Graz beginning in 1947. From 1949 to 1956 he taught in the U.S. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) and the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. In 1956 he returned to Germany to become the first German professor of social psychology at the College for Social Sciences in Wilhelmshaven. Beginning in 1959, he held the Lehrstuhl f√ºr Psychologie and served as department chair at the University of Hamburg, from which he retired in 1979. In the 1950s to 1970s, Hofst√§tter was considered the most prominent social psychologist in the German-speaking countries. Publishing thirteen books focusing on methodology and social psychology, he helped German psychology to become reconnected to international psychology while moving it away from the more speculative and humanities-oriented approach favored by many German psychologists in the 1920s and 1930s. Publishing in 1957 the widely read Fischer-Lexikon Psychologie, he was instrumental in ‚ÄúAmericanizing‚Äù the field which as a consequence became much more empirically oriented. He also succeeded in integrating wide-ranging and historically informed perspectives into his approach to psychology. At the same time his activities as a columnist for the newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt and the weekly magazine Die Zeit made him nationally prominent but also involved him in a bitter controversy when he argued in favor of a general amnesty for German war criminals.

The abandoned tunnel can be seen where there is a path of trees removed from the top of the mountain. Notice the jersey barriers end with the beginning of a wide grassy median. From the turnpike's opening in 1940 until the realignment projects, the tunnels were bottlenecks due to reduced speeds with opposing traffic in the same tubes. Four other tunnels on the turnpike‚ÄîAllegheny Mountain, Tuscarora Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain, and Blue Mountain‚Äîeach had a second tube bored, as it was determined in these instances to be the less expensive option. All of the original tunnels except Allegheny Mountain were part of the never-completed South Pennsylvania Railroad system. Unlike the Sideling Hill and Rays Hill tunnels, the Laurel Hill Tunnel is not on the bypassed section commonly known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike, and the property is still owned by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. In addition, the tunnel is not open to the public. It is routinely patrolled by the Pennsylvania State Police, who strictly enforce \\"no trespassing\\" signs. The stretch of the highway that bypasses Laurel Hill Tunnel climbs to the Turnpike's height elevation, 2,603 feet, at Mile 100.45, just within the border of Somerset County.

Located around , Brewood lies near the River Penk, eight miles north of Wolverhampton city centre and eleven miles south of the county town of Stafford. Some three miles to the west of Brewood is the border with the county of Shropshire. Church of England church of St Mary & St Chad, Brewood. The principal church. Etymology The Norman Domesday Book documented the town as 'Breude'. The name is probably a compound made up of a Celtic, Brythonic word with an Anglo Saxon, Old English word.Cameron, Kenneth (1996) English Place Names. London: Batsford , p.38. The first element is the British word 'briga', which appears in modern Welsh as 'bre'. This is the most common of a number of Celtic place-name elements signifying a hill.Gelling, Margaret (1984) Place-Names in the Landscape. London: J. M. Dent , p. 129 It appears in various combinations, but sometimes on its own, as in Bray. Margaret Gelling, a specialist in West Midland toponyms, suggested that it was often misunderstood by the Anglo-Saxons as a name rather than as a common noun. So they thought they had come upon a place called by the natives Brig or Bre, rather than simply a hill. This is why the word is often combined tautologically, as in Bredon Hill, where all three elements have the same meaning. The second element is probably obvious: the Anglo-Saxon 'wudu', signifying a wood. Hence the name Brewood means either \\"Wood on or by a hill\\" or \\"Wood near a place called Bre\\". History Brewood Church =Origins= The old Roman road, Watling Street, stretching from Londinium across the Roman Province of Britannia Superior to Wroxeter and later Chester, runs one mile to the north of the village as the A5. There were small Roman stations along this route and the most important settlement locally was Pennocrucium, which had an outlying fort. The name Pennocrucium is clearly associated with Penkridge, the town and parish north of Brewood, which is separated from it by the line of Watling Street, and these important remains do lie just outside the parish boundary. However, the remains of a small Roman villa have been found about 500m south of Watling Street, close to Engleton,Victoria County History ‚Äì A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 5: East Cuttlestone hundred, L. Margaret Midgley (editor), 1959, chapter 8 and so within Brewood parish. Clearly there was a small population in the Brewood area in Roman times, and quite possibly earlier. However, there is no evidence of continuity at any of the main settlements in present-day Brewood. The history of Brewood really begins with the Anglo-Saxon settlement, when it emerged as a village within Mercia. The place name suggests that it came into existence during the earlier part of the Anglo-Saxon period, when there were still people in the area of Celtic language and culture. However, the first real documentation comes after the Norman conquest of England. At the Domesday survey, in 1086, Brewood fell within the Cuttlestone Hundred of Staffordshire. The survey records that it was held by the Bishop of Chester and that it had been a church property before 1066. However, the landholder of the manor of Brewood in the Middle Ages is generally stated to be the Diocese of Lichfield. This is not a contradiction, but reflects the shifts in the seat of the diocese. In 1075, Peter, bishop of Lichfield, had transferred his see to Chester, and there it remained until 1102, when it moved to Coventry. From 1228, the official title was the Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Brewood was assessed for tax purposes as 5 hides, the hide being notionally an area of 120 acres, although at this time it had become simply a unit of tax liability, irrespective of actual area. Domesday also records Brewood as consisting of enough land for 20 ploughs. The bishop had twenty slaves cultivating his land in the village. The rest of the population consisted of 24 villagers, 18 smallholders and a priest. There were two mills, presumably on the River Penk. There was also a substantial area of woodland, tending to confirm the accepted etymology. However Domesday records that the value of the village was ¬£10 in 1066, and had halved in the twenty years since. Hence we can be sure that it had prospered in the late Anglo-Saxon period but had suffered a check to its growth during, and perhaps because of, Norman rule. =Development of a town= Norman rule brought Forest Law to the area, and it was not until 1204, in the reign of King John, that Brewood Forest was abolished. A forest was a royal hunting reserve, not necessarily wooded. The area of the parish to the east of the Penk was not part of Brewood Forest, but belonged to the Forest of Cank or Cannock Chase. It was not deforested until about a century later.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.1. Shortly after deforestation, in 1221, a charter for a Friday market at Brewood was granted to the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield by King Henry III, suggesting considerable growth and increased prosperity since the Domesday survey. However, the charter was valid only until the seniority of the king, who was a child at the time. The market continued, nevertheless, and the king recognised a Monday market too in 1259, as well as granting the right to hold an annual fair over the feast of the Nativity of Mary, or 7‚Äì9 September, although it was transferred to 19 September after the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar in the 18th century. In 1382 the burgesses of Stafford tried to get Brewood's markets suppressed, claiming that they had been unlicensed for twenty years and injured their trade. However, Stafford lost to Brewood and both market and fair were confirmed some time around 1390, in the reign of Richard II. The market petered out during the 18th century, and competition from Wolverhampton killed off an attempted revival in the following century. Although a general fair, the most important trade at the annual event was in horses. It continued until after World War I.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.2. From the mid-12th century, two religious communities of women developed in the Brewood area. The priory of St Mary, Brewood, generally known as Blackladies, was a Benedictine house, to the west of the village. It owned land and property around Brewood, and elsewhere in Staffordshire and Shropshire. The nuns petitioned Pope Gregory IX (1227‚Äì41) for protection, and he confirmed them in all their present and future holdings. He conferred the right to elect their own prioress and decreed that their flocks and herds were to be free of tithes. However, the nuns seems to have struggled financially, and they often solicited small gifts of cash from notables and even from kings. For example, in 1241 Henry III sent a gift of one mark so that they could redeem their pawned chalice. Even more telling was an incident of 1286. About ten years previously, a stag had escaped from the royal huntsman in Gailey Hay (then part of the forest of Cannock) and subsequently drowned in Blackladies' fishpond. The nuns split the carcass with John Giffard of Chillington. When the case came to court, Giffard received a fine and a prison sentence but the nuns were pardoned because of their poverty. However, there were criticisms of the financial management at the priory. In 1326, Roger Northburgh, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, made a visitation and demanded that the prioress present proper accounts, which she seemed unable to do, and that the cellaress and steward be dismissed. It seems that the community was always very small, and as dissolution approached it never numbered above four, although with a number of lay staff.VCH Staffordshire, volume 3, chapter 12, s.1. Ruins of White Ladies Priory, just west of Bishops Wood, viewed from the north-east. White Ladies Priory was an Augustinian house It was situated in an extra- parochial area adjoining Brewood parish to the west, and allocated to Shropshire, but it was generally styled the priory or convent of St Leonard of Brewood. The complement here was also small: generally five canonesses and the prioress. It too was poor and had scattered holdings in Shropshire, and even in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. Nevertheless, a visitation of 1338 by the zealous Bishop Northburgh led to censure of the prioress for her extravagant dress and for her hunting with hounds.VCH Shrophire, volume 2, p. 83. Both White Ladies and Blackladies were suppressed in the first wave of the Dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII and their buildings and local estates ended up in the hands of the Giffard family. Around the same time that the market was established, building of the large sandstone church of St Mary and St Chad was commenced, probably replacing a less impressive earlier church. It has undergone numerous alterations and restorations, but it was clearly a large and impressive structure from the outset. Around 1176, the bishop had conferred the church on the deanery of Lichfield Cathedral. The deans kept advowson, the right to nominate the priest until 1868. In medieval England, the local priest, in this case titled the vicar from 1275, was not a salaried official but a feudatory, dependent on a benefice designed to support him in office and owing service to his patron, the dean, in return. The vicar was to receive the altar dues and various other revenues, including mortuary dues and tithes on wool ‚Äì with the notable exception of wool from the dean's flock, of course. In return, he was to pay the dean a pension of 10 marks. The most notable of the medieval vicars was William de Pecco, who showed a shrewd eye for economic advantage. He somehow persuaded the nuns of Blackladies to let him impose a tithe on sheep and lambs that belonged to other people but were kept on their land ‚Äì a long-standing matter of dispute between the parish and the nunnery. He also exchanged parcels of land with John de Horsbrok to rationalise the vicarage lands, and arranged to pay John and his successors the small annual rent of 3d. to site the vicarage bakehouse on his land.VCH Staffs, volume 5, chapter 9, s.1. Apparently the financial position of the vicars fluctuated wildly. The vicarage was supposed to be worth ¬£6 17s. 8d. in 1535, but in 1604 the vicar received an income of about 100 marks, despite the fact that he was described as \\"no preacher, a notable swearer and drunkard\\". In 1646, after the first round of the English Civil War the living was valued at a mere ¬£20 and the vicar was bailed out by Parliament's Committee for Plundered Ministers, which gave him ¬£50 from the sequestered estates of the dean and ¬£8 from those of John and Peter Giffard at White Ladies and Blackladies. In the early 18th century the vicarage needed another subvention, this time from Queen Anne's Bounty, a fund designed to aid the poorest Anglican clergy.

The grammar school building, now incorporated into the Church of England Middle School, in School Road. Most of the building dates from a reconstruction of 1856. Speedwell Castle An unusual feature of the area was the presence of sulphur wells, at Chillington and Gunstone.VCH Staffordshire, volume 5, chapter 8, s.1. The latter seems to have had a leper house: there is a farm with this name today at Gunstone and the Ordnance SurveyOS map of Leper House area, Gunstone. records a Leper Well on the banks of the Moat Brook close by. Sulfurous water was a medieval, actually ineffective, remedy for leprosy. Leprosy or Hansen's disease was common in medieval Europe and seems to have reached a peak between the mid-12th and mid-14th centuries. The Third Lateran Council decreed segregation for lepers in special leper houses.Ann G. Carmichael: Leprosy: Larger than life, in Kenneth F. Kiple (ed): Plague, Pox and Pestilence, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1997, p.52. These were generally under monastic supervision. Leprosy declined rapidly until it faded from consciousness after the Black Death,William H. McNeill: Plagues and Peoples, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1977, p.175-177. but the waters were still used by people and animals suffering from skin ailments in the late 17th century. Brewood Grammar School was founded in the town in the reign of Elizabeth I, replacing a chantry school founded in the previous century and dissolved when all chantries were suppressed in 1547. Richard Hurd, educated at the school by William Budworth in the 1730s, and later to become a Bishop of Worcester, was one of the most notable students. The market, the grand church and the grammar school mark out Brewood as a small town, not just a village, by the standards of this period, and it was sometimes referred to as the Borough of Brewood. Around 1680, the township had about 60 houses, but this had grown to 210 houses, with a population of 919 by 1811.Victoria County History ‚Äì A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 5: East Cuttlestone Hundred, L. Margaret Midgley (editor), 1959, chapter 8. In 1834 William White described Brewood as \\"a small but well-built market town, with several good streets and a spacious market-place.\\"William White, History, Gazetteer and Directory of Staffordshire, Sheffield, 1834 The historic centre consisted of the market place, with Bargate, Newport and Stafford Streets, and Sandy Lane meeting at it. Dean Street, south-east of the church was another important old street. These still contain many houses of considerable age, mostly Georgian, but with many also from the 16th and 17th centuries. They form a large proportion of the many listed buildings in the parish of Brewood and Coven.Listed Buildings in Brewood and Coven at English Heritage. Speedwell Castle, in Bargate, is a striking eighteenth-century house said to have been built from the proceeds of a bet on a horse. In the early 19th century the parish consisted of eight liberties or constablewicks: Brewood town, Chillington, Coven, Engleton, Gunstone and the Hattons, Horsebrook, Kiddemore, and Somerford. The liberties outside the township were mainly based on the old medieval manors of the parish, centred on the seats of local landowners of note and influence. The fortunes of these varied considerably over the centuries. By the early 19th century, Coven had grown considerably and was described as \\"a considerable village\\" by William White in 1851.William White, History, Gazetteer and Directory of Staffordshire, Sheffield, 1851. Chillington, on the other hand, had been a village of about 30 houses in the 17th century but had declined to a collection of five farms by 1834. =The traditional economy= Brewood was the centre of an essentially agricultural community throughout the Middle Ages and well into modern times. Under the feudal manorial system, a large proportion of the land was held in return for service. Typically, peasant farmers, some of them unfree serfs and villeins, worked strips of land in open fields, which they held in return for services rendered to the lord ‚Äì generally including labour service on his land. This was essentially a subsistence system, with any surplus consumed locally by the lord and his entourage, who often travelled regularly between his various estates. Such a system certainly formed part of the medieval economy of Brewood. The bishop's land in Brewood was farmed on a three-field system in the 14th century, and probably much earlier. By the late 17th century we find various field throughout the parish subject to piecemeal enclosure. They include Shurgreave Hill Field, Hargreave Field, Eachells (or Nechells) Field and Burgage Field in the manor of Brewood. There were also Quarry Field and Church Field, apparently shared by the bishop's manor and the deanery manor, as well as Cross Field, Mill Field, Street Field, and Butts Field in the vill of Horsebrook, a part of the bishop's manor. In Coven manor we find Broadmeadow Field, Fulmore Field, and 'Rycrofte', all still open fields at the end of the 16th century, although only the first was still farmed in this way by the mid-17th century.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.5. However, there was clearly a good deal of variety in the way the land was let and worked. The bishops leased most of the land to other magnates, who established a number of separate manors and vills throughout the parish, each with its own pattern of exploitation. As early as 1297, lands left by Sir John Giffard in the vills of Chillington and La Hyde included a house and gardens, surrounded by 80 acres under wheat and 40 acres under rye, with 12 acres of woodland and pasture and rents from free and villein tenants. This sounds like large-scale farming for the market by the landowner, as well as subsistence cultivation by the peasants, and the fact that Sir John preferred at least some of his dues in rents suggests that he was using some paid workers instead of inefficient compulsory labour. As time passes we hear more and more of farmers, like the Pendrells and the Careless family, who rented integral areas of various sizes from the landlords to cultivate. In 1851, William White reported that Brewood parish contained 6718 acres of arable land, 4040 of pasturage, and 1090 of woods, etc.. It is impossible to know how this compares with earlier centuries, but it is likely that the area was always mainly arable, but with a good proportion of pasturage, as this suits the conditions. Among the most valuable resources in the medieval economy were the watermills, which the lords' tenants were generally compelled to use, either by law or of necessity. The mills were very profitable and the water power on which they depended constituted could become an important point of conflict. The two mills held by the bishop in 1086 were probably those at Engleton and Somerford, and these were certainly the most important and contested mills in the parish for many centuries, although there were a number of others on minor streams. The mills were leased to tenants, sometimes the holder of the surrounding land, but sometimes to an independent speculator. In either case, the miller, usually the butt of peasant complaints and humour, was simply an employee of the lessee. Both owners and lessees guarded the water supply fiercely. In 1318 Ralph de Coven leased Coven mill to John de Aldenham, together with the homage and services of Walron the miller, John, his son. By 1337, the bishop was complaining that John de Aldenham had diverted the Saredon Brook for his own purposes, greatly reducing the capacity of Somerford Mill. Almost three centuries later, in 1623, Francis Somerford, who now operated the same mill, was making a similar complaint: this time a new forge further up the Penk was reducing water power.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.6. Francis Somerford's complaint was not only that the forge stole his water supply, but that it had also flooded the surrounding meadows (presumably by use of a dam or weir), and that his family was disturbed \\"by the usual knocking thereof at several times of the night\\", and by \\"the unwholesome smoke, sparks and air . . . and by the ill neighbourhood of disordered and ill-disposed persons usually employed in and repairing unto such iron-works\\". This dispels any notion of a rural idyll. Brewood was, in fact, the centre of considerable, and often noisome, industry from an early date. By the 18th century, timber sales and a tannery brought their own particular smells and noise, as well as employment, to the town, and in 1817 the chief industry was reckoned to be manufacture of agricultural machinery. Both Brewood and Coven also had locksmiths, a speciality also of nearby Wolverhampton and Willenhall. The forge on the Penk seems to have used a water mill to power its bellows and hammers. This was nothing new, but a medieval technology. The lord of the manor of Brewood was letting out a forge by 1485 and there was probably iron production and working in the woodlands ‚Äì a pattern very similar to that in nearby areas where rivers ran close by woods that could supply charcoal, as along the Smestow and the Stour. The forge that so annoyed Somerford was built by Thomas Chetwynd of Rugeley and Walter Coleman of Cannock in 1620. A forge in Brewood Park was rented from the Giffard family from the mid-17th century by Thomas Foley (1616‚Äì1677) and Philip Foley (1648‚Äì1716), perhaps the most famous ironmasters of their period in the West Midlands. In 1717 there were two forges operating in the parish, with a combined output of 100 tons. However, decline had set in by mid- century, with a forge closing in 1753 and the other shortly after.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.1. By this time, Brewood was living in the shadow of an industrial revolution that transformed the nearby Severn valley, Wolverhampton and the Black Country, but largely passed it by. Abraham Darby I's work in developing coke-fired blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale slowly changed the whole pattern of iron working, moving it towards the coal fields and away from the woods. =Local magnates= Sir John Giffard.

Memorial to Mathew and Sarah Moreton (top) and Edward and Margery Moreton (lower panel), members of an important Staffordshire and Cheshire landowning family, in St Mary's and St Chad's church. Brewood and the area around it were dominated for centuries by families belonging mainly to the landed gentry, a social class basing its economic, social and cultural power on control over landed estates, but generally not so powerful or influential as the aristocracy. Tracing the ownership of estates in Brewood, it is apparent that there was a great influx of new blood among the landowners in the early 14th century, and that this new group begins to peter out in the 18th century. This neatly brackets the period of gentry dominance, not only in Brewood, but in England generally. The beginning of the period is marked by the end of feudalism in the wake of the Black Death, and a transition to tenant farming and wage labour. The period ends with a prolonged period of crisis, culminating in the Long Depression, that creates the modern countryside. The only major landowning dynasty to survive in Brewood through all these transitions of the medieval and modern periods were the Giffard family, whose main local seat was, and still is, Chillington Hall, about three miles south-west of the village centre. Their connection with Chillington has been traced back to before 1175: around that date, the then lord of the manor, Peter Corbesun, transferred it to his wife's nephew, Peter Giffard. By the 17th century, the Giffards held the manor of Brewood itself and land in most other parts of the parish. Politically, the family's influence reached a peak with Sir John Giffard, who died in 1556. He was five times Sheriff of Staffordshire and was appointed Ranger of the Seven Hays of the Forest of Cank, i.e. Cannock Chase. For some years a member of the household of Henry VIII and he accompanied the king to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. After Sir Thomas, his son, died only four years later, Recusancy impeded the family's political ambitions, but less so their financial acumen. The Giffards were major donors to Brewood's large parish church of St Mary and St Chad, although they had little control over it because of the power of the deanery. The choir of the church contains a number of elaborate alabaster tombs, surmounted by effigies of important family members of the 15th ‚Äì 17th centuries. One of these, Sir John Giffard, built a substantial mansion at Chillington, probably in the 1540s. Some improvements were made in the early 18th century, to the design of Francis Smith of Warwick, and around 1786 work began on the present Chillington Hall, designed by Sir John Soane ‚Äì a large Neo-Classical structure, which incorporates Smith's earlier work. At the dissolution of the monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII, the Giffards purchased the buildings and lands of both Blackladies, a Benedictine convent just west of Brewood, and White Ladies Priory, an Augustinian convent, about three miles west of the village, in Shropshire. Both were adapted for residential use. On the land of White Ladies, a short distance north of the former priory buildings, they adapted a farmhouse into a hunting lodge, which they named Boscobel House. The name signifies \\"beautiful woods\\", and originally stood in woodland, although it is also reminiscent of the family's Norman ancestor. The Giffards also held lands in other parts of the parish, sometimes intertwined with those of other important local landowners. The Lane family of Bentley Hall had considerable holdings and influence in the Brewood area, starting in the early 15th century. At Broom Hall, north-west of Brewood town, they held land from the early 15th century. By the 16th, the Giffards also held land here and let some of it to the Careless family. In 1715, the Giffards and Lanes agreed to an amicable re-allocation of land so that they could exploit it more efficiently.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.3. Another important Lane family holding was at the Hyde, between Brewood and Chillington, which they acquired at the same time as Broom Hall and owned until the late 18th century. They also acquired land at Coven from the 1430'3, gradually replacing the Coven family, the original Norman landowners, but selling to the Wrottesley family, from the Tettenhall area, in the early 18th century. The Moreton family, who originated in Moreton, Gnosall and had considerable estates in Staffordshire, first appear at Engleton, on the Penk, in the mid-16th century. By the late 17th century, with the Giffards isolated by Recusancy, the Moretons were the most important lay presence in the parish church, marked by a magnificent memorial for Mathew and Sarah Moreton. Their grandson, Matthew Ducie Moreton (1663‚Äì1735), went a stage further, being elevated to the peerage as 1st Baron Ducie. However, the estate passed to a junior branch of the family in the 18th century and was sold to Edward Monckton in 1811. Monckton was a younger son of John Monckton, 1st Viscount Galway (1695‚Äì1751) and the brother of the distinguished soldier and colonial administrator Robert Monckton. He was already a major landowner in the area, a nabob whose fortune came from his adventures and trading deals in India. Around 1779, he had acquired Somerford Hall, due west of Brewood, and always an important centre of influence locally. Long held by the Somerford family, who first appear in the 1120s, Somerford passed through the hands of Sir Walter Wrottesley, the third Baronet of the same name, in the early 18th century. Robert Barbor, a wealthy lawyer, who held it for a time after the Wrottesleys, built a substantial Georgian house. Monckton remodelled and enlarged the house, garnishing it with Adam style features. His wealth gave him great influence and he was able to reshape the landscape to his requirements. The road to Wolverhampton passed straight through the Somerford grounds, which Monckton was reforesting and improving. At a hotly contested vestry meeting in 1781 he tried to have it routed further south, to cross the Penk at Somerford Mill. It emerged that this would throw the expenses of construction and maintenance on the parish. So Monckton agreed to divert it to the north of his property and paid to construct a new section to Four Ashes, on the main turnpike road between Wolverhampton and Stafford.Victoria County History, volume 5 chapter 8. =Recusancy and dissent= William and Mary in Brewood parish church. These were displayed by law in all churches after the Glorious Revolution, when the English Penal Laws against both Catholics and Protestant dissenters were in full force. Like many of the Staffordshire and Shropshire gentry, the Giffard family remained Catholic Recusants throughout the Reformation and the English Civil War, sheltering priests and hearing mass in their houses, despite continuing to be buried in ornate tombs in the chancel of the Anglican parish church for four generations of religious turmoil and persecution. John Giffard, who held Chillington in the reign of Elizabeth I came into direct confrontation with the monarch. Elizabeth stayed at Chillington on the night of 11 August 1575 and was able to see for herself that he did not attend Anglican worship, despite having promised to do so. On this occasion he was fined, but five years later he was imprisoned. John's son, Walter, maintained the family's support for the Catholic cause in the reign of James I. Hoping that the Stuart monarchs would relax some of the discrimination they suffered, the Giffard family took the royalist side in the Civil Wars. Andrew Giffard of Chillington was killed in a skirmish, fighting for Charles I. The network of alliances and patronage among the gentry of Brewood played a pivotal role in the escape of Charles II after his defeat by Parliamentary forces at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Most famously, White Ladies Priory and Boscobel House, together with nearby Moseley Old Hall, provided refuge for Charles as he sought a way out of the West Midlands. It was at Boscobel that the king hid from his pursuers in an oak tree, as well as in one of the priest holes inside the building. The king was cared for by members of the Pendrell or Penderel family, who rented land and had a farm on the Boscobel estate ‚Äì . He was accompanied in the oak by another recusant Catholic native of Brewood, Colonel William Careless of Broom Hall. Finally, Charles was spirited away from the Midlands mainly by the efforts of Jane Lane of Bentley, whose family were major landowners in Brewood, although Protestant and formerly supporters of Parliament. The Giffards were deprived of most of their property by Parliament and recovered it only on the Restoration of Charles II. Charles publicised the role of those local Catholics who aided his escape and a not entirely reliable account of his adventures by Thomas Blount, published after his Restoration in 1660, was actually entitled Boscobel.Blount's Boscobel at Internet Archive Thomas Blount: Boscobel or the History of His Sacred Majesties Most Miraculous Preservation. Available in various formats at Internet Archive, this is the earliest, not entirely reliable account, of the escape of Charles II, published shortly after the Restoration in 1660. Gentry support kept the number of Catholics in Brewood relatively high. The figure was given as 74 in 1641 and a very considerable 399 in 1780. Most of the Giffards' tenants and servants were Catholic until the mid-19th century.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 6, s.2. One of Andrew Giffard's sons, Bonaventure Giffard (1642‚Äì1734), was the Roman Catholic Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District of England from 1687 until 1703 ‚Äì effectively the first Roman Catholic bishop of the area after the Reformation ‚Äì and he was assisted by his brother, another Andrew, also a bishop. These were the first steps towards rebuilding the Catholic hierarchy in England after the Reformation The Catholic community at Brewood used the chapel at Chillington for baptisms and weddings from about 1721, but it was demolished to make way for the enlargement of the house around 1786. After that they used the chapel at Blackladies, which became effectively a church for the community, with two priests. In 1727, while Catholics were still prohibited from opening public places of worship, the building of Giffard House was commenced in the centre of Wolverhampton. Purportedly a town residence for the family, it was actually a chapel for the Catholic population of the area ‚Äì the first urban place of worship built for the Roman Catholic Church since the Reformation. In the 19th century, after Catholic Emancipation, the Giffard family were able to give lavishly and publicly to local Catholic causes. Most importantly, they gave the land and subsidised the priest's stipend for the Roman Catholic Church of St Mary in Brewood itself. This was one of fourteen buildings in Staffordshire designed by Augustus Welby Pugin and promoted by John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury, in the period 1836‚Äì48, as part of a campaign to revive and consolidate Catholicism in the region. It is in Pugin's characteristic Gothic Revival style and was opened in 1844. It stands on land formerly belonging to Blackladies, overlooking the canal. However, from this time, the influence of the gentry in English Catholicism was on the wane, as immigration from Ireland brought large Catholic working class communities to towns like Wolverhampton, making it an urban faith. Meanwhile, the struggle of Protestant dissenters to establish themselves in Brewood was even harder. Without gentry support, they seem to have been led mostly townspeople of some education but little money, probably shopkeepers and artisans. George Whitefield's Calvinist Methodist preachers visited the town in 1745. However, when the eminent Nonconformist preacher George Burder tried to address a meeting in a barn in 1775, it was attacked by a mob. Several houses were certified for dissenters' meetings over the years, but none of the communities seems to have lasted long. The first sign of real progress came after 1800, when John Simpson, the parish clerk defected from the Anglican church. By 1803, he had persuaded his brother-in-law, James Neale, a Londer dissenter, to pay for a small Congregationalist chapel, which was built in Sandy Lane. The little community grew, aided by holiday working parties of students from New College at Hackney, a dissenting academy, and the chapel had to be extended in 1825 and rebuilt in 1842. After this, the Methodists too got a foothold in the area. The first Wesleyan chapel was built at Coven in 1828 and replaced with a bigger building in 1839. In 1831, William Holland, a Brewood lock-maker, and his brother George got their house certified as a meeting house, with a congregation of three. They persevered and by 1851 they were using part of a house in Shop Lane, moving to an 80-seater Primitive Methodist chapel in Pendryl Avenue seven years later. In 1868, the Wesleyans too opened a chapel in Brewood.VCH Staffordshire, volume 5, chapter 9, s.3. Gradually the old consensuses in religion, as in much else, were breaking down as the countryside entered a period of dislocation and change. =The Victorian crisis= Brewood in the early 19th century still seemed a hive of economic activity. These were good times for agriculture, with the Napoleonic Wars and the Corn Laws protecting producers against foreign competition. From the 1840s, things changed for the worse. Since there are reliable statistics for this period, based on the UK Census it is fairly easy to chart the decline. Population graph, 1801‚Äì1961 The 1831 census marks a peak in population for the Brewood parish of 3799. After that date, there is decline for the rest of the century, and only a modest recovery in the 20th century.Population figures for Brewood CP/AP at A Vision of Britain through Time In fact, the 1831 peak was not surpassed until the housing boom of the 1950s, even the expansion of the parish in 1934 failing to lift the population by much. The fall in the male population throughout the Victorian period is particularly significant. There were 2099 males in 1831, although this was unusually high, perhaps because this was the year canal building commenced at Brewood. The figures for 1841 and 1851 hover around 1800, but this plunges to 1180 in 1901. The female population was much steadier, reaching a peak in 1851, and outnumbering the male from that point onwards.Males & Females statistics for Brewood CP/AP at A Vision of Britain Through Time One of the results of population decline was a proliferation of empty houses. In 1831 only six of the 699 houses in the parish were unoccupied. In 1891, 84 houses out of 630 stood vacant ‚Äì about 13.3% or more than one in eight.House occupancy for Brewood CP/AP at A Vision of Britain through Time Figures for employment in various occupations are generally hard to interpret, as definitions changed through the century. However, it is relatively easy to extract those for agriculture. The 1831 census found that the parish had 377 adult male agricultural labourers and 76 farmers, of whom about half were employers of labour, while the rest presumably relied on their own family. This gives a total of 453 men directly earning their living on the land.Industry for Brewood CP/AP at A Vision of Britain Through Time, transcribed by David Allan Gatley, Staffordshire University The 1881 census gives a more detailed analysis under so-called occupational orders, but this mainly affects industrial occupations. Adult male agricultural employment is stated simply as 317, although the women agricultural workers are now also numbered ‚Äì at just three.Industry for Brewood CP/AP at A Vision of Britain through Time, transcribed by David Allan Gatley, Staffordshire University Almost a third of jobs on the land have gone in 50 years, and it is a process that can only continue. Not only did the Long Depression grip world agriculture for almost a quarter of a century, but any relief was slight and temporary. After World War I, the even deeper Great Depression was to place more pressure on agriculture. Moreover, there were changes in farming techniques that tended to drive down employment even when the market was good. Boscobel House has a good selection of late Victorian and early 20th century far machinery. Still horse-powered, it is nevertheless ingenious and substantial, and manufactured already in the Uttoxeter area or along the Humber, not locally. It had the power to displace many labourers. A simple potato plough, for example, could harvest several acres a day, undermining the bargaining power of labourers at precisely the time of year when it was traditionally strongest, and starving families of the little extra, often earned by women and children, that cleared debts and kept their heads above water. When less successful farmers sold out to the more efficient, the effect was irreversible: employers did not sacrifice efficiencies of scale when the times were better. By 1940, eleven of the farms exceeded 150 acres ‚Äì very different from the small holdings of one and two centuries earlier ‚Äì and the full effects of mechanisation and scientific agriculture were yet to be felt. The canal viewed southward from Brewood. The wharves are still lined with boats, but nearly all are leisure craft. Thomas Telford's Stretton Aqueduct carrying the Shropshire Union Canal over the A5 The canal below the Roman Catholic , viewed northward from the bridge at Brewood There were many signs of decline to confirm this overall pattern. The weekly market had ceased and the market cross fell down in 1810. Attempts to revive it came to nothing in the face of growing prosperity elsewhere.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.2. Iron working disappeared altogether, and the other industries declined. Malting gave employment in mid-century, but soon followed the other trades into decline. Other improvements arrived too late or gave too little. Work began on the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal (now the Shropshire Union Canal) in 1830, but progress was slow and it was not opened until 1843. It passed north to south straight through the parish, with large wharves on the western edge of Brewood itself and at Chillington. The large Belvide Reservoir supplied water to the canal and also provided fishing. However, the great days of canals were already over: although it brought some welcome employment and trade, especially during the early phases of its construction, it did not stimulate the long-term growth Brewood needed. The railway, much more revolutionary in its impact, merely grazed the parish, with a station at Four Ashes and two trains a day initially ‚Äì essentially a commuter route from the very beginning. Brewood needed a station of its own to fire commerce. An extension of the railway from Bushbury to Brewood was in the planning stage in 1874, but it never happened. This decline contrasts strongly with the national pattern. While agriculture was in trouble everywhere, industrial and urban Victorian Britain was growing fast. Between 1831 and 1901, the population of Brewood fell from almost 3800 to just over 2500Population for Brewood CP/AP at A Vision of Britain Through Time. a reduction of about a third ‚Äì perhaps a little exaggerated by the presence of migrant navvies at the earlier date. In the same period the population of England as a whole soared from just under 13 million. Census of 1831 at A Vision of Britain Through Time. C.f. Population Abstract, transcribed by David Allan Gatley. to about 32.5 million1901 census report at A Vision of Britain Through Time ‚Äì almost two and a half times the size. Even nearby villages in Staffordshire outperformed Brewood. Wombourne, for example, had a rising population through most of the Victorian period and only saw a falling back during the worst of the Long Depression.Population for Wombourn CP/AP at A Vision of Britain Through Time. Most importantly, of course, the nearby industrial town of Wolverhampton doubled its population from about 47,000 to 94.000Population for Wolverhampton Town/CP/AP at A Vision of Britain Through Time. ‚Äì a figure which leaves out of account its growing suburbs. Clearly there was population drift from Brewood ‚Äì probably towards the much greater employment opportunities of the industrial towns, like Wolverhampton and the Black Country. In 1872, the curfew bell, which had been rung each winter evening since the Middle Ages, ceased. Within two years even the Sunday \\"Pudding Bell\\" and the Shrove Tuesday \\"Pancake Bell\\" had followed it into memory. It seemed that the countryside was falling silent. This was not the case throughout the parish. At its extremities, there were considerable signs of life. In both cases, a local landowning family played an important part in promoting and consolidating the facilities needed by a growing community. To the west it was the Evans family, who had bought Boscobel, initially as a holiday home. Once established, they fell in love with the place and did much to elaborate the legend of Boscobel as a royalist shrine. They also put a great deal of money into the new community of Bishops Wood, which adjoined their property. At the eastern edge of the parish, the Monckton family, with their combination of business acumen and philanthropic zeal, helped save the situation. In the 1724 century, Bishops Wood had no human inhabitants ‚Äì only a rabbit warren leased by the Giffards to one John Blakemore. and a few animals grazed there. In the early 19th century it was still just pasture land, but in 1844, the Diocese and the lessee, T.W. Giffard, agreed to enclose it.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.4. It proved immediately popular with those, both inside and outside the parish, who wanted to create a new home or a smallholding. Within a decade, this former waste place needed a church of its own to accommodate its Anglican residents. Coven had already received a great stimulus from the improvement of communications. The main road between Wolverhampton and Stafford, which passed very close to Coven, was turnpiked under an Act of 1760. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal was built between 1768 and 1772, passing very close to Coven, and bringing into existence the hamlet of Coven Heath, just beyond the southern boundary of the parish at that point. Both of these were vast improvements in their day. Coven was brought much closer to the growing urban centres of the Industrial Revolution, just as Brewood town was passed by. As a result, most of the growth in population and the new housing within the parish, through to the early 20th century, appeared either at Coven or along the Kiddemore Green Road to Bishops Wood, not in Brewood itself. Just north of Coven, Four Ashes, originally just a pub fronted by four ash trees, grew into a small distinct settlement, boosted not just by increased traffic on the main road, but by Edward Monckton's diversion of the Brewood-Wolverhampton route. Significantly, Monckton either owned or soon bought, Four Ashes as part of his Somerford estate. From 1785, Four Ashes was visited every night by the Birmingham- Liverpool mail coach, and from 1810 the Bristol-Manchester mail coach called each day. Brewood acquired a coach stop, on the London to Liverpool run, only later, and that needed extra horses to get it over the bad road through Bishops Wood to Watling Street. Not surprisingly, a rival operator soon opened up a route through Four Ashes and Gailey, by-passing the old town. The arrival of the railway killed most of Four Ashes' coach connections but gave the eastern edge of the parish a huge advantage that the centre could not match. Four Ashes was to evolve into the main industrial zone of the area. Such were changes in population distribution and economic activity that ran alongside the general decline, and ran against it in defined localities. They redrew the map of Brewood, creating the three-centred structure which persists to this day. Education was the main focus for philanthropic efforts. The origins of the present Church of England primary school in Brewood lie in a scheme to set up an Anglican National School drawn up in 1816 and already in the process of implementation two years later. By 1834, several decades before primary education became compulsory, about 140 were being schooled by subscription, and the roll was around 110 in 1851, with a master and a mistress to teach them. In 1870, the school's finances received a welcome boost in the form of a bequest of ¬£2000 from Revd. Henry Kempson, formerly headmaster of Brewood Grammar School. Meanwhile, the Evans family had paid to start both primary education for Catholic children at Blackladies and a National School at Bishops Wood: in fact, Miss Evans actually taught at the latter. The Monckton family too supported a dame school for their tenants' and workers' children at Somerford, before George Monckton switched their support to growing Coven, where a National School accompanied the new St Paul's church, largely built at the Monckton's expense.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 9, s.4. =Evolution of a residential village= While it is true that Brewood was considered a town in the past and a village today, it is also true that it has a much bigger population now than at any time in the past. This is almost entirely to a complete change of character in which Brewood and the other centres alike have evolved from places of work to places of residence. One of the paradoxes of the period of decline was that houses were being built all the time houses stood empty and others fell into decay. In fact the total number of houses stood up well, at above 700, throughout the Victorian period, before plunging to a recorded low of 615 in 1921.Total Houses for Brewood CP/AP at A Vision of Britain Through Time It seems that the drift to the towns was already partly balanced by building at and around Coven, as middle-class workers and professionals discovered they could live in the country but work in the town ‚Äì something made possible especially by the railway. In the 20th century, this residential growth became the central feature of Brewood's history ‚Äì especially after World War II, when rising general prosperity and the ubiquity of the motor car totally transformed the situation of the Village and the parish as a whole. Despite the general gloom of the late Victorian period, many features of modernity were not especially slow to arrive in Brewood. The town had its own gas works from about 1872 until around World War I, when Stafford council took over the supply. Mains electricity arrived in 1928, and was available throughout the parish by 1940. The Four Ashes Manufacturing Company opened its carbon works in the early 1920s, beginning the transformation of Four Ashes into an industrial zone that now stretches both sides of the main Wolverhampton-Stafford road. That road, now the A449 road, was turned into a dual carriageway between 1936 and 1939, responding to the increasing importance of motor vehicles. The majority of the muddy or stony lanes that had isolated so much of the parish, including Brewood itself, yielded to tarmac between the wars or shortly after. Road building gathered pace after World War II and Brewood was to find itself at a favoured corner of the motorway network ‚Äì albeit after long delays in planning and execution. The M6 motorway came around Stafford in 1962 but did not link to the M1 motorway until 1971. The M54 motorway was opposed by Staffordshire County Council and took a long time to complete. Nevertheless, in 1983 it opened, cutting through to Telford just to the south of Coven, a fast, modern link shadowing the ancient Watling Street. Already a new Birmingham North Relief Road was under discussion. Although the debate seemed interminable, when it finally arrived in the form of the M6 Toll motorway, construction was swift, with a start made in 2000 and the road in use by the end of 2003. After decades of stagnation the population of Brewood parish began to rise a little in the 1920s. After the War, the rise became rapid, and in the 1950s headlong. The recorded rise was from 3,576 in 1951 to 5,751 in 1961Population for Brewood CP/AP at A Vision of Britain Through Time ‚Äì more than 60% in a single decade. This was the result of large-scale housing development. While Coven continued to grow, Brewood sprouted a series of developments to the north-east, some built by the council and some private. This growth has continued to the present. The private car overcame all the obstacles in the way of growth but changed the entire nature of the place. The vast majority of residents now work outside the area. With the coming of the motorway network, the ease of commuting was greatly increased, bringing almost the whole of the West Midlands region within easy daily travel distance. Brewood todayTransport Brewood like Coven is served by a bus service to Wolverhampton and Stafford during the week and on Saturdays only. However the frequency is less than thirteen services each way to both Wolverhampton and Stafford. In terms of railway, Brewood's nearest active station is Penkridge. There was formerly a station in Gailey and Four Ashes. These both, however closed back in 1951 and 1959. The stations were both over three miles from the actual town itself. =Definition= The current Civil Parish of Brewood and Coven has a population of around 7,500, mostly grouped in four distinct villages: *Brewood *Bishops Wood *Coven *Coven Heath. The civil parish boundaries are based on those of the ancient parish of Brewood, which likewise included Coven and Bishop's Wood, although not Coven Heath. Despite the emergence of distinct civil and ecclesiastical parishes under the Victorian Poor Law, the civil parish remained almost identical to the ancient parish for more than a century. To this day, the only change, and a fairly minor one, is the addition of a small corner of neighbouring Bushbury parish, when the latter was absorbed into Wolverhampton in 1934. This brought Coven Heath and Brinsford into the parish. The entire ecclesiastical parish was served by the church of St Mary and St Chad, probably from Anglo-Saxon times and certainly from the 12th century, until the Victorian period. In 1852, Bishops Wood, to the west, was given its own chapelry, followed by the eastern hamlet of Coven in 1858. Coven, together with Coven Heath, evolved into and remained a separate ecclesiastical parish, served by St Paul's church. The remainder of the ancient parish is now a single ecclesiastical parish, served by the two churches of St Mary and St Chad, Brewood, and St John the Evangelist, Bishops Wood. =Governance= Brewood is part of a two-tier system of local government, with an additional parish community council. The top layer authority, to which Brewood and Coven elects a single representative, is Staffordshire County Council. This has differed greatly in the area it has covered, but Brewood has been part of it in all its manifestations since the Administrative County was established in 1889. The lower-tier authority, to which Brewood and Coven elects three representatives, is South Staffordshire District Council. This was formed in 1974 through the merger of Cannock Rural District and Seisdon Rural District. Brewood had been a part of Cannock Rural District since 1894, and was included in its predecessor, the Cannock Rural Sanitary District from its inception in 1875. Prior to this, Brewood was included in the East Cuttlestone Hundred of the Ancient County of Staffordshire. Brewood has had a parish council since time immemorial. Evolved from a vestry system of government by local notables in the early modern period, it became an elected Civil Parish council in Victorian times. It now has a community council which styles itself The Parish of Brewood and Coven with Bishops Wood and Coven Heath. =Politics= In UK parliamentary elections, Brewood and Coven forms a part of the South Staffordshire constituency. The local MP is the Conservative Gavin Williamson. From 1974 to 2010, the MP was the Conservative Sir Patrick Cormack. Brewood's representative on Staffordshire County Council is Rex Roberts OBE, Conservative. It is represented on South Staffordshire District Council by two Conservative councillors and one Independent councillor. =Features= Scania P94D appliance, outside Brewood Fire Station in October 2015 The Shropshire Union Canal passes through the western edge of Brewood (and over Stretton Aqueduct). The River Penk flows along the eastern edge. Belvide Reservoir, which feeds the canal, is about one kilometre to the north-west. There is a Brewood Civic Society and a Rotary Club of Brewood. Brewood is also the home of the Brewood Singers. The village came second in the South Staffordshire Best Kept Village 2005 challenge and has won the competition numerous times. Brewood is also home to the annual Brewood Cycle Challenge a popular cycle sportive taking place each June and the Brewood 10K Run each September. Jim Lea of Slade lives on the outskirts. Martin Gilks, drummer of the British pop band The Wonder Stuff, grew up in Brewood.

The Anglican parish church of Brewood is Saint Mary the Virgin and Saint Chad. It shares its dedication with Lichfield Cathedral, probably because the bishop was lord of the manor of Brewood. Veneration of The Virgin Mary was very important in the Middle Ages and many major churches contemporary with Brewood's parish church have this dedication, including Lincoln Cathedral and Notre Dame de Paris. St. Chad was the 7th century Northumbrian missionary most closely associated with the establishment of Mercian Christianity, and there are many medieval dedications to him in the West Midlands, including important churches at nearby Stafford, Pattingham and Shrewsbury. The present building was begun in sandstone in the early 13th century, in Early English style, probably on the site of an earlier church, perhaps a wooden Mercian structure. The aisles are wide, making the nave, which has five bays, very square in appearance. The present plan is probably very similar to the original 13th-century lay-out. The chancel is the part of the church that is structurally most similar to when it was first built. However, the remainder of the church has been altered so often and so substantially that it is impossible to be sure of its exact architectural history. Major changes took place in the 14th and 16th centuries, with the height of the nave being raised greatly, necessitating large alterations to the aisles. This greatly altered the cross-section of the building, with lean- to roofs on the aisles replacing the original gabled design. The Georgian period saw the most radical and least sympathetic alterations. At some point in the 18th century, the east wall of the chancel was rebuilt in brick, with Venetian windows installed. In the 1770s, amid great controversy in the parish vestry, major structural changes were forced through. First the roof was completely stripped off and a new one fitted, a single pitch construction which covered both the nave and its aisles, and which greatly reduced the height of the building. Then the north and south doors were stopped up, their porches demolished, and the west door adopted as the entrance. In 1815 the galleries were altered to take a new organ, and from 1827 to 1830, nearly all the old furnishings and fittings were ripped out and replaced, along with the font. Despite these changes the Victorian period saw more radical work, this time in the cause of restoration. At a cost of ¬£6600, the architect and restorer George Edmund Street directed a major operation between 1878 and 1880. The vandalised east wall of the chancel was rebuilt in stone, the roof returned to approximately its former height, with the pitched roof of the nave separated from those of the aisles, and the north vestry demolished. Street made a serious attempt to respect the 13th century plan of the building, although its cross section is now close to the 16th-century reconstruction. In many cases, he used the old stone in the restoration. Some new furnishings were bought around the same time, including a pulpit and choir stalls. However, even Street's restoration was not the end of the story. The tower was restored in 1890: the noted tower and spire have a peal of eight bells. In the early years of the 20th century much was done to make the church more usable and accessible. A screen used to provide a temporary vestry at the eastern end was removed and a reredos installed, placing the main altar in its proper place. Floors levels were changed and railings removed from the Giffard tomb, and the old font was recovered from a garden in Coven and reinstalled.VCH Staffordshire, volume 5, chapter 9, s. 1. The church has been a grade I listed building since 1962. The church has eight bells, made in 1896 by Taylors of Loughborough. The funding of ¬£1,000 for this \\"new\\" ring of bells was provided by a bequest from Charles Docker of Dean Street, Brewood. The bells are one of the first sets of bells to be tuned using the Scientific or \\"Simpson\\" tuning method which was developed through the late 1890s by Taylors. At a tenor weight of 21 CWT, they are considered one of the finest peals of eight bells in the Midlands. The church contains a large number of memorials, mainly of local gentry families. These include four large marble tombs of the Giffard family, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, as well as a fine monument to the members of the Moreton family, and a large memorial inscription for the Monckton family, the later members of the family being buried at Coven, though remembered here. Located to the rear of the church, next to an Oak Tree, is a small worn gravestone, a Victorian replacement for a lost original monument, marking the final resting place of Sir William Careless, a local Recusant who played an important part in the escape of Charles II from the parliamentary forces after the Battle of Worcester. The churchyard also contains the war graves of four soldiers of World War I and two of World War II. CWGC Cemetery Report. Breakdown obtained from casualty record. =Victorian Gothic= Three examples of Gothic Revival church building are to be found in the Brewood area. * The Roman Catholic church, dedicated to St. Mary, built in 1844 under the direction of Pugin, who donated three windows to it. The style is modelled on that of the late 13th century, with an open roof, an aisled nave, a lady chapel and a west tower with a small spire. The church contains a Madonna and child, thought to have sustained leg damage from a sword stroke during a search of Blackladies' by Parliamentary soldiers during the escape of Charles II. Once considered thaumaturgic,History page, St Mary's church website the wound was said to weep continually and the liquid was used to effect cures.VCH Staffordshire, volume 5, chapter 9, s. 2. The church has been a grade II listed building since 1974. *The Anglican church at nearby Bishops Wood is dedicated to St. John the Evangelist. The church was designed by George Thomas Robinson of Wolverhampton, who was regarded as a maverick architect, although this is regarded as one of his most successful buildings.Architects at Wolverhampton Local History Built 1848‚Äì50 and consecrated in 1851, it has a notable crossing beneath an open roof. Surrounded by monuments to local families, it has windows dedicated to several members of the Evans family, who lived at Boscobel and played a large part in developing Bishops Wood. *The Anglican church at Coven, dedicated to St. Paul, was consecrated in 1857. It was designed by another Wolverhampton architect, Edward Banks, who was responsible for designing or restoring many churches and also designed the famous Royal Hospital in the town. St. Paul's was largely financed by George Monckton, who died shortly after it opened and is commemorated in the east window. The style is strongly influenced by 13th-century Gothic. The churchyard contains the war graves of two soldiers of World War II. CWGC Cemetery Report. =Protestant Nonconformity= The oldest surviving purpose- built meeting places for Protestant nonconformists are Wesleyan in origin, although there were significant Congregationalist and Primitive Methodist groups in Brewood during the 19th century. A small Wesleyan chapel was opened at Coven in 1828, and in 1839 replaced by a larger structure in Lawn Lane, now Coven's Methodist church. At Brewood, a small brick chapel was opened in 1868. With pitched roof and round-arched windows, it is typical of its time: now extended considerably and painted white, it still serves as Brewood Methodist Church.VCH Staffordshire, volume 5, chapter 9, s. 3.

He was the younger brother of Bigga Haitian. Death The undercover police officer approached Dorismond and his friend as they were standing outside the \\"Distinguished Wakamba Cocktail Lounge\\" and asked him where he and his partners could purchase marijuana. One of the officers, Anthony Vasquez, shot Patrick Dorismond in the chest during a scuffle. The officers say the scuffle began when Dorismond became angry after they propositioned him, loudly declaring he was not a drug dealer. They state he threw a punch at a second officer and with his friend, Kevin Kaiser, began attacking him. Officer Vasquez said he came to his partner's aid, hearing one of the men yelling \\"Get his gun!\\", drew his weapon and identified himself as a police officer. He said Dorismond grabbed the gun, causing it to discharge into his chest. Dorismond's friend, Kevin Kaiser, says that neither of the officers identified themselves. He says he attempted unsuccessfully to pull Dorismond back from the confrontation. He described the first undercover cop who had approached Dorismond as aggressive and \\"in their face\\". Kaiser said it was one of the cops who initiated the fight, hitting Dorismond first. An ambulance arrived on the scene within minutes of the shooting and Dorismond was transported to St. Clare's Hospital where attempts to resuscitate him proved futile. The single bullet from Vasquez's 9mm pistol had struck Dorismond's aorta and his right lung, and he rapidly bled to death. Aftermath Much of the controversy over the Dorismond shooting revolved around then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani who was then in the midst of an abortive United States Senate campaign. His release of Dorismond's sealed juvenile delinquency record immediately after the shooting raised the ire of the African-American community as well as critics of the Mayor. The Mayor's office defended the release using the rationale that the right to privacy does not survive an individual's death. Giuliani also said that he only wanted to show that Dorismond was \\"no altar boy\\". Ironically, Dorismond had attended the same Catholic school as Giuliani and had indeed been an altar boy. Giuliani's actions became a hot-button issue in his Senate campaign against Hillary Clinton and cost him several points in the polls. Dorismond's funeral in Brooklyn was a highly emotional affair, marred by clashes between thousands of protestors and the NYPD. 23 police officers were injured, and several protesters were arrested as well. On July 27, 2000, a grand jury declined to indict Officer Vasquez in the death of Dorismond, announcing that they had found the shooting to be accidental. On March 12, 2003, the City of New York agreed to pay the Dorismond family $2.25 million to settle a suit filed on behalf of the family. In popular culture In 2000, the New York City feminist band Le Tigre released the song \\"Bang! Bang!\\" on their EP From the Desk of Mr. Lady as a critique of the incident. The song calls the police out on racial profiling. Kathleen Hanna sings: \\"Wrong fucking timeWrong fucking placeThere is no fucking wayThis is not about race\\". Immortal Technique commented on the incident in the song \\"The Other White Meat\\": Dorismond is the first name mentioned in the recitation \\"Rollcall For Those Absent\\", from the album The Imagined Savior is Far Easier to Paint (Blue Note, 2014) by jazz trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire.

Collectively, these laws make it illegal for contractors and subcontractors doing business with the federal government to discriminate in employment because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran. In addition, contractors and subcontractors are prohibited from discriminating against applicants or employees because they inquire about, discuss, or disclose their compensation or that of others, subject to certain limitations. Its regulations can be found at CFR Title 41 Chapter 60: Public Contracts and Property Management. Agency history 100px OFCCP, as it is today, was created in 1978 with Executive Order 12086 by President Jimmy Carter through a consolidation of all the Affirmative Action enforcement responsibilities at each federal agency with Executive Order 11246 to the United States Secretary of Labor. The origins of the agency trace back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and World War II when he signed Executive Order 8802, preventing discrimination based on race by government contractors. In 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the President‚Äôs Committee on Government Contracts with Executive Order 10479. The order was a follow-up to Executive Order 10308 signed by President Harry S. Truman in 1951 establishing the anti-discrimination Committee on Government Contract Compliance. In 1961 President Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925 which created the President‚Äôs Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. This called for people to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired and employees are treated during employment without regard to race, creed, color or national origin. On September 24, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed EO 11246 transferring responsibility for supervising and coordinating the Federal Contract Compliance from the President‚Äôs Committee to the Secretary of Labor who established the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCC). Executive Order 11375 by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 added sex discrimination to OFCCP‚Äôs mandate. In 1975 the name was changed from OFCC to OFCCP by President Gerald Ford. This reflected the addition of the responsibility to enforce laws prohibiting discrimination against the disabled and veterans.

The current bridge, built 1907-1909 at a cost of $63,000,http://www.fairoakshistory.org/bridge/bridge.htm is the third bridge at this location. The first bridge, which opened in 1901, helped to transform the small semi-rural community into a turn-of-the-century agricultural powerhouse. The present bridge, built 1907-1909, helped to transform the citrus colony into one of the leading bedroom communities of Sacramento by the 1940s. It is now a pedestrian and bicycle-only bridge. History19th- century background= Brevet Brigadier General Charles Henry Howard and James W. Wilson of the Howard-Wilson Publishing Company of Chicago acquired rights to sell land from California Senator Frederick K. Cox and businessman Crawford W. Clarke in 1895. The Howard-Wilson Company had the land surveyed and mapped and began to promote Fair Oaks as one of their \\"Sunset Colonies\\". The Howard- Wilson Company advertised Fair Oaks as an innovative and growing citrus colony after destructive freezes in Southern California and Florida and a national depression hitting in 1893. Many of the purchasers were professionals and other friends of the investors. Thus, the Fair Oaks community became initially composed of mostly businessmen and other professionals, including bankers and engineers. Three hundred permanent settlers resided in Fair Oaks by 1897 and bought land in 5, 10, and tracts at an average of $30 per acre. These pioneers planned to sustain themselves by planting and cultivating fruit orchards although the majority of them had little experience with farming. Promises of a bridge being built over the American River to better transport the new colony‚Äôs fruit to the booming markets in Sacramento and beyond further sustained this hope. The following year, however, investment began to diminish and the Howard-Wilson Company withdrew from the colony and with it went unfulfilled promises of a bridge over the American River and railroad service from Sacramento. Businessmen in Chicago and Sacramento who had an investment (land or fruit) in the newborn colony and Orangevale formed the Chicago-Fair Oaks Club in 1899. Local businessmen, including Valentine S. McClatchy (the co-owner of the Sacramento Bee), incorporated the Fair Oaks Development Company in 1900. These boosters shamelessly proclaimed Fair Oaks to be the \\"crown of the [Sacramento] valley\\", in the \\"heart of California\\". Together, in 1901, these two groups convinced the County of Sacramento‚Äôs Chamber of Commerce, which McClatchy‚Äôs business partners from Orangevale created and chaired, to build a bridge across the American River at Fair Oaks and persuaded the Southern Pacific Rail Road Company to build a railroad spur to the bridge. In the summer of 1901 the spur and railroad station were built. The station was named Fair Oaks Bridge Depot. The spur to the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad Co. helped Fair Oaks farmers and fruit companies prosper by enabling growers to distribute fresh fruit to a vast market. =Three bridges= Two of the three bridges. The third bridge is hidden behind the second. Fair Oaks grew rapidly with the completion of the Fair Oaks Bridge and the railroad line. This first Fair Oaks Bridge, however, was washed out in a flood in March 1907. An 850-foot steel cable was then borrowed from the Folsom Development Company to use with a ferry boat across the river. The Sacramento County Board of Supervisors also authorized the construction of a temporary bridge. Actually, Myrtle Shaw Lord, in his officially sanctioned history of the Chamber of Commerce, A Sacramento Saga: Fifty Years of Achievement‚ÄîChamber of Commerce Leadership, writes that after the flooding of 1906 and 1907 that the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce committed itself to dealing with the problems of flooding in Sacramento generally and sponsored the rebuilding of a bridge at Fair Oaks: \\"With destruction as a teacher, Sacramento learned an expensive lesson and determined there should be no repetition.\\" By the end of the year the Western Bridge and Construction Company of Omaha, Nebraska began the double truss bridge that still survives and services the community today. In fact, because of its historical and architectural significance, it was placed on the National Register of Historical Places in September 2006. The Fair Oaks Bridge‚Äôs usefulness, however, diminished with the construction of bridges at Watt Avenue (to the west) in 1959 and Hazel Avenue (to the east) in 1967, as well the widening of the Sunrise Bridge (less than half a mile west) in 1968. The Fair Oaks Bridge was closed to traffic in 1967 and became the property of the Sacramento County Parks and Recreation Department after serving more than fifty years as the major crossing over the lower American River. Parks and Recreation re-decked and painted the bridge in 1973 and opened it as a pedestrian and bicycle crossing that currently connects to the American Parkway Trail along the lower banks of the American River. Bridge structure The Fair Oaks Bridge is an excellent example of bridge construction and technology advancement in the mid- to late 19th century. It is a Pennsylvania Petit through Pratt truss bridge that extends nearly across a wide bend in the American River and is the second oldest out of ten surviving bridges of this type in the state of California (behind the historic truss bridge in Folsom that connects to Orangevale, built in 1893). The Sacramento County Surveyor hoped to minimize the number of piers in this dangerous current that necessitated very long main spans. The Pennsylvania Petit specifically addressed such applications. The two 200 ft spans were quite daring for their time. The bridge is also a rare example of the Western Bridge and Construction Company of Omaha that built truss bridges throughout the West but only rarely in California. =Truss bridge= View of Fair Oaks Bridge facing the Fair Oaks side of the river. A truss bridge is any bridge whose individual members are connected in a triangular pattern. Truss bridges date back to at least the 16th century, although the metal truss bridge, such as the Fair Oaks Bridge, dates only to the 1840s. These metal truss bridges, especially the Pratt and Warren trusses, facilitated the enormous expansion of railroad lines in the late 19th century and were instrumental in turn-of-the-century highway construction as well. The trusses form vertical sides to the bridge, connected to one another by traverse beams, and by stingers and other members which support the deck. Each truss always includes a top and bottom chord, the major beams which resist the bending induced by stresses on the bridge. The top and bottom are connected by some combination of vertical and/or diagonal members, usually both, as well as by major beams at each end, called endposts. =Pratt truss forms= The Pratt truss form, invented in 1844 by Thomas and Caleb Pratt, is the most common truss form in California and the United States. This form first appeared as a \\"combination truss\\" built in wood and iron with wooden vertical members, chords, and endposts, and iron tension diagonals. The basic form changed to all-metal construction by the 1880s. It retained the light metal diagonals but substituted heavier metal beams, posts, and chords for the wooden members. The most common Pratt type is the through truss in which the deck is carried on the lower chord, with overhead lateral supports connecting the top chords. Finally, the Pennsylvania Petit is a Pratt truss with a polygonal top chord and includes reinforcing sub-struts and sub-ties. These half-length members reinforced the diagonals and helped resist stresses. Summary The current Fair Oaks Bridge is the third manifestation of an overpass over the American River and connects Fair Oaks to the greater Sacramento region. Once a major crossing over the American River, it has been bypassed by the construction of bridges at Sunrise and Hazel in the 1950s and 1960s. The bridge, however, continues to serve as a pedestrian and bicycle crossing and remains a cultural icon for the local community. On September 25, 2006, the keeper of the National Register of Historic Places listed the Old Fair Oaks Bridge as a National Historic Site. The bridge successfully listed under the Register's criterion A (associative history) and C (architectural significance).

The community is located approximately at the intersection of Maryland State Highway 100 and the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway. It is part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Combined Statistical Area and is located just southwest of the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (commonly known as \\"BWI\\"). It is bordered by Severn to the south, Linthicum to the east, and Elkridge to the north and west. History In the past, the community also consisted of \\"Anderson\\", a post office stop founded along the B&O; tracks from 1874‚Äì1881 along modern Anderson Avenue, and operated as \\"Hanoverville\\" until December 1896. Hanover is located along the fall line where the ocean met the shore in prehistoric times. Native American tribes lived along the lower Patapsco river. archeological digs in 1929 have discovered arrowheads, spearpoints, axes, and gorgets along the Disney farm. The area is now occupied by commercial buildings along Hi Tech drive and Oxford Square development. Arundel Mills mall opened in November 2000. Since then, the area has seen explosive growth; shopping centers and housing developments have popped up along Arundel Mills Boulevard (Route 713), which links the B-W Parkway and Route 100 to Arundel Mills. In August 2010, Preston Partners sought to rezone a failed commercial project on the historic Disney farm into a transit- oriented development funded by Magic Johnson. On November 2, 2010, Anne Arundel County voters approved zoning for a gaming and entertainment complex with 4,750 slot machines at Arundel Mills Mall. This casino complex opened as Maryland Live! in June 2012.

It was formerly known as . It is known for its shoot 'em ups and its licensed fighting games.  History  Raizing and Eighting were formed in part by former staff of Compile, to create arcade games. The development was done by Raizing, while sales and distribution were done by Eighting. Their first game, Mahou Daisakusen/Sorcer Striker was released in 1993. After the arcade developer Toaplan closed their doors, some of their staff went to Raizing, while others began the offshoot companies Cave, Takumi, and Gazelle, all of which were noted for their strong support of the shoot 'em up genre, and the \\"danmaku\\" (or \\"manic\\") subgenre in particular. Raizing continued to use arcade hardware based on Toaplan's units for years after Toaplan's demise. The company featured a handful of former Compile employees, mainly those who worked on Musha Aleste, including Yuuichi Toyama (a.k.a. \\"Healthy\\"), Kazuyuki Nakashima, and Yokoo Kenichi. The company also included the famous shooting game developer Shinobu Yagawa who was the designer and programmer for Battle Garegga, Armed Police Batrider, and Battle Bakraid while at Raizing, and is now employed by Cave. In October 2000, the Raizing division was incorporated into Eighting, and since then, no shooter games were produced. The company since then concentrated its video game business to home consoles and mobile/social gaming.

It may derive from the English West Country, viz. Castle Cary on the River Cary in Somerset and/or Carey Barton on the River Carey in Devon, containing either the Pre-Celtic element 'kar'- 'stony/hard' (Watts, 2004),Victor Watts, 'Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names', Cambridge University Press, 2004 or the Celtic language element 'car' 'dear/pleasant' (Hanks, 2003).

Carey occurs as a variant of (de) Carrey in archives in Normandy, Burgundy, Franche-Comt√© etc., in France from habitational names, possibly with the Pre- Celtic element 'car'-'stony/stones'.Dr Jean-Pierre Dickes, 'Les Noms de Famille en Boulonais, Calaisis et Pays de Montreuil', Boulogne-sur-Mer, 1986, page 79 The Norman name is probably the origin of the surname in Guernsey, Channel Islands.Hanks P,. 'Dictionary of American Family Names', Oxford, 2003 Worldwide distribution The Irish provenance of Carey, through emigration, is not only particularly evident in the USA and Australia, but also in Great Britain. The first two entries under 'Carey' in the 'Dictionary of American Family Names' (Oxford, 2003) gives Irish origins; the New York Passengers List (1820‚Äì1957) show 2,058 Carey immigrants from Ireland compared with 345 from England. Current British telephone directories show highest numbers of Careys located in areas of Irish immigration: Greater London (320), Greater Manchester & Lancashire (272), Kent (163), West Yorkshire (145) and West Midlands (145). Evolution in Ireland The Southern U√≠ N√©ill sept of √ì Ciardha was dispersed by the end of the 12th century (Woulfe, MacLysaght, et al. op. cit.) due to the incursions of the Cambro-Norman invaders. Their territory at Carbury was later settled by the De Berminghams, who built the castle on top of the ancient hill settlement. This ua Ciardha sept are recorded early, e.g. 'ua Ciardai, ri Cairpri', i.e. O Carey, king of Carbury, in AD 954, Annals of Ulster, 'MaelRuaining hua Ciardha, r√≠ Cairpri', 993, Annals of Tigernach. √ì Dubhag√°in (died 1372) wrote of '√ì Ciardha over Cairbre of poets, of the tribes of Nine-hostaged Niall'. The Genealogies of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh (c 1400) mentions them: 'O Ciarda obtained heavy profit of the land of Cairbre'. They seem to re-appear in 17th-century records for County Meath, County Westmeath and County Offaly. O' Donovan writes in his notes to the above 'Topographical poems of √ì Dubhag√°in and √ì hUidhr√≠n', (1862): 'O Ciardha is now anglicised Keary and Carey, and the name is common, but to be found only among the lower orders' (note 379), and '√ì Ciardha, now anglicised Keary and Carey, a rather numerous name in the counties of Meath and Kildare' (note 447). However, this epithet type surname from 'ciar'-'dark/black' is common and widespread in Ireland and has arisen independently in other parts of the country, notably in Cos Cork, Kerry and Mayo, including diminutive forms such as √ì Ciar√°in, √ì C√©ir√≠n √ì Ciarmhach√°in and √ì Cear√°in. For example, in the Annals of Ulster in 1224 we find 'Mathgamain mac Ceithernaigh h-Ui Ceir√≠n, r√≠ Ciaraidhe Lacha na Nairne, mortuus est'. Early examples are found in those counties; and these other Carey families would not belong to the well known midland U√≠ N√©ill sept of √ì Ciardha. For example, it has been claimed that the East Cork family anciently using the form √ì Ciar√°in would account for bearers of the name Carey with origins in East Cork and the adjacent parts of Waterford (Woulfe op. cit., MacLysaght op. cit.), whereas the West Cork Careys may well have arisen separately, but having the same etymological source in the adjective/attribute 'ciar', which occurs anciently as 'cer'.√ì Corr√°in, D. 'Ireland Before the Normans', Dublin 1972. Page 203, Notes: Ch 2, (1). From the Irish records Some examples from the Fiants'Fiants of the Tudor Sovereigns, 1521‚Äì1603' official letters patent unique to Ireland (British Library, National Library of Ireland etc.) (mostly in receipt of 'pardons' for 'rebellion'): Dermot M'Donoghe O' Cary, 'gent, lord and captain' of Duhallow, North West Co Cork, 1561; Maurice Kerry, County Wexford, 1561; Patrick O' Kearine, East Cork, 1570; James Cary, County Meath, 1582; O' Kearane, County Cork, 1599; Margery Ny Kerrye, County Cork, 1600; William O'Carie of County Longford, 1602; Donnell O' Kearyne, South East Cork, 1602; O' Keryne, County Clare, several 1600s. A number of bearers occur in the '1641 Depositions', notably in Co Mayo, e.g. Cormac Cary and Co Westmeath, e.g. Laughlin √ì Cary. Also in the Calendar of State Papers e.g. John Kearie & Katherin Kery, County Limerick, 1653, are 'transported'.Calendar of State Papers relating to Ireland, National Library of Ireland In King James 11's Irish Army, 1688‚Äì90 (v.

There is also listed in French records an Ensign Kery in Creagh's Regiment.Gilbert, John T, 'A Jacobite Narrative of the War in Ireland 1688‚Äì1691', Shannon, Ireland, University Press, 1971, SBN 7165 0050 7 Regarding the above forms, Gaelic names would have been 1) simplified over time in local speech, and 2) spelt phonetically by English 17th-century officials, who would also have assimilated them to British models where available; there are common Irish names whose anglicised forms coincide with rarer British names, e.g. Brady, (Mac Br√°daigh), Boyle (√ì Baoighill), Conway (Mac Connmhaigh, Mac Conmidhe & c.), Cullen (√ì Cuilinn & c). By the mid-17th century, records taken by the Cromwellian official Sir William Petty, known as the1659 Census,S√©amus Pender Ed. 'A 'Census' of Ireland circa 1659 with essential materials from the Poll Money', Dublin, 1931 shows 'Cary' as a 'Principal Irish Name' in County Meath and County Offaly, 'McCarey/McCarrey' as a Principal Irish Name in County Westmeath and 'Kegry' also in the same county. Three 'tituladoes', or owners of land, of the name are recorded in the 1659 Census for Co Cork: one native Irish, William Cary in Kilbrittain, West Cork, head of an extensive 'family' of 23; one of possibly Norman origin, Theophilus Cary (also 'Carew' in the 'Census') sheriff of Cork, just west of Cork city in modern Ballincollig in Barretts Barony; and one English, Capt. Peter Cary, (also 'Carew' in the 'Census') a Cromwellian soldier, purchaser of a considerable estate in North East Cork. This last family, of 'Careysville' near Fermoy, claimed to be of Devonshire origin, and died out in the male line in the late 19th century.caution is advised vis-a- vis the earlier genealogies (assumed connections, inaccuracies) on the following web page: http://fosbery.tripod.com/CareyFamily.htm A number of native forms appears in the Hearth Money Rolls for Co Tipperary in 1664/5/7. These native householders would have been the progenitors of the numerous Carey families recorded in Tipperary in the 1850s (Griffith's 'Primary Valuation'). Examples in 1664 in South Tipperary: Patrick McCarda, Michael Carrig, Thomas Carry, John Cary, Wm Cary, Connor Cary, William Cary, Graine Carhe, John McCarragh, Morrish Carragh, Daniell Kyary, David Keary etc.; and in North Tipperary: Donnogh O' Chara, Derby Carragh, Rory McCarry, Matthew Carry, Unny Carrigh, Unny Carey and so forth. In the 1661 Poll Money Book for Clonmel, is Teige Cary, a 'gunstocker'. In the 1659 'Census' (O) Carrane, Carran etc. occurs throughout Tipperary in large numbers, e.g. in Iffa and Offa Barony 22 householders, in Middlethird 34. Many examples occur on the Hearth Money Rolls also. Examples: Teige O' Carrane, Clanwilliam, Edmond Carrane, Middlethird etc. This Gaelic surname, √ì Carr√°in/√ì Corr√°in, has been Anglicised as Carew as well as Carey, from the end of the 16th century.McCotter, Paul, 'The Anglo-Norman Surnames of Ireland', Part 111, Irish Roots Magazine, Issue 7, 1997 online at http://www.irishabroad.com/yourroots/genealogy/names/anglonorman/part3.asp . See also: The 'Court of Claims' in Ireland, 15 July 1663, adjudicates a request for return of lands in and around Mobernan in County Tipperary forfeited by 'Teige Carrue alias O Carron'. The Religious Census of 1766 for Co Tipperary has many entries for Car(e)y, all of whom are native 'Papists': e.g. John & Cornelius Cary, Clonoulty; Thomas Keary, Kilfeacle; Daniel Keary, Killea; Laughlin Carey and four other Careys, Cahir; John Carey/Keary, Lattin; Darby plus three other Carys, Soloheadmore etc.; Edm Keary, Templenoe etc. There are several Carews, also 'Papists', in Cloneen, Toom and Fethard. Throughout this period and the following centuries, as noted by the Registrar General, R. E. Matheson in his report of 1901, surnames in Ireland had become altered in form by regional dialects and pronunciation, the anomalies of anglicisation and the effects of illiteracy, so as to occur in a bewildering variety of forms, even within the same families.R.E. Matheson, Preface to 'Varieties and Synonyms of Surnames & Christian Names in Ireland, Dublin, 1901 Alongside this is the process of simplification already mentioned, reinforced by the mutation of the Irish form into English letters, e.g. the 'y' ending in English replacing 'aigh', 'aidh', 'dha' and even 'n' endings, '√°in, √≠n' etc. cf. 'Tipperary' and Irish original 'Tiobrad √Årann'.  Mid 19th century Irish figures By the time of the 'Primary Valuation (1847‚Äì64)' of Richard Griffith, County Tipperary had the most Carey households (239) followed by County Cork (177), County Limerick (108), County Dublin (94) and County Mayo (81), out of a total of Carey households in Ireland of 1,308. The Cary spelling occurs mostly in Westmeath (11) and Donegal (11), with a total of 33. For Keary: most in Tipperary (11), Dublin (8) and Westmeath (7) with a total of 64. All these forms are variants, with Carey becoming the most frequent mid to late 1800s. A conservative approximate total number of bearers in the 1850s may be got by multiplying the total households by an average per household of 4 (a minimal figure given the size of families then), giving 5, 364 (this figure not including other variants like Keary). Birth figures for the year 1890, from the Registrar General's 'Special Report...' (1894) were 118, of which 59 were in Munster, 36 Leinster, 13 Connacht and 10 Ulster. Principal counties were Cork, Dublin, Tipperary, Mayo & Kerry. Similarly, by multiplying the total of 118 by the average birthrate for 1890 which is 1 in 44.8, gives 5, 286. Many bearers of the name would have been part of the intense emigration from Ireland in the years following the Great Famine (Ireland) (1845‚Äì52). Evolution in England's West Country Cary is a Somerset surname possibly from one of the places therein such as Castle Cary or Lytes Cary, Pre-Celtic or Celtic language Kari/Cari, as the river. It occurs early, e.g. in the Somerset 'Feet of Fines': Philip de Kary (1203), Gunilda de Kary (1235), Peter de Cary (1280). The spelling Cary is still frequent in Somerset, as a look at telephone directories and electoral registers shows. Car(e)ys are recorded in the Mormon International Genealogical Index in Somerset: Walter Carye, Ansford, 1555, Richard Cary, Pilton, 1559, Jone Carye, Evercreech, 1576. Car(e)y is also a Devonshire name, possibly from the place in Devon on the River Carey, just east of Launceston, recorded as 'Kari' (Pre-Celtic or Celtic language) in the Domesday Book (1086).Online version of 'The Devon Carys',New York, 1920. Kari Manor is in 'Exon Domesday', fol. 3168 An early bearer of the name, Sanson de Cari, held lands in Buckland in Devon in 1197 (Devon Feet of Fines, No. 4). The Mormon I.G.I has entries for Car(e)y in Devon (records begin in 1538): e.g. Henry Cary, Knowstone, 1553, William Carey, Woodbury, 1560, Nicholas Cary, Honiton, 1571. The Devonshire Cary family of Cockington and the Manor of Clovelly recorded their eponymous ancestor in the 1564 'Visitation of Devon' as 'John Cary of Cary'. Car(e)y is also a surname in Cornwall, for which there are several possible derivations, which must also apply to the adjacent county of Devon : 1) one of several places in Cornwall with the Brythonic element 'car/caer'-'fort/enclosure', such as Kerrow, Cairo (there exist many antique site 'Caer' type names as in 'Caer Kief') ‚Äì a source also of the Carew surname; 2) a local topographical name from root Pre-Celtic 'kar' viz. 'stone/stony' as in Carey Tor in Bodmin Moor; 3) Car(e)y (river) of St. Giles-in-the-Heath, West Devon; 4) Carew of Pembrokeshire (also from root 'caer'-'fort') the Cambro-Norman surname. The Mormon I.G.I. for Cornwall records several Carey births; some early ones: John Cari, St Just, 1550, Ede Cary, St Just, 1556, Edvardus Careye, St. Ewe, 1605, Cary is also found in records in Brittany (e.g. Ille-et-Vilaine). However, an alternative origin for some families of West Country Car(e)y may be, as with the Careys of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, Norman French or Breton. As early as 1150‚Äì61 one Geoffrey de Kari is mentioned in the Norman rolls held in Calvados, as giving land to the monks near Bruton, Somerset; the other donors mentioned have Norman names: de Cantelu, de Carevilla & c. Carey as a Romani Surname As early as the 1841 Census Carey is found in significant numbers in Somerset (213 + 302 Cary), but also in South East England in Kent (210 + 11 Cary) and Sussex (194 + 13 Cary)https://search.findmypast.co.uk/search-world- records/1841-england-wales-and-scotland-census Carr(e)y also occurs as a variant in all three counties.https://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/search/master/?master_event=Census&person;_event=1841‚äÇ_event=Kent&type;=person&source;=&search;_type=person&fn;=&sn;=Carey&kw;=&yr;=‚¶•=10&search;=Search&page;=1 Sussex and Kent were the habitat of some Carey Romani families.http://romanyconnections.wikifoundry.com/page/Carey%3A A scan of the 1841 Census returns reveals bearers in these counties with first names such as Caleb, Dinah, Eliza, Hezekiah, Jemima, Keziah, Rhoda and Samson, names often found among the Romani people. Irish immigration into Britain In respect of the arrival of Irish immigrant Careys, the Mormon International Genealogical Index record of the parish registers of Lincolnshire reveals many Irish surnames from the late 16th and early 17th centuries. There are numerous entries for Car(e)y 1611, Connel 1562, Conoly 1607, Daly 1595, Kell(e)y 1566, Murphy 1627, O'Neale 1612, etc. (more examples below).Brad(e)y 1601, Carew 1603, Carrol 1691, Cawsey 1567/ Caesy 1589/ Casie 1595 ( 1st variant phonetically close to orig. Irish √ì Cathasaigh), Cashin 1627, Conerey 1576, Connel 1562, Conley 1667, Conoly 1607, Daly 1595, Farle 1656/ Ferrell 1698, Kell(e)y 1566, Kerray (cf Carey) 1586, Lerye 1566/ Leary 1634, McConway 1698, Murphy 1627, O'Neale 1612 et al. Most of the entries occur in the fenland parishes of South Lincs. Early bearers have Christian names such as Mary, Joseph, Bridget, and later Abigail, Rebeccah, Samuel... Some early Careys: Francis Carye of Stainfield, 1601, Joanis and Mariae Cary of Hatton, 1673, Bridget and Thomas Carey of Legbourne 1692. However, most of the 42 Carey and 56 Cary entries in nearby Norfolk on the 1841 Census appear to be indigenous, with forenames such as Aron, Jemima, Phoebe, Priscilla, Rhoda, Samuel and Sarah (v. also note on Romani Car(e)y families in Kent and Sussex, above).https://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/search/master/?type=person&source;=&search;_type=person&master;_event=Census&person;_event=1841‚äÇ_event=Norfolk&fn;=&sn;=Carey&kw;=&yr;=‚¶•=10&search;=Search&page;=2 This picture becomes clear when one looks at the overall distribution in Britain: one can see an established pattern of Irish immigration, particularly post 1850s; for example, 50 out of 75 Patrick Careys listed in England in the 1871 Census of England were born in Ireland. The 1871 and 1881 Censuses of England & Wales shows 790 and 800 Careys, respectively, of Irish birth as living in England and Wales. They appear mainly in London/Middlesex, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Glamorgan, Monmouth, Kent, Northumberland, Cheshire, Oxfordshire, Essex etc. The 1891 Census of England shows the highest numbers of Careys in Lancashire & Yorkshire (mainly West Yorks), with 746 and 275 respectively, followed by London (978), then Kent/Surrey/Sussex (866 together), and only then the South West with Somerset (347), Devon (98) and Cornwall (9). In a nutshell, in 1891 Lancashire, a major centre of Irish immigration in the 19th century, had more than twice the number of Careys than Somerset, the main provenance of English Car(e)y (v. supra 1841 census). The Lancashire figures are mainly in Manchester and Liverpool. The 1891 Census of Scotland lists the top two areas for Careys as Lanarkshire (mainly the Glasgow area, 153) and Angus (mainly Dundee, 78), both areas of high Irish immigration; the 1891 Census for Wales shows 221, almost all in South Wales (Glamorgan, Monmouth etc.) also areas of high Irish immigration In modern times there are large numbers of Careys in the (former) industrial areas of the Midlands and the North of England, as well, of course, as the London area. There are also numerous Careys in the Glasgow and Cardiff areas; in fact, outside London, Glasgow had the most bearers in any city telephone directory in Britain in 2001/2002. Evolution in France Carey appears in French archives: Claude Carey, b. Sa√¥ne et Loire, Bourgogne, 1590; Laurens Carey, Paris, 1595; Jehan Carey, Cher, Centre France, c. 1600; Eglantine Carey, 1600, C√¥te d'Or, Bourgogne; Mathieu Carey, Calvados, Normandie, 1625. Simon Carey, Rouen-St Denis, Normandie, 1650.http://www.genealogie.com/v4/genealogie/Search.mvc/SearchResult?name=Carey&countryId;=FR&departmentId;=FR.99.14&expended;=false&withAlert;=false&page;=1&firstPageInPagination;=1&sortField;=1&advanced;=false&categoryId1;=1&searchType;=2&acteType;= It is clear that most instances of the above are variants of (de) Carrey, for example the Carrey family of Claville, Eure, Normandy for which Carey appears as a variant during the 17th century. On the register at Houetteville in Eure is a 'Barbe Carr√©', mother in April 1671, and recorded as 'Barbe Carey' when she died in November of that year. There is a registration of a 'Carey de Cortiamble' family tree in 1729. The (de) Carreys of Bellemare, near Rouen in Seine-Maritime, Normandy are said in de Saint-Allais' Nobiliare Universel de France, Tome 1, (1814) to be originally an ancient Irish family: 'famille ancienne, d'originaire d'Irlande', (page 37). The Irish origin of the Bellemare Carreys is certainly mythical. 'Carey' in present-day France has approximately 1,674 bearers, according to one source, and is found mostly, not counting the Paris area, in Charente-Maritime, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne and Rh√¥ne, and 'Cary', with 911 bearers, is most frequent in Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Bouches-du- Rh√¥ne and Finist√®re.'Carrey', with 1,423 bearers, is found mostly in Landes, Seine-Maritime and Essonne. Guernsey, Channel Islands The Guernsey Carey name likely evolved from one of the de Carrey lines of mainland Normandy. The Manoir de Carrey near Lisieux, Calvados, Normandy, has been cited by members of the Guernsey Carey family as their own origin. (v. supra). Guernsey records note: In 1288, Johan Caree as an inhabitant of the Guernsey parish of St Martin's performing the role of ' Coustomier ' or Law Practitioner; in 1309, a landowner in St Martins by the name of Philip Caree; in 1331, noted in the Assize Roll, Johannes Karee as an official of the Ecclesiastical Court; in 1370, Jean Careye shown as a tenant within the Roll of Tenants of the Abbey and Priory of St Martins. The College of Arms issued a confirmation of Arms on 11 November 1915. Although the arms are almost identical to those of Cary of Devon, there is no known connection between the two. In the 1871 Census, ten Careys are registered as born in Guernsey and three in Jersey. There were also three Irish-born Careys in Jersey and two in Guernsey, at the same census; and the 1881 Census has eight Irish-born Careys resident in Guernsey. Migration to North America In the 21st century, by far the largest population of Careys is found in the USA, with 54, 924 individuals.U.S. Census, 2010 Many American Careys are able to trace their family origins back to Ireland via one of the waves of emigration from there, especially from the time of the Great Famine (Ireland) of 1845‚Äì1852. The large numbers of Irish Careys, well attested in the shipping registers, for the most part landing in New York and spreading through the northern states and later westwards, followed the demographics of Irish immigration. Of earlier inception, however, is Mathew Carey (1760‚Äì1839), the Irish nationalist who fled his native Dublin to settle in Philadelphia, where he founded a publishing house. More typical is former Governor of New York, Hugh Carey (1919‚Äì2011) a leading Irish-American politician descended from a 19th-century County Mayo emigrant. It is possible that the former would be of √ì Ciardha stock, whilst the latter is most probably an √ì Cear√°in through his ancestor 'Michael Kirrane'. Several Irish- American examples may be found in the biographical list below. Other Carys are of English, particularly West Country extraction, such as the Cary family of Virginia, descended from Miles Cary of Bristol (1623-1667)Fairfax Harrison, 'The Virginia Carys; an Essay in Genealogy', 1919 See also *List of people with surname Carey References Category:Surnames of Irish origin Category:Anglicised Irish-language surnames Category:Irish families Category:Celtic-language surnames Category:Cornish-language surnames Category:Carey family Category:Carey family (Guernsey) ","title":"Carey (surname)"},{"id":"2475456","text":"Tarrabool Lake is a lake located in the Northern Territory of Australia in the locality of Creswell on the western fringe of the Barkly Tableland.

In Issue 1 (May, 1881), Foote set out The Freethinker's purpose: Although closely linked with the National Secular Society for most of its history (NSS Presidents and General Secretaries have at various times also served as Freethinker editor), The Freethinker is strictly autonomous and is not, and never has been, published by the NSS. In 2006, the magazine's front- page masthead was changed from \\"Secular humanist monthly\\" to \\"The Voice of Atheism since 1881\\". Barry Duke is the current editor. History Following the publication of anti-religious cartoons in the Christmas 1882 edition of The Freethinker, Foote was prosecuted for blasphemy, and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with hard labour. On receiving his sentence from Mr Justice North (a devout Catholic), Foote said \\"with great deliberation\\" to the Judge \\"My Lord, I thank you; it is worthy of your creed\\".

The Isnag people (also referred to as the Isneg and Apayao) are an Austronesian ethnic group native to Apayao Province in the Philippines' Cordillera Administrative Region. Their native language is Isneg (also called Isnag), although most Isnag also speak Ilokano. Two major sub-groups among the Isnag are known: the Ymandaya, mostly concentrated in the municipality of Calanasan; and the Imallod, with populations distributed among the other towns of the province. Isnag populations can also be found in the eastern part of the adjacent Provinces of Ilocos Norte and Cagayan.  Etymology  Various names have been used to differentiate the Isnag. The Spaniards referred to them as los Apayaos (referring to the river along which they live) and los Mandayas (taken from the Isnag term meaning ‚Äúupstream‚Äù).  Demographics  Today, there are about 40,000 Isnegs living in Apayao. Isnag Isnag populations can also be found in the Eastern part of the Province of Ilocos Norte, specifically the municipalities of Adams, Carasi, Dumalneg and Solsona; and in the Northwestern part of the Province of Cagayan, specifically the municipalities of Sta. Praxedes, Claveria and Sanchez Mira. = Language = Isneg language is spoken by around 300,000 people mostly by the Isnag people, who are also bilingual in Ilokano. = Religion = Approximately 9% of the population are Christians. As of 2006, the entire New Testament, along with the books of Genesis and Exodus, had been translated into Isnag by SIL. Rest of the Isnags are mainly animists. = Cuisine = They were proud of using bamboo as cooking utensils. They have sinursur, a dish made of catfish or eel on bamboo with chili, abraw, freshwater crabs with coconut and chili, sinapan, which looks like smoked meat. They used anything they can find in nature as food, from brooks, rivers, lakes and streams, they catch fish and other creatures in it. In forests, they use any edible leaves in there. They douse the harvest in cooking it with chili.  Culture  Isneg, or Isnag, kinship is bilateral, meaning children are equally related to both the mother and the father. Households consist of interrelated families living close to each other, and extended families of three generations living together in their balay. The family is the key element in society, the larger the better, headed by the husband. No other society structure exists, though brave men, mengals, lead in hunting and fishing. The bravest, Kamenglan, is the overall leader. A young man entered their ranks after the first headhunting expedition. A mengal carries a red kerchief on the head and has tattoos on his arms and shoulders. They are animistic and practice polygamy. Early accounts of the Isnag :The Isnag are distinguished from the other Cordillerans by the fine construction of their houses, resembling that of the lowland Filipinos, and they are particularly conspicuous about cleanliness. Their houses are set on four large and strong straight posts of incorruptible wood resistant to humidity, driven into the earth; instead of being made of bamboo cut in long narrow strips joined by rattan, as the lowland Filipinos do. Their houses are airy and bigger, and they do everything to decorate it the best way they can. They barter for products from their mountains, such as beeswax, cacao, and tobacco. :Jean Mallat, a French adventurer in the Philippines during the 1800s.

Competitions have been held in the United States and several European countries.  History  Rabbit jumping started in Sweden early in the 1970s, when the first rabbit club started to arrange rabbit jumping competitions. At that time, the rules were based on the rules from horse jumping, but were later reformed to be better suited for rabbits.http://skhrf.se/english/ In 1987, the first national championship for \\"straight course easy level\\" was held in Stockholm, Sweden. The sport grew throughout Sweden and several rabbit jumping clubs were formed to support the growing interest. In the early 1990s, Norway joined in with rabbit jumping activities, developing new clubs and joining Sweden in rabbit jumping competitions. The Swedish Federation of Rabbit Jumping (SKHRF) was established on September 3, 1994. Rabbit show jumping became popular in all parts of Sweden. Germany joined the other countries in starting their own rabbit hopping club in 2000. Organizations were established in Norway (2002) and Finland (2004). Training and participation with translations for a new set of rabbit hopping rules came from the judges' committee in Denmark. 2001 brought forth the Rabbit Hopping Organization of America. The rules and guidelines for rabbit hopping were established for all Americans with the help of the judges' committee in Denmark and with personal assistance from hopping judge Aase Bjerner. The American Hopping Association for Rabbits and Cavies (AHARC) was chartered with the American Rabbit Breeders Association in 2013. The rules and guidelines for this association were molded after RHOA. and Denmark. The AHARC held the very first official national competition in the United States during the 2011 ARBA Convention in Indianapolis, IN. The performance competition for rabbits during 2013 ARBA convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was a Mid Atlantic Rabbit and Cavy event. AHARC will have the first national performance event for cavies during the 2014 ARBA TX convention. 2013 saw the beginnings of The Rabbit Hopping Society Of Australia also with the assistance of Aase and Rasmus Bjerner. In 2015 Freya Pocock Johansson founded Rabbit Hopping New Zealand.http://rabbithoppingnz.wix.com/rabbithoppingnz  Record jumps  The world record for the highest rabbit jump is , and was achieved in June 2019 by Miss Pinkys Grand Champion Harajuku \\"Dobby\\", owned by Julia Samson from Sweden.

In a straight course all the obstacles are placed in a straight line and have to be jumped in succession. In a crooked course, the obstacles are placed in an interloping path in which the obstacles must be jumped in the correct order. Straight and crooked courses are divided into 5 levels.http://skhrf.se/english/ Mini: Max 26 cm high, 30cm long (6-8 obstacles) Easy: Max 30 cm high, 45cm long (8 obstacles) Medium: Max 38 cm high, 65cm long (10 obstacles) Advanced: Max 45 cm high, 75cm long (10 obstacles) Elite: Max 50 cm high, 80cm long (12 obstacles) The mini-course is just an introductory course. In order to progress from easy to medium, etc. a rabbit has to earn promotion points. Rabbits are placed according to the number of faults they have (such as knocking a rail down) time only comes into play if 2 placing rabbits have tied for the same placing. A rabbit has a set time (usually 2 minutes) to complete the course, if the time runs out before the course is completed, the rabbit is disqualified.  Breeds  Rabbit jumping over a fence at Rabbit Show Jumping All breeds are allowed to compete; however, there may be problems with smaller and larger breeds. ( dwarf rabbits are smaller than and giants bigger than .) The ideal jumping rabbit has long legs and a medium-long back, which will help it correctly judge the height and length of obstacles. In the case of slender bone structures, such as the Belgian Hare, the legs should be strong and muscular so high jumps will not hurt them. In Scandinavia, where rabbit show jumping has a strong base, most are crossbreeds, bred with good jumpers as parents, similar to the method of breeding lurchers, deliberately crossbred racing dogs. It wouldn't be incorrect to say that Scandinavian Jumping Rabbits are their own breed, with well-kept pedigrees.

The village is situated west of Goss Moor and north of Fraddon approximately ten miles (16 km) west-southwest of Bodmin.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin It is in the civil parish of St Enoder It is home to a primary school and a recreational park for children. The A30 trunk road ran through the village until the construction of a bypass in the 1990s. Black Cross is a nearby hamlet. The village is the site of a Victorian era preaching pit constructed out of a disused quarry: the pit comprises large stepped rings and a preaching area the size and shape of half a bandstand. Who was the Indian Queen? Pocahontas Crescent; street sign at Indian Queens, close to the site of the inn A number of stories try to explain who the Indian Queen was. Each version agrees that the name comes from the name of a coach/post house or inn. The name cannot be traced earlier than the 19th century. The inn was built on a plot of land known as White Splat in the late 18th century. The Indian Queen Inn stood beside the road leading from Goss Moor to Fraddon, just below the top of the hill. The pub had a small porch and displayed as a sign the portrait of an Indian queen. An inscription on the porch told the story of a Portuguese princess who landed at Falmouth in packet days, and slept one night at this inn on her way to London. Her swarthy appearance gave onlookers the impression that she was an Indian. It has also been suggested that the royal lady was Pocahontas (1595‚Äì1617), an American Indian who was the younger daughter of Powhatan, chief of the Indian tribes who lived along the Virginia coast. There is very little evidence to support this story; nevertheless, it is still commonly given as the origin of the name. Pocahontas's name has been given to a modern street in Indian Queens known as Pocahontas Crescent. Up to April 1780, the inn had the name \\"The Queen's Head\\". Sometime thereafter, and definitely by 1787, it had become \\"The Indian Queen\\". It seems that the name became \\"The Indian Queens\\" around the end of the 18th century. The signboard displayed an American Indian on one side and Victoria as Queen of India on the other. (Queen Victoria reigned 1837‚Äì1901; from 1877 she was Empress of India.) On the Ordnance Survey map of Cornwall, 1868-1896, the village is marked as \\"Indian Queen\\" and the inn is the \\"Indian Queen Hotel\\". The pub was demolished in the 1960s and its old signboard resides in the Truro Museum. In 2009 the old stone lintel from the pub reappeared on a house in Indian Queens not far from the site of the original pub. It bears the inscription \\"THE INDIAN QUEEN LICENSED BREWER AND RETAILER OF BEER, CYDER, WINE, AND TOBACCO. LICENSED to the POST HORSES\\" Musical associations On his 2001 CD The Convincer, Nick Lowe wrote and sang a song called \\"Indian Queens\\", about a drifter who yearns to return there after a lifetime of travelling.

Howe Institute () is a Canadian nonprofit policy research organization in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Institute is supported by membership fees paid by corporations as well as individuals in the business, professional and academic fields. As a registered charity, membership fees are eligible for tax refunds from the government of Canada. It is located in the Trader's Bank Building in downtown Toronto. The institute publishes research that is national in scope and hosts events across Canada on a wide variety of issues in economic and social policy. As a non-profit, politically independent organization, its official mandate is to improve the standard of living for Canadians through public policy solutions. Institute The C. D. Howe Institute's origins go back to Montreal in 1958 when a group of prominent business and labour leaders organized the Private Planning Association of Canada (PPAC) to research and promote educational activities on issues related to public economic policy. In 1973, the PPAC's assets and activities became part of the C. D. Howe Memorial Foundation, created in 1961 to memorialize the late Right Honourable Clarence Decatur Howe. The new organization operated as the C. D. Howe Research Institute until 1982, when the Memorial Foundation chose to focus directly on memorializing C. D. Howe; the institute then adopted its current name: the C. D. Howe Institute. The institute's research has been cited by Liberal, New Democrat and Conservative members of parliament. The media has described the institute as a centrist, Right-wing , conservative, non-partisan, think tank. It has a history of publishing research on both sides of the ideological spectrum, provided it is supported with empirical evidence. It has been described as having a \\"deep intellectual grounding to its public-policy approach\\". The institute derives the majority of its funding from membership fees paid by corporations as well as individuals in the business, professional and academic fields. The institute has had considerable impact on Canadian public policy. Institute policy work has laid the intellectual groundwork in such areas as these: * The development of free trade; * The development of rigorous inflation targets and related monetary policy; * The reform of the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans; * Lower corporate tax rates; * The development of the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).

Until 1996, when Genesee & Wyoming Inc. bought it, the company was named the Chicago and Illinois Midland Railway . It was once a Class I railroad, specializing in the hauling of coal. At the end of 1970 it operated 121 route-miles on 214 miles of track; it reported 255 million ton-miles of revenue freight that year. History The history of the Chicago and Illinois Midland Railway traces to 1888 when the villagers of Pawnee built a rail line from their town to the Illinois Central Railroad mainline 15 miles south of Springfield. The railroad was named the Pawnee Railroad and was later extended eastward to Taylorville and a rail connection with what is today the Norfolk Southern Railway (ex-Wabash Railroad). In 1905 the Chicago Edison Company (the predecessor of Commonwealth Edison Company, the Chicago electric utility, now part of Exelon Corp) purchased the Pawnee Railroad for the purpose of transporting coal out of the central Illinois coal fields for Chicago Edison's coal-fired power plants in Chicago. Samuel Insull, the founder of Commonwealth Edison helped develop the coal fields along with Francis Peabody and his Illinois Midland Coal Company. Thus the railroad's name was changed from the Pawnee Railroad to the Chicago and Illinois Midland Railway Company, drawing its name not from its terminal points (the C&IM; never went to Chicago), but from its corporate parents: Chicago Edison and Illinois Midland Coal Company. In the 1920s Insull bought some of the trackage of the bankrupt Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad (CP&StL;), running from Springfield to Havana on the Illinois River and then running northeast from Havana to East Peoria. He connected his new acquisition with the existing C&IM; by obtaining 15 miles of trackage rights over the Illinois Central from Springfield to the connection between the C&IM; and the IC at a point known as CIMIC. Insull then built a rail-to-river coal transfer facility on the Illinois River at Havana, IL, where coal could be dumped from rail cars into barges for shipment up the Illinois River to Commonwealth Edison power plants on the river in the Chicago area. Insull, being a believer in \\"vertical integration\\", thus was able to control the mining and shipment of coal, via his railroad, to his coal transfer plant, to his barges, to his power plants, where it was burned to create electricity for transmission on his lines to the customers in Chicago. Chicago & Illinois Midland 2-8-2, Number 551, the sole surviving C&IM; Steam locomotive, on display at the Museum of Transportation outside St. Louis, Missouri When the Clean Air Act was passed in the 1960s the market for high sulfur central Illinois coal evaporated and the coal mines (at one time numbering 15) along the C&IM; closed one by one. Commonwealth Edison put the C&IM; on the market and offered to sell it for $1.00, but there were no takers. Then Commonwealth Edison changed its philosophy and began building power plants in central Illinois, adjacent to C&IM; tracks, sending electricity to Chicago via high voltage lines. Soon the C&IM; was back in action, but this time it was hauling coal into central Illinois from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana, instead of hauling coal out of the central Illinois coal fields. Soon unit coal trains, received in interchange from Burlington Northern and the Chicago and North Western were traversing C&IM; tracks to Commonwealth Edison's power plant at Powerton (Pekin) and to the still operating Havana Coal Transfer Plant. However, by the late 1980s Commonwealth Edison's philosophy changed again. In the wake of railroad deregulation in 1980, they began seeking competitive bids from railroads who could deliver western coal directly to Chicago. As a result, Commonwealth Edison sold the C&IM; in December 1987 to a group of private investors. The ownership of the C&IM; changed hands twice more before it was purchased by Genesee & Wyoming Inc. in 1996 and the name was changed to Illinois and Midland Railroad.

Biography  Mithridates IV was of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. He was born to Mithridates III of Pontus and Laodice.Callatay, The First Royal Coinage of Pontos (from Mithridates III to Mithridates V) p.21 Mithridates IV had two siblings: a brother, Pharnaces I of Pontus, and a sister, Laodice.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p. 90 Mithridates IV is first mentioned in 179 BC, as he is associated with Pharnaces I in a treaty concluded by Pharnaces I with the King of Pergamon, Eumenes II, in a manner which suggests that he shared some sovereign power.Polybius, Histories xxxiii. 12. The date of Mithridates‚Äô accession to the Pontian throne is unknown, but he is recorded as the ruler of Pontus in 154 BC, when he is mentioned as sending an auxiliary force to assist the King of Pergamon, Attalus II Philadelphus, against the King of Bithynia, Prusias II. This was an important event as it signalled the start of a policy of friendship between the Kingdom of Pontus and the Roman Republic and her allies which would continue until Mithridates VI Eupator.Polybius, Histories xxv. 2. At an unknown date, Mithridates IV married his sister, Laodice.Getzel, Hellenistic settlements in Europe, the islands and Asia Minor p. 387 They appeared to have no children. His royal title and full name was Mithridates Philopator Philadelphus.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.35  Coinage  Coinage has survived issued by Mithridates IV alone as well as coins issued with Laodice. The coins issued with his sister-wife display a fine double portrait and they adapted a Ptolemaic model for coinage.Callatay, The First Royal Coinage of Pontos (from Mithridates III to Mithridates V) p.21 The coinage draws attention to his Persian and Greek origins. An example of a coin on which Mithridates IV honours his Persian origins was one featuring a reverse type of Perseus. This coin could have been issued before he married. Perseus can be seen as a bridge between ancient Greek and Persian cultures. Although Perseus was a Greek hero, he had Persian associations; the Persians regarded him as an Assyrian.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.35 Perseus is standing, and wearing a chlamys, pointed curved helmet and winged boots. In his left hand, he holds the harp and his right hand holding the head of Medusa.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.35 The star and crescent are also present with his full name.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.35 The obverse had a portrait of him alone.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.35 Another coin from his joint rule with his sister-wife highlights his Greek origins. On one side is a draped bust of Mithridates IV and Laodice; on the reverse side, their royal titles in Greek: ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïŒ©Œ£ ŒúŒôŒòŒ°ŒëŒîŒëŒ§ŒüŒ• ŒöŒëŒô ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒôŒ£Œ£ŒóŒ£ ŒõŒëŒüŒîŒôŒöŒóŒ£ Œ¶ŒôŒõŒëŒîŒïŒõŒ¶Œ©Œù which means of King Mithridates and Queen Laodice Philadelphoi.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.35 Philadelphoi is the plural for the Greek word Philadelphus which means sibling-loving. On the side of their royal titles, the coin depicts Mithridates IV and Laodice struck in the image of the Greek patron gods Zeus and Hera, who are standing facing front. Hera is holding a sceptre in her right hand, while Zeus laureate holds a sceptre in his right hand and a thunderbolt in his left.Callatay, The First Royal Coinage of Pontos (from Mithridates III to Mithridates V) p.15 The choice of coinage is a declaration of Hellenism.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.35 ReferencesSources *B.C.

Toussid√© lies in the Tibesti Mountains, the large Yirrigu√© caldera and the smaller Trou au Natron and Doon Kidimi craters are close to it. It has an elevation of above sea level. The volcano is the source of a number of lava flows, which have flowed westward away from Toussid√© and east into the Yirrigu√© caldera. Trou au Natron, the depression southeast of the volcano, measures approximately in diameter and in depth. During the last glacial maximum or the early-middle Holocene, it was filled with a lake. A number of volcanic cones have developed within Trou au Natron. Fumarolic activity on the peak of Toussid√© and geothermal manifestations within Trou au Natron represent signs of volcanic activity at Toussid√©.  Names  Toussid√© is also known as Tarso Toussid√©. \\"Trou au Natron\\" refers to the springs which have deposited white trona in the caldera. \\"Toussid√©\\" translates as \\"Which killed the local people (Tou) with fire\\".  Geography and geomorphology  Regional = Toussid√© is part of the western Tibesti mountains in Chad, Africa. The Tibesti mountains reach elevations of and are surrounded by the Sahara. The towns of Bardai and Zouar lie east-northeast and south of Toussid√©, respectively, and a road between the two passes just southeast from Trou au Natron. Another volcano in Tibesti is Emi Koussi, which is the highest mountain of the Tibesti and of the entire Sahara region. The volcano Tarso Toh lies northwest of Toussid√©, the Botoum and Botoudoma/Petit Botoum rhyolite extrusions are located south of Trou au Natron. The origin of volcanism in Tibesti is unclear; both a hotspot-related mechanism and tectonic effects of the collision between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate have been proposed. = Local = Toussid√© is a symmetrical high stratovolcano, the second highest peak in Tibesti and the highest peak in the western Tibesti mountains. In the past it was considered to be lower, only , before a higher summit height was determined by Jean Tilho and W.G. Tweedale (1920). It rises above the surrounding landscape and covers a base of , dominating the surroundings. The summit cone is formed by lapilli, pyroclastics and scoria, one half has a white colour and the other half is black; some areas are white from fumarolic alteration. Lava flows emanate from Toussid√© in a radial pattern and reach lengths of , covering an area of . These flows descended valleys towards the west and may have buried an older volcanic edifice of Toussid√©. The flows have a ropy appearance with a diverse surface texture, including bubbly, glassy and porphyric textures, which are very fresh and free of erosion. The surface of the flows is rough and can be a problem to climbers. The relatively steep slopes of Toussid√© may reflect the existence of a lava dome underneath the younger lavas; some flows may have originated from parasitic vents. Toussid√© itself lies in part within an even larger caldera, the \\"pre-Toussid√©\\" (also known as \\"Yirrigu√©\\") caldera which is in part filled by the lava flows from Toussid√© and eruption products from the more recent explosion craters, as well as debris that fell from the steep caldera margin. Toussid√© is located on the caldera's western side, and the smaller Trou au Natron caldera cuts into the flanks of Yirrigu√©. Yirrigu√© contains a small cinder cone and an associated long lava flow, as well as an alluvial plain. The \\"Yirrigu√©\\" caldera is part of a large rhyolitic shield-shaped volcano that developed on top of a tectonic horst, which in turn may have been formed by intrusion of magmas. The ignimbrites have buried older terrain and filled valleys. Southeast of Toussid√© lies the wide caldera Trou au Natron (also known as Doon or Doon Orei). Its high rim is cut into sequences of lavas and older volcanic cones. In places it is almost vertical. Inside of Trou au Natron are four recent basaltic volcanic cones, the most remarkable of which is the high Moussosomi, which has erupted a lava flow. Three of these cones are deeply eroded. Cones are also located outside of the Trou au Natron, and their eruption products have in part flowed into the crater. Like Toussid√©, the position of Trou au Natron appears to be controlled by the ring fault of the \\"pre-Toussid√©\\" caldera. A salty swamp lies within Trou au Natron, whose floor is in part covered by evaporites, mainly sodium sulfate. Another wide and deep crater, Doon Kidimi (also known as Petit Trou or Doon Kinimi), lies northeast of Trou au Natron; it is among the most pristine volcanic features in the region. Additional volcanoes in the neighbourhood are the high Ehi Timi northeast and the high Ehi Sosso/Ehi Soso east of Toussid√©, the former of which features lava domes. The river Enneri Oudingueur originates closely in the area and becomes a tributary of the Enneri Bardagu√©, which drains the Tibesti northward.

Fed by meltwater from snow, this lake persisted for several thousands of years. Aside from a lake level drop between 14,90014,600 years before present, the lake existed until about 12,400 years before present. Later analysis suggested that there was no late Pleistocene lake stage and that Trou au Natron was filled with water between 8,645 calibrated radiocarbon years ago to about 4,425 calibrated radiocarbon years ago, thus at the same time as lakes in the lowland. Charophyte algae (such as Chara globularis and Chara vulgaris), diatoms, gastropods, golden algae, sponges and stromatoliths lived in the lake. Ferns and mosses colonized the margins of the crater. The lake reached maximum depths of at a minimum , at least once reaching . Such a large size, relative to its catchment, has raised the question of where this water came from. The formation of such a lake during the glacial maximum was probably dependent on orographic precipitation transported by the subtropical jet stream.  Geology  The Tibesti mountains are part of a volcanic province that reaches from Libya into Chad and covers a total surface area of about . The Tibesti Mountains have been volcanically active since the late Cenozoic, with one old volcanic unit being dated to 17 million years ago. While all the higher peaks are volcanoes, not all of Tibesti is formed by volcanic material; the volcanoes have developed on top of a basement uplift. The terrain beneath Toussid√© is formed by Precambrian schists and sandstones, including the Nubian Sandstone. A thick layer of ash has covered much of the terrain and with the exception of the younger volcanoes only few parts of the terrain crop out. Several of these outcrops can be found east of Trou au Natron. The volcanism of the Tibesti has been subdivided into several series. The volcano has erupted rhyolite, trachybasalt bordering on trachyandesite, which define a subalkaline/hyperalkaline suite. The lavas contain phenocrysts of augite, olivine, plagioclase and sanidine. The cones in Trou au Natron are andesitic. Yirrigu√© conversely has erupted peralkaline rhyolite, while Ehi Timi erupted rhyolite and trachyte and Ehi Sosso only rhyolite. The formation of Trou au Natron has been accompanied by the eruption of bedrock material.  Climate and vegetation  Annual temperatures at Trou au Natron fluctuate between , with a daily temperature variation of ; this is less than in the lowlands. At higher altitudes frost can be expected. Precipitation amounts to at Trou au Natron. Most of it falls as frontal precipitation during summer, and it is more copious than in the lowlands; the Tibesti mountains are the sources for wadis. Other, more indirect estimates yield precipitation of per year at Toussid√©. A characteristic vegetation has been discovered on the fumaroles of Toussid√©. It ranges from cyanophyceae, ferns, mosses, Oldenlandia and Selaginella within the fumarole vents to small meadows consisting of mosses and Campanula monodiana, Fimbristylis minutissima, Lavandula antineae, Mollugo nudicaulis, Oxalis corniculata, Satureja biflora and other species. The growth of these plants is favoured by the water emanating from the fumaroles. The plant Erodium toussidanum is endemic at the fumaroles of Toussid√©, and the mountain is the type locality of Salvia tibestiensis. Trou au Natron also has its own unique flora, including many Sahelian species.  Eruption history  Volcanic activity at Toussid√© appears to be of Quaternary age. The \\"pre-Toussid√©\\" caldera is considered to be the source of numerous local ignimbrites, including the 430,000 ¬± 110,000 year old Yirrigu√© ignimbrite. This ignimbrite covers a surface area of with about of rock. The eruption that generated this ignimbrite also led to the formation of the Yirrigu√© caldera. Trou au Natron probably formed through two or three separate phreatic eruptions that deposited large blocks around the crater, while an alternative proposal that considers it a collapse caldera appears to not be consistent with field evidence. It formed after the \\"pre-Toussid√©\\" caldera considering that its caldera rim is cut by Trou au Natron, at a time where part of the Toussid√© volcano already existed, but before the W√ºrm glaciation. Doon Kidimi on the other hand may have formed during the Neolithic Subpluvial, and after Trou au Natron. Toussid√© is among the youngest volcanoes in Tibesti, and may have erupted in historical time. A large number of fumaroles are active on its summit, exhaling mainly water vapour at temperatures of ; thus it is considered to be the only active Tibesti volcano. Likewise, the volcanic cones in Trou au Natron are considered to be recent, lake deposits underneath the cones have been radiocarbon-dated to be between 15,000 and 12,500 years old. Finally, in Trou au Natron there are hot springs that deposit trona and fumarolic activity has been reported there.

Squinting is most often practiced by people who suffer from refractive errors of the eye who either do not have or are not using their glasses. Squinting helps momentarily improve their eyesight by slightly changing the shape of the eye to make it rounder, which helps light properly reach the fovea. Squinting also decreases the amount of light entering the eye, making it easier to focus on what the observer is looking at by removing rays of light which enter the eye at an angle and would need to otherwise be focused by the observer's faulty lens and cornea. Pinhole glasses, which severely restrict the amount of light entering the cornea, have the same effect as squinting. It is a common belief that squinting worsens eyesight. However, according to Robert MacLaren, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford, this is nothing more than an old wives' tale: the only damage that can be caused by squinting for long periods is a temporary headache due to prolonged contraction of the facial muscles. Squinting is also a common involuntary reflex, especially among people with light colored eyes, during adaptation to a sudden change in lighting such as when one goes from a dark room to outdoors on a sunny day to avoid pain or discomfort of the eyes. The pupillary light reflex caused by adjustment to light takes around five minutes in people with healthy eyes, so squinting and pain after that could be a sign of photophobia.

Best known for her work as a legal adviser and a participant in peace negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian organizations, she has since been associated with Stanford University, Harvard University, and the Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU).  Early life and education  Buttu was born in Canada to Palestinian Arab parents. According to a brief biography of Buttu at the Institute for Middle East Understanding, her parents \\"did not discuss their Palestinian identity.\\" Buttu said that they tried \\"to insulate me,\\" having left Israel \\"because of the sheer discrimination.\\" She received a B.A. in Middle East and Islamic Studies and an LL.M. from the University of Toronto, a J.D. from Queen's University Faculty of Law, a J.S.M. from Stanford Law School, and an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.  Negotiator and analyst  Buttu began her work as negotiator in 2000, shortly after the outbreak of the Second Intifada, by serving as a spokesperson for the Negotiations Support Unit of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Economist described her in 2005 as being part of the closest thing to a Palestinian makeover. Al-Ahram Weekly ran an op-ed piece in 2005 in which she was lauded for projecting an image that was the opposite of the stereotype of Palestinians as villains. Buttu has since gone on to work as a political analyst at the Institute for Middle East Understanding, \\"an independent non- profit organization that provides journalists with quick access to information about Palestine and the Palestinians, as well as expert sources, both in the United States and in the Middle East.\\"  Academic activities  Buttu has held a fellowship at the Stanford Center for Conflict Resolution and Negotiation and is currently listed as an instructor at Harvard Extension School. She taught a Harvard course entitled \\"Negotiations Skills: Strategies for Increased Effectiveness\\" as part of the September 2013 program and the 2014 March, July, and October programs.  Views  In an NPR interview given early in her tenure as a PLO adviser, Buttu suggested it was the responsibility of the U.S. to solve the problem between Israel and Palestine. \\"I had mixed feelings about negotiating,\\" Buttu has said. \\"There is a structural problem when Palestinians negotiate with Israelis. It's like negotiating with a gun to your head; where the people under occupation have to negotiate their own release.\\" In a 2008 CNN interview, Buttu insisted that Palestinian rockets do not have explosive warheads, and suggested that Hamas is a result of the Israeli occupation. Buttu proposed in a 2010 article that the U.S. make its aid to Israel contingent on its withdrawal from West Bank settlements. In 2011, after the Palestine Papers were made public, Buttu called for the resignation of Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator, saying that the documents revealed how \\"out of touch and unrepresentative\\" the Palestinian negotiators were. In a 2011 interview, Buttu said that she was aware that the Palestinians had been willing to give up West Bank territory to the Israelis as part of a peace agreement. Buttu maintained in a 2012 op-ed that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are \\"futile\\" given the power imbalance between the two parties. \\"Every Israeli proposal, and later the underlying premise of the negotiations,\\" she additionally argued, \\"sought to accommodate Israel‚Äôs illegal behavior.\\" In a CNN interview in November 2012, Buttu said that conflict between the Palestinians and Israel would not end until Israel was held \\"to account under international law.\\" This, she explained, meant forcing Israel to \\"completely withdraw from the West Bank and from the Gaza Strip,\\" thus allowing \\"all Palestinians to live in freedom.\\" In a November 2012 op-ed for the Globe and Mail, Buttu called Gaza \\"an open-air prison\\" and charged that \\"Israel's latest bombing campaign...does not distinguish civilian from combatant, adult from child.\\" She accused Israel of setting \\"policies on the minimum number of calories needed to prevent malnutrition\\" and of strictly limiting Gaza's access to the sea. Buttu reiterated in a January 2013 interview that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, both before, during, and after her involvement, had failed \\"primarily because we had two very unequal parties.\\" In the same interview she expressed the desire that Mahmoud Abbas would \\"sign on to the International Criminal Court,\\" \\"hold Israel accountable for the settlement construction and expansion,\\" and \\"declare this apartheid.\\" In a July 2014 interview with CNN, Buttu downplayed Hamas's alleged use of human shields, said it was not true, would be a war crime if it was, and suggested it was racist to assume many Palestinians would act as human shields. CNN host Jake Tapper said video of two senior Hamas officials calling for civilians to act as human shields to protect buildings targeted by Israeli airstrikes proved that it was a common tactic by the militant group. In a July 2014 debate, Buttu responded to Hillel Neuer's request that Buttu should renounce Hamas because it is \\"anti-woman, anti-gay, anti-human rights\\" with \\"if you want me to renounce [Hamas] because they are anti-woman, anti- everything then I will also renounce Israel which is also anti-woman, anti- free speech, anti-gay, anti-everything.\\" To which Hillel replied \\"Diana, what you are saying is preposterous. In Tel Aviv there's a gay parade every year.\\" Buttu explained her comment was in reference to \\"Israel deflecting blame from its war crimes\\" by blaming Hamas. In 2018, in an opinion piece in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Butto stated that she regretted being part of the Palestinian negotiating team. \\"It is repugnant that the world demands that Palestinians negotiate their freedom, while Israel continues to steal Palestinian land.\\"I Advised the Palestinian Negotiating Team.

The 'battle', also known as \\"Bloody Friday\\" or \\"Black Friday\\", took place on Friday 31 January 1919 82 days after the end of the First World War. During the riot, the Sheriff of Lanarkshire called for military aid, and British troops, supported by six tanks, were moved to key points in Glasgow. The strike leaders were arrested for inciting the riot. Although it is often stated that there were no fatalities, one police constable died several months later from injuries received during the rioting. The \\"Forty Hours Strike\\"  The end of the First World War saw the United Kingdom demobilise its military and industry from its war footing, reducing employment. This combined with the increasingly worsening domestic fiscal and monetary environment to create the prospect of mass unemployment. The Scottish TUC and Clyde Workers' Committee (CWC) sought to increase the availability of jobs open to demobilised soldiers by reducing the working week from a newly-agreed 47 hours to 40 hours. The resulting strike began on Monday 27 January, with a meeting of around 3,000 workers held at the St. Andrew's Halls. By 30 January, 40,000 workers from the Clydes engineering and shipbuilding industries had joined. Sympathy strikes also started among local power station workers and miners from the nearby Lanarkshire and Stirlingshire pits. The rapid growth of the action was credited to flying pickets, most of whom were recently discharged servicemen. This was Scotland's most widespread strike since the Radical War of 1820, which had followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars. On 29 January a delegation of strikers met the Lord Provost of Glasgow, and it was agreed that he would send a telegram to the Deputy Prime Minister, Andrew Bonar Law, asking the government to intervene. It was agreed that the strikers would return at noon on Friday 31 January to hear the response. After the meeting, the Sheriff of Lanarkshire contacted the government to ask if military aid would be available to him, if needed, should there be any disorder on the Friday. The telegram and the Sheriff's request prompted the War Cabinet to discuss the 'Strike Situation in Glasgow' War Cabinet on 30 January\\"War Cabinet, Minutes of Meeting 522, 30 January 1919\\". UK National Archives. CAB 23/9/9 The meeting was chaired by Bonar Law in the absence of the Prime Minister, Lloyd George. Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War and Robert Munro, Secretary of State for Scotland, who were not members of the War Cabinet were in attendance, among others. At the meeting concern was voiced that, given the concurrent European popular uprisings, the strike had the possibility to spread throughout the country. While it was government policy at the time to not involve itself in labour disputes, the agreed action was justified to ensure there was 'sufficient force'The Glasgow Herald, 7 February 1919 present within the immediate locale of Glasgow to secure the continuation of public order and operation of municipal services.Pamphlet, Duties in Aid of the Civil Power, \\"Use of military personnel in aid of civil powers in event of civil disturbances and strikes\\".

Violence between protesters and police On 31 January, a large number of strikers (contemporary estimates range from 20,000 to 25,000) congregated in George Square. They were awaiting an answer to the telegram the Lord Provost of Glasgow had sent to the Prime Minister on behalf of a delegation of strikers on 29 January, asking the government to intervene. Accounts differ on what initiated the violence on the day, but police testimony at the following trials records that the police baton charged the striking workers at 12:20.Evening News, 31 January 1919 As the fighting started in George Square, a Clyde Workers' Committee deputation was in the Glasgow City Chambers meeting with the Lord Provost of Glasgow. On hearing the news, CWC leaders David Kirkwood and Emanuel Shinwell left the City Chambers. Kirkwood was knocked to the ground by a police baton. Then he, William Gallacher and Shinwell were arrested. They were charged with \\"instigating and inciting large crowds of persons to form part of a riotous mob\\". Kirkwood was found not guilty at trial after a photograph was submitted to the court, showing him being struck from behind by a policeman, in an apparently unprovoked attack. After the baton charge, the outnumbered police retreated from George Square. The fighting between the strikers and police, some mounted, spread into the surrounding streets and continued into the night.National Records of Scotland file JC 36/31, Trial transcript from the trial of William McCartney etc. Evidence of the Chief Constable During the evening Police Constable William McGregor (who had recently returned to the police from the army) was struck on the head by a bottle thrown by rioters in the Saltmarket; he died of his injuries on 1 June 1919. Military deployment Medium Mark C tanks and soldiers at the Glasgow Cattle Market in the Gallowgate The events of the day prompted the request for military assistance by the Sheriff of Lanarkshire (Alastair Oswald Morison Mackenzie, 1917-1933) the most senior locally based judge, also known as the Sheriff Principal. The deployment had already begun before the day's meeting of the War Cabinet, which convened at 3pm.CAB 23/9/9, 'War Cabinet, Minutes of Meeting 523, 31 January 1919' During that meeting Munro, Secretary for Scotland, described the demonstration as \\"a Bolshevist uprising\\". It was decided to deploy troops from Scotland and Northern England: troops from the local Maryhill barracks were not deployed because it was feared that men there might have sided with their neighbours. General Sir Charles Harington Harington, the Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the meeting that 6 tanks supported by 100 lorries were \\"going north that evening\\". It was stated that up to 12,000 troops could be deployed. It is sometimes suggested that the War Cabinet ordered this deployment, but this is incorrect: the government lacked the authority to deploy troops against British civilians without declaring martial law, which was not declared. The War Cabinet discussed the issue but the military deployment was in response to the request from the Sheriff of Lanarkshire. The first troops arrived that night,Evening News, 3 February 1919 with their numbers increasing over the next few days. The six Medium Mark C tanks, of the Royal Tank Regiment arrived from Bovington on Monday 3 February.Aberdeen Daily Journal (later Aberdeen Press & Journal), Tuesday 4 February 1919. \\"Tanks Reinforce Troops in Glasgow\\" Machine gun nests were placed in George Square. The Observer newspaper reported that \\"The city chambers is like an armed camp.'The quadrangle is full of troops and equipment, including machine guns.\\" The military arrived after the rioting was over and they played no active role in dispersing the protesters. The troops guarded locations of import to the civil authorities throughout the period of the strike, which lasted until 12 February. The troops and tanks then remained in Glasgow, and its surrounding areas, until 18 February.Glasgow Herald, Tuesday 18 February 1919. \\"Departure of Troops from Glasgow\\" Outcome Calm returned to the city by the Sunday. Despite the military deployment, there were no fatalities. With the strike over, the strikers gave up their cause for a 40-hour work week and therefore, by default, accepted the previously agreed 47 hours. Key members involved in the strike were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the events of the 31st. Only two ‚Äì William Gallacher and Emanuel Shinwell ‚Äì were convicted, and were sentenced to five months and three months in prison respectively. Some of those involved claim that this came close to being a successful revolution. Gallacher said \\"had there been an experienced revolutionary leadership, instead of a march to Glasgow Green there would have been a march to the city's Maryhill Barracks. There we could easily have persuaded the soldiers to come out, and Glasgow would have been in our hands.\\" Most historians now dispute this claim and argue that it was a reformist rather than revolutionary gathering. Gallacher always regretted not having taken a more revolutionary approach to the 40-hour strike and to the events in George Square in 1919, writing afterwards that, \\"We were carrying on a strike when we ought to have been making a revolution\\". Emanuel Shinwell, born to a Jewish immigrant family in London, ran in the municipal elections to the Glasgow Corporation following his release from prison. In the general election of 1922, the second election held after the passage of the Representation of the People Act 1918, Scotland elected 29 Labour MPs. Their number included the 40 Hour Strike organisers and Independent Labour Party members Manny Shinwell and David Kirkwood.The Times, 17 November 1922 The General Election of 1923 eventually saw the first Labour government come to power under Ramsay MacDonald.

In PD the dose needs to be adjusted to the effect and treatment should not be suddenly stopped. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, vomiting, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include pathological gambling, low blood pressure with standing and hallucinations. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is a dopamine agonist and works by triggering dopamine D2 receptors. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£34 per month as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$7.90. In 2017, it was the 108th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than six million prescriptions. Medical uses Ropinirole is prescribed for mainly Parkinson's disease, RLS and extrapyramidal symptoms. It can also reduce the side effects caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Parkinsonism syndrome as well as sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction caused by either SSRIs \\\\- \\"Treating Sexual Dysfunction From SSRI Medication: a Study Comparing Requip CR to Placebo\\" or antipsychotics. = Dosage = Ropinirole is available in various preparations, ranging from a 0.25 mg tablet to a 5 mg tablet. The primary reason is dose titration. For Parkinson's disease, the maximum recommended dose is 24 mg per day, taken in three separate doses spread throughout the day. The maximum dose recommendations of ropinirole for subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) should be reduced by 25% compared with those recommended for subjects with normal renal function. A 25% dose reduction represents a more straightforward dosage regimen in terms of available tablet strength, compared with a 30% dose reduction. For RLS, the maximum recommended dose is 4 mg per day, taken 1 to 3 hours before bedtime. A 52-week open label study had a mean dosage of 1.90 mg, once daily 1 to 3 hours before bedtime.  Side effects  Ropinirole can cause nausea, dizziness, hallucinations, orthostatic hypotension, and sudden sleep attacks during the daytime. Unusual side effects specific to D3 agonists such as ropinirole and pramipexole can include hypersexuality, punding and compulsive gambling, even in patients without a history of these behaviours. Ropinirole is also known to cause an effect known as \\"augmentation\\" when used to treat restless legs syndrome, where over time treatment with dopamine agonists will cause RLS symptoms to become more severe. This usually leads to constant dosage increases in an attempt to offset the symptom progression. Symptoms will return to the level of severity they were experienced at before treatment was initiated if the drug is stopped; however, both ropinirole and pramipexole are known to cause painful withdrawal effects when treatment is stopped and the process of taking a patient who has been using the medication long-term off of these drugs is often very difficult and generally should be supervised by a medical professional.https://www.rls.org/file/what-is-augmentation.pdf  Pharmacology  Ropinirole acts as a D2, D3, and D4 dopamine receptor agonist with highest affinity for D3, which are mostly found in the limbic areas. It is weakly active at the 5-HT2, and Œ±2 receptors and is said to have virtually no affinity for the 5-HT1, GABA, mAChRs, Œ±1, and Œ≤-adrenoreceptors. Ropinirole is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 to form two metabolites; SK&F-104557; and SK&F-89124;, both of which are renally excreted,An open- label, parallel-group, repeat-dose study to investigate the effects of end- stage renal disease and haemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ropinirole  Authors: Debra J.

Beethoven was famously difficult to get along with, and the history of his relationships with contemporaries is littered with arguments, misunderstandings, and reconciliations. Beethoven had well-known fallings out with his one-time teacher, Joseph Haydn, with the piano virtuoso and composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel, the German composer Carl Maria von Weber and the Italian violinist Niccol√≤ Paganini. Conversely, he regarded Franz Schubert positively, praising the latter's compositions on his deathbed. Luigi Cherubini Luigi Cherubini, 1850 Beethoven met the composer Luigi Cherubini on the latter's journey to Vienna in 1805. Cherubini, a longtime resident of Paris, was invited to mount a production of his opera Die Tage der Gefahr (or Der Wassertr√§ger) after the success of his 1791 opera Lodo√Øska, which was staged by Emanuel Schikaneder on 23 March 1803 at the Theater an der Wien. Cherubini's time in Vienna was generally unhappy, but he did have the opportunity to meet Beethoven. Cherubini was in attendance for the first performances of Beethoven's opera Fidelio, to which he reacted sneeringly. He also described Beethoven's piano style as \\"rough\\", and more famously the man himself as \\"an unlicked bear cub\\". It is remarkable, therefore, that Beethoven, normally so quick to take offence, named Cherubini as the greatest contemporary composer other than himself. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 1775 Beethoven had already read and studied Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's works intensively during his youth in Bonn, long before their first personal encounter. His first Goethe settings were produced around 1790. Beethoven announced his music to Egmont in a first letter to the poet in the spring of 1811 with the following words: \\"I am only able to approach you with the greatest veneration [and] with an inexpressibly deep feeling for your glorious creations.\\" He had already set 18 texts by Goethe, and two others were to follow. Goethe therefore occupies a privileged position in Beethoven's vocal works. Joseph Haydn Joseph Haydn, 1791 Perhaps the most important relationship in Beethoven's early life, and certainly the most famous, was the young pianist's tutorship under the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn. Beethoven studied with a number of composers and teachers in the period 1792‚Äì95, including Antonio Salieri and Johann Georg Albrechtsberger. However, of all Beethoven's teachers, Haydn enjoyed the greatest reputation, having just returned from his first successful voyage to London. Possibly as early as his first trip to London in 1790, Haydn agreed to take on Beethoven as a student. There is evidence that Haydn assigned his student composition exercises based on the Fux text Gradus ad Parnassum. During the course of the year, however, the relationship between the two men soured. According to contemporary accounts, the issue surfaced most notably upon the publication of Beethoven's first compositions, the Op. 1 piano trios. Wishing to assist the young composer, Haydn suggested that Beethoven include the phrase \\"pupil of Haydn\\" underneath his name in order to garner advantage from Haydn's considerable fame. There is generally strong evidence of Haydn's goodwill toward Beethoven, including an interest in taking his pupil with him on his second London voyage, and the personal missives Haydn sent to Beethoven's early patron, Maximilian Francis of Austria, Elector of Cologne. Beethoven, however, seems to have harbored ill-will toward Haydn during various points of his life. At the suggestion that he include the phrase \\"pupil of Haydn\\", Beethoven bristled. According to the account left by Ferdinand Ries, \\"Beethoven was unwilling to, because, as he said, although he had some instruction from Haydn, he had never learned anything from him.\\" The bad feelings produced by the Op. 1 Trios were compounded upon their first performance. Haydn, present in the audience, is reported to have recommended against the publication of the C minor Trio (Op. 1, No. 3) since he suspected the music would not gain public acceptance. Beethoven considered the C minor the best of the trios and interpreted Haydn's advice as an indication of his envy. Despite this, however, Beethoven and Haydn remained on relatively good terms until Haydn's death in 1809. Beethoven attended the concert in honor of Haydn's 76th birthday, and it is said that he \\"knelt down before Haydn and fervently kissed the hands and forehead of his old teacher\\". Haydn's towering reputation in Vienna made it hard for Beethoven to be openly antagonistic. However, Haydn was also genuinely admiring of Beethoven's compositions, a trait that usually succeeded in earning Beethoven's goodwill. In his renowned biography of Beethoven, Maynard Solomon notes that, in his later years, \\"Beethoven unfailingly referred to his old master in terms of reverence, regarding him as the equal\\" of Mozart and Bach. Johann Nepomuk Hummel Johann Nepomuk Hummel Johann Nepomuk Hummel, born in 1778, was a fixture in the Viennese musical world. A child prodigy and former pupil of Mozart, Hummel was renowned for his incredible virtuosity at the keyboard and legendary prowess at improvisation. Alongside Beethoven, he was widely considered the finest performer of his day. For many years, Hummel enjoyed a close friendship with Beethoven. Several incidents, however, marred their relationship. In one famous incident, Beethoven was invited by Prince Nikolaus II Esterhazy to write a mass for his wife in 1807. Beethoven agreed and produced the Mass in C, which was performed at the prince's estate in Eisenstadt. Hummel was at the time the Kapellmeister, having been appointed Haydn's successor to the Esterhazy court. The performance did not go well, and the prince is purported to have made a barbed remark to Beethoven afterwards. According to Schindler, Hummel laughed at the prince's words, compounding the always-sensitive Beethoven's feelings of humiliation and persecution. Beethoven promptly left Eisenstadt and carried the grudge for years afterward. This incident, however, likely did not prompt the eventual falling-out between the two men. A more likely source of contention between them was artistic. Hummel was well known for his keyboard arrangements of Beethoven's works, particularly his symphonies. Beethoven disliked Hummel's style of performance and composition, and, according to Ignaz Moscheles, objected to Hummel's arrangements. Some time in the late 1810s, disagreement surfaced, the exact cause of which is unknown, but which may well have centered on discord over Hummel's arrangements of Beethoven's music. Hummel spent most of the 1820s at the Weimar Court, where he was a friend of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and did not see Beethoven again until a remarkable reconciliation took place between the two men at Beethoven's deathbed. Hummel, hearing of Beethoven's serious illness, travelled from Weimar to Vienna to visit his erstwhile friend. According to the account left by Hummel's then-student Ferdinand Hiller, who accompanied his teacher, Hummel may have been motivated by more than compassion. Hummel solicited Beethoven's signature upon a petition he was taking to the Bundestag in order to protect his compositions (and those of others) from illegal copying. All told, Hummel visited Beethoven three times while he was on his deathbed, the last being on 23 March 1827, just three days before his death, and was present at his funeral.  Franz Liszt Franz Liszt On 13 April 1823, the twelve-year-old Hungarian pianist Franz Liszt (1811‚Äì1886) performed in Vienna. It was said that the 53-year-old Beethoven gave him a kiss ‚Äì the so-called Weihekuss, or 'kiss of consecration' ‚Äì for his marvellous playing. This is unlikely to be true, as Beethoven was profoundly deaf by this time. A more reasonable account of the Beethoven kiss event is reported in the reminiscences of the pianist Ilka Horovitz-Barnay: :\\"The most memorable time I experienced with Liszt was when he told me of his meeting with Beethoven. 'I was about eleven years old', he began, 'when my highly esteemed teacher Czerny introduced me to Beethoven. He had long before told him about me and had asked him to hear me play. But Beethoven had aversions against prodigies and for a long time refused to hear me. Finally though he was persuaded by my indefatigable teacher Czerny and said: \\"Then for God's sake ‚Äì bring the little rascal\\". :\\"'It was one morning about ten o'clock when we entered the two small rooms of the Schwarzspanierhaus, where Beethoven lived. I was somewhat embarrassed ‚Äì but Czerny kindly encouraged me. Beethoven was sitting by the window at a long narrow table working. For a moment he looked at us with a serious face, said a couple of quick words to Czerny but turned silent as my dear teacher signaled to me to go to the piano. :\\"'First I played a small piece of Ries [Ferdinand Ries, another pupil of Beethoven]. When I had finished Beethoven asked if I could play a fugue by Bach. I chose the C minor fugue from The Well-Tempered Clavier. \\"Can you transpose this fugue?\\" Beethoven asked. :\\"'Fortunately I could. After the finishing chord I looked up. Beethoven's deep glowing eyes rested upon me ‚Äì but suddenly a light smile flew over his otherwise serious face. He approached me and stroked me several times over my head with affection. ::\\"'\\"Well ‚Äì I'll be blowed\\" he whispered, \\"such a little devil\\". :\\"'Suddenly my courage rose: \\"May I play one of your pieces?\\" I asked with audacity. Beethoven nodded with a smile. I played the first movement of his C major piano concerto [No. 1]. When I had finished Beethoven stretched out his arms, kissed me on my forehead and said in a soft voice: ::\\"'\\"You go on ahead. You are one of the lucky ones! It will be your destiny to bring joy and delight to many people and that is the greatest happiness one can achieve\\"'. :\\"Liszt told me this with great emotion; his voice trembled but you could feel what divine joy these simple words had given him. Never did Liszt ‚Äì the human being ‚Äì make a greater impression on me. The flamboyant man-of-the-world, the revered artist was gone; this great moment he had experienced in his childhood still resounded in his soul. For a little while he was silent ‚Äì then he said quietly: ::\\"'This was the proudest moment in my life ‚Äì the inauguration to my life as artist. I tell this very rarely ‚Äì and only to special friends.'\\" This story is somewhat more convincing, although Beethoven was just as deaf in 1822 as in 1823. It is possible, however, to speculate that Beethoven felt the vibrations of the piano with his hands as he is said to have been able to do, as well as observe Liszt's fingerings. Also, at the time it is meant to have occurred Beethoven was not residing in the Schwarzspanierhaus ‚Äì but when Liszt told this story he was in his latter years, and his memory may have been a little foggy, if the story itself was not a confabulation. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1780-81 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791) was already an accomplished and renowned composer in Vienna when the then 16-year-old Beethoven first visited the city in 1787. The two may have met during Beethoven's six-month stay there, although there are no contemporary documents that provide any evidence for this. According to secondary accounts given by writer Otto Jahn, Beethoven was taken to meet Mozart and played for him. Beethoven may also have received lessons from Mozart. The uncertainty over their meeting notwithstanding, Beethoven was certainly aware of Mozart's work and was heavily influenced by it. For example, the third movement of Beethoven's 5th Symphony has an opening theme that is very similar to that of the fourth movement of Mozart's 40th Symphony. Beethoven wrote cadenzas (WoO 58) to the first and third movements of Mozart's Piano Concerto in D minor. Gioachino Rossini Gioachino Rossini Gioachino Rossini (1792‚Äì1868) was an Italian composer known for his numerous operas including The Barber of Seville and William Tell. When Rossini visited Vienna, he made several attempts to meet Beethoven, who was then 51 and in failing health. Finally, Rossini was able to arrange a meeting with Beethoven through the help of Giuseppe Carpani, an Italian poet living in Vienna. According to various accounts, Beethoven recognized Rossini and complimented him on The Barber of Seville, adding that he should never try to write anything other than opera buffa (comedy operas) as that would be against his (Rossini's) nature. When Carpani reminded Beethoven that Rossini had already composed several serious operas, Beethoven is reported to have said, \\"Yes, I looked at them. Opera seria (serious opera) is ill-suited to the Italians. You do not know how to deal with real drama.\\"  Franz Schubert Franz Schubert, 1825 Franz Schubert (1797‚Äì1828) lived most of his short life in Vienna, during the height of Beethoven's popularity. He was exposed to Beethoven's music from an early age, and several of his works contain thematic resemblance to similar works of Beethoven. Even though both Schubert and Beethoven resided in the same city, and Schubert held Beethoven in the highest of esteem, they moved, for the most part, in different social circles for most of that time. Their first meeting was apparently in 1822, when Schubert, accompanied by the publisher Anton Diabelli, visited Beethoven. Schubert had dedicated a set of Variations on a French Song (Op. 10, D.624) to Beethoven, and wanted to present the dedicatee with a copy. Schubert was apparently nervous during the interview, and nearly lost all sense of composure when the older man pointed out a minor problem in the work. This story is recounted by Anton Schindler, and is of unknown authenticity, as Schindler is known to be an unreliable biographer of Beethoven. Schubert's friend Josef H√ºttenbrenner claims that Beethoven was not home when Schubert called, and the variations were left with the house staff. However, Johann Friedrich Rochlitz, the publisher of the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung, recounts an 1822 meeting of his with Schubert, in which Schubert claims to have discussed Rochlitz with Beethoven, and described other details of a meeting.Duncan, pp. 39‚Äì42 When Beethoven was on his deathbed in 1827, Schindler, to give Beethoven some distractions, gave him manuscripts for a number of Schubert's songs. Beethoven was, according to Schindler, astonished at the quantity and quality of what he saw, claiming that \\"Truly in Schubert there is the divine spark.\\"Duncan, p. 60 Schubert would visit Beethoven on his death bed more than once. On one visit, when Schubert called with Anselm H√ºttenbrenner, Beethoven remarked, \\"You, Anselm have my mind, but Franz has my soul.\\"Duncan, p. 61 Schubert would serve as a torch-bearer at Beethoven's funeral.  Johann Sedlatzek Ninth Symphony. Johann Sedlatzek is the principal flautist. Johann Sedlatzek (1789‚Äì1866) was a flute virtuoso of the 19th century born in the Silesian city of Oberglogau, now Glogowek, Poland, who spent most of his life performing in Vienna and London. Beethoven first met Sedlatzek during his visit to Silesia in 1806 at the Castle of Count Franz von Oppersdorff where Sedlatzek played in the Royal Court Orchestra.History of Oberglogau in Brief. \\"http://www.smarzly.de/6.html\\". Smarzly 2003. The Count was known to be a passionate patron of music who not only commissioned Beethoven's Symphony No. 4 which was dedicated to him,Naughtin, Matthew (2002). Symphony No. 4 in B-flat major, Op. 60, Program Notes. \\"www.mattnaughtin.com\\" San Francisco Ballet, 2002.

Oppersdorff recruited the young tailor/musician to play in his court orchestra, allowing Johann the opportunity to perform for Beethoven during the Master's stay in Silesia in the fall of 1806.Rostropowicz, Joanna (2007). Glogowek Online Sobota, 14 September 2007. The introduction of Sedlatzek to Beethoven at this time marked the beginning of a musical partnership which would endure throughout Beethoven's final years. Johann Sedlatzek was the principal flautist at the K√§rntnertortheater in Vienna during the world premiere performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 on 7 May 1824 under the direction of Beethoven.Powell, Ardal(11 August 2003) The Flute.

Traversieres, 1999. As witnessed by the English conductor Sir George Thomas Smart, who visited Beethoven's home in Vienna in 1825, Sedlatzek was a member of Beethoven's inner circle, which included, according to Sir George's letters, such notable musicians as Czerny, Lincke, Schlesinger, and Schuppanzigh.Smart, George Thomas, Sir (1907). \\"https://archive.org/stream/leavesfromjourna00smar#page/n7/mode/2up\\".

Call number DCK2331 Beethoven apparently held Sedlatzek's musicianship in high regard, as evidenced by the personal letters of recommendation Sedlatzek carried with him during his solo tour of Paris in 1826. In a letter directed to French violinist and composer Rudolph Kreutzer (1766‚Äì1831), Beethoven called Sedlatzek \\"...a most distinguished artist\\". In a letter presented to Luigi Cherubini (1760‚Äì1842), the Italian composer who lived most of his life in France, Beethoven said of Sedlatzek: \\"I am convinced of his esteem as an artist worthy of my name, and hope for a favorable welcome from you. Accept him with the highest assurance...\\"Beethoven, Ludwig Van. 15 November 1825. The Complete Letters of Beethoven. Published by Wein, C.W. Stern, 1907. The association with Beethoven continued as far as Johann's grandson, Ludwig Sedlaczek (1875 in Vienna ‚Äì 1965 in the US), who also became a musician and composer. The young Ludwig learned the craft of music by practising on a piano once owned and played by Beethoven.Obituary of Ludwig Sedlaczek(1965). The Courier-Journal News, USA, October 1965. Beethoven's visit to Silesia in 1806 is celebrated annually with the Silesian Beethoven Music Festival held each autumn in Glogowek, Poland. The 2012 edition of the Beethoven Festival in Glogowek featured performances of several compositions by Johann Sedlatzek which had been lost for nearly 200 years until being discovered in London archives in the Spring of 2012.

History Fayette County High School is at its fourth location. The first two buildings burned: the first in the 1930s, and the second on March 4, 1954. Before 1954, Fayette County offered no secondary education to its African-American citizens. After the 1954 fire, Fayette County built two high schools in different locations: the white Fayette County High School on Lafayette Avenue, and the black Fayette County Training School on Booker Avenue. When Georgia integrated its public schools in 1969, black students moved to Fayette County High, and the old Fayette County Training School became Eastside Elementary School. In the mid-1990s, Fayette County High moved into a new campus across Tiger Trail from the old school. The building that had housed FCHS from 1955 to 1995 is now home to Fayette Community School. For about twenty years after the 1954 fire, Fayette County's football team played home games on a field behind the remains of the burned school building. The field has been converted into the school system's school bus parking lot. The current football field's concrete home stands were constructed in the late 1970s. In 2016, Tiger Stadium received an upgraded pressbox and restrooms on the home side, and all- new away stands. In 2017, all of Fayette County's public high schools installed artificial turf fields at their football stadiums.

It was released in October 1984, through Tyfon Grammofon. It is considered by fans and critics to be one of the contenders for the first black metal record.  Background and recording  Bathory had been formed in 1983. The band's frontman, Quorthon, worked part-time at the small record label Tyfon. In late 1983 and early 1984, the label was putting together a compilation of songs by Scandinavian metal bands. However, at the last minute, one of the bands backed out. Tyfon agreed to let Bathory appear on the record as a replacement, and the band recorded two songs for the compilation‚Äî\\"Sacrifice\\" and \\"The Return of the Darkness and Evil\\"‚Äîin January. The album, Scandinavian Metal Attack, was released in March 1984 and was Bathory's first appearance on record. To everyone's surprise, over 95% of fan mail sent to the label after the record's release was dedicated to Bathory. Tyfon asked the band to record a full-length album. His bandmates having moved away, Quorthon recruited Rickard Bergman as bassist and Stefan Larsson as drummer. On 22 May 1984, they had their first and only rehearsal together before recording the album. Here they recorded the songs \\"Satan My Master\\" and \\"Witchcraft\\", which would later appear on the compilation album Jubileum Volume III. On 14 June the band entered Heavenshore Studio in Stockholm‚Äîa converted garage‚Äîto record the debut. The studio had a homemade eight-channel tape recorder. Due to the band's tight budget, they ran the recorder at half-speed to fit everything on one master tape. They also had to work quickly ‚Äì the recording and mixing were done in somewhere between 32 and 56 hours. = Album artwork = The album was originally to be named Pentagrammaton and to have a pentagram on the cover, but this name was scrapped when several people misread it as Pentagon. The pentagram was moved to the back and replaced with a re-touched portion of a drawing made by Joseph A. Smith in 1981 for the book Witches by Erica Jong. For the writing on the back cover, Quorthon bought a set of rub-on letters in the Old English font; however, he was one letter short ('C'), and as a result, the second 'C' in \\"Necromancy\\" was replaced with an 'S'. The introduction, \\"Storm of Damnation\\", and the outro was also mistakenly left off the track listing. The goat on the album cover, taken from a drawing by Joseph Smith, was originally meant to be printed in gold. However, this was too expensive to use, so Quorthon asked for it to be as near to gold as possible; the result was more of a yellowish color. According to Swedish Death Metal, Quorthon thought it looked \\"awful\\", and after the first 1000 pressings it was switched to black-and-white. The yellow cover has become a collector's item, and is now well known as \\"Gula Geten\\" (\\"The Yellow Goat\\"). = Musical style = Daniel Ekeroth, author of the book Swedish Death Metal, described the album's style as \\"basically a mix of the Satanic party rock of Venom and the energy of San Francisco thrash metal\\". While Bathory leader Quorthon claimed to have not heard Venom before making the album and to be inspired by Black Sabbath, Mot√∂rhead and GBH,Lahtinen, Luxi: An Epic Interview with Quorthon. 2001. Accessed on 2 October 2012. former drummer Jonas √Ökerlund claimed that Bathory was \\"exclusively\\" inspired by Venom during these days.  Release and reception  Bathory was released in October 1984 and sold out its subsequent pressing of 1000 in two weeks. The album has since gained a cult notoriety. Bathory was reissued in 1990 through Black Mark Production. AllMusic critic Rob Ferrier wrote: \\"The music itself has a certain lo-fi charm, and if you're into this sort of thing the raw power of this debut cannot be ignored.\\" Also writing for AllMusic, Eduardo Rivadavia has stated that the record and its follow-up The Return‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ were \\"so inaccessible, so unprecedented in their abrasive anti- commercialism, as to be ahead of their time, carving a niche all their own within this quickly developing subgenre.\\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff called the album \\"a cruel joke but a historically poignant one\\" and remarked how, despite striving \\"to be the leading edge of repellent extreme\\", Quorthon's debut is very musical \\"versus the black-hearted Norwegian acts\\" that would cite him as a main influence.

A properly executed, timely filed reaffirmation agreement modifies the discharge such that it is rendered inoperable against the subject debt. Most statutory authority for reaffirmation agreements is codified at (c).  Overview  A debtor may wish to pay a debt, even though that debt would be discharged in bankruptcy. For example, a debtor may wish to keep a vehicle. As a promise to pay that debt, a debtor must enter into a reaffirmation agreement with the creditor. Reaffirmations are voluntary and not required by law. It is recommended that the debtor carefully consider whether or not the agreed upon payments can be made before entering into a reaffirmation agreement. If a debtor is not delinquent on payments and chooses not to sign a reaffirmation agreement, many lenders will recognize the option to retain and pay the debt by continuing the regular monthly payments. However, this option is not recognized by all lenders, so it is important to know the lender's stance on reaffirming debt versus the retain and pay option. Any agreement to reaffirm must be made before the discharge is entered. If you are in the process of reaffirming a debt and feel it will not be filed before the discharge deadline, notify the clerk's office in writing to delay entry of the discharge until the reaffirmation is filed. Reaffirmations are strictly voluntary. If you wish to reaffirm (agree to pay back) any particular debt, you must enter into a written agreement with the creditor, which legally obligates you to pay all or a portion of a dischargeable (wiped out by the bankruptcy) debt. The form for this is Form 240A Reaffirmation Agreement. The creditor and debtor must fully complete the form indicating the nature of the debt, the value of the collateral, and the reason for reaffirmation. Both parties to the reaffirmation must sign on the appropriate signature lines. Since you are not represented by an attorney, the reaffirmation will be automatically set for hearing and you will receive written notice of the hearing date and time. You must appear at the hearing where the judge will determine if it is in your best interests to reaffirm, based on your circumstances and the nature of the reaffirmation. For example, the court may not allow you to reaffirm a debt of $3,000 for a vehicle that may be worth $1,000. If a debtor reaffirms a debt and fails to pay it, the debt remains owed as though there were no bankruptcy and the creditor can take action to collect the debt. This reaffirmed debt is not discharged or wiped out by the bankruptcy filing. The Court does not need to approve a reaffirmation agreement which applies to consumer debt secured by real estate. This applies to any mortgages on your home or other debts secured by your home. In addition, the Court does not approve any reaffirmation agreements between debtors and credit unions. They are filed and become part of the record without a hearing. You have the right to cancel (rescind) any reaffirmation at any time prior to the entry of your discharge or within 60 days after the reaffirmation agreement is filed with the court, whichever occurs later. To rescind a reaffirmation agreement, you must mail a written notice to the creditor stating that you are withdrawing your decision to reaffirm and revoking the agreement. Send the original letter to the creditor and a copy to the clerk's office to be made part of your file. ''' Completion of Reaffirmation Agreement Form''' All reaffirmations must be filed with Official Form B27, the reaffirmation cover sheet. The Reaffirmation Agreement (Official Form B240A) has been amended effective December 1, 2009. In order to allow filers sufficient time to implement the form change, the Court will allow a six-month transition period during which time either the old (1/07), or new (12/09), versions of the Reaffirmation Agreement may be filed. Note: Effective April 1, 2010, the newly amended Reaffirmation Agreement form will become mandatory. All pro se reaffirmation agreements that do not involve credit unions or real estate will be automatically set for hearing, regardless of whether a presumption of undue hardship has arisen. If the reaffirmation agreement involves real estate and/or a credit union, no further action will be taken. The January 2007 Reaffirmation Agreement is divided into various parts: Parts A-E - consisting of the Debtor's Disclosures, Reaffirmation Agreement, Attorney Certification, Debtor's Statement in Support of Reaffirmation, and Motion for Court Approval make up the document required to reaffirm a debt. Instructions appear within the reaffirmation agreement form. Part A - Debtor's Disclosures: Summary of Reaffirmation Agreement. Complete this section giving details of the agreement: Amount to be reaffirmed, percentage rate, payment to be made. Part B - The Reaffirmation Agreement Requires signature(s) of both the representative of the creditor and the debtor(s). Part C - Certification by Debtor's Attorney - Not Applicable for a Pro Se Debtor Part D - The Debtor's Statement in Support of the Reaffirmation. Debtor's signature required! This section indicates to the Court that the debtor can make the payments without undue hardship. If there is a presumption of undue hardship, the debtor can explain how the hardship will be overcome. Part E is the Debtor's Motion for Court Approval and must be signed by Debtors who are not represented by an attorney. ''' Defective Reaffirmation Agreements''' A reaffirmation agreement will be considered defective and will be stricken if: ‚Ä¢ It is not filed on Official Form 240 A(1/07), or if ‚Ä¢ The debtor and/or creditor fails to sign any of the required parts of the agreement. A reaffirmation agreement will be considered defective if Part E is not completed. Failure to submit a completed Part E within the deficiency period (15 days) will result in the agreement being stricken.

Despite being known for his catchphrases, Johnson also utilizes silence at opportune times to let television viewers absorb the moment, such as during a 2015 collge football matchup between Notre Dame and Stanford when Stanford kicked the game-winning field goal at the end of a high-scoring game. =Notable calls= As Knicks Announcer ‚Äì With the Knicks, he was well known for some of his calls. For example, one famous Gus line occurs after Knicks forward Al Harrington scores: \\"My name is Al Harrington... And I get Buckets!\\" Perhaps Johnson's most famous Knicks call was his enthusiastic and exciting call during Allan Houston's last second shot to knock off the top-seeded Miami Heat in the first round of the 1999 playoffs, en route to an unlikely NBA Finals appearance. March 23, 2006 ‚Äì During the 2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, Johnson was calling the Sweet 16 matchup between UCLA and Gonzaga. Gonzaga held a 71‚Äì70 lead with just 19.7 seconds left in the game, needing to wind the clock down while passing the ball in from its own side of the court: > Johnson: They give it to Morrison. He holds on. > Analyst Len Elmore: You don't want to foul Morrison. You make them get it > over halfcourt, you know you gotta foul- [UCLA guard Jordan Farmar steals > the ball from Gonzaga forward J. P. Batista] Woah! > Johnson: And a steal! Farmar! Inside...the freshman- [nearly inaudible over > the crowd cheering as UCLA forward Luc Mbah a Moute scores a layup] Oh and > they go in front! Raivio! Last chance to dance! [inaudible as UCLA steals > the ball via a jump ball again before Gonzaga commits a foul, leaving just > over 2 seconds left] > Elmore: Unbelievable! > Johnson: Oh what a game! What a game! UCLA! > Elmore: Are you kidding me?! > Johnson: After being down by 17! Heartbreak city! Following this sequence, Gonzaga had one last chance to score a game-winning basket, once again throwing the ball in from its side of the court. > Johnson: And they'll go ahead and throw it. Batista with THE CAATCH! > [Batista shoots before the buzzer, but misses] And that's it! WHAT A > COMEBACK! UCLA defeats Gonzaga 73‚Äì71 after being down 17! As the game wound up having a tight finish, Johnson received praise for his enthusiastic announcing, earning the nickname \\"Screaming Gus Johnson\\". CBS Sports host Greg Gumbel later joked that Johnson would be \\"out of the hospital\\" by the next game. September 14, 2009 ‚Äì Johnson was calling an NFL regular season opening game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Denver Broncos. During the waning seconds of the game, Denver, down 6‚Äì7, needed to drive down the field to get into field goal range or score a touchdown. Quarterback Kyle Orton threw a pass to receiver Brandon Marshall near the sideline. Though the ball was tipped by Bengals defender Leon Hall, it landed into the hands of Broncos receiver Brandon Stokley, who ran it in for an improbable game-winning touchdown. Johnson's call of the play is as follows: > Johnson: Second down and 10 at the 13 [yard line]. > Analyst Dan Fouts: In other words, about 60 yards [to get into field goal > range]. > Johnson: Orton in the gun, Buckhalter next to him. Orton... pumps again to > the sideline... batted up- OH CAUGHT! STOKLEY! DOWN THE SIDELINE! CAN HE > CATCH HIM!? STOKLEY! WOW! [Pause] Touchdown Denver! Unbelievable! [pause] Oh > my goodness! What a play! 87 yards! [pause] Woah!\\" In a later interview on The Dan Patrick Show, Johnson later explained of the play: \\"I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. It was the most incredible thing. I‚Äôve seen a lot of great things in sports. I started doing this in 1990, but I‚Äôve never seen anything; not like in that in football. I mean wow.\\" November 1, 2009 ‚Äì Johnson was calling another regular season NFL game, this time between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans when Titans running back Chris Johnson broke away for a 52-yard touchdown. This was Gus Johnson's call: > First down and 10... Johnson... gets a shoulder he's- WOW! Watch out! He's > got gettin' away from the cops speed! Touchdown! [pause] 52 yards! Though Gus Johnson received some criticism for this call, it has nonetheless become one of his most famous, as Complex magazine named it his top call in 2013. November 14, 2010 ‚Äì Johnson called a miracle play during a game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans where Jaguars QB David Garrard threw a 50-yard Hail Mary intended for Mike Sims-Walker, but it was batted by Houston safety Glover Quin into the hands of Mike Thomas, whereupon Thomas stepped into the end zone and scored a game-winning touchdown: > Johnson: Garrard, steps up. Fires, Mike Sims-Walker! Knocked down! > Analyst Steve Tasker: Oh, he caught it! > Johnson: OHHHHHH! UNBELIEVABLE! Mike Thomas! Touchdown Jags! Ballgame! 50 > yards! Woah! HA HAAAAAA! December 5, 2015 ‚Äì Johnson was the play-by-play announcer for Fox Sports's coverage of the 2015 Big Ten Football Championship Game between the number 5 ranked Michigan State Spartans and the number 4 ranked Iowa Hawkeyes, where Michigan State defeated 16‚Äì13, with true freshman running back LJ Scott powering his way for a touchdown with 27 seconds left in the game, giving Michigan State a berth in the 2016 College Football Playoff. Johnson's call of Scott's touchdown: > LJ Scott the deep man... LJ Scott running right! NO, HE DIDN'T GET IN! OR > DID HE? YES! TOUCHDOWN SPARTANS! WHAT STRENGTH, BY THE TRUE FRESHMAN! September 3, 2017 ‚Äì Johnson was the play-by-play announcer for the Week 1 matchup between the Texas A&M; Aggies and the UCLA Bruins, where UCLA came back from a 34 point deficit to win 45‚Äì44, capped off by a fake spike touchdown from Josh Rosen to Jordan Lasley with 43 seconds left to go. Johnson's play of the call: > Rosen fakes the spike... in the endzone, TOUCHDOWN! WOAH! Jordan Lasley! The > legend of Josh Rosen... in full bloom! Dan Marino would be proud! October 17, 2017 ‚Äì As the play-by-play announcer of a college football game between Ohio State and Maryland, Johnson added some playful commentary after Ohio State cornerback Denzel Ward laid a vicious hit on Maryland receiver Taivon Jacobs. Though the play ultimately resulted in Ward's ejection from the game, Johnson's enthusiasm was noted: > Second down after the 7-yard gain... [Maryland quarterback] Bortenschlager > to the sideline, caught, first down. [Ward levels Jacobs, causing a fumble] > Whoo! What a hit! Denzel Ward! You've got barbecue back there, and you > didn't invite me? Hurt! My! Feelings! December 8, 2018 ‚Äì Johnson called the 2018 Citi Hoops Classic match-up between the Seton Hall Pirates and the 9th ranked Kentucky Wildcats at Madison Square Garden, where Keldon Johnson took a pass from P. J. Washington and made a half-court shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 70. Johnson's call of the final seconds of regulation: > Here's P.J. Washington, he can run the baseline. Throws it, midcourt, Keldon > Johnson! [buzzer sounds] OHH! HE BURIED IT! WOW! AND WE'RE ‚Äì LEVEL AT 70! > Whoo! Unbelieveable. And we're going to overtime... at the Garden!

It is operated by the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 507th Infantry, United States Army Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia. The Airborne School conducts the Basic Airborne Course, which is open to troops of both genders from all branches of the United States Department of Defense, Reserve Officer Training Corps, and allied military personnel. All students must volunteer to attend the course. History C-47, from the 75th Troop Carrier Squadron, at Lawson Field (circa August 1946). In 1940, the War Department approved the formation of a test platoon of Airborne Infantry under the direction and control of the Army's Infantry Board. A test platoon of volunteers was organized from Fort Benning's 29th Infantry Regiment, and the 2nd Infantry Division was directed to conduct tests to develop reference data and operational procedures for air-transported troops. First Lieutenant William T. Ryder volunteered and was made the test platoon's platoon leader, Lieutenant James A. Bassett was designated assistant platoon leader, and forty-eight enlisted men were selected from a pool of 200 volunteers. The platoon moved into tents near Lawson Army Airfield, and an abandoned hangar was obtained for training and parachute packing. Lieutenant Colonel William C. Lee, a staff officer for the Chief of Infantry, recommended that the test platoon be moved to the Safe Parachute Company at Hightstown, NJ and train using parachute drop towers from the 1939 New York World's Fair. Eighteen days after forming, the platoon was moved to New Jersey and trained for one week on the 250-foot free towers, which proved to be particularly effective ‚Äì drops from the tower added realism otherwise impossible to duplicate outside of an airplane drop, and proved to the troopers that their parachutes would function safely. Impressed, the Army purchased two and erected them on what is now Eubanks Field at Fort Benning. Two more were later added, and today three of the original four towers are still in use. Parachute landing training was often conducted by the volunteers jumping from PT platforms and from the back of moving trucks to allow the trainees to experience the shock of landing. Less than forty-five days after it was formed, members of the test platoon made their first jump from a Douglas B-18 Bolo bomber over Lawson Field on 16 August 1940. Lieutenant Ryder and Private William N. (Red) King became the first officer and enlisted man to make an official jump as paratroopers in the United States Army. On 29 August, the platoon made the first platoon mass jump held in the United States. Members of the original test platoon formed the battalion cadre of the 501st Parachute Battalion, the first parachute combat unit. The second, the 502nd Parachute Infantry Battalion, was activated on 1 July 1941. As more airborne units were activated, a centralized training facility was organized at Fort Benning on 15 May 1942. Over time, the U.S. Army Parachute School has been known by a variety of names: * The Airborne School (1 January 1946) * Airborne Army Aviation Section, The Infantry School (1 November 1946) * Airborne Department, The Infantry School (February 1955) * Airborne-Air Mobility Department (February 1956) * Airborne Department (August 1964) * Airborne-Air Mobility Department (October 1974) * Airborne Department (October 1976) * HHC, 4th Student Battalion (Airborne), The School Brigade (January 1982) * HHC, 1st Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, The School Brigade (October 1985) * HHC, 1st Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, attached to HQ, 11th Infantry Regiment (July 1991) * 1st Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade (April 2014) History of the 1‚Äì507th Parachute Infantry Regiment The former 4th Student Battalion (Airborne), The School Brigade provided command and control of Airborne School students from the 1960s until October 1985. During its existence, it was organized with a Battalion Headquarters and up to nine numbered companies, designated the 41st to 49th Student Companies. In the 1960s and 1970s, each Airborne Class normally included students from two different companies. By January 1982, the battalion was organized with an HHC (which took over the mission of the former Airborne Department), and the 41st to 45th Student Companies, with each Student Company providing command and control for one complete Airborne Class. In October 1985, the assets of the 4th Student Battalion (Airborne) were used to reactivate the 1st Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, as part of the implementation of the U.S. Army Regimental System (USARS). The 1st Bn, 507th PIR was originally organized with six companies: Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), to provide administrative support and conduct the Pathfinder and Jumpmaster Courses; four Line Companies (A, B, C, and D) to conduct the Basic Airborne Course; and Company E, a parachute rigger support company. Company D has since been inactivated. CurriculumGround week= Students practicing PLFs in the sawdust pits during the Basic Airborne Course's ground week. The first week of the Basic Airborne Course is dedicated to teaching prospective troopers how to land properly to minimize the potential for injury and general familiarization with the T-10D and T-11 parachute. The T-10D is a round-shaped parachute, and the T-11 is a square-shaped parachute both using static line extraction with a descent rate of 18‚Äì23 ft/sec and 16‚Äì20 ft/sec respectively, dependent on the weight and equipment outfitting of the individual jumper. Prospective troopers are taught how to wear the parachute harness correctly and how to use the special training gear. During Ground Week, prospective troopers will spend the majority of time learning, practicing, and perfecting their Parachute Landing Fall (PLF) and proper exit technique from the aircraft. To practice the PLFs, soldiers will jump from platforms of various heights into sand or pebble pits, simulating the final stage of parachute landing. This maneuver teaches a soldier to transfer the energy of his fall (landing) up the sides of the lower legs and knees, all the way up to side of the upper body. During this period Black Hat instructors closely observe and correct the prospective troopers body position and technique making corrections. This week culminates in practice landings from the Lateral Drift Assembly, a 'zip line' type assembly which simulates making contact with the ground traveling at speed and in various directions. In many cases the first use of the 34-foot tower is made at the end of this period of training. To continue to week 2, prospective troopers must pass all jump training test as well as the standard Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) in the 17‚Äì21 year old range, regardless of the prospective trooper's actual age. Ground week is the phase of training in which the largest number of personnel wash out. Depending on circumstances personnel who fail to advance are either dismissed from the course outright or less commonly recycled back to an earlier class for additional training. =Tower week= Students drop from the 250 foot tower in T-10 parachutes during tower week. The second week of Jump School concentrates on the jump towers. Prospective troopers will continue using the 34-foot tower in addition to the swing-landing trainer, a suspended harness trainer, and occasionally the 250-foot tower. Soldiers will become familiar with the mock door trainer to simulate mass exit training (how to exit an aircraft in flight). Additionally, prospective troopers are taught the different phases of parachute flight from aircraft exit, through opening shock and chute deployment, then onto the deployment of the risers, steering the chute, and all the way to landing. One critical skill learned is how to identify a parachute malfunction and deal with it. This may involve emergency procedures including when and how to deploy the reserve parachute. Soldiers also learn about oscillation, landing falls, and how to recover from drag. The T-10D and T-11 parachutes are partially steerable using the parachute risers and students are taught the different techniques to steer their chutes into the wind and aim for the Point of Impact at the center of the Drop Zone. The second week completes a soldier's individual skill training and begins building team effort skills. Once successfully completing the skills required and the physical fitness requirements, a soldier progresses to jump week. =Jump week= A student exits an aircraft at 1,250 feet with the T-11 parachute during the first parachute drop of jump week. This was the first time the new T-11 was used at the Airborne School (circa March 2010). Finally, soldiers get to practice their new skills while jumping out of aircraft in flight. The C-130 or C-17 aircraft pick up the paratrooper students in front of the hangar at Lawson Army Airfield. From there it is a very short flight to Fryar Field (commonly referred to as \\"Fryar Drop Zone\\"), where all of the training jumps are accomplished. Fryar Field is named after Private Elmer E. Fryar of the United States Army's 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment, who posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his actions in World War II. The Air Force aircraft fly at 1250 feet above the ground at an airspeed of about 130 knots. After the flight crew completes the pre-drop and slow-down checklists, soldiers rise out of their seats and move at the jumpmaster's direction to one of two paratroop doors (on each side of the aircraft). At \\"green light\\" one stick of soldiers exits the plane ‚Äì jumpers continue to move to the door until the red light is illuminated. At that point the aircraft will begin its racetrack maneuver circling back to the beginning of the drop zone and continue to do this until all jumpers have jumped. A soldier must complete 5 jumps, normally including at least one night jump, to graduate Airborne School. During jump week, the schedule varies and soldiers will jump in a variety of configurations from unloaded Hollywood to fully equipped and loaded Combat jumps. Jump week can seem chaotic, with a large group of soldiers gathered in the ready-room waiting to be loaded onto the aircraft one chalk at a time. Immediately after landing on the Drop Zone (DZ), the soldiers collect their parachutes and other gear and meet back at the rally point on one side of the DZ, where they wait for a bus to take them back to Lawson Army Airfield to get ready for their next jump. The jump schedule varies greatly based on class dynamics, weather, and aircraft. Graduation is normally conducted at 0900 on Friday of Jump Week at the south end of Eubanks Field on the Airborne Walk. However, if there is inclement weather, or other factors delay the scheduled jumps, graduation may be conducted on Fryar Drop Zone following the last jump. Guests and family members are welcome to observe all of the jumps at the DZ, attend the graduation ceremony, and participate in awarding the parachutist wings to the soldiers. On graduation day, families typically spend only a few minutes with their soldier, pinning on his or her new airborne wings. The soldier frequently departs Fort Benning that day or the following day, to attend another advanced military school or to report to another duty station. PersonnelInstructors= A special skills instructor, known as a \\"Black Hat,\\" conducts Jumpmaster Personnel Inspection The Airborne School instructors are commonly referred to as \\"Black Hats\\", due to the distinguishing black baseball caps with shiny brass rank insignia and parachutist badge that is part of the instructor's uniform. However, all students at the school are required to address them as \\"Sergeant (or Petty Officer in the case of a Navy instructor) Airborne\\". A student's interaction with Black Hats consists largely of shouting, \\"clear Sergeant, Airborne!\\", and \\"not clear Sergeant, Airborne!\\" instead of yes or no. Instructors come predominately from the United States Army, however the Marine Corps, Navy or Air Force also provide instructors. The Airborne School has US Army Black Hat cadre and additional instructors from the USN, USMC, and USAF to train students in the use of the static line deployed parachutes. The reasoning is that because students from four military services attend the training, each service insists that they have at least one representative to ensure quality instruction. =Students= The vast majority of students at Airborne School come from the U.S. Army. These include soldiers headed for assignments to the 82nd Airborne Division, XVIII Airborne Corps and its subordinate units, 4th BCT 25th Infantry Division, 173rd Airborne BCT, United States Special Operations Command and its further subordinate units, 1st Battalion 509th Infantry Regiment, the 1st Battalion 143rd Infantry Regiment of the Texas ARNG, divisional Long Range Surveillance Units, the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program, or the Special Forces Qualification Course. Marine Recon units as well as ANGLICO Units also attend. Recent BUD/S graduates, Navy EOD, USAF Combat Controllers, USAF Special Operations Weather Technicians, USAF Pararescuemen and USAF Tactical Air Control Party also attend the school in order to be jump-qualified. Summer cycles frequently include a substantial numbers of Army ROTC and West Point cadets along with occasional cadets from other service academies and college ROTC programs. Summer classes can swell to 600+ candidates. The US Coast Guard does not usually participate in Airborne training, as it does not directly relate to the service's Homeland Security and daily search-and-rescue (SAR) missions. During in-processing, each student is given a roster number (with the prefix C, N, or A to identify a cadet, NCO, or officer, respectively, or simply a 3 digit number with no prefix for junior enlisted personnel), which is applied to the student's assigned equipment and used as identification throughout training. All students are quartered in gender-segregated company barracks for the entire course except for officers, warrant officers, and senior non-commissioned officers (E7 and above), who are assigned to bachelor officer's quarters. In December 1973 Pvt. Rita Johnson and Pvt. Janice Kutch became the first women to graduate from the Basic Airborne Course. They graduated from the 43rd Co., 4th Battalion, TSB. Upon satisfactory completion of the course, the student is awarded: *United States Army Parachutist Badge (commonly referred to as \\"Jump Wings\\") *Orders certificating authorizing its wear of the badge *P ASI (Additional Skill Identifier) regardless of branch of service or MOS.

It is in the Sierra Nevada and east of the Sierra Crest. The mountain is also in the John Muir Wilderness. Along with its neighbor to the south, Basin Mountain, it dominates the western skyline from the upper Owens Valley. History The mountain is named for Thomas Clark, a resident of the pioneer town of Owensville, who is credited with being the first to ascend the peak in the 1860s. Mount Tom and Mount Morgan were part of the Pine Creek mining operation which was important producer of tungsten for much of the 20th century although the scheelite ore deposits are now largely depleted and mines have closed. Climbing The Owens Valley, at the base of Mt. Tom, is a little over 4,000 feet, and the summit of Mt. Tom is 13,658, for almost 10,000 feet of relief. The common routes up Mount Tom are not technically difficult, most are class 2-3, but they are all strenuous and long. Summiting Mount Tom is possible in a single day, but should only be attempted by those in very good physical condition. Horton Creek Canyon is a common out and back hiking route and 14 mile out and back trail with 5,652 feet of elevation gain.

That year was known as the Year Without a Summer, because Mount Tambora had erupted in the Dutch East Indies the previous year, casting enough sulphur into the atmosphere to reduce global temperatures and cause abnormal weather across much of north-east America and northern Europe. This pall of darkness inspired Byron to write his poem. Literary critics were initially content to classify it as a \\"last man\\" poem, telling the apocalyptic story of the last man on earth. More recent critics have focused on the poem's historical context, as well as the anti-biblical nature of the poem, despite its many references to the Bible. The poem was written only months after the end of Byron's marriage to Anne Isabella Milbanke. Historical context A diagram of the estimated ash fallout from the 1815 Mount Tambora eruption. Ash clouds travelled much farther. Byron's poem was written during the Romantic period. During this period, several events occurred which resembled (to some) the biblical signs of the apocalypse. Many authors at the time saw themselves as prophets with a duty to warn others about their impending doom.Introduction, 7 However, at the same time period, many were questioning their faith in a loving God, due to recent fossil discoveries revealing records of the deaths of entire species buried in the earth.Gordon 614 1816, the year in which the poem was written, was called \\"the year without summer\\", as strange weather and an inexplicable darkness caused record-cold temperatures across Europe, especially in Geneva.Paley, 2 Byron claimed to have received his inspiration for the poem, saying he \\"wrote it... at Geneva, when there was a celebrated dark day, on which the fowls went to roost at noon, and the candles were lighted as at midnight\\".Paley, 3 The darkness was (unknown to those of the time) caused by the volcanic ash spewing from the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia (Vail 184). The search for a cause of the strange changes in the light of day only grew as scientists discovered sunspots on the sun so large that they could be seen with the naked eye.Vail, 184 Newspapers such as the London Chronicle reported on the panic: A scientist in Italy even predicted that the sun would go out on 18 July,Vail 183 shortly before Byron's writing of \\"Darkness\\". His \\"prophecy\\" caused riots, suicides, and religious fervour all over Europe.Vail 186 For example: This prediction, and the strange behavior of nature at this time, stood in direct contrast with many of the feelings of the age. William Wordsworth often expresses in his writing a belief in the connection of God and nature which for much of the Romantic Era's poetry is typical. His \\"Tintern Abbey\\", for example, says \\"Nature never did betray / The heart that loved her\\".\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 122‚Äì123 His poetry also carries the idea that nature is a kind thing, living in peaceful co-existence with man. He says in the same poem, referring to nature, that \\"all which we behold / is full of blessings.\\"qtd. in Schroeder 116 In other poems, such as \\"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\", he uses language for flowers and clouds that is commonly used for heavenly hosts of angels.\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 4 Even the more frightening Gothic poems of Coleridge, another famous poet of the time, argue for a kind treatment of nature that is only cruel if treated cruelly, as in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, unlike Byron's sun, which goes out with no human mistreatment mentioned at all.Schroeder, 116 Criticism and analysis In the past, critics classified \\"Darkness\\" as a \\"Last Man\\" poem, following a general theme of the end of the world scenes from the view of the last man on earth. However, recent scholarship has pointed out the poem's lack of any single \\"Last Man\\" character.Schroeder 117 At the conclusion of the poem, however, it is only the consciousness of the speaker ‚Äì who functions as a Last Man figure ‚Äì that remains in a dark and desolate universe. Thus, the narrator functions as a Last Man character. =Biblical imagery= Byron also uses the hellish biblical language of the apocalypse to carry the real possibility of these events to his readers. The whole poem can be seen as a reference to Matthew 24:29: \\"the sun shall be darkened.\\" In line 32 it describes men \\"gnash[ing] their teeth\\" at the sky, a clear biblical parallel of hell.see Matt 24:51 Vipers twine \\"themselves among the multitude, / Hissing.\\"\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 35‚Äì37 Two men left alive of \\"an enormous city\\" gather \\"holy things\\" around an altar, \\"for an unholy usage\\"‚Äîto burn them for light. Seeing themselves in the light of the fire, they die at the horror of seeing each other \\"unknowing who he was upon whose brow Famine had written Fiend.\\"\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 55‚Äì69 In this future, all men are made to look like fiends, emaciated, dying with \\"their bones as tombless as their flesh.\\"\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 45 They also act like fiends, as Byron says: \\"no love was left,\\"\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 41 matching the biblical prophecy that at the end of the world, \\"the love of many shall wax cold.\\"see Matt 24:12 In doing this, Byron is merely magnifying the events already occurring at the time. The riots, the suicides, the fear associated with the strange turn in the weather and the predicted destruction of the sun, had besieged not only people's hope for a long life, but their beliefs about God's creation and about themselves as well. By bringing out this diabolical imagery, Byron is communicating that fear; that \\"Darkness [or nature] had no need / of aid from them‚ÄîShe was the universe.\\"\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 81‚Äì82 Byron's pessimistic views continue, as he mixes Biblical language with the apparent realities of science at the time. As Paley points out, it is not so much significant that Byron uses Biblical passages as that he deviates from them to make a point.Paley, 6 For example, the thousand-year peace mentioned in the book of Revelation as coming after all the horror of the apocalypse does not exist in Byron's \\"Darkness.\\" Instead, \\"War, which for a moment was no more, / Did glut himself again.\\"\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 38‚Äì39 In other words, swords are only beaten temporarily into plowshares, only to become swords of war once again. Also, the fact that the vipers are \\"stingless\\"\\"Darkness,\\" ll. 37 parallels the Biblical image of the peace to follow destruction: \\"And the sucking child shall play in the whole of the asp.\\"Paley 6 In the poem, though, the snake is rendered harmless, but the humans take advantage of this and the vipers are \\"slain for food.\\" Paley continues, saying \\"associations of millennial imagery are consistently invoked to be bitterly frustrated.\\"Paley, 6 ReferencesBibliography *Gordon, George. ‚ÄúDarkness.‚Äù The Norton Anthology of English Literature.

It was released on 8 October 1988, through Music for Nations sublabel, Under One Flag. The album, although mostly black metal, includes some of the first examples of Viking metal. According to the book Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult by Dayal Patterson, Blood Fire Death began a second trilogy, an era Quorthon described as the \\"pre-Christian Swedish Viking Era\\".

The village is located approximately southeast of Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent and northwest of Hastings, on the A265, half a mile west of its junction with the A21. Etchingham railway station is on the Hastings Line to London Charing Cross and Cannon Street.  History  Etchingham was a manor a long time before the Norman conquest of 1066; after this time the manor was taken over by the Normans. In 1166 it was left to the de Achyngham (Etchingham) family, who were well-known landowners of the time. The Etchingham family papers record that William was so pleased with his right-hand man that he gave him the land now known as Etchingham. The moated manor house, long since demolished, stood at the point now occupied by the London to Hastings railway line. Some of the stone from the manor was probably used in the construction of the station buildings. There is one legend that a great bell lay at the bottom of the moat surrounding the church and manor, and that it would never be seen until six yoke of white oxen were brought to drag it up. Centuries have passed by, the moat is long gone and no bell has surfaced. The 14th-century church was originally built within the grounds of the manor; evidence of the moat can still be seen. =Etymology= The name Etchingham is probably derived from Old English, and roughly translates as \\"The homestead or enclosure of family and followers of a man called Ecci\\". In a place name, \\"inga\\" usually refers to 'people of' or 'dwellers at', and 'ham' to a homestead or settlement.The Popular Dictionary of English Place Names A second possible derivation of the name is that it could come from the Anglo- Saxon \\"ecen\\", meaning great and \\"ham\\" (homestead), but the former explanation is the most likely.The Origin of English Place Names, P.H. Reaney = The church = The parish church in snow The 14th-century parish church is dedicated to The Assumption of Blessed Mary and St Nicholas. On its spire is what is probably England's oldest brass weather vane. It also has the second largest series of misericords in the county;Etchingham Parish Church Guide, 1983 (revised 1994), compiled by Ilse M. Baker BA one depicts a fox preaching to geese. A memorial brass to Agnes Oxenbridge and Elizabeth Etchingham is visible on the floor of the side aisle. =Village sign= Etchingham village sign The design of the village sign is based on the de Etchingham family coat of arms. A similar design is used for the parish council logo, the primary school badge and the church weathervane. = Famous residents = Among the famous former residents of Etchingham is the regicide James Temple, who lived at Haremere Hall in the 1620s.Anthony Fletcher, A County Community in Peace and War: Sussex, 1600‚Äì1660 He was a judge at the trial of Charles I and signed the execution warrant. Haremere was later owned by the second Sir John Lade, a notorious gambler and close friend of the Prince Regent. He was a notable whip. His wife, Letty, had been the mistress of a highwayman before becoming a mistress of the Duke of York. She too was a notable horsewoman and whip and was painted by Stubbs. Sir John ran through the family fortune and ended his life as a coachman. Another famous resident, the novelist and critic Anthony Burgess, lived in a semi-detached house called Applegarth on the south side of the A265 road (west of the High Street). His house can be distinguished by the presence of a small statue of a Siamese cat next to the building (he and his first wife Lynne were cat-lovers). The folk musicians Ashley Hutchings and Shirley Collins lived there in the 1970s and formed the Etchingham Steam Band in 1974. Village hall and organisations The village had an old village hall, that closed in 2014 and was subsequently demolished. The new Village Halls are two halls at the new community complex at Parsonage Croft. One is shared between the school and the community and the other serving the community. The shared hall is known as the Ahrens Hall and the smaller hall is the Parker Hall which serves as the meeting place for the Toddlers' Group. Other groups in the village include The Pickle Ball Club, Brownies and a Darby and Joan Club. A Social Club exists that serves as the base for the village branch of the Royal British Legion and the clubhouse for the Etchingham & Fontridge Cricket Club. Philatelic connections cover produced by Etchingham PCC, to mark the 150th anniversary of the Penny Black, signed by Sarah Godwin and Father Butler, the Rector at the time Henry Corbould FSA, the designer of the first postage stamp, the Penny Black, died at Hurst Green, having been taken ill there while travelling back to London from the coast, and was buried in Etchingham parish church. There is a memorial tablet on the wall of the church, which for many years was believed to be the only known likeness of Corbould. In 1990, as part of the 150th anniversary of the postage stamp, the village produced two First Day Covers to mark the Corbould connection, and held the Etchingham Stamp Festival to raise funds for church repairs. The festival was held over the weekend following the issue of the Miniature Sheet in May, in the church and village hall. The design on the cover is based on architectural detail in the church; the pictorial handstamp for the Etchingham Stamp Festival is based on the church weathervane. One cover was issued in January with the full set of the 'double headed' commemorative stamps and another for the miniature sheet issued in May, both covers bearing special handstamps featuring detail from the church weathervane. Both covers were limited editions. Sarah Godwin, the designer of the 1987 Isaac Newton stamps, designed the cover, her family home being in Etchingham. Cricket The newly formed team after their first match Etchingham had an active cricket team in 1939, the Etchingham & Fontridge Cricket Club, but the start of World War II brought play to an abrupt end. After the war the cricket field was not brought back into use. In early 2006, a group of enthusiasts decided to revive the tradition. The new club has in its possession several artefacts, minutes of meetings and games dating back to the 1920s, when the club was known as the \\"Etchingham & Fontridge Cricket Club\\". Keen to maintain a link with the original club, the new club uses the same name. The original club was formed by Mr. W. F. Foster, who later became its President. A pavilion was erected in 1920, and as the number of playing members increased, a 2nd eleven was formed. Records show that Colonel Hornblower was elected chairman in 1934, with Mr. H. H. Howard as Secretary. By 1934 Mr. J. Gorwyn had become Captain of the 1st team. The newly reinstated club uses the previous club name to maintain a link with past tradition. It is pleased that Lionel Dengate, who was secretary to the club in the 1930s agreed to serve as Honorary Club President. The club does not yet have a suitable cricket field in the village, so for the time being all matches have to be away fixtures.

Arrival of General Sir Frederick Stanley Maude After the surrender of the Kut garrison on 29 April 1916, the British Army in Mesopotamia underwent a major overhaul. A new commander, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Stanley Maude, was given the job of restoring Britain's military reputation. General Maude spent the rest of 1916 rebuilding his army. Most of his troops were recruited in India and then sent by sea to Basra. While these troops were being trained, British military engineers built a field railway from the coast up to Basra and beyond. General Maude also obtained a small force of armed river boats and river supply ships. The British launched their new campaign on 13 December 1916. The British had some 50,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops: mostly British India troops of the Indian Expeditionary Force D together with the 13th (Western) Division of the British Army forming the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force. The Indian divisions of the Indian III Corps (also called the Tigris Corps) included British Army units. The Ottoman forces were smaller, perhaps around 25,000 strong under the overall command of General Khalil Pasha. March on Baghdad Indian troops march into Baghdad, 11 March 1917 There were no setbacks for the British on this campaign. General Maude proceeded cautiously, advancing on both sides of the Tigris River. He earned his nickname Systematic Joe. The Ottoman forces contested a fortified place called the Khadairi Bend which the British captured after two weeks of siege work (6 January to 19 January 1917). The British then had to force the Ottoman forces out of a strong defensive line along the Hai River. This took them two more weeks (from 25 January till 4 February). Another Ottoman position, called Dahra Bend, was taken on 16 February. Finally, the British re-captured Kut on 24 February 1917 in the Second Battle of Kut. The local Ottoman commander, Karabekir Bey, did not let his army become trapped in Kut, as General Townshend had been in the First Battle of Kut. The march on Baghdad resumed on 5 March 1917. Three days later, Maude's corps reached the Diyala River on the outskirts of the city. Khalil Pasha chose to defend Baghdad at the confluence of the Diyala and the Tigris, some 35 miles south of Baghdad. The Ottoman troops resisted the initial British assault on 9 March. General Maude then shifted the majority of his army north. He believed that he could outflank the Ottoman positions and strike directly for Baghdad. Khalil Pasha responded by shifting his army out of its defensive positions to mirror the move of the British on the other side of the river. A single regiment was left to hold the original Diyala River defences. The British crushed this regiment with a sudden assault on 10 March 1917. This sudden defeat unnerved Khalil Pasha and he ordered his army to retreat north to Baghdad. The Ottoman authorities ordered the evacuation of Baghdad at 8 p.m. on 10 March, but the situation was rapidly moving beyond Khalil Pasha's control. The British followed close on the heels of the Ottoman troops and captured Baghdad without a fight on 11 March. A week later, General Maude issued the Proclamation of Baghdad, which included the line, \\"Our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators\\".The proclamation of Baghdad, Sir Stanley Maude, Harper's Magazine Some 9,000 Ottoman troops were caught in the confusion and became prisoners of the British. The British were worried that the Ottoman government might try to flood the Tigris plain. As it happened, this fear was unfounded. The Ottoman troops never attempted to flood the area. Consequences The result was a decisive victory for the British and yet another defeat for the Ottoman government. The humiliation for the British due to the loss of Kut had been partially rectified. The Ottoman government was forced to end its military operations in Persia and try to build up a new army to prevent the British from moving on to capture Mosul. The capture of Baghdad, a provincial capital, also meant that the first Ottoman province had fallen under British control. Although good news for the British forces, this caused a great deal of bureaucratic fighting between the British government in London and the British government in India. Once he captured Baghdad, Maude was the de facto Governor of Mesopotamia from Basra to Baghdad. Sir Percy Cox, the Tigris Corps Political Officer, attempted to issue a proclamation stating that the province was under joint British-Indian administration, but London ordered Cox not to issue his proclamation and came out with its own proclamation asking Arab leaders to aid the British administration instead. At the same time, the Indian colonial government had different ideas. After all, they had been the prime movers behind Mesopotamia in the first place. The British government in India wanted this new area placed under its direct control. This power struggle led to the creation of the Mesopotamian Administration Committee, under the leadership of Lord Curzon. Its main task was to determine who would govern the Basra and Baghdad provinces. Its ruling was a British, not Anglo-Indian, administration for Basra and an Arab authority for Baghdad.

Alf was created as one of the show's eighteen original characters. Meagher originally auditioned for the role of Tom Fletcher, before being cast as Alf. He made his first appearance during the pilot episode broadcast on 17 January 1988. As of 2017, Meagher is the sole remaining original cast member and he holds a Guinness World Record for being the longest-serving actor in an Australian serial. For his portrayal of Alf, Meagher won the Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television in 2010. Casting Meagher was cast in the role of Alf after appearing as a supporting character in numerous roles. He was one of only eight older actors that were cast in the serial's original line up. Upon receiving his first regular role Meagher said \\"It's good for me to play someone like that after all the other blokes.\\" During an interview published on the Channel 5 website, Meagher revealed that he did not audition for Alf and the producers originally saw him for the role of Tom Fletcher (eventually played by Roger Oakley). Meagher holds a Guinness World Record as the longest- serving actor in an Australian serial for portraying Alf since 1988. As of 2011 he is the only remaining original cast member still present. During flashbacks to the character's past, Alf was portrayed by Max Buckley and Robert Jago respectively. In April 2010, it was announced Meagher was taking a break from Home and Away, so he could travel to London to star in the West End production of Priscilla Queen of the Desert. Meagher said \\"[Home and Away] have very generously allowed me to do Priscilla in the West End from 20 September roughly until early March.\\" Meagher returned to the West End in October 2011. However, the actor, whose contract was up for renewal in 2012, said he was committed to staying in Home and Away because he still enjoyed the role of Alf. Meagher is the only cast member whose contract entitles him to extra holidays. In February 2013, Meagher told a reporter from the AAP that he had signed a five-year contract with Home and Away. But he is allowed to leave providing he gives six months notice. In September 2018, Meagher reprised his role as Bob in Priscilla Queen of the Desert for six weeks. Meagher revealed that he had been offered the part 18 months prior, but had to turn it down due to his filming commitments with Home and Away. He stated, \\"When I was offered it, it was difficult to fit in with Home and Away, so having said 'thanks, but no thanks' I thought about it and wondered if they would allow me to only do Brisbane.\\" Meagher also revealed that he had just signed another three-year contract with Home and Away. Development In his early years Alf was described as a \\"good-natured rogue with a finger in every pie.\\" Meagher said that although some people think he is miserable, he sees him as an \\"upstanding member of the community\\". He further added \\"He can be a bit grumpy and gets stuck into people and you have to be quick to catch his apology if he is wrong, but on the whole he is a big softie.\\" Alf has shown a keen interest in business. Whilst serving on the Surf Club Committee, he also works as a bartender. He also owns a bait shop and takes part in recreational fishing. Meagher often changes dialogue to suit Alf's speech. Alf's first on-screen relationship is with Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn). Writers decided that they pair would marry early on. When filming began heavy rain disrupted filming for two weeks. Nunn almost missed her own wedding due to the producers trying to get her film. Meagher has stated that Alf's most memorable storyline is when he develops a brain tumour. He had to film the scenes twice, once with his co- star Nunn and the other without. Meagher said that it was an emotional experience. Alf's relationship with sister Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) has often been strained. There has been a lots of fights and antagonism between the pair. Morag later softens towards him after they reach an understanding. Frances said: \\"underneath she will always care for him and look after him.\\" Frances felt it perhaps not the best development because she enjoyed their \\"wonderful fights\\". Alf's life changed when he was reunited with his teenage sweetheart Viv Standish (Maggie Kirkpatrick), who told Alf that she had given birth to their son, Owen, and put him up for adoption. Alf then learned that Owen had died after being attacked by his son Eric \\"Ric\\" Dalby (Mark Furze). Alf attends Owen's funeral and when he sees his grandson, he is tempted to approach him, but he decided to take Morag's advice and wait. Meagher stated, \\"Alf feels a responsibility to this kid, especially since his dad was a ratbag. Alf's also been a bit of a failure in the fatherhood department, so in a way, Eric is a life raft ‚Äì a way for him to make up for the past.\\" StorylinesBackstory= Alf grew up in Summer Bay and took an interest in business. His father Gordon and Scottish grandfather Angus also lived in the Bay. By the time he was thirty, he owned the Summer Bay Liquor Store, the Summer Bay Caravan Park, a boat hire service and a yacht brokerage. Alf married a local woman called Martha Baldivis and they moved into the Summer Bay House at the Caravan Park. They had a daughter called Ruth. In 1985, Martha drowned and Alf decided that he could no longer live there and he let the Caravan Park decline, but looked after the house. He met Ailsa and they began dating, despite Ruth's dislike of her. Alf decides to sell the business and home to the Fletcher family. =1988‚Äì= Alf first appears in the pilot episode of the show, in which he sells the Summer Bay Caravan Park to Tom and Pippa Fletcher, unable to cope with living there following the death of his wife, Martha, three years earlier. By now Alf is involved in a relationship with general store owner Ailsa, who he marries in 1988, despite the disapproval of his daughter Ruth (Roo) and the revelation that Ailsa was convicted of the murder of her abusive father. After briefly separating, Alf and Ailsa reunite in late 1988, unexpectedly becoming parents to Duncan the following year. Alf later discovers he has a daughter, Quinn Jackson, from a previous relationship, but she rejects her father. In 2000, Ailsa reveals she also has another child, conceived after she was raped by a prison guard. This child turns out to be Shauna Bradley, who already lives in Summer Bay. In 2001 Ailsa collapses and dies suddenly as the result of an undiscovered heart condition. Two years later a still distraught Alf has a nervous breakdown and begins seeing visions of his dead wife. It's later discovered he has a brain tumour. In 2004 Alf discovers he has another long-lost child when he is reunited with his terminally ill former girlfriend, Viv Standish. The revelation leads Alf to realise local bad boy Eric Dalby, whom he loathes, is his grandson. After a difficult start the two build a relationship. The following year Alf is reunited with yet another long-lost family member when Roo introduces him to Martha, the daughter she gave up for adoption in 1988. In 2008, Alf is left upset when his best friend Sally Fletcher decides to leave the Bay. Sally and her daughter return to the Bay five years later, and she reveals that her daughter is dying and the only way to save her is to go to America for treatment. Alf helps her raise the money for the treatment. In 2010, Alf and his friends were stalked by Penn Graham, the son of a married woman Alf had an affair with in between his first wife dying and meeting his second wife Alisa. Alf decides to visit the Canberra war memorial with some students when he realises they do not care about ANZAC Day. As he looks around the memorial, he starts to suffer flashbacks to his time in Vietnam. Later that night, the students and Alf sleep outdoors in trenches as part of the war experience. Alf continues to suffer flashbacks and wanders off by himself, before collapsing. He is taken to the hospital and diagnosed with PTSD. He initially refuses to deal with it, but eventually opens up to a therapist. In popular culture\\"Alf's Stewart Rape Dungeon\\" parody= In 2010, a video featuring a parody version of the character was created and posted online by an artist known as \\"Mr Doodleburger\\". The parody showed a dark and sinister parallel universe/alternate version of the character, who would routinely torture people and kept a variety of characters from this parallel version of Home and Away in his \\"rape dungeon\\".Taylor, Andrew \\"Actor Verballed Into a Foul Tirade\\" Sydney Morning Herald 5 September 2012 ‚Äî https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/actor-verballed-into-a-foul- tirade-20120905-25dtv.html>Mike Hohnen \\"Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon Parody to feature at Film Festival\\" Musicfeeds on September 6, 2012 http://musicfeeds.com.au/culture/alf-stewart-rape-dungeon-parody-to-feature- at-film-festival/ This version of Alf Stewart is starkly different to the normal one portrayed in Home and Away, being dark, threatening, and prone to using violent imagery and threats in his stories. The videos featuring the character were created by using original footage from Home and Away, with new voice tracks added in. The parody was successful, with the initial clip receiving 5.4 million views. It also developed a cult following.Thomas, Sarah \\"Critics' Choice\\" The Sydney Morning Herald 7 September 2012 A Facebook page dedicated to the videos was soon set up. News outlets claimed the Facebook page and the videos were pro rape,\\"Press Digest - Australian General News\\" THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW 25 May 2010LOGIE STAR SMEAR MX Sydney 24 May 2010 leading for some to call for the social networking site to be more closely monitored. However, other sections of the media have pointed out that the Facebook page is merely a reference to the parody videos, and not promoting rape at all. =Use of Australian slang= One of the character's most noted traits is his use of Australian slang and bush expressions, including \\"flamin galah\\", \\"stone the flamin' crows\\", and \\"strike me roan\\". In 2014, Stephanie Packer of the Herald Sun reported that the use of slang words, like those favoured by Alf, was decreasing in Australia, and television was the one of the only remaining places to hear them. Reception For his portrayal of Alf, Meagher was nominated for Most Popular Actor at the 2008 Digital Spy Soap Awards. In 2010, Meagher won the Gold Logie at the Logie Awards. He was also nominated for Most Popular Actor. Meagher won the Most Popular Actor Logie Award in 2018. That same year, he won Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. Meagher received a nomination for Most Popular Actor at the 2019 Logie Awards. The episode featuring Alf's breakdown following the suicide of an army mate, Jeff Marshall, who served with him in Vietnam, won the 1998 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Episode in a Television Drama Serial and was presented to director Russell Webb. The episode featuring Alf's late wife Ailsa showing him a vision of Summer Bay without him won the 2003 Australian Writers' Guild Award for Best Episode in a Television Serial. It was presented to the episode's writer Coral Drouyn. Robin Oliver from The Sydney Morning Herald said that Alf and Ailsa formed a \\"terrific partnership\\". Rosemarie Milsome of the Newcastle Herald was critical of Alf's treatment of Chloe Richards breastfeeding her newborn daughter Olivia in the diner, labelling him \\"The stereotypical ocker middle-aged male; judgmental, laconic and a pain in the backside.\\" She added: \\"I thought Chloe should have decked Alf, but then I tend to fly off the handle and, anyway, it would have been difficult for her to have a good swing with a baby attached to her nipple.\\" Holy Soap have said that Alf's most memorable moment is \\"The classic episode ripping off It's A Wonderful Life, in which Alf, in the middle of a brain tumour operation, is led through Summer Bay history as if he had never existed.\\" They also describe him as \\"the Lou Carpenter of Summer Bay, a miserable but lovable legend who will never leave.\\" Hampshire culture website Get Hampshire branded Alf a \\"legendary misery-guts\\". They also said he is commonly known for his use of declining Australian slang with sayings such as \\"flamin' mongrel\\".

Background President Per√≥n was first elected in 1946. In 1949, a constitutional amendment sponsored by Peronism introduced a number of workers' rights and the possibility of presidential reelection. The legitimacy of the new constitution is still controversial. Per√≥n was reelected in 1951. At the time, his administration was widely supported by the labor unions, the military and the Catholic Church. However, economic problems, some of the government's policies, and Per√≥n's own personality cult changed this situation. The opposition criticized Per√≥n because of his treatment of dissidents. (Writers, artists, politicians and other intellectuals were harassed and sometimes were forced into exile.) The government's relationship with the Catholic Church also worsened. As the Church increasingly distanced itself from Per√≥n, the government, which had first respected the Church's privileges, now took them away in a distinctly confrontational fashion. By 1954, the Catholic clergy was openly anti-Peronist, which also influenced some factions of the military. Meanwhile, a Christian Democratic Party was founded in 1954 after several other organisations had been active promoting Christian democracy in Argentina. By 1955, Per√≥n had lost the support of a large part of the military, who conspired with other political actors (members of the Radical Party and the Socialist Party, as well as conservative groups). There was turmoil in different parts of the country. On 14 June, Catholic bishops spoke against Per√≥n during a Corpus Christi procession which turned into an anti-government demonstration.  Military uprising  First coup attempt = On 16 June 1955, 30 Argentine Navy and Air Force aircraft bombed Plaza de Mayo, Buenos Aires' main square, killing over 300 civilians and wounding hundreds more. The attack remains to this day the largest aerial bombing ever executed on the Argentine mainland. The bombing targeted the adjacent Casa Rosada, the official seat of government, as a large crowd was gathered there expressing support for president Juan Per√≥n. The strike took place during a day of official public demonstrations to condemn the burning of a national flag allegedly carried out by detractors of Per√≥n during the recent procession of Corpus Christi. In retaliation, extremist Peronist groups attacked and burned several churches that night, allegedly instigated by Vice-President Alberto Teisaire. The only important political support for Per√≥n came from the General Confederation of Labour (the main confederation of labor unions), which called the workers to defend the president. Per√≥n addressed a workers' demonstration on 31 August. = September rebellion = On 16 September, a new uprising, led by General Eduardo Lonardi, General Pedro E. Aramburu and Admiral Isaac Rojas, deposed Per√≥n and established a provisional government. For several days, there was some fighting in places like the city of C√≥rdoba (Lonardi's central command), the Puerto Belgrano Naval Base near Bah√≠a Blanca, another naval base at R√≠o Santiago, and a mechanized infantry regiment at Curuz√∫ Cuati√°, Corrientes Province. Civilian casualties after the massacre on Plaza de Mayo, 1955 The rebellion in Corrientes, which was initially defeated, was led by Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, who later became one of the main players of the future government. Two rebel destroyers, that were enforcing the blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata, were strafed by loyalist aircraft and suffered some casualties. The city of Mar del Plata was subjected to naval bombardment on 19 September by the light cruiser ARA 9 de Julio and several destroyers, and scattered skirmishes and air strikes took place elsewhere, including Buenos Aires itself. After realizing that the country was on the brink of civil war, Per√≥n resigned and sought asylum in Paraguay, after taking shelter aboard the Paraguayan gunboat Paraguay. On 23 September, Lonardi assumed the presidency and gave a conciliatory speech from the balcony of the Casa Rosada, saying that there would be \\"neither victors nor vanquished\\" (ni vencedores ni vencidos, replaying a phrase uttered by Urquiza when he was victorious over Rosas at the Battle of Caseros). General Lonardi promised that the interim administration would end as soon as the country was \\"reorganized\\". His conciliatory tone earned him the opposition of hard-liners, and in November an internal coup deposed Lonardi and placed General Aramburu in the presidency, giving rise to a wild \\"anti-Peronism\\".  Aftermath  After the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, Per√≥n and his followers were accused of treason, and Eva Per√≥n's remains were moved secretly to Italy and buried in a graveyard at Milan under a fake identity. Public references to Per√≥n or his late wife, including songs, writings and pictures, were forbidden. Even sportsmen like Delfo Cabrera, Mary Ter√°n de Weiss, many of the major basketball players, as well as Olympic-level athlete, Osvaldo Su√°rez, were unfairly punished, by being accused of having gotten their sports success only because they were Per√≥n followers. The Peronist Party suffered a proscription that was to last until Per√≥n's return in 1973, even though Per√≥n influenced the results of the 1958 and 1963 elections from his exile in Madrid.

A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, ensuring a separation between the game flow and the thinking process. Many turn-based MMORPGs are text-based, but there are a few games which depict their environments with fully animated graphics, such as Atlantica Online. Text-based and browser games :For a more complete list, see: List of multiplayer browser games. The article includes notes on whether each game is turn-based. Many multiplayer browser games give the player a set number of turns which are replenished at set increments of time or through in-game items. Early BBS door games were turn-based, and browser games that use server-side scripting (such as PHP, ASP, Ruby, Perl, Python or Java) operate on similar principles. Most of these games use text or a combination of text and still images to depict the game world. Games like Kingdom of Loathing play like traditional turn-based role-playing video games, with players given a new allotment of turns each day.

The aim was to encourage mixing in the emerging New York DJ scene of the early 1980s and elsewhere. The follow-up single, \\"When Boys Talk,\\" did not achieve the same level of success on either side of the Atlantic, which, combined with its limited later success, put the group into the one-hit wonders category.

It begins at exit 20 on the Adirondack Northway (Interstate 87 or I-87) in the Warren County town of Queensbury and intersects U.S. Route 9 (US 9), US 4, and NY 22, among other routes, as it progresses eastward to its eastern end at the Vermont state line in the Washington County village of Granville. Here, the highway becomes Vermont Route 149 (VT 149) and continues for an additional to an intersection with VT 30 in Rutland County. Both NY 149 and VT 149 traverse mostly rural areas. NY 149 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and initially extended from NY 9L in Queensbury to NY 22 south of Granville by way of an east‚Äìwest highway built during the first two decades of the 20th century. It was cut back to US 4 , but extended westward back to NY 9L in the mid-1950s. It was extended further west to US 9 in the late 1950s and to I-87 exit 20 . In the mid-1960s, NY 22 was rerouted to bypass Granville to the west. NY 149 was then extended to Vermont by way of NY 22's former routing into the village and East Main Street. The short continuation of Granville's East Main Street in Vermont, designated as Vermont Route 30B since 1935, was renumbered to VT 149 in December 1966 to match the New York number. Route descriptionQueensbury and Fort Ann= NY 149 officially begins at exit 20 on the northbound Adirondack Northway (I-87) in the town of Queensbury, from where it follows a ramp eastward to US 9. As signed, however, NY 149 begins at the southbound portion of I-87 exit 20 and follows County Route 23 (CR 23, named Gurney Lane) east to US 9, where it turns to follow US 9 northward. The signed and official routings join at the exit's northbound ramps. While concurrent with US 9, NY 149 passes the Adirondack/Lake George Factory Outlet Mall and several other businesses located on both sides of the highway. At the end of the factory outlets in the hamlet of French Mountain, NY 149 turns off US 9 and proceeds in a generally eastward direction toward the village of Fort Ann. NY 149's signed western terminus along Gurney Lane (CR 23) in Queensbury. NY 149 officially ends further north in Queensbury After passing under a bike path overpass and a recreational vehicle park, the route runs through an area of rural residential dwellings and wooded areas situated north of Glen Lake. At the northern tip of the lake, NY 149 intersects Oxbow Hill Road, a connector to CR 63 (Moon Hill Road) that is maintained by Warren County despite not being a numbered Warren County route. East of this junction, the highway turns to the northeast and crosses the Blue Line into Adirondack Park ahead of an intersection with CR 7 (Bay Road). NY 149 continues on, curving back to the east as it passes the Queensbury Country Club and meets NY 9L. The route enters Washington County and the town of Fort Ann roughly later. The first several miles of NY 149 in Washington County pass through isolated, rural areas as it curves to the north and south while following a generally east‚Äìwest alignment. In West Fort Ann, the only community along the route between the county line and the village of Fort Ann, NY 149 intersects with Old State Route 149, a loop route of NY 149 that was created when the highway was realigned. The route continues east from the community, exiting Adirondack Park and crossing over Halfway Creek on its way into the village of Fort Ann, where it becomes Ann Street. Within the village, NY 149 passes the Fort Ann Cemetery and two blocks of homes before intersecting with US 4 at George Street. NY 149 turns to the south, joining US 4 along George Street through downtown Fort Ann. After passing the town park, US 4 and NY 149 leave the village and become nameless as they head south into the town of Kingsbury. =East of Fort Ann= NY 149 crossing the Mettawee River in Granville. This bridge replaced an older span in 2006 In Kingsbury, US 4 and NY 149 head through an open area dotted with farms and ponds. The routes proceed southward to a junction known as Baldwin Corner, where US 4 and NY 149 split. While US 4 heads to the southeast, NY 149 continues due south, paralleling the Champlain Canal to an area known as Smith's Basin. Here, NY 149 turns east and crosses both a railroad line and the canal‚Äîwhich NY 149 had been following since joining US 4 in downtown Fort Ann‚Äîto enter the town of Hartford. Here, the route winds its way eastward through a rural, mostly undeveloped area of Washington County as it intersects several county roads on its way to the hamlet of Hartford. In Hartford, NY 149 intersects both Christian Hill Road and CR 23 (the main street of the community) ahead of a junction with NY 40 south of the community. The two routes converge here as NY 149 follows NY 40 northward around the small community to a junction east of the hamlet's center, where NY 149 turns off to the east and begins to pass through more rural areas of the town of Hartford and the adjacent town of Granville. Upon crossing into Granville, the open areas along the route give way to dense forests. NY 149 continues generally northeastward through the town, passing through the isolated hamlet of Hillsdale before curving to the southeast toward South Granville. At the center of the community, NY 149 turns to the northeast at an intersection with CR 27 and CR 28. NY 149 at the Vermont state line, marking the transition to VT 149 The route leaves South Granville, passing patches of trees and a smattering of homes as it heads toward the border village of Granville. Just south of the village limits, NY 149 intersects with NY 22\\\\. NY 22 and NY 149 briefly overlap before NY 22 forks off to bypass Granville to the west. NY 149 continues into Granville, becoming Quaker Street upon entering the village limits. The route proceeds through the village to its center, where NY 149 forks northeastward onto West Main Street and crosses over the Mettawee River. At an intersection with Church Street (CR 26), NY 149 becomes East Main Street and turns to the southeast on its way to the Vermont state line, where the roadway becomes VT 149. VT 149 heads southeastward away from the built up village of Granville into a more rural region of the Rutland County town of Pawlet, paralleling the Mettawee River as it progresses onward. It heads past homes and through a dense forest as it intersects with Bull Frog Hollow Road just after the border. After Bull Frog Hollow Road, the route proceeds eastward through an area dominated by quarries. VT 149 continues on, entering a more open area and passing only a few homes before ending at an intersection with VT 30 in Blossom Corners, a small, largely unpopulated community within the town of Pawlet. HistoryState takeover and improvements= Signage along the NY 22 / NY 149 concurrency in Granville Several portions of NY 149 were constructed during the early 20th century when the state of New York assumed ownership over thousands of highways across the state. The earliest known constructed portion of modern NY 149 is the segment between the southern end of the NY 22 overlap and the southern village limits of Granville. The state let a $10,850 (equivalent to $ in ) contract to improve the highway, legislatively designated as part of State Highway 104 (SH 104), on May 12, 1902. The highway was added to the state highway system on October 6, 1902, following the completion of the project. The portion of NY 149 that overlaps US 9 in Queensbury, designated as part of SH 417, was improved under the terms of a $82,700 (equivalent to $ in ) contract awarded on July 10, 1906. It was added to the state highway system on January 10, 1907. Other portions of modern NY 149 were constructed over the course of the next decade. In 1911, work began on the section of current NY 149 between Smith's Basin and the northern junction with NY 40 in Hartford. The contract for the portion in the town of Fort Ann (SH 942) was let on June 15 while the contract for the section in Hartford (SH 802) was awarded three months earlier on March 30\\\\. The two projects were carried out simultaneously over the next two years. SH 802 was added to the state highway system on February 9, 1914, while SH 942 was included in the system on May 5, 1914. In all, the improvement of the two state highways cost $69,577.20 (equivalent to $ in ). In 1913, construction began on the portion of what is now NY 149 in Granville south of North Street, internally designated as SH 5404\\\\. The $77,684.89 (equivalent to $ in ) contract was awarded on September 5, 1913. The necessary improvements were made over the course of the next year and the highway was incorporated into the state highway system on October 29, 1914. The last portion of NY 149 with a known construction date is the section concurrent to US 4 in Fort Ann (part of SH 1224). A contract for its improvement was let on January 8, 1915 at a cost of $43,778.92 (equivalent to $ in ). The improvements were made over the next year and the roadway was added to the state highway system on January 10, 1916. NY 149 and US 9 signage through Queensbury When the first set of New York state routes were assigned in 1924, SH 417 became part of NY 6 while SH 104 and SH 5404 were included in NY 24 and SH 1224 was designated as part of NY 30. NY 6 was replaced by US 9 while NY 30 was co-designated as US 4 between Glens Falls and Whitehall in 1927 following the creation of the U.S. Highway System in late 1926. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. The remainder of modern NY 149 was unnumbered prior to 1930. =Assignment and alignment changes= In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the NY 30 designation was reassigned elsewhere, leaving just US 4 on the portion of highway that US 4 now shares with NY 149\\\\. At the same time, all of NY 24 south of Middle Granville became part of NY 22 while NY 149 was assigned to the portion of its modern alignment between NY 9L in Queensbury and NY 22 south of the village of Granville. In July 1935, several floods devastated many highways in the state of New York. One highway affected was NY 149, as a bridge carrying the highway in the hamlet of South Granville was washed out. With the bridge out, drivers were detoured onto a town highway (now maintained by Washington County as CR 27) to access NY 22 and Granville from South Granville and to access NY 40 from Granville. NY 22 was also affected by the flood as a bridge in the town of Cambridge was washed out as well. NY 149 was truncated eastward to the southern terminus of its overlap with US 4 south of Fort Ann. The change lasted for roughly 15 years before the highway was reextended westward to NY 9L in the mid-1950s. It was extended again in the late 1950s to follow a pre-existing, unnumbered roadway west to US 9 in the Queensbury hamlet of French Mountain. NY 149 was altered once more to meet the new I-87 at exit 20, resulting in a short overlap with US 9. Map of the overlap between NY 149 and US 9 and NY 149's western terminus In Granville, NY 22 was originally routed on Quaker, Main, and North streets. It was rerouted in the mid-1960s to bypass Granville on a new highway west of the village. NY 149 was then extended northward along NY 22's former routing to the junction of Main and North streets in Granville. From there, it continued eastward on Main Street to reach the Vermont state line, where it connected to VT 30B, a spur route of VT 30 that had been in place since 1935. Vermont renumbered VT 30B to VT 149 in December 1966 to match the highway it now connected to in New York. =Other developments= On July 2, 2005, the Hadlock Pond Dam north of West Fort Ann failed, washing out four sections of NY 149 near that community. As a result, the portion of the route between NY 9L in Queensbury and US 4 in Fort Ann was closed to all traffic. After one week, the highway was reopened, but only for local traffic and construction crews. It was reopened to all traffic on July 24\\\\. The impromptu repair project cost the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). Signage for Champlain Canal Lock 9 along NY 149 in Smith's Basin In 2007, the Times Union of Albany received letters from readers requesting that all of NY 149 be widened from two to four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state would also have to take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area. On July 10, 2008, a tanker truck full of water crashed into a tree along a portion of NY 149 between Bay Road (CR 7) and Ridge Road (NY 9L) that features a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where the driver of the tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY 149. NY 149 between Martindale Road in the town of Queensbury and the Washington County line was upgraded by New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in the late 2000s. Construction began on February 9, 2009 to upgrade the long segment. The project consisted of repaving the roadway in areas, but also included widening the shoulder to wide, reconstructing and straightening NY 149 near Martindale Road along with a spot near the Queensbury Country Club. Culverts would be replaced, drainage systems would be upgraded and they would create a new wetland mitigation area aside of NY 149\\\\. Finally, left turn lanes would be constructed at NY 9L and CR 7 (Bay Road). Announced alongside of a project to reconstruct NY 372, the project would cost $8 million (2009 USD) and given to Kubricky Construction Corporation, based in Queensbury, with a slated completion date of June 2010. However, by July 2010, construction had not been completed, as they just had shut down NY 149 between NY 9L and CR 7. On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT announced a project to reconstruct NY 149 and its junction with US 4 in Fort Ann. The project would upgrade the intersection by doing an overall expansion, requiring the condemnation of one property. This new widening would help make turns from US 4 south to NY 149 west. The intersection would be repaved and drainage basins on US 4 and NY 149, which would tie into the system on Clay Hill Road. NYSDOT's website notes that announced that bids of the new project were announced in Fall 2013 with construction beginning soon after. The slated date of completion for the $1.3 million project would be in Fall 2014.

According to one website advocating Lordship Salvation, \\"the doctrine of Lordship salvation teaches that submitting to Christ as Lord goes hand-in-hand with trusting in Christ as Savior. Lordship salvation is the opposite of what is sometimes called easy-believism or the teaching that salvation comes through an acknowledgement of a certain set of facts.\\" Another website critical of it, defines it similarly, however: \\"As defined by its own advocates, Lordship Salvation could more properly be called \\"Commitment Salvation,\\" \\"Surrender Salvation,\\" \\"Slaveship Salvation,\\" \\"Servantship Salvation,\\" or \\"Submission Salvation\\" since in actuality the debate is not over the Lordship of Christ, but the response of a person to the gospel and the conditions which must be met for salvation.\\" Background \\"By grace alone\\" and \\"through faith alone\\" are two of the five solae of the Protestant Reformation. Many Protestants affirm these phrases as distinctively Protestant, whereas the Lordship Salvation controversy concerns what grace and faith must include, and what they must exclude, for a person to \\"have salvation\\" in the evangelical Protestant sense. The language of what must be included permeates the whole debate and is often transferred from the meaning of the concepts to the status of someone's experience; thus, \\"As a part of his saving work, God will produce repentance, faith, sanctification, yieldedness, obedience, and ultimately glorification. Since he is not dependent on human effort in producing these elements, an experience that lacks any of them cannot be the saving work of God.\\" Related to the issue of what must be included or not, the debate also looks at conversion using language which refers to concepts on \\"accepting Christ as ....\\" This is how the term Lordship became associated with the debate, by discussions of various ways to accept Christ; sometimes \\"accepting Christ as Savior\\" or \\"accepting Christ as Lord\\" were distinguished, and a debate ensued. This is reflected in various modern translations, taking a cue from Colossians 2:6 in the Good News Bible, which has \\"accept\\" for what is to be done about Christ. In the New International Version of the same verse, the word \\"receive\\" is used. Thus, a common question was \\"do (or did) you accept (or receive) Christ as Lord?\\" The controversy became defined by the question of whether or not this part is included. Given the accepting-as phraseology of the popular GNB of Colossians 2:6, and the receiving-as phraseology in the widely popular NIV of Colossians 2:6, an exegesis based on the NIV, for example, offered an explanation of what manner of receiving this was. John F. MacArthur Jr, in turn, taught that such a receiving was both non-passive toward Christ and actively submissive to Christ, offering this as a way of understanding the English idiom, of what receiving a person \\"as\\" Lord, really means. Yet the \\"as Lord\\" language was not the only metaphor of the controversy. In 1959, Eternity Magazine featured a twin set of articles.. which ignited the debate. and the use of the idiom from the titles: what Christ must \\"be.\\" This asked what Christ must \\"be\\" to the one accepting Christ: must he \\"be Lord\\" in order to \\"be Savior,\\" both, etc. Ten years later (1969), Charles Ryrie used this idiom in a chapter title, verbatim,. quoting exactly the title of the articles in Eternity Magazine, September, 1959. This idiom, what Christ must \\"be\\", was used to derive and discuss the implications for salvation associated with what Christ is. One author, Arthur W. Pink (1886‚Äì1952), had already associated Christ's Lordship with surrendering to it as a sine qua non at the initial point.. Therefore, the controversy dates back to before 1959, to at least before 1953 in the case of Pink, and shows the subject's connection to evangelism. Baptist theologian John Gill in his 18th-century work in exposition of Colossians 2:6 deals with an emphasis on Lordship. In 1988, John F. MacArthur Jr published the first edition of \\"The Gospel According to Jesus\\".. By defining salvation by what it produces and what salvation will not fail to produce, (not only glorification, but good works, repentance, faith, sanctification, yieldedness, and obedience) the book not only heavily spread the extent of the debate, but the debate expanded in scope, from questions about conversion issues, to questions about what is also necessary, and who it is who does what, throughout the Christian life. Using surrender language in the gospel became another issue. Free Grace theology became an umbrella term for a variety of opposing or contrasting positions, sometimes arguing that Lordship salvation was legalistic, sometimes more opposed to it than that, for example, faulting it for not being specific about what degree, quality, and current visibility there must be to the necessary obedience.. The controversy continues to be debated not only in discussions about all the gospels, but also in discussions about almost any of the Pauline epistles and the relationship of Paul the Apostle and Judaism, and the rest of the New Testament, as well as much material about salvation in topical studies, and in systematic theology. History of the debateBackground= Figures of the Reformed tradition and their historical dispute with Arminian Protestants over a person's participatory role in salvation, a debate which many Calvinists identify with the original sin issue Augustine wrote of in his polemics against the British monk Pelagius, gave Reformed scholars and church leaders an intellectual tradition from which to oppose what they considered a false gospel.. An early discussion about the initial conversion aspect of the Lordship salvation issue was in the 1948 systematic theology of Lewis Sperry Chafer, using (and criticizing) the phrase \\"believe and surrender to God\\".. AW Pink (d. 1952), also used this language, but anticipated (and advocated) key terms in the later debate, speaking of both 'surrender' and 'Lordship'. Connection of the word \\"Lordship\\" and salvation existed in a Ph.D dissertation at Wheaton College in 1958.. Therefore, the use of the term 'Lordship salvation' came before the first edition of MacArthur's 1988 book,. possibly after the 1959 debate in Eternity magazine, Sep 1959, between Presbyterian Everett F. Harrison, a professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, and John Stott, an Anglican theologian. =Modern dispute= The controversy moved to the forefront of the evangelical world in the late 1980s when John F. MacArthur argued that the one-third of all Americans who claimed to be born again according to a 1980 Gallup poll reflected millions who are deceived, possessing a false, soul-destroying assurance. There was much published response, particularly from seminary faculty. For example, an early review of the 1988 edition of The Gospel According to Jesus appeared in a Jan‚ÄìMar 1989 Bibliotheca Sacra article by Darrell L Bock. Also in 1989, Charles Ryrie published So Great Salvation and Zane C. Hodges published Absolutely Free! A Biblical Reply to Lordship Salvation. The two 1989 book publications confined the direct debate largely to their authors' footnotes, but the Bock article, in addition to specifically giving points of disagreement and agreement with MacArthur's book, added definitional discussion of terms such as \\"disciple\\" and \\"Lordship,\\" and introduced the consideration of rhetorical devices such as overstatement, into the discussion. However, the debate was on. Since both MacArthur's and Hodges' books were published by Zondervan, some bookstores displayed them together under the banner, \\"Which One is Right?\\". Yet very soon on their heels, in 1992 before the revised edition of MacArthur's work, an anthology of responses from various faculty of reformed seminaries appeared on the subject. and include criticisms of both MacArthur and Hodges, especially in Michael Horton's contribution, \\"Don't Judge a Book by its Cover.\\" MacArthur later published Faith Works (1993) and Hodges published the second edition of his earlier title, The Gospel Under Siege, in 1992. Two ministries, The Grace Evangelical Society, founded in 1986, and the Free Grace Alliance, founded in 2004, arose with the purpose of advancing free grace soteriological views which opposed some concepts introduced by proponents of Lordship salvation. Each group contributed numerous books, journal articles and pamphlets detailing the problems of Lordship salvation or its alternatives. \\"Free Grace\\" became the popular term for the opposing camp in the Lordship salvation debate, and for the ideas against Lordship salvation by authors such as Charles Ryrie, Chuck Swindoll, Charles Stanley, Norman Geisler, and Bill Bright. While free grace was traditionally largely affirmed in Protestantism, and the \\"Free Grace view\\" affirms good works are a proper response to salvation, the Free Grace view argues they should not be taken as the only or sine qua non evidence of one's salvation or righteous standing before God. Proponents of Lordship salvation, on the other hand, criticize opponents as advocating an acquiescence in sin by allowing greatly sinful behavior to exist together with the same assurance of salvation as someone who does not currently allow greatly sinful behavior, but is to some degree subduing sin.

The discharge is one of the primary benefits afforded by relief under the Bankruptcy Code and is essential to the \\"fresh start\\" of debtors following bankruptcy that is a central principle under federal bankruptcy law. Discharge is also believed to play an important role in credit markets by encouraging lenders, who may be more sophisticated and have better information than debtors, to monitor debtors and limit risk-taking.Michael Simkovic, Risk-Based Student Loans (2012) A discharge of debts is granted to debtors but can be denied or revoked by the court based on certain misconduct of debtors, including fraudulent actions or failure of a debtor to disclose all assets during a bankruptcy case. Some debts, such as alimony and childsupport, cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, while others, such as student loans, are difficult to discharge and are therefore rarely discharged. The benefit of the discharge injunction is narrower than (but similar to) the benefit afforded by the automatic stay in bankruptcy. U.S. law also provides for specialized discharges in bankruptcy (see below). Bankruptcy discharge for the debtor In the United States, there are generally seven kinds of debtor discharges in bankruptcy, found in the following statutes: :: (relating to liquidation bankruptcies for individuals); :: (relating to municipal bankruptcies); :: (relating to discharges resulting from confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization); :: (relating to certain family farmer or fisherman cases); :: (relating to certain family farmer or fisherman cases); :: (relating to certain cases involving adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income); :: (relating to certain cases involving adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income).

Pads mostly containing numbers and used with computers are numeric keypads. Keypads are found on devices which require mainly numeric input such as calculators, television remotes, push-button telephones, vending machines, ATMs, Point of Sale devices, combination locks, and digital door locks. Many devices follow the E.161 standard for their arrangement.  Uses and functions  A calculator A computer keyboard usually has a small numeric keypad on the side, in addition to the other number keys on the top, but with a calculator-style arrangement of buttons that allow more efficient entry of numerical data. This number pad (commonly abbreviated to numpad) is usually positioned on the right side of the keyboard because most people are right-handed. Many laptop computers have special function keys that turn part of the alphabetical keyboard into a numerical keypad as there is insufficient space to allow a separate keypad to be built into the laptop's chassis. Separate external plug-in keypads can be purchased. Keypads for the entry of PINs and for product selection appear on many devices including ATMs, vending machines, Point of Sale payment devices, time clocks, combination locks and digital door locks.  Key layout  The first key-activated mechanical calculators and many cash registers used \\"parallel\\" keys with one column of 0 to 9 for each position the machine could use. A smaller, 10-key input first started on the Standard Adding Machine in 1901. The calculator had the digit keys arranged in one row, with zero on the left, and 9 on the right. The modern four-row arrangement debuted with the Sundstrand Adding Machine in 1911. There is no standard for the layout of the four arithmetic operations, the decimal point, equal sign or other more advanced mathematical functions on the keypad of a calculator. The invention of the push-button telephone keypad is attributed to John E. Karlin, an industrial psychologist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ. On a telephone keypad, the numbers 1 through 9 are arranged from left to right, top to bottom with 0 in a row below 789 and in the center. Telephone keypads also have the special buttons labelled * (star) and # (octothorpe, number sign, \\"pound\\", \\"hex\\" or \\"hash\\") on either side of the zero key. The keys on a telephone may also bear letters which have had several auxiliary uses, such as remembering area codes or whole telephone numbers.  Origin of the order difference  Although calculator keypads pre-date telephone keypads by nearly thirty years, the top-to-bottom order for telephones was the result of research studies conducted by a Bell Labs Human Factors group led by John Karlin. They tested a variety of layouts including a Facit like the two-row arrangement, buttons in a circle, buttons in an arc, and rows of three buttons. The definitive study was published in 1960: \\"Human Factor Engineering Studies of the Design and Use of Pushbutton Telephone Sets\\" by R. L. Deininger. This study concluded that the adopted layout was best. Despite the conclusions obtained in the study, there are several popular theories and folk histories explaining the inverse order of telephone and calculator keypads. * One popular theory suggests that the reason is similar to that given for the QWERTY layout, the unfamiliar ordering slowed users to accommodate the slow switches of the late 1950s and early 1960s. * Another explanation proposed is that at the time of the introduction of the telephone keypad, telephone numbers in the U.S. where commonly given out using alphabetical characters for the first two digits. Thus 555-1234 would be given out as KL5-1234. These alpha sequences were mapped to words. \\"27\\" was given out as \\"CRestview\\", \\"26\\" as \\"ATwood\\", etc. By placing the \\"1\\" key in the upper left, the alphabet was arranged in the normal left-to-right descending order for English characters. Additionally, on a rotary telephone, the \\"1\\" hole was at the top, albeit at the top right.

Brega stood at and well over at his heaviest but after the 1960s slimmed down significantly. Biography Brega was born in Rome. He was a butcher before he drifted into acting, where his heavy physique ensured him a plethora of character roles. Debuting with director Dino Risi, he then played some minor roles in Sergio Leone's spaghetti western movies: A Fistful of Dollars, as Chico; For a Few Dollars More, as Ni√±o; The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as Corporal Wallace; and also as a gangster in Once Upon a Time in America. He appeared in many other spaghetti Westerns, including Death Rides a Horse, The Great Silence, and My Name is Nobody. He was also featured in many Federico Fellini films, and later in his career had comical roles with director Carlo Verdone, such as in Un sacco bello and Talcum Powder. He died of heart attack in Rome in 1994.

History Formed in 1995, Club 8 were signed to the Spanish record label Siesta. They released a single called \\"Me Too\\" and an album called Nouvelle with an twee pop sound. In 1998, their second album, The Friend I Once Had, and the single \\"Missing You\\" were released. \\"Missing You\\" became a club and radio hit in Spain and somewhat of a college radio favorite in the US. The band started playing live. Their first gig was in New York at a March Records CMJ event in 1999. Their sound had by now developed into a more bossa nova and dance- oriented one. In 2001, Club 8's sound moved toward chill-out and trip hop on their third, self-titled album. In the autumn of 2001, the duo used Stockholm's Summersound Studios, writing songs and experimenting with dub, trip hop, chillout, 1980s, and bossa nova sounds. The resulting album, released in 2002, is named Spring Came, Rain Fell. The 2003 follow-up album, Strangely Beautiful, peaked at number 18 on the CMJ charts in the US. For the first time since 1999, the band released a single from the album and a corresponding video. Backed by five exclusive tracks, the song \\"Saturday Night Engine\\" was released as a single in the spring of 2003. The video made it to number 16 on the Up North chart on MTV Nordic. Afterward, Angerg√•rd formed a band called The Legends, which recorded three albums between 2004 and 2006. He also made an Acid House Kings album in 2005. In 2007, Club 8 released their sixth album, The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming, on Labrador Records. Club 8's album The People's Record, was released on 18 May 2010, and was produced by Jari Haapalainen. Their next album, titled Above the City, came out on 21 May 2013. Club 8 has since released two further studio albums: 2015's Pleasure, and their latest, Golden Island, which came out in 2018.

In a phased array or slotted waveguide antenna, squint refers to the angle that the transmission is offset from the normal of the plane of the antenna. In simple terms, it is the change in the beam direction as a function of operating frequency, polarization, or orientation. It is an important phenomenon that can limit the bandwidth in phased array antenna systems.Seyed Kasra Garakoui, Eric A.M. Klumperink, Bram Nauta, Frank E. van Vliet, \\"Phased-Array Antenna Beam Squinting Related to Frequency Dependency of Delay Circuits\\" This deflection can be caused by: ;Signal Frequency :Signals in a waveguide travel at a speed that varies with frequency and the dimensions of the waveguide. In a phased array or slotted waveguide antenna, the signal is designed to reach the outputs in a given phase relationship. This can be accomplished for any single frequency by properly adjusting the length of each waveguide so the signals arrive in-phase. However, if a different frequency is sent into the feeds, they will arrive at the ends at different times, the phase relationship will not be maintained, and squint will result. Frequency-dependant phase shifting of the elements of the array can be used to compensate for the squint, which leads to the concept of a squintless antenna or feed. ;Design :In some cases the antenna may be designed to create a squint. For example, an antenna which is used to communicate with a satellite but must remain in a vertical configuration. Squint is also required in conical scanning.

There are many instruments used in scientific and industrial applications that use dials with pointers as indicators of a specific physical property. Typical examples include pressure and vacuum gauges, fluid-level gauges (for fuel, engine oil, and so on), voltmeters and ammeters, thermometers and hygrometers, speedometers and tachometers, and indicators (distance amplifying instruments). Traditionally these have been mechanical devices, but with the advent of electronic displays, analog dials are often simulated from digital measurements. The term may also refer to a movable control knob used to change the settings of the controlled instrument, for example, to change the frequency of the radio, or the desired temperature on a thermostat. Styles of dials: * Circular, * Fixed pointer with moving scale, * Fixed scale with moving dial. Examples of dial usage: * Pressure and vacuum gauges, * Level gauges, * Volt and current meters, * Thermometers and thermostats (mechanical), * Speedometers and tachometers. Mirror dials are designed to reduce or eliminate the effect of parallax. They usually consist of a small mirrored strip running parallel to the graduations of the scale under the pointer. When the observer moves his position so that the pointer obscures the pointer's reflection in the mirror, an accurate reading may be taken.

The left knob controls the temperature while the right controls the fan speed. A control knob is a rotary control used to provide input to a device when grasped by an operator and turned, so that the degree of rotation corresponds to the desired input. Such knobs are one of the most common components in control systems and are found on all sorts of devices.https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16412811 Operation A control knob works by turning a shaft which connects to the component which produces the actual input. Common control components used include potentiometers, variable capacitors, and rotary switches. An example where the knob does not produce a variation in an electrical signal may be found in many toasters, where the darkness knob moves the thermostat in such a way as to change the temperature at which it opens and releases the cooked toast. Some similar controls produce similar inputs using different geometry; for example, the knob may be replaced by a lever which is moved through an angle. Another example is the sliding controls which frequently replace knobs as level controls in audio equipment. Feedback The use of knobs is an important aspect of the design of user interfaces in these devices. Particular attention needs to be paid to the feedback to the operator from the adjustments being made. The use of a pointer on the knob in conjunction with a scale assists in producing repeatable settings; in other cases there may be a dial or other indicator which is either mechanically linked the knob's rotation (as in many older radio tuners) or which reports the behavior being controlled.

BiographyEarly life= He was born in »òtefƒÉne»ôti, a village of Boto»ôani County, as the son of Major Dumitru Luchian and of Elena Chiriacescu. The Luchian family moved to Bucharest in 1873 and his mother desired that he would follow his father's path and join the Military School. Instead, in 1885, Luchian joined the painting class at the Fine Arts School, where he was encouraged to pursue a career in art by Nicolae Grigorescu, whose work was to have a major effect on his entire creative life.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.174 Starting in autumn of 1889 Luchian studied for two semesters at the Munich Fine Arts Academy, where he created copies of the works by Correggio and Rembrandt housed in the Kunstareal. After his return to Romania, he took part in the first exhibition of the Cercul Artistic art group. He showed himself unable to accept the academic guidelines imposed by the Bavarian and Romanian schools.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.173 The following year, he left for Paris, where he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian, and, although taught by the academic artist William-Adolphe Bouguereau, became acquainted with impressionist works of art.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.173-174, 179 Luchian's painting Ultima cursƒÉ de toamnƒÉ shows the influence of √âdouard Manet and Edgar Degas, but also echoes of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, Modernism, and Post-impressionism (also obvious in works created after his return to Bucharest).DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.168, 174, 179 =Chronic illness and death= In 1896, together with Nicolae Vermont, Constantin Artachino, and the art collector, Alexandru Bogdan- Pite»ôti, Stefan Luchian was one of the main founders of Bucharest's Salonul Independen≈£ilor, which was opened in front of the official Salon (the Romanian equivalent of the Paris Salon).DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.167-168; Ionescu Two years later, the group led to the creation of Societatea Ileana and its press organ, Ileana,DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.168; Ionescu with Luchian as the original illustrator.Ionescu From then on Luchian began integrating Symbolist elements in his work, taking inspiration from various related trends: Art Nouveau, Jugendstil and Mir iskusstva (see Symbolist movement in Romania).DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.168 In 1900, Luchian contributed two pastels to Romania's Pavilion at the World Fair, and in the same year suffered the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis, the disease which, after some initial improvements, was to haunt him for the rest of his life. Nonetheless, he continued painting and, until 1915, had his works displayed in numerous exhibitions, albeit to a largely indifferent public.Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.620-621 At his 1905 exhibition, the only buyer of a painting was his former teacher Grigorescu. Despite being appreciated by a select few (including the writer Ion Luca Caragiale),Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.621 Luchian lived in poverty (the large fortune he had inherited was progressively drained).Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.622-623 Interior (Lorica), Luchian's last painting (1913) Paralysed from 1909, he had to live the rest of his life in an armchair.Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.617 This did not prevent him from working on an entire series of landscapes and flowers. He had begun flower paintings earlier, but from 1908 he concentrated all his creative energy into the subject. Toward the end of his life, Luchian was no longer able to hold the painter's brush with his fingers, and was instead helped to tie it to his wrist in order to continue work.Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.618-621; DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.175 At the time, he had begun enjoying considerable success -- a phenomenon which the writer Tudor Arghezi attributed to the momentary rise of Take Ionescu as a politician (Ionescu had become the center of a fashion and subject of imitation, and he was among the first to buy more than one of Luchian's paintings).Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.617-618 As his disease became notorious, a rumor spread that Luchian allowed someone else to paint in his name; the scandal brought about Luchian's arrest under charges of fraud (he was released soon after).Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.617, 620-621 Arghezi took pride in being one of his few defenders. One of the last events in Luchian's life was a visit paid to his house by composer and violinist George Enescu. Although the two had never met before, Enescu played his instrument as a personal tribute to the dying artist.Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.623 He died in Bucharest and he was buried at the Bellu Cemetery. Legacy By the 1930s, Luchian's impact on Romanian art was becoming the subject of disputes in the cultural world, with several critics claiming that his work had been minor and the details of his life exaggerated.Arghezi, Din zilele lui Luchian, in Scrieri, p.616-617 Arghezi was again involved in the polemic, and wrote passionate pieces which supported Luchian's art and attributed adverse reactions to jealousy and to Luchian's voiced distaste for mediocrity. In 1948, Luchian was posthumously elected to the Romanian Academy. An art school in Boto»ôani bears his name. His life was the subject of Nicolae MƒÉrgineanu's 1981 film, Luchian, where his character was played by Ion Caramitru (Maria Ploae was Luchian's sister; other actors starring in the film where George Constantin, »òtefan Velniciuc, Florin CƒÉlinescu as Arghezi, and Adrian Pintea as Nicolae Tonitza).

His Anacreon (1791) obtained him a post in the royal library in 1795. He also published several paraphrases of Greek classics. These were followed in 1799 by an edition of the Arabic text of Muhammad al-Idrisi's Description of Spain, with notes and a translation. As an afrancesado, he fled Spain in 1813, but returned a year later and was eventually reinstated to his honors. His magnum opus, the three-volume Historia de la Dominaci√≥n de los √Årabes en Espa√±a, was published after his death. Career Conde was educated at the university of Alcal√°. He published a translation of the works of the Greek poet Anacreon in 1795. In 1796-1797, he published paraphrases from Theocritus, Bion, Moschus, Sappho and Meleager. In 1799, these were followed by an edition of the Arabic text of Muhammad al- Idrisi's Description of Spain, with notes and a translation, making him among the first modern western historians to translate an important Arabic text. Conde became a member of the Spanish Academy in 1802. He succeeded Tom√°s Antonio S√°nchez de Uribe to the so-called \\"G\\" seat. Conde was a member also of Academy of Sciences and Letters of Berlin. In 1804, Conde was accepted to membership of the Royal Academy of History, but his appointment as interpreter to Joseph Bonaparte and his being an afrancesado (French sympathizer) led to his expulsion from both the Academy of History and the Spanish Academy in 1814. He escaped to France in 1813, but returned a year later. He was not permitted to reside at Madrid until 1816. Two years later he was re-elected to his former seats by both academies. Conde died in poverty on the 12 June 1820. George Ticknor, American Hispanist at Harvard University and several Spanish friends Leandro Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n, Francisco Mart√≠nez de la Rosa and Agust√≠n Arg√ºelles paid his funeral expenses. Personal information Conde born at La Peraleja, Cuenca, in present-day Spain on 28 October 1766. He married a 20-year-old cousin of Leandro Fern√°ndez de Moratin, who died in childbirth in September 1817. Legacy His major work, Historia de la Dominaci√≥n de los √Årabes en Espa√±a, was published in 1820-1821\\\\. He completed only the first volume before his death. Juan Tineo compiled volumes two and three from Conde's manuscript. This work was translated into German (1824-1825), French (1825) and English (1854). Although it has since been superseded by other works, Conde's work stimulated others in the same field and in the context of time it was considered a valuable work. Another of Conde's works was his translation and annotation of Thekr al Andalus taleef Sherif Aledris / Descripci√≥n de Espa√±a de Xerif Aledris, conocido por El Nubiense, first published in Madrid by the Imprenta Real in 1799.Reprinted Madrid: Guillermo Bl√°zquez, 2003.

Lying between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland, northeast of Port McNeill and not far from Alert Bay, the island is part of the historic and present territory of the ‚ÄòNamgis First Nation. At the 2011 census, the village had a population of 576, down 3.0% from the 2006 census. The name Sointula means \\"Place of Harmony\\" (literally 'the place of chord') in the Finnish language. A group of Finnish settlers founded the village in 1901 after rowing north from Nanaimo. They planned to set up a utopian socialist (cult) society known as the Kalevan Kansa, and wrote to visionary Matti Kurikka in Finland to lead the new community. They were looking for a way out of the mines operated by the Dunsmuir family on Vancouver Island. It was a physically hard life, and a devastating fire in the Sointula community hall in 1903 killed three adults and eight children almost bringing the fledgling community to its knees. Kalervo Oberg, a Finnish-Canadian anthropologist born in 1901, came with his family to Sointula in 1902, and they were caught in the fire of 1903. Two of his sisters died in the fire. Financial difficulties continued to plague the group. They worked for free for two years on the Capilano Bridge project, and after that the Kalevan Kansa was disbanded, but many of the community members remained on the island, as have their descendants. The town remained and eventually prospered well into the 1970s as an unusually vibrant resource-based settlement. Fishing and logging activities have been the mainstay for the community. The early cooperative ventures led to other businesses that are still operating, planting seeds that are also alive today. The Sointula Cooperative Store, the oldest co-op shop in the province, still handles dry goods, groceries and fuel for the islanders. In addition there is a cooperative bakery, Wild Island Foods, which served Finnish bread (pulla) and home-cooked meals until the summer of 2008. The shellfish cooperative, Malcolm Island Shellfish Coop (MISC), was involved in research on the feasibility of raising and selling abalone, but closed for financial reasons in 2006. It relocated the abalone to an area near Port McNeill donated by Orca Sand and Gravel. In the 21st century, declining forestry and fishing industries have hit Sointula hard. Its school-age population has shrunk, although housing prices have risen, as owners from as far as California have bought homes as summer retreats. Sointula is home to the Sointula Museum, and produces an online newsletter, the Sointula Ripple. It is easy to reach by car ferry, operated by BC Ferries from Port McNeill and Alert Bay. Wildlife on the island and in the waters around it is abundant. Orcas return to the so-called \\"rubbing beaches\\" on Malcolm Island's northern edge near Bere Point Regional Park every summer and fall. Seals and porpoises can be viewed from the beaches. Birds, mink, otter, beaver, and deer live all over the island. The temperate rainforest vegetation helps to sustain the mood of an uncluttered and peaceful haven. Bill Gaston's novel Sointula (2004) is named for the community and has a plot that revolves in part around it. Rachel Lebowitz's book Hannus (2006) is also partly about the early days of the commune. Paula Wild's book Sointula gives a good overview of the island‚Äôs ways and history. More recently, Sointula Museum, collaborating with the University of Victoria, has published Practical Dreamers, a history of the island's cooperatives complete with many historical pictures. In 2013 a Finnish troupe performed the play Sointula in the village. The troupe had raised $50,000 to be able to visit Sointula and perform. Sointula is also the location of Living Oceans Society's head office, although it also has an office in Vancouver. Living Oceans Society, founded in 1998, is a non-profit research and public education organization committed to conserving marine biological diversity in order to ensure a healthy ocean and healthy coastal communities. It is Canada's largest non-governmental organization focused on marine conservation issues.

It is based on David Lavallee's 1971 novel Event 1000. Plot Aging, respected Captain Paul Blanchard (Heston) is on his final submarine tour before promotion to command of a submarine squadron (COMSUBRON). Surfaced and returning to port, the submarine, USS Neptune, is struck by a Norwegian freighter en route to New York in heavy fog. With the engine room flooded and its main propulsion disabled, the Neptune sinks to a depth of 1,450 feet (442 meters or approx. 241.6 fathoms) on a canyon ledge above the ocean floor. A United States Navy rescue force, commanded by Captain Hal Bennett (Keach), arrives on the scene, but Neptune is subsequently rolled by a gravity slide to a greater angle that does not allow the Navy's Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) to complete its work. A small experimental submersible, Snark, is brought in to assist with the rescue. Snark is very capable, but run by a U.S. Navy officer misfit, Captain Don Gates (Carradine). The tiny submersible is the only hope for a rescue. Ultimately, the surviving members of the crew are rescued by the DSRV, thanks to Gates sacrificing himself by using the Snark to jam the Neptune in place as another gravity slide begins while the rescue is taking place. Moments later the gravity slide pushes the Neptune and the Snark off the ledge and into the ocean's abyss. The film ends with a somber Blanchard climbing out of the DSRV and being welcomed aboard the rescue ship USS Pigeon by Bennett and his officers.

G. Ballard, published in 1981. The plot follows an expedition to a North America rendered uninhabitable by an ecological disaster. Synopsis Hello America is set in 2114 AD, after an ecological collapse has rendered North America virtually uninhabitable. Most of the population evacuated to Europe and Asia. The bulk of the novel takes place when a European steamship, the SS Apollo, sails to America to try to discover the cause of increased radioactive fallout in England. Each of the crew members has a secret agenda, and is subject to their own psychological yearnings. Most of the Apollo's crew are descended from expatriate Americans who have become assimilated into European society, while still feeling some draw to their homeland. In the novel, the Soviet Union dammed the Bering Strait in the 1990s, thus changing global weather patterns by reversing the normally clockwise currents in the Pacific Ocean. Although the Russians were able to grow grain as far north as the Arctic Circle, a massive drought began east of the Rocky Mountains. West of the Rockies, the opposite problem was true. Further, much of coastal Asia froze over. The expedition eventually encounters survivors from a previous expedition. One of these survivors calls himself \\"President Charles Manson,\\" but none of the Apollo's crew understood the historical reference. In the end, it was implied that Europe needs America, if only as a place where the darker elements of the Western mindset can emerge without inconveniencing decent people. A kind of rebirth re-establishes something akin to the old order, allowing insanity to appear in small doses to everyone, rather than bottled up in one person where it proves to be really dangerous. Possibly for the first time ever, nuclear weapons are used for a constructive purpose, and the 'New World Order' that arises from the events of the book contains both the promise of a better future and the understated promise/threat of phantasmagoric horrors to come, though presumably in smaller doses. Interpretation Though the plot is a straightforward adventure, the book offers a subtle parody of American culture. For instance, the final President of the United States was the then- current governor Jerry Brown of California, who was a promising face in American politics at the time of the novel. His small, ironic role represents both the triumph and ultimate failure of West Coast liberalism of the late Cold War era: when faced with a massive ecological crisis that threatens (and indeed ultimately destroys) the nation, Brown's solution is to build a large youth center, a twice-life-size fiberglass replica of the Taj Mahal, and then abandons the country so he can devote himself to self-improvement. The novel states that Brown dies at age 114 in a Buddhist Monastery in a glaciated Japan. MediaClassic album= \\"Hello America\\" is a 1980 tune by British musical crew by Def Leppard from their album On Through the Night.

Reception Dave Langford reviewed Hello America for White Dwarf #46, and stated that \\"As I suspected, this is the book for those who think they don't like Ballard: set in an America being rediscovered after its collapse, it's full of marvellous things, from New York choked with golden sand to Los Angeles in a rain forest. It satirizes Ballard's own surreal version of the American Dream - I mean, a platoon of 44 robot US Presidents charging into action! - and ends with absurd optimism.

Pictures in 1950 to celebrate Bugs Bunny's 10th birthday that year, in which he recounts his life story to a reporter from the \\"Disassociated Press\\". Bugs talks about his birth, his rise to fame, the slow years, and how famous Vaudeville performer Elmer Fudd chooses him to be part of his act. Eventually the duo comes upon their classic formula of Hunter vs. Hare. The short also was the first (since The Unruly Hare) to use the title card music which would continue to be used in Bugs Bunny's cartoons.  Plot  The story begins when Bugs, while relaxing by his pool, gets a call from the \\"Disassociated Press,\\" stating that the public demands his life story. Over the phone, Bugs then proceeds to recount his rise to fame. Bugs relates that, while in the nursery immediately after he was born, he comes to the startling realization that he was \\"a rabbit in a human world.\\" By the time he begins to walk, he shows an impressive talent for entertainment by successfully playing the \\"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\\" on his toy piano. Some years later, he takes ballet academically and becomes the star pupil. After graduation, Bugs begins to pursue a professional career as a Broadway star (throwing out the script to Life with Father proclaiming it would never be a hit), but only manages to be a chorus boy in three productions: Girl of the Golden Vest, Wearing of the Grin, and Rosie's Cheeks. In all of the shows, he and the chorus sing the same song - \\"Oh! We're the boys of the chorus. We hope you like our show. We know you're rootin' for us. But, now we have to go.\\" After a performance, he is approached by a producer of an unnamed show. The show's star has become ill, and the producer wants Bugs to take his place. He agrees, but the audience is unimpressed by his performance and he is hooked off stage. Angered at the prospect of resuming work as a chorus boy, Bugs quits show business until he's offered the \\"right part.\\" That winter, Bugs confines himself to a bench in Central Park. Along with him are a few other out of work actors that appear as caricatures of Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Eddie Cantor, and Bing Crosby. One night Elmer Fudd, while passing through, recognizes Bugs and offers him a role as his sidekick in his vaudeville act. Bugs accepts, and the two embark on a nationwide tour. The act consists of Elmer telling a joke to Bugs and physically delivering the punchline. After several performances, Bugs tires of the act, and decides to change the routine. So when Elmer sets up the joke, Bugs delivers the punchline, just as physically as Elmer had, and dances off-stage. Elmer is infuriated and, pointing his rifle at Bugs, backs the rabbit back onstage as the crowd laughs. Bugs then nervously delivers his famous line: \\"What's up, doc?\\" The audience cheers at this, to the surprise of the two; Bugs suggests they may have a new gimmick for the act and says, \\"Let's do it again.\\" They do, and receive the same positive audience response. Afterward, fan mail and offers pour in, and the two of them attract the attention of Warner Bros. Elmer and Bugs pass a screen test in which they perform the title musical number, and the studio signs them on as film stars. The story reverts to the present day. Bugs looks at his watch and notices that he is late to the set to begin filming his first role, in a film that was written with him in mind. At the filming, it is revealed that the part is chorus boy yet again, much to Bugs' disappointment and disgust.  Notes  * Bugs turns down dozens of scripts, including one entitled Life With Father. Bugs predicts: \\"Ehhh...this will never be a hit.\\" It actually ran for 3,224 performances (1939-1947) on Broadway, making it the longest-running non-musical play in Broadway history.\\"What's Up, Doc?\\". www.bcdb.com, August 31, 2013 *Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Eddie Cantor and Bing Crosby are caricatured as park bums, who each do their routine when Elmer Fudd shows up.

Carte de visite of Abraham Cooper, 1860s. Abraham Cooper (1787‚Äì1868) was a British animal and battle painter. Life The son of a tobacconist, he was born in Greenwich, London.\\"Fighting for the Standard at the Battle of Marston Moor\\", Metropolitan Museum of Art collections. Retrieved 10 June 2015 At the age of thirteen he became an employee at Astley's Amphitheatre, and was afterwards a groom in the service of Henry Meux, a brewer and later the first of the Meux baronets. When he was twenty- two, wishing to possess a portrait of a favorite horse under his care, he bought a manual of painting, learned something of the use of oil-colours, and painted the picture on a canvas hung against the stable wall. His master bought it and encouraged him to continue in his efforts. He accordingly began to copy prints of horses, and was introduced to Benjamin Marshall, the animal painter, who took him into his studio, and seems to have introduced him to the Sporting Magazine, an illustrated periodical to which he was himself a contributor. In 1814 he exhibited his Tam O'Shanter, and in 1816 he won a prize for his Battle of Ligny. In 1817 he exhibited his Battle of Marston Moor and was made associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1820 he was elected Academician. Cooper, although ill-educated, was a clever and conscientious artist; his colouring was somewhat flat and dead, but he was a master of equine portraiture and anatomy, and had some antiquarian knowledge. He had a special fondness for Cavalier and Roundhead pictures.

He became one of the best-known highlife musicians of the 1960s in Africa when Cardinal and his band dominated Nigeria's highlife scene. Early life Rex Lawson was born in 1938 in Buguma, Nigeria to a Kalabari chieftain father and an Igbo mother from Owerri. He was given the name Erekeosima which translates to \\"do not name this one\\" due to his father's belief that he would not live past infancy.https://guardian.ng/art/revue/cardinal-jim-rex-lawson-49-years-of- enduring-legacy/. He was the fourth child to his parents, the others having died of illnesses. At a young age, Lawson was afflicted with a severe case of small pox. While his mother brought him to various medicine men outside of Kalabari for treatment, his father feared he would die and lost interest in raising him. Lawson later sued his father for neglect while he was at school. He won the case, but his father cursed him in return, and the two did not communicate with one another until Lawson began his musical career. Musical career Rex Lawson began his career in Port Harcourt as a bandboy for Lord Eddyson's Starlight Melody Orchestra. He later played with Sammy Obot, Bobby Benson, Victor Olaiya, Chris Ajilo, and other Ghanaian and Nigerian musicians and bands. His greatest success came as the leader of the Majors Band (also called the Rivers Men in later years); their recorded hits include So ala teme, Yellow Sisi, Gowon Special, and Jolly Papa. By 1965 Lawson had written more than 100 songs. In July 1970 he traveled to the United Kingdom, where from then until September he recorded an album, Rex Lawson in London.  Style and musical themes  A highly emotional and deep musician, Lawson was known to weep and shed tears while singing his own songs on stage, notably the haunting So ala teme. The late Sir Maliki Showman, the famous Nigerian tenor saxophonist who played with Rex Lawson, Bobby Benson and Victor Uwaifo, remembers Lawson as always placing music over money. Lawson is famed for his infectious gregariousness, his musical vision, talent, perseverance and individuality.http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rex+Jim+Lawson?filter_anv=1&anv;=Cardinal+Rex+Jim+Lawson. He was able to sing in many different languages and dialects such as Kalabari, Nembe, Ijaw(Izon), Igbo, Urhobo, Ibibio, Efik and those of Cameroon and Ghana.http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2018/01/19/tribute-to-rex-lawson/ In most Highlife bands, the trumpet often played a leading role in the music that they played. Lawson broke from this trend by frequently featuring alto saxophone solos in his songs. Death Lawson died on 18 January 1971 in a car accident at the Urhamigbe corner on the Asaba‚ÄìBenin Road while on his way to Warri, Nigeria for a performance. He was 36 years old. After his death, his band continued as the Professional Seagulls.Collins (1985), p. 51. Lawson was married to Chief (Mrs.) Regina Rex Lawson who died in October 2008.

Throughout his career, Brand has specialised in the art of Asia, in particular Indian art. Early life Brand was born in Canberra, but spent several years in the United States while his father was a representative at the International Monetary Fund. He lived in McLean, Virginia in 1971 and 1972, and spent four years studying in Washington, D.C. to complete high school. Education Brand completed his undergraduate studies at the Australian National University in 1979, specialising in Art History and Asian Studies, and attained an MA and PhD at Harvard University in 1982 and 1987 respectively. Career After completing his studies, Brand worked as the founding head of Asian art at the National Gallery of Australia. He left for the Queensland Art Gallery later that year, and spent four years working as assistant director. In 2000 he moved to Richmond, Virginia to succeed Katherine C. Lee as director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. In August 2005 Brand was appointed director of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, refuting speculation that he may have accepted the post of director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, where he would once again have been following in Lee's footsteps. Brand took up the role of director in January 2006. In 2012, Brand was appointed ninth Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, following the retirement of Edmund Capon.

What issues are procedural? This is a part of the process called characterisation. Issues identified as procedural include the following: *By initiating the action before the forum court, the plaintiff is asking for the grant of the local remedies. This will not be a problem so long as the form of the relief is broadly similar to the relief available under the lex causae, i.e. the law selected under the choice of law rules. But forum courts may refuse a remedy in two situations: ::if the effect of granting the relief sought would offend against the public policy of the forum court; ::if the effect of the relief would be so different from that available under the lex causae that it makes the right sought to be enforced a different right. For example, in English law, the court was asked in Phrantzes v Argenti [1960] 2 QB 19 to enforce a Greek marriage dowry agreement. Although the forum had no public policy objections and agreed that such agreements were enforceable, relief was denied because there were no local rules to calculate the amount to be paid. A different result would have been achieved if the agreement had stipulated a liquidated sum to be paid. Thus, in Shahnaz v Rizwan [1965] 1 QB 390, a deferred mahr (dowry) was enforced as part of an ante-nuptial agreement made in India in consideration of marriage at a time when ante-nuptial agreements were not generally enforceable under English law. The judge accepted the difference between maintenance and a dowry, and enforced payment as a right ex contractu rather than as a matrimonial right. Hence, a remedy was granted to enforce a right in personam, enforceable by the wife or widow against the husband or his heirs. The same result is achieved in the United States, see Aziz v. Aziz [1985] where a New York court enforced a deferred mahr of $5,000 because the terms of the contract complied with New York's General Obligations Law. The court rejected the husband's claim that it was a matrimonial action. *The local law determines who can sue and be sued as parties to the action. The case law on this question is not very consistent. For example, the English court held in Banque Internationale de Commerce de Petrograd v Goukassow [1923] 2 KB 682 that a dead person cannot be a party to an action even though this was possible under the lex causae. However, if a foreign entity has legal personality under the law where it was established, it can be a party to English proceedings. Thus, in Bumper Development Corp. v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [1991] 1 WLR 1362 an Indian temple that was \\"little more than a pile of stones\\" could be a party. *All questions of evidence to determine the admissibility and probative value of evidence and whether a witness is competent, are dealt with under the lex fori, except that presumptions, both rebuttable and irrebuttable, are usually rules of substance. In some cases, the application of the lex fori makes sense‚Äîafter all, if the forum rules require legal documents to be printed in a twelve- point font, and the choice of law state requires the same documents to be printed in a fourteen-point font, it makes little sense to require the court to determine which font size should be used in a choice of law dispute. However, many contentious cases have centred on findings that issues such as the burdens of proof, the admissibility of evidence, and statutes of limitations are procedural rather than substantive, because these rules can change the outcome of a case. *In the Law of Contract Article 10(c) EC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome 1980) provides that the assessment of damages is a matter for the lex causae. In other cases, the cause of action will give rise to issues that are both procedural and substantive. For example, in tort questions of remoteness and causation will be determined by the lex causae whereas the quantification of damages will be determined by the lex fori. *The status of statutes of limitations is usually regarded as having public policy implications, particularly where foreign periods are either very long or very short. In extreme cases, the lex fori will be applied to protect the interests of vulnerable parties, e.g. the English court held in Jones v Trollope Colls Cementation, The Times, January 26, 1990, that a foreign limitation period of twelve months would be ignored because the plaintiff had spent a significant proportion of this time in hospital and had been led to believe her claim would be met. In the U.S., statutes of limitations would normally be considered procedural, but most states have enacted so-called borrowing statutes, which \\"borrow\\" the statute of limitations for the cause of action from the state in which the cause of action arose. *The lex fori determines whether a foreign judgment can be recognised and, if so, how it will be enforced, e.g. what property belonging to the defendant may be taken to satisfy the judgment (see enforcement of foreign judgments). But in the Law of Contract, this is subject to Article 10 of the Rome Convention 1980 which provides that the applicable law governs the consequences of breach, including the quantification of damages.

This building was originally built in 1911 and appears from the exterior as a castle with battlements. Its interior was destroyed by fire in 1968; the structure was rebuilt in 1985. The building currently houses the Department of Communication Studies, Theatre, and Dance. History At the start of the 20th century, the two major needs of the Kansas State University campus were a livestock pavilion and a gymnasium. The president of the University, E. R. Nichols, lobbied hard for money for these projects, and the gymnasium was christened Nichols Hall in his honor after he retired in 1909. =Construction= The initial funding and construction of Nichols Hall began during 1910 and was finished in 1911. The initial budget for the construction was $25,197. More money was allocated the following year to finish the building. Construction of the building included the use of state-of-the-art construction techniques. Nichols Hall was one of the first buildings in the United States to be built using continuously poured concrete flooring. The concrete was mixed using horses. =Early uses= The building provided a wrestling and basketball gymnasium and contained two swimming pools in the basement. Integration of swimming classes in 1920 ended the segregation of the pools between men and women. The building also housed facilities for physical education (now the Department of Kinesiology) and, until World War II, the Department of Military Science.https://www.k-state.edu/military- science/about/history.html Additionally, the building was used for commencement ceremonies. The second educational FM radio station in Kansas, KSDB-FM, began operations in the building in 1949. The initial broadcast strength of the station was 10 watts, a level barely sufficient to cover the city of Manhattan.http://www.wildcatradio.k-state.edu/History.htm Due to crowding during basketball games, the university built Ahearn Fieldhouse in 1951 as a venue for basketball and other sporting events, as well as commencements. Some activities of the Music Department were then moved into Nichols Hall, including the storage of musical instruments and sheet music for the marching band. Women's physical education classes also began using the building. =The Nichols Hall fire= On December 13, 1968, a fire gutted the building. The fire started when an arsonist stacked wooden tables against the front doors of the building, poured gasoline on them, and set them ablaze. The arsonist was never apprehended. Contrary to erroneous information publicized in the years following the fire,https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:MGAvp9i7CTEJ:https://www.kstatecollegian.com/2006/08/25/through- the-decades-ufms-mission-remains/+&cd;=1&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=us Nichols Hall did not house the military science department at the time of the fire. In fact, the Department of Military Science had moved out of Nichols Hall and into its present building (then known as the Military Science Building, currently Gen. Richard B. Myers Hall), located on the opposite side of campus, in 1943https://www.k-state.edu/military-science/about/history.html \\\\-- 25 years prior to the 1968 Nichols Hall fire (and more than 20 years before the start of the Vietnam War). The fire destroyed all of the band instruments and sheet music stored inside the building. By an odd coincidence, the music director, Phil Hewett, happened to have the \\"Wabash Cannonball\\" in his briefcase the night of the fire. This was the only music available for the band to play in a game against Syracuse a few nights later. As a result, the song became one of the main fight songs of the university. The total damage was estimated at $500,000. =Rebuilding Nichols Hall= The building was completely destroyed, except for the stout stone walls which remained standing empty for more than a decade after the fire. In the Spring of 1979, University President Duane C. Acker announced that he intended to raze the remnants and build a parking lot in its place. Hundreds of students spontaneously gathered in protest outside of President Acker's offices in Anderson Hall. A smaller group of students moved their protest to the halls of the state legislature in Topeka where they managed to get funding for the demolition of the building deleted from the budget and replaced with $10,000 in funding for a rebuilding feasibility study. This organic, grass-roots effort by concerned students, along with the positive results of the feasibility study, convinced the university and the legislature to appropriate approximately $6 million for the project, and restoration efforts began in 1983. The building was to be rebuilt using the existing walls. However, an engineering inspection determined that the walls were too weak to support the structure. Thus, a new structure was built inside of the existing walls and then attached to them. As a result, the building's exterior walls are nearly three feet thick. The reconstructed building features a glass topped atrium and contains a modern theater, classrooms, and offices. The building was reopened and rededicated on November 16, 1985. The east wall of the atrium contains a large mural commissioned by Eric Bransby titled Student Achievement. The mural, dedicated on October 10, 1986, depicts the various uses the building has had during its history. Nichols Hall today The building has housed the Department of Communication Studies, Theatre, and Dance since it was rebuilt in 1985. The department's main office is located in the building, as well as a number of classrooms, dance studios, and the Mark A. Chapman Theatre. The Department of Computer Science resided in Nichols Hall from 1985 until 2016, when the department relocated to the College of Engineering Phase IV Expansion.

He and his co-authors, Ann Eckels and Ken Squires, are credited with the discovery that the Earth had a significant third degree zonal spherical harmonic in its gravitational field using U.S. Vanguard 1 satellite data collected in the late 1950s.O‚ÄôKEEFE, J. A., ECKEIS, A., & SQUIRES, R. K. (1959). Vanguard Measurements Give Pear-Shaped Component of Earth‚Äôs Figure. Science, 129(3348), 565‚Äì566. doi:10.1126/science.129.3348.565. The Earth's pear shape as it was known became front-page news and was even the subject of a \\"Peanuts\\" cartoon. For that, he is credited as the \\"father of space geodesy\\". He was the first to propose the idea of a scanning microscope in 1956 and he is the co-discoverer of the YORP effect (short for Yarkovsky-O‚ÄôKeefe-Radzievskii-Paddock effect), an effect resulting from sunlight which causes a small celestial body such as an asteroid or meteor to spin up or down. BiographyEarly Years= O'Keefe was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on October 13, 1916. He was the oldest of four children of Edward Scott O'Keefe and Ruth Evans. O'Keefe spent his last two years of high school at Exeter Academy. He then went to Harvard, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfathers on both sides as well as all four of his uncles. He graduated in 1937 with an A.B. degree in astronomy. He spent another year at the Harvard College Observatory doing graduate study under Harlow Shapley. At Shapley's urging he went on to graduate studies at the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago where he earned his Ph.D. in Astronomy in 1941. His first major discovery, while in graduate school (1938}, was that clouds of solid carbon cause the peculiar dips in the light curve of R Coronae Borealis, the archetype of a class of carbon-rich stars. After earning his doctorate he spent a year at Brenau University teaching Mathematics and Physics. =Army Map Service Career= When World War II broke out, O'Keefe was rejected by the draft so he instead joined the Army Map Service Corps of Engineers as a civilian producing improved maps for the war effort. He continued this work during the cold war. His best-know prot√©g√© at Army Map Service was William M. Kaula who went on to become an authority on satellite geodesy. =NASA Career= O'Keefe joined NASA in December of 1958 and became the assistant chief of the Theoretical Division under Robert Jastrow at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. He spent the rest of his professional career at Goddard. During the early Project Apollo-era, O'Keefe was one of the major leaders in developing the American lunar science program and was instrumental in securing astrogeologist Eugene Shoemaker to work with NASA in developing a geology program for the Apollo astronauts. Shoemaker referred to O'Keefe as the \\"godfather of astrogeology\\". In 1997, Shoemaker and his wife, Carolyn, named asteroid 6585 after O'Keefe. Prior to the moon landings O'Keefe developed a theory that tektites, natural glass objects found in discrete strewn fields around the world, are actually volcanic ejecta from the Moon. He suggested that explosive, hydrogen-driven lunar volcanoes may be the mechanism that launched the tektites to Earth. After the moon landings his claim was apparently supported by a chemical analysis of a portion of lunar sample 12013 retrieved by Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad that showed a similar major element composition to some tektites found in Southeast Asia. Some Apollo 14 samples also had chemistries similar to tektites. However, most other lunar data strongly challenged the O'Keefe hypothesis, and almost all researchers in this field now accept that tektites are of terrestrial origin, the products of large meteorite or cometary impacts on Earth. This is supported by geochemical, isotopic and mineralogical evidence, and the fact that most tektite strewn fields can now be confidently matched to known impact craters of similar age on Earth. Several of O'Keefe's ideas about the physics of tektite formation, especially pertaining to Stokes' Law and the slow formation or 'fining' of tektites (apparently not possible in a rapid impact event), still remain as challenges to modern explanations of how tektites might have formed. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center conferred its highest honor, the Award of Merit, on O'Keefe in 1992. Advancing Parkinson's disease forced him to retire in 1995. Personal Life While at the Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, O'Keefe and other graduate students took their meals at the Tulane house. Here he met his future wife, Martha Sylvia Tulane. They later settled in Chevy Chase, Maryland where they had three sons and six daughters. Their second son, Roy Tulane O'Keefe (Michele Bourdeau) was born on January 5, 1946. Roy joined the Army in 1965, and later was a medic in the Special Forces. He was killed in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive on February 6, 1968. The children all attended Blessed Sacrament grade school in Chevy Chase. The sons all attended the Abbey School in Washington, D.C. O'Keefe was Roman Catholic. =Death= O'Keefe died on September 8, 2000 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota from complications of liver cancer and Parkinson's disease. He was surrounded by his wife and children. NotesReferences * Gray, M. Angle of Attack: Harrison Storms and the Race to the Moon. W.W. Norton, New York: 1992. * O'Keefe, J.A.

Seymour Skinner (non-canonically born Armin Tamzarian)) is a recurring fictional character in the animated sitcom The Simpsons, who is voiced by Harry Shearer. He is the principal of Springfield Elementary School, which he struggles to control, and is constantly engaged in a battle against its inadequate resources, apathetic and bitter teachers, and often rowdy and unenthusiastic students, Bart Simpson being a standout example. A strict disciplinarian, Skinner has an uptight, militaristic attitude that stems from his years in the United States Army as a Green Beret, which included service in the Vietnam War, where he was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He is quick to take orders from his superiors; chiefly his mother, Agnes, and Superintendent Chalmers. Role in The Simpsons Out of genuine concern for the quality of education of his students, most of Skinner's actions revolve around ensuring the school has adequate funding. His constant, desperate, and usually ineffective attempts at maintaining discipline are an effort to receive good reviews in the frequent inspections of his very strict boss, Superintendent Chalmers‚Äîwho makes no effort to hide his disapproval of Skinner. These inspections usually turn awry due to Bart Simpson's elaborate pranks‚Äîwhich play-off Skinner's desperation for order. Over the years of pranks and inspections, though, Skinner has developed a love-hate relationship with Bart; when Skinner was fired and replaced by Ned Flanders, Bart found pranks less meaningful, due to Flanders' lax approach to discipline, while Skinner missed his constant battles with Bart. The two bonded during this time and Bart made an effort to get Skinner reinstated in the school. One of Skinner's defining traits is that he has served as a Green Beret sergeant during the Vietnam War, where he has been captured by the Viet Cong at the Battle of Khe Sanh and has spent three years as a prisoner of war.The Simpsons episode \\"I Love Lisa\\"The Simpsons episode \\"Team Homer\\" Seeing his entire platoon devoured by an elephant has been one of the many things that led to the development of his posttraumatic stress disorder. He is also quite bitter about the treatment he and other Vietnam veterans have received upon returning from the war. Skinner is a highly skilled combatant, particularly hand-to- hand, and demonstrates his abilities in several episodes. Skinner often seems weak-willed and easily suppressed, but often will use his military command experience gained in the Vietnam War to get real respect and discipline. When he and the students are snowed-in at the school, he treats them like his squad to control the chaos temporarily, before they mutiny. Although Skinner likes to maintain the image of a strict disciplinarian, he is often weak-willed and nervous and has a very unhealthy dependence on his mother, who constantly torments him and nicknames him \\"Spanky\\".The Simpsons episode \\"The Crepes of Wrath\\" Aside from a short-lived relationship with Patty Bouvier, most of Skinner's love life is focused on Edna Krabappel. He and Edna kiss in Martin's playhouse after they are invited to a birthday party, and they are witnessed by Bart. He loses his job along with Edna when Superintendent Chalmers is advised of their romance by Chief Wiggum, after which Skinner and Edna lock themselves in the school with Bart demanding their jobs back. After Skinner is reinstated, he and Edna date for several more years and become engaged, but later cancel the wedding. Edna has shown she does want to continue dating Skinner, but first wants him to commit to her‚Äînamely by not letting his mother, with whom he still lives, control him anymore. The controversial season 9 episode \\"The Principal and the Pauper\\" heavily alters Skinner's backstory, revealing him as an impostor. Born as Armin Tamzarian, he has been a troubled orphan from Capital City, who is forced into the US Army during the Vietnam War. There, he serves as a Green Beret under Sgt. Seymour Skinner, whom he comes to idolize and befriend. When the sergeant is reported missing and presumed dead, Armin returns to Springfield to inform Skinner's mother, Agnes, but she deliberately mistakes him for Seymour, so he assumes his identity and follows Skinner's dream of becoming a school principal. The real Seymour Skinner (voiced by Martin Sheen), is alive after all, and briefly returns to Springfield to take his rightful place as Springfield Elementary School Principal, but proves hopelessly unpopular and the Springfielders run him out of town on the railroad. Judge Snyder grants Tamzarian Skinner's \\"name, and his past, present, future, and mother\\", and decrees that no one will mention his true identity again \\"under penalty of torture\\" (although Lisa uses the real name in the episode \\"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\\"). A clip from the episode is used in season eleven's \\"Behind the Laughter\\" as an example of the show's increasingly \\"gimmicky and nonsensical plots\\". The continuity of the series appears to revert to the original story of Seymour Skinner in the 2010 episode \\"Boy Meets Curl\\", as he is clearly shown to kick Agnes Skinner in utero, establishing him as Agnes' biological son after all. This is further declared in the Season 29 episode \\"Grampy Can Ya Hear Me\\" where a teenage Seymour is shown living with Agnes before going off to college. Another part of Principal Skinner's backstory is revealed in the season 21 episode \\"Pranks and Greens\\". When Bart Simpson plays numerous pranks on teachers of the school, Skinner reveals to Bart that there was a student who was an even better prankster than him. Bart is eager to discover the prankster's identity. Later, Groundskeeper Willie tells him the story: years ago, the school had a swimming pool and team, with Willie as their coach. Skinner was a more easygoing principal, but it all changed when student Andy Hamilton filled the pool with worms and locked Skinner in there for a long weekend (Monday being a teachers' holiday, Skinner was not rescued until Tuesday morning). This experience has caused him to become serious and almost merciless in his approach to rules, even going as far as to shut down the pool and demoting Willie, the swim teacher, to groundskeeper. CharacterCreation= Principal Skinner first appeared in \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", which was also the first Simpsons episode to air. The first drawing of Skinner was done by Matt Groening,Silverman, David. (2001). Commentary for \\"Bart the Genius\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. who based him on \\"all the principals of [his] youth, rolled into one bland lump.\\" Writer Jon Vitti named him after behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner.Reiss, Mike. (2002). Commentary for \\"Principal Charming\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. An original idea for Skinner was that he would continually mispronounce words. He does this in the series premiere \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", but the idea was later dropped.Groening, Matt. (2001). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Skinner was originally supposed to wear a toup√©e, but it was dropped because the writers didn't like \\"that type of joke\\".Groening, Matt. (2002). Commentary for \\"Principal Charming\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete SecondSeason [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In later episodes, Skinner's behavior was based on teachers that Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein had in high school.Weinstein, Josh. (2004). Commentary for \\"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =Development= Superintendent Chalmers was introduced in the episode \\"Whacking Day\\" as a boss for Skinner. Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria, the voice of Chalmers, fell right into the characters and quite often ad-lib between them.Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for \\"Whacking Day\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =\\"The Principal and the Pauper\\"= In \\"The Principal and the Pauper\\", it is revealed that Skinner was not who he claimed to be and was really named Armin Tamzarian. The episode was pitched and written by Ken Keeler, who was inspired by the Tichborne case of 19th-century England.Keeler, Ken. (2006). Commentary for \\"The Principal and the Pauper\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Producers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were excited about the episode because Principal Skinner was one of their favorite characters. They \\"spent a month immersed in the mind of Seymour Skinner\\" to prepare that episode, and from that point forward, took every opportunity to \\"tinker with [Skinner's] personality and his backstory and his homelife.\\" They intended for the episode to be \\"an experiment\\" and that the ending was meant to allow viewers to reset to the point before Skinner was revealed to be an impostor.Oakley, Bill. (2006). Commentary for \\"The Principal and the Pauper\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The revelation that Principal Skinner was not whom the audience had long been led to believe (as well as the self-referential deus ex machina ending of the episode) was negatively received by many fans and critics, and is considered by some to be the point at which the series as a whole jumped the shark. Oakley considers \\"The Principal and the Pauper\\" the most controversial episode from his tenure as executive producer. In April 2001, in an interview, Harry Shearer, the voice of Principal Skinner, recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, \\"That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.\\" The writers themselves have since mocked the inconsistencies created by the episode; in the season 15 episode \\"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\\", Lisa is seen writing Snowball II on a cat food dish to save money after what would be the fourth Snowball's purchase. Skinner walks by and asks \\"that's really a cheat, isn't it?\\" to which Lisa pointedly replies, \\"I guess you're right, Principal Tamzarian.\\" Skinner then quickly excuses himself to Lisa and walks away.

It broadcasts on 96.9 MHz with 3,000 watts and is owned by Radio First. This is the third owner in the station's 15-year history. WBTI's transmitter is located south of Lexington off Gardener Line Road in Sanilac County. WBTI provides a rimshot signal to most of Port Huron, Marysville, and Sarnia, Ontario. The station's primary local competitors are Canadian counterpart CFGX-FM and mainstream AC WGRT in Port Huron. History WBTI went on the air in July 1991, owned by Timothy D. Martz of Martz Communications. Martz was a Canadian-born broadcaster with ambitions of purchasing or building a series of American radio stations near the border of the United States and Canada with the intent of providing quality radio that would also be of value to Canadian citizens, while at the same time not having to submit to the more rigid standards of programming required by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and had already had success in another Michigan/Ontario border market - Sault Ste. Marie - with 99.5 Yes-FM. As Sarnia, Ontario was about 25 minutes southeast of Lexington, it fell into this category. Initially, the station boasted a contemporary hit radio format and the moniker \\"B96.9, The Killer Bee\\". Though licensed to Lexington, almost a half-hour north of Port Huron, the station maintained its studios and offices in downtown Port Huron, where it would compete with WPHM, WHLS, WSAQ, WIFN, and WGRT. However, Martz's ownership of the station would be brief, as the station was sold to Hanson Communications, licensee of WPHM, for $325,000 the following year. Hanson Communications had failed to acquire the construction permit for a new FM in Port Huron after a lengthy series of competitive hearings, and turned its interests towards acquiring WBTI. Satisfied with the Top 40 format already on the air, Hanson Communications opted to leave it alone at first, but the station gradually shifted in the winter of 1995 to a hot adult contemporary (AC) format, and since then, has shifted back and forth between this format and Top 40, dropping the \\"Killer Bee\\" moniker by the end of the 20th century. Station management has been clever in recent years with their on-air legal IDs, doing their best to keep \\"WBTI-FM Lexington\\" to the bare minimum (once per hour per FCC regulations) and using \\"WBTI Port Huron\\" several times per hour. When it is the top of the hour WBTI is identified as \\"WBTI Lexington-Port Huron\\" with a \\"WBTI Port Huron\\" jingle immediately following. In keeping with an ongoing trend among Hot AC radio stations across the United States, WBTI has dropped most 1980s and 1990s music from rotation and transitioned to a Top 40 sound, reimaging from The Best of the '80s, '90s and Today to Today's Hit Music. This is a return to the station's roots, as it featured such a format throughout the 1990s and until 2002. The change helps differentiate the station more distinctly from rival mainstream AC stations WGRT, CFGX-FM and WTGV-FM. WBTI still plays '90s music on Sunday mornings. In the late hours at night, WBTI has been known to occasionally play some 90s rock and alternative hits that would typically be heard on sister station Rock 105.5. Examples would be Green Day, Eve 6, Kid Rock, and even Candlebox. Radio personalities Bob O'Dell and J.D. loved the fishbowl aspect of the building. The window allowed for traffic and passers by to interact with the talent.

During the early-to-mid 1990s \\"Nobody Beats The Wiz\\" was a major sponsor for all local NY sports franchises, including the Yankees, Knicks, Mets, New Jersey Nets, Rangers, New Jersey Devils and Islanders, and in other areas, the Baltimore Orioles, and had a significant television advertising presence during local sports events, including the infamous Jeffrey Maier Incident during Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS. It also sponsored teams outside the NY area such as the Flyers, Whalers and Canadiens. In 1998, after having expanded from roughly 20 stores to over 80 stores in less than a year, the chain filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by Cablevision for $80 million. Cablevision eventually dropped the \\"Nobody Beats the Wiz\\" slogan. At its peak, the firm's revenues were $1.4 billion, with 2000 employees, operating 94 stores in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts. It also operated music-only stores in Maryland and the Washington, D.C. area. left The chain closed permanently in 2003. A Cablevision press release from February 16, 2003 stated: \\"Continuing to operate the stores is no longer a viable option for Cablevision as business conditions at the retailer eroded due to a weakened retail economy and other factors.\\" Once the chain closed, one of its founders, Marvin Jemal, opened a new electronics chain, The Zone, in a number of former Wiz locations. The new chain, which heavily mentioned that it was from the founder of The Wiz, went out of business less than two years later. In September 2003, competitor P.C.

In popular culture In the Seinfeld episode \\"The Junk Mail\\", Elaine begins dating Jack (Toby Huss), a man with whom she has a \\"love at first sight\\" encounter. However, while viewing a VHS tape Jerry discovers an old commercial that features Jack as \\"The Wiz,\\" the ludicrous mascot for the electronics store, apparently explaining the mysterious aura of glamour Elaine experienced when meeting him in person. After seeing the tape, Elaine desperately attempts to reunite with her previous boyfriend, David Puddy, but she is rejected and she decides to take back Jack. She tells Jack her decision and he reveals that the electronics chain is bringing him back as its spokesman. Jack then dons his character's trademark crown and begins to march back and forth, ludicrous as ever, proclaiming, \\"I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and nobody beats me!\\" In the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street, Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Jordan Belfort, suggests answering a classified in the local paper looking for a stockboy at The Wiz. He is dissuaded by his wife. In the 1999 Thomas Harris novel Hannibal, Mason Verger recalls that at his family's Christian camp, they styled the Risen Christ as \\"the Riz\\" because \\"Nobody Beats the Riz\\". The jingle is interpolated in the chorus of Biz Markie's hit, \\"Nobody Beats the Biz\\". Biz substitutes \\"the Biz\\" for \\"the Wiz\\". The Wiz was rumored to have sued Biz Markie for infringement. In Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's 1988 hit \\"It Takes Two,\\" referring to his album, Base raps \\"Go to the Wiz and select it / Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back.\\" In the episode \\"Veiled Threat\\" from the show The King of Queens, Doug (in a flashback to his wedding day) mentions wanting a wedding gift of a CD player from The Wiz.

The gang passes out, and when they wake up, they appear to have bodies that look like black people to other people outside the gang and their own reflections.

Early life After passing his Baccalaur√©at, de S√®de began studying law and literature where he met his future wife Marie-Andr√©e at the Sorbonne. It was during this period that he established contacts with the Surrealists and began producing his first works. In 1941, he was a member of the Surrealist group \\"La Main √† Plume\\", which was named after a phrase by Rimbaud, \\"La main √† plume vaut la main √† charrue\\" (\\"The hand that writes is equal to the hand that ploughs\\"). The group published a series of pamphlets.

G√©rard de S√®de was active in the war during the German occupation of Paris, working with the Forces Fran√ßaises de l'Int√©rieur (FFI), for which he received two citations. He was imprisoned by the Germans in Bourges. Regarding the Resistance as a way of establishing a new world order, de S√®de moved about in Trotskyist circles. De S√®de married Marie-Andr√©e in February 1947, commonly known as 'Sophie', who had been his companion in the resistance. He decided to study philosophy and became a pupil of Gaston Bachelard, under whom he wrote a dissertation on Jean-Jacques Rousseau. At the beginning of the 1950s de S√®de associated with the poets Nazim Hikmet and Edouard Glissant, and with the philosopher Henri Lefebvre. At the same time he re-established contact with Andr√© Breton. Attracted by the politics of Marshal Tito, de S√®de moved to Yugoslavia with his wife and children before returning to France, holding several jobs in journalism before deciding to become a farmer. Gisors The 13th century keep of Gisors It was during his period as a farmer that he employed and got to know Roger Lhomoy - Lhomoy had previously worked since 1929 as a tourist guide at the Ch√¢teau de Gisors in Normandy and claimed to have discovered under the tower donjon in March 1946, a secret entrance to a long basement thirty meters long, nine meters wide, and approximately four and a half meters high, saying it was a subterranean chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine. He alleged it contained nineteen sarcophagi of stone, each two meters long and sixty centimeters wide, with 30 iron coffers arranged in columns of ten. Lhomoy said it was the treasure of the Knights TemplarCharles Dauzats, \\"Sous le donjon de Gisors, dans une crypte fabuleuse, un homme affirme avoir vu le tr√©sor des Templiers\\", in Noir et Blanc, pages 560-561, Number 913, 31 August 1962. These allegations inspired G√©rard de S√®de to write a magazine article about Gisors, that caught the attention of Pierre Plantard, who wrote to de S√®de. They collaborated on Les Templiers sont parmi nous, ou, L'Enigme de Gisors (\\"The Templars are Amongst Us, or The Enigma of Gisors\\"), that was published in 1962, containing passing references to the Priory of Sion. Lhomoy was finally dismissed as a liar when in 1964 an official excavation produced a negative result.\\"En 1964, l'heure est grave: devant une si forte pression populaire, il faut clarifier les choses.

Biblioth√®que nationale, EL 4-Z PIECE-110 and EL 4-Z PIECE-111 L'Or de Rennes Le Tr√©sor Maudit de Rennes-le-Chateau, 1968 De S√®de and Plantard collaborated next on the subject of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, resulting in the publication of L'Or de Rennes in 1967. Originally a Pierre Plantard manuscript that failed to find a publisher,Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair, L‚ÄôOr de Rennes, mise au point (La Garenne-Colombes, 35 bis, Bd de la R√©publique, 92250; Biblioth√®que Nationale, D√©p√¥t L√©gal 02-03-1979, 4¬∞ Z Piece 1182). and extensively rewritten by G√©rard de S√®de, L'Or de Rennes presented as fact various claims about B√©renger Sauni√®re and Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau that were the authors' inventions, in order to embellish a story about the discovery of a hidden secret. The book was most famous for its reproduction of two \\"parchments\\" that were allegedly discovered by the priest: but for a variety of different reasons they have been identified as forgeries by Philippe de Ch√©risey. The central claim in L'Or de Rennes was that Sauni√®re found parchments proving that the lineage of the \\"last\\" Merovingian king, Dagobert II, assassinated on 23 December 679, did not die with him as had previously been thought. His son was presumed to have escaped the massacre and took refuge at Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, where he founded a line of descent before being buried in 758 in the church crypt. These genealogical documents implicated to an exceptional degree the Priory of Sion, a secret organisation working behind the scenes ever since the Carolingian and Capetian usurpations for the recognition of the legitimacy of the Merovingian line of descent to the throne of France. Pierre Plantard claimed to be descended from Dagobert II. De S√®de and Plantard fell out over book royalties relating to L'Or de Rennes and never worked together again, at the same time Philippe de Ch√©risey announced the \\"parchments\\" were his creations that he later elaborated upon in his 1978 unpublished document entitled L'√ânigme de Rennes, claiming they were originally made for his friend Francis Blanche, as material for a French radio serial entitled Sign√© Furax.Philippe de Ch√©risey, L'√ânigme de Rennes.

It was created by Pierre Dac (real name Andr√© Isaac, 1893-1975) and Francis Blanche (1921-1974), and directed by Pierre-Arnaud de Chassy Poulay (Pierre Arnaud). A film adaption of the radio series, directed by Marc Simenon was released in 1981 . The story about the parchments was previously given in the 1977 document by Jean Delaude entitled Le Cercle d'Ulysse.\\"The so-called manuscripts presented by G√©rard de S√®de are false. The originals were fabricated in 1961 by Marquis Philippe de Ch√©risey and deposited in May 1962 with a solicitor, Ma√Ætre Boccon-Gibod. Also, G√©rard de S√®de only had photocopies of the originals as reproduced in his book L'Or de Rennes. Better still, this same marquis spiced up his joke by publishing in June 1971 (which he registered [at the Biblioth√®que Nationale]), a work on Rennes, with the decipherment of the original. The book is called Circuit.\\" In Jean Delaude, Le Cercle d'Ulysse (Toulouse, 1977). Biblioth√®que Nationale, 4- LK7- 51754. D√©p√¥t L√©gal, 4 August 1977. L'Or de Rennes was to have a lasting impact on British script-writer Henry Lincoln, who read the book while on holiday in the C√©vennes in 1969, leading him to inspire three BBC Two Chronicle documentaries, as well as working some of its material into the 1982 bestseller Holy Blood, Holy Grail which itself was used as source material for the bestselling 2003 novel by Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code. Later years G√©rard de S√®de returned to the subject matter of B√©renger Sauni√®re during the late 1980s writing Rennes-le- Ch√¢teau: le dossier, les impostures, les phantasmes, les hypoth√®ses, discounting the Plantard-related material that had appeared over the previous 20 years. He claimed Sauni√®re obtained his wealth from the Habsburgs in return for parchments containing \\"politico-genealogical secrets\\" about the descent of Louis XVII.G√©rard de S√®de, Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau: le dossier, les impostures, les phantasmes, les hypoth√®ses, page 255 (Paris: Robert Laffont, Les √ânigmes de l'univers collection, 1988). He claimed the \\"Merovingian romance\\" was a parody where Dagobert II replaced Louis XVI, his son Sigebert IV replaced Louis XVII and Pierre Plantard replaced Charles-Guillaume Naundorff.G√©rard de S√®de, Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau: le dossier, page 258 He afterwards moved to Nicaragua, then to Belgium, before returning to France during the 1990s.

Life and career Best known as \\"Willie\\", Carson was born in Stirling, Scotland in 1942. He was apprenticed to Captain Gerald Armstrong at his stables at Tupgill, North Yorkshire. His first winner in Britain was Pinker's Pond in a seven-furlong apprentice handicap at Catterick Bridge Racecourse on 19 July 1962. He was British Champion Jockey five times (1972, 1973, 1978, 1980 and 1983), won 17 British Classic Races, and passed 100 winners in a season 23 times for a total of 3,828 wins, making him the fourth most successful jockey in Great Britain. Willie Carson's best season as a jockey came in 1990 when he rode 187 winners. This included riding six winners at Newcastle Racecourse on 30 June, making Carson one of only four jockeys to ride six winners at one meeting during the 20th century. However, he came second in the 1990 jockeys' championship to Pat Eddery (who rode 209 winners). Carson had a long association with trainer Major Dick Hern for whom he rode his first three Derby winners. Five feet tall and riding at an easily maintained weight of Carson was much in demand as a jockey up to his retirement in 1996 at the age of 54. In 1980, he took over the Minster House Stud at Ampney Crucis near Cirencester and he and his wife Elaine have developed it into a state of the art stud complex. He is almost certainly the only jockey in the 20th century to have ridden a horse that he bred, Minster Son, to victory in one of the Classic races, the St. Leger Stakes 1988. He and his ex-wife Carol had three sons Anthony, Neil, and Ross. In 1983, Willie Carson was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to horse racing. From 1982 to 1983 Carson joined Bill Beaumont as one of the team captains for A Question of Sport. With Clare Balding, Carson co-presented BBC horse racing on BBC1 until the BBC ended their racing coverage at the end of the 2012 season. He was chairman of Swindon Town FC from 2001 until August 2007 when, following a takeover of the club by Best Holdings SGPS S.A, he was replaced by Jim Little. In November 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by University of Chester. In 2011, he came 5th in the eleventh series of ITV1's reality television show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.

It is a tributary of the Amu Darya river.\\"Tajikistan - Topography and Drainage\\" in Tajikistan: a Country Study (Washington: Library of Congress, 1996)  Geography  The river flows through the Pamirs, passing through very mountainous territory that frequently restricts its flow to narrow channels within deep gorges. Some of the largest glaciers in Tajikistan, including the Fedchenko and Abramov glaciers (the former of which is the longest glacier in the world outside of the polar regions), drain into the Vakhsh.Kai Wegerich, Oliver Olsson, and Jochen Forebrich, ‚ÄúReliving the past in a changed environment: Hydropower ambitions, opportunities and constraints in Tajikistan‚Äù, Energy Policy 35 (2007), 3815-3825 Its largest tributaries are the Muksu and the Obikhingou; the Vakhsh proper begins at the confluence of the Obikhingou and Surkhob rivers. After it exits the Pamirs, the Vakhsh passes through the fertile lowlands of southwest Tajikistan. It ends when it flows into the Panj to form the Amu Darya, at the border of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve, which was the last habitat of the now-extinct Caspian tiger in the former USSR, is located at the confluence of the Vakhsh and the Panj.Mary Pat Silviera et al., Environmental Performance Reviews: Tajikistan. (New York and Geneva: United Nations, 2004), 124 The catchment area of the Vakhsh is 39,100 km2, of which 31,200 km2 (79.8%) lies within Tajikistan. The river contributes about 25% of the total flow of the Amu Darya, its parent river. Its average discharge is 538 m3/s, with an annual discharge of 20.0 km3. However, since the Vakhsh is fed mostly by melting snow and glaciers, these flow rates have great seasonal variability between winter and summer. Measurements at the Nurek Dam indicate that winter flow rates average around 150 m3/s, whereas flow rates during the summer months can exceed 1500 m3/s ‚Äì a tenfold increase. Muk-Suu and Kyzyl-Suu  Economic development  The Vakhsh has been intensively developed for human use. Electricity, aluminum, and cotton are the mainstays of Tajikistan's economy,Silviera et al., Environmental Performance Reviews, 4 and the Vakhsh is involved with all three of these sectors. Hydroelectricity provides 91% of the country's electricity as of 2005, and 90% of that total comes from the five completed dams along the Vakhsh,‚ÄúVIII. Regional and Country Hydropower Profiles: CIS,‚Äù in Hydropower Report: Large & Small Hydropower (London: ABS Energy Research, 2005), 59-62. dominated by the world's second tallest dam, the Nurek. The other four dams, downstream of Nurek, are Baipaza, Sangtuda 1, Sangtuda 2 and Golovnaya Dams. (These dams make Tajikistan the highest hydroelectric power producer per capita in the world.Silviera et al., Environmental Performance Reviews, 104-109) Hydroelectricity powers the aluminum production at the Tajik Aluminum Company in Tursunzoda, a major source of Tajikistan's industrial output and export revenue. As for cotton, Vakhsh water irrigates much of Tajikistan's crop; about 85% of the water taken from the Vakhsh goes toward irrigation. = Soviet era = The leaders of the Soviet Union stressed the importance of developing the country's under-developed regions, such as the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (which was the predecessor to modern-day, independent Tajikistan). Not only did Vladimir Lenin‚Äôs ideology identify the decentralization of industry as a way to counter the colonial exploitation of indigenous peoples, but the USSR had strategic aims as well, especially in World War II when industry was evacuated eastward away from the German front.Violet Conolly, Beyond the Urals: Economic Developments in Soviet Asia (London: Oxford University Press, 1967), pp. 61-62 This industrialization would be fueled by exploiting Tajikistan's enormous hydropower potential. It took until the 1950s, however, for dam construction to begin on the Vakhsh. The Perepadnaya power station, was the first to be commissioned in 1959. It is situated on a canal off the Golovnaya Dam which was commissioned in 1963. The giant Nurek dam was constructed between 1961 and 1980. Baipaza Dam was completed in 1983. To build transmission lines over the Pamirs would have been prohibitively expensive, so, in order to take advantage of the electricity produced by these dams, the Soviet Union built many industries nearby.Conolly, Beyond the Urals, pp. 145-149 The Tajik Aluminum Company plant is a prime example. Other industries established locally were chemical plants, nitrogen fertilizer factories, and cotton gins.Conolly, Beyond the Urals, p. 172 The dams, particularly the reservoirs behind them, were also built with the purpose of providing water for agriculture. The Soviet Union promoted cotton farming in the Vakhsh Valley, as well as vineyards and orchards, and drew water from the Vakhsh for irrigation. The Vakhsh Valley Canal Project, which expanded farmland along the river's lower reaches, predated the dams, having been completed in 1933. In the 1960s, after the reservoirs had been constructed, engineers dug tunnels through the surrounding mountains to irrigate other valleys.Conolly, Beyond the Urals, pp. 208-220 Water storage in the reservoirs also helped control the river's flow, so as to provide a more reliable water supply for downstream users in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. = After Tajik independence = Soviet Central Asia had a centrally planned economy in which the different republics supplied resources to each other at different times of the year. During the summer, when river flows were greatest, Tajikistan (located upstream) released water from its reservoirs on the Vakhsh and exported the hydroelectricity to power irrigation pumps downstream, in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, along the Amu Darya. In winter, Tajik dams accumulated water, and the fossil-fuel-rich downstream nations supplied Tajikistan with oil and gas to compensate for forgone hydroelectricity generation. However, with increasing regional tension post- independence, this system is breaking down, with no conclusive cooperative arrangement yet. Fuel deliveries from downstream nations have been getting less reliable and more expensive, and impoverished Tajikistan cannot adapt by increasing winter hydroelectric generation since this would jeopardize irrigation and electricity exports in the summer. This dependence has caused energy crises in the winters of 2008 and 2009, in which the capital, Dushanbe, lost power and heating. Heightened nationalism and border disputes further complicate the search for a solution to Central Asia's water needs, according to a study conducted by the International Crisis Group.International Crisis Group. \\"Water Pressures in Central Asia\\", CrisisGroup.org. 11 September 2014. Retrieved 6 October 2014. Tajikistan is therefore pursuing a course of action to increase hydroelectric capacity by building more dams on the Vakhsh, in order to promote economic growth and move towards energy independence.Murodbek Laldjebaev, ‚ÄúThe Water-Energy Puzzle in Central Asia: The Tajikistan Perspective,‚Äù Water Resources Development 26 (2010): 23-34. Another four dams are planned or under construction, including the Rogun Dam. The Rogun Dam began construction in Soviet times but remains uncompleted; now Tajikistan has recommenced the project with financial support from the Russian Aluminum Company. If constructed to its full planned height, it will supersede the Nurek as tallest in the world. However, this project has caused great controversy. Just as energy dependence threatens Tajikistan, so water dependence threatens the downstream nations. For this reason, Uzbekistan is highly critical of the Rogun Dam, claiming that it would ‚Äúput it [Tajikistan] firmly in control of the river‚Äù. The World Bank has responded to these tensions by launching investigations into the social and environmental impacts of the dam.  Environmental problems  Intensive agriculture in the Vakhsh basin has left the river polluted with fertilizers, pesticides, and salts. Also, chemicals have leached into groundwater from the heavy industries near the Vakhsh's dams, which has in turn contaminated surface water. However, ever since Tajikistan lost their Soviet agricultural subsidies with the breakup of the Soviet Union, farms have not been able to afford as many fertilizers or pesticides as before, thus decreasing levels of pollution in the river.Silviera et al., Environmental Performance Reviews, 165 The 2008 financial crisis has further increased poverty, which in turn has further decreased pollution. Since the waters of the Vakhsh eventually flow into the Aral Sea, pollution in the Vakhsh contributes to eutrophication there. = Climate change impacts = The Vakhsh is fed by the glaciers of the Pamirs, one of the world's most susceptible regions to climate change. Tajikistan as a whole has experienced a rise in temperatures from between 1.0-1.2 degrees Celsius between 1940 and 2000, and many glaciers that feed the Vakhsh have retreated, including the Fedchenko, which is melting at a rate of 16‚Äì20 meters/year. According to Oxfam International, up to 30% of Tajikistan's glaciers could shrink or disappear completely by 2050. The reduction in river flow could lower the Vakhsh's hydropower production, and harm agriculture dependent on its waters for irrigation.Anita Swarup et al., \\"Reaching Tipping Point? Climate Change and Poverty in Tajikistan\\" (Dushanbe: Oxfam International, 2009), 1-22 Furthermore, if climate change affects precipitation patterns, it could cause more floods, landslides, and other natural disasters in the river valley.  Blockages  The Vakhsh is located in a seismically active region, and earthquakes, in addition to high groundwater levels (especially during the wet season), cause hundreds of landslides per year.Silviera et al., Environmental Performance Reviews, 17 These landslides occasionally block the river and form landslide dams. Such blockages pose a significant threat to the river's dams and hydroelectric power generation. A large landslide downstream from the Baipaza Dam has blocked the river twice (in 1992 and 2002) ever since this dam opened in 1985. Both blockages were immediately blasted to clear the river channel, since they threatened to raise the water level high enough to flood the dam. Such an event could potentially have serious economic consequences by disrupting power generation, stopping production at the Tajik Aluminum Company, and cutting off supplies of drinking and irrigation water for downstream users. In the worst- case scenario, failure of a landslide dam could cause catastrophic floods. Recognizing these threats, the Asian Development Bank responded to the landslide of 2002 by granting the government of Tajikistan a low-interest loan to stabilize the valley slopes and mitigate the potential for blockages in the future.Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Baipaza Landslide Stabilization Project (Manila: Asian Development Bank, 2003).

The area was inscribed on the World Heritage List at the 24th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cairns in 2000. Etymology The area is called \\"Blue Mountains\\" based on the fact that when atmospheric temperature rises, the essential oil of various eucalyptus species evaporates and disperses in the air, causing visible blue spectra of sunlight to propagates more than other colours. Therefore, reflections from the mountains seems bluish to human eyes.  Description  The area is one of rugged tablelands, sheer cliffs, deep, inaccessible valleys and rivers and lakes teeming with life. The rare plants and animals that live in this natural place relate an extraordinary story of Australia's antiquity, its diversity of life. This is the story of the evolution of Australia's unique eucalypt vegetation and its associated communities, plants and animals. The Greater Blue Mountains Area consists of of mostly forested landscape on a sandstone plateau inland from the Sydney central business district. The area includes vast expanses of wilderness and is equivalent in area to almost one third of Belgium, or twice the size of Brunei. The property, which includes eight protected areas in two blocks separated by a transportation and urban development corridor, is made up of seven outstanding national parks as well as the famous Jenolan Caves Karst Conservation Reserve. These are the Blue Mountains National Park, Wollemi National Park, Yengo National Park, Nattai National Park, Kanangra-Boyd National Park, Gardens of Stone National Park and Thirlmere Lakes National Park. The area does not contain mountains in the conventional sense but is described as a deeply incised sandstone plateau rising from less than above sea level to at the highest point. There are basalt outcrops on the higher ridges. This plateau is thought to have enabled the survival of a rich diversity of plant and animal life by providing a refuge from climatic changes during recent geological history. It is particularly noted for its wide and balanced representation of eucalypt habitats from wet and dry sclerophyll, mallee heathlands, as well as localised swamps, wetlands, and grassland. Ninety-one species of eucalypts (thirteen percent of the global total) occur in the Greater Blue Mountains Area. Twelve of these are believed to occur only in the Sydney sandstone region.  Flora  File:Three Sisters.pngThree Sisters, Blue Mountains National Park File:Lake burragorang aerial.jpgLake Burragorang File:Kanangra Walls 2002.jpgKanangra Walls at Kanangra-Boyd National Park File:Kanangra-Boyd National Park near Boyd River.JPGForest near Boyd River File:Kanangra winter wonderland.jpgBoyd River campground in winter (Kanangra-Boyd National Park) The area has been described as a natural laboratory for studying the evolution of the eucalypts. The largest area of high diversity of eucalypts on the continent is located in south-east Australia. The Greater Blue Mountains Area includes much of this eucalypt diversity. As well as supporting such a significant proportion of the world's eucalypt species, the area provides examples of the range of structural adaptations of the eucalypts to Australian environments. These vary from tall forests at the margins or rainforest in the deep valleys, through open forests and woodlands, to shrublands of stunted mallees on the exposed tablelands. In addition to its outstanding eucalypts, the Greater Blue Mountains Area also contains ancient, relict species of global significance. The most famous of these is the recently discovered Wollemi pine, a \\"living fossil\\" dating back to the age of the dinosaurs. Thought to have been extinct for millions of years, the few surviving trees of this ancient species are known only from three small populations located in remote, inaccessible gorges within the area. The Wollemi pine is one of the world's rarest species.  Fauna  File:Dingo Blue Mountains.jpgA dingo at Yengo National Park File:Unidentified kangaroo -Blue Mountains, New South Wales, Australia-8 (1).jpgRed-necked wallaby in the Blue Mountains File:White-browed Babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus).jpgWhite-browed babbler More than 400 different kinds of animals live within the rugged gorges and tablelands of the Greater Blue Mountains Area. These include threatened or rare species of conservation significance, such as the tiger quoll, the koala, the yellow-bellied glider and the long-nosed potoroo as well as rare reptiles and amphibians including the green and golden bell frog and the Blue Mountain water skink. The largest predator of the area is the dingo. These wild dogs hunt for grey kangaroos and other prey. The greater Blue Mountains region has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports a high proportion of the global populations of the range-restricted rockwarbler as well as populations of flame robins, diamond firetails and pilotbirds. The endangered regent honeyeater is seen there regularly. It is also a migration bottleneck for yellow-faced honeyeaters.  UNESCO listing  The Greater Blue Mountains Area was unanimously listed as a World Heritage Area by UNESCO on 29 November 2000. It thus became the fourth area in New South Wales to be listed.Gardens of Stone National Park Information Sheet, National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales, October 2001 The area totals roughly , including the Blue Mountains, Kanangra-Boyd, Wollemi, Gardens of Stone, Yengo, Nattai and Thirlmere Lakes National Parks, plus the Jenolan Caves Karst Conservation Reserve.

Distribution and description  Euphorbia tithymaloides is native to tropical and subtropical North America and Central America. It prefers soil that is sandy, well-drained, and nutrient-rich, particularly with higher concentrations of boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc.Pienaar, The South African \\"What Flower Is That?\\", 2000, p. 253.Neumann, Kumar, and Sopory, Recent Advances in Plant Biotechnology and Its Applications, 2008, p. 354. It is relatively intolerant of high soil salinity levels, but exhibits saline tolerance if well fertilized. The plant tends to be taller and have more biomass if it is well-watered. The plant requires a sunny area to grow in. The shrub can grow to in height and generally is about in width.Millspaugh and Hamet, The Genera \\"Pedilanthus\\" and \\"Cubanthus,\\" and Other American \\"Euphorbiaceae\\", 1913, p. 355. The leaf is a simple angiosperm leaf, arranged oppositely on the stem. Each leaf is sessile (attaching directly to the plant), and about in length. The leaves are glabrous (smooth) and acuminate in shape, with entire (smooth) edges. The veins in the leaves are pinnate. The plant terminates in a dichotomous cyme, with a peduncle supporting each flower. The floral leaves are bifid (split in two parts) and ovate, while the involucral bracts are bright red, irregularly acuminate in shape (e.g., like a slipper), and about in length with a long, thin tube. The flower is void of scent.Strong, The American Flora: Or History of Plants and Wild Flowers, 1850, p. 127. The male pedicel is hairy, while the female is glabrous. The seed pod is about long and wide, and ovoid in shape (with truncated ends). The plant generally flowers in mid-spring.  Taxonomy  There are several recognized subspecies. These include:\\"Euphorbia tithymaloides L.\\" Encyclopedia of Life. 2010. Accessed 2010‚Äì08‚Äì29. * Euphorbia tithymaloides tithymaloides * Euphorbia tithymaloides angustifolia * Euphorbia tithymaloides bahamensis * Euphorbia tithymaloides jamaicensis * Euphorbia tithymaloides padifolia * Euphorbia tithymaloides parasitica * Euphorbia tithymaloides retusa * Euphorbia tithymaloides smallii Subspecies are usually identifiable by their leaves, which come in several types such as laurel-like and variegated and which can be tinged with white or red. = Ring species = In 2012, Cacho and Baum described the first example of a ring species in plants.Cacho & Baum (2012) \\"The Caribbean slipper spurge Euphorbia tithymaloides: the first example of a ring species in plants\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society B They showed that Euphorbia tithymaloides has reproduced and evolved in a ring through Central America and the Caribbean, meeting in the Virgin Islands where they appear to be morphologically and ecologically distinct.  Garden and house use  Euphorbia tithymaloides was introduced as a garden plant prior to 1688.Wijnands, The Botany of the Commelins, 1983, p. 105. The first record of it growing in a garden was in Amsterdam. It is primarily used as an outdoor garden border plant, but certain varieties do well indoors. Because of the plant's toxicity, gardeners are cautioned to wear goggles, gloves, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants.Nellis, Poisonous Plants and Animals of Florida and the Caribbean, 1997, p. 182. Propagation may be by seed or cutting. Cuttings should be made above a joint, be long, and planted in sandy, nutrient-rich soil and allowed to root before planting. Cuttings should be made in March ‚Äì April or June ‚Äì July, and from the middle or top of the main stem.Neumann, Kumar, and Sopory, Recent Advances in Plant Biotechnology and Its Applications, 2008, p. 352. Hummingbirds are attracted to the plant's flowers. Cabbage worms are particularly fond of the plant's leaves. Municipalities have planted Euphorbia tithymaloides in landfills, toxic waste sites, and along roadsides because it is one of the few plants which can thrive in these more difficult environments.  Toxicity  The roots, stems, and leaves of the plant are known to be toxic. These parts of the plant contain euphorbol (a complex terpene) and other diterpene esters. These are also known carcinogens. The plant's leaves and stems also contain beta-sitosterol, cycloartenone, octacosanol, and oxime, all of which have known medicinal as well as toxic properties.Khare, Indian Medicinal Plants: An Illustrated Dictionary, 2007, p. 469. Even minor amounts (a few drops) of the juice of the Euphorbia tithymaloides root can irritate mucosal membranes. When ingested, the irritation of the mucosal membranes of the stomach and intestines will cause nausea and vomiting. Topical application causes skin irritation, inflammation, and even blisters. If introduced topically to the eye, severe pain, keratoconjunctivitis, and reduced visual acuity occur. Ingesting even a few seeds can cause violent and persistent vomiting and extreme diarrhea. If latex or root juice gets on the skin, the victim should immediately wash with soap and warm water. If latex or juice gets in the eye, continuous rinsing with fresh water should be the first course of action. Topical steroids are indicated for skin or eye contact. Intravenous fluids are often administered to counteract the fluid loss due to vomiting and diarrhea.  Medicinal usage  The root is known to be a powerful emetic. A proteolytic enzyme known as pedilanthain can be extracted from the plant's latex, and has been shown in experiments to be effective against intestinal worms and to reduce inflammation when ingested. In 1995, a galactose-specific lectin was purified from the plant's latex, and indications are that it might be useful in combatting diabetes mellitus.Van Damme, Handbook of Plant Lectins: Properties and Biomedical Applications, 1998, p. 211; Nagda and Deshmukh, \\"Hemagglutination Pattern of Galactose Specific Lectin From Pedilanthus tithymaloides in Diabetes Mellitus,\\" Indian Journal of Experimental Biology, 1998, 426-428. In folk medicine, tea has been brewed from the leaves which has been used to treat asthma, persistent coughing, laryngitis, mouth ulcers, and venereal disease. Tea brewed from the root has been used as an abortifacient. The latex has been used topically to treat calluses, ear ache, insect stings, ringworm, skin cancer, toothache, umbilical hernias, and warts. None of these uses has been scientifically verified as effective. In the West Indies, a few drops of the latex is added to milk and used as an emetic.  Other uses  In Peru, the plant is known as \\"cimora misha,\\" \\"timora misha,\\" or \\"planta magica.\\" It is sometimes added to drinks made from mescaline-containing Trichocereus cacti (although Euphorbia tithymaloides has no known psychoactive properties).Anderson, The Cactus Family, 2001, p. 49. The fast-growing nature of the plant, coupled with its ability to grow in relatively toxic soils, had led scientists in India to investigate its usefulness as a \\"petrocrop\\", a plant which could yield biofuel compounds for internal combustion engines.Chandra and Kehri, Biotechnology of \\"Va mycorrhiza\\": Indian Scenario, 2006, p. 268.

Alana Evans (born July 6, 1976) is an American pornographic actress. She is sometimes credited as Jenna Talia (a pun on the word genitalia‚Äîshe hated the alias so much that she changed back to \\"Alana Evans\\" after two films). In 2015, Evans was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame. Early life Evans was born in Fort Campbell, Kentucky and raised in San Jose, California. She has also lived in Sacramento and Los Angeles. Her first job was at a Round Table Pizza parlor. Evans had an appendectomy at age 14. Career Evans and her husband became part owners of their favorite club, which is where she says she lost her remaining inhibitions. She became a stripper and pole dancer and began considering modeling work. Due to a scar from an appendectomy Evans believed that she would not get any magazine work, thus she went into the porn industry at age 21. She entered the adult film industry on March 24, 1998, and did her first scene with Mr. Marcus in the film Real Sex Magazine 11. She initially used the mononym Alana, which was derived from her former husband's name, Alan. She added the last name Evans to her stage name a few years after debuting in porn. Her agent at the time was Reb Sawitz of Pretty Girl International. She signed with the agent Shy Love on May 7, 2012. To date Evans has starred in over 450 films, including numerous Playboy TV projects and 30 softcore movies. She also hosted a segment on KSEX radio called All in the Porn Family until June 2005 as well as hosting a show for Playboy Radio called Private Calls, which airs on the Sirius Satellite Radio Network. She is also the host of the Spice Radio program All Wives Cheat on Sirius XM 103. Never fully satisfied with her bust size, Evans vacillated between the idea of surgical enhancement and accepting her image as a natural starlet. At one point she declared \\"they are going to stay real... I don't want plastic in my body.\\" In late 2007, Evans had her breasts enlarged to DD. She became president of the Adult Performers Actors Guild (APAG), a federally- recognised union, in February 2018, having previously been vice-president before her predecessor Sean Michaels' resignation. Other venturesProduction companies= In September 2006, Alana and Chris Evans created a porn production company called CreamWorks Films. The studio's first film, Pick 'Em Young, featured Alana performing with 18-21 year old new male performers that were recruited through Myspace. Alana focused on producing and casting while Chris focused on directing and editing. In November 2008, Alana and Chris Evans launched another production company, Royalty X Films. The company's first film was Super Pink Holes. =Gaming= On September 20, 2011, Evans and pornographic actress Misti Dawn launched an interactive video gaming website called PwnedByGirls.com, which allows subscribers to play video games with porn stars via Xbox Live or on the PlayStation Network. =Music= In 2012, Evans made her professional singing debut with the song \\"Pop That Tooshie,\\" which is the lead single from the Lords of Acid album Deep Chills. In June 2014, she released a song titled \\"Make You Love Me.\\" =Writing= In February 2014, Evans began writing a column titled \\"The Stoned Gamer\\" for High Times magazine. Personal life Evans had a son at the age of 17. She married pornographic actor Chris Evans in November 1999. On January 16, 2018, she stated on The Today Show that she supported Bernie Sanders during the 2016 election and in February 2020 told The Daily Beast she would be supporting him again for the 2020 election.

This was organized by Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf, Bir Uttom, a decorated veteran of the Bangladesh war of Independence in 1971. Commotion and misinformation spread across the power circles in Dhaka. Mosharraf was seen by many as a supporter of Sheikh Mujibir's government. He put Major General Ziaur Rahman, the Chief of Army Staff and fellow independence War leader, who was not believed to have supported the August coup, under house arrest but did not execute him. Some commentators said that the personal friendship between the two officers led to Mosharraf sparing Rahman's life. =Failed Attempts 1977 to 1980= Led by radical leftist JSD leader Lt. Colonel (Retd.) Abu Taher, disgruntled soldiers of a few local units of Bangladesh Army overthrew the 3-day administration of Khaled Mosharraf. Loyal army units of 2nd Field Artillery regiment to the Army CAS Major General Ziaur Rahman was brought out from house arrest. Loyal soldiers of the army killed Khaled Mosharraf and his associates. News about Mosharraf's affiliation with India aggravated the army and suspicion and mistrust spread abound. Former Army Chief Major General Shafiullah alleged that many JSD (Jatiyo Shomajthantrhik Dol: National Socialist Party) elements infiltrated the army in early 1975. On 6‚Äì7 November 1975 some of the JSD elements distributed leaflets and agitated soldiers against the officer class of the army. JSD members loyal and sympathetic to Indian loyalists tried to prop up and push forward the counter-coup organized by Abu Taher. Army CAS Ziaur Rahman (known as Zia) was reinstated after taken from captivity, who later, in a democratic process, became president of the country. Zia later ordered a judicial trial, to bring back discipline in the barracks. Taher was convicted. He was executed for his part in the coup. The special tribunal was crucial to bring calm to the nation. Ziaur Rahman survived as many as 21 assassination attempts beginning since the war of Independence in 1971. He was killed in the final attempt by army officers on May 30, 1981. Assassination attempts were being conspired by at least one outside nation. Many facts and rumours abounded. From 30 September 1977 till 2 October a series of incidents occurred in an attempt to remove the Zia Administration from power. The incident initiated in the hijacked JAL flight from India that was force landed in Dhaka with 156 passengers as hostages. Jessore and Bogra Cantonment reacted from the disinformation which led to the chaos and commotion resulting from the JAL flt.472 hijacking incident. BAF and BD Army officers were assassinated including many other members. The rebellion was put down and Zia administration was saved. The JAL flight force landed in Dhaka international airport in Tejgaon fully armed with Japanese Red army men who took off from Delhi, India. By 2 October 1977 another revolt erupted, after eleven Air Force officers were murdered by the Red Army men two days before. But they failed in the attempt. Following this, the coup was begun. An estimated 2,500 armed forces personnel were executed following convictions in courts martial for their part in the coup. Officially 1183 soldiers were convicted. 561 were Bangladesh Air Force airmen and rest were Army soldiers. 1982 Coup During his term of power, Zia continued to enjoy overall popularity and public confidence. Supporters of the Awami League and veterans of the independence war continued to undermine his actions. Amidst speculation Zia went on tour to Chittagong on May 29, 1981 to help resolve an intra-party political dispute in the regional Bangladesh National Party. Zia and his entourage stayed overnight at the Chittagong Circuit House, a rest house. In the early hours of the morning of May 30, he was assassinated by a group of army officers, who also killed six of his bodyguards and two aides. Zia's assassination was part of a large conspiracy masterminded by Indian born Lt.General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Manzoor had earlier been a senior army commander and had been transferred to Chittagong. After the assassination of Ziaur Rahman on 30 May 1981, the then Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, started to distance himself from the civilian government in place. He ordered the army to suppress any investigation of Zia's assassination. Ershad did not spare any chance of Major General Abul Manzoor's trial or investigation. Manzoor surrendered and immediately was taken in cantonment. Twelve hours later he was executed. Upon Zia's assassination, Ershad ultimately got rid of a major section of Independence War participants from the army. And buried any traces of evidence that could incriminate him. Zia was buried at the Chandrima Uddan in the locality of Sher-e-Banglanagar in Dhaka. Large processions of the public across the nation along with supporters and BNP activists attended the funeral. Vice President Abdus Sattar immediately succeeded him as the acting president. Presidential Oath Taking Ceremony after 1986 elections, the Chief Justice and Military Secretary (1984-1989) Brigadier ABM Elias is also seen Lieutenant General Ershad expressed loyalty to the new president Abdus Sattar, who led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to victory in elections in 1981. Soon after the BNP government continued with Zia's policies and moved on with the business of governing. Lt. Gen. Ershad waited for the right signals to grab to power. In a bloodless coup on 24 March 1982 Ershad stormed into Bangabhaban and at gunpoint removed President Sattar from office and proclaimed himself Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA), and suspended the constitution. He took over as president on 11 December 1983 by replacing A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury. Attempted Coup in 1996 Lieutenant General Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim staged an abortive coup in 1996 against the Caretaker government. On 19 May 1996, Abdur Rahman Biswas, the President of Bangladesh during a caretaker government, ordered Nasim to force the retirement of two senior army officers. The President believed that they were involved in political activities with opposition parties. Nasim refused to comply. The next day, Biswas sacked him and sent soldiers to control the state radio and television stations. On noon that day, General Nasim ordered soldiers of Bogra, Jessore and Mymensingh divisions to march towards Dhaka. The Ninth Infantry Division's Major General Imamuzzaman, who commanded the division located closest to Dhaka, remained loyal to the President. He directed the removal of all boats and ferries from Jamuna River in Aricha port, so that Bogra and Jessore divisions could not cross the river. He sent a contingent of troops with tanks to blockade the Dhaka-Mymenshing highway. This prevented Mymensing Division Army from entering Dhaka. In the meantime, Major General Mohammad Anwar Hossain, General Officer Commanding of the 33rd Infantry Division located in Comilla, also came to the aid of the president. He mobilized a fully geared 101 Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brig. Shah Ikram (later Maj. Gen.) to Dhaka to fortify Bangabhaban, the presidential palace. The 33rd Division was deployed, using an Infantry Battalion and a company of tanks from the 7th Horse Armoured Battalion at the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, to create a blockade against the 24th Infantry Division located in Chittagong. The government broadcast announcements asking all soldiers to stay at their own cantonment. After some hours, Mymensing Division soldiers returned to their barracks. The Chittagong Division never mobilized towards Dhaka. The General Officer Commanding of the Chittagong Division realized that the military coup was highly unlikely to succeed. That night Nasim was interviewed by the BBC and, in reference to troop movements, he said that as Army Chief, he could move troops any time he wanted. Nasim was arrested by the Brigade Commander of 14 Independent Engineers Brigade and put under house arrest in the Army Mess behind Army Central Library, Staff road, Dhaka Cantonment. Later Awami League government, which was elected to power in 1996, granted him a formal retirement. Since then he has remained a private citizen. Coup against Caretaker government in 2007 Army Chief Lt. Gen Moeen U. Ahmed staged a military coup on 11 January 2007 in Bangladesh. The military- backed Caretaker Government (CTG) was formed outside the constitutional provisions. Fakhruddin Ahmed made head the government. President Iajuddin Ahmed had to run the presidency at gun point during said army rule.[14] [15] Lt. Gen. Moeen upgraded the Army Chief of Staff's rank to General.[16] Moeen extended the rule of the CTG for two years while his tenure for one year as army chief without lawful authority, in the absence of regular elected government following receiving NDC being the Lt. General and army chief which is designed for Lt. Colonel level officer. The coup has ended as of in 2008 after the military government held a parliamentary election in December 2008 and transfer of power was handed over to the Awami League, who won 230 seats in parliament.

In recent years it played mostly in Russian Professional Football League, the third league in the national hierarchy. Due to severe financial difficulties, Dynamo missed the opportunity to be promoted to the First Division in 2005. After that, it was formally liquidated two times and resurrected again as an amateur team, eventually redeeming the professional status. As of the season 2013-14, the team played in the amateur championship of Stavropol krai under the name Dynamo UOR. A separate club was renamed FC Dynamo GTS Stavropol for the 2014-15 season in the Russian Professional Football League. Before the 2015‚Äì16 season, FC Dynamo GTS was renamed FC Dynamo Stavropol. History The club's most significant victory was achieved in 1949, when it earned the title of Champion of Russia. From 1957 to 2004, Dynamo played in various leagues of the Soviet Union and Russia. In 1957, it was called FC Trudovye Rezervy Stavropol and from 1958 to 1961 it was called FC Spartak Stavropol. In 1980‚Äì1981 and 1985‚Äì1991, Dynamo played in the USSR First League.

He is currently a professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago and founder and director of the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST). Career Pape graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1982 from the University of Pittsburgh,http://political- science.uchicago.edu/faculty/pape.shtml where he was a Harry S. Truman Scholar majoring in political science. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1988 in the same field. He taught international relations at Dartmouth College from 1994 to 1999 and at the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Airpower Studies from 1991 to 1994. Since 1999, he has taught at the University of Chicago, where he is now tenured. Pape has been the director of the graduate studies department of political science as well as the chair of the Committee on International Relations at the University of Chicago. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Pape served as an adviser to both Republican Ron Paul and Democrat Barack Obama.Weiss, Philip (2008-05-05) Mr. Zbig, The American Conservative =CPOST= After presenting preliminary data on his research into suicide terrorism in the American Political Science Review in 2003, Pape founded the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (originally, Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism), which he directs. The project is funded by the Carnegie Corporation, the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the University of Chicago, and the Argonne National Laboratory.\\"A Scholarly Look at Terror Sees Bootprints In the Sand\\" by Caryle Murphy Washington Post, July 10, 2005; D01 In December 2009, Security Studies published an issue on terrorism featuring content exclusively from CPOST. PublicationsBombing to Win= Pape published his first full-length book in 1996, Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War, where he questions the conventional wisdom that coercive air power is both effective and relatively cheap. Rather than coercing citizens of the bombed nation to rise up against their government, coercive air power often backfires, resulting in a citizenry that is both surprisingly resilient and loyal to their government. Pape also argues that air power and land power should be integrated and used together in a \\"hammer and anvil\\" fashion. A 1999 RAND report funded by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) \\"explored the role of air power as a coercive instrument\\", attempting to rebut Pape's claim.Byman, Waxman, and Larson (1999) They concluded that, \\"Although the United States and the USAF have scored some notable successes, the record is mixed.\\"Byman, Waxman, and Larson (1999, p. iii, 5/195) Horowitz and Reiter applied \\"multivariate probit analysis [to] all instances of air power coercion from 1917 to 1999\\". Their quantitative analyses essentially matched Pape's qualitative assessment that attacking military targets has improved the chances of success, but \\"higher levels of civilian vulnerability have no effect on the chances of coercion success\\". =Dying to Win= Pape's Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism (2005) contradicts many widely held beliefs about suicide terrorism. Pape argues that there is \\"little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any one of the world's religions... Rather, what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common is a specific secular and strategic goal: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland\\" (p. 4). Pape also presents evidence that the majority of suicide terrorists do not come from impoverished or uneducated backgrounds, but rather have middle class origins and a significant level of education. In a criticism of Pape's link between occupation and suicide terrorism, an article titled \\"Design, Inference, and the Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism\\" (published in The American Political Science Review), authors Scott Ashworth, Joshua D. Clinton, Adam Meirowitz, and Kristopher W. Ramsay from Princeton charged Pape with \\"sampling on the dependent variable\\" by limiting research only to cases in which suicide terror was used.American Political Science Review , Volume 102, Issue 02, May 2008, pp 269-273. Similar criticisms were made by Michael C. Horowitz, who concludes the presence of a occupying power is not a statistically significant indicator of likelihood to incite suicide terrorism. In response, Pape argues that his research design is sufficient because it collected the universe of known cases of suicide terrorism.American Political Science Review , Volume 102, Issue 02, May 2008, pp 275-277. In a rejoinder, Ashworth et al. discuss how even large samples of the dependent variable cannot be used to explain variation in outcomes, why suicide terrorism in some places but not others, if the sample does not vary.Design, Inference, and the Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism: A Rejoinder, Draft Manuscript, https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/rejoinder3.pdf Assaf Moghadam has also criticized Pape's conclusions. =Cutting the Fuse= Pape's Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It is co-authored with James K. Feldman, was published in 2010. Cutting the Fuse evaluates more than 2100 suicide attacks (6 times the number evaluated in Dying to Win) in an attempt to identify key factors that explain the ebb and flow of suicide terrorist campaigns. The book recommends that nations to avoid stationing troops where they will be perceived as occupiers threatening local culture and institutions or coercing the government of an occupied state to do things that would be perceived as benefiting the occupiers at the expense of the local population. When occupation is necessary, minimize the threat to local culture by helping local officials to do things they might otherwise want to do but didn't previously have the ability and by treating collateral damage with great sensitivity.Robert Pape and James K. Feldman, Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It. University of Chicago Press, 2010. pp. 330-33. =Work on economic sanctions= In 1997 and 1998, Pape published two articles examining the efficacy of economic sanctions.International Security, Volume 22, Issue 2, Fall 1997, pp 90-136. Pape contests the validity of international economic sanctions in achieving policy goals, judging that only 5% can legitimately be considered successes, as opposed to 34% claimed in the work of other scholars. One of these scholars, Kimberly Ann Elliot, responded to Pape's initial piece, suggesting that Pape had mischaracterized the data, and that his views on economic sanctions and Elliot's views on economic sanctions were \\"not terribly different.\\" Pape's response, in the same issue of 'International Security', insisted that he had not mischaracterized the data, and that his view of economic sanctions is meaningfully different from the picture put forth by Elliot and others.

Stewart. Overview Den of Thieves recounts the insider trading scandals involving Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken, and other Wall Street financiers in the United States during the 1980s, such as Robert Freeman, Dennis Levine, Lowell Milken, John A. Mulheren, Martin Siegel, Timothy Tabor, Richard Wigton, Robert Wilkis, and others. There have been eight editions as of 2008. Intertwining the stories of financiers, bankers, lawyers, and the law enforcement officials who pursued them, Den of Thieves tells a tale of arrogance and complacency amongst the Wall Street elite. As leveraged buyouts and takeovers proliferated in the heady 1980s, information on which companies were being targeted became ever more valuable. The stock price of companies could rise enormously on rumors of a potential takeover. Those who were privy to that information before it became public could make huge sums of money. Stewart shows how some of the biggest names in American financial history were involved in one of the greatest insider-trading schemes ever and how their exposure and punishment sent shock waves through corporate America.

The priory was of the Gilbertine Order, a religious order formed by Gilbert of Sempringham (c. 1083-1189). It was only one of ten religious houses in England that housed both nuns and canons.Chicksands Priory Bedfordshire Libraries By 1200 it was one of the largest and wealthiest Gilbertine houses.Binns, A. Dedications of Monastic Houses in England and Wales, 1066-1216 (1989), 173. Fleeing the wrath of King Henry II after the Council of Northampton in 1164, Archbishop Thomas Becket is said to have spent a short time at Chicksands Priory on his way out of England.Graham, R. St. Gilbert of Sempringham and the Gilbertines (1901), 18. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the sixteenth century, the priory passed to the Snowe family and then in 1576 to the Osborne family, who owned it for almost 400 years. Chicksands was the residence of the famous letter-writer Dorothy Osborne between her birth in 1627 and her marriage in 1654. Elements of the original building remain, but it has been altered over the years, not least in 1740 by the architect Isaac Ware and in 1813 by James Wyatt, who designed the entrance hall, staircase and porch in the Gothic Revival style.Parishmouse Sir George Osborne's collection of \\"antiquities, old glass and great paintings\\" are mentioned \\"in his home at Chicksands Priory\\" by Arthur Mee in his 1939 volume on Huntingdon and Bedfordshire. The Crown Commissioners bought the Chicksands Priory estate on 15 April 1936, later renting it to Gerald Bagshawe, who lived there until it was requisitioned by the Royal Navy. In 1940, after a few months of naval occupation, the RAF followed and it became known, firstly, as RAF Chicksands Priory. In 1950 the United States Air Force took over and continued on the site as a \\"listening post\\" until September 1995. Chicksands Priory is a Grade I listed building.British Listed Buildings The group \\"Friends of Chicksands Priory\\" was established in 1975 and tours of the building were offered to the general public until the summer of 1996. They returned to reopen the priory, following intense restoration during 1997 and 1998, in the spring of 1999.History of the Friends of Chicksands Priory There were reports, at the time that the USAF pulled out of the base, in the local press (\\"The Comet\\") and local radio (BBC Three Counties Radio) that some of the departing personnel were taking \\"souvenirs\\" from the old buildings, causing damage and loss. Neither the US nor the British authorities would confirm this.The Comet In 2001 the Channel 4 television programme Time Team excavated sections of the site, uncovering part of what was believed to be the Infirmary cloister and several graves, and revealing possible details of the ground plan. The programme suggested that the Nuns' cloister lay under what is today a cobbled courtyard.Timeteam Saturday, 27 December 2008 Burials Burials at the priory included Rohese de Vere, Countess of Essex.John Leland, Itinerary vol. 5, 150 ReferencesSee also * List of monastic houses in Bedfordshire ;Images * * Priory Entrance Hallway * Chicksands Priory ;Other * The Ghost at Chicksands Priory - Investigation report Category:Grade I listed buildings in Bedfordshire Category:Country houses in Bedfordshire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Monasteries in Bedfordshire Category:1150s establishments in England Category:Christian monasteries established in the 12th century Category:Gilbertine monasteries ","title":"Chicksands Priory"},{"id":"2476268","text":"Pascal Gabriel (born 15 December 1956) is a Belgian-born musician based in London, England and Paris, France.  Background  Pascal Gabriel's musical career began in 1977 in the punk rock band The Razors (bass guitar). He left Belgium for London in 1979. During the early 1980s, he had spells in various experimental groups, including art-school band Church of Friendly Valley with scratch video artist George Barber, and an electronic project whose only performance was in a supermarket. He formed a duo with guitarist Danny Kustow, as well as touring as a percussionist with the Tom Robinson Band, before starting to pick up work as a freelance sound engineer in various London studios, earning a reputation for innovative remixes for artists such as Marc Almond (Soft Cell) and Yello. In 1983 he had his first release, with two experimental tracks on the Touch cassette T2 Meridians One, alongside future collaborator Simon Fisher Turner, before beginning to concentrate on studio work. Toward the end of the 1980s, Gabriel was producer and co-writer for S'Express and Bomb the Bass ‚Äî two of the first sample-heavy dancefloor artists of that era. He claimed a number one UK single with the S'Express track \\"Theme from S'Express\\" and a number two with Bomb the Bass' \\"Beat Dis.\\" Following the success of S'Express and Bomb the Bass, Gabriel embarked on a series of projects, mixing, producing and writing with a variety of artists, including Claudia Br√ºcken (formerly of Propaganda), Wire, and Debbie Harry from Blondie. In the 1990s, he moved into indie and pop music, collaborating with EMF, Inspiral Carpets, Kitchens of Distinction, Billy Mackenzie and Siouxsie Sioux's second group The Creatures. From 1996 to 1998 he wrote, produced and performed with the Mute Records-signed band Peach (known as \\"Peach Union\\" in the U.S.). Their song \\"On My Own\\" was featured prominently in the film Sliding Doors. Gabriel subsequently wrote and produced with a host of popular artists, including the then unsigned singer Dido (with whom he wrote several songs: \\"I'm No Angel\\" and \\"Here with Me\\" from her multi-million selling debut album No Angel), Kylie Minogue (including \\"Your Love\\" for her album Fever), Dot Allison, Natalie Imbruglia, Rachel Stevens, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Skye Edwards (Morcheeba), Bebel Gilberto and many others. He collaborated extensively with Miss Kittin, co-writing and producing her solo album BatBox, and with New Zealand star Ladyhawke, penning and producing five tracks on her debut album, Ladyhawke (including the singles \\"My Delirium\\", \\"Dusk Till Dawn\\", and \\"Magic\\") and the whole of her second album Anxiety, which he also mixed, in 2012. Around the same time he co-wrote \\"Tune Into My Heart\\" on Little Boots' d√©but album Hands, carried out additional production on Goldfrapp's fifth album, Head First, and co-wrote and produced three tracks on Marina and the Diamonds 2010 album The Family Jewels, and the song \\"Can't Beat the Feeling\\" on Kylie Minogue's 2010 UK number one Aphrodite album. He co-wrote several tracks with Will Young for his 2011 UK number one album Echoes, including the single \\"Losing Myself\\", recorded in his studios in London and France, and co-wrote the single \\"The Apple\\" with VV Brown. After writing several tracks with The Temper Trap for their Thick as Thieves album in 2015, he produced Australian songstress Emma Louise's 2016 album Supercry. In 2018, Gabriel developed a solo project, 'Stubbleman'. A return to his electronic and ambient roots, it combines a cinematic mixture of found sounds and field recordings with modular synthesizers and live piano. Stubbleman's debut album, Mountains and Plains, inspired by a road trip across the US, was released on Marc Hollander's cult Belgian indie label Crammed Discs in April 2019, to positive reviews in the UK, and internationally. His live shows in November at the From the Source festival at Warwick Arts Centre and the Purcell Room in London's SouthBank Centre, as part of the EFJ London Jazz Festival, involved extensive use of self-made automatons: glockenspiels, vibraphones and xylophones. On 5 June 2020, he released an EP, The Blackbird Tapes, on Crammed Discs, inspired by birdsong during the Coronavirus lockdown in London during spring 2020.

Biography  Vasile P√¢rvan came from a modest family, being the first child of the teacher Andrei P√¢rvan (with advanced settlers in Bessarabia) and of Aristi»õa Chiriac (from Dobrenii Neam»õului). He received the first name Vasile, as well as his uncle, Vasile Conta (his mother being the philosopher's cousin). In 1913 he married Silvia Cristescu, niece of Ioan Bogdan, his former teacher. During the First World War he took refuge in Ia»ôi (in 1916) and then in Odessa (in 1917) where his wife died, at the birth of the child. Passionate about the work on site, Vasile P√¢rvan ignored the appendicitis he suffered from. He finally arrived on the operating table, but it was too late to save his life; he died at 45 years old only, in full creative power. = Education = He attended primary education in Bere»ôti and high school studies at the Gheorghe Ro»ôca Codreanu National College in B√¢rlad (1893-1900). He then studied at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the University of Bucharest (1900-1904), having as professors Nicolae Iorga, Ioan Bogdan and Dimitrie Onciul. In 1904 he left with a scholarship from the University of Bucharest (from the \\"Hillel Fund\\") on a troubled study trip to Germany,Vasile P√¢rvan »ôi periplul german, Zargidava - RevistƒÉ de istorie, VII (2008) 19-27 following the courses of three universities (Jena, Berlin and Breslau) and often having financial problems and health issues.

Sport-Turism, 1983. with the work The nationality of merchants in the Roman Empire (1908, in German), considered by specialists as one of the best studies on the development of trade in classical antiquity. German colleagues called him \\"the little Mommsen\\", which - given that the \\"great\\" Theodor Mommsen had recently been awarded (in 1902) the Nobel Prize for his monumental History of Ancient Rome - suggested the research interests of Vasile P√¢rvan. He became professor at the University of Bucharest, and was elected member of the Romanian Academy.  Professional activity  Publishing activity = In 1900 he made his debut in journalism at the \\"Noua revistƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ\\". From 1902 he started collaborating with \\"Convorbiri Literare\\" and in the following year with \\"Voin»õa na»õionalƒÉ\\", \\"Tribuna Poporului\\", \\"LuceafƒÉrul\\" etc. In 1906 he joined as a \\"soldier of the right cause\\" in the Brotherhood of the Good Romanians (FrƒÉ»õia Bunilor Rom√¢ni) (organization created by Nicolae Iorga), starting to write for \\"SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul\\" and \\"Neamul Rom√¢nesc\\".

He has also been a member of several academies and scientific societies abroad; among others, he was an associate professor at the Sorbonne (since 1926) and a member of the International Committee of Historical Sciences (Geneva). In order to solve the problems related to the history of Dacia, he organized a series of systematic excavations, especially in the archeological resorts from the second Iron Age. Based on the partial results of the excavations, Getica (1926) wrote ‚Äì his most important work ‚Äì a vast historical-archaeological synthesis, through which he brought to the forefront of historical research the political and cultural role of the Dacians; some shortcomings and exaggerations (including the emphasis on the role of the Scythians and Celts in the development of Geto-Dacian culture) do not detract from the value of this work.Emil Condurachi, L'archeologie roumaine au XX\\" siecle, Editura Academiei R.S.R., Bucure»ôti, 1963; Un grand archeologue et historien roumain de l'antiquite: Vasile P√¢rvan (1882-1927), √Æn \\"Revue Roumaine d'Histoire\\", nr. 2/1965, p. 183-205 A map of the Romanian coast in the Roman period, N.

He led the archeological site of Histria until 1926. Of the 12 years as Vasile P√¢rvan ‚Äì was a director of the National Museum of Antiquities ‚Äì when he led the archaeological excavations in Histria, only nine years (1914‚Äì1916; 1921 ‚Äì1926) normal campaigns took place. The relatively small proportions of his work are explained by: * the intense organizational activity of this headmaster, * the aridity and lack of information of the areas on which he focused his activity. Mircea Gheorghe notes: :\\" Getica was part of a projected trilogy that the great scientist failed to finish. This was to be followed by another work, Roman Dacia and then a third, Protohistory of the Slavs. Posthumously, the unfinished work Dacia. The ancient civilizations from the Carpatho-Danubian regions, which would have been part of the trilogy, if Vasile P√¢rvan had had time to develop it. [...] The fundamental objective of the trilogy was the analysis of the process of formation of the Romanian people through the Daco-Roman synthesis and through the assimilation of the Slavs and other allogens facing a strong rural Romanianness. His thesis was clear: the Romans took root through their agricultural occupations and formed a strong community, which the coming of other nations could not join\\". His conception was that the only real object of history is culture, the spiritual life, the other aspects of life being useful insofar as it helps to understand the evolution of the human spirit. Through his idealistic historical conception, exposed in the sociological study The Fundamental Ideas of Contemporary Social Culture and in essays (volumes of Ideas and Historical Forms and Memorials) he managed to make a synthesis of neohegelianism and Neo-Kantianism and declared himself an opponent of chauvinism and cosmopolitanism.

Lizard Mound County Park is a county-operated park in the Town of Farmington, Washington County, Wisconsin near the city of West Bend. Established in 1950, it was acquired by Washington County from the state of Wisconsin in 1986. It contains a significant well-preserved effigy mound group. Mounds in the park are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, identified as \\"47Wt1\\". Also included in the listing are the Glass Mounds, identified as 47Wt199. Information Lizard Mound County Park is located in the Town of Farmington, north of West Bend, Wisconsin on County Trunk \\"A\\", one mile east of State Highway 144. Established in 1950, the park was acquired by Washington County from the State of Wisconsin in 1986. The park contains 28 effigy mounds in an excellent state of preservation, reputedly one of the best effigy mound groups remaining in Wisconsin. A self-guided anthropological nature trail winds around the park. Trail markers reveal information about the extinct culture that built the mounds. An unusually beautiful group of mounds, each is of prominent height and careful construction. Most of the mounds rise more than three feet above the ground surface. The variety of mound shapes found in the park is considered unusual. Two are large bird effigy mounds and seven are long-tailed animal forms. These long-tailed effigies are usually referred to as \\"panther\\" effigies. One of the 28 mounds is named \\"Lizard Mound\\". This mound might have been intended to represent the same animal, whether a panther or something else, but in a spread eagle posture that shows all four limbs. History The Mound Builders lived in Wisconsin and bordering states between A.D. 500 and A.D. 1000. They survived by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants. They moved from place to place often. In the summer they could be found closer to rivers and lakes, while in the winter they moved into sheltered upland valleys. They built burial and effigy mounds shaped like mammals, reptiles, birds and other creatures, both real and mythical. They also constructed conical, oval and linear mounds. The effigy mound builders usually buried their dead in small pits or laid them on carefully prepared surfaces. The mounds were then built over them like grave markers. The custom of building effigy burial mounds died out about 1000 years ago; it was a custom unique to the general area. Little else is known about the Mound Builders. Even Indians who lived in Wisconsin when the first white men arrived didn't know why, or by whom, the mounds had been built. The earliest data concerning the mounds in the area of Lizard Mound County Park was in the form of a sketch map resulting from field investigations made by Professor Julius L. Torney of Milwaukee in 1883. In his sketch of the mound group, Torney illustrated a total of 47 Indian mounds. He also indicated that a number of the earthworks had been destroyed prior to the time that he drew his map. The original group probably consisted of at least 60 mounds, including many of the well known effigy shapes. Archeological explorations conducted in 1960 revealed that the dead were placed in pits, with the effigy mounds built over the pits. Artifacts such as clay pots, projectile points, pipes, bone harpoons and beads were sometimes placed with the dead. It has been speculated that the shapes of the mounds had a religious or clan significance, but no one knows for sure. Excavations of Effigy Mound Builders' village sites indicated they lived in small nomadic groups, hunted, fished, gathered fruits and nuts, fashioned tools of stone, wood, bone and copper, made pottery and may have been the first people in Wisconsin to use the bow and arrow. No other group of mounds in Wisconsin is so well preserved, so diverse in form, or exhibits such outstanding examples of the prehistoric art of mound construction.

Equivalently it is the minimum number of spanning forests needed to cover all the edges of the graph. The Nash-Williams theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for when a graph is k-arboric. Example A partition of the complete bipartite graph K4,4 into three forests, showing that it has arboricity three. The figure shows the complete bipartite graph K4,4, with the colors indicating a partition of its edges into three forests. K4,4 cannot be partitioned into fewer forests, because any forest on its eight vertices has at most seven edges, while the overall graph has sixteen edges, more than double the number of edges in a single forest. Therefore, the arboricity of K4,4 is three. Arboricity as a measure of density The arboricity of a graph is a measure of how dense the graph is: graphs with many edges have high arboricity, and graphs with high arboricity must have a dense subgraph. In more detail, as any n-vertex forest has at most n-1 edges, the arboricity of a graph with n vertices and m edges is at least \\\\lceil m/(n-1)\\\\rceil. Additionally, the subgraphs of any graph cannot have arboricity larger than the graph itself, or equivalently the arboricity of a graph must be at least the maximum arboricity of any of its subgraphs. Nash-Williams proved that these two facts can be combined to characterize arboricity: if we let nS and mS denote the number of vertices and edges, respectively, of any subgraph S of the given graph, then the arboricity of the graph equals \\\\max_S\\\\\\\\{\\\\lceil m_S/(n_S-1)\\\\rceil\\\\\\\\}. Any planar graph with n vertices has at most 3n-6 edges, from which it follows by Nash- Williams' formula that planar graphs have arboricity at most three. Schnyder used a special decomposition of a planar graph into three forests called a Schnyder wood to find a straight-line embedding of any planar graph into a grid of small area. Algorithms The arboricity of a graph can be expressed as a special case of a more general matroid partitioning problem, in which one wishes to express a set of elements of a matroid as a union of a small number of independent sets. As a consequence, the arboricity can be calculated by a polynomial-time algorithm .  Related concepts  The anarboricity of a graph is the maximum number of edge-disjoint nonacyclic subgraphs into which the edges of the graph can be partitioned. The star arboricity of a graph is the size of the minimum forest, each tree of which is a star (tree with at most one non-leaf node), into which the edges of the graph can be partitioned. If a tree is not a star itself, its star arboricity is two, as can be seen by partitioning the edges into two subsets at odd and even distances from the tree root respectively. Therefore, the star arboricity of any graph is at least equal to the arboricity, and at most equal to twice the arboricity. The linear arboricity of a graph is the minimum number of linear forests (a collection of paths) into which the edges of the graph can be partitioned. The linear arboricity of a graph is closely related to its maximum degree and its slope number. The pseudoarboricity of a graph is the minimum number of pseudoforests into which its edges can be partitioned. Equivalently, it is the maximum ratio of edges to vertices in any subgraph of the graph, rounded up to an integer. As with the arboricity, the pseudoarboricity has a matroid structure allowing it to be computed efficiently . The thickness of a graph is the minimum number of planar subgraphs into which its edges can be partitioned. As any planar graph has arboricity three, the thickness of any graph is at least equal to a third of the arboricity, and at most equal to the arboricity. The degeneracy of a graph is the maximum, over all induced subgraphs of the graph, of the minimum degree of a vertex in the subgraph. The degeneracy of a graph with arboricity a is at least equal to a, and at most equal to 2a-1. The coloring number of a graph, also known as its Szekeres-Wilf number is always equal to its degeneracy plus 1 . The strength of a graph is a fractional value whose integer part gives the maximum number of disjoint spanning trees that can be drawn in a graph. It is the packing problem that is dual to the covering problem raised by the arboricity. The two parameters have been studied together by Tutte and Nash-Williams. The fractional arboricity is a refinement of the arboricity, as it is defined for a graph G as \\\\max\\\\\\\\{m_S/(n_S-1) \\\\mid S \\\\subseteq G\\\\\\\\}. In other terms, the arboricity of a graph is the ceiling of the fractional arboricity. The (a,b)-decomposability generalizes the arboricity. A graph is (a,b)-decomposable if its edges can be partitioned into a+1 sets, each one of them inducing a forest, except one who induces a graph with maximum degree b. A graph with arboricity a is (a,0)-decomposable. The tree number is the minimal number of trees covering the edges of a graph.  Special appearances  Arboricity appears in the Goldberg‚ÄìSeymour conjecture.

Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome affects an estimated between 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 25,000 individuals. It is a microdeletion syndrome characterized by an abnormality in the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 and is sometimes called the 17p- syndrome. Signs and symptoms Facial features of children with Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome include a broad and square face, deep-set eyes, large cheeks, and a prominent jaw, as well as a flat nose bridge (in the young child; as the child ages it becomes more ski-jump shaped). Eyes tend to be deep-set and appear close together there is also a slant upwards. Eyebrows are heavy with lateral extension. The mouth is the most noticeable feature, both upper and lower lips are full, the mouth is wide. The mouth curves downwards and the upper lip curves outwards, due to a fleshy philtrum. These facial features become more noticeable as the individual ages, as Mandible growth outstrips that of the maxilla leading to a clear midface hypoplasia. There is also a mild brachycephaly. Disrupted sleep patterns are characteristic of Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome, typically beginning early in life. Affected people may be very sleepy during the day, but have trouble falling asleep and awaken several times each night, due to an inverted circadian rhythm of melatonin. People with Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome have engaging personalities, but all also have a lot of behavioral problems. These behavioral problems include frequent temper tantrums, meltdowns and outbursts, aggression, anger, fidgeting, compulsive behavior, anxiety, impulsiveness, and difficulty paying attention. Self-harm, including biting, hitting, head banging, and skin picking, is very common. Repetitive self-hugging is a behavioral trait that may be unique to Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome. People with this condition may also compulsively lick their fingers and flip pages of books and magazines (a behavior known as \\"lick and flip\\"), as well as possessing an impressive ability to recall a wide range of small details about people or subject-specific trivia. Other symptoms can include short stature, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), reduced sensitivity to pain and temperature, and a hoarse voice. Some people with this disorder have ear abnormalities that lead to hearing loss. Affected individuals may have eye abnormalities that cause nearsightedness (myopia), strabismus, and other problems with vision. Heart and kidney defects also have been reported in people with Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome, though they are less common. Genetics Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome is a chromosomal condition related to low copy repeats of specific segments of chromosome 17. Most people with SMS have a deletion of genetic material from a specific region of chromosome 17 (17p11.2). Although this region contains multiple genes, recently researchers discovered that the loss of one particular gene the retinoic acid induced 1 or RAI1 is responsible for most of the characteristic features of this condition. Also, other genes within the chromosome 17 contribute to the variability and severity of the clinical features. The loss of other genes in the deleted region may help explain why the features of Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome vary among affected individuals. A small percentage of people with Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome have a mutation in the RAI1 gene instead of a chromosomal deletion. These deletions and mutations lead to the production of an abnormal or nonfunctional version of the RAI1 protein. RAI1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes, including several that are involved in controlling circadian rhythm, such as CLOCK. The groups led by James Lupski (Baylor College of Medicine) and Sarah Elsea (Virginia Commonwealth University) are in the process of studying the exact function of this gene in relation to Smith Magenis Syndrome.Lupski, James Richard. Exploring the Reversibilty of the Smith-Magenis Syndrome PhenotypeBuilding bridges of hope: taking stock of the Smith-Magenis Syndrome SMS is typically not inherited. This condition usually results from a genetic change that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. People with Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome most often have no history of the condition in their family. Diagnosis SMS is usually confirmed by blood tests called chromosome (cytogenetic) analysis and utilize a technique called FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization). The characteristic micro-deletion was sometimes overlooked in a standard FISH test, leading to a number of people with the symptoms of SMS with negative results. The recent development of the FISH for 17p11.2 deletion test has allowed more accurate detection of this deletion. However, further testing is required for variations of Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome that are caused by a mutation of the RAI1 gene as opposed to a deletion. Children with SMS are often given psychiatric diagnoses such as autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit disorder (ADD) and/or mood disorders. Treatment Treatment for Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome relies on managing its symptoms. Children with SMS often require several forms of support, including physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Support is often required throughout an affected person's lifetime. Medication is often used to address some symptoms. Melatonin supplements and trazodone are commonly used to regulate sleep disturbances. In combination with exogenous melatonin, blockade of endogenous melatonin production during the day by the adrenergic antagonist acebutolol can increase concentration, improve sleep and sleep timing and aid in improvement of behaviour. Other medications (such as risperdal) are sometimes used to regulate violent behavior. Eponym The eponym Smith‚ÄìMagenis refers to two scientists who described the condition in 1986, namely, Ann C. M. Smith, a genetic counselor at the National Institutes of Health, and R. Ellen Magenis, a pediatrician, medical geneticist and cytogeneticist at the Oregon Health Sciences University.

It is a fictional sequel to the initially true story of the 1971 Academy Award winning picture The French Connection. The film expands on the central character of Det. Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle who travels to Marseille, France where he is attempting to track down French drug-dealer Alain Charnier, who escaped at the end of the first film. Hackman won an Academy Award for Best Actor for the original The French Connection and he and Fernando Rey are the only returning cast members. Plot Picking up two or three years after the original left off, narcotics officer Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) is still searching for elusive drug kingpin Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey). Orders from his superiors send Doyle to Marseille, France, to track down the criminal mastermind and bust his drug ring. Once in France, Doyle is met by English-speaking Inspector Henri Barth√©l√©my (Bernard Fresson), who resents his rude and crude crimefighting demeanor. Doyle then begins to find himself as a fish out of water in France, where he is matched with a language he cannot understand. Doyle is shown round the police station where he finds his desk is situated directly outside the toilets. He tells Barth√©l√©my that he is not satisfied with this positioning and hopes it is not a joke at his expense. Barth√©l√©my informs Doyle that he has read his personnel file and is aware of his reputation and especially hopes he has not brought a gun with him as it is strictly forbidden in France for visiting police officers from other countries to carry firearms. Doyle continues to struggle with the language and tries to order drinks in a bar. He eventually makes himself understood, befriending a bartender while buying him drinks and they eventually stumble out of the bar together at closing time, followed by two men. The next day, while Doyle is watching a beach volleyball match, Charnier sees him from a restaurant below. Determined to find Charnier on his own, Popeye escapes from what are in fact French police escorts keeping watch on him in case Charnier would get him: Doyle doesn't understand that he is being used as a bait by French police... The same night Charnier sends his men to capture Doyle, killing one of his watchers in the process, and take him to a secluded, seedy hotel in the old quarter for interrogation. For several weeks, Doyle is injected with heroin in effort to force him into capitulation. Scenes of his growing addiction follow, including one in which an elderly lady (Cathleen Nesbitt) visits him in his befuddled state. She talks to him, declaring herself to be English, and saying that her son is \\"just like\\" him, while stroking his arm. Initially she seems compassionate to his plight, but a change in the camera angle reveals her 'track' marks. The gentle old lady steals his watch. Meanwhile, Barth√©l√©my has sent police everywhere to search for Doyle. Charnier interrogates a needy Doyle about what he knows, but Doyle says he was sent here just because he is the only one who can recognize him. Charnier believes Doyle, so lets him go after one massive injection. Doyle is dumped barely alive but addicted in front of police headquarters. Gruelling scenes of resuscitation and drug withdrawal follow. In his effort to save both Doyle's life and his reputation, Barth√©l√©my immediately quarantines Doyle in the police cells and begins his cold turkey withdrawal from the heroin. Supervising his recovery, and at his side with both emotional support and taunts questioning his toughness, Barth√©l√©my ensures Doyle completes the cycle of physical withdrawal. When he is well enough to be on his feet, Doyle starts back on the road to regaining his physical fitness. He searches Marseille and, finding the hideout he was brought to, sets it on fire. He breaks into a room at the hotel and finds Charnier's henchmen, whom he pursues and interrogates as to the whereabouts of Charnier. A delivery of opium is taking place at the harbour for a future production due. Doyle, Barth√©l√©my and other inspectors rush to the boat that is being unloaded and engage Charnier's henchmen in a gun battle in a dry dock. The thugs open the spillways, water starts rushing in, Doyle and Barth√©l√©my are trapped. The henchmen and an inspector are killed, Doyle rescues Barth√©l√©my. French police hold Doyle responsible for the inspector's death and want to send him home. But Doyle believes that the deal is not done and convinces Barth√©l√©my, who \\"owes him one\\" to keep watch over the ship. They eventually spot the ship's captain on his way to meet Charnier's lieutenant, whom Doyle recognizes. A tailing ensues taking the police to the drug warehouse, which they raid, but are met with a barrage of fire. Doyle picks up a gun and kills a gangster machine-gunning them. Charnier's lieutenant and other men escape with the drug load on board a van, but Barth√©l√©my closes the warehouse door and stops them. But once again Charnier has escaped. Doyle, in a foot chase of Charnier, who is sailing out of the harbor on his yacht, catches up with the boat at the end of the pier, takes his gun out of his holster, calls Charnier's name, and in the last seconds of the movie shoots him dead. CastProduction John Frankenheimer had lived in France for a number of years when he agreed to make the film: > I like the script, I like the characters, I like the Hackman character in > France and not speaking a word of French. It's a very difficult film because > we want in no way to rip off the first one, which is one of the best films > I've ever seen. I want to make a movie that stands on its own as a movie. Frankenheimer also admitted he made the film in part because of the financial failure of The Impossible Object. \\"I want to make pictures that one sees\\", he said. \\"There's a great public out there and you have to reach them; otherwise you're not in the movie business.\\" Score The music was composed and conducted by Don Ellis, who returned from the original film. A soundtrack CD was released by the Film Score Monthly in 2005 and paired with the music from the first film. Reception On release, French Connection II attracted positive reactions from the press and fared well at the box office. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 76% based on 25 reviews, and a rating average of 6.51/10. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two and a half out of four stars and said that \\"if Frankenheimer and his screenplay don't do justice to the character (of Det. Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle), they at least do justice to the genre, and this is better than most of the many cop movies that followed The French Connection into release.\\" Vincent Canby wrote in his review in The New York Times, \\"Popeye is a colorful and interesting ‚Äî though hardly noble ‚Äî character, and when the Marseille drug people kidnap him, forcibly create a heroin habit in him, and then release him, you have a very special kind of jeopardy that the film and Mr. Hackman exploit most effectively.\\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \\"an intelligent action melodrama\\" with a performance from Hackman that was so \\"excellent\\" as to \\"suggest the possibility of winning another major award for the same character in a sequel film.\\"Murphy, Arthur D.

Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded three stars out of four and wrote, \\"Too many Popeye histrionics turns one of the screen's more compelling characters into a bit of a cartoon.

Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 2. Paul D. Zimmerman wrote in Newsweek that Doyle's drug addiction in the middle of the film \\"stalls the story\\" and that the action-packed climax \\"seems executed for those seeking the shoot-'em-up sequel that Frankenheimer apparently wanted to avoid. If the movie ultimately doesn't work, this can be said in Frankenheimer's defense: that, with every right and probably much pressure to do so, he refused to rip off 'The French Connection' as so many films with other names already had.\\"Zimmerman.

Published in 1935, its music was written by Hugh Williams (pseudonym for Wilhelm Grosz) with lyrics by prolific songwriter Jimmy Kennedy.J. J. Kennedy The Man Who Wrote The Teddy Bears' Picnic: How Irish-born lyricist ...- 2011 146788569X \\"However, before he wrote anything with Carr, Jimmy Kennedy had more successful songs with Will Grosz, including possibly his most famous ballad, Red Sails in the Sunset. Red Sails in the Sunset sold more copies than any other UK song in 1935, with notable recordings by Lew Stone, Ambrose, Joe Loss and virtually all the other orchestras. Top vocalists included Vera Lynn, Gracie Fields, Al Bowlly and Greta Keller. In America it was voted the No. 2 song of the year by NBC's new and influential radio network show, Your Hit Parade, . The song was inspired by the \\"red sails\\" of Kitty of Coleraine, a yacht Kennedy often saw off the northern coast of Ireland and by his adopted town Portstewart, a seaside resort in County Londonderry. The title of the song provides the inspiration for the Red Sails Festival held annually in Portstewart, Northern Ireland. Kennedy wrote the song while staying in Portstewart. The song was used in the Broadway production of Provincetown Follies which ran from November 3 until December 19, 1935 at the Provincetown Playhouse. Popular versions in 1935 were by Bing Crosby, Guy Lombardo, Mantovani and Jack Jackson. Another early version was recorded by Al Bowlly with Ray Noble and his Orchestra on September 18, 1935. Louis Armstrong also had a hit with the song in 1936. The song was revived by Nat King Cole in 1951. This version was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 1468. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on July 13, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart, peaking at #24. It was also recorded by Tab Hunter in 1957. A rock-and-roll reworking of the song was often sung by the Beatles during their early years of night club engagements. Vaughn Monroe also recorded this song in the late 1940s Another version was released in 1954 on MGM 11977 by Sam \\"The Man\\" Taylor and His Orchestra, with Sam on tenor saxophone. An instrumental version of the song became the signature tune of the Philippine radio drama series Dear Kuya Cesar, broadcast on DZMM radio (ABS-CBN) in the sixties and hosted by Cesar Lacbu Nucum, a.k.a. Kuya Cesar. The song was also the signature tune of Suzette Tarri, a British actress and comedian popular on stage and radio in the 1930s and 1940s.

Early life and family Isoviƒá was born into a Bosniak family in Bileƒáa, located in the Herzegovina region of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, while it was a part of Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Safet was one of three children of Ermina and Ahmet Isoviƒá; his brother's name was Fehim and his sister was Fehma. Safet's father Ahmet was the son of Zaim Isoviƒá, whose first wife, Dervi≈°a (n√©e Barakoviƒá), died during childbirth on 19 June 1900. Safet became a war refugee at the age of five in 1941 when Yugoslavia was invaded by Nazi Germany. His family escaped to Banja Luka, where he attended elementary school. After the war, the Isoviƒá family returned to Bileƒáa. In his youth, Safet's family moved around Yugoslavia and lived in several cities, including Bileƒáa, Banja Luka, Trebinje and Slavonski Brod. Career Upon graduating from high school, Isoviƒá wanted to enroll in college in Zagreb, but under pressure from his parents he moved to Sarajevo in 1955 and began attending law school. While studying in Sarajevo, he was persuaded by college friends to audition for the student ensemble ‚ÄúSlobodan Princip Seljo,‚Äù where he impressed the panel. Shortly after joining the group, friends persuaded him to audition for Radio Sarajevo. He failed his first audition but passed the second and spent the following year with music teachers, singing and learning to play the piano. After a year of study, he was invited to record two songs, which were released on 6 April 1957. Isoviƒá held his first solo concert on 19 March 1963 in Belgrade and was the only singer from the former Yugoslavia ever to perform at the Sydney Opera House in Australia. During his 50+ year-long career, he covered many sevdalinka and Bosnian folk songs, including Moj dilbere. Isoviƒá won many awards and performed at some of the largest festivals throughout the former Yugoslavia. This contributed significantly to the rebirth of the sevdalinka. He won the Golden Microphone award in Yugoslavia and 35 regional silver and gold record awards. In a radio interview, fellow Bosnian sevdalinka singer Silvana Armenuliƒá said that she was a fan of his music and called Isoviƒá her \\"darling.\\" Personal life and politics Although a self-described anti- Communist, Isoviƒá spent time with communist politicians Avdo Humo and D≈æemal Bijediƒá, and Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito and his wife Jovanka Broz. Isoviƒá was an SDA delegate in the Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the summer of 1992, Isoviƒá was injured by bombing during the Bosnian War, which followed the dissolution of Yugoslavia. During the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, Isoviƒá became a war refugee for the second time in his life, living in Zagreb, Croatia until the end of the Bosnian War. He spent the final decade of his life in Sarajevo. Death Isoviƒá died on 2 September 2007 in Sarajevo and was buried the next day at Ali Pasha's Mosque. His death provoked a massive outpouring of grief around the country. At a memorial service held at the National Theatre of Bosnia and Herzegovina, he was called the \\"Father of the Sevdalinka\\" by Beba Selimoviƒá. The Minister of Culture and Sport, Emir Had≈æihafizbegoviƒá said that Safet Isoviƒá did great deeds both when he spoke and when he sang.

A patio home or cluster home is an American house in a suburban setting, part of a unit of several houses attached to each other, typically with shared walls between units, and with exterior maintenance and landscaping provided through an association fee. Not all of these elements are present in all buildings called patio homes, as the term is used somewhat generically by the real estate industry. The building may actually be a condo in which the owner holds a fractional interest in the land throughout the development, or it may be titled as a townhome in which each homeowner holds direct title to the land on which their unit is built. Targeted buyers are primarily those who do not want to be bothered by external maintenance typically associated with home ownership, sometimes because they only live in the patio home for part of the year. There is not usually a legal definition of a patio home, and some houses called patio homes may alternatively be marketed as townhouses, garden homes, twin homes, or carriage homes. Most taxing jurisdictions do not have a separate classification for patio homes. The term was first seen in print in the mid-1970s.

Yahu-Bihdi (Akkadian: íÖÄíåëíÅâíÄ™íÅ≤) also called Ilu-Bihdi (Akkadian: íÄ≠íÅâíÄ™íÅ≤) was a governor of Hamath appointed by the Assyrian government. He declared himself king of Hamath in 720 BC and led a revolt which was promptly suppressed. Yahu-Bihdi himself was flayed alive. His revolt occurred roughly shortly after the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by Sargon II and roughly simultaneously with revolts in Babylon as well as in Arpad, Damascus and elsewhere in the Levant. His name, with the component Yahu (coupled with the fact that 'Ilu' was considered an appropriate substitutive element), suggests that he may have been an Israelite or a worshipper of Yahweh. Following his defeat, many residents of Hamath were deported to Samaria by the Assyrians, where they became one of the component groups of the Samaritan people. Hamath itself was destroyed after the siege, but had been rebuilt by the 400's BC.

With them are two Police officers, and Fehmer's assistant (far left), disguised as a woman Siegfried Wolfgang Fehmer (10 January 1911 in Munich ‚Äì 16 March 1948) was a German Gestapo officer during World War II. He was stationed in Norway during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, and at the end of the war he was a Kriminalrat, the police investigator heading the infamous Abteilung IV from its headquarters in Victoria Terrasse, Oslo. He had also reached the rank of Hauptsturmf√ºhrer in the SS. Along with Josef Terboven, Fehmer was considered one of the most despised members of the German occupation forces in Norway. History Fehmer joined the National Socialist German Workers Party in January 1930 and was employed by the Gestapo from 1934. He was promoted several times and held different positions within the organization, until in April 1940 he was sent to Norway. There he worked with counter-intelligence and suppressing the resistance. Fehmer wore an SS uniform with Sicherheitsdienst badges. The Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Security Service) was primarily the intelligence service of the SS and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany. With a striking appearance and charm, he was perceived as quite the ladies man. Despite this outward appearance, Fehmer was ruthless, and did not hesitate to use torture during interrogation of suspects. He has been described by his victims as capable of switching from using a friendly approach to sadistic torture in a heartbeat. Milorg (the military branch of the Norwegian resistance movement) saw him as a severe threat. Several plans for his assassination were made, and Fehmer survived one such attack with several gunshot wounds to his chest. At the end of the war, on 8 May 1945, Fehmer dressed as a Wehrmacht soldier. He mixed in with other German POWs at Haslemoen Camp, but was betrayed and arrested after having made a telephone call to a female friend. Fehmer was tried and convicted of war crimes, and sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Norway. The sentence was carried out by firing squad at Akershus Fortress on 16 March 1948. In pop culture One of the main characters in the 2008 Norwegian film Max Manus, he was portrayed by the German actor Ken Duken. External links *Siegfried Fehmer at the Norsk biografisk leksikon.

Exepos√© is free and published fortnightly during term time.The University of Exeter - Undergraduate Study - Studying in Exeter - Students' Guild Its sections include news, features, lifestyle, science, and sport, with review sections covering films, music, arts and literature, and games. Exepos√© is compiled by a team of around 46 section editors, two photographers, headed by four editors, two print and two online, and two deputies.Exepos√© - The Team It was the winner of the NUS Student Publication of the Year 2008 and is used as a forum for reportage and debate of both national and student-related issues. As of the 2006‚Äì2007 academic year it became a full colour fortnightly paper available to all students at the Streatham and St. Luke's campuses. From 2010 onwards it has increased online presence through Twitter and Facebook as well as online viewing platforms such as Issuu.com. In September 2012 Exepos√© launched its own website, after the now-defunct Xmedia Online site had stopped operating as a news service. History Exepos√© released its first issue to the students of Exeter University in 1987, although the existence of a student newspaper in some form can be traced back to 1938 when the latest news was presented in a broadsheet format newspaper called The South Westerner.University of Exeter Library and Information Service During the early to mid-1990s, Exepos√© was produced on a typewriter in an eight-page A4 booklet format, with sections including news, reviews, sport and an agony aunt feature.Exepos√© Issue 1, October 1990 In the mid-1990s, Exepos√© became a weekly tabloid newspaper, ranging in size from 8 to 12 pages, and printed by Express & Echo Publications (which has since gone through several name and structural changes, its publishing arm now known as Harmsworth Printing).Harmsworth Printing During the late 90s, Exepos√© began to increase in size to 16-20 pages on average, some of these pages in spot colour or full colour. Between 2,000 and 2,500 papers were printed for each issue, distributed to drop-off points on Streatham and St. Luke's Campuses. Exepos√© Logo 1997-2005. In 1997, a new Exepos√© logo was designed, based on the Carlsberg logo (as shown in the gallery below) and from 1997-2000 the paper proclaimed itself to be 'Probably the Best Student Newspaper in the World'.Exepos√©, Fresher's Week Issue, October 1997 The logo is the longest running in the newspaper's history, its use spanning 8 years and over 150 issues.Exepos√© Issues from 1997-2005, including the highly successful 2000 year where they won student media awards from The Guardian and The Independent under the editorship of Jared Wilson (who went on to form LeftLion) and Rich Thurston. In 2006 this logo was replaced by a new masthead more similar to national newspaper mastheads.Exepos√© website In 2007 the paper hit national headlines after Boris Johnson made controversial comments on the subject of the death of an Exeter student in an interview with the paper. His criticism of the University's Athletic Union and its ban on initiation ceremonies was featured by the BBC, The Sun, The Guardian, Daily Express, Daily Mirror, The Times and Daily Mail.BBC News Johnson later made a statement regarding the intention of his comments on his website.Boris Johnson online Exepos√©'s parent site X-Media Online launched a new web-portal for the newspaper in September 2007 as part of an overhaul of all student media sites at the University of Exeter and saw more content put online. Over time, the role of X-Media Online developed from a purely technical, hosting function to its own individual news source, effectively creating a new news source on campus and distinguishing itself from Exepos√©. During the 2011-12 academic year, plans were made to reunify X-Media Online and Exepos√©, rebranding the online news site to form the paper's new website. In 2008, the R&R; section was redesigned so as to be a part of the main newspaper, rather as a separate pull-out, in an effort to increase readership of the section. In June of the same year, writing from Exepos√© was showcased in the inaugural issue of FS Magazine as an example of \\"the best of student journalism\\". The paper underwent further re- designs from May to September 2010, updating its masthead once again, introducing new headline and body fonts and introducing coloured section banners, attempting greater design consistency. In March 2011, Exepos√© sought greater outreach through Twitter, Facebook and issuu as part of a strategy to further increase the paper's readership. Exepos√© Logo 2012-2014. In August 2012, Exepos√© launched its own website, incorporating the previously separate X-Media Online. The website launched with an entirely new online editorial team. In October 2012, Exepos√© celebrated its 25th Anniversary with an exhibition of past front pages on campus, a birthday party at Reed Hall and a special anniversary edition of the paper featuring interviews with past editors. Under the editorship of Tom Payne and Zoe Bulaitis, the 2012/13 editorial year saw Exepos√© get nominated for the 'Student Publication of the Year' prize at the Guardian Student Media Awards - the first time the paper had been nominated for such an award in over five years. During that year the paper experienced an increase in the paper's readership with the launch of the website and a number of new innovations - including a new logo and complete re-design of the paper. Exepos√© Online won runner-up 'Student Website of the Year' at the Guardian Student Media Awards 2014, following the editorship of Olivia Luder, Liam Trim, Meg Lawrence and Callum Burroughs (2013-2014, 2014-2015). The editors also spearheaded investigative and campaigning front- page stories, starting in May 2012, many of which received local and national media attention and proved popular with readers. In January 2013 Exepos√© made national headlines after it controversially reported that staff members working for The Students' Guild filmed and distributed footage of students engaging in sexual activity during the University's notorious Safer Sex Ball. The paper then landed one of the biggest scoops in its history, finding and breaking the news that the 21-year-old ball had been cancelled by the Students' Guild. The news was picked up by BBC, the Independent, The Daily Telegraph, the Huffington Post, the Daily Mail, and The Guardian. The paper also received media attention for its investigation into cocaine use across campus, and its expos√© of the questionable human rights record of Exeter University's largest donor. Exepos√© Logo 2014-2016 In 2014/15, Exepos√© continued with its focus on investigative journalism, under the editorship of Harrison Jones and Gemma Joyce. In September 2014, the paper reported on undercover footage of a University Sports team participating in an initiation- style ceremony that took place on University premises. They reported that the footage showed first year students being intimidated, forced to down shots and kiss a dead eel at an event that appeared to break the Athletic Union's code of conduct on numerous counts. The story was picked up by the Daily Mail and chosen by the Huffington Post as one of their 'Student Journalist Stories Of The Year 2014.' The paper was also threatened with legal action by the University after it published a story relating to the expenses of University staff. Exepos√© was nominated for 'Student Publication of the Year' at the 2015 Guardian Student Media awards, with Editor Harrison Jones also shortlisted for two individual awards. Under the 2015/16 Print Editors Sarah Gough and James Beeson, the paper has reported on issues such as student voting intentions at the General Election, staff redundancy, overcrowding on campus and diversity at the University. Alongside this, Online Editors Harry Shepherd and Kayley Gilbert relaunched the website. At the end of the 2015/16 editorial year, the newspaper won 'Best Use of Digital Media' at the 2015 Student Publication Association awards and was also shortlisted for 'Best Student Publication.' Exepos√© Logo 2016-present In preparation for the newspaper's 30th anniversary in 2017, Exepos√© saw a full redesign under the 2016/17 Print Editors - Jeremy Brown, Ben Londesbrough, Hannah Butler and Susannah Keogh - featuring a stylish, minimalist layout, a restyled culture section called 'Exhibit', and an update to the logo, which was launched in collaboration with the Online Editors - Theodore Stone and Jessica Stanier. In November 2016, Exepos√© also took part in the largest collaborative X-Media event to date: live coverage of the US Election, which involved a team of over 100 people. Technical background With the transition to tabloid format in 1995, Exepos√© was produced on a single Apple Macintosh IIcx with a 21-inch monochrome CRT monitor. Increased advertising revenue convinced the Guild to purchase an Apple Power Macintosh 8515 in 1996, and later a Power Macintosh 8600, each with a 21-inch CRT monitor. All Macs ran QuarkXPress 3.32. A scanner and an A3 ink-jet printer and Adobe Photoshop 4 on the PowerMacs allowed substantial amounts of pre-production to be done in the editorial office. This was located in a small room on Top Corridor (later known as Guild Corridor) within Devonshire House on Streatham Campus. During post production each week, the pages and images were transferred, initially to an external portable HDD and later to several 100MB Zip disks, and physically taken down to the Express & Echo Newspaper Office at the Sowton Industrial Estate, Exeter. There, the paper was checked for consistency, proofread and sent to Data Reception for printing. The Express & Echo Editorial Team also assisted in checking Exepos√© for any legal issues contained in the articles, although this service was stopped in 2001. The whole post production process took on average 6 hours to complete for each issue, a task that became hampered by the increasing age of the computer equipment in use. Technical problems plagued the paper during the period from the summer of 1999 until the middle of 2000, during which the only printer in the Editorial Office remained out of service. Despite technical problems, it was during this time that Exepos√© ran a campaign against the University's Domestic Services that won the paper a Guardian Media Award for Best Student Media Campaign. The centerpiece of the campaign was a \\"cut-out- and-sue\\" coupon, printed in the paper, written in protest at the poor upkeep of halls of residence at the time. The coupon encouraged students to write their name in a box on the page, which stated that they would begin legal action against Domestic Services. Hundreds of students signed their name on these coupons, and then posted them to the University. In 2001, the University of Exeter Students' Guild authorised the purchase of two new Windows PCs, running QuarkXPress 4.1, Adobe Photoshop 5 and Adobe Acrobat 5.0.Minutes of the Guild Executive Meeting, May 2001 This enabled the post production process to become streamlined, with the pages being converted to PDF format before being e-mailed to the Express & Echo for printing. In 2003, the editorial office was moved from Devonshire House to Cornwall HouseExepos√©, Fresher's Week Issue, September 2003 where Exepos√© was produced until it moved back to Devonshire House in 2012. In 2007, QuarkXpress 4.1 was replaced by Adobe InDesign on all of the PCs in the Exepos√© office, which were again upgraded in 2010 to Apple Mac Minis, running the same, also upgraded, programmes. In September 2012, production of Exepos√© moved to new offices in Devonshire House where it continues to be produced in-house, where it shares its office with the University's student-run online television network, XTV.

Unfortunately, he had no financial backing to support his invention. He resolved to steal money he needed for his invention. He later used his invention to steal more. Soon, he had an army of mechanical insects. Two of his many insects were stag beetles who could bite through steel and spiders with webs that could support the weight of a man. Bertram took the name of the Bug-Eyed Bandit. He was thwarted by the Atom.Atom #26 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1966) Later, he accidentally discovered Atom's identity of Ray Palmer and fought him on different occasions. When he was about to use an amnesiac gas he had invented on Atom, he accidentally uses it on himself. He remains in a state of amnesia for years. During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, millions of Shadow Demons, servants of the Anti-Monitor, attack the Earth. Bertram is one of the many casualties.\\"Crisis On Infinite Earths\\" (1985) Marv Wolfman has gone on record saying that he killed both the original Bug-Eyed Bandit and the Ten-Eyed Man because he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be part of a company that would print [them]\\". In Grant Morrison's Animal Man storyline \\"Deus Ex Machina\\", Psycho-Pirate, while in Arkham Asylum, recreated characters removed from continuity.

The current one is the son of the original Bug-Eyed Bandit, but not very successful. Bug-Eyed Bandit recently reappeared in Villains United and Infinite Crisis as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Society. His current whereabouts are unknown.  Powers and abilities  The Bug-Eyed Bandit was proficient in the field of robotics and micro-circuitry and used this talent to create a horde of small robotic insects.  In other media  Television = * The Bertram Larvan version of Bug-Eyed Bandit appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. This version possesses the ability to shrink down to the size of an insect. In \\"Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure\\", he is shown fighting the Atom on Aquaman's windshield in micro-size until Aquaman wipes them off with his windshield wipers.

Arrowverse  Brie Larvan (Emily Kinney) as seen in The Flash. * A female version of the Bug-Eyed Bandit appears in The Flash episode \\"All Star Team Up\\", portrayed by Emily Kinney. Brie Larvan, (also known as the Queen Bee) is a scientist armed with robotic bees that she controls remotely. She was fired from her position at Mercury Labs by Tina McGee when fellow scientists Lindsay Kang and Bill Carlisle discovered that Brie intended to weaponize her project rather than use it for agricultural purposes. Growing bitter at this, Brie planned her revenge on the three of them. She manages to kill Kang and Carlisle with robotic bees with stingers containing apitoxin, and she is nicknamed the \\"Bug-Eyed Bandit\\" by Cisco Ramon and Ray Palmer. Brie's attempt to kill Tina McGee is thwarted when Palmer uses his exo-suit to lure the bees over water to disable their circuitry. With help from Felicity Smoak, Flash then tracks Brie to her base and captures her. Brie is also referred to as \\"Queen Bee\\" in the episode, a moniker used by several DC villains. * Kinney reprises her role as Brie Larvan in the Arrow episode \\"Beacon of Hope\\". Imprisoned in Iron Heights after fighting Flash, Brie uses her court-sanctioned computer time to change her prison release date to March 29, 2016. She has been diagnosed with a tumor on her spine, one which will render her paraplegic once it is removed. She takes Palmer Tech's board members hostage using improved robotic bee drones ‚Äì ones that can adapt to attacks ‚Äì to force Felicity Smoak to turn over schematics to the prototype microchip that allows Felicity to walk after being paralyzed herself. Green Arrow and his team try to rescue the hostages, but one of the drones lodges itself inside his body and begins replicating itself, threatening to release dozens more drones. Palmer Tech employee Curtis Holt helps Team Arrow successfully destroy the mini-swarm, then devises a method to hack Larvan's remaining bees, commanding them to sting her. The overdose of apitoxin from the stings leaves Brie in a coma. She is taken by SCPD and put in Starling General Hospital to be treated. Although Brie's actions were criminal, it changes Felicity's perspective of how Palmer Tech should be used to change people's lives for the better rather than just being a corporate entity chasing profit. * Larvan, once again portrayed by Kinney, returns in the season five episode \\"Gone Rogue\\" of The Flash. Having come out of her coma, she teams up with Rag Doll, Weather Witch and XS as the Young Rogues for a heist on McCulloch Technologies. Larvan is shown to hate the name \\"Bug-Eyed Bandit\\" and tells Weather Witch not to use it. She is given Spencer Young's meta-tech cellphone by XS as a new way of controlling her robotic bees. After Larvan and Weather Witch turn on XS, they are apprehended by her and the Flash.

He is the founder of the Odin Theatre and the International School of Theatre Anthropology, both located in Holstebro, Denmark. Together with Peter Brook, he is considered to be the last living western master. Biography Although Barba was born in Brindisi, he grew up in Gallipoli in the Province of Lecce, where his family came from. His family's socio-economic situation changed significantly when his father, a military officer, was wounded in the Second World War and died soon after. Upon completing high school at the Nunziatella military academy of Naples in 1954, he abandoned the idea of following his father into the military. Instead, in 1954, he emigrated to Norway to work as a welder and a sailor. He also took a degree in French, Norwegian literature, and history of religion at Oslo University. In 1961 he went to Warsaw in Poland to study theatre direction at the State Theatre School, but left one year later to join Jerzy Grotowski, who at that time was the leader of Teatr 13 Rzedow in Opole. Barba stayed with Grotowski for three years. In 1963 he traveled to India where he had his first encounter with Kathakali, a theatre form which had received little attention in the West up to that time. Barba wrote an essay on Kathakali which was published in Italy, France, the US and Denmark. His first book, Grotowski in search of a Lost Theatre, was published in Italy and Hungary in 1965. When Barba returned to Oslo in 1964, he wanted to become a professional theatre director, but as he was a foreigner, he was not welcome in the profession. In this period he became a close friend to the Norwegian author and rebel Jens Bj√∏rneboe with whom he wanted to start the theatre group. Together, they gathered a group of young people who had not passed their admission test to Oslo's State Theatre School, and created the Odin Teatret on 1 October 1964. The group trained and rehearsed in an air raid shelter. Their first production, Ornitofilene, by the Norwegian author Jens Bj√∏rneboe, was performed in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. They were subsequently invited by the Danish municipality of Holstebro, a small town in the Northwest, to create a theatre laboratory there. They were offered an old farm and a small sum of money to set them on their feet. Since then Barba and his colleagues have made Holstebro the base for the Odin Teatret. During the past forty two years Eugenio Barba has directed 65 productions with Odin Teatret and the Theatrum Mundi Ensemble, some of which have required up to two years of preparation. Among the best known are Ferai (1969), Min Fars Hus (My Father‚Äôs House) (1972), Brecht‚Äôs Ashes (1980), The Gospel According to Oxyrhincus (1985), Talabot (1988), Itsi Bitsi (1991), Kaosmos (1993) and Mythos (1998). Some of the more recent productions are Salt (2002), Great Cities under the Moon (2003), Andersen's Dream (2005), Ur-Hamlet (2006) and Don Giovanni all'Inferno (2006) in collaboration with Ensemble Midtvest. Since 1974, Eugenio Barba and Odin Teatret have devised their own way of being present in a social context through the practice of theatre \\"barter\\", an exchange through performance with a community. In 1979 Eugenio Barba founded the International School of Theatre Anthropology (ISTA). He is on the advisory boards of scholarly journals such as The Drama Review, Performance Research, New Theatre Quarterly, Teatro e Storia and Teatrolog√≠a. Among his most recent publications, translated into several different languages, are The Paper Canoe (Routledge), Theatre: Solitude, Craft, Revolt (Black Mountain Press), Land of Ashes and Diamonds. My Apprenticeship in Poland, followed by 26 letters from Jerzy Grotowski to Eugenio Barba (Black Mountain Press) and, in collaboration with Nicola Savarese, The Secret Art of the Performer and the revised an updated version: A Dictionary of Theatre Anthropology (Centre for Performance Research/ Routledge). Awards and recognition Eugenio Barba has been awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of √Örhus, Ayacucho, Bologna, Havana, Warsaw, University of Plymouth (UK) and the \\"Reconnaissance de M√©rite scientifique\\" from the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. He is also a recipient of the Danish Academy Award, Mexican Theatre Critics' prize, Diego Fabbri prize, Pirandello International prize, the Sonning Prize of the University of Copenhagen and the Academy of Performing Arts (Hong Kong). Eugenio Barba was brother to the late Ernesto Barba, a prominent Italian hotelier.

At its highest, Westerdale Moor rises to 429 metres in the vicinity of Ralphs Cross, and Baysdale Moor to the south-west reaches 433 metres at Stony Ridge ‚Äì the second highest point of the North York Moors. Much of the moor is covered by peat and heather and descending into the dale, bilberry and some bracken can be found, with Soft rush and sphagnum in boggy areas. Bracken is no longer widespread on Westerdale Moor, since an eradication programme by a previous landowner. There are some trees by the streams which are tributaries of the Esk ‚Äì mainly Alder, Mountain Ash, Birch, Oak and Holly. Near Stockdale beck are fragments of ancient woodland on steep slopes and, as in nearby Baysdale, a few junipers can be found. During the 19th century, the moor was the site of several collieries. =The farmed dale= Despite its rather remote upland location, Westerdale has been farmed for thousands of years. Soil types vary across the dale (and often in the same field), through strong clays to free-draining shale. Historically some of the more fertile lower fields grew a range of arable crops particularly barley, oats, turnips and potatoes, but more recently most farms concentrate on grass for grazing and the production of hay and silage as winter feed. Dividing and stock-proofing the fields, there are many miles of dry stone walls in several styles ‚Äì and built over a very long timespan. There are also some good hedges and in recent years much work has been done to safeguard and improve both walls and hedges through a National Park sponsored programme. =Westerdale Hall= Westerdale Hall Westerdale Hall is a substantial stone and slate-roofed building, located close to the west side of the village. It was designed by Thomas Henry Wyatt and originally built as a shooting lodge, mainly for grouse shooting in the late summer and autumn. After the Second World War it became a popular youth hostel, but is now a private residence with many of its original external features remaining intact. =Hunters Sty Bridge= An ancient stone arch over the River Esk near the village. By the road towards Kildale, but the modern road crosses the Esk by a ford nearby. This route would have been well travelled in the past, as the way to Baysdale Abbey and Gisborough Priory. The bridge was restored by the Duncombe family in the late 19th century (a date stone on the downstream side states 1874), but the underside of the arch retains interesting Medieval ribbed stonework. It is thought the Knights Templar may have been involved in the construction; it is of that period. =The Esklets= The River Esk rises as numerous small streams in the upper part of Westerdale, known as \\"The Esklets\\" ‚Äì which is close to neighbouring Farndale. Until recently, water was extracted from these streams for public supply but this is no longer the case and the old pumping station stands empty. Links with the Knights Templar Agricultural land and a hall, situated in the Westerdale area, were given to the Order of Knights Templar at an early period in the 12th century. The property was donated by Guido de Bovingcourt who owned the land, together with other holdings in nearby Baysdale (a.k.a. Basedale/Handale/ Grendale). Bovingcourt was a supporter of the Cistercians and donated a number of other lands in the area to them including Battersby, Stokesley, Newby, and Baysdale itself. At Baysdale, he provided a home for a small congregation of Cistercian nuns who lived in a small abbey there, supported by mining and smelting rights near Westerdale village. The remains of the fortifications of the hall given to the Templars by Bovincourt was situated to the north of the present day Westerdale Hall (formerly a Youth Hostel) and was excavated by the warden's son, Paul Wheater, in 1960. He found evidence of a main chamber together with a kitchen, a brewery, animal quarters and a chapel. In the book The Story of Danby by the late Dr Bob Robinson (1991), we are told that the Templars of Temple Newsam, Leeds, appointed the then prominent Westerdale Preceptory in 1119 to be the head of the North Yorkshire Templars. The Preceptory prospered for around two hundred years until 1309 when the Templars were suppressed. William de la Fenne was Westerdale's last preceptor and it is likely that with their impending suppression, he encouraged his Templars to turn much of their valuable goods into cash. A listing of their removable possessions is surprisingly small, particularly in the light of us being told that Westerdale had been declared the 'head Preceptory of North Yorkshire'. The granary contained only 4 bushels (100 kg) of rye. As to the boundaries of the Templar lands at Westerdale, there is little evidence of their limits. A number of mediaeval crosses and stones stand on the moorland around this area and no doubt some of them could easily be markers for Templar boundaries. The Reverend George Young in his History of Whitby and Streoneshalh Abbey (1817) says: :many [stone crosses and markers] were set up to prevent disputes over territory and serve as landmarks......this plan was especially adopted by the Knights Templars and Hospitallers......

The city is built on a mound thought to have been built by the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilisation. Very little excavation has sought to confirm this. the Archeology Department, Government of Pakistan carried out the last excavation in 1978. Among other objects, coins dating back to Alexander the Great's time (c. 323 BC) were discovered at the site. A large area of unexcavated mounds extends to the south-west of the city where ancient bricks and shards of pottery can be found on the surface. Popular legend holds that the city has been destroyed nine times in the past. The present name is popularly believed to have been derived from 'Chunni', name of a daughter of Raja Todar Mal, the dewan or revenue minister to Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great. Little historical evidence of this belief has been documented. People of nearby villages call the city Chooni in local dialect of Punjabi. There is a Baradari (building) in Chunian of Raja Todar Mal.

The steppe is often dominated by plumes of Stipa in early summer. Tulipa suaveolens is one of the most typical spring flowers of the Pontic- Caspian steppe. The Pontic steppe or Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe is the steppeland stretching from the northern shores of the Black Sea (called Euxeinos Pontos [Œï·ΩîŒæŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ Œ†œåŒΩœÑŒøœÇ] in antiquity) as far east as the Caspian Sea, from Dobruja in the northeastern corner of Bulgaria and southeastern Romania, through Moldova and eastern Ukraine across Russian Northern Caucasus, Southern and lower Volga regions to western Kazakhstan, forming part of the larger Eurasian steppe, adjacent to the Kazakh steppe to the east. It is a part of the Palearctic realm and the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. The area corresponds to Cimmeria, Scythia, and Sarmatia of classical antiquity. Across several millennia the steppe was used by numerous tribes of nomadic horsemen, many of which went on to conquer lands in the settled regions of Europe, Western Asia, and Southern Asia. The term Ponto-Caspian region is used in biogeography of the flora and fauna of these steppes, including animals from the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and Azov Sea. Genetic research has identified this region as the most probable place where horses were first domesticated. According to the most prevalent theory in Indo- European studies called the Kurgan hypothesis, the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe was the homeland of the speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language. Geography and ecology The Pontic steppe covers an area of of Europe, extending from Dobrudja in the northeastern corner of Bulgaria and southeastern Romania, across southern Moldova, Ukraine, through Russia and northwestern Kazakhstan to the Ural Mountains. The Pontic steppe is bounded by the East European forest steppe to the north, a transitional zone of mixed grasslands and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. To the south, the Pontic steppe extends to the Black Sea, except the Crimean and western Caucasus mountains' border with the sea, where the Crimean Submediterranean forest complex defines the southern edge of the steppes. The steppe extends to the western shore of the Caspian Sea in the Dagestan region of Russia, but the drier Caspian lowland desert lies between the Pontic steppe and the northwestern and northern shores of the Caspian. The Kazakh Steppe bounds the Pontic steppe to the east. The Ponto-Caspian seas are the remains of the Turgai Sea, an extension of the Paratethys which extended south and east of the Urals and covering much of today's West Siberian Plain in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.

He first appeared in Batman #226 (Nov. 1970) and was created by Frank Robbins, Irv Novick, and Dick Giordano. Fictional character biographyPre-Crisis= Philip Reardon served as a soldier in the U.S. Special Forces during the Vietnam War until he was honorably discharged after a grenade fragment hit him between the eyes. He returned to civilian life as a warehouse security guard. One night, he was knocked out by thieves who planted a bomb to blow up the warehouse. When Batman arrived at the scene, Reardon recovered but his vision was blurred. Mistaking Batman for one of the thieves, Reardon battled him. When he recognized Batman, the warehouse exploded and Reardon's retinas were burned, which impacted his war injury and blinded him permanently in both eyes. A brilliant ophthalmologist named Dr. Engstrom tended to Reardon after being brought to him by the crooks where he reconnected Reardon's optic nerves to the sensory cells in his fingertips. In addition to this, Dr. Engstrom granted Reardon's fingers the gift of sight, enabling him to see through them. He blamed Batman for what had happened and took his revenge on him under the identity of the Ten-Eyed Man. As Batman was also affected by the blast, he used black contact lenses to help him out. As the Ten-Eyed Man attacked Batman, Alfred Pennyworth helped Batman by coordinating instructions to him through the microphone in Batman's mask. Upon finding out that the Ten-Eyed Man can see through his hands, Batman used this to his advantage by using his cape to wrap up the Ten-Eyed Man's hands and then knocked him unconscious. After Batman contacted Dr. Engstrom, the Ten-Eyed Man got away.Batman #226 Waking up one night in his apartment following a nightmare involving Batman attacking him with a flamethrower, the Ten-Eyed Man finds himself unable to see, thinking that Batman blinded him again, only to remember that he had placed gloves on his hands since his \\"eyes\\" do not have eyelids. He then goes to apply for a job as an air marshal, which he passes with his talents and starts making plans to have his revenge on Batman. After hijacking an airplane as a way to lure Batman to Vietnam as part of his revenge, the Ten-Eyed Man led Batman on a cat-and-mouse chase in the jungle using traps that were left after the Vietnam War. He tried to blind Batman with a chemical grenade, but Batman placed the Ten-Eyed Man's hands in a mud pool so that he could subdue him and bring him to justice.Batman #231 When incarcerated at Gotham State Penitentiary, the Ten-Eyed Man was kept in a jail cell, where the correction officers had his hands locked in a special box that kept him blind all day and night because with eyes on his fingers, \\"escape would be child's play for him,\\" although precisely how this would be the case was not elaborated upon. Because of his indisputably unique abilities, he was employed by persons unknown as the only villain worthy to attack the Man-Bat. He was even provided a supervillain costume to go with his talents. During this fight, the Man-Bat threw a shrub at him where the Ten-Eyed Man hurt his \\"eyes\\" when he caught it. After getting some distance from the Ten-Eyed Man, the Man-Bat caught his breath and figured out who the Ten-Eyed Man is. What he does not know is that the Civil Liberties Association had hired the Ten-Eyed Man to attack him. Upon fighting the Ten-Eyed Man, who was preparing to fire a magnesium flare bomb, the Man-Bat forced the Ten-Eyed Man into dropping the bomb enough to emit a blind light that causes the Ten-Eyed Man to be temporarily blinded and fall off the building.Man-Bat #2 During the Crisis on Infinite Earths storyline, the Ten-Eyed Man was accidentally killed by Anti-Monitor's shadow demons.Crisis on Infinite Earths #12 It was reportedly at the specific request of Marv Wolfman to put him among a list of characters he wanted to kill first. His only appearance after that was along with other characters who were wiped out by the Crisis that were recreated by the Psycho-Pirate II.Animal Man #23 =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Ten-Eyed Man first appears among the inmates at Arkham Asylum that attack Batman and Jim Corrigan.Batman Eternal #15 The Ten-Eyed Man is one of the many villains taken down by Batman and Catwoman after he takes her along with him on an average night of his job.Batman (vol. 3) #14 The Ten- Eyed Man later kidnapped a girl named Jade who was under Killer Croc's protection, where he plans to sacrifice her in order to find out the doom that is coming for him. One of his fingers sees Batman, Killer Croc, and Jason Bard above as they leap down towards him upon being discovered.Batman Eternal #19 Batman, Jason Bard, and Killer Croc work to stop the Ten-Eyed Man before he can sacrifice Jade so that he can open an inter-dimensional portal. His plot is thwarted by Batman and Jason Bard.Batman Eternal #20 Following Arkham Asylum's destruction, the Gotham City Police Department's headquarters is filled with its inmates. Maggie Sawyer tries to get the answers on what happened there from the inmates, starting with the Ten-Eyed Man. He tells Maggie that he can help her with the answers she needs if she would remove the hand masks from his hands. After being unable to get answers from the Ten-Eyed Man, Maggie Sawyer then attempts to get answers from Maxie Zeus, the Magpie, and the other Arkham Asylum inmates.Batman Eternal #44 Powers and abilities The Ten-Eyed Man can see through optic nerves in his fingertips, giving him a complete 360 view and limited periscopic vision. His enhanced vision augments his Special Forces training, making him a superb fighter and marksman. Other versions In issue #30 of DC's year-long miniseries 52, an entirely new take on the Ten-Eyed Man was introduced. The Ten-Eyed Men of the Empty Quarter are a nomadic tribe that inhabit the \\"Empty Quarter\\" of an unspecified Middle Eastern desert (though \\"the Empty Quarter\\" is the name of a region in Saudi Arabia) and are dedicated to hunting demons. They wear blindfolds and loose-fitting robes with turbans, and have eyes similar to the original Ten-Eyed Man's tattooed on their fingertips. During the issue, Bruce Wayne wanders the desert in search of them, defeats one of their number in hand-to-hand combat, and asks for them to exorcise his personal demons. When Robin catches up to him, Bruce tells him that they have \\"cut out all the dark, fearful, paranoid urges that I've allowed to corrupt my life\\" and that \\"Batman is gone.\\" Whether there is any connection between this tribe and the villainous Ten-Eyed Man is unknown, but it is unlikely since the original villain was removed from continuity. An exiled member of this tribe, lacking a finger, is introduced as a terrorist in Batman #675. He kidnaps Jezebel Jet, and is defeated by Bruce Wayne, who was so unstable at that point that he didn't even change to his Batman uniform. Grant Morrison referred to this character as the Nine-Eyed Man.Batman #675 (April 2008) In other mediaTelevision= * The Ten-Eyed Man appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. This version is drawn to have \\"eyes\\" on his fingertips. In the episode \\"A Bat Divided\\", he is seen in a bar where the villains hang out when Firestorm and the three Batmen show up. The Ten-Eyed Man is among the villains that fight Firestorm and the three Batmen and is defeated. He later appears at the beginning of the episode \\"Emperor Joker\\", where he tries to rob a jewelry store, only to fight Batman. Bat-Mite appeared during the fight while reviewing the Ten-Eyed Man's history. After Batman cuts himself free from the Ten-Eyed Man's eye-themed Belt Net, Bat-Mite then turns one of Batman's batarangs into a cactus as Batman tricks the Ten-Eyed Man into catching it. The Ten-Eyed Man catches the cactus, which hurts his \\"eyes\\", as Batman ties him up. * In the \\"Tales of Metropolis\\" segment of DC Nation Shorts, the episode where Lois Lane tries to ask Batman questions has one of them being who the scariest villain that Batman has faced. Upon finally answering all of Lois' questions, Batman answer to the scariest villain question is the Ten-Eyed Man. =Film= * The Ten-Eyed Man is mentioned in Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay by a technician, who says his bomb accidentally went off when it was being implanted, confirming that he is dead.

The decrease in phagocytosis results in recurrent pyogenic infections, albinism, and peripheral neuropathy. In Ch√©diak‚ÄìHigashi syndrome, the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene is mutated, leading to disruption of protein synthesis as well as the storage and secretory function of lysosomal granules in white blood cells. This results in defective white blood cell function with enlarged vesicles. This syndrome also leads to neutropenia and phagocyte bactericidal dysfunction due to impaired chemotaxis. Deficiency in serotonin and adenosine-phosphate-containing granules in platelets causes impaired platelet aggregation, leading to prolonged bleeding time. Thus, patients are susceptible to infections and often present with oculo-cutaneous albinism and coagulation defects. Patients often present with early-onset aggressive periodontitis associated with advanced alveolar bone loss and tooth mobility due to neutropenia and defective neutrophil function. Recurrent oral ulcerations are also one of the common oral manifestations in patients with this disease. Dental practitioners who notice child patients who present with recurrent unexplained gingivitis and periodontitis along with hypopigmentation of hair, skin and eyes should consider making a referral to medical practitioners to investigate for the possible diagnosis of Chediak Higashi syndrome. Signs and symptoms People with CHS have light skin and silvery hair (albinism) and frequently complain of solar sensitivity and photophobia. Other signs and symptoms vary considerably, but frequent infections and neuropathy are common. The infections involve mucous membranes, skin, and the respiratory tract. Affected children are susceptible to infection by Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common infectious cause. Infections in CHS patients tend to be very serious and even life-threatening. Neuropathy often begins in the teenage years and becomes the most prominent problem. Few patients with this condition live to adulthood. Most children with Ch√©diak‚ÄìHigashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage known as the \\"accelerated phase\\", or the \\"lymphoma-like syndrome\\", in which defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections, and organ failure. These medical problems are usually life-threatening in childhood. Causes Mutations in the CHS1 gene (also called LYST) located on the chromosome 1q42-q43 have been found to be connected with Ch√©diak‚ÄìHigashi Syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the lysosomal trafficking regulator. Researchers believe that this protein plays a role in the transport (trafficking) of materials into lysosomes. Lysosomes act as recycling centers within cells. They use digestive enzymes to break down toxic substances, digest bacteria that invade the cell and recycle worn-out cell components. Although the lysosomal trafficking regulator protein is involved in the normal function of lysosomes, its exact role is unknown. In melanocytic cells, LYST gene expression may be regulated by MITF. Mutations in MITF are known to cause Waardenburg syndrome type 2 and Tietz syndrome, which result in depigmentation and deafness. Pathophysiology CHS is a disease causing impaired bacteriolysis due to failure of phagolysosome formation. As a result of disordered intracellular trafficking there is impaired lysosome degranulation with phagosomes, so phagocytosed bacteria are not destroyed by the lysosome's enzymes. In addition, secretion of lytic secretory granules by cytotoxic T cells is affected. The disease is characterised by large lysosome vesicles in phagocytes (neutrophils), which thus have poor bactericidal function, leading to susceptibility to infections, abnormalities in nuclear structure of leukocytes, anemia, and hepatomegaly. D√∂hle bodies (remnants of endoplasmic reticulum) in the neutrophil are also seen. Diagnosis The diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow smears that show \\"giant inclusion bodies\\" in the cells that develop into white blood cells (leukocyte precursor cells). CHS can be diagnosed prenatally by examining a sample of hair from a fetal scalp biopsy or testing leukocytes from a fetal blood sample. Under light microscopy the hairs present evenly distributed, regular melanin granules, larger than those found in normal hairs. Under polarized light microscopy these hairs exhibit a bright and polychromatic refringence pattern. =Clinical findings= There are several manifestations of Ch√©diak‚ÄìHigashi syndrome as mentioned above; however, neutropenia seems to be the most common. The syndrome is associated with oculocutaneous albinism. Persons are prone to infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Streptococci. It is associated with periodontal disease of the deciduous dentition. Associated features include abnormalities in melanocytes (albinism), nerve defects, bleeding disorders. Treatment There is no specific treatment for Ch√©diak‚ÄìHigashi syndrome. Bone marrow transplants appear to have been successful in several patients. Infections are treated with antibiotics and abscesses are surgically drained when appropriate. Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir have been tried during the terminal phase of the disease. Cyclophosphamide and prednisone have been tried. Vitamin C therapy has improved immune function and clotting in some patients. Eponym It is named for the Cuban physician and serologist of Lebanese descent Mois√©s Ch√©diak Ahuayda (1903‚Äì1993) and the Japanese pediatrician Otokata Higashi (1883‚Äì1981).

Plot Kira Aso and Rei Kashino meet when Rei asks Kira for directions to a local hospital one day in the park, but instead of telling him the directions she draws him a map and hands it to him without saying a word. On the back of the directions is a picture Kira drew of a mother and child. On the first day of school they are both surprised to find that they are in the same class. Later, Rei walks in on their teacher sexually harassing Kira. Rei promises to protect Kira in exchange for a painted version of the sketch that was on the back of the map. He also offers to \\"lend Kira his body,\\" and she asks him to model for her. Thus beginning a relationship that is opposed by the world in general.

The series will conclude its story with a film which will open in theaters throughout Japan on June 18, 2016.http://www.ntv.co.jp/mars/ =Film= A live-action film adaptation and finale for the Japanese television drama series was released on June 18, 2016. Reception In Understanding Manga and Anime, Robin E. Brenner lists the title among her recommendations for \\"Best Romances and Melodrama\\", stating that \\"this manga romance literally has it all: romance, motorcycle races, bullying, haunted pasts, child abuse, friendly transvestites, murder, sociopaths, and more romance.\\" She considered it an appealing \\"soap opera\\", and praised the scene where Rei and Kira make love as \\"gentle, sweet, and very much focused on the emotional impact on this progression in their relationship\\" versus being focused on \\"titillating readers\\". Reviewing the fourth volume to the series for Library Journal, Steve Raiteri considered Soryo's artwork \\"clean\\" and felt it did an expert job in \\"[portraying] Shiori's desperation, Kira's sadness and uncertainty, and Rei's living-in-the-moment changeability\\". Speaking to the series as a whole, he stated that it would appeal to both teen girls and to older readers due to its \\"depth and quality\\". Though Ross Liversidge the online magazine UK Anime Network had low expectations for the series, he found it to be \\"flawless\\". Rating it a 10 out of 10, he considered its strong points to be its \\"delicate and detailed\\" artwork and, most importantly, its \\"normality, stating that it \\"smacks of a tragedy waiting to happen, and there are times even in this first volume that things start to get serious...but its done so well, and in such an understated manner that its utterly absorbing and keeps your attention.\\" Manga: The Complete Guides author Jason Thompson highly praised the work, rating it four out of four stars. Calling it a \\"well-written, tightly plotted romance\\" that successfully deals with range of \\"powerful issues\\" that avoids being \\"preachy or patronizing\\", he considered Soryo's artwork to be \\"clear and attractive\\". However, he felt the prequel, Mars: Horse With No Name, did not add much to the overall story, noting that only the title story actually relates to the series. While he still praised the artwork and rated it three stars, he also considered the stories were \\"pale in comparison\\" to the original. Manga Life's Park Cooper praised the original Mars, noting that they \\"love[d] the characters, the story, and the tension that lies within the situations\\", but did not recommend doing more than browsing Horse With No Name, finding it to be less impressive and unlikely to appeal even to fans of the main series. He felt the titular story, which tells how Kira and Tatsuya became friends, to be \\"disappointing\\" and did not find it to be up to the same standard as the main series. However, he praised the second story, \\"Sleeping Lion\\", as making the volume worth the purchase and containing \\"the type of context in the story that got me to love MARS in the first place.\\" The final story, \\"A One-Carat Fruit\\", he considered unengaging and left him unable to connect with the central characters. Overall, Cooper noted that while Soryo's artwork was not unique, she created \\"incredible looking characters\\" and \\"did a great job making certain expressions of the characters feel convincing.\\" Further reading * ReferencesExternal links * * Official GTV Zh√†nsh√©n Mars live-action series Category:1996 manga Category:1999 manga Category:2000 comics endings Category:2004 Taiwanese television series debuts Category:2005 Taiwanese television series endings Category:2016 Japanese television series debuts Category:2016 Japanese television series endings Category:Chinese Television System original programming Category:Fuyumi Soryo Category:Japanese television dramas based on manga Category:Kodansha manga Category:Manga-based Taiwanese dramas Category:Manga adapted into films Category:Manga adapted into television series Category:Nippon TV dramas Category:School life in anime and manga Category:Romance anime and manga Category:Sh≈çjo manga Category:Tokyopop titles ","title":"Mars (manga)"},{"id":"2476456","text":"Pontus; 185?‚Äì169 BC; Son of Mithridates III.

Pharnaces I (; lived 2nd century BC), fifth king of Pontus, was of Persian and Greek ancestry. He was the son of King Mithridates III of Pontus and his wife Laodice, whom he succeeded on the throne.Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus, xxxviii. 5, 6 Pharnaces had two siblings: a brother called Mithridates IV of Pontus and a sister called Laodice who both succeeded Pharnaces.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.90 He was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. Life The date of his accession cannot be fixed with certainty; but it is certain, at least, that he was on the throne before 183 BC, in which year he succeeded in reducing the important city of Sinope, which had been long an object of ambition to the Kings of Pontus. The Rhodians sent an embassy to Rome to complain of this aggression, but without effect.Polybius, Histories, xxiii. 9; Strabo, Geography, xii. 3; Livy, Ab urbe condita, xl. 2 About the same time Pharnaces became involved in disputes with his neighbour, King of Pergamon, Eumenes II, which led to repeated embassies from both monarchs to Rome, as well as to partial hostilities. But in the spring of 181 BC, without waiting for the return of his ambassadors, Pharnaces suddenly attacked both Eumenes II and King Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia and invaded Galatia with a large force. Bronze shield in the name of King Pharnakes, Getty Villa (80.AC.60) Eumenes II opposed him at the head of an army: but hostilities were soon suspended by the arrival of the Roman deputies, appointed by the Senate to inquire into the matters in dispute. Negotiations were accordingly opened at Pergamon but led to no result, the demands of Pharnaces being rejected by the Romans as unreasonable, and the war was in consequence renewed. It continued, apparently with various interruptions, until the summer of 179 BC, when Pharnaces, finding himself unable to cope with the combined forces of Eumenes II and Ariarathes IV, was compelled to purchase peace with the cession of all his conquests in Galatia and Paphlagonia, with the exception of Sinope.Polybius, xxiv. 1, 5, 8, 9 xxv. 2; Livy, xl. 20; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca, xxix How long he continued to reign after this we know not; but it appears, from an incidental notice, that he was still on the throne in 170 BC, while he was certainly dead in 154 BC, when his brother Mithridates IV of Pontus is mentioned as King.Polybius, xxvii. 17 The Greek historian Polybius accuses Pharnaces of having an arrogant and violent character, siding with the opinion of Eumenes II and the Romans. Pharnaces married a Seleucid Princess called Nysa, who was the child of princess Laodice IV and crown prince Antiochus.https://www.livius.org/la- ld/laodice/laodice_iv.html Nysa and Pharnaces were related as the parents of Nysa were Pharnaces' first cousins. Pharnaces married Nysa either in 172 BC or 171 BC, through the diplomatic work of the Seleucid King Demetrius I Soter.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p. 52 Honorific statues and inscriptions have survived that were dedicated to Pharnaces and Nysa. Pharnaces set about to establish good relations with the citizens of Athens and the Greek island of Delos. Pharnaces made a benefaction to the people of Athens. The exact nature of the benefaction is unknown; Pharnaces may have made some kind of voluntary donation to Athens, possibly soon after 183 BC.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.32 A lengthy honorific inscription from the Athenians on Delos honors Pharnaces and Nysa. Pharnaces and Nysa received a crown of gold from them and bronze statues of themselves were set up on Delos. Their lengthy Athenian honorific inscription is dated in the Archonship of the Athenian Tychandros or Tychander which is now generally accepted as 160 BC or 159 BC.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.32 Nysa bore Pharnaces two children: a son called Mithridates V of Pontus and a daughter called Nysa of Cappadocia, who is also known as Laodice.Greek Wikipedia article of Nyssa of Pontus Nysa died at an unknown date in the 2nd century BC; she is believed to have died during childbirth.Greek Wikipedia article of Nyssa of Pontus ReferencesSources *B.

Considered as an alternative set theory axiom schema, it is called the Axiom (schema) of (set) induction. It can be used in set theory to prove that all sets satisfy a given property P(x). This is a special case of well-founded induction.  Statement  It states, for any property P, that if for every set x, the truth of P(x) follows from the truth of P for all elements of x, then this property P holds for all sets. In symbols: :\\\\forall x. \\\\Big(\\\\left(\\\\forall y \\\\in x.\\\\, P(y)\\\\right) \\\\rightarrow P(x)\\\\Big)\\\\ \\\\rightarrow\\\\ \\\\forall z \\\\, P(z) Note that for the \\"bottom case\\" where x denotes the empty set, \\\\forall y \\\\in x.\\\\, P(y) is vacuously true. =Comparison with natural number induction= The above can be compared with \\\\omega-induction over the natural numbers n\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0, 1, 2,\\\\dots\\\\\\\\} for number properties Q. This may be expressed as :\\\\Big(Q(0)\\\\land \\\\forall n. (Q(n-1) \\\\to Q(n))\\\\Big)\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ \\\\forall m.\\\\, Q(m) or, alternatively written, :\\\\forall n. \\\\Big(Q(n-1) \\\\to Q(n)\\\\Big)\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ \\\\forall m.\\\\, Q(m) where for \\"bottom case\\" n=0 we take \\"Q(-1)\\" to be true by definition. Note that set-induction can also be treated in a way that treats the bottom case explicitly. With classical tautologies such as (A\\\\to B)\\\\iff( eg A \\\\lor B), the above \\\\omega-induction principle can be translated to the following statement: :\\\\exists n. \\\\Big(Q(n-1) \\\\land eg Q(n)\\\\Big)\\\\ \\\\lor\\\\ \\\\forall m.\\\\, Q(m) This expresses that, for any property Q, either there is any (first) number n for which Q does not hold, despite Q holding for the preceding case, or - if there is no such failure case - Q is true for all numbers. Accordingly, in classical ZF, set- induction can be translated to the following statement, clarifying what form of counter-example prevents a set-property P to hold for all sets: :\\\\exist x. \\\\Big(\\\\left(\\\\forall y \\\\in x.\\\\, P(y)\\\\right) \\\\,\\\\land\\\\, eg P(x)\\\\Big)\\\\ \\\\lor\\\\ \\\\forall z \\\\, P(z) This expresses that, for any property P, either there a set x for which P does not hold while P being true for all elements of x, or P holds for all sets. For any property, if one can prove that \\\\forall y \\\\in x.\\\\, P(y) implies P(x), then the failure case can is ruled out and the formula states that the disjunct \\\\forall z \\\\, P(z) must hold.  Independence  In the context of the constructive set theory CZF, adopting the Axiom of regularity would imply the law of excluded middle and also set-induction. But then the resulting theory would be standard ZF. However, conversely, the set- induction implies neither of the two. In other words, with a constructive logic framework, set-induction as stated above is strictly weaker than regularity.

DeWolf is best known for his early career as a slam poetry champion, his award-winning films for Youth Speaks Bigger Picture Project, live tours with the performance trio The Suicide Kings, hosting the monthly Tourettes Without Regrets at the Oakland Metro OperaHouse, and for his work as a producer and performer on NPR's Snap Judgment. DeWolf has appeared on HBO's Def Poetry, 60 Minutes, UPN, Inside Edition, and CBS. DeWolf directed, wrote and starred in the feature film Smoked. The Movie (2012). He is also the great-grandson of author and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and an outspoken critic of the Church of Scientology. In 2000 he hosted the first ever anti-Scientology summit in Clearwater, Florida. He was named one of the \\"Top 25 People Crippling Scientology\\" by The Village Voice in 2011. Early life De Wolf was born in Eureka, California. Raised Baptist, DeWolf was a \\"hardcore Christian kid\\" who hoped to become a minister. At the age of six, his pastor handed him a book titled The Kingdom of the Cults. It referred to contemporary religious movements, one of which stuck out: Scientology, founded to his surprise by his own great-grandfather, L. Ron Hubbard. Since that point, DeWolf became fascinated with his ancestor's legacy, reading his books, and citing Hubbard's legacy as his inspiration to become an artist. \\"I remember idolizing L. Ron as a kid, and I remember asking my mom all the time why couldn't I meet him,\\" admits DeWolf. \\"I didn't know at that point that he had created a religion, I just knew when I went into a bookstore I could find books by him‚Äîhe was evidence to me that you could be a writer simply by your will alone. Outside of this man running this crazy church and brainwashing millions of people, at the same time he was just another family member.\\" DeWolf calls his great-grandfather \\"one of the greatest con men of the last century.\\" \\"I wanted to meet him,\\" DeWolf said of Hubbard. \\"But he was already in hiding by the time I was born. I was told not to ask my grandfather, L. Ron, Jr., about him,\\" DeWolf said. \\"L. Ron and L. Ron, Jr. were locked in this dangerous end-game, where Junior was trying to flush him out of hiding.\\" DeWolf's grandfather, L. Ron Hubbard Jr., was born in 1934 into a front-row seat for the creation of Scientology. He helped with that family business for a while, but later told Penthouse that \\"99% of anything my father ever wrote or said about himself is untrue,\\" and compared Scientology's inner sanctum, the \\"Sea Org,\\" with the Hitler Youth. \\"I was incredibly religious. Super devout,\\" said DeWolf. \\"I would stand on street corners passing out pamphlets warning about the apocalypse.\\" Yet he entered adolescence feeling alone and troubled, as if a \\"toxic Molotov cocktail\\" simmered inside him. \\"Ever since I was young I would often get sent to the school psychiatrist for what I was writing. A lot of it was just too macabre, in retrospect. But I realized, even when I was a Christian kid, that a lot of what drew me into Christianity‚Äîand what they were certainly exploiting‚Äîwas my fascination with demonology and the apocalypse, the Antichrist and the Whore of Babylon. I must have read the Book of Revelation 10,000 times by the time I was ten years old.\\" He began unleashing more poetry‚Äîand more demons‚Äîat the microphones that were just opening up in the bedroom communities of Benicia and Vallejo in the late 1990s. \\"I would come in with this fire and blood,\\" DeWolf said. \\"And they did not want that.\\"  Slam poetry  He found himself going to open-mic sessions but it was only when he found poetry slams that he came into his own. \\"The first time I went to a poetry slam, it was the only place that people wouldn't kick me out; they would just give me low scores.\\" \\"The competition made me better. It also made me aware of how my words could set the mood of an entire room.\\" \\"I started in Vallejo and Benicia so I have a lot of love for people who just completely are defiant in the space of small towns who create a space for people to speak and to create an open forum. It's like flame throwers for moths. There's a lot of magic that can happen with that. It certainly changed my life.\\" \\"Poetry and spoken word became an outlet for everything that was naked and confessional. There's something raw about simply telling your story without pretense, without props, just you and a microphone. There's no hiding up there, it's just you and your ghosts.\\" Since his first slam in 1999, DeWolf won his way onto seven slam teams, competing on the finals stage at the National Poetry Slam on his first team. He has since become a National Poetry Slam Champion, the Berkeley Grand Slam Champion, a YouthSpeaks Mentor, a featured performer on HBO's Def Poetry Jam hosted by Mos Def, appearing in Season Three with his poem \\"Grim Fairy Tale\\", and taping for Season Five with Dave Chappelle and Lauryn Hill. DeWolf's style has been described as \\"raw and raucous.\\" \\"He brings that same inimitable, avant-garde style to everything he does‚Äîpoetry, playwriting, performance and his latest endeavor, filmmaking.\\" At the same time he began participating in Poetry Slam, DeWolf started teaching Slam in high schools. \\"It gave me a driving force to help the kids like me and give them another model. It made me realize I had survived and chosen art as an escape route.\\" \\"Too often we ignore what young people have to say and they're not asked to express themselves authentically‚Äì people are shoved into writing essays and taught how to speak. That's why bringing slam poetry to kids empowers them and encourages them to think about what they want in a way that they want.\\" Since his Slam beginnings, DeWolf has performed and led writing workshops at over 90 universities, high schools and juvenile detention centers across the globe, working with such organizations as Opera Piccola, Lunchbox International, and Youth Speaks. In 2001 the San Francisco Chronicle characterized DeWolf as \\"a nationally recognized slam poet\\". His work has been featured on 60 Minutes, UPN and NPR. He coached the Youth Speaks team twice, one of which was featured on Brave New Voices on HBO hosted by Common and Rosario Dawson. He opened for B. Dolan on the first Church of Love and Ruin tour, for Shane Koyczan, and was featured in 2014 on All Def Poetry with his poem \\"Rebels Without Applause.\\" He was awarded The East Bay Express Best of the Bay \\"Best Poet\\" twice, in both 2012 and 2013.  The Suicide Kings  As a member of The Suicide Kings performance trio (with Geoff Trenchard and Rupert Estanislao), DeWolf toured the country performing and teaching writing workshops at colleges, high schools, poetry slams, and juvenile detention centers. In 2006 they received funding from the National Performance Network Creation Commission, The Zellerbach Family Foundation, and the City of Oakland to write In Spite of Everything, which premiered at the Oakland Metro, then moved to the EXIT Theatre in San Francisco, eventually touring nationwide and to Moscow. It has been described as \\"a poignant, chilling knockout of a play ... that beautifully incorporates their visceral verse into the brutal narrative to a school shooting.\\" and \\"an eight-minute crime caper about the Columbine shootings in reverse.\\" The play was showcased at the Hip Hop Theater Festival in 2007 and was chosen as one of the \\"top ten\\" plays of the year by East Bay Express the same year. The trio performed worldwide at colleges, high schools, juvenile detention centers. In 2004, they toured with Sage Francis and Doomtree on the Abusement Tour.  Tourettes Without Regrets  In 1999 DeWolf founded the monthly variety show, Tourettes Without Regrets, described on the website as, \\"One part poetry slam, one part freestyle battle, and one part psychotic erotic vaudeville showcase.\\" \\"Tourettes Without Regrets is essentially an evening of absurdity, mixed with artistic precision and insanity.\\" \\"Since 1999, DeWolf has ceaselessly devoted his life to making Tourette's Without Regrets a one-of-a-kind experience for both performers and audience. Commonly known as 'the fight club of underground art,' the variety show acts as a playground for some of the most eccentric and fearless people in the Bay Area.\\" DeWolf says of Tourettes, \\"I'm promising to push their boundaries, to blow their mind, but also to make something feel absolutely alive. It's like being a reverse cult leader as I'm being naked about wanting to brain wash you for your own entertainment and for a hell of a lot cheaper.\\" \\"One of their largest shows of the year is the annual 'F*ck Valentines Day Spectacular' which the irreverent DeWolf is at his most festive, presiding over sex toy giveaways, interpretive dances based on worst sex experiences, competitions to find which audience member survived the most odious ex- boyfriend or -girlfriend (the three winners get to have a pig's heart mailed to the ex's house), a game of 'What's Down My Pants?,' and prank calls to former lovers.\\" Tourettes allows DeWolf \\"to let his inimitable stage presence, fiery banter and wild imagination go full throttle. Most months, \\"full throttle\\" includes some measure of burlesque, bondage, dirty haiku tournaments, lap dances, rap battles, sexual pantomiming and things being set on fire, interspersed with spoken word and stand-up comedy.\\" Over the past 18 years, Tourettes has changed venues repeatedly, moving to Oakland where it started at The Stork Club, then finding its current home where \\"every month, throngs of fans descend upon the Oakland Metro Operahouse, a chilly warehouse with mottled, tar-spattered cement floors, to witness one of Oakland's strangest attractions. Tourettes Without Regrets is a raunchy, attention- deficit vaudeville extravaganza.\\" The show \\"combines variety show with game show for a balanced and rhythmic flow of high-energy scenes: the slam judges introduced themselves by mimicking psychotic animals; two previous \\"dirty haiku\\" champions faced off in three rounds; a sick beatboxing duo gave a perfectly timed set; a surreal burlesque/performance group combined a flute, some high-flown language, and a Snow White strip-tease, etc.\\" Called \\"one of the wildest and most creatively raw variety shows in the Bay Area\\" by SF Weekly, the show has spawned a series of spinoff events, such as the annual Game of Thrones Show, where \\"the crowd is segregated into Starks and Lannisters and crazed interactive games ensue. You help kill off favorite characters and rewrite the ending of the show yourself.\\" The show includes \\"a local \\"choose your own adventure\\" band whose live show involves twelve-sided dice the size of beach balls. As per the night's theme, the group will perform new material inspired by Game of Thrones.\\" The Holy Sh*t Show, lampoons Scientology, and the yearly XXX Show, started in 2012 at the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theater. In DeWolf's own words about Tourettes, \\"If you've never been to a rap battle, if you've never been to a poetry slam, if you've never seen burlesque, if you've never seen stand-up comedy, or dirty haiku, or freakish, inventive contests‚Äîthen that's what the show is for, to put all of those elements into one show. What makes 'Tourettes' individual and unique is throwing all of these elements together and seeing what happens.\\" \\"It's Psychotic vaudeville. It's taking highbrow and lowbrow and making them collide in this demolition derby.\\" The show has won \\"The Best of the Bay\\" multiple times from The East Bay Express, SF Weekly, and the San Francisco Guardian since its inception.  Performance  Beyond his work with spoken word poetry, DeWolf has established himself as a showman and performer in the San Francisco Bay Area. He appears as the regular host for not only Tourettes Without Regrets, but annual festivals such as The East Bay Express Film Awards, Briefs Erotic Film Festival, Scream Film Festival, The Folsom Street Fair, and the Sacramento Horror Film Festival. DeWolf worked as a producer for Oakland-based NPR's Snap Judgement, where he produced a number of stories, and performed several of his own, including The God and the Man, which drew international attention, and The Girl in the Hallway, chronicling the tragedy of Xiana Fairchild, who at age 7 in 1998 was snatched off the street and killed while she lived in the same apartment building as DeWolf.  Smoked the Movie  In 2006 DeWolf began filming Smoked. The Movie, a feature film crime caper set in Oakland that \\"tells the story of three low-lifes, played by the Suicide Kings, who rob a cannabis club after their house is burned down‚Äînot realizing that the club is owned by local crime lord Tyrone Shanks (local slam poet Abdul Kenyatta).\\" \\"Drawn like most of the cast from the spoken word community, Kenyatta's magnetism is so strong that he turns the most cold- blooded character in the film into a kind of hero‚Äîone who sees his own criminal pursuits through the prism of class warfare. Shank calls himself a \\"true motherfuckin' revolutionary,\\" and frequently talks about competing with the CIA for business and targeting rich white folk for addiction.\\" DeWolf spent the next two years \\"chasing his amateur actors 'El Mariachi-style' through the Netherlands of Oakland.\\" \\"DeWolf staged wild-west showdowns in broad daylight ... where cinematic hit squads ran around shooting at one another with live blanks.\\" The impetus for Smoked came from an article about a real cannabis club robbery. \\"'I love crime capers; I love heist films,' said the filmmaker. 'I love the gray illegality of cannabis clubs in general. ... If you robbed a cannabis club what would happen in terms of how would the cops respond?'\\" Straight.com called Smoked \\"mean, bloody, and demented. It's also piss-your-pants hilarious, maddeningly nihilistic, oddly sentimental, weirdly moral, extremely silly, and insanely energetic. It's almost too energetic for the screen, to be honest.\\" \\"full of orgiastic naked clowns, wanton black revolutionary street executions, crappy ninjas, asshole kids, and seemingly countless hippies being tortured to death.\\" \\"exaggerating the dark side of the modern marijuana 'industry' to cartoonishly nasty levels.\\" Picked up for distribution by Indican Studios, the studio that released Boondock Saints, it was a featured film at the Rio Grind Theater Film Festival in Vancouver and the Oakland Underground Film Festival. An ambitious undertaking, DeWolf viewed Smoked as an exploration of his city's culture. \\"There's a lot of history infused in there, a lot of references to Black Panthers and revolution. Oakland and Berkley are right next to each other and even in the history of these cities, there's been this certain element of tension. That tension, and that kind of ideological war, aggression versus pacifism; it's just really interesting to explore.\\"  Films  A year into the filming of Smoked, DeWolf enrolled in college at the San Francisco State University, where he received a film degree. He collaborated with Youth Speaks, a San Francisco-based organization focused on teen spoken word artists. DeWolf has directed multiple films for Youth Speaks' The Bigger Picture Project, \\"a joint effort by the non-profit youth development group Youth Speaks and the UCSF Department of Medicine's Center for Vulnerable Populations to raise awareness of type 2 diabetes. \\"films that flip the motif of the traditional this-is-your-brains- on-drugs PSA style and instead deliver frank messages about the social factors shaping our health. The project also launched a Spanish-language website and two bilingual films, as Latino communities are often disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes.\\" Featured poets visit Bay Area high schools to perform their poetry and coach students to write their own health justice poetry. The films have garnered national attention. His short film 'Thin Line' about a family stricken with Diabetes and amputations \\"was the $5000 Grand Prize Winner of the Real Food Media Film Competition. The following year his film \\"Home Flavoured\\" also won the Grand Prize. The Thin Line and another Youth Speaks collaboration, The Dealer were accepted into the Food and Farm Film Festival. His film Perfect Soldiers won the youth category of The Sacramento Food Film Festival. In 2015 DeWolf was commissioned to direct a feature-length documentary entitled \\"Biker with a Moral Compass: Dr. Dick Fine and the Evolving Culture of SFGH\\", a documentary portraying and paying tribute to the life, times and contributions of UCSF and SFGH physician Dick Fine MD, Founder and Former Director of the General Medicine Clinic. DeWolf's films with The Bigger Picture Project have attracted media attention from civileats.com, Good.is, and KQED. \\"The Bigger Picture has garnered national attention, including a feature on the homepage of The Huffington Post, over 1 million video views, recognition on Upworthy.com and the Food Farms Films Festival, as well as special presentations at the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine Public Health Literacy Roundtable, the National Soda Summit and the James Beard conference. The campaign's most distinguished national awards include the APHA Spirit of 1848 award for best video linking social justice to health, the UCSF 2014 Excellence in Partnership Award, the Real Food Media 2015 Grand Prize, the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California's Young Champion for Latino Health award and most recently best short film in the Youth category at the 2015 Sacramento Food Film Festival.\\" In 2014 DeWolf worked with Youth Speaks' newly formed Off Page Project to create three pivotal films. \\"The Off/Page Project combines the analytical lens of The Center for Investigative Reporting with the groundbreaking storytelling of the literary nonprofit Youth Speaks. Living at the intersection of youth voice and civic engagement, the Off/Page Project provides a multimedia platform for young people to investigate the issues and stories that would otherwise be silenced.\\" \\"In the inaugural video \\"Whispers from the Fields,\\" 19-year-old Monica Mendoza takes on the challenging issue of sexual violence among migrant women farmworkers.\\" \\"Their voices and poems and creative art has the power to change aspects of their lives personally, but also to have an impact on another kid's life and another city's life.\\" \\"This is Home\\" was \\"produced as a part of Subsidized Squalor, a collaborative investigation by CIR, KQED and the San Francisco Chronicle that exposed the failures of the Richmond Housing Authority in California and how it has left residents living in deplorable conditions.\\" The third film, \\"Locked In\\" is \\"a piece depicting the disturbing reality that many youth face in solitary confinement.\\" DeWolf also made three films in collaboration with Write Home, addressing teen homelessness. Several of the films have been featured on Upworthy. In addition to several Youth Speaks collaborations, his film \\"Waiting\\" with performance poet and humorist Thadra Sheridan, called \\"the best fucking video about waiting tables ever\\" by The Bitchy Waiter went viral after appearing on UpWorthy and received over a million views. \\"Ricochet in Reverse,\\" starring Isaac Miller and Rafael Casal is \\"a lyrical retelling of the Columbine school shootings going in reverse, as a meditation on youth violence and survival through art.\\" DeWolf's own short films have garnered accolades and awards across the country. His short noir film \\"A Girl and a Gun\\" won \\"Best Acting Performance at Briefs Erotic Short Film Festival. and \\"Best Writing\\" at Rio's Grind Film Fest in a competition judged by The Soska Sisters, the directors of \\"American Mary.\\" \\"Hey Baby Hey,\\" a film about cat calling and sexual harassment won the \\"Grand Prize Audience Award,\\" \\"Judges Award,\\" \\"Best Acting Performance\\" and \\"Cinematography\\" at the 2015 Briefs Erotic Film Festival. DeWolf's film about a new dating service for monsters, \\"OK MONSTER\\" was the Grand Prize Audience winner at the Scream Horror Film Festival and selected for the Fantastic Planet Festival in Australia. His film \\"Double Agent\\" which remixes a sexual identity into James Bond title sequence was selected for the CineKink Film Festival in NYC. His short film \\"U Turn\\" was selected for a feature-length horror film anthology franchise by Ruthless Pictures and received international distribution. His short film \\"Black Out\\" with Wonder Dave, delving into difficult subject matter talking about kink, sex and race was accepted into the Briefs Erotic Film Festival 2016. DeWolf also directed the controversial \\"Sweet Sh*t of Christ\\" music video with Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits that covers centuries of Christian history in a matter of minutes. The video features featuring a black Jesus carrying a crucifix in downtown Oakland followed by Santa Claus, zombies, the Easter Bunny and priests, a recreation of the Jonestown massacre, live snakes and faith healing. After winning their first ever Hosting Competition, DeWolf now hosts the annual Sacramento Horror FIlm Festival, which features horror burlesque acts and live shadowcasting of films like REPO: The Genetic Opera with live appearances by Skinny Puppy's Nivek Ogre. Family Formerly Jamie Kennedy, DeWolf took his mother's maiden name in 2006 to avoid confusion with actor and fellow comedian Jamie Kennedy. DeWolf is the great-grandson of L. Ron Hubbard; being the grandson of Hubbard's son Ronald DeWolf (n√©e L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.). DeWolf told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2001 that his mother and girlfriend were visited by Scientology agents, who asked about his comments on Scientology in his poetry and his appearance at a November 2000 benefit for the Lisa McPherson Trust in Clearwater, Florida. The poetry piece was titled \\"Judas' Son\\". Initially, the Scientology agents told DeWolf's mother that they were fellow poets, but DeWolf later remarked, \\"My mom knew from the moment they started talking that they were Scientologists, which they admitted to.\\" DeWolf was quoted as saying, \\"They can't shut me up.\\" In 2013 That same year he was quoted on The Young Turks as saying that Scientology is one of the most \\"devious, systematic brainwashing systems that's ever been invented.\\" Views on Scientology DeWolf is an outspoken critic of the Church of Scientology. Of his own views on Scientology and his great- grandfather, DeWolf remarked in the East Bay Express: \\"Scientology is the most brilliantly engineered pyramid scam I've ever seen. L. Ron Hubbard‚Äîyou can never say that he was an idiot, by any means. He was very intelligent, very sort of evil, malicious; a sort of overman, his will against the world.\\" In a January 25, 2013, interview with Cenk Uygur on Current TV, DeWolf said that Scientology In 2015, DeWolf incorporated his monthly show in a special game show aimed at Scientology, including 'a conversation with journalist Tony Ortega, who appeared in HBO's documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, and Paulette Cooper, author of The Scandal of Scientology.'

He was the mentor and elder brother of film director John Ford. He also appeared in many of the latter's movies, including Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) and The Quiet Man (1952).  Biography  Production still of the cast and crew of the Universal silent serial The Broken Coin (1915). Grace Cunard and Francis Ford are in the center on the throne, the young actress Gertrude Short is seated on the floor in front of Miss Cunard, and John Ford is third from the left. A cameraman, likely Harry McGuire Stanley, is sitting (front right) with a Path√© film camera between his feet. Francis Ford was born in Portland, Maine. He was the son of John Augustine Feeney, who was born in the village of Spiddal, County Galway, Ireland, on June 15, 1854. His mother was Barbara \\"Abbey\\" Curran. By 1878, John had moved to Portland, Maine, and opened a saloon, at 42 Center Street, that used a false front to pose as grocery store. John opened four others in following years. After service in the United States Army in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (In Pappy: The Life of John Ford, Dan Ford wrote about Francis Ford and the war, \\"The Army soon discovered that he was only fifteen and sent him home.\\"), Francis left home. He drifted into the film business in New York City, working for David Horsley, Al Christie and the Star Film Company's San Antonio operation under Gaston M√©li√®s. He adopted the name Ford from the automobile.Scott Eyman, Print the Legend, page 40 From San Antonio, Francis began his Hollywood career working for Thomas H. Ince at Ince's Bison studio, directing and appearing in westerns. Francis Ford's younger brother, John M. Feeney, nicknamed \\"Bull,\\" was a successful fullback and defensive tackle on a Portland High state championship football team. In 1914, \\"Bull\\" followed Francis to Hollywood, changed his name to John Ford and eventually surpassed his elder brother's considerable reputation. Francis Ford's son, Philip Ford, was also a film actor/director. Ford died after being diagnosed with cancer.  Work  Advertisement for A Study in Scarlet, directed by and starring Francis Ford, 1914 Universal post card, 1915 Ford may have acted in over 400 films, with many of his early credits poorly documented and probably lost. Ambitious and prolific, in Ford's early work he cast himself as George Armstrong Custer, Sherlock Holmes (with his younger brother as Dr. Watson) and Abraham Lincoln, a role in which he specialized. By 1912, Ford was directing alongside Thomas Ince. It rapidly became clear that Ince was routinely taking credit for Ford's work,Scott Eyman, Print the Legend, page 43 so Ford moved to Universal in early 1913. His 1913 Lucille Love, Girl of Mystery was Universal's first serial, and the first of a string of very popular serials starring Ford's collaborator and lover Grace Cunard. The 1915 serial The Broken Coin was expanded from 15 to 22 episodes by popular demand, probably the height of Ford's career. In 1917, Ford founded a short-lived independent company, Fordart Films, which released the 1918 Berlin via America with Phil Kelly, and briefly opened his own studio at Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. At the same time, Ford mentored his younger brother, collaborating frequently as writers, directors and actors in each other's projects, but as early as 1917, it was clear that John's star was on the rise. Frank's directorial style remained suitable for serials, but failed to evolve.Joseph McBride, Searching for John Ford, page 94 Ford's final known directoral credit is for the 1928 The Call of the Heart, a 50-minute vehicle for \\"Dynamite the Devil Dog\\". The Ford brothers were, at the best of times, critical of each other and sometimes sharply antagonistic. Ford wrote an unpublished memoir in 1934 called Up and Down the Ladder which is \\"filled with bitter and sometimes heartrending complaints about how old-timers who had helped create the industry had been shunted aside by younger men.\\"Joseph McBride, Searching for John Ford, pages 94‚Äì95 From the late 1920s, and for the next two decades, Ford sustained a career as a grizzled character actor and bit player. He is often uncredited, as in his appearance in James Whale's 1931 Frankenstein. Among his most memorable roles was that of the demented old man in The Ox-Bow Incident (1943).

Gonzales has since left the company and today the company continues under the ownership of Dwindle Distribution. The company produces decks, wheels, soft goods and accessories. The company's logo for many years was a stylized grim reaper. History1989‚Äì1993: Formation, Video Days, Gonzales departs= The name \\"Blind\\" was devised as an intentional slight to Gonzales's former sponsor, Vision Skateboards.16 THINGS: GONZ (16 Things You Didn‚Äôt Know About Mark Gonzales) by Kevin Craft (Skateboarder Magazine, 12 October 2005) Upon the brand's launch in 1989, Jason Lee moved from World Industries to Blind as its second professional rider (as founder, Gonzales was the team's first). Blind then signed Rudy Johnson and Guy Mariano, both from Powell Peralta, and Jordan Richter as its vert rider. Danny Way rode for the company for a very brief period of time, and a signature skateboard deck, featuring a pink-colored car, was designed and released for Way. Blind released its first video in 1991, entitled Video Days, which featured full-length parts from Gonzales, Mariano, Richter, Lee, and Johnson. The video was filmed and directed by Spike Jonze and is considered one of the most influential skateboarding videos of its era. While filming a second full-length video, Plan B director, Mike Ternasky reviewed progress footage and came to the conclusion that Tim Gavin and Henry Sanchez, also members of the Blind team, were the only two riders who had produced footage of a high enough quality‚Äîthe release of Tim and Henry's Pack of Lies followed in 1992. By 1993, the team had grown, with the formal inclusion of new professional riders, Gavin, Sanchez, Brian Lotti, and amateur skater, Jeron Wilson. Lotti, who formerly skated for Planet Earth (founded and owned by professional skateboarder Chris Miller), was recruited by Lee and filmed several tricks for the opening section of Tim and Henry's Pack of Lies. However, in a 2010 interview with the \\"chrome ball incident\\" blog, Lotti expressed regret in regard to his departure from Planet Earth, a company that he described as a \\"small and tight family\\": \\"I loved skating with everyone, but I wasn‚Äôt always psyched on the whole World Industries thing. I definitely felt at times like I blew it with Miller and wished I would have just stayed on Earth‚Ä¶ I was really involved there. I had a good thing going.\\" The company later signed Ronnie Creager from Foundation Skateboards. In late 1993, Johnson, Mariano, Gavin, and Wilson left Blind to join the newly formed Girl Skateboards, and Gonzales had also left by this time, along with Lee‚Äîthe latter proceeded to form Stereo Skateboards with Chris \\"Dune\\" Pastras, another sponsored skateboarder. Wilson later revealed in a January 2013 interview for the \\"Weekend Buzz\\" segment of the internet-based RIDE channel that a transfer tape of skateboard footage, originally filmed for a Blind video that was never produced, is in existence but has not been released by Socrates Leal (skateboard videographer)‚Äîfootage of Wilson and Mariano, among other skateboarders from the early 1990s, forms the tape's contents. =1994‚Äì2010: New recruits, What If?, 21st anniversary= During the early 1990s, Blind was one of the largest skateboard brands in the world, due to board sales and sales of Blind's jean products. During the 1990s and early/mid-2000s, additional team members, such as Kris Markovich, James Craig, Jake Duncombe, Jake Brown, Corey Shepard, Grant Patterson, Danny Cerezini, and Jani Laitala were recruited by brand manager Bill Weiss. Vert (skateboarding on a vertical \\"u\\"-shaped ramp) skateboarder Rob Loirifice was recruited to the team in 2008 and Cerezini was assigned professional status in the same year. The second full-length Blind video, What If?, premiered in early 2005, and featured parts from Creager, Markovich, Craig, Sheppard, Brown, Duncombe, Aaron Artis, Evan Schiefelbine, Patterson and Carlos Ruiz. The company's third video then premiered in 2009, and featured parts from Morgan Smith, Craig, Cerezini, Patterson, Brown, Lorifice, Creager, Filipe Ortiz, Duncombe and Laitiala. In 2010, the company celebrated its 21-year anniversary and returned to using the original logo. The company also began to reissue a series of boards from the early 1990s that were based on original shapes‚Äîreissued boards included Mariano, Way, Johnson, Gavin, and Sanchez designs. =2010‚Äìpresent: Damn ..., Creager departs, New professionals= Former Plan B rider, Sean Sheffey, Filipe Ortiz, Sewa Kroetkov, TJ Rogers, and Yuri Fachini were recruited to the Blind team in the latter half of the first decade of the 21st century. The company's amateur video, This Is Not A Test, was released in 2011, and focused upon team riders who were amateur at the time: Kroetkov, Kieran Reilley, Rogers, Smith, Ortiz and Kevin Romar. Cerezini was featured in the video as a \\"guest pro.\\" In an official statement released in April 2012, Brown's departure from the Blind team was announced and a comment from Weiss was included: \\"Jake Brown is one of the most dynamic, positive and genuine skateboarders I have ever met and been lucky enough to call my friend and I wish him nothing but the best on his next adventure. I cant wait to see what Jake‚Äôs got up his sleeve next.‚Äù (Brown had been a team member for eight years). Cerezini then parted ways with Blind in October 2012. In 2012, team members, Kevin Romar (who moved to the company in 2009This Week on ESPN Action (ESPN, 28 September 2009)) and Morgan Smith were both assigned professional status. On March 22, 2013, at the Tampa Pro contest in Tampa, Florida, US, Ortiz was presented with his inaugural Blind signature model skateboard deck to signify his introduction into the professional ranks of the company‚Äîthe graphic on the skateboard deck features a handcuffed mummy figure with the facial section of the bandages peeled away. Cody McEntire, a Texan skateboarder who was formerly a team member of the Think Skateboards brand, was recruited to the Blind team in March 2013. McEntire explained the process of joining the Blind team in a TransWorld Skateboarding \\"Roll Call\\" interview: > I‚Äôve known [Bill] Weiss [Blind brand manager] for a while because we worked > together on the Digital Smoke And Mirrors video. I was always stoked on how > down he was for skating. One day I called him and told him I was really > stoked on Blind and just wanted to see if anything would be possible with > it. A few weeks later we sat down and talked and it worked out. It was crazy > how fast it happened. I‚Äôm glad it all worked out because now I feel like I‚Äôm > exactly where I want to be. In April 2013, Duncombe left the company to ride for Life Extension (LE) Skateboards and announced the news on his Instagram profile: \\"Just want to thank everyone at blind for helping me out for all those years and putting up with my shit and to let everyone know LE is my new family!!!\\" A photograph of Duncombe with a bottle of beer that is above a forum post that reads \\"LE, where formerly great pros go to die\\" served as the official press release for LE. Duncombe later explained in December 2013: \\"There were a couple of times when I‚Äôd thought about quitting but didn‚Äôt due to loyalty. But at the end of the day new kids come in and older guys get let go.\\" The full-length video Damn ... was released on May 27, 2014, after more than two years of daily filming, and was co-directed by Weiss and English filmer Mike Manzoori. The video features Kevin Romar, Ronnie Creager, Yuri Facchini, Cody McEntire, Morgan Smith, TJ Rogers, Sewa Kroetkev, and Filipe Ortiz, and was filmed in numerous global cities, including Barcelona, Spain; Toronto, Canada; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Sacramento, U.S. The Blind brand released a new product line in early July 2013 and published a video advertisement on its YouTube channel on July 9, 2013. Under the heading \\"A damn good deal!\\", Blind promoted a new line of skateboard decks constructed from North American maple and resin glue with a retail price of US$29.95. In March 2014, longtime team rider Creager announced his departure from Blind after more than 20 years with the company. In the official press release, released on March 13, Blind stated: \\"We cant thank Ronnie enough for all his contributions,memories and fun times over the years. We wish Ronnie nothing but the best and look forward to seeing more amazing skating from him in the future.‚Äù As of September 28, 2014, Creager was not yet associated with a new skateboard deck sponsor. Rogers was assigned professional status in August 2014 after his \\"Recruit\\" video part was published on the Berrics website in late July. Blind released a limited edition skateboard deck, designed in collaboration with the Berrics, which were signed by Rogers. The decks sold out within their first day of availability. Blind released a two-part video on September 15, 2014, in which Facchini and Rogers were the only skateboarders featured. Manzoori was again enlisted for the project, entitled X2 Vision, and premieres were held in 18 cities internationally. Kroetkov was then assigned professional status in September 2014, during a team event at the Lafayette skate park in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on September 22. A \\"Subject\\" segment was published on the Berrics website the following day, in which new street-based footage of Sewa was featured. Team *Morgan Smith *Cody McEntire *Kevin Romar *T.J.

If the lengths of the sides are also equal (that is, if it is also equilateral) then it is a regular polygon. Isogonal polygons are equiangular polygons which alternate two edge lengths. Properties The only equiangular triangle is the equilateral triangle. Rectangles, including the square, are the only equiangular quadrilaterals (four-sided figures).. For a convex equiangular n-gon each internal angle is 180(1-2/n)¬∞; this is the equiangular polygon theorem. Viviani's theorem holds for equiangular polygons:Elias Abboud \\"On Viviani‚Äôs Theorem and its Extensions\\" pp. 2, 11 :The sum of distances from an interior point to the sides of an equiangular polygon does not depend on the location of the point, and is that polygon's invariant. A rectangle (equiangular quadrilateral) with integer side lengths may be tiled by unit squares, and an equiangular hexagon with integer side lengths may be tiled by unit equilateral triangles. Some but not all equilateral dodecagons may be tiled by a combination of unit squares and equilateral triangles; the rest may be tiled by these two shapes together with rhombi with 30 and 150 degree angles. A cyclic polygon is equiangular if and only if the alternate sides are equal (that is, sides 1, 3, 5, ... are equal and sides 2, 4, ... are equal). Thus if n is odd, a cyclic polygon is equiangular if and only if it is regular.De Villiers, Michael, \\"Equiangular cyclic and equilateral circumscribed polygons\\", Mathematical Gazette 95, March 2011, 102-107.

Based on student enrollment, Grand Canyon University was the largest Christian university in the world in 2018, with 20,000 attending students on campus and 70,000 online. Grand Canyon was established by the Arizona Southern Baptist Convention on August 1, 1949, in Prescott, Arizona, as Grand Canyon College. In 1999‚Äì2000, the university ended its affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention. Suffering financial and other difficulties in the early part of the 21st century, the school's trustees authorized its sale in January 2004 to California-based Significant Education, LLC,Tammi Reed Ledbetter, Grand Canyon Univ. sold; trustees in advisory role , Baptist Press, February 10, 2004, Accessed May 24, 2006 making it the first for-profit Christian college in the United States.Bob Smietana, Christian Ed That Pays Off , Christianity Today, May 19, 2005, Accessed May 11, 2006 Following that purchase, the university became the first and only for-profit to participate in NCAA Division I athletics. In 2018 the university received approval to return to non-profit status from its regional accreditor as well as the IRS and the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education. However, the U.S. Department of Education rejected the university's request to reclassify it as a non-profit and continues to classify the university as for- profit. The university operations partner directly alongside the for-profit publicly traded corporation, Grand Canyon Education, Inc. that bundles services for the university to operate. The university president, Brian Meuller, also serves as the CEO of Grand Canyon Education. The university offers various programs through its nine colleges including doctoral studies, business, education, fine arts and production, humanities and social sciences, nursing and health care professions, science, theology, engineering and technology. HistoryFounding= The college was founded as a nonprofit institution in 1949 in Prescott. Arizona Southern Baptists felt the need to establish a faith-based institution that would allow local Baptists the opportunity to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree without going east to one of the Baptist colleges in Texas or Oklahoma. On October 8, 1951, Grand Canyon College relocated to its current location in Phoenix. In 1984, the college's trustees voted to transition the college to a university for the 40th anniversary of the school in 1989, at which time it also changed governance from the Southern Baptist Convention to the GCU Board of Trustees. =Restructuring/conversion to for-profit= Suffering financial and other difficulties in the early part of the 21st century, the school's trustees authorized its sale in January 2004 to California-based Significant Education, LLC, making it the first for-profit Christian college in the United States. Significant Education traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol \\"LOPE.\\" After the infusion of capital, Grand Canyon University's size increased. After having fewer than 1,000 students enrolled in 2008, the university had 17,500 students in the spring of 2017. A 2015 economic impact study revealed that the university was adding about $1 billion into the state's economy each year during its expansion. In February 2017, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said that the neighborhoods surrounding the university have experienced a 30% increase in housing values while concurrently seeing a 30% decrease in crime rates. In 2008, the university was sued by the United States federal government for paying enrollment counselors according to how many students they had enrolled while at the same time accepting federal financial aid, a violation of the Department of Education's incentive compensation ban. GCU eventually reached a settlement in the case, and was forced to pay a 5.2 million dollar fine to a former employee and the federal government. Due to GCU's for-profit status, Arizona State University has refused to play against GCU in any sport, even though they are both NCAA Division I schools and located only 16 miles apart. =Attempts to return to non-profit status= In fall 2014 the school announced the exploration of a return to non-profit status. Grand Canyon's regional accreditation body, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), rejected the university's petition for conversion to non-profit status in 2016, stating that the school's proposed strategy, particularly its plan to outsource some of its activities (such as curriculum development and student support services) to outside vendors, did not meet the criteria for \\"such a conversion\\". In 2018, the university submitted another application to HLC to change to non-profit status. This second application was accepted on July 1, 2018. Although some organizations have approved this transition, the U.S. Department of Education still classifies the university as a for-profit university. The government specifically stated that GCU is a captive client to Grand Canyon Education, and the college is operating for the benefit of shareholders of a for-profit company. The university plans to challenge the department's ruling. Grand Canyon Education has also been accused of engaging in securities-law fraud with its relation to GCU. Grand Canyon University was alleged to switch from for-profit status to non-profit status due to its yearly $9.2 million property tax bill. Numerous school officials said this was unsustainable and was one of the key reasons a required switch from for-profit to non-profit status was made, to reduce that burden. Some critics of for- profit education still criticize that the relationship between GCU and Grand Canyon Education, Inc. is too intertwined. A former department of education official notes that no other university in the country has its CEO working for its contractor and itself. Brian Galle, Professor of Law at Georgetown Law, has written extensively about the relationship between the non-profit and for- profit entities and argues that because the non-profit is wholly dependent on the for-profit, the non-profit status should not be allowed. Campuses In 2006, the college spent US$150 million to renovate the campus, adding a brick promenade, an aquatics center, with pool and hot tub, and a caf√© offering an assortment of games and big-screen televisions. In 2009, Grand Canyon University's campus began work on a $60 million campus expansion project which includes a 500-bed dormitory, a fitness and recreation center, 125-classroom facility, food court and bowling alley, and a 5000-seat arena. The GCU Arena, which opened on September 2, 2011, is used for concerts, speakers, and other events. The arena is also home to the college's men's and women's basketball teams, and women's volleyball games. The arena was expanded to 7,000 seats with construction beginning in spring 2014 and concluding in August of the same year. Grand Canyon University offers several fast food restaurants, coffee shops, student union, cafeteria, video game room, and six-lane bowling alley for student recreation. In August 2016, the university announced it was establishing a campus police department employing a 177-member police force. In August 2016, GCU announced its 10 in 2 initiative, the building of 10 on- campus athletic facilities in a two-year span. Highlights of the project included brand new facilities for the university's soccer, baseball, softball, tennis and beach volleyball programs. It also included a sports medicine expansion, an equipment room expansion, practice facilities for the basketball and golf programs, and a student-athlete academic center. In August 2017, Grand Canyon's Phoenix campus was ranked as one of the 10 Best College Campuses Across America by Town & Country. Academics Grand Canyon University offers over 200 bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs through its nine colleges. * Colangelo College of Business * College of Education * College of Fine Arts and Production * College of Humanities, Social Sciences * College of Nursing and Health Care Professions * College of Science, Engineering, and Technology * College of Theology * College of Doctoral Studies * GCU Honors College In August 2016, the university announced that it was opening a seminary. In April 2017, Arizona nursing board officials censured GCU after the school's nursing programs fell below 80% graduation rate for two consecutive years. GCU said it would implement a plan to increase graduation rates. Three months later, the nursing board announced it was pleased with the \\"tremendous improvements\\" the university had shown to addressing all concerns. In 2018, Grand Canyon's nursing program was censured by the Arizona State Board of Nursing over test passage rates. The censure came due to the number of first-time students failing to pass the registered nursing exam and after numerous complaints by students and faculty. In the second quarter of 2018, Grand Canyon University's nursing students posted a 95.65 percent first-time pass rate on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). This leads to a year-to-date rate of 92.86 percent, which is higher than the Arizona Board of Nursing's year-to-date statewide average of 91.89. Grand Canyon University's academic workers include 335 full-time workers and more than 4200 adjunct faculty. GCU has a graduation rate of 41%, below the national average. Athletics Baseball game, Gonzaga University at GCU, February 19, 2016 Grand Canyon University is currently a member of NCAA Division I with most sports participating in the Western Athletic Conference. Men's Volleyball competes in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and Beach Volleyball competes independently. In March 2013, former Phoenix Suns shooting guard Dan Majerle was hired as the 13th men's basketball coach. Majerle oversaw GCU's transition into NCAA Division I basketball in the WAC. On August 23, 2017, the NCAA officially approved Grand Canyon's move to Division I, elevating the university to active membership status. GCU immediately became eligible for postseason competition. Rankings, recognition, statistics, and accreditation Grand Canyon University is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). According to the HLC, Grand Canyon College entered candidacy for accreditation in 1961. By 1968 the school was regionally accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and remains accredited, successfully renewing its 10-year comprehensive evaluation in 2017. GCU also holds additional accreditations from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), the Arizona State Board of Educations, and the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). The university teachers and administrator preparation programs are approved by the Arizona Department of Education. In autumn 2015, GCU admitted 58 percent of those applying. The freshman retention rate is 61 percent. U.S. News & World Report classifies the university among \\"National Universities\\", wherein it was classified in the 2017 Best Colleges as a Tier 2 institution (meaning its ranking placed it in the bottom 25 percent of institutions in its category).

History  After an unpublished mockup in 1963, the Cal became an annual publication from 1964. The Cal has been created by the British art director Derek Forsyth and is known for its limited availability, as it is only given as a corporate gift to a restricted number of Pirelli customers and celebrities. In some of the earlier calendars Pirelli tyres featured prominently, though this marketing aspect was later dropped. The first woman photographer to shoot the calendar was Sarah Moon in 1972. Publication was discontinued after the 1974 issue as an economizing cutback in response to the world recession from the oil shock. It was resurrected 10 years later and has been published regularly since then. Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli's CEO since 1992, commented that the purpose of the Cal is \\"to mark the passing of time\\" by recording the zeitgeist. The annual cost is about US$2 million. The calendar is produced with limited availability ( are printed annually). Copies do not go on sale, but are instead given as corporate gifts to celebrities and select Pirelli customers. For the first ten years of the calendar's existence it included photographs of fully clothed women, but an emphasis on nudity developed during the 1980s. From then until the mid-2010s the calendar featured mainly eroticised images, although in some instances the pictures taken by the photographers were considered by the editors to be too risqu√© to use. From the mid-2010s the calendar moved away from eroticism, and around this time diversity began to be addressed, with the 2018 calendar including only photographs of black models. The 1987 calendar, photographed by Terrence Donovan, was the first to feature only black models, included a bare-bottomed 16-year-old Naomi Campbell.https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/399483429416959113/ The models were photographed topless in Savannah-like settings and styled in tribal fashion. The 2008 calendar was photographed by Patrick Demarchelier in Shanghai and included a number of Asian models. At the same time a book, The Complete Works: The Pirelli Calendar 1964‚Äì2007, was published by Mondadori. The 2010 calendar, photographed by Terry Richardson, used similar imagery to that which was used in the calendar in the 1960s. In 2014 Pirelli released an unpublished calendar from 1986 shot by photographer Helmut Newton. A 50th anniversary book, Pirelli - The Calendar: 50 Years and More, was published by Taschen in 2015. The 2016 calendar, photographed by Annie Leibovitz, aimed to celebrate women for their accomplishments rather than their physical attributes. It included Fran Lebowitz, Mellody Hobson, Serena Williams, Yoko Ono and Patti Smith to represent inspiring women of diverse ages in almost entirely clothed portraits. The 2017 calendar was photographed by Peter Lindbergh and the women in the photographs were fully dressed and wore no makeup. It was the first calendar in which the photographs had not been retouched. The women photographed included Helen Mirren, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore. For the 2018 calendar, photographer Tim Walker chose to feature only black models, including Duckie Thot, Adwoa Aboah, RuPaul, Whoopi Goldberg, and Thando Hopa.  Models  Appearance in the calendar has become a mark of distinction for those photographic models who are chosen, as well as for the photographers commissioned to produce the images used. Between 1997 and 2015 casting director Jennifer Starr also influenced the look and direction of each calendar.

Ray spent the majority of his professional career with the Edmonton Eskimos and Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He also briefly spent time in the af2, as well as with the San Francisco 49ers and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). Ray is the Eskimos all-time leader in passing yardage, pass completions and passing touchdowns. He won the Grey Cup in 2003, 2005, 2012, and 2017. He formally announced his retirement from professional football on May 8, 2019. College career In 1997, Ray made his debut for Shasta College, a two-year community college in Redding, California. He became a first-team All-American and state player of the year in 1998. He also set several school records during his time at Shasta, most notably throwing 199 consecutive pass attempts without allowing an interception. On December 20, 2014, Ricky was inducted into the Shasta County Sports Hall Of Fame.Induction Ceremony Events & Information, Shasta County Sports Hall Of Fame websiteRay Headed To Shasta Sports Hall of Fame, KRCR-TV website, December 17, 2014 Ray moved on to play NCAA college football with Sacramento State University. In his first year as a college starter in 1999, Ray completed 179 of 291 passes for 2,422 yards and 20 touchdowns. He suffered a slight dropoff in 2000, completing 168 of 270 passes (62.2%) for 13 touchdowns with six interceptions. Ray holds the Sacramento State record for completion percentage (.619) and is third in completions and yards. Professional careerSan Francisco 49ers= After his college career ended in 2000, Ray, having gone undrafted by the NFL, attended training camp with the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, but did not make the team and only dressed for a single pre-season game. He earned the nickname \\"Frito Ray\\" by teammates, as he was working as a delivery driver for Frito-Lay chips when he was called up for training camp. =Fresno Frenzy= Ray made his professional debut with the Fresno Frenzy of the Arena Football League's developmental league af2. He played seven games for the Frenzy, where he was coached by former CFL quarterback Rick Worman. He completed 116 passes for 1,296 yards, 25 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.Highlights Worman was instrumental in arranging a tryout with the Eskimos. =Edmonton Eskimos= In 2002, Ray made the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos out of training camp. The Eskimos were considered one of the strongest teams in the West Division at the time. However, the Eskimos were deep at quarterback. Starter Jason Maas was considered one of the best at his position in the league. Ray started the season as the Eskimos' third-string quarterback. Late in the fourth quarter of a Week Four game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Maas was knocked out of the game, and would not be available for the Week Five matchup against the rival BC Lions. Ray made his debut relieving Maas in the Saskatchewan game and his first start against the Lions, throwing for four touchdowns. Ray threw for 2,991 yards, 24 touchdowns, and nine interceptions with a quarterback rating of 101.3, highest in the league. With Maas still recovering from injury, Ray led the Eskimos to the Grey Cup game against Montr√©al. Ray threw for 324 yards, but the Eskimos lost the 90th Grey Cup to the Alouettes 26-16 at home. Ray failed to convert on a vital two-point conversion late in the game that could have tied the affair at 18‚Äì18. The failure forced the Eskimos into an onside kick attempt, which failed as Montr√©al returned it for a touchdown and took a lead that they would not lose. During the year, Ray received Offensive Player of the Week and Month honours, but was ineligible for the Offensive Rookie of the Year award, due to his brief NFL experience. Maas returned for the 2003 season, setting up a quarterback duel between Maas and Ray during training camp. However, Maas sustained a back injury during the off-season, a condition that would require surgery. Ray remained the starter even after Maas returned. Ray, despite splitting time early in the year, he ended up with a 67.6 completion percentage, 4,640 yards, 35 touchdowns and 13 interceptions and was a candidate for the Most Outstanding Player award. The Eskimos rebounded from their slow start and made the playoffs, defeating the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Western final as Ray threw for 356 yards. The 91st Grey Cup in Regina, Saskatchewan featured the Eskimos against the Alouettes. The Eskimos defeated the Alouettes 34‚Äì22, for the team's first Grey Cup in a decade. Ray played exceptionally against Alouettes coach Don Matthews's renowned blitzing defense, completing 22 of 32 passes for 301 yards and two touchdowns. =New York Jets= After two years in Canada, Ray began to look south of the border. Former Eskimo Warren Moon, a legend in the NFL and CFL, advised Ray to stay in the CFL a little while longer to improve as a quarterback and receive a better shot at a starting job. But the lure of the league he had dreamed of in his youth proved too strong to keep Ray in Canada, and he signed with the New York Jets. In the 2004 NFL season, Ray dressed for six games with the Jets. When starter Chad Pennington went down briefly with a rotator cuff injury, backup Quincy Carter came in and played well, relegating Ray to the bench. After the season concluded, Ray asked for his release by the Jets. Ray subsequently returned to the Eskimos. =Return to the Eskimos= Ray's return was accompanied by controversy. He became the favourite to take the starting job in Edmonton, but, once again, the team was deep at quarterback in 2005. In addition to Ray, Maas remained in Edmonton. While Ray had been in the NFL, Maas had been the starter and had played superbly, becoming only the second Eskimo to pass for 5,000 yards in a single season. Ray received the starting job out of training camp in 2005. Maas, despite frequent trade rumours, was once again made his backup. Jason Johnson remained on the roster as the third quarterback. Ray started the 2005 season strongly, leading the league in completions and yardage. He set a pro football record with 479 completions in 2005. However, towards the end of the year, Ray's play faltered, concluding in him not throwing a touchdown in the season's last four games. In the playoffs, Ray was benched twice more, both in the West Semi- Final against Calgary and the West Final against British Columbia, and both times Maas came on the field, threw very well, and recorded the winning points. Head coach Danny Maciocia, however, promised Ray the start in the 93rd Grey Cup, perhaps because of rumours that a trade of Maas to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats had already been arranged. This time, however, Ray seized the opportunity presented to him, throwing for 359 yards and two touchdowns while completing 35 of 45 passes. The Eskimos defeated their old foes the Montr√©al Alouettes in a thrilling shootout victory, and Ray was named most valuable player of the Grey Cup. In 2005, with Ray leading the Eskimos again, the Eskimos and Alouettes met in the Grey Cup game for the third time in four years. Once again, the Eskimos were victorious in the rubber match, winning in overtime, 38‚Äì35, after an ill-advised move by the Montreal quarterback, Anthony Calvillo took a penalty by throwing the ball twice on the same play, and then getting sacked by Charles Alston.CFL Grey Cup Live Commentary This decision put Montreal in a 3rd and 30 situation, and handed Edmonton their 13th Grey Cup Championship. Ray was named Grey Cup MVP for his performance. In 2006, Ray started for the Eskimos for every single game of the season, led the league in passing with exactly 5,000 yards, and was near the top in completion percentage at 65.7%, 21 touchdowns, and a passer rating of 89.8. Ray (15) dropping back to pass against the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2007. On September 14, 2007, in a win against the Montreal Alouettes, Ray surpassed CFL and NFL hall-of-famer Warren Moon to capture the Eskimos' all-time record for career passing yards.CFL.ca Network :: Official site of the Canadian Football League On September 28, 2007, he suffered a separated shoulder at the hands of Toronto Argonauts safety Willie Pile, ending his season.edmontonsun.com - Football - Ricky won't be cut Without Ray, the Eskimos lost their remaining five games and missed the playoffs for the second consecutive season. In 2008, Ray completed 422 of 608 pass attempts (69.8% completion) for a league- leading, career-best, and single-season Eskimo record 5,661 yards. Ray threw for 26 touchdowns and 17 interceptions for a 101.8 quarterback rating. Ray also scrambled for 258 yards and 5 touchdowns. One of his best games of the season came in the final week of the season vs. the Alouettes when Ray broke the record for highest completion percentage in a single game (with a minimum of 20 passing attempts) when he went 23 of 25 for 92.0% for 302 yards and 2 touchdowns in only 3 quarters of play. He led the Esks to a win in the crossover playoff game in Winnipeg, but the team lost in the East finals to Montreal. The 2008 Eskimos were the first team to ever win a crossover game. In 2009, Ray completed 401 of 596 pass attempts (67.3% completion) for a league leading 4,916 yards, 22 touchdowns and 12 interceptions for a 96.4 quarterback rating. Ray scrambled for 206 yards and 6 touchdowns. In a game versus the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Ray completed 20 consecutive passes before receiver Jamaica Rector dropped a pass, ending the streak. This remarkable performance left Ray 2nd all time behind teammate Jason Maas (who completed 22 straight passes on July 30, 2004), in the CFL record books for most consecutive pass completions in a single game. In 2010, Ray completed 288 of 447 pass attempts (64.4% completion) for 3,565 yards, 11 touchdowns and 16 interceptions for an 82.3 quarterback rating. Additionally, Ray scrambled for 302 yards and three touchdowns. In Game 15, Ray had a career rushing performance, compiling 135 yards on 12 rushes and a touchdown. He started 16 of the 18 games. Statistically, it was the worst year of his career. In 2011, Ray completed 343 of 526 pass attempts (65.2% completion) for 4,954 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for a 99.3 quarterback rating. Additionally, Ray scrambled for 258 yards and 1 touchdown. Ricky Ray had a bounce back season after struggling in 2010. His solid play earned him Offensive Player of the month for the month of September. Ray lead the Eskimos to a record of 11‚Äì7, qualifying for the Playoffs. =Toronto Argonauts= Ray was traded to the Toronto Argonauts on December 12, 2011, for quarterback Steven Jyles, placekicker Grant Shaw, and a 2012 first round draft pick.http://www.esks.com/article/eskimos-and-argos-swing-major-trade Eskimos and Argos swing major trade Ray went on to win the 100th Grey Cup as the Argonauts' starting quarterback.

Ray had a streak of 222 consecutive pass attempts without throwing an interception to begin the year, going back to the previous year the streak was 247 pass attempts,http://forums.bluebombers.com/index.php?topic=37023.0 before throwing his first interception on his last pass of a game in Week 16 against Hamilton. This figure is possibly a CFL record as the Argo team itself set a league record for most consecutive passes without an interception by a team.https://www.cfl.ca/article/2013-cflca-game-notes-a-look-at-week-8 Ray finished the year with a record passer efficiency rating of 126.37, surpassing the previous pro football record of 122.46 set by Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and the CFL record of 118.77 set by Dave Dickenson in 2005. On July 19, 2013, Ray completed 19 of 20 passes against Winnipeg setting a new single game CFL and pro football completion percentage record of 95.0%, beating the previous record of 94.74% set by Alex Smith in 2012, his own CFL record of 92.0% set in 2008 and the Argos team record of 87.1% set by Condredge Holloway in 1985.http://argonauts.ca/article/qb-ricky-ray-sets-new-cfl-record-for-single- game-completion-percentage In the same game, he tied the Argo record for most consecutive pass completions held by Mike Rae with 17.http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/ricky-ray-throws-3-tds-as-argonauts- hold-off-eskimos-1.1312282 Only to surpass that mark in his final game of the season against Winnipeg.

Ricky Ray played in all but 1 of the 18 regular season games during the 2014 CFL season, however the Argos were unable to qualify for the postseason, finishing with a record of 8‚Äì10. Ray had one of his highest volume seasons as a passing quarterback in his career during the 2014 campaign. His 425 pass completions was the second highest of his career, trailing only his 2003 season with the Eskimos when he completed 479 passes. Ray attempted 620 passes over the course of the season, which was the 4th most attempts in his career, and the most since 2008. He racked up a league-leading 4,595 passing yards, which his most yards in a season since 2009. In November 2014, following the conclusion of the Argos season, Ray had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right (throwing) shoulder and a small tear in his right rotator cuff. The recovery time for the surgery was estimated to be around six months, which would allow Ray to return action in time for CFL training camp in the spring of 2015. However, Ray's recovery went slower than expected: As a result, the Argos placed Ray on the six-game injured list during the preseason. Ray missed the first 16 games of the 2015 CFL season, making his first start of the season in Week 19 against the BC Lions. At the time of his return, the Argos were 8‚Äì8, having clinched a playoff berth, they were fighting for a home playoff game (which they lost when they were defeated by the Lions). Ray played in the final regular season game and also the Eastern Semi-Final against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. In the playoff game Ray completed 22 of 34 pass attempts for 220 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception; however Justin Medlock kicked a 47-yard field goal with no time on the clock to eliminate the Argos, thus ending their season. On December 3, 2015, Ray and the Argos agreed on a contract extension; preventing him from becoming a free-agent in February 2015. Entering the 2016 season Ray was finally 100% healed from his shoulder injury which had plagued him since November 2014. Ray started the first five games of the season before sustaining a knee injury as defensive lineman Vaughn Martin rolled up into him in the third quarter. Following the game Ricky Ray was diagnosed with an sprained MCL, and was expected to miss between three and six weeks. Ray missed three games over the following five weeks before returning to play in the Labour Day weekend games against the BC Lions and Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Following their Labour Day game against the Tiger- Cats, reports surfaced suggesting Ray would miss the remainder of the 2016 CFL season with a punctured lung. The following day, it was announced that Ray would miss between four and six weeks with a partially deflated lung. This was Ray's second significant injury in 2016 and he has only played one full season since 2011. After missing six weeks recovering from a partially deflated lung Ray returned to the starting lineup in Week 18 of the regular season. However, he was unable to best the league-leading Stampeders and as a result the Argos were eliminated from playoff contention, falling to a record of 5‚Äì12. On February 28, 2017, at his introductory press conference, newly appointed head coach Marc Trestman declared Ray the Argos starting quarterback for the 2017 season: Despite Ray having only started 12 games over the previous two seasons. In the opening game of the season, Ray threw for a career-high 506 yards in a 32-15 win over the rival Tiger-Cats. On July 29, 2017, Ray surpassed Condredge Holloway to become the franchise leader in passing yards. Holloway threw for 16,616 yards between 1981 and 1986. On August 19, 2017, Ray became the Argonauts' all-time passing touchdown leader with his 99th touchdown pass, surpassing Holloway's 98. In that same game, he threw for his 100th touchdown pass as an Argonaut, becoming the first player in CFL history to throw at least 100 touchdown passes for two franchises. On October 21, 2017, Ray reached the 60,000 career passing-yard mark, becoming just the fourth player in CFL history to accomplish the milestone. In that same game, he also hit 5,000 passing yards for the season, joining Doug Flutie and Anthony Calvillo as the only players to pass for 5,000 yards at least four times in their careers. That game also marked the 12th time he eclipsed the 300-yard mark that season, which is an Argonauts record. The Argonauts finished the season 1st in the East with a 9-9 record, the only .500 team in the division. For his performance, Ray finished as runner-up to Edmonton quarterback Mike Reilly for the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. He would go on and win his fourth Grey Cup against the Calgary Stampeders in the 105th Grey Cup game. One day after the Argos Grey Cup parade, Ray conveyed to reporters that he was \\"seriously considering retirement\\". Ray, 38 years of age, who was a pending free agent for the 2018 season, said there was no timetable for a decision. On February 2, 2018 Ray and the Argos agreed to a one-year contract extension. Ray was carted off the field in the second half of the Argos Week 2 loss to the Calgary Stampeders after being awkwardly tackled between a pair of Stampeder defensive linemen. Ray was hospitalized, and the following day the team confirmed that Ray did indeed have feeling in all of his extremities. Given his age (38), and the severity of the injury, Ray's future as a quarterback was placed in doubt. Only a couple days later team doctors advised Ray to not play again in 2018. On September 24, 2018 Head Coach Marc Trestman confirmed that Ray would not return to the Argos for the 2018 season. In early November 2018 Ray was still considering his options, leaving the door open for a possible return in 2019. By early March Ray had not informed the Argos of his intentions for the 2019 season, and still needed to be cleared by doctors before returning to the field. General manager Jim Popp hinted that if Ray were to return to the Argos it would be as a backup quarterback, possibly transitioning to a coaching role in the future. On May 8, 2019 Ray held a press conference to officially announce his retirement. = CFL statistics = { BORDER=\\"0\\" CELLPADDING=\\"2\\" CELLSPACING=\\"0\\" width=\\"65%\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"9\\"  Passing ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Rushing - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Career She was born in Kankakee, one of two children to Maud (n√©e Reed) and John Kahler, a German-American butcher turned chiropractor. After her parents separated, her mother moved the family to California, where she married a grocer two years later, and changed their name to Kennedy. At the outbreak of World War I, their mother prepped seven-year-old Merna and brother Melvin (known as Merle) to tour as a dancing and singing sibling act on the Orpheum and Pantages theater circuits of vaudeville, where she became acquainted with Lita Grey. Merle broke his leg ending the duo, prompting Grey to suggest silent films to Merna. Kennedy was best known during her brief career for her role opposite Charlie Chaplin in the silent film The Circus (1928). A role she was brought to the attention of Chaplin for by her friend Lita Grey, who became Chaplin's second wife in 1924. As a dancer she had muscular legs, which helped her gain the role of the circus bareback rider. Kennedy continued acting after The Circus, starring in early sound films, but retired in 1934 when she married choreographer/director Busby Berkeley on February 10, 1934 at Hollywood United Methodist Church. Their marriage broke up by 1936. Kennedy died at age 36 of a heart attack on December 20,1944, four days after her marriage to Master Sergeant Forrest Brayton.

The location is west of Kingston upon Hull, approximately 20 miles (32 km) south of Youlthorpe and 25 miles (40 km) south-west of Beswick. History Faxfleet was one of Yorkshire's greatest preceptories, originally built upon land provided in 1185 by the Crusader knight, Roger de Mowbray, Lord of Northumberland. De Mowbray had been ransomed by the Templars from the Turks who were holding him prisoner. In that year it is recorded that Odo, Serlo, Gille, Stephen, Harvat and Ucca were Templars tenants, each farming of land under the strip farming system. In 1290 Geoffrey Jolif was preceptor, or commander, of the Knights Templar at Faxfleet (until 1301) and Robert de Halton was master of the bailiwick of the Temple in the same county. In 1308, several persons, although not Jolif, were arrested at Faxfleet, were sent to York, and were eventually sentenced to do penitence in the Cistercian Order.

History The area is thought to have long been inhabited by the Tush, a subgroup of Georgians, which themselves divide into two groups- the Chaghma- Tush (Georgian name, used for Tush who speak the local Georgian dialect) and Tsova-Tush (Nakh-speaking Tush, better known as Bats or Batsbi). It is uncertain whether ethnic Georgians were there first or whether Bats were.The Red Book of Peoples of the Russian Empire; Bats section. Available online: http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/bats.shtml There are two major theories on the origins of the Bats (with various variations). One is that the Bats are the remnant of a larger Nakh-speaking people. Jaimoukha speculates that they may be descended from the Kakh, a historical people living in Kakheti and Tusheti (who apparently called themselves Kabatsa).Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Routledge Curzon: Oxon, 2005. Page 29 However, the belief that the Kakh were originally Nakh is not widely held. The Georgian name for the Bats, the Tsova-Tush, may also (or instead) be linked to the Tsov, a historical Nakh people claimed by the Georgian historian Melikishvilli to have ruled over the Kingdom of Sophene in Urartu (called Tsobena in Georgian) who were apparently forcefully moved to the region around Erebuni, a region linked to Nakh peoples by place names and various historiography.–î–∂–∞–≤–∞—Ö–∏—à–≤–∏–ª–∏ –ò. –ê. –í–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é –≥—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞. –∫–Ω.1, –¢–±–∏–ª–∏—Å–∏, 1950, page.47-49–ì–∞–¥–∂–∏–µ–≤–∞ –í. –ì. –°–æ—á–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ò. –ì–µ—Ä–±–µ—Ä–∞ –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω –∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –º–µ–∂–¥—É –ê—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–Ω—å—é –∏ —Ä–µ–∫–æ—é –ö—É—Ä–æ–π –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥—è—â–∏—Ö—Å—è, –ú, 1979, page.55. However, theories linking the Bats to Transcaucasian peoples are not universally accepted (see below). The second theory has it that the Batsbi crossed the Greater Caucasus range from Ingusheti in the seventeenth century and eventually settled in Tusheti,NICHOLS, Johanna, \\"The Origin of the Chechen and Ingush: A Study in Alpine Linguistic and Ethnic Geography\\", Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 46, No. 2, 2004.15 and 20(c) in ALLEN, W.E.D. (Ed.), Russian Embassies to the Georgian Kings ‚Äì 1589‚Äì1605, The Hakluyt Society, Second Series No. CXXXVIII, Cambridge University Press, 1970 and that they are therefore a tribe of Ingush origin which was Christianized and \\"Georgianized\\" over the centuries. King Levan of Kakheti (1520‚Äì1574) apparently granted the Bats official ownership of the lands in the Alvani Valley in exchange for their military service. Bats- speaking inhabitants of Tusheti are known to the local Georgians as the Tsova- Tushs, they have a high degree of assimilation and are typically bilingual using both Georgian and their own Bats languages. Nowadays, Bats is spoken only in a village Zemo Alvani. Anthropological studies on the Tsova-Tush found them to be somewhere in between the Chechen-origin Kists and the Chaghma-Tush of the region, but significantly closer to the Chaghma-Tush. Dartlo Village, Tusheti The Bats have considered themselves Georgian by nation for a long period of time, and have been speaking Georgian for a while as well.Johanna Nichols, ibid. The process of assimilation of the Bats continues, but many Bats have held on to their language and spoken Georgian as well, accounting for the massive Georgian influence on their language. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians. Pagan Georgians from Pkhovi took refuge in the uninhabited mountains during their rebellion against Christianization implemented by the Iberian king Mirian III in the 330s. Subsequently, they were forcibly converted to Christianity and subdued by the Georgian kings. Regarding the relationship between the Nakh (Tsova) and Georgian (Chaghma) Tushians, the \\"Red Book\\", states the following: > For centuries there have been two communities next to each other in Tusheti, > one speaking the Nakh language, the other Old Georgian. The general name for > them is tush, according to their language either Tsova- or Chagma-Tushian. > They formed one single material and intellectual unit with Old Georgian > elements prevailing. > > The descendants of the Old Georgian pagan tribes, whose ancestors had fled > from Christianity to Tusheti, are regarded as Tushians. In the mountains > some of the fugitives splintered off from other Old Georgian tribes. They > were in close contact with the Nakh tribes which resulted in a new > linguistic unit. After the collapse of the unified Georgian monarchy, Tusheti came under the rule of Kakhetian kings in the fifteenth century. Many Tush families began to move southwards from Tusheti during the first half of the nineteenth century and settled in the low-lying fields of Alvan at the western end of Kakheti. (Alvan had already belonged to the Tush as a wintering-ground for their flocks for centuries; it was bequeathed to them in the seventeenth century in recognition of their valuable assistance in defeating a Persian army at the Battle of Bakhtrioni in 1659: Like a rushing stream did the Toushines make their way into the fortress, while the first rays of the rising sun were falling upon the grim old fortifications. The Tartars, half asleep, ran out into a field, but in vain for now they were met by the Pchaves and Khevsoures, who had ventured out from the gorge of Pankisse. The Tartars, surrounded on all sides, were exterminated to the last.GOULBAT, A., \\"The Tale of Zesva\\", in Caucasian Legends, translated from the Russian of A. Goulbat by Sergei de Wesselitsky-Bojidarovitch, New York: Hinds, Noble and Eldredge, 1904) The first to move were the Bats people following the destruction of one of their most important villages by a landslide in c.1830 and an outbreak of the plague.TOPCHISHVILI, Prof. Roland, The Tsova-Tushs (the Batsbs), article published with funding from the University of Frankfurt's ECLING project The Tush of the Chaghma, Pirikiti and Gometsari communities followed later. Many of these families practiced a semi-nomadic way of life, the men spending the summer with the flocks of sheep high up in the mountains between April and October, and wintering their flocks in Kakheti. During the German invasion of Soviet Union, a minor anti-Soviet revolt took place in the area in 1942-1943, seemingly linked to the similar but more large-scale events in the neighbouring Ingushetia. Culture Traditionally, the Tushs are sheep herders. Tushetian Guda cheese and high quality wool was famous and was exported to Europe and Russia. Even today sheep and cattle breeding is the leading branch of the economy of highland Tusheti. The local shepherds spend the summer months in the highland areas of Tusheti but live in the lowland villages of Zemo Alvani and Kvemo Alvani in wintertime. Their customs and traditions are similar to those of other eastern Georgian mountaineers (see Khevsureti). One of the most ecologically unspoiled regions in the Caucasus, Tusheti is a popular mountain trekking venue. Pork is considered taboo in Tusheti. Farmers will not raise pigs and travelers are usually advised to not bring any pork into the region. Locals will however eat pork themselves when not in Tusheti. Historical population figures Figures from the Russian imperial census of 1873 given in Dr. Gustav Radde's Die Chews'uren und ihr Land ‚Äî ein monographischer Versuch untersucht im Sommer 1876 (published by Cassel in 1878) divide the villages of Tusheti into eight communities:For detailed tables, go to this page on Batsav.com * the Parsma community: 7 villages, 133 households, consisting of 290 men and 260 women, totalling 550 souls * the Dartlo community: 6 villages, 143 households, consisting of 251 men and 275 women, totalling 526 souls * the Omalo community: 7 villages, 143 households, consisting of 354 men and 362 women, totalling 716 souls * the Natsikhv√°ri community: 8 villages, 116 households, consisting of 282 men and 293 women, totalling 575 souls * the Djvar-Boseli community: 10 villages, 116 households, consisting of 270 men and 295 women, totalling 565 souls * the Indurta community: 1 village, 191 households, consisting of 413 men and 396 women, totalling 809 souls * the Sagirta community: 3 villages, 153 households, consisting of 372 men and 345 women, totalling 717 souls * the Ili√∫rta community: 8 villages, 136 households, consisting of 316 men and 329 women, totalling 645 souls 1873 TOTAL: 50 villages, 1,131 households, consisting of 2,548 men and 2,555 women, in all 5,103 souls.

His The Squared-Circle Cancellations of Canada received its third edition shortly after his death. Whitehead's music is tonal and sometimes modal; his output of motets and anthems was extensive and he took particular pride in the anthems Alleluia, Sing to Jesus (with organ accompaniment),Ye Choirs of New Jerusalem, Now God Be with Us, and O Light Beyond Our Utmost Light, the short motets Bread of the World, Grant Us Grace, and Almighty God, Whose Glory. Leo Sowerby, a leading American cathedral organist-composer, described Whitehead's Benedicite, based on the Gregorian Tonus peregrinus, as the \\"best Benedicite\\" he knew. Whitehead's eight-part motets Watch Thou, Dear Lord (words by St Augustine) and Love Unknown, the Brahmsian organ Prelude on Irby, and his many short carols for Christmas, are also noteworthy. Early life and education Whitehead was born in Peterborough, England, where he received his early musical education as an articled pupil of Peterborough Cathedral organists Haydn Keeton and C. C. Francis. He studied in London with organist and theorist A. Eaglefield Hull at the Royal College of Music, earning an Associateship in 1910. In 1912, he emigrated to Canada, and in 1913 was the first person to earn the Fellowship of the Canadian Guild of Organists (FCGO), from the organization now known as the Royal Canadian College of Organists. Then, by successful examination and submission of composition exercises, he earned the external Bachelor of Music of the University of Toronto in 1916, and Doctor of Music of McGill University in 1922. Career From 1913 to 1915, Whitehead was both organist-choirmaster of St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Truro, Nova Scotia and instructor of organ and music theory at Mount Allison University . From 1915 to 1923, he was organist-choirmaster of St Peter's Anglican Church, Sherbrooke and privately taught piano, organ and theory; one student there was the composer Allan McIver. From 1922 through 1947, Whitehead was organist-choirmaster of Christ Church Cathedral. There he \\"became the acknowledged leader of Montreal's Protestant church music scene.\\" In 1936, Wilfrid Pelletier invited Whitehead's Cathedral Singers to perform with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra for the opening of the very first Montreal Festivals. Thereafter, Whitehead prepared the festival choruses for performances of Johann Sebastian Bach's St Matthew Passion and Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Bach's Mass in B Minor, Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem, and Beethoven's Missa solemnis. From 1922 to 1930, Whitehead taught organ, theory, and composition at McGill University's music faculty. He was twice elected president of the RCCO (1930-1931, 1935-1937). Later, the college named him honorary vice-president (1971‚Äì1973) and honorary president (1973-1974). From 1947 to 1953, he was head of Mount Allison University's music department. His notable pupils include Alexander Brott, Graham George, Hector Gratton, Frances James, and Ethel Stark. On retiring from Mount Allison, he was organist-choirmaster (1953 to 1971) of Trinity-St. Stephen's United Church, Amherst, Nova Scotia. He died in Amherst in 1974, at the age of 86. The Library and Archives Canada holds many of his papers and original manuscripts as well as a large portion of his private library. He is listed as an Associate Composer of the Canadian Music Centre.

The X-50A built upon the work of the Sikorsky S-72 X-Wing program of the 1980s by designing the vehicle as a multi-mode aircraft from the ground up. The X-50A was one of two projects funded by DARPA in its \\"Heliplane\\" program. Neither of the two prototype aircraft ever successfully transitioned to full forward flight. DARPA withdrew funding for the X-50 program in late 2006 due to inherent design flaws. Development Boeing initially proposed using the CRW configuration to fill a requirement for a VTOL aircraft suitable for escorting the V-22 tiltrotor. The X-50A was a joint program between Boeing and DARPA, with each paying for half the development costs. The X-50A was powered by a single conventional turbofan engine. For rotary-wing mode, the engine's exhaust was diverted to nozzles in the tips of the rotor blades. When the aircraft transitioned to full forward flight, the engine exhaust was directed through a nozzle at the rear of the aircraft and the rotor was locked into a fixed position and functioned as a conventional wing.McKenna, James T. \\"One Step Beyond\\", Rotor & Wing, February, 2007, page 54 Two proof-of-concept aircraft were built as part of the program.

Design The X-50 had a \\"canard\\" foreplane as well as a conventional tailplane, allowing both to contribute lift during forward flight and to offload the main rotor wing. For vertical take-off, hovering, low-speed flight, and vertical landing, the main rotor wing was driven by tip jets, by directing the exhaust from a jet engine through thrust nozzles in the rotor tips. Because the rotor is driven directly by jet thrust, there is no need for a tail rotor to control torque as in a conventional helicopter. For high-speed forward flight, the exhaust is redirected through an ordinary jet nozzle and the rotor wing is stopped and held in a fixed position, as in a conventional airplane. OperationCrashes= During the third flight of the prototype X-50A, on 23 March 2004, the vehicle crashed, as a result of cross-coupling in the controls. A second, improved prototype (\\"Ship 2\\") was then built. On its sixth of 11 planned test flights, Ship 2 was completely destroyed in a crash at the Yuma Proving Grounds on April 12, 2006. Subsequent investigation revealed that the aircraft's fuselage was subject to an aerodynamic pitching moment of extreme sensitivity. Both airspeed and rotor wake would produce a nose-up pitching motion that was greater than the flight controls could compensate for. =Outcome= Neither aircraft was able to achieve transition to full forward flight mode during the portions of the test flight program that were completed. In September, 2006, DARPA recognized the inherent design flaws and withdrew funding for the program.

The railroad also operated a small branch to Mt. Carmel Cemetery in Hillside and owned a branch line to Westchester. Wounded by the increased use of automobiles after World War II, the CA&E; abruptly ended passenger service in 1957. Freight service was suspended in 1959, and the railroad was officially abandoned in 1961. Most of the right-of-way has since been converted to the Illinois Prairie Path rail trail. The Aurora Elgin and Chicago RailwayOrigin (1899‚Äì1901)= The first known attempt to create an electric railway between the metropolis of Chicago and the Fox Valley settlement of Aurora was in late 1891. By this time, passengers in Aurora and Elgin were served by steam engines. Elgin was served by the Milwaukee Road. Geneva and West Chicago served by the Chicago and North Western Railway. St. Charles served by The Chicago and Great Western. And, Aurora was served by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CB&Q;). However, it was thought that an electric line would greatly facilitate interurban travel, as there would be no freight trains to slow passenger trains. A group of investors founded the Chicago & Aurora Interurban Railway with a $1 million investment. However, the railroad was unable to secure additional funds; it failed to meet an 1893 construction deadline and effectively ceased operation thereafter. A second attempt came two years later with the Chicago, Elgin & Aurora Electric Railway. Plans called for the railroad to run through Turner (now West Chicago), Wheaton, and Glen Ellyn. Like its predecessor, the railroad failed to acquire the necessary funds for construction. Yet another group incorporated the DuPage Interurban Electric Railway in 1897, but was met with a similar fate. Small electric lines opened in the 1890s that connected the municipalities of the Fox River Valley. A profitable streetcar railway stretched from Aurora north to Carpentersville. The success of this railway inspired investors to again attempt an electric connection to Chicago. A group led by F. Mahler, E. W. Moore, Henry A. Everett, Edward Dickinson, and Elmer Barrett formed independent railway lines that were projected to stretch from Aurora and Elgin to Chicago. These two companies were incorporated on February 24, 1899. The Everett-Moore group was Ohio's largest interurban railroad company and had experience administrating several lines around Cleveland, most notably the Lake Shore Electric Railway. These two companies, the Aurora, Wheaton & Chicago Railway and Elgin & Chicago Railway, were incorporated on February 24, 1899. Only one day after their founding, a second group of Cleveland-based investors, led by the Pomeroy- Mandelbaum group, incorporated the Aurora, Wheaton, & Chicago Railroad Company. Pomeroy-Mandelbaum was the second largest interurban railway company in Ohio and intended to compete against the Everett-Moore group. A meeting between the Everett-Moore syndicate and Pomeroy-Mandelbaum group occurred in either 1900 or 1901 to discuss the future of the two companies. They came to an agreement: Everett-Moore would build and maintain the railways connecting Aurora to Chicago while the Pomeroy-Mandelbaum group would control railways linking cities in the Fox River Valley (eventually consolidating as the Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company [AE&FRE;]). A third railway, the Batavia & Eastern Railway Company, was incorporated by the Everett-Moore group in 1901 to link the town of Batavia to the Aurora line. On March 12, 1901, all of the previously incorporated Everett-Moore companies were merged into one, renamed the Aurora, Elgin & Chicago Railway Company (AE&C;). Three million dollars' worth of bonds were issued in 1901 to support track construction. =Construction (1901‚Äì1902)= Construction commenced on September 18, 1900, when the AE&C; started to grade its right-of-way. The AE&C; received permission to cross existing track lines in February 1902, alleviating one of the largest obstacles in the railway's construction. Construction escalated following the winter months; by April, the third rail had been completed between Aurora and Wheaton. Later that month, the railway connected to the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad at 52nd Avenue (modern day Laramie Avenue) in Chicago. The company operated steam locomotives on completed portions to deliver construction goods to where they were needed. Wheaton was selected as the site of the railroad's headquarters, car barn, and machine shop. $1.5 million in preferred stock was issued in April 1902 to cover unexpected costs. The AE&C; station at Lombard (left), pictured in 1902. The station doubled as an electrical substation. AE&C; purchased a lot south of Batavia and constructed a power station to provide electricity. Commercial electric power was not yet available at the time, so the railroad needed to provide its own power for the third rail. Steam boilers were fed with coal provided by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. On April 11, 1902, they signed a contract with General Electric to provide electrical generators, transformers, and converters for the powerhouse. The line completed a network of utility poles through the right-of-way, allowing communication and power exchange between electrical substations along the track in Aurora, Warrenville, and Lombard. A fifth station was built southeast of Wayne for the Elgin branch. The substations converted the alternating current in the power lines to a lower-voltage direct current for use in the third rail. After its completion, the power station also provided power for at least three small trolley lines and several Fox Valley communities. The Cleveland Construction Company was hired to build the line. All three rails were traditional \\"T\\" design rails laid on stone ballast. Wooden railroad ties were laid 2,816 ties to the mile and separated at standard gauge. Every fifth tie was long to support the third rail. The majority of the line was a double track, with a single track running from the Chicago Golf Club to Aurora. Roadbeds for the double track were wide and were surrounded by woven wire fencing. The third rail was usually placed on the inner sides of the double track, providing safety for residents and employees. The third rail was interrupted at railroad crossings, where a cable was placed underground to carry the current across the gap. The first inspection trip of the line was held on May 16, 1902. the train departed from 52nd Avenue to Aurora, then traversed the AE&FRE; south to Yorkville then north to Dundee. AE&C; management announced later that evening that they planned on opening the line on July 1. The AE&FRE; announced soon afterward that it would offer express transfer service from Fox Valley communities to the AE&C.; On May 17, the AE&C; tested the powerhouse in Batavia and found several problems with its performance. Heavy rains in June stalled construction and washed out some completed roadbed. The opening date was pushed to July 12, but delays in rolling stock production further stalled it to August. Poor investments forced the Everett-Moore syndicate to sell its shares in the AE&C; in mid-1902. The company had formed a telephone company, but struggled to compete with the Bell Telephone Company. In addition, one of their construction companies went bankrupt, spurring a credit crisis in Cleveland. Creditors demanded pay, and the Everett-Moore group sold off several assets, including their shares of the railroad company totaling $200,000. The Pomeroy-Mandelbaum group still held a large share in the company and became leaders in its operation. The G. C. Kuhlman Car Company was tasked with providing thirty passenger cars but, for unknown reasons, the deal fell through. An order was placed with the Niles Car and Manufacturing Company in March 1902 for ten cars. Niles Cars were in such high demand that the company was unable to fulfill the full order, but did deliver the AE&C;'s first six cars on July 29, 1902. The cars were with four motors and wheels. They were described as \\"miniature Pullmans\\" and could seat forty-six or fifty-two passengers. Another twenty cars were ordered from the John Stephenson Car Company and would arrive after the railway was opened. Car 10 during an inspection on August 4, 1902. The first ten cars were assigned even numbers from 10 to 28. One final problem for the AE&C; was finding enough qualified motormen to run the trains. The company found none in the immediate area and had to recruit sixteen men from Dayton, Ohio. Another inspection tour occurred on August 4, from Wheaton to 52nd Avenue. A Niles Car was pulled by a steam locomotive along the track to ensure that none of the curves were too sharp for the intended rolling stock. Original plans called for the third rail to guide the car, but the company experienced many electrical problems along its power lines. By the time the third rail was functioning properly, two hundred and fifty utility poles had burned to the ground due to faulty insulators. A final inspection took place on August 21 from Wheaton to Elmhurst. Although problems with the utility poles were noted, the inspection was otherwise considered a success. For the next three days, engineers tested the line from Aurora to Wheaton so that they would have a familiarity with the track. =Early service= Despite a malfunctioning power system, a group of nearly- untrained motormen, and only six pieces of operational rolling stock, the Aurora branch of the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad opened on August 25, 1902. Fares were 25 cents one-way and 45 cents round-trip. Passengers who wanted to enter The Loop had to transfer to the Metropolitan West Side Elevated at 52nd Avenue for an additional five cents. Service began at 5:33am and concluded at 11:33pm, with trains running every thirty minutes. Terminals were opened to the public at 52nd Avenue, Austin Avenue (in Chicago), Oak Park, Harlem Avenue (in Forest Park), Maywood, Bellwood, Wolf Road (in Hillside), South Elmhurst, Secker Road (in Villa Park), Lombard, Glen Ellyn, College Avenue (in Wheaton), Wheaton, Gary Road (in Wheaton), Chicago Golf Grounds, Warrenville, Ferry Road (in Warrenville), Eola Junction (in Aurora), and Aurora. A one-way trip from Aurora to Chicago was seventy-five minutes. The final four cars from the Niles Car Company arrived on September 5 and were put into service seven days later. The original train schedules posted at stations showed service on the Batavia branch. However, actual service did not begin until the last week of September 1902. The Batavia branch met the Aurora branch at Eola Junction. Even when opened, the Batavia branch experienced little traffic and may have been primarily used as convenient transport for railroad officials to the Batavia powerhouse. Car 12, pictured southwest of Wheaton on October 22, 1902. Note that the trains ran on a single track on this portion of the line. The AE&C; issued promotional leaflets to citizens of Fox Valley cities and towns. They also sent these pamphlets to settlements west of Aurora, hoping that people would take a steam train to Aurora and then transfer to the electric line. They boasted that the AE&C; was the \\"finest electric railroad in the world.\\" By the end of the year, the AE&C; was seeing monthly earnings in excess of $16,500. In addition, the nearby Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad had a dramatic decrease of passengers between Aurora and Chicago. The twenty cars from Stephenson arrived in December 1902. Fifteen cars were equipped with motors (even numbers 30‚Äì58) and five did not (odd numbers 101‚Äì109); these latter five cars were intended to only be used as trailing cars. Trailing cars would often be added or removed at Wheaton depending on the number of passengers. The Stephenson cars were almost identical in every respect to the Niles cars. These new cars reduced the travel time between Aurora and Chicago to one hour. The new cars also allowed the railroad to operate at faster speeds‚Äîone run from 52nd Avenue to Aurora averaged . Service to Elgin began on May 29, 1903.http://www.greatthirdrail.org/chronology.htmlhttp://vmrr.org/history/ The branch split off from the main line at Wheaton, and allowed trains from Chicago to reach the Fox Valley city in sixty-five minutes. When opened, the AE&C; was able to change its schedules to allow trains to leave 52nd Avenue every fifteen minutes, alternating between Aurora and Elgin. All trains at this point ran locally, stopping at every station. The AE&C; briefly considered expanding to Mendota in late 1903, but determined that it was not worth the financial risk. Though cars primarily carried passengers, some early morning cars carried light freight. Notably, the AE&C; reached a deal with the Chicago Record Herald in October 1903 to distribute the paper to the suburbs along the line. On December 1 1909 http://www.greatthirdrail.org/chronology.html the railroad added a branch from near Wheaton to Geneva. This was extended to St Charles August 25 1910 Most of the interurban's lines used a third rail for power collection, which was relatively unusual for interurban railroads. While third rail had become the standard for urban elevated railroad and subway systems, most interurban railroads used trolley poles to pick up power from overhead wire; the AE&C; only used trolley wire where necessary, such as in the few locations where the interurban had street running. Originally, the railroad's Chicago terminus was the 52nd Avenue station that it shared with the Garfield Park elevated railroad line of the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad, and where passengers transferred between interurban and elevated trains. Beginning on March 11, 1905, the interurban began operating over the Metropolitan's \\"L\\" tracks, allowing AE&C; trains to directly serve downtown Chicago. At the same time, the Metropolitan's Garfield Park service was extended west of 52nd Avenue, replacing the AE&C; as the provider of local service over the interurban's surface-level trackage as far west as Desplaines Avenue in Forest Park. The interurban's trains terminated at the stub-ended Wells Street Terminal, adjacent to the Loop elevated. The interurban continued to use the \\"L\\" tracks through the years of Chicago Rapid Transit Company (CRT) ownership and into the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) era. The Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad World War I was tough for the AE&C;, and the railroad entered bankruptcy in 1919. Having shed the Fox River Lines (an interurban which paralleled the Fox River), the reorganized company emerged from bankruptcy as the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad on July 1, 1922, under the management of Dr. Thomas Conway, Jr.. A branch from Bellwood to Westchester opened October 1 1926.http://www.greatthirdrail.org/chronology.html CRT's elevated train service was extended onto the branch; the \\"L\\" company was the sole provider of passenger service on the branch and this new service replaced the CA&E's own local service on its main line east of Bellwood. CA&E; public timetable dated February 2, 1936. The railroad ran enough service to fill most of a 12-page folder with train schedules. Utilities magnate Samuel Insull gained control of the CA&E; in 1926. Insull and his corporate interests had already taken over and improved the properties of the North Shore and South Shore Lines. Insull's plans to make similar improvements to the CA&E; were scrapped as the result of the Great Depression. With the collapse of his utilities empire, Insull was forced to sell his interest in the CA&E;, and the railroad was once again bankrupt by 1932. The line connecting West Chicago with Geneva and St. Charles was abandoned October 31 1937.http://www.greatthirdrail.org/chronology.html =Postwar years of decline = The railroad was unable to exit from bankruptcy until 1946. Even though the railroad suffered from low revenue, high debt, and shortage of capital, wartime revenues and hopes for a stronger customer base in the growing west suburban region led the railroad to undertake an improvement of its service. The railroad made substantial improvements to its physical plant and acquired ten new all-steel passenger cars in 1946 and made plans for eight more, with the intention of retiring the oldest wooden cars that had been on the railroad's roster from its earliest years. However, the postwar years saw increasing shifts of passengers away from rail traffic and into automobiles, and then the CA&E; found the rug pulled from beneath the railroad. The plans for construction of the Congress Street Expressway (now known as the Eisenhower Expressway) in the early 1950s not only loomed as a source of further drain on CA&E; traffic, but the right- of-way of the new highway necessitated the demolition of the CTA's Garfield Park elevated line, which the CA&E; depended upon to reach its downtown terminus. The expressway's construction plans provided a dedicated right-of- way for trains in the highway's median strip. However, during the estimated five years to complete the superhighway, both \\"L\\" and interurban trains would need to use a temporary street-level right-of-way. When the plans circulated in 1951, CA&E; objected to the arrangement, citing the effects on running time and scheduling of its trains as they negotiated the streets of Chicago's busy West Side at rush hour. The railroad estimated that the delays would cost the railroad nearly a million dollars a year, to say nothing of the long-term effects of the new superhighway on the railroad's revenue. Another long-term concern was the railroad's downtown terminal; the new median strip line would have no access to Wells Street Terminal. As a compromise, the railroad gained approval to cut back its service to the Desplaines Avenue station in Forest Park -- the westernmost terminus of CTA Garfield Park service, after the CTA ended its unprofitable elevated train service on the CA&E;'s Westchester line in 1951. At the new Forest Park terminal, riders would transfer from the CA&E; interurban to a CTA train to complete their commute into the city. This terminal consisted of two loop tracks (one for CA&E; and one for CTA) where passengers could make a cross-platform transfer between the interurban and trains of the CTA operating over the temporary street-level trackage -- and presumably the eventual new median strip Congress line. Unfortunately, with the change being put into effect on September 20, 1953, CA&E; riders lost their one-seat ride to downtown Chicago. Within a few months of the cutback, half of the line's passengers abandoned it in favor of the parallel commuter service provided by the Chicago and North Western Railroad -- today operated by Metra as the Union Pacific/West Line. =Rolling stockFinal years= The loss of one-seat commuter service to the Loop devastated the interurban. The railroad's financial condition was already shaky, and schemes to restore downtown service faced various legal or operational obstacles. As early as 1952, the railroad had sought to substitute buses for trains,\\"Suburbs Fight to Keep C. A. & E. as Rail Line,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, Feb. 13, 1952, p. B9 and after years of financial losses, in April 1957 the Illinois Commerce Commission authorized the railroad to discontinue passenger service.\\"Aurora & Elgin Gets State's O.K. to Drop Passenger Trains,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, Apr. 4, 1957, p. 5 Passenger groups and affected municipalities sought injunctions that forced the railroad to temporarily continue service, but as soon as court rulings cleared the way, management abruptly ended passenger service, at noon on July 3, 1957. Commuters who had ridden the CA&E; into the city found themselves stranded when they returned to take the train home. Freight operations continued for two more years until June 10, 1959. No trains ran after this point, but the right-of-way and rolling stock were preserved in the event that a party stepped forward to purchase the property. The official abandonment of CA&E; came at 5:00pm on July 6, 1961, four years after the final passenger trains had run. The real estate became part of the Aurora Corporation of Illinois, a small conglomerate, which slowly sold off the right-of-way and other properties. Portions of the right-of-way are now operated as a multi-use trail called the Illinois Prairie Path.

It stars Andy Lau as the Knight of Gamblers, Stephen Chow as the Saint of Gamblers, and Ng Man-tat as Blackie Tat. This film is a sequel to both God of Gamblers, which included Lau's character, and to All for the Winner, which starred Chow and Ng. This film should not be confused with God of Gamblers Returns, also released as God of Gamblers 2, and in essence the true sequel to the original God of Gamblers. In this film, down on his luck Sing (Chow) seeks out the God of Gamblers in hopes of becoming his disciple. Unfortunately, the God of Gamblers is unreachable and out of the country, last heard to be in Brazil, and Michael Chan, the Knight of Gamblers (Lau) replaces the God of Gamblers. When a phony attempts to impersonate the Knight of Gamblers in a huge scam, it's up to the real Knight and Saint of Gamblers to team up and defeat their formidable challenger. The film combines intricate action sequences with sharp comedic timing. Plot After being mentored by the God of Gamblers Ko Chun, Michael Chan/Little Knife (Andy Lau) has become a top gambler and become renowned in the United States, where he is branded as the Knight of Gamblers. Having achieved successful and fortune, Michael currently inhabits in a villa previously owned by his Kuwait neighbor, Sam, who has gone broke after Kuwaiti was invaded by Iraq. Ko's friend, Mr. Yama plans to announce Michael's identity and his charity casino project to the Hong Kong press, but Ko's rival, Chan Kam-sing, who is imprisoned after being defeated by Ko, wants to seek revenge, so Chan's godson, Hussien, schemes to destroy Michael's reputation by impersonating him. On the other hand, Sing (Stephen Chow), despite a world champion gambler and branded as the Saint of Gamblers, is living in poverty since he cannot spend any money won by using his supernatural powers as it gives him bad luck, so his uncle, Blackie Tat (Ng Man-tat) suggests him to plead the God of Gamblers to accept him as a disciple. After sending a video to Michael which he dismisses, Sing and Tat march into Michael's mansion where they are kicked out by the latter. They sneak in again at night but is caught and beaten by Michael's bodyguard, Lung Ng (Charles Heung), but they refuse to leave and stays outside all night. The next day, Hussein sends killers to Michael's mansion. While Michael defeats several killers and successfully escapes with Sing and Tat, Ng was knocked out in an explosion and was abducted by Black Panther. Michael brings Sing and Tat to his village old home, which is inhabited by his underling, Raven, and Sam. Using his supernatural powers, Sing sees an unconscious Ng being brought to a bar, so he visits the bar with Tat where they meet the owner, Dream (Sharla Cheung), who looks exactly like Sing's old crush, Yee-mung. Tat becomes smitten with Dream, much to Sing's dismay, and pleads Sing to transfer some of his supernatural powers to him. Tat uses the powers to win stud poker game at Dream's house and gives some of his winnings to Dream, causing himself and Sing (whose power energy is connected to) to lose their supernatural powers. It is then revealed that Hussien found out from a mainland Chinese supernatural power expert, Tai-kwan, how to get rid of Sing's powers and forced Dream, who owes him HK$2 million to manipulate Tat. Hussein then attempts to rape Dream and kidnaps Tat. Meanwhile, Michael finds out from the newspaper that Hussien schemes where the latter plans to announce to the press about a fraud casino ship project to scam patrons, Michael plans to expose Hussien and prove himself to be the true Knight of Gamblers. With the help of Sing, Michael manages to win enough funds from Brother Kau's gambling den and confronts Hussien on his ship the next day to face off with him. However, Hussein's ship is surveillanced with high technology to help him cheat and since Sing lost his supernatural power, Michael loses. When Michael attempts to calls his mentor in Brazil to expose Hussein to the press, he discovers Tat and Ng have been captured and backs off. While feeling hopeless, Sam scolds Michael and Sing before returning to Kuwaiti to fight for his country, which motivates to confront Hussein at his ship again the next day. Knife publicly asks Hussein for HK$20, which he is able to use and win HK$25 million while Sing (having freed Tat and Lung) helps him distract Tai-kwan, allowing him to enter into the King of Cards competition. Although Hussein. As other players are eliminated, Michael, Sing, Hussein and Tai-kwan at the table. While Hussein and Tai-kwan try to cheat, Michael and Sing work together and eventually defeat Hussein and causes Tai-kwan to lose his supernatural power. Hussein's henchmen attempt to kill them, but Michael, Sing takes them down with the help of Ng and his younger sister, Kowloon (Monica Chan) and Michael exposes Hussein to the public before flykicking his face with Sing. In the end, Michael proposes a plan to Sing where the two agree to give each other their winnings, since Ko demands Michael to donate most of his winnings to charity and Sing would lose his powers if he spends his winnings, but Ko arrives to interrupt them.

Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I is a role-playing video game published by Interplay Productions. It is an adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring by J. R. R. Tolkien, being the first volume in The Lord of the Rings. The game was released in 1990 for DOS, in 1991 for the Amiga and PC-98, and in 1992 for the FM Towns. It was followed by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers. It was originally designed for the Commodore 64, but the production team switched to the newer platforms. The game was designed by Troy A. Miles, Scott Bennie, Jennell Jaquays, and Bruce Schlickbernd. Overview The game is a role-playing game (RPG) in which the player, after an opening cinematic, takes control of Frodo Baggins just outside Bag End. From here, the player gradually \\"recruits\\" various members of the Fellowship, and while the game can be completed by following the novel for the most part, many side-quests also exist to entertain the player. The game world was quite large and featured a cast of characters from both the text and outside of it; character interaction is carried out through \\"questioning\\" other characters by typing keywords in a box. The player can swap whoever leads the \\"fellowship\\", equip other party members with a range of weapons and armour, distribute skills among the group, cast spells, and perform various skill-based actions. While following a somewhat linear plot, gameplay is quite open and players can revisit old areas and, potentially, discover new situations and characters, creating a fairly dynamic game world. The game also includes a day/night cycle, in which enemies such as the Nazg√ªl make more frequent appearance outside of daylight hours, and other enemies receive strength bonuses in the dark. Departures from the book include new characters and shifts in items to create player \\"quests\\"‚Äîsuch as finding the pieces of And√∫ril scattered across the lands west of Rivendell to reforge Aragorn's sword, whereas in the book Aragorn had all fragments. The most significant change is in the climax, where Frodo and Sam are carried off by a Nazg√ªl to the tower of Dol Guldur, and the rest of the Fellowship must solicit the help of the Elves of Lothl√≥rien and Radagast the Brown, a wizard, in order to infiltrate the tower and save Frodo before the Witch-king carries him away to Mordor. Strangely enough, events in Lothl√≥rien are actually quite true to the book, including the mirror of Galadriel and a quest to find all the gifts she gives the Fellowship. The game was originally packaged with maps of the major dungeons of the game, but due to most used game retailers not requiring such materials as part of a trade-in, most people purchasing the game secondhand had no access to such information. Reception Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai in 1991 liked the game's characters, puzzles, graphics, and soundtrack, but criticized it for not going beyond the source material and, by being the first of a trilogy, forcing players to wait after seeing one third of the story. The magazine concluded that \\"what it is not, is special enough to carry the Tolkien name\\", regretting that the author was not alive to collaborate in game design. Scorpia in 1991 cited some flaws but called the game \\"probably the best so far of the Tolkien adaptations\\" and in 1993 stated that it was \\"a big game [that] will not be completed quickly, no matter how well you may know your Tolkien\\". The game was reviewed in 1991 in Dragon #169 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.

A former Spanish unarmored gunboat, Mariveles was laid down in 1886 by Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company, Hong Kong; purchased by the War Department in 1898; transferred to the Navy on 2 May 1899; and commissioned 17 June 1899, Lt. (jg.) J. W. Oman in command. Service history Departing Cavite shortly after commissioning, Mariveles steamed for the southern Philippines to patrol off the coasts of Leyte, Cebu, and Samar. Cooperating with the Army in suppressing the Filipino insurgents in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, the gunboat served in this area for six months, and then saw duty as a convoy escort and artillery support vessel during the Kobbes Expedition against forces on Luzon in January 1900. In February, following patrol duty off the eastern coast of Luzon, the ship returned to Manila for overhaul at Cavite Navy Yard. She decommissioned there in early March. Mariveles recommissioned briefly from 16 to 22 August to act as a ferryboat for the Army in Manila Bay, and then was placed in ordinary at Cavite. The gunboat returned to active service on 1 May 1901, and sailed on 22 May, via Cebu, for Iloilo, Panay. She patrolled off the coast of that island and Samar cooperating with Army units ashore, protecting American lives, and suppressing piracy. The gunboat was decommissioned on 8 August 1901 at Cavite and was held in reserve at the Navy Yard, serving intermittently as a ferry in Manila Bay, until stricken from the Navy list on 8 June 1908. She was sold to Faustino Lichauce on 2 January 1909.

He played the power forward and center positions for five teams during 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association. He was known for his tenacious rebounding and blue-collar defense. During his career, he played with the Sacramento Kings (where he made First Team All-Rookie in the 1994‚Äì95 season), Portland Trail Blazers, Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns. Early life Grant grew up in the small, rural community of Georgetown, Ohio, near the Ohio River about 40 miles southeast of Cincinnati. During summers, he spent most of his time working at area farms, cutting, housing, and stripping tobacco, digging potatoes and baling hay. He played basketball at Georgetown High School, mostly in anonymity until Xavier University's basketball office began receiving anonymous calls stating that they should take a look at Grant. Xavier assistant coach Dino Gaudio finally scouted Grant, followed by visits from XU head coach Pete Gillen. Georgetown High's gymnasium has since been renamed Brian Grant Gymnasium. College career Grant played basketball at Xavier University, but the anonymity quickly faded. After four seasons at Xavier, Grant was second on the all-time leading scorers' list with 1,719 points. He was twice named Midwest Collegiate Conference Player of the Year. All four seasons at Xavier he led the Musketeers in rebounding, and was third on the all-time leading rebounding list with 1,080. He was named to the Associated Press honorable mention All- American team in his junior year, after ranking second in the nation in field goal percentage with 65.4 percent. He was inducted into the Xavier Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999 and became one of only four basketball players to have his jersey retired, in a ceremony held in 2011.  NBA career Sacramento Kings= Grant was selected in the first round, eighth overall, in the 1994 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings. In his rookie season he started in 59 out of 80 games, averaging 13.2 points a game with 7.5 rebounds. The following year, he started in 75 out of 78 games, increasing his scoring average to 14.4 points a game as the Kings made the playoffs. The Kings lost in four games to the top-seeded Seattle SuperSonics in the first round, with Grant averaging 9.8 points per game for the series. He signed a five-year, $29 million contract, but due to injuries appeared in only 24 games in the 1996‚Äì1997 season, and the Kings did not make the playoffs. =Portland Trail Blazers= Grant opted out of the deal following the 1997 season to sign a six-year, $56 million deal with the Portland Trail Blazers. In his first year with the Trail Blazers he started in 49 of 61 games as the team made the playoffs but lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Lakers 3 games to 1. Grant averaged 13.2 points and 10.7 rebounds a game for the series. The 1998‚Äì1999 season was shortened to 50 games because of a league lockout, and Grant started 46 of 48 games with a scoring average of 11.5 points a game and a team high 9.8 rebounds per game. The Trail Blazers won the Pacific Division, swept the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs and defeated the previous Western Conference Champion Utah Jazz in six games in the second round. In the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers were swept by the league-leading San Antonio Spurs. Grant started all 13 playoff games and averaged 13.2 points with 9.2 rebounds. Prior to the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Portland acquired veteran all-star Scottie Pippen, and coach Mike Dunleavy decided to use Grant as a reserve behind rising all-star Rasheed Wallace, who would go on to have a career year during the season as the Trail Blazers won 59 games and the second seed in the Western Conference. Portland opened the playoffs with a 3-1 first- round win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, with Grant and Wallace both being used as defensive options against Kevin Garnett. Grant was used in a similar fashion against Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz in the second round, with Portland advancing in five games. In the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers faced the Los Angeles Lakers led by Pippen's former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson and the duo of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. The teams split the first two games before the Lakers took games 3 and 4 to take a 3‚Äì1 series lead, but Portland responded with a win on the road in game 5 and a home win in the sixth game to set up a seventh game with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. Despite taking a double-digit lead into the fourth quarter, the Lakers rallied and won the game, eliminating Portland. Grant averaged 5.4 points and 5.8 rebounds throughout the 2000 playoff run. After two years as the starting PF and one year as the Blazers' number one big man off the bench, Grant once again opted out of his deal to become a free agent, hoping to land a starting job elsewhere. =Miami Heat= In the summer of 2000 Grant signed a 7-year $86 million deal with the Miami Heat, despite coming off season averages of 7.5 ppg and 5.5 rpg. The deal raised eyebrows, but Heat President and GM Pat Riley insisted that Grant was the missing piece to the Heat's championship puzzle, along with other recently acquired players Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason. Weeks before the start of the season Miami's all-star center Alonzo Mourning was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease forcing Riley to play Grant at center despite usually playing at the power forward position. Grant responded by putting up a career season of 15.2 ppg, 8.8 rpg, and a career high 79.7% at the foul line. Miami won 50 games, and Mourning returned to the team in late March, but were swept in the first round by the younger Charlotte Hornets. Grant averaged 10 points and 8 rebounds for the series. In the 2001‚Äì2002 season, with the anticipated return of Mourning to the lineup, Grant returned to his natural power forward position. Grant started in 72 games for Miami averaging 9.3 points and 8 rebounds a game for the season, but the Heat failed to reach the postseason. The next year signaled a rebuilding era for the team, as the Heat won just 25 games with Grant averaging 10.3 points a game along with a career high 10.2 rebounds, which placed him at fifth in the league in rebounds per game. He also finished the season 4th in total rebounds, 5th in defensive rebounds, and 10th in the league in field goal percentage at .509 percent, all personal bests. The Heat once again found themselves in the lottery, and would select Dwyane Wade in the draft to join sophomore Caron Butler before acquiring free agent Lamar Odom in the offseason. Alonzo Mourning, who did not play in the 2003 season, left the team and signed with the New Jersey Nets, leaving Grant as the team's best option at the center position. Just prior to the 2003‚Äì2004 season, another major franchise change occurred, as Pat Riley stepped down as coach. He would be replaced by longtime assistant Stan Van Gundy. The 2003‚Äì2004 season proved to be a major success for the rebuilding franchise, as the Heat overcame an 0-7 start to eventually make the playoffs as the 4th seed in the East led by the play of Odom, Jones and Wade. Grant started 76 games at center and averaged 8.7 points and 6.9 rebounds a game. In the playoffs, the Heat defeated the New Orleans Hornets, who had relocated from Charlotte, in a challenging 7 game series in which the home team won every game. In the second round the Heat faced the top seeded Indiana Pacers, who took the first two games in Indiana before the Heat won two straight games at home to tie the series at two games apiece, including a game three victory led by Grant's 16 rebounds. The Pacers would win the next two games to advance however, defeating the young Heat team considered to have much promise heading into the future. Grant averaged 7.1 points and 8.6 rebounds a game throughout the postseason. =Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns= During the summer of 2004, the Heat traded Grant (along with Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, and a future first-round draft pick) to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for superstar Shaquille O'Neal. Grant would play one year for the rebuilding Lakers, playing in a total of 69 games and starting in 8 with career low averages of 3.8 points and 3.7 rebounds a game. That off-season Grant was released and signed with the Phoenix Suns. He would go on to only appear in 21 games for the Suns, including 5 games in their playoff run which resulted in wins against the Lakers, and the Los Angeles Clippers before falling to the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Finals. Following the season Grant was traded in the 2006 NBA draft to the Boston Celtics with the rights to Rajon Rondo in exchange for a future first-round draft pick. After being waived by the Celtics on October 27, 2006, Grant formally announced his retirement after lingering injuries had reduced his level of play for several seasons. He is nicknamed \\"The General\\" after growing up in the same town of Georgetown, Ohio, as Civil War Union general and President Ulysses S. Grant. Brian worked with Greg Oden in the 2009 off-season in Columbus, Ohio, for the purposes of adding more toughness, basketball smarts, and miscellaneous advice. Personal life Grant is the father of seven: sons Amani, Elijah, Jaydon, Jonavan, and Brian; and daughters Maliah and Anaya. =Charity work= Brian Grant is well known for his contributions to the communities in various cities. Grant served as the Oregon and Southwest Washington spokesperson for Ronald McDonald House Charities when he was with the Portland Trail Blazers. Grant and Ronald McDonald House Charities teamed up in July 1999 to hold \\"Brian's Bash\\" ‚Äì a celebrity golf tournament in Portland ‚Äì to raise money for seriously and terminally ill children. During his time as an NBA player, he started his own foundation in order to assist seriously ill children, as well as their families, and under- privileged youth. These numerous acts of selflessness and generosity were recognized by the NBA in 1999 when he was awarded the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award. A few of the programs that The Brian Grant Foundation has launched are the \\"Scholastic Attendance Program\\", the \\"Christmas Adopt-A- Family Program\\", the \\"Thanksgiving Dinner Distribution Program\\" with Pazzo's Restaurant, Mother's Against Gang Violence, the TLC Soup Kitchen, and the \\"Brian Grant Free Summer Basketball Clinics\\" in Portland, Oregon, and Georgetown, Ohio. After retiring from the NBA and moving his family back to his adopted hometown of Portland, Oregon, Grant was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in November 2008. With new friends in Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali, who share the disease with Brian, he decided to recreate the Brian Grant Foundation; this time, with a new focus and mission. The new charity supports efforts toward the education and awareness of Parkinson's disease in order to increase earlier diagnosis, educate patients and their families, and provide a viable forum for people affected by the disease. The mission of the foundation is to help those impacted by Parkinson's to live active and fulfilling lives. The foundation hosts an annual fundraiser, Shake It Till We Make It, to raise money to provide support and resources for all those affected by Parkinson's disease. Shake It Till We Make It is a two-day celebrity gala and golf tournament hosted in Portland, Oregon. The Brian Grant Foundation partners up with other foundations, such as the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center, to support and fund research dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease and to finding improved therapies for people living with Parkinson's disease. =Health= In November 2005, after talking with a neurologist at OHSU, Brian Grant was diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson's disease. Through discussions and encouragement by well-known Parkinson's sufferers Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali, Grant publicized his diagnosis in 2009.

The supervillains are alternate-reality counterparts of Green Lanterns Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner, and John Stewart, respectively. Originally residing on Earth-Three, which was subsequently destroyed during the 12-issue Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series, Power Ring, along with the other Syndicate members, end up being re-created in the Anti-Matter Universe's Earth. The first Power Ring debuted in Justice League of America #29 (August 1964). Fictional character biographyCrime Syndicate of America (1964‚Äì1985)= Little is known of Power Ring's history. From what little he has said on the matter, he was given his magical power ring and power battery by a monk named Volthoom. With these weapons, he equals the power of a Green Lantern. When Power Ring, Johnny Quick and Superwoman first arrive on Earth-One, they attempt to destroy first the Justice League and later the Justice Society of America of Earth-Two. Though beaten on the native Earths, they are able to transport both teams to Earth-Three, where they defeat them. The JLA and CSA battle on Earth-Two after the JSA are imprisoned. The Syndicate is defeated and imprisoned in an inter-dimensional limbo by Green Lantern Hal Jordan. They remain there for years until an experimental dimensional transponder used by the Secret Society of Super- Villains disrupts the stability of the Crime Syndicate's prison. Power Ring, Johnny Quick, and Superwoman use the opportunity to escape. The Syndicate assumes the Secret Society villains were heroes and battled them. In a second confrontation, the Society takes Superwoman's magic lasso, the ring of Power Ring, and Johnny Quick's helmet. These objects of power would be used by the Wizard to cast a spell. The Crime Syndicate fight Captain Comet, believing he is part of the Secret Society. Focusing his will through his power battery, Power Ring is able to use it as a weapon, just as he had used his ring. Unknown to the villains, Power Ring's battery of power has been leaking energy, a result of its long confinement and disuse in limbo. Victims left in its wake are stricken with nausea, severe pain and eventual loss of consciousness. Their inert forms then glow an unearthly green before mutating into horrible rampaging creatures. Captain Comet discovers the source of the transformation, and after capturing the Syndicate, uses the power battery to cure the victims and return the Crime Syndicate to their interdimensional prison. Comet destroys the battery afterwards. Years later, the Syndicate get another taste of freedom. Travelling through time, Per Degaton stumbles upon the interdimensional prison. He offers the Crime Syndicate an escape if they would help him in 1962 to take Cuba's intercontinental ballistic missiles. After they accomplish this task, Degaton has little use for them. When the Syndicate betrays him, they are sent to 1982, as he had made sure this would happen when they touched him. The Syndicators rematerialize on the JLA satellite by the League's teleporter. They quickly overcome the surprised heroes who are waiting for the JSA's annual meeting with the two groups. The JSA had been sent to the Crime Syndicate's interdimensional prison and are able to escape with the combined powers of Starman and Doctor Fate. Power Ring returns with the Syndicate to assist Per Degaton's plan to rule the world. Though they had been double-crossed by Degaton, they help him until the moment comes to strike. The villains once again fight the JLA, the JSA, and even members of the All-Star Squadron from 1942. When the villains are again defeated, the failure of Degaton's plan wipes the events from existence. Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985‚Äì1986) The members of the Crime Syndicate are believed to be killed during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Power Ring and the Crime Syndicate are destroyed by waves of anti-matter, unleashed by the Anti-Monitor in his attempt to control all of existence. Crisis 2 Years afterwards, a strange disruption in reality (featured in Animal Man by Grant Morrison) brings back Syndicators Ultraman, Power Ring, Johnny Quick, and Owlman, as well as other variations of the Justice League. Power Ring and Ultraman think they have come back from the dead, but later learn forces beyond their imaginations are responsible for their brief return. Power Ring wishes to return to the way his life used to be, and with that thought, he vanishes. The others go into the Medusa Mask of the Psycho-Pirate, and they have not been seen since. Convergence During the Convergence storyline, Power Ring is with the Crime Syndicate when they plan to free Superwoman from death row.Convergence: Crime Syndicate #1 =New Earth (1987‚Äì2011)=Crime Syndicate of Amerika Eventually, the Crime Syndicate were re-imagined as being from the antimatter universe and Power Ring resembles a blonde Kyle Rayner. This Power Ring, weak-willed and cowardly, is tricked into accepting the ring from its previous owner. After invading the other universe, Power Ring is defeated by Aquaman, as the nature of the Earths gives native beings an advantage. Syndicate Rules On the antimatter Earth, Power Ring is Joseph Harrolds (corresponding to Hal Jordan). On this Earth, the power ring is powered by an entity called Volthoom. A second Power Ring (corresponding to Kyle Rayner), a blond man whose name was not given, was given the ring by Harrolds and joined the Syndicate; however, when the antimatter universe was reconstructed after Krona had initially wiped out that plane of existence when trying to discover the origin of the Universe, certain elements of the antimatter universe's history had been changed, and now the second Power Ring was a black man whose name was also not given (corresponding to John Stewart). He confirmed that Harrolds tricked him into assuming responsibility of the ring, which was cursed as Volthoom was also inside the ring. Crime Society of America In 52 Week 52, an alternate version of Earth-Three was shown as a part of the new Multiverse. In the depiction were characters that are altered versions of the original Justice League of America, including Green Lantern. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the two panels in which they appear, but the altered Green Lantern is visually similar to Power Ring. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the Pre-Crisis Earth-Three, making this a new character unrelated to previous versions. In Countdown #31, he is confirmed as being called Power Ring, a member of the Crime Society, alongside Ultraman, Superwoman, and Owlman. Justice League Omega The antimatter Crime Syndicate reappeared in writer James Robinson's Justice League of America series as part of the Justice League Omega storyline. Directly mirroring Hal Jordan's resurrection in Green Lantern: Rebirth, Power Ring has once again changed his appearance and now resembles Jordan. Ultraman mentions that Power Ring's transformation into a Hal Jordan analogue (as well as the Kyle Rayner analogue's transformation into John Stewart in the Syndicate Rules storyline) had happened suddenly and with no explanation, but notes that Power Ring is now once again in his \\"original\\" form (mirroring the mainstream DC continuity, where Hal was the first modern Green Lantern). The Crime Syndicate attacks the Hall of Justice in order to steal Alexander Luthor's corpse from the Justice League's mausoleum, and Power Ring enters into a confrontation with Jade. Though Power Ring initially gains the upper hand, Jade ultimately defeats him after she absorbs the energy in his ring, rendering him powerless.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #50 When the Crime Syndicate members agree to work with the JLA to stop a new villain named the Omega Man, Power Ring begs Jade to return his powers to him, but is ultimately killed when the Omega Man ambushes the group and impales him through the back.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #52 =The New 52 (2011‚Äì2016)= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, four different characters have used the name. First Lantern During the \\"Rise of the Third Army\\" storyline, the First Lantern is introduced as a mysterious entity trapped millennia ago by the Guardians of the Universe in the place known as the Chamber of Shadows. In the present, the Guardians seek to destroy all the universal emotions and reopen the Chamber to combine his powers with their own flesh, thus creating the Third Army.Green Lantern Annual (vol. 5) #1 (October 2012) However, the combined efforts of all the other corps against the Guardians end up weakening the First Lantern's prison, thus setting him free.Green Lantern Corps Annual (vol. 3) #1 (March 2013) In \\"Wrath of The First Lantern\\", the First Lantern's origins are revealed as of being a mysterious explorer named Volthoom from a parallel world called Earth-15, brought to Oa by Krona's first attempt to uncover the origins of the universe. Taken before the Guardians of the Universe, Volthoom was shown to be able to harness the power of the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum to warp reality. As they scrambled to learn everything they could about the Emotional Spectrum, they also try to copy his gifts using technology until they were finally able to create the original lantern and ring. However, over time Volthoom grew proud and when the Guardians considered sharing the power of the lights with the rest of the universe, Volthoom disagreed. He left the Guardians and began wreaking havoc across the universe, killing millions. The Manhunters were then created to stop the rampage, but he could not be destroyed. Instead, the Guardians imprisoned the First Lantern as well as their own emotions and wrote him out of their history. A number of Oans (who kept their emotions) remained behind to ensure that the First Lantern was kept imprisoned and became known as the Hidden Ones.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #18 (May 2013) Freed, Volthoom began siphoning energy from multiple bearers of power rings in the hopes of gaining enough power to rewrite the entire universe. However, using the Black Ring, Hal Jordan summoned Nekron and drained the villain from the Emotional Spectrum, rendering the Lantern powerless against the Dark Guardian, who kills him.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #20 (July 2013) Though Volthoom was killed by Nekron, part of his soul remained in the ring that the Earth-Three villain Power Ring wielded. It was revealed that this ring was created when Volthoom was traveling from Earth-15 to various other Earths within the Multiverse to seek a way to save his home, and he arrived on Earth-3 and encountered the wizard Mordru, who fused a piece of Volthoom's soul to create the power ring. Volthoom described that they had a dispute and left, while the ring would continue to remain in Earth-3 until the \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline.Green Lanterns #18 Abin Sur (Earth-3) Abin Sur was the most recent unwilling bearer of the Ring of Volthoom. He is weak-willed and cowardly as opposed to his heroic counterpart Abin Sur of Earth-One, who was strong-willed and brave. He begs Harold to take the ring by promising it will make him powerful and is shown to be joyous once Harold does, claiming himself to be finally free. However, he dies shortly after this from the injuries sustained from his crash, finally being freed only to meet his bitter end. Abin Sur has shown to have suffered adverse physical effects from the ring far worse than any other user ever displayed. His entire body has been destroyed due to his bearing the ring for a long period of time.http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/13/geoff-johns-talks-justice- league-31s-new-power-ring Crime Syndicate Power Ring is one of the members of the Crime Syndicate to arrive from Earth-3 at the conclusion of the \\"Trinity War\\" event.Justice League (vol. 2) #23 Power Ring is the villainous counterpart to Hal Jordan's Green Lantern and in an inverse relationship to Green Lantern, the character and syndicate member \\"Power Ring\\" is actually the Ring of Volthoom while Harold Jordan (Hal Jordan's Earth-3 counterpart) is merely his current vessel, though both are referred to as Power Ring throughout the comic. Harold worked as a janitor at Ferris Air, where he spied on Carol Ferris' operations to sell them out. When being confronted by Carl Ferris, Abin Sur's ring of Volthoom chooses Harold, bringing him to Abin's crashed ship. Abin begs Harold to take the ring, which he does, freeing Abin Sur. Harold quickly realizes his mistake, as the ring opens a pocket dimensional portal to charge itself, unleashing a creature that attacks Harold. Power Ring then goes on to form the Crime Syndicate along with Ultraman, Superwoman, Owlman, and Johnny Quick. http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2014/05/22/forever-evil-five-unanswered-questions He is first seen at the end of \\"Trinity War\\" emerging with the rest of the Crime Syndicate from the portal from Earth-Three. He immediately attacks the Justice League upon arrival, knocking them all down with an energy blast while Harold nervously questions whether the area is safe.Trinity War end During the \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline, Power Ring accompanies Deathstorm in his raid on Belle Reve and destroys the roof to free its inmates.Forever Evil #1 Later, again accompanying Deathstorm, Power Ring attacks the Rogues, who have refused to cause mass deaths in their own city, against the Crime Syndicate's orders.Forever Evil #3 When Deathstorm leaves to head back to the Syndicate's lab, Power Ring, with Secret Society members, attack Batman, Catwoman, and Lex Luthor's Injustice Society at Wayne Enterprises. Batman attempts to stop Power Ring with a Sinestro Corps ring, but Power Ring's constructs are able to remove the ring and destroy it. However, Batman's use of the ring summons Sinestro.Forever Evil #4 Power Ring battles Sinestro, but Sinestro cuts off his arm with the ring; after the ring deems Harold irreparably damaged, it flies off. Harold thanks Sinestro for freeing him from his curse. Sinestro welcomes his thanks and incinerates him. The ownerless ring then flies off to find a new host.Forever Evil #5 While Harold is seemingly shown to wield the Ring of Volthoom quite proficiently, the Ring of Volthoom is actually the one in control, though Harold does have some independent control over the ring's power. The ring of Volthoom is as powerful as a Green Lantern ring http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/04/the-crime-syndicate-is-coming-to-dc- collectibles#7 and is even able to fight on par with a Sinestro Corps ring, remove it from the user's hand and impressively destroy the Sinestro Corps ring itself. The Outsider refers to Power Ring as his master and mentions to Pandora that Power Ring has killed many immortal beings during the Crime Syndicate's time on Earth-Three Trinity of Sin: Pandora #5 Jessica Cruz Jessica Cruz and her friends are on a hunting trip when they accidentally stumble across two men burying a body. The men brutally murder her friends. Jessica manages to escape but is left traumatized. The Ring of Volthoom, which feeds off fear and had abandoned Harold after his death during the Crime Syndicate's incursion to Prime Earth, is able to locate her due to her trauma. Unlike the previous ring bearers, she does not willingly accept the Ring but is forced to do so. The ring tortures Jessica with physical and psychological pain. Batman is able to de-power the Ring after convincing Jessica to face her fears. Hal Jordan returns to Earth to teach Jessica how to control the ring, but in a later adventure, the ring finds a chance to possess Jessica's mind and body. Jessica becomes trapped within the ring along with Cyborg while Power Ring is in full possession of her body. With Cyborg's, help Jessica is able to momentarily take control and saves the Flash from the Black Racer by allowing the incarnation of death to apparently kill her. Jessica survives, and it is revealed that the Black Racer killed Volthoom instead, causing the ring to crumble into dust. Immediately afterwards, a Green Lantern ring descends at the battlefield and transforms Jessica into a new Green Lantern. Solomon Baz Solomon Baz was the Earth-3 doppelg√§nger of Simon Baz. He was once a getaway driver with a fearsome reputation until he took a job delivering a bomb to a concert. Arriving at the venue, Solomon relented, unable to bring himself to blow up the young concertgoers. Questioning his identity and overcome with insecurity, Solomon was soon selected to become the new host and victim of the Ring of Volthoom. When his life was inevitably consumed by the ring, Solomon joined the other deceased ring bearers of the Power Ring Corps in the Green Realm. There he remained, buried in the dirt, until called upon to face his Earth-0 counterpart. Green Lanterns #46 Powers and abilities All Power Rings wield a magical ring (except in The New 52, where the ring appears to be alien technology mixed with magic) that can generate a variety of effects and energy constructs which give them powers equivalent to those of a Green Lantern. In its first appearance, it not unlike a lantern ring sustained purely by the ring wearer's strength of will. The power ring has been referred to on several occasions as the \\"most dangerous weapon in the universe\\" and the limits of its power are not clearly defined. With sufficient willpower, a Power Ring could conceivably wield nearly omnipotent power. However, all stories after 1964 no longer have the ring draw its strength from willpower. After Crisis 2, the various incarnations of Power Ring refer to wielding the ring as a \\"curse\\"; Volthoom, the entity within the ring, would frequently try to overtake the user's mind and the power ring is physically and mentally painful to wield. The New 52 series has the Ring of Volthoom rely on fear to function; however, unlike the Sinestro Corps ring, which relies on the fear of others, the Ring of Volthoom is sustained by the user's fear. Power rings allow the user to fly and to cover themselves and others with a protective force field, suitable for traveling through outer space. They can also generate beams and solid structures of energy that can be moved simply by thinking about doing so, enabling the user to create cages, transportation platforms, walls, and battering rams. The ring can also be used to search for energy signatures or particular objects. It can serve as a universal translator. The ring can place people in a hypnotic trance, show other Earths and enable people to travel between them, even drawing them if the user is on another Earth; in 'Darkseid War', Grail, the daughter of Darkseid, states that the ring is a tether to Earth-Three and assaults its host to open a portal to Earth-Three, which allows the Anti-Monitor to cross over onto Earth-Zero. The ring can manipulate sub-atomic particles (effectively producing new elements) and split atoms, but those powers are rarely used by Power Ring. It is not known if any of the various Power Ring's ring incarnations have had a specific weakness, but in the original 1960's JLA/JSA/CSA encounter, both wooden and yellow weapons were ineffective against Power Ring. His amused response to these tactics indicated that he had not as yet encountered any ring-specific weaknesses or he would likely have been more cautious. Harold Jordan was shown using the Ring of Volthoom to connect directly to the JLA watchtower computer to talk to Grid. Further in The New 52, Harold Jordan was able to destroy a Sinestro Corps ring, crushing it in his hand. He also was able to destroy the constructs with his own and remove the ring from Batman, though the Sinestro Corps ring was very low on power, which may have contributed to Power Ring being able to destroy it (the Ring of Volthoom was also low on charge, albeit not as low as the Sinestro Corps ring). This mistake by Batman would later be made by Power Ring, as he had engaged Sinestro while his own ring was low on charge.In Forever Evil #4, Batman attempts to wield a Sinestro Corps Ring against Power Ring but is disarmed; Batman, however, used the ring to attract Sinestro, whom Power Ring then engages in battle. The ring appears to have a part of soul of a fully sentient entity named Volthoom, able to talk to and advise the user as to various courses of action (though it is stated that Volthoom can be unreliable); most portrayals show Volthoom to have a personality and a mind of its own unlike the highly advanced programs which reside in the Green Lantern rings. In the 1964 comic book, Volthoom is purportedly the mad monk that offered the ring to the first Power Ring, at which point he kills Volthoom and takes the ring. Justice League of America #50 seems to imply that Volthoom is the antimatter equivalent of the Starheart, which bestowed its power on Alan Scott and Jade on New Earth. Volthoom's character has evolved along with Power Ring. Pre-Crisis, Volthoom simply was the entity of the ring and would act no different than a standard Green Lantern ring (albeit magical in nature as opposed to scientific), only responding to the bearer's will. Later, Volthoom was retconned as the cursed spirit of the ring which attempted to overtake the mind of Harold Jordan and later other bearers of the ring. Volthoom would seek out cowardly, weak-willed individuals to manipulate and control because they would rely on the power of the ring and slowly allow Volthoom to possess them. In The New 52, Volthoom is far less subtle and directly feeds off the fear of the ring bearer and forces them to do his bidding. Volthoom causes the host tremendous pain to the point where Harold Jordan was actually relieved when Sinestro sliced off his arm and the ring left. The ring is able to fully possess a host if need be. The New 52 states that the entity within the ring contains a small portion of the soul of the First Lantern from \\"Wrath of the First Lantern\\". In addition, the effectiveness of a wielder's power ring can be adversely affected by a weakening of resolve and will or later fear. Prior to Post-Infinite Crisis, most if not all Power Rings did not have automatic shields provided by their rings and were forced to create constructs to defend themselves (this was a major difference between Power Ring and Green Lantern). In later stories like The New 52, the ring would typically reserves a small portion of their power for a passive force field that \\"protects the wielder from mortal harm\\". In dire emergency, that energy reserve can be tapped at the expense of said protection until it, too, is exhausted. Power Ring, in his original appearance, had a magical lamp which would act as a power battery for his ring. In The New 52, Power Ring's battery is located in a pocket dimension and has tentacles and a mouth with sharp teeth, Geoff Jones describes charging the ring as an horrific experience to the wielder. The ring has a green pocket dimension located within it which houses its central battery and other members of the Power Ring Corps In Justice League #49, Cyborg tells Jessica that the Power Ring's central battery is located within the ring; Jessica and Cyborg then notice the Power Ring Corps closing in on them. In the Forever Evil storyline in The New 52, Power Ring was shown with the ring of Volthoom; it was causing detrimental effects on his body. These effects were displayed through grotesque, greenish veins being visible on Power Ring's right hand and arm, extending to his neck. The same deformation was visible (to a much greater degree, resultant of a longer \\"bonding\\" period) on Power Ring's predecessor, Abin Sur. The deformation started to take effect on Jessica Cruz after the ring was placed on her hand. These veins are the ring mainlining with the wielder's basolateral nucleus in their amygdala in order to channel their fear. The ring is rendered powerless if its user is not afraid, Batman shut down the ring after he convinced Jessica not to be fearful; also, if the user is knocked unconscious, the ring will stop working until the user retains consciousness (as shown when Jessica Cruz was knocked out). Captain Cold was also able to \\"quiet\\" the ring for a few moments with a blast from his cold gun. The Flash also states that the Ring of Volthoom is unable to do anything that the user will not allow it to; to this end, Jessica Cruz was able to make Volthoom go into dormancy by enforcing her will over his. This was implied earlier In Forever Evil when Harold Jordan refused to charge his ring; it could do nothing but make more demands to get charged. This action ironically led to Harold's death as he foolishly battled Sinestro when the ring was low on power. The Outsider also mentions to Pandora that Harold Jordan, along with the rest of the Crime Syndicate, know how to kill immortal beings such as herself and have done so many times. Being magical in nature, Power Ring's ring is more effective than a normal Green Lantern ring against Kryptonians like Superman. As shown in Power Ring's first appearance, he was able to defeat Superman by transporting him to Earth-Three while pointing out that Superman is vulnerable to his ring's magic.Justice League of America #29 (August 1964) In other media * A version of Power Ring corresponding with Hal Jordan appears in Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths voiced by Nolan North (albeit uncredited).

The etymology of the name ‚ÄúVilcabamba‚Äù apparently derives from the Quichua ‚Äúhuilco pamba.‚Äù Huilco denotes the sacred trees, Anadenanthera colubrina, that inhabit the region; pamba (cognate with pampa) is a word meaning ‚Äúa plain‚Äù. The area has been referred to as the \\"Playground of the Inca\\" which refers to its historic use as a retreat for Incan royalty. The valley is overlooked by a mountain called Mandango, the Sleeping Inca, whose presence is said to protect the area from earthquakes and other natural disasters. Longevity of residentsReputation= Located in a historical and scenic valley, it is a common destination for tourists, in part because it is widely believed that its inhabitants grow to a very old age. Locals assert that it is not uncommon to see a person reach 100 years of age and it is claimed that many have gotten to 120, even up to 135, which would make it an area with the oldest inhabitants in the world. It is often called the Valley of Longevity. In 1973, Dr. Alexander Leaf of Harvard Medical School introduced these people to the world for the first time in his cover story for National Geographic Magazine.Alexander Leaf, (Jan. 1973). \\"Search for the Oldest People\\". National Geographic, pp. 93-118. =Skepticism of claims= According to The Bewildering History of the History of Longevity by Peter Laslett, \\"geographical variation in the incidence of long life is no doubt a reality but better general survival does not demonstrably raise the probability of extreme ages and systematic, sceptical analysis of these confidently asserted propositions has condemned them as entirely baseless.\\" Longevity in Vilcabamba has been attributed to nothing more special than the benefits of exercise, a healthy diet and good treatment of the elderly by the community. Longevity of the residents has also been attributed to a result of migration of younger people to cities. =Age exaggeration= Even as Vilcabamba's international fame grew, scientists continued to investigate the secret of the villagers' longevity, but some were beginning to grow skeptical. In particular, Dr. Alexander Leaf, the Harvard Medical School researcher who had been among the first to conduct research in Vilcabamba, was having doubts. His suspicions were aroused when he realized that the villagers were inconsistent in their self-reported ages. For instance, in 1971 he had met a man who reported his age as 122. When Leaf returned three years later, that same man claimed to be 134 years old. Leaf then persuaded Dr. Richard Mazess of the University of Wisconsin Madison and Dr. Sylvia Forman of the University of California Berkeley to help determine the correct ages of Vilcabamba's elderly population. They reached the conclusion that there was not a single centenarian living in Vilcabamba. The oldest person in the village was found to be 96 years old. The average age of those claiming to be over 100 years was actually 86 years. The researchers presented these results on February 27, 1978, at a workshop at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Far from being the 'Valley of Longevity,' the researchers concluded that \\"Individual longevity in Vilcabamba is little, if any, different from that found throughout the rest of the world.\\" Further, they reported that \\"Life expectancy (corrected for exaggeration) at all ages in Vilcabamba (and Loja) is, in fact, less than in the U.S.\\" =Sources of error= Mazess and Forman identified two sources of error. First, the villagers systematically exaggerated their ages and the older they grew, the greater their exaggerations became. Mazess and Forman provided the example of Miguel Carpio Mendieta (MCM): Apparently MCM did not begin exaggerating his age until later in life. When he was 61 in 1944 he reported an age of \\"70\\". Five years later he was reputedly \\"80\\". In 1970, at age 87, he was reputedly \\"121\\", and in 1974, at 91, he was \\"127\\". The researchers speculated that the villagers had originally exaggerated their ages in order to gain prestige in the community. This practice appeared to have been occurring for generations, long before academic researchers had arrived in the village. Additionally Dr. Leaf speculated that the international publicity, and subsequent rise in tourism, may have encouraged the villagers' exaggerations to grow more prolific. The second source of error was the widespread use of identical names in the small community. This had initially confused researchers who had studied the baptismal and birth records. The birth-date of an identically named uncle or father would appear to confirm the extreme longevity of a resident. By asking the Vilcabambans for the names of their godparents, the researchers were able to identify the correct records for each resident. It turned out that Vilcabamba did actually have a higher-than-normal percentage of elderly people, but that this was caused by migration patterns: Young people tended to move out of the area, while the elderly moved in. =Assessment= Although the Vilcabambans did not enjoy greater longevity than the rest of the world, researchers noted that the Vilcabamban lifestyle, which included hard work in a high altitude combined with a low-calorie, low-animal-fat diet, did seem to keep the villagers healthy and vigorous in their old age.

History Fiat Barchetta rear view (with third Brake-Light on the boot-lid) Fiat Barchetta rear view (without third Brake-Light on boot-lid) The Barchetta was developed between 1990 and 1994, under the project name Tipo B Spider 176. It was designed by Andreas Zapatinas and Alessandro Cavazza, under the supervision of Peter Barrett Davis and other car designers at the Centro Stile Fiat, and prototyping was carried out by Stola. Production began in February 1995 and lasted until June 2005, with a brief pause, due to the bankruptcy of coachbuilder Maggiora. The Barchetta was based on the chassis of the Mark 1 Fiat Punto. The Barchetta has 1,747 cc DOHC petrol engine fitted with variable camshaft timing, used for the first time in a Fiat production car, after being patented in 1970. The engine has and of torque. The Barchetta weighs 1056 kg (2328 lb) without air conditioning and can accelerate to in just over 7 seconds and has a top speed of 217 km/h (124 mph). It came in various trim levels which offered different features, for example, diamond cross stitch, patterned red leather instead of the standard black leather or fabric seats, alloy wheels instead of steel wheels, or fog-lights as an option. Arguably one of the biggest external cosmetic changes was made by the addition of the third brake light, first introduced by Fiat on the Lido and Riviera in 2000, and on sub models thereafter. The Barchetta was revised in August 2003 ahead of its relaunch the following year, with some alterations inside and out. The most notable changes were the revised front spoiler and rear bumper. Production of the car eventually stopped in June 2005. Interiors of a 1995 Fiat barchetta (95-96 cars are recognisable for the engraved Fiat logo on the steering wheel) Production Car bodies were welded at ILCAS in Sparone Canavese, and final assembly was done in Chivasso by the coachbuilder Maggiora. After Maggiora's bankruptcy in May 2002, Fiat relocated production of the Barchetta to its Mirafiori plant and resumed production two years later. Around 57,700 cars were built up to 2005. Production of the Barchetta was limited to LHD cars only, even though the car was marketed and sold in two RHD markets, the United Kingdom and Japan. Bertone concept car Fiat Barchetta by Bertone, 2007 The Italian styling house of Bertone created a one off roadster show car for Fiat called the Barchetta in March 2007, at the Geneva Motor Show. Notable examples A Barchetta featured in the Top Gear: Middle East Special television episode, which aired in December 2010. In the episode, the three presenters (Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May) attempted to follow the path of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem. Hammond drove the Fiat Barchetta (specifically a Riviera Special Edition featuring a black paint job and red quilted leather), compared to Clarkson's Mazda MX-5 and May's BMW Z3. At the end of the episode, the Barchetta was declared the most desirable, and most reliable of the three cars.

As orator Maulana Syed Ibne Hasan Nunahrvi was renowned for his oratory and Urdu language speeches. He was a pious and sincere scholar with tremendous control over religious matters and reciting majlis. Maulana Nunahrvi learned the art of oratory from his teacher Allama Syed Sibte Hasan Naqvi, who was the pioneer of the format of majalis which are recited to the present day. Before their time, majalis in Lucknow and other places contained marsiya, recited by great poets like Meer Babbar Ali Anees and Mirza Dabeer. The new format had khutba in Arabic, some tafseer with fazail of Ahlul Bayt lastly masaeb of Karbala. Maulana Nunahrvi was known for his beautiful language and delivery of difficult tafseer and Islamic philosophy.

His father, Fran√ßois Broussonet (1722-1792), was a physician and professor of medicine at famous Universit√© de Montpellier. His brother, Victor, studied there and later became its dean. Henri Fouquet (1727-1806), a professor at the medical school, was a relative, as was Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756-1832), who subsequently became minister of the interior. As a child, Pierre showed a passion for natural history, cluttering his father's house with specimen collections. In school, he excelled in classical studies in Montpellier, Mont√©limar, and Toulouse. Because of family tradition, he was headed toward studying medicine, which, at that time, included the study of the natural sciences which had not yet split off to form a separate discipline. Antoine Gouan (1733-1821), a convinced Linnaean, taught at the Montpellier medical school - apparently it was from him that Broussonet learned of Linnaeus‚Äô work. His thesis was entitled M√©moire pour servir √† l'histoire de la respiration des poissons, which he defended in 1778. He received his doctorate on 27 May 1779, at the age of eighteen. Broussonet‚Äôs thesis was unanimously praised. Despite his youth, the professors of the University of Montpellier asked that he be made his father‚Äôs successor when the latter retired (a rare but not uncommon request). The request was not granted, in spite of Broussonet himself traveling to Paris to plead his cause. But while in Paris he established friendships scholars who made it possible for him to continue his studies on fish. Although the Paris ichthyological collections surpassed those that Broussonet had worked from in the South, they were not comprehensive enough for the classification work he wished to pursue. Ultimately, he went to England to seek the specimens needed for the morphological and systematic work he had in mind. 1780 London offered Broussonet all he could wish for: an active scientific community; naturalists already embracing Linnaeus‚Äô ideas; collections rich in new species; and an influential friend, Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820). With his promotion, Broussonet was elected to the Royal Society. Banks had brought back from Cook's first expedition a considerable number of exotic fish, which he turned over to Broussonet for study, thereby making it possible for Broussonet to start his Ichthyologiae Decas I, which was to contain descriptions of 1,200 species. The first ten sections, in which he noted the important discovery of the Pseudobranchia, were published in 1782 (Broussonet's Ichthyologia was never completed). When Broussonet returned to his homeland in 1782, he brought a Chinese maidenhair tree (Ginkgo biloba), given by Sir Joseph Banks and the first specimen of this tree imported into France. This species is often called a living fossil because it was first observed by Europeans in fossil records before they discovered living trees in the Zhejiang province in eastern China. He presented this rare tree to Gouan, then Directeur du Jardin des plantes de Montpellier, who planted it in the garden in 1788, where it can still be found. Broussonet also spent several months botanizing in the South of France and Catalonia with John Sibthorp (1758-1796) with Father Pierre Andr√© Pourret (1754-1818). When he returned to Paris in 1785, Broussonet presented some of his Notes ichthyologiques before the Acad√©mie des Sciences. Their merit and the support of Louis Jean-Marie D‚ÄôAubenton (1716-1799), who, although anti- Linnaean, was friendly toward Broussonet, resulted in his election to the Academy. The challenges met by pre-revolutionary France led to Broussonet's decision to abandon the science of ichthyology. Many thought that the improvement of agricultural production, both in quality and in quantity, was an important priority. This view was especially held by Berthier de Sauvigny (1737-1789), the administrator of Paris, and responsible for its food supply. He had met Broussonet while in England studying methods of cultivation and animal husbandry. Berthier, who had revived the Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôAgriculture, persuaded Broussonet to become its secretary. In addition to this post, Daubenton, who in 1783 had accepted the chair of rural economy at the Alfort Veterinary School, passed on this additional responsibility to his young friend. Broussonet tried hard to fulfill the duties of his new offices. From 1785-1788, he published short notices, some signed, some anonymous (many are still unidentified to this day), for the use of farmers. Unfortunately, this work came too late, and the beginning of the French Revolution put an end to Broussonet's agricultural efforts. Broussonet, then twenty-eight in 1789, enthusiastically welcomed revolutionary ideas, as was characteristic of his generation, but he was horrified by the tactics of the extreme left. On 22 July 1789, his friend Berthier, held responsible for the current famine, was lynched and dragged through the streets before his eyes. Seeing the danger, Broussonet fled Paris. In 1792 he took refuge in Montpellier but was accused of federalism and thrown in jail. He remained there only a few days, but his liberty was still precarious after his release. He then left Montpellier for Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre to join his brother Victor, then a doctor in the army of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales. On 19 July 1794 he crossed the Spanish border. Broussonet was warmly received by the botanists Casimiro G√≥mez Ortega (1741-1818) and Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles (1745-1804) in Madrid, Gordon in Jerez, and Jos√© Francisco Correia da Serra (1750‚Äì1823) in Lisbon. Banks also continued to be in contact and helped him financially. But French citizens who had emigrated to Spain earlier looked upon him as a revolutionary. Having become friends with Simpson, American consul in Gibraltar, Broussonet accompanied him as physician on a diplomatic mission to Morocco, where he studied the flora. In 1795, when he returned to France, Broussonet's name was removed from the list of political refugees, and he regained possession of his property. Elected to the Institut in 1796, he requested appointment as a voyageur de l‚ÄôInstitut, stating that he wished to return to Morocco to continue his research. In 1797 he was named vice-consul at Mogador. There he carried on his work of collecting and describing plants and animals, as well as attending to his consular duties. In 1798, Ortega attempted to honor Brousonet with genus Broussonetia in the family Fabaceae, but it was rejected (now Sophora). In 1799, Charles Louis L'H√©ritier de Brutelle (1746‚Äì1800) successfully honored Brousonet with the genus Broussonetia (family Moraceae, tribe Moreae). A plague threatened Mogador in 1799. On 8 July, Broussonet sailed with his family to the Canary Islands, where he became commissioner of commercial relations. He continued his collecting and observations, writing of them to Cavanilles, L'H√©ritier, and Humboldt. When the local authorities forbade him to travel, Broussonet decided to leave his post. He asked to be sent to the Cape of Good Hope, where he hoped to create a botanical garden. Chaptal, then minister of the interior, supported his young relative's request, and Broussonet was named commissioner of commercial relations to the Cape on 15 October 1802. He returned to France in 1803 to prepare for this new assignment, only to learn that Chaptal had changed his mind and had had him made professor at the medical school of Montpellier, to succeed Gouan. Besides its teaching duties, Broussonet's new title, Directeur du Jardin des Plantes de Montpellier, put him in charge of the botanical gardens. He restored its former layout and, helped financially by Chaptal, built an orangery, dug ponds, and enlarged the collections, of which he published a list in 1805 - Elenchus plantarum horti botanici Monspeliensis. Broussonet was preparing to describe the 1,500 species collected at Tenerife when he suffered a stroke that caused a gradually worsening aphasia. On 17 August 1806 he notified the director of the medical school that he must resign his post, and a year later, he suffered a final stroke that caused his death.

Unlike most other software programs of its kind, AveDesk is heavily community driven. A dedicated section of the forums on Aqua-Soft, an online community of skinning enthusiasts dedicated to emulating the look and feel of Mac OS X Leopard, is used by users of the software to report bugs or request for new software features directly to the programmer, cutting any red tape in the way. New features are also better discussed among the users of the software program and the programmer himself. The \\"Ave\\" in \\"AveDesk\\" is a shortened version of the author's name, Andreas Verhoeven. Features AveDesk desklets are skinnable plugins developed in Visual C++ that can display themselves as widgets, rather than just simply script files. One advantage is that the desklets can have its entire appearance more easily changed to suit the tastes of its users, rather than having to create an entirely new desklet, as in most other widget engines. However, due to the same reason, users cannot easily create custom-made desklets for AveDesk as other similar programs (such as Konfabulator and DesktopX). To work around this, AveDesk users usually use a plugin called SysStats, which allow users to easily create and run desklets for AveDesk using scripts (such as JavaScript and VBScript), coupled with specially structured INI files and computer image files that make up the look and functionality of the widget. With the release of version 1.3 of AveDesk, a new scripting engine, called AveScripter, will be developed to take advantage of the updated internal architecture of desklets. The engine is more closely integrated with AveDesk, and is able to take advantage of the internal features that come with the new version, such as visual effects included with AveDesk and a special library of graphical user interface controls intended for AveDesk desklets, called AveControls. =Desklets= AveDesk is mainly used by Windows users emulating the look and feel of Mac OS X. This can be seen in the default set of desklets included in the program. Some of the more commonly used ones include: *A \\"PidlShortcut\\" desklet (the most popular among the default set of desklets in AveDesk), a skinnable shortcut desklet that can point to a computer file or folder, but with customisable looks and functions and the ability to use a high-resolution PNG image as an icon for the shortcut (instead of the usual low-resolution Windows icon), as well as to provide additional information, such as the number of files in the folder or the size of the disk drive, *A skinnable \\"iTunesDesklet\\" desklet (also known as \\"AveTunes\\"), which is an iTunes remote control, similar in functionality to its Mac OS X's Dashboard counterpart, but can have its appearance changed through skins, and *A \\"StickyNotes\\" desklet, which can hold simple notes and is very similar to the Stickies widget in Mac OS X's Dashboard. This desklet is an updated replacement for the \\"Notes\\" desklet found in earlier versions of AveDesk. *A \\"Translator\\" desklet, which uses an online language translator to translate text from one language to another, and is similar to its Mac OS X's Dashboard's counterpart, but can have its appearance changed through skins. Among the languages supported are the more commonly spoken languages in Europe (such as English, French and German), as well as Chinese, Korean and Japanese. Version 1.3 of AveDesk adds several new internal features as mentioned earlier, and a few new desklets were made to take advantage of them. In addition to the \\"Translator\\" and \\"StickyNotes\\" desklets (which were added in version 1.3) described above, two other desklets worth mentioning are: *A \\"ChalkBoard\\" desklet. Essentially a simple electronic drawing pad, a user can use a mouse to write or draw on the pad. The user can choose between five drawing colours and three pen sizes. *A \\"WordSearcher\\" desklet, which allows a user to search either an online dictionary or thesaurus. The desklet's colour changes to green if an entry is found, and red if it is unable to find the entry. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all the desklets included with AveDesk. =Features= Among the features of AveDesk not usually found in other widget engines are: *An installer feature. New users are easily confused with the correct installation of new desklets. To work around this, desklet creators can create specially pre-packaged desklets (which are actually ZIP files with the correct directory structure and instructions for the software program). Users need only to open the package with AveDesk, which will then automatically and correctly install the desklets for the user. *Modules, which extend the functionality of the software program itself. These modules act as plugins to the AveDesk program itself, and are not desklets or widgets. Modules provide additional functionality such as the ability to show or hide \\"PidlShortcut\\" desklets that point to specific disk drives as they are mounted or dismounted, or to automatically hide all normal desktop icons when the program is started. *A themes feature. This feature allows a user of AveDesk to save the configurations and positions of AveDesk desklets he or she has running on the desktop, so if the user wishes to go back to that configuration in the future, he or she only needs to load that theme into AveDesk, saving the hassle of rearranging and reconfiguring the desklets. This feature came about after some users of earlier versions voiced the need to use multiple configurations of AveDesk desklets. *Showcase. Similar to Konfabulator's Konspos√©, and patterned after Mac OS X's Dashboard and Expos√©, this feature quickly brings AveDesk desklets to the foreground, with the background dimmed. The user can set the hotkeys used to activate ShowCase, as well as setting the \\"dimness\\" of the background. *The ability to add custom visual effects to desklets, and to create new ones using specially crafted scripts. Unlike other widget engines, where visual effects are limited to the scope of the widgets, users can add their own visual effects onto AveDesk desklets, separate from the desklet. Many of the effects mimic the animations present on Mac OS X, but a few effects were unique to AveDesk, which some cross-platform users using the software application feel are better than their counterparts on Mac OS X. *A control panel. Instead of a context menu listing all open widgets (as in most other widget engines), AveDesk uses a control panel for centralised desklet management. The control panel list all currently open desklets (along with a \\"live\\" thumbnail image of the desklet), as well as a menu bar. From there, a user can open and close desklets, configure AveDesk's options, set the defaults for new AveDesk desklets, switch or create new AveDesk themes, or install and manage modules. Like other widget engines, however, AveDesk does place an icon in the taskbar, but it does not contain a list of running desklets. Its main purpose is to activate the control panel, to switch themes, and to shut down the program itself. *ObjectDock docklet support. Highly unusual for widget engines, AveDesk not only support its own plugin formats, but plugin formats of other applications that uses plugins (in this case, ObjectDock). One could run an ObjectDock docklet inside AveDesk as if it were an AveDesk desklet. *Labels and sublabels. Each AveDesk desklet can have its own label, which the user can change. Some desklets makes heavy use of this feature, such as the \\"PidlShortcut\\" desklet; the labels provide the name of the file or folder it is pointing to, and the sublabels can provide additional information about the file or folder. Sublabels were added in version 1.1 to allow such shortcut desklets to more closely mimic their Mac OS X counterparts, which has this feature for all icons. This feature exists in the first place because ObjectDock docklets (which AveDesk can support, as described above) usually emanate information through labels, as well as the icon representing the docklet itself. History AveDesk was actually a spinoff of another different software project. Originally, Andreas Verhoeven (who was then a creator of ObjectDock docklets) was developing a program that could run ObjectDock docklets in Y'z Dock (a now-defunct program that was similar to ObjectDock) and vice versa, in order to resolve incompatibilities between the two programs. Instead, he managed to have ObjectDock docklets running on the desktop, independent of ObjectDock (hence the support for ObjectDock docklets). From there, he began further developing the idea that eventually led to AveDesk. During its development, he coined the term \\"desklets\\" to describe the widgets of AveDesk (as desklets are to computer desktops as docklets are to dock programs such as ObjectDock). In late 2003, Andreas released AveDesk 1.0 on the Aqua-Soft online community. Soon after, a number of desklets intended just for AveDesk appeared. Some of the more notable desklets that helped propel AveDesk's popularity was a simple but skinnable shortcut desklet (the predecessor to the \\"PidlShortcut\\" desklet), that can be easily customised to take on the look and feel of Mac OS X desktop shortcuts but complete with functioning Windows context menus, a disk drive desklet (similar to the shortcut desklet) that could be set to appear only when that particular disk drive has been mounted, and a Trash can desklet that has the additional functions of ejecting a CD or DVD disk drive when its icon has been dragged onto it. These desklets helped to increase the appeal of AveDesk to skinning enthusiasts who wanted to emulate the look and feel of Mac OS X. In late 2004, Andreas released version 1.1 of AveDesk to an eager audience of skinning enthusiasts, who had previously been teased with screenshots of the new version of AveDesk while it was in development. Users who installed the new version were greeted with improved desklets and new, custom visual effects (as described above). These visual effects further increased the appeal of AveDesk, and version 1.1 was embraced heartily by skinning enthusiasts, making it one of the more popular widget engines for Windows, along with already popular widget engines at that time (such as DesktopX). In early 2005, version 1.2 of AveDesk was released. Version 1.2 was one of the biggest (if not the biggest) update to AveDesk. Many new features were added to this version, with some of them requested by users of earlier versions; the themes and installer features, as well as Showcase were among the features new to the release. The various shortcut desklets were also replaced by a new, updated \\"PidlShortcut\\" desklet, bringing together and improving on the functions and quality of the shortcut desklets it displaced. Additional visual effects, such as improved shadows for the text on each desklet's label and fade-in/fade-out effects, were also added. On October 26, 2005, Avedesk version 1.3 was released. This version was originally intended to be a minor update to iron out some quirks in previous versions of AveDesk, but it eventually became one of the biggest update to be rolled out. Several new features were incorporated into the release, such as additional hardware- accelerated visual effects when closing or configuring each desklet, along with improved desklets, some of which were described above. Currently, the software program is at version 1.4 which added support for Windows Vista.

Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan and North America in 1990, it came to Europe the next year, and was ported to the Nintendo PlayChoice-10 arcade system. It sold approximately 1.2 million copies worldwide. The game was included in The Disney Afternoon Collection compilation for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One released in April 2017. Gameplay Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers is a platform game featuring single and 2-player cooperative modes, allowing players to choose which levels to access via a map of various locations throughout the city. Each individual stage is set up as a side-scrolling action game where Chip and Dale can walk, jump, duck, and pick up objects such as acorns, crates, barrels, and balls to throw at enemies and bosses. Each character can withstand only three direct hits before they lose a life, and there are no passwords. In two-player mode, Controller 1 is Chip, Controller 2 is Dale. The rest of the Rescue Rangers also appear to support Chip and Dale. Monterey Jack will occasionally appear to break down certain barricades, while Zipper grants temporary invincibility to the player when found. Gadget, though in Fat Cat's captivity, provides tips and advice for the chipmunks in each stage. Plot The Rescue Rangers are going on a mission to retrieve a missing kitten for a girl named Mandy. As Gadget goes on ahead to scout the area and Monterey Jack is sent to investigate sightings of strange mechanical dogs with Zipper, Chip and Dale proceed through the streets and into a laboratory, where they are attacked by a crazed robot. After defeating the robot, Fat Cat appears and reveals that \\"Mandy's kitten\\" was just a distraction so he could kidnap Gadget and force her to work for him. Fortunately, Gadget is able to contact Chip and Dale by building a wireless phone and sending a map to them via carrier pigeon, allowing them to navigate through the treacherous landscape and reach Fat Cat's casino where she is being held. After rescuing her, Gadget provides the chipmunks with a rocket that sends them towards Fat Cat's hideout so they can defeat him. Development Rescue Rangers was the second Capcom-developed Disney game after 1989's DuckTales, also for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was produced by Tokuro Fujiwara, who had previously worked on titles such as Mega Man 2 and Ghosts'n Goblins. According to then-Disney game producer Darlene Lacey, the title was one of the \\"least troublesome\\" Capcom projects to meet the company's family-friendly ethics standards, with very few changes made during development. The Japanese and European versions of the game contain fixes to minor graphical glitches during the opening cutscene seen in the North American release, and a leaked prototype cartridge from a private collector reveals that at one time the player was only required to collect half as many flowers and stars to gain extra lives, though the original amounts were still erroneously printed in the North American instruction manual. Reception Rescue Rangers proved to be a commercial success, selling approximately 1.2 million copies worldwide, becoming Capcom's fourth highest-selling game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It met with a mostly positive response upon its release in North America, with Electronic Gaming Monthly finding that \\"like previous Disney titles for the NES, this Capcom game offers the best graphics and game play for both young and old players alike,\\" praising the title's 2-player option and \\"cartoon\\" visuals. The magazine criticized the title's lack of difficulty, saying \\"like the other Disney games, Capcom has hurt a great cart by making it too easy,\\" calling the game \\"a great package that ends too quickly.\\" Conversely, European Mean Machines magazine called it \\"tough and enjoyable,\\" and said \\"what sets Rescue Rangers apart from other NES platformers is the speed of gameplay and the level of challenge.\\" The game received the Parents' Choice Foundation's 1990 Parents' Choice Award for video games that November. Nintendo Power ranked Rescue Rangers 79th in their 1997 list of the top 100 greatest games released for Nintendo systems, saying \\"Capcom lived up to its reputation for superior play control and graphics.\\" In 2009, website IGN placed the game 71st on their list of the 100 greatest NES games of all time, with editors remarking that the title may have been more linear than Capcom's earlier title DuckTales, but it was nonetheless \\"an addictive platforming masterpiece\\". That year, GamesRadar ranked the game sixth on their list of the seven best Disney games, saying Rescue Rangers was \\"still worth playing\\" nearly 20 years after its original release. Sequel Capcom released a sequel in December 1993 titled Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2, also for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The title has similar graphics and gameplay, as well as additional incentives for cooperative play such as mini-games that can only be played by two players and the ability to throw one's partner as a weapon.

This was the author's last play. It is rarely revived. Like the earlier plays of the trilogy it has been turned into operatic form, but it has not entered the general opera repertoire. Background The characters of Figaro and his associates were so popular that other dramatists had written sequels to The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro, most notably M-N Delon, who brought out Le Mariage de Cherubin in 1785 and Le Mariage de Fanchette the following year.\\"M-N Delon\\", WorldCat, accessed 14 May 2013 In the preface to the first published edition of The Marriage of Figaro, Beaumarchais had declared his intention of writing a sequel. The Tartuffe figure who insinuates himself into the household for his own enrichment is B√©gearss. Like Moli√®re's original, he gains such influence over the head of the household that even when the latter finally understands the deception, the intruder is so firmly in control of the family's affairs that is only with difficulty that he is defeated. B√©gearss is almost certainly based one of Beaumarchais's enemies, a lawyer called Nicolas Bergasse, with whom the author had been embroiled in an acrimonious legal case in the last days of the Ancien R√©gime. Beaumarchais completed the play early in 1791. It was to have been staged by the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise, but the author fell out with the management over authors' rights. Instead the piece was premiered at the new Th√©√¢tre du Marais on 26 June 1792, and ran for fifteen performances across six weeks. Soon after this, Beaumarchais found it prudent for political reasons to go into voluntary exile. In his absence his friends arranged for the text of the play to be published, in the hope of preventing unauthorised editions by opportunistic publishers. They made some changes to comply with the prevailing orthodoxy of the French Revolution: most particularly they suppressed the Almavivas' aristocratic titles \\"Count\\" and \\"Countess\\". By 1796 Beaumarchais had returned to Paris and the play was finally presented at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 1797 and again in 1799‚Äì1800. The work thereafter fell out of the general repertoire, but was revived successfully at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 1990. Characters Illustration of Countess Almaviva by √âmile Bayard (1876) Illustration of B√©gearss by √âmile Bayard (1876) The characters, as described by Beaumarchais's characterisations,Beaumarchais, introductory page are: *Count Almaviva, a Spanish lord with noble pride but not vanity. *Countess Almaviva, very melancholy, and with the piety of an angel. *Chevalier L√©on, their son (actually, the son of the Countess and Ch√©rubin, who died in battle); young man obsessed with freedom, like all ardent new souls. *Florestine, ward of Count Almaviva; a young person full of compassion. *B√©gearss, Irishman, a Major in the Spanish military, an old secretary to the Count when he was ambassador; a very deep man, and great schemer of intrigues, accomplished in the art of troublemaking. *Figaro, servant and confidant of the Count; a man formed by worldly experience and events. *Suzanne, maid and confidant of the Countess; wife of Figaro; excellent woman, devoted to her mistress and having left behind the illusions of youth. *M. Fal, the Count's notary; a precise and honest man. *Guillaume, German valet to M. B√©gearss; a man too gentle for such a master. PlotSynopsis= The action takes place twenty years after the previous play in the trilogy, The Marriage of Figaro. The story's premise is that several years ago, while the Count was away on a long business trip, the Countess and Ch√©rubin spent a night together. When the Countess told Ch√©rubin that what they did was wrong and that she could never see him again, he went away to war and intentionally let himself be mortally wounded on the field. As he lay dying, he wrote a final letter to the Countess, declaring his love and regrets, and making mention of all the things they had done. The Countess did not have the heart to throw away the letter, and instead had a special box supplied by an Irishman called B√©gearss, with a secret compartment in which to store the incriminating note, so the Count would never find it. Soon after, to her dismay, the Countess discovered herself pregnant with Ch√©rubin's child. The Count has been suspicious all these years that he is not the father of L√©on, the Countess's son, and so he has been rapidly trying to spend his fortune to ensure the boy won't inherit any of it, even having gone so far as to renounce his title and move the family to Paris; but he has nevertheless held some doubts, and therefore has never officially disowned the boy or even brought up his suspicions to the Countess. Meanwhile, the Count has an illegitimate child of his own, a daughter named Florestine. B√©gearss wants to marry her, and to ensure that she will be the Count's only heir, he begins to stir up trouble over the Countess's secret. Figaro and Suzanne, who are still married, must once again come to the rescue of the Count and Countess; and of their illegitimate children L√©on and Florestine, who are secretly in love with each other. =Detailed plot= ;Act I Figaro and his wife Suzanne are still in the service of Count Almaviva and his wife Rosine, but the household has all moved to France. The Count is there with the intention of dissipating his large fortune, not wishing to leave it to his heir, L√©on. The piece begins on Saint Leo's day, the birthday of the son the Countess has had with the former page, Ch√©rubin. Ever since the Count and Countess's only son died in a duel, the Count has been hostile to L√©on, who he suspects is the fruit of the Countess's adultery. Monsieur B√©gearss, an Irishman, is introduced to the household. Figaro and Suzanne suspect him of wanting to betray them. He wants to marry Florestine, the ward of the Count, and to move L√©on‚Äîwho also wants to marry Florestine‚Äîaway to Malta, accompanied by Figaro. B√©gearss calls the Count's attention to a letter that Ch√©rubin wrote to the Countess, which confirms the Count's suspicions about his wife's infidelity and L√©on's parentage.Beaumarchais, pp. 1‚Äì21 ;Act II Having read the letter the Count is infuriated, finding at last substantiation of his suspicions. He consents to let B√©gearss marry Florestine. B√©gearss tells the household that Florestine is the actual daughter of the Count, and that she therefore cannot marry Le√≥n. She dissolves into tears and Le√≥n is grief-stricken.Beaumarchais, pp. 22‚Äì46 ;Act III The Countess is persuaded that it will be in Florestine's best interests to marry Begearss; the Count is prepared to give a substantial part of his fortune to Begearss as part of the marriage settlement. At the insistence of B√©gearss, the Countess tearfully burns the letters she has kept from Ch√©rubin. The marriage ceremony is to take place that evening.Beaumarchais, pp. 47‚Äì61 ;Act IV The Countess promises L√©on she will appeal to the Count. She makes an eloquent plea, but the Count rebukes her over her adultery. The Countess faints, and the Count hastens to summon help. Suzanne and Figaro uncover B√©gearss's plot, and are determined that he must be prevented from marrying Florestine and getting hold of the Count's fortune.Beaumarchais, pp. 62‚Äì86 ;Act V Figaro and Suzanne convince the Count and Countess that B√©gearss is a bad man who is plotting against them. The disclosure of B√©gearss's treachery brings the Count and Countess together. Almaviva, overwhelmed by relief at seeing Florestine saved from marrying B√©gearss, is ready to forgo his fortune; Figaro, on the other hand, has no intention of letting the villain get away with the Count's money. The Countess adopts Florestine as her daughter and tells her not to marry B√©gearss; the Count adopts L√©on as his son. B√©gearss returns from a notary, now in a strong legal position over the Count's money. By complicated trickery led by Figaro, B√©gearss is finally outwitted and sent away empty-handed and furious. As it is now established that L√©on is the Countess's son but not the Count's, and Florestine is the Count's daughter but not the Countess's, there is demonstrably no consanguinity, and they are free to marry one another.Beaumarchais, pp. 87‚Äì100 Operas As with the other Figaro plays, there are operatic versions; as with the play itself, they are not nearly as well known as those made from the two earlier plays. The first proposal to turn The Guilty Mother into an opera was by Andr√© Gr√©try, but the project came to nothing.Howarth, Chapter 15 Darius Milhaud's La m√®re coupable (1966) was the first to be completed,\\"La m√®re coupable; op√©ra en 3 actes\\", WorldCat, accessed 14 May 2013 and Inger Wikstr√∂m made an adaptation called Den Brottsliga Modern (1990). In John Corigliano's The Ghosts of Versailles, there is a subplot in which the ghost of Beaumarchais, as an entertainment for the ghost of Marie Antoinette (with whom he is in love), conjures up a performance of the play as an opera: A Figaro for Antonia, claiming that by doing so he will change history and that Marie Antoinette will not be executed.\\"The Ghosts of Versailles\\", US Opera, accessed 14 May 2013 In April 2010, the opera L'amour coupable by Thierry P√©cou to a libretto by Eug√®ne Green based on the Beaumarchais play, received its world premiere at L'Op√©ra de Rouen.\\"Thierry P√©cou: L'amour coupable\\", Thierry P√©cou, accessed 15 June 2017 Notes and references ;Notes ;References Sources * * External links *\\"L'autre Tartuffe, ou La m√®re coupable by Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais\\", Gutenberg *\\"Figaro in Changing Times: Beaumarchais's La M√®re coupable\\" Category:Plays by Pierre Beaumarchais Category:1792 plays Category:Plays set in France Category:Sequel plays Category:Plays adapted into operas ","title":"The Guilty Mother"},{"id":"2476927","text":"Peter Roland Cope (7 December 1921 ‚Äì 4 April 2005) was the last surviving test pilot from the Avro Arrow program.

Biography Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Hornbein developed an interest in geology as a teenager. His study of geology led to a fascination with mountains. Eventually he also became interested in medicine; he received his MD in 1956 from Washington University School of Medicine and worked as an anesthesiologist. He also studied human physiological limits and performance at high altitude. He was Professor and Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, Washington from 1978 to 1993. His life was a link of medicine and mountaineering. Hornbein was an early Boulder, Colorado, area climber on the Flatirons. Hornbein and his partners Willi Unsoeld and Dick Emerson attempted to climb Mount Everest in 1963 as part of the American Everest Expedition. Jim Whittaker and Nawang Gombu Sherpa from this expedition had summitted on May 1, 1963. Hornbein, Unsoeld, and Emerson were the first to attempt an ascent of the daunting West Ridge. Previously, ascents of the mountain had been made only via the South Col and Southeast Ridge or the North Col and Northeast Ridge. Their plan was to climb up the West Ridge and down the Southeast Ridge/South Col route. This would make theirs the first traverse of an 8000-meter peak.Unsworth, Walt. (1981) Everest. Allen Lane (Penguin Books) . pp 363-392 On May 22, 1963 at 6:50 a.m. they left their final camp and started the climb (Emerson stayed at the high camp due to altitude sickness), and even though progress was very slow made it to the summit at 6:15 that night. They found themselves hours behind the generally accepted schedule and after spending 20 minutes at the top they began the descent. Shortly after they started Unsoeld ran out of oxygen. At 9:30 they came upon two other Americans from the same expedition, Barry Bishop and Lute Jerstad. Bishop and Jerstad had reached the summit earlier in the day using the South Col route and by this time were exhausted and nearly out of oxygen. The four climbers joined together on the descent and continued to make very slow progress until they felt it was too dangerous and stopped sometime after midnight.Ullman, James Ramsey. (1963) Americans on Everest. J.B. Lippincott, Philadelphia They huddled together until 4:00 a.m. and started down again, meeting expedition members carrying extra tanks of oxygen. They made it to camp to find Unsoeld‚Äôs feet hard and frostbitten. Barry Bishop and Lute Jerstad also suffered from frostbite and Bishop and Unsoeld lost toes as a result. Hornbein wrote about this night event in his book \\"Everest: The West Ridge\\": \\"The night was overwhelming empty. The black silhouette of the Lhotse Mountain was lurking there, half to see, half to assume, and below of us. In general there was nothing ‚Äì simply nothing. We hung in a timeless gap, pained by an intensive cold air ‚Äì and had the idea not to be able to do anything but to shiver and to wait for the sun arising.\\"Hornbein, Thomas F. (July 1998). Everest: The West Ridge. Mountaineers Books. Hornbein named the Hornbein Couloir, a gap/track in the utmost upper part of the north wall, which Hornbein and Unsoeld passed. In his book Into Thin Air, Jon Krakauer writes that \\"Hornbein's and Unsoeld's ascent was--and continues to be--deservedly hailed as one of the great feats in the annals of mountaineering.\\" In the year 2002 Hornbein, 72 years old, was still active as a Professor of Anesthesiology and as a mountaineer. In 2006, he moved from the Seattle area to Estes Park, CO, where he lives with his wife, Kathy Mikesell Hornbein, a retired pediatrician and young adult novelist. They climb regularly in the Colorado Rockies.  Awards  On April 14, 2018, Hornbein was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by The Mountaineers (club), a Seattle-based mountaineering club and publisher of mountaineering books.

It is based on a database he has compiled at the University of Chicago, where he directs the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST). The book's conclusions are based on data from 315 suicide terrorism attacks around the world from 1980 through 2003. Of these, 301 were classified into 18 different campaigns by 11 different militant groups; the remaining 14 appear to have been isolated. Published in May 2005, Pape's volume has been widely noticed by the press, the public, and policymakers alike, and has earned praise from the likes of Peter Bergen, Congressman Ron Paul (R-Texas),Paul, Ron (2005-07-14) Suicide Terrorism, LewRockwell.com and Michael Scheuer.Scheuer, Michael (2005-06-10) Throwing America a Life Preserver, AntiWar.com Dying to Win is divided into three parts, analyzing the strategic, social, and psychological dimension of suicide terrorism. Detailed synopsisIntroduction=Chapter 1: The Growing Threat Pape claims to have compiled the world's first \\"database of every suicide bombing and attack around the globe from 1980 through 2003‚Äî315 attacks in all\\" (3). \\"The data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any one of the world's religions. ... Rather, what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common is a specific secular and strategic goal: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland\\" (4). It is important that Americans understand this growing phenomenon (4‚Äì7). Chapter 2: Explaining Suicide Terrorism Caveat: the book's conclusions do not hold for terrorism in general (8‚Äì9). Pape distinguishes among demonstrative terrorism, which seeks publicity, destructive terrorism, which seeks to exert coercion through the threat of injury and death as well as to mobilize support, and suicide terrorism, which involves an attacker's actually killing himself or herself along with others, generally as part of a campaign (9‚Äì11). Three historical episodes are introduced for purposes of comparison: the ancient Jewish Zealots (11‚Äì12; see also 33‚Äì34), the 11th-12th-century Ismaili Assassins (12‚Äì13; see also 34‚Äì35), and the Japanese kamikazes (13; see also 35‚Äì37). Pape had graduate students fluent in many languages scour the international press for incidents of suicide terrorism. There was no suicide terrorism from 1945 to 1980 (13‚Äì14). They found 315 incidents, beginning with the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing (14). They were able to classify all but 14 of the incidents into 18 different campaigns by 10 different organizations of predominantly Muslim, Hindu or Sikh religious persuasion. These included the Tamil Tigers (July 1990), the Israeli occupation of Palestine (1994), Persian Gulf (1995), Turkey (1996), Chechnya (2000), Kashmir (2000), and the U.S. (2001) (14‚Äì15). Five campaigns were still ongoing in early 2004, when Dying to Win was being written (15‚Äì16). Traditional explanations for suicide terrorism focus on individual motives, but fail to explain the specificity of suicide terrorism (16‚Äì17). Economic explanation of this phenomenon yields \\"poor\\" results (17‚Äì19). Explanation of suicide terrorism as a form of competition between radical groups is dubious (19‚Äì20). Pape proposes an alternative explanation of the \\"causal logic of suicide terrorism\\": at the strategic level, suicide terrorism exerts coercive power against democratic states to cease occupation of territory terrorists consider homeland, while at the social level it depends on mass support and at the individual level it is motivated by altruism (20‚Äì23). All 18 campaigns shared two elements: (1) a foreign occupation (2) by a democracy. Only one of the 10 groups shared a religion with the occupiers: the Kurdistan Workers' Party in Turkey. \\"The bottom line, then, is that suicide terrorism is mainly a response to foreign occupation\\" (23). =Part I: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism=Chapter 3: A Strategy for Weak Actors The willingness of an attacker to die has strategic value (27‚Äì29). As a weapon of weak groups incapable of \\"denial\\" as a \\"coercive strategy,\\" suicide terrorism relies on punishment and, especially, \\"the expectation of future damage,\\" which provides coercive leverage (29‚Äì33). Chapter 4: Targeting Democracies Pape claims that his research reveals that the key to understanding the phenomenon of suicide attacks is not religion, but that they \\"compel democracies to withdraw military forces from the terrorists' national homeland\\" (38). Patterns of timing (39‚Äì41), nationalist goals (42‚Äì44), and the targeting of democracies (44‚Äì45) reveal its logical, not irrational, nature. \\"At bottom, suicide terrorism is a strategy for national liberation from foreign military occupation by a democratic state\\" (45). Foreign occupation is defined in terms of control of territory (not military occupation alone) (46). The targets selected by suicide terrorists suggests nationalist, not religious, aims (46‚Äì47). Hamas (47‚Äì51) and Al-Qaeda (51‚Äì58) are analyzed in some detail. In general, the harshness of occupation does not strongly correlate with suicide terrorism (58‚Äì60). Chapter 5: Learning Terrorism Pays Terrorists are predisposed to attribute success to their technique whenever plausible (62‚Äì64). Pape claims that \\"recent suicide terrorist campaigns ... are associated with gains for the terrorists' political causes about half the time\\" (64‚Äì65). Hamas's success is difficult to evaluate, but Hamas spokespersons express belief in their own success (65‚Äì73). Terrorists learn from each other; the spread of the method is therefore neither irrational nor surprising (73‚Äì75). But suicide terrorism has failed \\"to compel target democracies to abandon goals central to national wealth or security\\" (75‚Äì76). =Part II: The Social Logic of Suicide Terrorism=Chapter 6: Occupation and Religious Difference \\"[T]he taproot of suicide terrorism is nationalism\\" not religion (79). It is \\"an extreme strategy for national liberation\\" (80). This explains how the local community can be persuaded to re-define acts of suicide and murder as acts of martyrdom on behalf of the community (81‚Äì83). Pape proposes a nationalist theory of suicide terrorism, seen from the point of view of terrorists. He analyzes the notions of occupation (83‚Äì84), homeland (84‚Äì85), identity (85‚Äì87), religious difference as a contributor to a sense of \\"alien\\" occupation (87‚Äì88), foreign occupation reverses the relative importance of religion and language (88‚Äì92), and the widespread perception of the method as a \\"last resort\\" (92‚Äì94). A statistical demonstration leads to the conclusion that a \\"linear\\" rather than \\"self- reinforcing spiral\\" explanation of suicide terrorism is best (94‚Äì100). However, different future developments of the phenomenon of suicide terrorism are very possible, and more study of the role of religion is needed (101). Chapter 7: Demystifying al-Qaeda With increasing knowledge of al- Qaeda, we see that \\"the presence of American military forces for combat operations on the homeland territory of the suicide terrorists is stronger than Islamic fundamentalism in predicting whether individuals from that country will become al-Qaeda suicide terrorists\\" (103). \\"Al-Qaeda is less a transnational network of like-minded ideologues ... than a cross-national military alliance of national liberation movements working together against what they see as a common imperial threat\\" (104). The nature of Salafism, a Sunni form of Islamic fundamentalism, is complex (105‚Äì07). Statistical analysis fails to corroborate Salafism-terrorism connection, but it does corroborate a connection to U.S. military policies in the Persian Gulf (107‚Äì17). Al-Qaeda propaganda emphasizes the \\"Crusader\\" theme, which is inherently related to occupation (117‚Äì24). Pape concludes that \\"the core features of al-Qaeda\\" are captured by his theory (125). Chapter 8: Suicide Terrorist Organizations around the Globe Robert Pape examines other campaigns to see if the \\"dynamics that make religious difference important\\" are present in other terrorist campaigns, acknowledging the difficulty of the inquiry (126‚Äì29). He offers detailed analyses of Lebanon (129‚Äì39), Sri Lanka (139‚Äì54), the Sikhs in Punjab (154‚Äì62), and the Kurdish PKK in Turkey (162‚Äì66). His conclusion: \\"Religion plays a role in suicide terrorism, but mainly in the context of national resistance\\" and not Islam per se but \\"the dynamics of religious difference\\" are what matter (166‚Äì67). =Part III: The Individual Logic of Suicide Terrorism=Chapter 9: Altruism and Terrorism Pape presents a Durkheimian analysis of suicide (173‚Äì79). \\"Many acts of suicide terrorism are a murderous form of what Durkheim calls altruistic suicide\\" (179). Analytical difficulties are acknowledged (180‚Äì81). Pape uses suicide rates in general as points of comparison (181‚Äì84). Team suicide, which is frequent in suicide terrorism, is an indicator of altruistic suicide, he argues (185‚Äì87). Altruistic suicide is a socially constructed phenomenon (187‚Äì88): e.g., Hezbollah in Lebanon (188‚Äì91), Hamas (191‚Äì93), Tamil Tigers (193‚Äì95); al-Qaeda (195‚Äì96). The altruistic nature of suicide terrorism suggests the number of potential terrorists is large, that suicide terrorism is capable of growing in attractiveness and appeal, and that any attempt at profiling will miss a substantial number of potential suicide terrorists (197‚Äì98). Chapter 10: The Demographic Profile of Suicide Terrorists \\"In general, suicide attackers are rarely socially isolated, clinically insane, or economically destitute individuals, but are most often educated, socially integrated, and highly capable people who could be expected to have a good future\\" (200). Pape discusses problems of data-gathering (201‚Äì02). He establishes 462 individuals in his \\"universe\\" of suicide terrorists available for analytical purposes (203). Hezbollah suicide bombers in the period 1982‚Äì1986 were 71% Communist/Socialist, 21% Islamist, 8% Christian (204‚Äì07). In general, suicide terrorists are in their early 20s (207‚Äì08). Females are fewer in Islamist groups: \\"Islamist fundamentalism may actually reduce the number of suicide terrorists by discouraging certain categories of individuals\\" (208‚Äì09). Female suicide terrorists tend to be older than male (209‚Äì10). There is no documented mental illness in any case of suicide terrorism, though there are 16 cases of personal trauma (e.g., the loss of a loved one) (210‚Äì11). Arab suicide terrorists are in general better educated than average and are from the working or middle classes (211‚Äì16). \\"[T]hey resemble the kind of politically conscious individuals who might join a grassroots movement more than they do wayward adolescents or religious fanatics\\" (216). Chapter 11: Portraits of Three Suicide Terrorists Earlier work has tended to emphasize suicide terrorists' irrationality, but this generalization fit 1980s data better than more recent data (217‚Äì20). Pape looks at three individual cases: Mohamed Atta (220‚Äì26); Dhanu, a young woman from Jaffna, \\"the most famous Tamil Tiger suicide bomber\\" (226‚Äì30); and Saeed Hotari, of Hamas (231‚Äì34). =Conclusion=Chapter 12: A New Strategy for Victory Though \\"we\\" cannot leave the Middle East altogether, Pape asserts, a \\"strategy for victory\\" is available (237‚Äì38). U.S. should define victory as the separate objectives of \\"defeating the current pool of terrorists\\" and preventing a new generation from arising (238‚Äì39). He rejects Frum-Perle view that the root of the problem is in Islam (241‚Äì44). \\"Rather, the taproot is American military policy\\" (244). The notion that Islamic fundamentalism is bent on world domination is \\"pure fantasy\\" (244‚Äì45). An attempt by the West to force Muslim societies to transform \\"is likely to dramatically increase the threat we face\\" (245). He calls for a policy of \\"'off-shore' balancing\\": establishing local alliances while maintaining the capacity for rapid deployment of military forces (247‚Äì50). =Appendices=Appendix I: Suicide Terrorist Campaigns, 1980‚Äì2003 Analysis of 18 campaigns. Appendix II: Occupations by Democratic States, 1980‚Äì2003 Fifty-eight occupations by democratic states are listed (265‚Äì67). Appendix III: Salafism in Major Sunni Muslim Majority Countries Thirty-four countries with Sunni majority populations of 1 m or more and the importance of Salafism in these countries are the subjects of brief commentaries. Salafism is defined as \\"the belief that society should be organized according to the Quran and Sunna only\\" (269). _Sunni Countries with Salafi-Influenced Populations_ : Afghanistan (10 m Pashtuns); Algeria (19 m/31m Sunni Muslims); Bangladesh (14 m/114m); Egypt (23 m/62m); Indonesia (26 m/185m); Jordan (2 m/6m); Nigeria (37 m/68m); Oman (2 m/2m); Pakistan (43 m/149m); Saudi Arabia (18 m/18m); Somalia (5 m/10m); Sudan (21 m/21m); Tunisia (5 m/10m); Yemen (8 m/11m) (270‚Äì74). Non- Salafi Sunni Countries: Albania, Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan (274‚Äì77). Critiques In a criticism of Pape's link between occupation and suicide terrorism, an article titled \\"Design, Inference, and the Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism\\" (published in The American Political Science Review), authors Scott Ashworth, Joshua D. Clinton, Adam Meirowitz, and Kristopher W. Ramsay from Princeton charge Pape with \\"sampling on the dependent variable\\" by limiting research only to cases in which suicide terror was used:American Political Science Review, Volume 102, Issue 02, May 2008, pp 269-273. Pape's analysis has no control group. Appendix II lists 58 occupations by democracies, only 9 of which generated suicide terrorism. An analysis explaining the difference between the 9 with suicide terrorism and the 49 without is lacking. In response, Pape argues that his research design is sufficient because it collected the universe of known cases of suicide terrorism.American Political Science Review, Volume 102, Issue 02, May 2008, pp 275-277. In a rejoinder, Ashworth et al. discuss how even large samples of the dependent variable cannot be used to explain variation in outcomes, why suicide terrorism in some places but not others, if the sample does not vary.Design, Inference, and the Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism: A Rejoinder, https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/rejoinder3.pdf In a debate hosted by the Washington Institute, Martin Kramer argued that Pape's thesis was less relevant to Al Qaeda than to Lebanon and Palestine and that there were only 12,000 American troops in Saudi Arabia in 2001 and they had not caused any deaths. In response Pape argued that \\"The U.S.-led war on terrorism is going badly because it is being waged on a faulty premise. That premise is that suicide terrorism is mainly a product of Islamic fundamentalism.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Downloadable audio interview with Scott Horton * Chicago Project on Security and Threats * It's the Occupation Stupid by Robert A.

In 1954, the Duke of Norfolk, acting in his capacity as Earl Marshal, issued letters patent granting arms to the city of Ottawa. The city formally declared the use of the arms in force as of 1 January of the following year. Upon amalgamation of the city of Ottawa with surrounding municipalities in 2001, the new City Council requested that the arms be reissued to the newly formed municipality. In March of that year, the Canadian Heraldic Authority issued a new grant of arms. The new arms are exactly the same as the old. Symbolism Crest :The white pine is the historical basis of the economic power of the Ottawa Valley, while the small badge on the tree refers to Bytown, the town that later became the city of Ottawa. Shield :The main element of the shield, the wavy blue and white lines, represent the Ottawa River running from left to right with the Rideau and Gatineau rivers represented above and below. A royal crown alludes to Queen Victoria's choice of Ottawa as Canada's capital, while the maple leaf is the national emblem of Canada.

Auguste-Laurent Burdeau (10 September 185112 December 1894) was a French politician. He was the son of a laborer at Lyon. Forced from childhood to earn his own living, he was enabled to secure an education by bursarships at the Lyc√©e at Lyon and at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. In 1870 he was at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, but enlisted in the army, and was wounded and made prisoner in 1871 (during the Franco-Prussian War). In 1874 he became professor of philosophy, and translated several works of Herbert Spencer and of Schopenhauer into French. His extraordinary aptitude for work secured for him the position of chef de cabinet under Paul Bert, the minister of education, in 1880s. In 1885 he was elected deputy for the d√©partement of the Rh√¥ne, and distinguished himself in financial questions.
