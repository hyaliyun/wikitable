In a racing career which lasted from October 2007 to October 2009 the filly ran nine times and won two races. After winning her only race as a two-year-old, Look Here finished second on her three-year-old debut. She then won the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom, in which she was a 33/1 outsider. Look Here never won another race, but finished third in the St Leger Stakes, Coronation Cup and Pretty Polly Stakes. Background Look Here is a bay mare with a white star bred by her owner, Julian Richmond-Watson's Lawn Stud in Northamptonshire, England. Richmond-Watson, the senior steward of the Jockey Club, operated on a small scale: at the time he had only four mares at stud. Look Here was sired by the French stallion Hernando, who won the Prix du Jockey Club and finished second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a breeding stallion, his best known offspring is the multiple Group One winner Sulamani. Look Here was one of seven winners produced by her unraced dam Last Look. The filly was trained throughout her career by Ralph Beckett at Whitsbury, Hampshire. Racing career =2007: two-year-old season= Look Here made her first and only appearance of 2006 at Salisbury Racecourse in October. She started a 16/1 outsider for the Southampton Maiden Stakes, a one- mile race open to colts and fillies, with the colt Doctor Fremantle being made 1/3 favourite. Ridden by Kerrin McAvoy, Look Here took the lead inside the last quarter mile and stayed out the distance well to beat Doctor Fremantle by two and a half lengths. =2008: three-year-old season= On her three-year- old debut, Look Here was sent to contest the Listed Oaks Trial Stakes at Lingfield Park, where she was ridden for the first time by Seb Sanders. After being restrained in the early stages she finished strongly to take second place, three quarters of a length behind Miracle Seeker. Sanders later admitted that he had given the filly a poorly judged ride. The 2008 running of the Epsom Oaks appeared likely to be dominated by Irish-trained fillies: the Jim Bolger-trained Lush Lashes started favourite ahead of Katiyra (John Oxx) and Chinese White (Dermot Weld), whilst Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle stable was represented by five runners. Only two of the sixteen runners started at longer odds than the 33/1 shot Look Here. Sanders settled his filly in the middle of the field before moving forward in the straight. Look Here took the lead two furlongs from the finish and went clear of the field, winning comfortably by three and three quarter lengths from Moonstone and Katiyra. The win was a first in a Classic for both Beckett and Sanders. Look Here was off the racecourse for more than three months before returning in September for the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. She had been prevented from running in the Yorkshire Oaks by a training setback in August. Racing against twelve colts and one other filly, Look Here was made 11/4 second favourite for the one and three quarter mile classic, behind Aidan O'Brien's irish Derby winner Frozen Fire. Ridden by Eddie Ahern, Look Here made steady progress in the straight but could never raech the lead and finished third behind Conduit and Unsung Heroine, beaten more than six lengths by the winner. =2009: four- year-old season= Look Here stayed in training as a four-year-old, but failed to win in five races. Her best performance came on her seasonal debut in the Coronation Cup over the Oaks course and distance. Sanders held the filly up at the back of the field before challenging on the outside in the straight. She finished strongly but was beaten in a three-way photo finish by Ask and Youmzain. Later in June Look Here was sent to Ireland and started favourite for the Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh Racing over a mile and a quarter for the first time, she finished third to Dar Re Mi. Beckett explained that the filly was unsuited by the very soft ground. She made little impact in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July, finishing unplaced behind Conduit. Look Here was dropped to Group Three class for her next start in the Arc Trial at Newbury but after leading in the straight she was caught in the last stride and beaten a short head by Doctor Fremantle, the colt she had beaten on her racecourse debut. In October, Look Here traveled to Canada for the E. P. Taylor Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack. She finished unplaced behind Lahaleeb; she was subsequently retired from racing without another victory after the 2008 Epsom Oaks. Assessment and honours In the 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings, Look Here was given a rating of 119, making her the highest-rated British filly of her generation, and the equal third best three-year-old filly in the world behind Zarkava (128) and Goldikova (125). Stud record Look Here retired to Lawn Stud to become a broodmare for Julian Richmond-Watson at his Wakefield Lodge Estate.

The SSSI is a relatively small area of the much larger nature reserve of RSPB Nagshead, which is a site owned and managed by the RSPB and the Forestry Commission. The SSSI lies to the east of the Nagshead Plantation and consists of two units of assessment by Natural England. The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).Forest of Dean District Local Plan Review, adopted November 2005, Appendix D 'Nature Conservation Site Designations Within the Forest of Dean District', Key Wildlife Sites History The woodland in the Forest of Dean has been managed for timber for a significant time. As a consequence there is a variety of woodland types as a result of the woodland management. The central area of woodland is in the Coal Measures and this area supports oak with restricted ground flora. This is an acidic area. Around it are the limestone and Old Red Sandstone rocks. These provide soils which are more fertile and a richer ground flora. The Nagshead site is one of three sites in the Forest of Dean which are of national nature conservation importance. It is an excellent example of broad-leaved woodland and is of major ornithological importance. The oldest part of the site was planted in 1814 and includes pedunculate oak and sessile oak. Understorey The ground flora of the understorey varies dependent upon whether the woodland is grazed by sheep. A dense shrub layer which is dominated by holly and rowan occurs in the ungrazed areas. Grazed areas are more open. Herb layers consists of bramble, bracken, softgrass and tufted hair grass. wood sorrel and bluebell are locally abundant. Ponds and streams The Cannop Brook runs within the site and there are semi-natural area of woodland (mostly alder). The diversity of the habitat is enhanced by small ponds and streams and there are rarer plants reported such as heath spotted orchid and broad-leaved helleborine. Birdlife This is an area which is rich in bird life and there are established populations of breeding pied flycatcher, wood warbler and redstart. There has been long established research into the breeding biology of various birds at Nagshead and there is a nestbox scheme managed by the RSPB. Invertebrates Butterflies are attracted by the open rides and recordings including white admiral, pearl-bordered fritillary and purple hairstreak. The Cannop Brook supports a good range of woodland invertebrates. Conservation The unit reports for 2009 indicate the need for a watching brief on the presence of sweet chestnut and sycamore. Implications of the lack of grazing are noted and how this may affect the woodland structure necessary for some breeding birds.Natural England reports on the units of assessment References SSSI Source * Natural England SSSI information on the citation * Natural England SSSI information on the Nagshead units  External links  *Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) *Forestry Commission *Natural England (SSSI information) Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1972 Category:Nature reserves in Gloucestershire Category:Forest of Dean Category:Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reserves in England ","title":"Nagshead SSSI"},{"id":"36722062","text":"Ny Troor Tromode ( or Yn Troor) was a Manx nationalist group charged with 17 counts of crimes including arson and criminal damage.

He assisted with the escape of Charles II after the Battle of Worcester in September 1651. Penderel was born in Tong, Shropshire, of yeoman stock, the third son of William Penderel. His family were Catholic, and were the tenants of the farm of Hobbal Grange in Tong. Their landlord was another Catholic, Basil Fitzherbert of Boscobel House, about away. Richard Penderel was the life tenant of the farm by 1651, by which time it is assumed that his father had already died. Early in the morning of 4 September 1651, Penderel was summoned to meet the king, Charles II, at White Ladies Priory, in Shropshire, shortly after Charles had fled from the field of the Battle of Worcester. Penderel's second eldest brother John and youngest brother George were servants at the priory, while another brother Humphrey ran the mill nearby. Richard Penderel was charged with protecting the king. He disguised Charles as a woodman, \\"William Jones\\", giving him a rough haircut and some of Penderel's own clothes, and hid Charles in a coppice while it rained during the rest of the day. He took Charles to his farmhouse that evening, before starting on the journey to Wales. In the morning, they sought shelter at Madeley from Francis Wolfe, another Catholic of Penderel's acquaintance, but finding the crossings of the River Severn were guarded by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers, they returned to Hobbal Grange on Saturday 5 September. Charles travelled on to Boscobel House, where Penderel's eldest brother William was caretaker. William Penderel provided Charles with a ladder to hide along with Colonel William Careless in the Royal Oak (sometimes known as \\"Penderel's Oak\\") and distracted the soldiers who were searching for him. John Penderell happened to meet Father John Huddleston who suggested the King should go to Moseley Hall on the night of 7 September, Huddleston cleaned and bandaged the King's sore feet there. On 9 September, Parliamentary troops arrived on a search and questioned the owner of the house Thomas Whitgreave, while the King and Huddleston were hiding there in a priest hole. The troops were persuaded that Whitgreave had not fought at Worcester in 1645 even though he had, and been captured at Naseby. The troops were persuaded to leave without searching the house. On 12 September, the five Penderel brothers formed the bodyguard of the king on his overnight journey from Boscobel House to Moseley Hall near Wolverhampton, with the king riding on Humphrey's old mill horse. Isaac Fuller, King Charles II at Whiteladies, c.1660 Penderel was suspected of Royalist sympathies during the Commonwealth, but kept a low profile and was left unmolested. He was rewarded on the Restoration, welcomed at Charles II's court in June 1660. He was given a reward of ¬£200 and an annuity of ¬£100 for him and his heirs in April 1662. Penderel contracted a fever and died while visiting London, and was buried at St Giles-in-the-Fields. He was survived by his other brothers, who all benefitted from royal patronage. They all received pensions, and royal exemption from prosecutions for recusancy after the Popish Plot.

Personal life Guillermo S√∂hnlein was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on May 18, 1966. He immigrated to the United States in 1972 with his family, who settled in the area of San Jose, California, where he attended St. Francis High School in Mountain View. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1986. He graduated in December 1989 from the University of California at Berkeley with an A.B. in economics, and in May 1995 he earned a J.D. from the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, where he was Editor-in-Chief of the West-Northwest Journal of Environmental Law and Policy From 1995 to 1999, he served in the United States Marine Corps, achieving the rank of Captain. He has three children: Rebecca Lynn S√∂hnlein (b January 30, 1999), Daniel Jacob S√∂hnlein (b. March 20, 2001), and Caleb Miguel S√∂hnlein (b. March 1, 2005). In 2011, S√∂hnlein was accepted as a Fellow of Opus Novum, a group committed to professional conduct guided by Seven Principles and to the notion that global problems can be resolved only through cooperation among nonprofit, for-profit, and government partners. In 2012, he was accepted as a member of The Explorers Club.  Technology  In 1998, S√∂hnlein co-founded Milo, a speech recognition technology company that was acquired by Voxeo in 2001. After relocating to the Northern Virginia region outside Washington, D.C., he worked with a number of technology startup ventures,http://www.nvtc.org/documents/magazine/julyaug04.pdf and advised several technology-related investment groups, incubators, and economic development agencies, and gave frequent talks about the field. including projects in China and Qatar. In 2009, he co-founded iSpaces, which developed a cloud-based operating system and suite of applications. After two years of development, its public beta release went live in 2012.  Space commercialization  In 2003, S√∂hnlein founded the International Association of Space Entrepreneurs[ (IASE), a nonprofit organization created to encourage successful entrepreneurs from other industries to start aerospace-related ventures. The group grew from 5 people to almost 1,500 individuals around the world. In 2010, the online community was transferred to the Space Frontier Foundation for ongoing growth, and IASE officially disbanded. In 2006, he founded Space Angels Network, a for-profit angel investor group for early- stage aerospace ventures. Founding members included Esther Dyson, Stephen Fleming, David S. Rose, and Ed Tuck. In April 2007, Burton Lee joined as co- founder, and the two led the group's Aerospace Venture Forums showcasing entrepreneurial ventures for prospective investors. In 2010, Joe Landon took over as managing director, and under his leadership the group announced its first four investment deals during 2011-2012. As of early 2013, the group consisted of approximately 30 investor members living across the United States and Europe and more than 100 young companies that had applied for funding.  Ocean exploration  In 2009, S√∂hnlein co-founded OceanGate, Inc., a venture that provides deep-sea manned submersibles. It owns and operates Antipodes (submarine), a five-person manned submersible with a depth rating of 305 meters (1,000 feet) and twin 58\\" hemispherical acrylic domes fore and aft on its cylindrical hull. During 2010-2012, he helped organize five submarine exploration expeditions to Santa Catalina Island in California, Puget Sound in Washington, Monterey Bay (twice) in California, and Miami in Florida. In 2010, he re-launched the Ocean Exploration Committee of the Marine Technology Society, a nonprofit membership association supporting students and industry professionals in marine-related fields. In 2011, he co-founded the OceanGate Foundation, now ExploreOcean, a nonprofit organization that conducts outreach programs on about manned submersibles. During October 2011, it conducted a program in Monterey, California, that reached almost 2,000 local students, teachers, and community leaders. During March 2012, it conducted a 10-day educational program in Miami, Florida. Over 1,000 students participated in the program's presentations and submarine tours. In 2013, he founded Blue Marble Exploration, which organized high-profile expeditions to explore the oceans in manned submersibles. These expeditions were intended to push the limits of technology, science, operations, and human endurance in order to raise public awareness of the world's oceans.  Sea-Space Connections  In 2011, he founded the Sea-Space Initiative, a global project to provide collaboration in ocean and space industries. The first program, launched in May 2012, is the Sea-Space Summit, a global series of invitation-only workshops.

Birth and education Sergei Aleksandrovich Tokarev was born in Tula on 29 December 1899. He graduated with honors from Tula grammar school and entered Moscow University. Immediately after the revolution, conditions in Moscow in 1918 were dangerous and difficult, and Tokarev went back to the apparent safety of his home province of Tula. He taught Russian and Latin in local schools for four years. Tokarev returned to Moscow University in 1922, where he began social and historical studies. He received a state scholarship, and supplemented his income by giving private lessons. In 1924 he obtained a job as a bibliographer at the Central Library. After graduating on 25 June 1925, Tokarev applied to continue research in the university's graduate Institute of History. He submitted a thesis on \\"totemic society\\", a fully-fledged work of research. His application was supported by a short but very flattering recommendation from Viacheslav Petrovich Volgin. Accepted in November 1925, Tokarev was enrolled in the Institute in January 1926, joining what later became the ethnology section. In the spring of 1926 Tokarev presented a report on Australian totemism. In the 1926/1927 academic year he prepared a report on Melanesian religions and gave a talk on Australian kinship systems. In June 1927 Tokarev presented a report on the economic structure of English Manors in the 13th to 15th centuries. In 1927/1928 Tokarev returned to the Melanesian theme with a report on the social system of these people. His post-graduate training was completed in 1929, although officially he did not graduate until 1 January 1930. Early career Tokarev began working at the Central Museum of Ethnology in October 1927. In 1928, he joined the department of colonies at the museum, and in 1931 he was appointed head of the department of North Asia. As a graduate student, in 1928/1929 he also taught part-time at Moscow University, and taught a course on the history of social structures at the Sun Yat-sen University of Communist Workers of China. Ethnography was considered important in the early years of the Soviet Union, which had a great many different ethnic groups, and the first university courses for professional ethnography were launched in the 1920s. However, by the latter part of the decade, Marxist radicals attacked the discipline for being \\"bourgeois\\", and some of the main ethnographic institutions were closed in April 1929. Ethnography became redefined as the study of prehistoric peoples. The University's Institute of History became part of the Communist Academy. Most positions went only to Marxists and communists, although in some circumstances non-Marxist scholars could be admitted. The Marxist linguist Valerian Borisovich Aptekar was an opponent of traditional ethnography, strongly expressing his opinion in a debate on 7 May 1928. He argued that the subject was not scientific, that its concepts were vague, and that by treating the development of mankind in terms of the evolution of cultural forms the ethnographers denied the more fundamental forces of production and class struggle. The subject could only be approached in terms of dialectical materialism. Tokarev disagreed publicly. Although he accepted the need for a more scientific approach and for the subject to be treated from a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist viewpoint, he defended the study of ethnology as dealing with realities that could not be ignored. Further debates were held at meetings of the AMI in April 1929 and in June 1930. Tokarev was still working at the museum, and the authorities frowned on people holding two positions. He was dismissed from the institute on 1 May 1931 but continued as a free-lance researcher and retained the more secure job at the Museum. Despite the political climate, Tokarev undertook valuable work in the late 1920s and the 1930s. He spent less time on Australia and Melanesia and more time on the people of Siberia and Yakutia, perhaps due to political pressure, although he was always interested in both subjects. He made his first field trip in September 1928 in Turkmenistan, and in 1930 visited the Altai Mountains. The museum supported another expedition to the Altais in 1932, and he returned in 1940, just before the war. In 1934 he made an expedition to Yakutia, which had great influence on the development of his ideas. During the 1930s and the Great Purge, Stalin sent many Soviet intellectuals to labor in the gulags. Yeleazar Meletinsky, often called Zorya, was among those imprisoned. He left his manuscript The Hero of the Fairy Tale with Tokarev, who preserved it for publication years later. A crisis in Tokarev's career came on 20 August 1936 during the Trotsky-Zinoviev show trials, when meetings to denounce Trotsky and Zinoviev were arranged across the country. Tokarev publicly said that if the Trotskyite-Zinovievite faction had come to power they would have continued the communist party's political and economic policies, and argued in defense of his position. He was accused of taking a counter-revolutionary stance. On 21 August Tokarev was brought before the museum's Party Committee, and on 22 August a general staff meeting reviewed the speech. Tokarev spoke in his own defense but was dismissed from the museum, although he suffered no other punishment. Later career Tokarev retained his position at the State Academy of the History of Material Culture, where he had worked since 1932 as a Research Fellow in the Department of Feudalism. In October 1938 he rejoined the museum as an ethnographer and consultant. Until 1941, he was also a research associate at the Central Anti-religious museum. In 1939 Tokarev was appointed professor in the newly organized Department of Ethnography, History Department of Moscow State University, a position he held until 1973. From 1939 to 1941 he also lectured on ethnography at the Moscow Institute of History, Philosophy and Literature. In 1940 Tokarev defended his doctoral dissertation \\"The social system of the Yakuts in the 17th-18th centuries.\\" In World War II, he was evacuated from Moscow in June 1941, and headed the history department of Abakan Teachers' Institute. In 1943 he returned to Moscow and was awarded the title of professor, working as a section head of the Institute of Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1951‚Äì1952, Tokarev was the first ethnographer from the Soviet Union to teach in the universities of Berlin and Leipzig. He went to Berlin in 1951 as a guest of the Finno-Ugrian Institute. His visit may have been arranged by Wolfgang Steinitz, a Jewish specialist in Finno-Ugrian languages who had emigrated from Germany to the Soviet Union in 1933. Tokarev lectured in the German Democratic Republic, stressing how important it was to study social and cultural changes that were occurring in both urban and rural areas. He said the goal of ethnology must be to describe and understand the \\"way of life\\" of the people being studied, and the changes that occurred to the way of life. From 1961 Tokarev headed up the institute's sector on the ethnography of non- Soviet nations in Europe. At the same time from 1956 to 1973 he was in charge of the Department of Ethnography within the History Department of Moscow State University. Under his leadership the department grew and expanded its scope of study. In particular, the study of Slavic, Siberian, Central Asian and African peoples, the history of these peoples and the history of primitive religions and of shamanism were points of attention. Tokarev died in Moscow on 19 April 1985. Scientific activities =Ethnology= Tokarev was a follower of Aleksandr Nikolaevich Maksimov, who had undertaken early studies of Siberian and Australian hunter-gatherers. Maksimov believed that an ethnologist should not restrict himself to \\"primitive\\" people, but should study people at all stages of development. Tokarev had extremely broad ethnographical interests, and was particularly intrigued by early forms of religion. He wrote about the peoples of Australia, Oceania, America and Europe, and about the Yakuts and the Altay people of Siberia. He wrote about how ethnology had evolved in Russia and in the west. Tokarev conformed to Soviet Marxist ideology and Russian nationalist views in his study of the history of anthropology. Joseph Stalin, who took power in the Soviet Union in 1924, imposed rigid constraints on the study of ethnography that were lifted only after his death in 1953. Tokarev's work continued to advocate a Marxist ethnography. According to a pupil, Tokarev said once that the Australian Aborigines were In the 1920s, Tokarev was one of the first to try to create a conventional code for recording the meaning of kinship terms. He noted that it was misleading for a scholar to simply translate terms used by a people being studied into terms used by the scholar. He tried to define a system that used the numbers 1‚Äì6 to represent father, mother, son, daughter, husband and wife, and that reduced all other kinship terms to these basic terms. He recorded new insights in his later work on ethnic groups of the USSR. For example, he noted that while in most Russian villages the witches were male, Ukrainian villages had many more female witches, which he thought might be due to western European influence via Poland. He noted that the Slavonic people, from the steppes, worshipped stones, streams and hills, while the Finno-Ugrian people, from the forests, worshipped trees or groves. Tokarev's study, The Yakut social system in the 17th and 18th century (1945), inquired into the social and land ownership relations of the Sakha people of Yakutia from a Marxist historical perspective. He explored the question of whether the concept of private land ownership existed in Sakha society before the intervention of Russia. He said: But after describing abuses of the colonizers, Tokarev noted that the Sakha prospered and grew in numbers in the longer term, and that other colonial regimes had been much more brutal. This was in line with Soviet propaganda of World War II, when the Soviet government was trying to rally the peoples of the country to form a common front against the German invaders. After the war, there was a resurgence of Russian nationalism in the mid-1950s. In Yakutia from the 1630s to 1917 (1957), published under his direction, the violence, murder, and enslavements are treated as isolated incidents in a generally peaceful movement of Russians into the territory. Leaders of the local people are often characterized as the instigators of the violence. =Religion= Tokarev was interested in \\"primitive\\" religions. He tended to follow Lev Shternberg's evolutionist views, although rejecting some of Shternberg's specific hypotheses. In 1963 he published a general discussion of the subject, Early forms of religion and its development, and religion in the history of nations. In this book, Tokarov concluded that Siberian shamanism had evolved from animism, since the shaman's role was to maintain a close relationship with the spirits of hunted animals. Taking a Marxist view of the religious experience, in the 1980s Tokarev wrote that shamans \\"were almost always mentally ill, with a propensity for fits of madness.\\" This was not a view that most of his colleagues shared by this time, preferring to describe tribal spirituality in terms of \\"primal religion\\". Some of his other ideas about folklore and religion were considered alien, if not outdated, by western scholars. He associated sacred objects with fetishes, and sacred formulae with magic formulae. Tokarev depended on Orthodox missionary scholars for his knowledge of Islam. His 1963 work takes a scientific atheist view of the subject, but betrays his reliance on missionaries as he relates Muslim terms to their Christian equivalents. For example, he describes the Mahdi as \\"the Messiah in Islam\\", and discusses \\"Muslim Clergy\\" and a \\"Muslim Church\\", all concepts that Russian scholars of Islam in the 19th century had understood to be inaccurate. He observed that religion is more about how people relate to each other in relation to religious beliefs, than about the nature of these beliefs. Tokarev's view that religions are more than a theology, and comprise a social force affecting many aspects of people's lives, was controversial among Soviet scholars of religion. He challenged the prevalent negative view at the time, which perceived Islam as a potential tool for the bourgeoisie and reactionaries, and not one that could be used to solve the problems of the masses. He showed that Islam could be used effectively by politicians with secular goals, and that Islamic socialism could be a positive force in the development of contemporary Muslim states. =Later work= In 1959 Tokarev co-authored Narody Ameriki (The people of America) with A. V. Efimov. The introduction noted the book was the first generalized work on the history and ethnography of the peoples of America based on Marxian and Leninist methodology. An American reviewer wrote, Tokarev continued to write and edit prolifically throughout the remainder of his life. With the thaw in Soviet- Chinese relations in the late 1980s, his recent work began to be translated into Chinese. He served as principal editor of the encyclopedia, Myths of the countries of the world. In the introduction he said, \\"Although myth conveys a story, it is not specifically a genre of literary art but only a certain worldview; often it is storytelling, but in other cases, the general mythic worldview expresses itself through rites, dances and songs.\\" Teaching Many of the students to whom Tokarev taught the theory and methodology of foreign ethnography during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s later became Siberianists. Tokarev¬í said that the ethnographic study should not be confined to the straightforward chronicling of material culture. He stressed the human aspects, saying, \\"A material object cannot interest the ethnographer unless he considers its social existence, its relationship to man.\\" He considered that anthropology was \\"a historical science, studying peoples and their way of life and culture.\\" He wrote, \\"Historicism is one of the basic principles of the Marxist method. Any subject, any phenomenon can only have its reality understood and known by approaching it from a historical point of view, by revealing its origin and development.\\" Honors Tokarev was awarded the Double Knight of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1945 and 1979) and Chevalier of the Order of Friendship of Peoples (1975). He was given the Medal \\"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945\\" (1945), and the USSR State Prize in 1987, posthumously. He was named an Honored Scientist of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (1956) and Honored Scientist of Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1971).

The term also refers to the wave function of such a state, which is more formally defined by having an enhancement (i.e. increased norm squared) of an eigenfunction along unstable classical periodic orbits. Since the square-norm of quantum wavefunctions yield probability densities in the Copenhagen interpretation, the two notions correspond. Quantum scars were discovered and explained in 1984 by Eric J. Heller and are part of the large field of quantum chaos. Scars are unexpected in the sense that stationary classical distributions at the same energy are completely uniform in space with no special concentrations along periodic orbits, and quantum chaos theory of energy spectra gave no hint of their existence. Scars stand out to the eye in some eigenstates of classically chaotic systems, but are quantified by projection of the eigenstates onto certain test states, often Gaussians, having both average position and average momentum along the periodic orbit. These test states give a provably structured spectrum that reveals the necessity of scars, especially for the shorter and least unstable periodic orbits. Scars have been found and are important in membranes, wave mechanics, optics, microwave systems, water waves, and electronic motion in microstructures. Scars have occurred in investigations for potential applications of Rydberg states to quantum computing, specifically acting as qubits for quantum simulation. The particles of the system in an alternating ground state-Rydberg state configuration continually entangled and disentangled rather than remaining entangled and undergoing thermalization. Systems of the same atoms prepared with other initial states did thermalize as expected. The researchers dubbed the phenomenon \\"quantum many-body scarring\\". The area of quantum many-body scars is a subject of active research.  Explanation  The causes of quantum scarring are not well understood. One possible proposed explanation is that quantum scars represent integrable systems, or nearly do so, and this could prevent thermalization from ever occurring. This has drawn criticisms arguing that a non-integrable Hamiltonian underlies the theory. Recently, a series of works has related the existence of quantum scarring to an algebraic structure known as dynamical symmetries.  Potential applications to quantum computing  Fault-tolerant quantum computers are desired, as any perturbations to qubit states can cause the states to thermalize, leading to loss of quantum information. Scarring of qubit states is seen as a potential way to protect qubit states from outside disturbances leading to decoherence and information loss.

Jones was a right-handed batsman who was a right-arm bowler, although his bowling style is unknown. He was born at Tattenhall, Cheshire. Jones made his debut for Cheshire against Northumberland in the 1910 Minor Counties Championship at Boughton Hall Cricket Club Ground. He made eighteen appearances in the Minor Counties Championship for Cheshire before World War I, after which he returned to play for the county. He played minor counties cricket for Cheshire from 1920 to 1938, making 139 further appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against the Yorkshire Second XI. He was also Cheshire captain from 1931 to 1934. Playing minor counties cricket for Cheshire allowed Jones to be selected to play for a combined Minor Counties cricket team, with him making a single first-class appearance for the team at the age of 45 against Ireland in 1937 at Observatory Lane, Rathmines. Ireland won the toss and elected to bat first, making 102 all out, with Jones taking the wickets of Frank Quinn and George Crothers, to finish with figures of 2/14 from four overs. The Minor Counties were then dismissed for just 69 in their first-innings, with Jones ending the innings not out on 9. Ireland improved in their second-innings, making 179 all out, with Jones taking five wickets to finish with figures of 5/8 from 6.1 overs. Set 213 for victory, the Minor Counties were dismissed for 113, with Jones making 4 runs before he was dismissed by James Boucher. His brother and nephew, both named William, also played for and captained Cheshire. He died at Chester, Cheshire, on 8 January 1962.

Bridge aims to ensure more children have increased access to a quality education. To achieve this they support government schools and also run community schools. Bridge believes in ongoing teacher training and support, advanced lesson plans and the use of wireless technology to deliver education. They have been a participant in the United Nations Global Compact since September 2017. Bridge runs or supports nearly 2,000 (mainly public/government) schools and has educated a million children in the last decade. It's aiming to educate 10,000,000 pupils by 2025. It currently operates schools in India, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria and Uganda. It is headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya with additional offices in Kampala, Lagos, Monrovia, Vijayawada, London, Boston, and Washington, DC. Through the use of technology it streamlines school administration, delivers lessons plan to teachers, facilitates classroom management and tracks the progress of both teachers and students in real time. It has notable investor support from Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. History Bridge International Academies was founded by friends Shannon May, Jay Kimmelman and Phil Frei, who met at a 5 year reunion Harvard University to solve for some of the most intractable problems in education and development, including: underprepared teachers, rampant teacher absenteeism, ill-equipped classrooms, and fraudulent administrative practices. In 2007, Bridge‚Äôs headquarters opened in Nairobi, Kenya in 2008. The first academy launched in 2009 in Mukuru kwa Njenga, an east-Nairobi slum that is home to over 100,000 people. From 2009 to 2015, Bridge expanded across Kenya, bringing its innovative approach to education to thousands more children every year. In 2015, Bridge continued growth in Kenya and expanded internationally, into Uganda and Nigeria. Bridge opened a London, UK office and was awarded one of six World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) Awards for innovation in education. In 2016, Bridge opened six schools in Andhra Pradesh, India in a partnership with the Government of Andhra Pradesh to use disused school buildings to create Bridge schools. Bridge was also chosen as one of the first partners by the Liberian Ministry for Education‚Äôs Partnership School for Liberia (PSL) program. The programme is a public-private partnership. The programme was re-named the Liberian Education Advancement Programme (LEAP) and is now in its fourth year and has now expanded across the country. The programme was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial. https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181478 https://www.cgdev.org/publication/beyond-short-term-learning-gains-impact- outsourcing-schools-liberia-after-three-years Bridge won the Global Shared Value award for an ‚Äúoutstanding record in re-conceiving education for a new market‚Äù in Kenya over 2016. Costs for bridge schools net losses and revenues are estimated and are not released by the firm, with losses in 2016 estimated $12m a year and with a total revenue of $16m / year. In 2017, the number of Bridge academies in Lagos, Nigeria increased. Bridge Liberia expanded to south-east Liberia. The internal M&E; report revealed learning gains for Liberian pupils, after four months. The RCT evaluation of the first year of PSL showed learning gains in Bridge-PSL schools, but while most providers in the public-private partnership kept students in oversubscribed schools and retained existing teachers, Bridge did not. Bridge removed pupils after taking control of schools with large class sizes, and removed 74% of incumbent teachers from their schools.https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181478 The third year of KCPE results were published with Bridge pupils outperforming their peers by 10 percentage points. Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki addresses a crowd of 7,000 graduating government qualified teachers at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City for launch of the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) initiative on October 10, 2018. In 2018, Bridge pupils took part in Ugandan primary school exams for the first time and 100% of Bridge pupils passed. Bridge was selected as a technical delivery partner for the Nigerian education initiative EdoBEST that aims to transform education in Edo State. Partnership Schools for Liberia was renamed Liberian Education Advancement Program (LEAP). In 2020, for the third year, pupils who sat the Ugandan Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) outperformed the nationwide average. =Approach= Bridge's approach uses a central team in each country to prepare content and monitor student progress. Bridge equips its teachers with a tablet onto which they download daily lesson plans and teacher guides up to two weeks in advance. The teachers guides set out the content and structure for each lesson. A typical lesson consists of three parts: # A teacher demonstrates a concept or solves an equation; # Next, the teacher guides students through the solving of a similar problem; for the majority of the lessons, students then work independently, applying and practicing what they‚Äôve learned; and, # The teacher then circulates around the classroom checking for understanding, assigning new questions for excelling children, and giving individual attention to struggling children. = Co-curricular activities = In addition to classroom lessons, the Bridge curriculum also includes extra-curricular activities such as sports, art, martial arts, music, and debate. =Structure= Bridge is managed through a centralised system in each country, lowering the administrative costs for operating individual schools. Each Bridge school has only one administrative staff member, known as an Academy Manager, headteacher or Principal, who manages the school through a smartphone loaded with a custom-developed application that connects managers to a central cloud-based server. Using the custom application, Bridge can track student admissions and billing - in community schools - in real-time and serves as a financial management tool for the overall academy, including fee payments, expense management, and payroll. The rate of teacher absenteeism for Bridge schools is documented at less than 1%, whereas in Kenyan public schools according to World Bank research, absenteeism in the classroom is 47.3%. =Monitoring and evaluation= Bridge uses technology and roving quality assurance teams to track learning outcomes. The teacher guides monitor attendance, timing of lesson delivery, and pupil comprehension, which is uploaded daily onto the central server. The central academic team can then review outcomes to iterate lessons in real time, or identify needs for further teacher training. The academic team additionally identifies new methods or resources they believe can aid learning and gathers data on results. Bridge uses this data on learning to not only improve its model, but also to contribute to wider pedagogy. =Learning gains= Observational evidence suggests that the longer pupils had been in a Bridge academy, the better they perform in their Kenyan KCPE exams: * 5+ years at Bridge: Average Score of 293 and Pass Rate of 74.4% * 4+ years at Bridge: Average Score of 286 and Pass Rate of 74% * 3+ years at Bridge: Average Score of 274 and Pass Rate of 66.4% * 2+ years at Bridge: Average Score of 261 and Pass Rate of 58.3% In July 2017, an internal M&E; report, revealed learning gains achieved at Bridge Partnership Schools for Liberia (PSL) in just four months. The report reveals that in four months, students in Bridge PSL public schools could: * Read 7 more words a minute and answer 6% more questions correctly about the story they just read; * In maths, they solved 2.6 more addition problems & 2.2 more subtraction problems in a minute; * 17% of Bridge PSL public school second graders met reading fluency benchmark for the first time, compared to only 4% of second graders at traditional public schools; * 15% of Bridge PSL public schools students met reading comprehension benchmarks for the first time, compared to 4% of students at traditional public schools; * In reading, Bridge PSL public school students outperformed traditional public school students in reading by 0.77 standard deviations; and, * In maths Bridge PSL public school students outperformed traditional public school students by 0.18 standard deviations: that‚Äôs 50% more learning in 4 months. Bridge PSL public school students made more progress toward achieving national literacy benchmarks. =Other outcomes= In Liberia, the experimental evaluation of the PSL program reveals that Bridge has a positive effect on students' learning. However, Bridge has a negative effect on pupil-level enrollment. In the first year this was due to mass un-enrollment of students in schools where enrollment was high and class sizes were large before Bridge arrived. After three years, students originally enrolled in partnership schools managed by Bridge were less likely to be enrolled in any school at all.https://www.cgdev.org/publication/beyond-short-term-learning-gains-impact- outsourcing-schools-liberia-after-three-years Awards and acclaim Bridge, as well as its founders, have received notable recognition through the winning of business awards and inclusion in internationally recognised reports and case studies.

In 2018, he was awarded an ACQ5 Gamechanger of the Year Award (Education; Africa). Criticism Organisation has received criticism from different sources, including teaching unions and education rights groups. Education groups have pushed back on Bridge as using a model that stifles creativity, innovation, and goes against educational research in developed countries. Critics have been accused of putting 'ideology before education'. After a statement by the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, in 2015, praising Bridge Schools, there was a large push-back from organisations in Kenya and Uganda, disagreeing with his statement, expressed deep concern over the global financial institution‚Äôs investment in a chain of private primary schools targeting poor families in Kenya and Uganda and called on the institution to support free universal education instead. Other have argued that their model, focused on guided instruction, actually allows for enhanced freedom similar to the way musicians use sheet music or actors have scripts. The company has come under criticism from aid agencies and civil rights groups, including ActionAid and Education for All, for being detrimental to the plan of offering a ‚Äúuniversal, free and compulsory basic education‚Äù to all children. Education International (EI), a global group of teachers‚Äô unions, has criticised Bridge for its for-profit model being ‚Äúmorally wrong.‚Äù Global Justice Now has criticized Bridge International Academies by suggesting that ‚Äúthe cost per student at just $6 dollars a month‚Äù is misleading. It states that 'the suggestion that $6 is an acceptable amount of money for poor households to pay reveals a profound lack of understanding of the reality of the lives of the poorest‚Äù. Global Justice Now calculated that for half their populations, the $6 per month per child it would cost to send http://globalinitiative-escr.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-2015-Join- statement-reaction-to-WB-statement-on-Bridge-14.05.2015.pdf three primary school age children to a Bridge Academy, is equal to at least a quarter of their monthly income. Many families already struggle to provide three meals a day to their children. It has also claimed that the real total cost of sending one child to a Bridge school is between $9 and $13 a month, and up to $20 when including school meals.

Also known as Catalpa Plantation, it includes Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The listing included five contributing buildings and one contributing site on . This home was the 1991 Winner of the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation's Honor Award. The Goodwyn homeplace is one of the few remaining examples of the antebellum plantation houses that were once numerous in Coweta County. Time, neglect, fire, and ill-directed remodeling have taken a heavy toll on Coweta's early homes. The Goodwyn home was built by a Virginia family of substantial means. Many families from Virginia came to Coweta in the 1830s and 1840s and settled near each other in the eastern districts. The Goodwyns included Anne Dance Goodwyn, widow of Burwell Goodwyn of Brunswick County, Virginia and her children, Thomas, Ann Eliza, Napoleon, Sarah, James, and Henry (and possibly others). The family settled in the Poplar Road area and remained there until after the turn of the century. The administrator of Burwell Goodwyn's estate petitioned that Goodwyn \\"left real and personal property worth some considerable sum...\\" The quality of the home Thomas constructed after their arrival is testimony to the family's wealth. Few homes were built in Coweta in the 1840s (less than twenty years after the lottery opening the territory) of the size and detail found in the Goodwyn home. The homeplace remained in the family until 1900. It continued to be a well-kept home, but sadly, not well-preserved. Numerous architectural changes and some structural ones ere made to the house over the years. Finally an absentee owner assured that the property would fall into disrepair through thirty years of tenants and vandalism. As the house stood vacant in the mid-1980s, many felt that the property was beyond saving. In 1986, the property was purchased by Rod Smith. Mr. Smith immediately began extensive research on the home and the family. The house retained its original mantels, panelled wainscot, double panelled doors, plaster, floors, fluted square Doric columns, chimneys, and basic floor plan. An exhaustive study of the home revealed that numerous changes had been made to the original structure over the years. These included the removal of the old stairway rising from the rear of the stair hall, it being replaced by an early 20th century stair facing the front of the hallway. A full one-story front porch was added incorporating the original columns. Second floor rear windows were closed off and another upstairs room was added. The original cookhouse was removed and a new kitchen was added. The Smiths began their restoration by removing the additions to the house as well as those portions of the home which had deteriorated beyond repair. As work progressed, the original location of moved doors, windows, and staircase became evident. In many areas, decorative trim had been moved intact or reused in other areas of the home. Removal of the 20th century staircase exposed the original outline of the early stair. The Smiths have recreated the stair with old materials where possible, including a newel post from a demolished Coweta home of the same era. The doorway to the west parlor was returned to its original position under the restored stair. Double French doors had been added to the east parlor, which were removed and the original door trim found in another part of the home (matching the room's window trim) was placed back in position. The single panelled double doors from the front of the home were found on a closet in the house (having been replaced by a more \\"modern\\" doorway at some point) Matching doors were made by Herbert Gordy, Coweta's master carpenter (brother of D.X. Gordy, the renowned potter) for the rear of the stair hall. Mr. Gordy reproduced the bases for the massive columns from an early photograph and all other detail work needed for the restoration. The full-width front porch was of concrete, removed by Mr. Smith with a jackhammer. The balcony was replaced using the early photograph as a guide. Mr. Smith, his wife, and his father carefully repaired, replaced where needed, and skim-coated all of the plaster walls and ceilings in the home. The floor of the dining room was replaced with period flooring and the work on the dining room turned up evidence of the back staircase to the basement \\"summer kitchen\\" and to the second floor rear bedroom. This staircase was restored to its original configuration with meticulous attention given to blend new materials with old. The job is so skillfully done that there is no evidence that the stair had not remained untouched for a century and a half. The brick floor to the lower level room and the missing mantel were replaced. Two windows which had been changed were replaced with copies of the one intact window in the room. The \\"new\\" kitchen was removed and a wing added to the house to accommodate the Smith's kitchen and sitting room. Every effort was made to keep the flavor of the early home in the new construction and the result is remarkably successful blend of a functional family area incorporated into the restoration. The Smiths had acquired several outbuildings of the period and plan their restoration. The home has been opened to school children of the county as a part of the Heritage Education Program sponsored by the Coweta County School System.Flyer available at Catalpa Plantation, researched and written by Georgia Shapiro - Newnan, GA, 1991 References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Greek Revival houses in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Houses completed in 1835 Category:Houses in Coweta County, Georgia Category:Plantation houses in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coweta County, Georgia ","title":"Goodwyn-Bailey House"},{"id":"36722246","text":"Tom Urie (born 1969, Paisley, Scotland, UK) is an actor and musician.

After the publication in 1976 of his work A Day in February in the magazine Novy Mir, Soviet editors refused to publish his works until 1988, when he was able to publish a collection of prose. His novel Lines of Fate, written between 1981 and 1985, brought him international recognition upon its publication in 1992. The novel was awarded the first Russian Booker Prize that year. In the novel, the narrator, a literary historian named Anton Lizavin, attempts to piece together the details of the life of a fictional Soviet writer and philosopher named Semyon Milasevich, whose works have been forgotten and neglected. He does this by examining Milasevich's writings, done on candy wrappers, the only paper available to him after the Russian Revolution of 1917, and through various archival research. Kharitonov's works, like those of Vladimir Makanin, Viktor Pelevin and others, use a combination of realism and postmodernism. According to critic Neil Cornwell, Lines of Fate shows the influence of Thomas Mann and Hermann Hesse. Lines of Fate won the Russian Booker Prize by beating out the contributions of much better known authors like Vladimir Makanin and Lyudmila Petrushevskaya. His winning of the prize made him a recognized writer, making it easier to publish more of his works, including those he had written prior to Lines of Fate. He published a modernist novel Return from Nowhere in 1995. He is married to Galina Edelman with one son and two daughters. English translations *Lines of Fate: A Novel, New Press, 1997.

Kim Gavin (who also directed the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics) served as director for the ceremony, while Stephen Daldry served as its executive producer. The ceremony was themed around festivals and the four seasons, and was set to music performed live by the British rock group Coldplay, also joined by special guest performers such as the British Paraorchestra, Rihanna and Jay-Z. In a formal handover ceremony, the Paralympic flag was passed from Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city of the 2016 Summer Paralympics. During his closing speech, International Paralympic Committee president Philip Craven congratulated London for hosting \\"the greatest Paralympic Games ever.\\" Following the official closure of the Games, the Paralympic cauldron was extinguished by swimmer Eleanor Simmonds and sprinter Jonnie Peacock. Production Kim Gavin, who also directed the closing ceremony of the Summer Olympics just a few weeks prior, would serve as the director for the ceremony. The ceremony's overlying theme was the gathering of people in celebration, honouring the many seasonal festivals that have been held throughout Great Britain's history. Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin was enthusiastic about his band's prominent role in the closing ceremony, and promised that their act would \\"close London 2012 in style.\\" Both Gavin and executive producer Stephen Daldry contended that the closing ceremony would not just simply be a Coldplay concert, promising \\"fantastic visuals and amazing stunts\\" throughout. Charles Hazlewood's British Paraorchestra (a 17-piece orchestra of musicians with disabilitiesthe first of its kind in the United Kingdom), made appearances during the closing ceremony; performing alongside Coldplay and also performing the Paralympic anthem. Hazlewood campaigned for the Paraorchestra to be included in the ceremonies of the Paralympics, as he felt that their inclusion could help spread international awareness for disabled musicians. Performance synopsis =Pre-show= The Dreamers' whimsical musical vehicles In order for all the athletes to enjoy the show in its entirety, all athletes entered the stadium together before the start of the ceremony to take their seats. A group of silver-coloured \\"dreamers\\" then took to the field on a set of pedal powered vehicles that doubled up as musical instruments. Some of the dreamers kept falling asleep, but they eventually managed to inflate three crescent moons which were lifted from the ground and suspended, forming the Agitos. None of the pre-show was broadcast on television. The Dreamers remained on the field, asleep until the official start of the Closing Ceremony. =Windstorm= The closing ceremony opened with a film called \\"The Book of Fire\\" by director Mike Christie showing \\"eccentric travellers\\" from around the city making their way to the Olympic Stadium in steampunk-inspired vehicles prepared by the performance art group Mutoid Waste Company. At the end of the film, a group of Wind Gremlins drove into the stadium on custom- built motorbikes with huge fans on the front. The wind awakened the Dreamers from their sleep, and they struggled to fend off the Gremlins' attack while keeping the Agitos in place. In the end the Dreamers were unable to hold on, and the Agitos float away with one of the Dreamers still clinging on to them. At that point, performers carrying flares entered the field of play to the rescue of the Dreamers. =Raising of the Flag= A horse-like vehicle entered and was followed by the Human Endeavour machine pulled by a team from Help for Heroes. When the team reached the sundial stage a flagpole was erected with the combined effort of the men from the team. Captain Luke Sinnott (who lost both of his legs and an arm in an explosion on-duty in Helmand, Afghanistan, and aimed to compete in sailing at the 2016 Summer Paralympics) proceeded to climb the pole (representing human endeavour) to fly the Union Flag. At the same time 54 drummers carrying flaming poles on their backs marched onto the field to form the Agitos. Just as Captain Sinnott reached the top of the flag pole, Prince Edward and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Sir Philip Craven were driven through the Agitos on the field in an art car built from the body of a military vehicle and a 1930s automobile. Blind and autistic singer Lissa Hermans performed the British national anthem \\"God Save the Queen\\" (which she also performed as a charity single for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II). =The Heart of Many Nations= Flags of the nations in a heart shape. After climbing the steps to the top of the sundial stage in the centre, the Reader, played by Lance Corporal Rory MacKenzie, addressed the stadium with a speech introducing the theme of the ceremony's cultural presentation, \\"The Festival of the Flame\\". His speech was followed by the entrance of the flags of participating nations. At the end of the procession, the flagbearers were in formation in the shape of a heart, and pyrotechnics outlined their shape on the field. =Truck Invasion= The Reader then read a text taken from a modern druidic ritual written by members of the British Druid Order,British Druid Order website, 9 September 2012. BDO Druidry Goes Global in the Paralympics Closing Ceremony calling upon the spirits of the four seasons. After he announced the commencement of the festival, a squad armed with backpack flamethrowers walked onto the field burning patterns similar to crop circles into the grass. At the same time the trucks and travellers previously seen in the opening film entered the stadium, forming a procession consisting of ships, a Clocks truck, creatures like a fish and a grasshopper, and crows on stilts. The truck invasion ended with all trucks and performers assembled around the central sundial stage. =Spirit of the Games= This section began with the awarding of the Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award to Mary Nakhumicha Zakayo of Kenya and Michael McKillop of Ireland. Zakayo competed in discus, javelin and shot put T57-58. McKillop won gold medals in the 800m T37 and 1500m T37. After this, the six newly elected members of the IPC Athlete's Council; Arnaud Assoumani (Athletics, France), Gizem Girismen, (Para‚ÄìArchery, Turkey), Jon McCullough (7‚Äìa‚Äìside Football, United States of America), Teresa Perales (Swimming, Spain), Elvira Stinissen (Sitting Volleyball, Netherlands), Yu Chui Yee (Wheelchair Fencing, Hong Kong) were introduced to the stadium. These six represented all athletes and the IPC in thanking the volunteers of the London 2012 Paralympic Games by presenting flowers to volunteer representatives. =The Festival of the Flame= The Festival of the Flame kicked off properly as a live concert by Coldplay followed. Coldplay performed from the sundial stage, and performances were broadly categorised into the four seasons, beginning with Autumn and finishing with Summer. Autumn The Sun God rises in the stadium. Coldplay began the set with \\"Us Against The World\\", as performers crowded around the stage signed the lyrics to the song. They then followed it with \\"Yellow\\", one of the band's first singles, while dancers from the Candoco Dance Company danced on the North Stage and a flaming mask of the Sun King rose from it, signifying the end of the harvest season. Coldplay next sang \\"Up in Flames\\", with aerial artistes Lyndsay Care (who has cerebral palsy) and Denis Remnev performing a strap act on the Clocks truck. The band closed the Autumn segment with \\"Paradise\\"; 19 aerialists attached to lightbulbs floated from the top down to the field, symbolising fireflies which mark the end of Autumn. Winter The short Winter segment was soundtracked by Coldplay's \\"42\\". 6 warrior skaters holding flaming torches skated around the Snow Queen (played by Viktoria Modesta Moskalova) on the South Stage, frozen in her cage. Slowly the skaters melted the \\"ice\\" and removed the bars on her cage, releasing the Queen. The Snow Queen was inspired by the White Queen from C. S. Lewis' popular series The Chronicles of Narnia. Green lights then filled the stadium, replacing the chilly blue of Winter and signalling the impending arrival of Spring. Coldplay performed \\"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\\" with guest drummer Mat Fraser, who was born with phocomelia of both arms. Spring Spring opened with a performance of \\"Clocks\\" featuring a laser show and poi jugglers from Feeding the Fish performing with their unique Pixel-Poi light batons which projected images whilst spinning through the air. The stadium lit up with Xylobands, special LED wristbands given to all athletes in the field of play which lit up in time to the music. These were the same type of wristbands given to audience members of Coldplay's Mylo Xyloto Tour. During the next song \\"Charlie Brown\\", 120 children carrying 600 car hub caps ran towards the Fish truck in the field of play and hung the caps, painted to represent fish scales, on the fish skeleton. Rihanna arrived on the Ship truck to perform \\"Princess of China\\", her collaboration with Coldplay. Summer Coldplay frontman Chris Martin introduced the British Paraorchestra who performed a short instrumental intro leading into \\"Strawberry Swing\\", while dancers behind the orchestra danced their way into the Summer segment. After that song, Rihanna made her second appearance, singing \\"We Found Love\\" whilst suspended on a metal bench over the dancers and performers rode carousel horses suspended in the air. Coldplay concluded this segment of the ceremony with a performance of \\"Viva la Vida\\". The Summer dancers and Candoco Dance Company danced on the two stages as other performers joined in the revelry. The main concert segment finished with Chris Martin leading the stadium in a big sing- along from the top of the sundial. =Al√¥ Rio= The Paralympic flag was formally lowered by three members of the Ministry of Defence, while the British Paraorchestra performed the Paralympic anthem. The flag was then passed from the hands of the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to that of IPC president Philip Craven, who in turn formally handed the flag to Eduardo Paes, mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the next host city in 2016. =Joy= The handover was followed by a cultural presentation by Rio entitled \\"Joy\\". Set to music performed by Thalma De Freitas, Paralamas do Sucesso and Carlinhos Brown, it featured disabled and able-bodied dancers competing in dance battles that incorporated a combination of hip-hop with traditional Brazilian dances. The presentation ended with fireworks. =The Final Flame= The presentation was followed by speeches from LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe and Sir Philip Craven. Coe stated that we had our minds opened to what people can do and achieve by sheer talent and determination. Coe paid tribute to the volunteers of the games by recalling two stories of people he had met. The first was during a journey on the tube where he met Andrew, a Games Maker, which Coe branded among the heroes of London 2012, who is a doctor at St Mary's hospital whilst on his way to helping out at the boxing. When Coe tried to thank him for all his help, Andrew said that it is Coe who should be thanked. Andrew suddenly said that he had was on duty during the London bombings for him this is closure. Andrew wasn't sure that he should come but was glad he did, as he had seen the worst of mankind and now he had seen the best of mankind. A few days later Coe met Emily at the Paralympic Games, who said that it has lifted the cloud of limitation. Coe then stated to Andrew and Emily that he was going to have the last word and thanked them and all the volunteers, which drew a standing ovation from the crowd. Continuing Coe stated that the games led the public to not think about sport or disability the same way again, and agreeing with Emily that the cloud has been lifted. Coe felt that London's high quality organisation of the Olympics and Paralympics were worthy enough of being labelled \\"Made in Britain.\\" Craven hailed the Games as simply amazing. Continuing Craven noted that the Beijing Closing Ceremony theme was a Letter to the Future which was received with open arms by Coe and his team committed to delivering a successful games in London; stating that the team were determined to satisfy the British public's insatiable appetite for elite sport. Craven continuing stated that the Olympic Delivery Authority and LOCOG have helped inspired a generation; adding that this were not just London's Games, but thanks to LOCOG's Charles Alan's group, they were the Games of the United Kingdom and noted that the country had a feel good factor like never before. Craven stated that there were numerous of examples of teams working together and noted that those with irrepressible smiles and a fountain of knowledge is whom the biggest cheer should be reserved for, stating \\"has already happened and will happen again\\", the thousands of Games Makers. Craven went on to hail the International and national technical officials, classifiers and particularly the armed forces and emergency services who had stepped into the breach. Paralympians were noted by Craven for giving to the world many feats that people thought impossible, causing the media to be wax lyrical, and leading many spectators to create what Boris Johnson described as a wall of noise. Craven stated that the Games had truly come home and had found a path for the future. Craven congratulated London for staging what were \\"unique and without doubt, in my mind and those of the athletes, the greatest Paralympic Games ever.\\" Craven concluded by linking Stephen Hawking's words about changing perceptions across multiple dimensions from the opening ceremony to George Glenn, a five-year-old, who was asked a question by his mother, Emma, when reading a book called Treasure. Emma asked who that man was on the first page, who was dressed as a pirate. George's reply was \\"well he only has one leg ‚Äì so he must be an athlete.\\" Craven stated that kids just get it now we all do thanks to the amazing performance witnessed here. Craven closed the 2012 Paralympic Games and stated that these Paralympic Games will live for an eternity and called on all Paralympic athletes around the world to meet again in four years in Rio. Craven ended with a big, big thank you for the people of London and the United Kingdom. Following Sir Philip's speech, the Paralympics cauldron was extinguished, save for one petal. British Paralympians Eleanor Simmonds and Jonnie Peacock lit their torches with this last flame, and they in turn passed the flame on to performers who spread out onto the field of play, representing an eternal flame reaching all people. Coldplay and Rihanna returned to the stage with rapper Jay-Z to perform his collaboration \\"Run This Town\\", followed by a reprise of \\"Paradise\\" with new rap verses from Jay-Z. =Finale= This was then followed by a performance by Coldplay of \\"The Scientist\\" set to a video montage of highlights from the Games. Coldplay closed the ceremony with a performance of \\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\\", while fountains on the stages sprayed and performers danced in the \\"rain\\". The final song was followed by a fireworks display over the Olympic Stadium and the Thames River, accompanied by an orchestral and choral arrangement of Coldplay's Politik, during which Tower Bridge was raised. The display ended with the Union Flag being projected on the Palace of Westminster, which faded to black, revealing a message reading \\"Thank you London, Thank you UK.\\" Stadium announcers Trish Bertram and Marc Edwards closed the ceremony with a farewell message ‚Äì To athletes of the world to the people of London and the United Kingdom, the volunteers and the staff of the London 2012 Organising Committee, thank you for an unforgettable summer, thank you for inspiring a generation. Good night and goodbye. Reception An estimated number of 7.7 million people watched the closing ceremony on Channel 4. Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph characterized the closing ceremony as a more \\"thematic, pagan-style show\\" than the intellectual opening ceremony, and described its opening scene as \\"a fire-filled opener filled with cannibalised machines that looked like a cross between War Horse and Scrapheap Challenge.\\" Whilst acknowledging that Coldplay may not be considered the best example of British music by all viewers, McNulty praised the band for \\"[knowing] how to play to a stadium and fill it with emotionally, uplifting anthems\\" and for not performing their \\"potentially patronizing 'Fix You'.\\" McNulty concluded by proclaiming that \\"the most successful Paralympics ever thankfully got the rousing closing ceremony that it deserved.\\" The Guardian's Alexis Petridis noted that portions of the closing ceremony had a noticeably darker feel than the other ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics in London, but complimented it for having \\"[a] whiff of the kind of thing you see at 3am in the outlying fields at Glastonbury\\", unlike the Olympics' closing ceremony, which had \\"a whiff of a bad night at the Brits.\\" Although he considered some of Coldplay's slower, anthem-like songs to be in conflict with his belief that the Paralympics were not about \\"pity\\" (which he associated the songs with through their use on reality TV shows), Petridis praised Coldplay's more upbeat performances, such as their performance of \\"Strawberry Swing\\" alongside the Paraorchestra, and concluded that the performance of \\"Run This Town\\" was \\"weirdly appropriate\\" when viewed in the context of the Games.

Jimmy was interested in working with JR Castro from I-15 for one of his artist songs. They officially met up a week later at Odds On Recording Studios in Henderson. After vibing at the studio in an all night session, they realized each other talents and began to create together. They coined their name ‚ÄúThe Audibles‚Äù from its root definition ‚Äúto be heard‚Äù and ‚Äúto change the game‚Äù as seen by quarterbacks in football. JR Castro and Das offered an opportunity for the two to move to Atlanta and develop their art further under producer Polow Da Don. Career =Before Las Vegas= Through working with Polow in 2008, The Audibles went on to co- write and produce songs on I-15's album that was never released. =Rise to success= Their first major production hit came with Interscope recording artist Mishon‚Äôs ‚ÄúTurn it Up‚Äù in 2009.

The space \\\\bar{K} will be finite if all relative homotopy groups are finitely generated. Wall showed that this will be the case if and only if his finiteness obstruction vanishes. More precisely, using covering space theory and the Hurewicz theorem one can identify \\\\pi_n(r) with H_n(\\\\widetilde{X},\\\\widetilde{K}). Wall then showed that the cellular chain complex C_*(\\\\widetilde{X}) is chain-homotopy equivalent to a chain complex A_* of finite type of projective \\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\pi_1(X)]-modules, and that H_n(\\\\widetilde{X},\\\\widetilde{K})\\\\cong H_n(A_*) will be finitely generated if and only if these modules are stably-free. Stably-free modules vanish in reduced K-theory. This motivates the definition :w(X)=\\\\sum_i(-1)^i[A_i]\\\\in\\\\widetilde{K}_0(\\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\pi_1(X)]).

There is a similar sign at Delta Tech Ops that says \\"Fly Delta Jets\\" The original Delta Technical Operations Center Jet Base, later known as Technical Operations Center (TOC) 1, opened on June 21, 1960 at Atlanta Municipal Airport (eventually renamed to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport). This facility covered 9 acres, employed 1,600 individuals and provided service exclusively to Delta Air Lines‚Äô fleet of 79 aircraft, including 9 jets. In May 1968, Delta TechOps completed its first expansion, increasing the total space by 7 acres and adding another 1,700 employees, more than doubling the size of the division‚Äôs workforce. In 1973, Delta TechOps added another 20-acre hangar, known as TOC 2, increasing the total acreage to 36. By 1982, more additions were needed to accommodate the growing business, and TOC 1 was expanded by another 10 acres. Up until this point, Delta TechOps had only performed maintenance, repairs and overhauls on Delta Air Lines‚Äô own fleet, but in 1983, the division began offering these services to other airlines. Today, third party business accounts for 20-25% of the division‚Äôs workload. The most recent facility expansion, a four-story, 17-acre addition known as TOC 3, was completed in 1991, bringing the total size of the facilities at Hartsfield-Jackson to 63 acres. Delta TechOps generated revenues of more than $310M in 2006 and by 2009, this amount had reached the half-billion mark. In 2008, Delta TechOps received ISO 9001 certifications for its component maintenance shops. In 2009, Delta TechOps joined EPA's National Partnership for Environmental Priorities in committing to eliminate lead from machine shop operations and recycle 7,000 pounds of lead. In 2011, Delta TechOps expanded its partnership with Skymark Airlines to provide advance exchange power-by-the-hour services for 25 CFM56-7B powered Boeing 737NG aircraft. Delta TechOps received ISO 9001 certification from the International Standards Organization for its engine maintenance and landing gear shops and is one of only a few airline maintenance, repair and overhaul service providers to achieve the certification. Delta TechOps invested in new MRO technology for engines to cut costs and boost revenue during 2012. In 2013, Delta TechOps and EmpowerMX signed an agreement to employ the cloud- based FleetCycle¬Æ MRO Manager product as the primary maintenance-execution tool in all of Delta TechOps airframe MRO facilities. In 2014, Delta TechOps expanded its maintenance providership with Hawaiian Airlines with an integrated component exchange and repair program for 12 Boeing 767 aircraft.

He worked in several genres of art including German Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism, Color fielding, and Figuration. He is known for his international solo and group exhibitions primarily presented in the US, France, Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. He maintained studios in Emeryville, California and in Uerikon near Lake Zurich for over 30 years.  Personal background  Kurt O. Weber was born on 26 July 1938 in Zurich, Switzerland. Weber traveled internationally throughout his life. In 1968, he traveled to the US and with his wife, artist Colette Leitner, (AKA Lindner) began a 13-year adventure exploring the country. In 1970, he became a US citizen, while simultaneously maintaining his Swiss citizenship. During this period, he continued his artwork, which primarily included sketching and drafting ideas. Following their exploration across the US, which ended in 1981, Weber divorced and moved to the western US. Arriving in California, Weber set up a studio in Emeryville, located in the San Francisco Bay area. It was here that he created his first large-format images. Later on, he would commute back and forth between America and Europe, which continued until the 1990s when he temporarily took up residence in Basel. Following the separation from his second wife, he switched his primary residence back to San Francisco. While maintaining a studio in California, he continued to travel to Paris and Switzerland on a regular basis. It wasn't until 2009, that Weber exhibited his art in his native city of Zurich for the first time. In Paris, during the growing environment of the existentialism, Weber met Jean-Paul Sartre and Alberto Giacometti. He formed a lifelong friendship with the Giacometti, who advised him to develop and maintain ownership and independence of his artistic style and expression, apart from the influence and control of the artistic community that would seek to define his work based on the desires and artistic direction of others. To that end, Weber continued to develop new techniques and painting processes, which included the use of mixed media, pigments, and bright, vibrant colors on various canvasses and placement boards. In 1964, with the encouragement of Giacometti, Weber traveled to New York, where the avant garde movement had been developing and coming to prominence on a global scale. While intrigued by the creative expression of the abstract painters he encountered in New York, he was drawn to the historic monuments of the Mayas and the Aztecs and began traveling to Mexico regularly. It was this combination of experiences - the breadth and spatiality of American abstract painting and Mexico's luminous colors that moved Weber to a radical new start.  Educational background  Weber's professional training was varied and included studying with world- renowned artists throughout Europe. He attended the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Arts) in Vienna, Switzerland, from 1955 through 1958. The school was a highly progressive school that offered an education that focused primarily on architecture, furniture, crafts, and modern design. While Vienna's Academy of Fine Art was considered more prestigious and traditional, the education at Kunstgewerbeschule was dominated by instructors of the Vienna Secession. Following the completion of his education at Kunstgewerbeschule, Weber relocated to Paris, where he studied sculpture and painting under the guidance of Andr√© Lh√¥te, founder of the Acad√©mie d'Art in Montparnasse. Afterwards, Weber went to Italy to study the famous murals and wall paintings created by Italian Renaissance painters. After completing initial studies of the Italian frescoes, Weber moved to Salzburg, Austria, where he studied with Oskar Kokoschka, founder of the Schule des Sehens (School of Seeing). He additionally studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Zurich and the Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) in Paris. He and studied lithography and etching with Stanley Hayter in Paris.  Influences  Andr√© L‚ÄôH√¥te was not only a professor but also a significant influence on Weber's early emerging talent. Fernand L√©ger, also contributed to Weber in his early years. As Weber's work matured the classic influences of Andrea Montegna, Caravaggio, Pierro Della Francesca, and Fra Angelica are evident. He received the greatest inspiration in his professional career from Alberto Giacometti and Pablo Picasso.  Personal style  Weber's oeuvre consists of four distinct genres: Late German Expressionism, which reveals his close scrutiny of Max Beckmann, E. L. Kirchner, and Emile Nolde. Abstract Expressionist works salute Jackson Pollock, Conrad Marca-Relli, Arshille Gorky, and Philip Guston. Figuration nods to Eric Fischl and Egon Schiele. Weber's expansive Colorfields reflect his respect for fellow Bay Area artist, Richard Diebenkorn, as well as Helen Frankenthaler, Ad Reinhardt, and Barnett Newman.  Death  Weber died in Basel, Switzerland on 29 October 2011. At the time of his death, he had perfected a previously undeveloped painting technique and process which allowed brilliant inks and pigment to adhere to translucent vellum. His last collective series encompassed the perfecting of this technique, which he referred to as Clusters. Following his death, an exhibition of a retrospective collection of Weber's life and work from 1960 through 2009 was presented at the Sammlung Gallerie S/Z in Zurich, running from June through August 2012.

In addition to being secure digital signatures, they need to allow for the efficient implementation of two protocols: # A protocol for computing a digital signature in a secure two- party computation protocol. # A protocol for proving knowledge of a digital signature in a zero-knowledge protocol. In applications the first protocol allows a signer in possession of the signing key, to issue a signature to a user (the signature owner) without learning all the messages being signed or the complete signature. The second protocol allows the signature owner to prove that he has a signature on a number of messages, without revealing the signature and only a (possibly) empty subset of the messages. The combination of these two protocols allows for the implementation of digital credential and ecash protocols.

History King Otto of Greece was one of the most famous visitors, he even had the water brought to Athens The local springs had been discovered hundreds of years ago; the first written account dates back to 1522. In the 17th century the counts of ƒåern√≠n permitted their subjects to drink the Kyselka mineral water for free. The springs were first used for spa purposes in 1792 when the location was already widely known. The first spa buildings were built in the years 1826-1832 by Wilhelm von Neuberg. The fame of the spa and the tasty water was growing; in 1852 Otto of Greece visited the place and the main spring was named after him. In the course of time the spring had several owners; one of them, count Johann Joseph von Stiebar auf Buttenheim, came up with the idea to export the mineral water (1824) and established a small factory for the production of clay jugs in which the water was bottled. The local water was then sold in Vienna, Prague and also in Carlsbad. =Mattoni's era= In 1867 the main spring was rented by the Czech businessman of Italian-German origin Heinrich K. Mattoni who began to bottle the water in glass bottles and export it worldwide. In 1873 he had enough money to buy the spa and the surrounding land. Before he died in 1910, he managed to build a new colonnade which roofed the famous ‚ÄúOtta‚Äôs spring‚Äù as well as the buildings of the sanatorium, the hydropathic institute, hotels, restaurants, promenades, the cableway, the chapel of Saint Anna (1884), his monumental residence (‚ÄúThe Chateau‚Äù), a hydroelectric power station and the buildings of the bottling plant. Finally he brought railway here so that quietness of the spa was not disturbed by wagons carting mineral water. During his epoch the spa flourished and it has not reached such prosperity ever since. Mattoni‚Äôs descendants nevertheless kept this property until the end of World War II. =In the hands of the state= After the war, the buildings shortly served as a refugee camp for orphans from the Greek Civil War and after that as a sanatorium for children. It was closed down after the fall of the Communist regime in 1989. During this period, the premises deteriorated to some degree but were at least somehow maintained. The current situation Deteriorating spa buildings ‚Äì August 2010 (the house with a spire belongs to KMV a.s. and is still in use) Since the chaotic voucher privatization between 1991 and 1993, the spa has had several owners. None of them was able or willing to save the spa or at least partially prevent it from dilapidation. Today (2012) the buildings are partially inaccessible, the water springs in rubble heaps of the buildings and leaks into the foundations. Many of the buildings are doomed to demolition. The whole site is moreover burdened with freight (few hundred trucks a day), as the railway was closed down. The current proprietors are the company C.T.S. ‚Äì DUO and the Carlsbad Mineral Waters owned by the Italian tycoon A. Pasquale who owns the bottling plant and the Mattoni brand as well. The owners have repeatedly promised to renovate the complex, but it becomes obvious that they are counting on the buildings being torn down. All this in spite of the opinion of the Preservation of Monuments bureau, of the attitude of the representatives of the Karlovy Vary Region as well as a quite strong civil movement (over 28,000 signatures) led by the Association for the Protection and Development of the Cultural Heritage of the Czech Republic (ASORKD).Kyselka can still be saved, says the grandson of the former owner of the dilapidated spa References External links *Zachra≈àte l√°znƒõ Kyselka! ‚Äì petition initiated by ASORKD Category:Spas Category:Historic buildings and structures in the Czech Republic Category:Water ","title":"Kyselka Spa"},{"id":"36722520","text":"Khurian (, also Romanized as Kh≈´rƒ´ƒÅn and KhowryƒÅn; also known as Kharƒ´ƒÅn) is a village in Dehmolla Rural District, in the Central District of Shahrud County, Semnan Province, Iran.

Compatibility with data networks and routers While the connection on an Ethernet over copper cable is similar to that of a conventional Ethernet cable, the physical layers used for Ethernet over copper are different from the physical layers used for conventional Ethernet, so special adapters are required for Ethernet over copper; the Ethernet over copper connection cannot be plugged into a conventional Ethernet port on a switch, router, or computer. EoC is usually delivered as an \\"internet facing\\" service. EoC can also be delivered other ways. It can interface with private networking (i.e., an existing WAN, MPLS, or VPN network). Can also support SIP, PRI, analog, and hosted PBX voice services as well. Advantages and disadvantages =Advantages= As Ethernet over copper cabling is made up of twisted telephone wire, it is affordable. This consistency of Ethernet between the service provider core and the customer network reduces overhead, increasing performance & providing a more consistent connection to the user. =Disadvantages= As with DSL, distance is a factor.

Mill here refers to an industry which manufactures and processes raw materials. Steel An MTC provides traceability and assurance to the end user about the quality of the steel used and the process used to produce it. Typically a European MTC will be produced to EN 10204.BS EN 10204:2004 \\"Metallic Products ‚Äì Types of Inspection Documents\\" High quality steels for pressure vessel of structural purposes will be declared to 2.1 or 2.2 or certificated to 3.1 or 3.2. (EDIT: type is declared not by chapter in the document, but by type name, so edited the numbering) The MTC will specify the type of certificate, the grade of steel and any addenda. It will also specify the results of chemical and physical examination to allow the purchaser or end user to compare the plate to the requirements of the relevant standards. = What is MTC for steel? = In steel industry, MTC means mill's test certificate. Some mills also call it as MTR, that is, mill's test rep. One MTC must contain the following information: steel mill's name, heat number, batch number, final test result, steel pipe dimension (steel pipe diameter, wall thickness, length), quantity, steel grade, standard/specification, chemical analysis composition results, mechanical test properties results. If applicable, there also should be hydro test result, UT result, hardness test result, CVN impact results, metal graphic result etc. Usually mill will issue a table as the format of MTC of steel pipe or steel plate, to be filled with enough test results. Companies will issue a report format as MTC for steel pipes. There are mainly two types of MTC in steel industry, as for steel plates or steel pipes, there must be specific inspection scope or lists: # MTC EN 10204 3.1 :MTC 3.1 is issued by the manufacturer in which they declare that the products supplied are in compliance with the requirements of the order and in which they supply test results. This is the most common MTC in steel industry, when there is no extra requirement of customer for TPI inspection and witness of production and inspection of tests. # MTC EN 10204 3.2 :MTC 3.2 refers to the report prepared by both the manufacturer's authorized inspection representative, independent of the manufacturing department and either the purchaser's authorized inspection representative or the inspector designated by the official regulations and in which they declare that the products supplied are in compliance with the requirements of the order and in which test results are supplied.

Quelch joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), of which both his father, Harry, and his uncle, Lorenzo were members. The SDF formed the British Socialist Party (BSP), and Quelch came to attention in 1912 when he issued an appeal for soldiers to refuse to act as strikebreakers. This caused a Conservative MP, Oliver Locker-Lampson, to complain about him in the House of Commons.'Socialist Appeal to Soldiers: Advice to decline strike- duty', The Times, 8 March 1912, p.10; 'House of Commons', The Times, 12 March 1912. Quelch was involved in founding The Call in 1916, resisting attempts to turn the BSP into a Social Patriotic organisation at the outbreak of the First World War. However he was reluctant concerning the presence of African workers in the United Kingdom, raising concerns not merely that they might scab on strikes, but also that they might strike up sexual relationships with English women. He was one of 13 conveners of the Leeds convention to hail the Russian Revolution, held on 3 June 1917, and was appointed a member of the Central Committee of the Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Delegates at the event.What Happened at Leeds, report published by the Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Delegates, June 1917 Quelch was delegated with such as John S.

He previously pitched for the San Diego Padres, Boston Red Sox, and New York Yankees of Major League Baseball. Amateur career Layne attended Fort Zumwalt South High School in St. Peters, Missouri, where he played baseball and soccer. He then enrolled at Southwestern Illinois College where he played college baseball for two years. He then played at the University of Central Missouri for one year before transferring to Mount Olive College in Mount Olive, North Carolina, where he played for the Mount Olive Trojans. In 2007, Layne was named an All-American and Carolinas-Virginia Athletic Conference Baseball Pitcher of the Year. Professional career =Arizona Diamondbacks= The Arizona Diamondbacks drafted Layne in the 26th round of the 2007 MLB Draft. Layne progressed steadily up the minor league ladder over five seasons in the Diamondbacks' system and was promoted to the Triple-A Reno Aces in early 2011. Over three seasons, Layne had posted a 3.82 earned run average (ERA) working exclusively as a starter in Double-A for the Diamondbacks, but struggled in his time at Triple-A, accumulating a 6.21 ERA in 15 games started and 17 relief appearances in 2011. =San Diego Padres= The San Diego Padres acquired Layne from the Diamondbacks on May 3, 2012, for cash considerations. Layne made 5 starts and notched a 7.77 ERA for the Triple-A Tucson Padres before he was demoted to the Double-A San Antonio Missions and began working out of the bullpen. Layne was noted as having a \\"rubber arm\\" and he enjoyed having the chance to pitch every day, so he welcomed the transition to a reliever role. Layne had more success at Double-A, posting a 3.28 ERA and 36 strikeouts in 35 innings. The Padres promoted Layne to the major leagues on August 14. Layne made his Major League debut the same night against the Atlanta Braves, striking out the side in his one inning. Layne remained with the Padres for the rest of 2012, working out of the bullpen. He didn't allow a run in his first 11 appearances.

Albania ritrovata. Recuperi di presenze albanesi nella cultura e nell'arte del Cinquencento veneto. Tirana: Onufri, 2012, p. 48 The book also discusses the Ottoman siege of Shkodra in 1474. The book was originally published in 1504, in Latin, as De obsidione Scodrensi.Barletius, Marinus. De obsidione Scodrensi. Venice: Bernardino de Vitabilus, 1504. Barleti was an eyewitness of the events.Elsie, Robert. Historical Dictionary of Albania. Toronto: The Scarecrow Press, 2010. p. 34. Outline =Prefatory note= The Doge Leonardo Loredan, addressee of The Siege of Shkodra. Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan by Giovanni Bellini (1501) The work begins with a prefatory note to the doge of Venice, Leonardo Loredan, with Barleti describing his reasons for writing. Then the work is organized into three large chapters called ‚Äúbooks.‚Äù =Book One= The first and briefest book gives attention to historical background information about the Turks, the Ottoman sultans, and the city of Shkodra. =Book Two= The second and largest book describes Mehmed ºs failed efforts to conquer Shkodra in 1474 and continues with a detailed account of his second effort in 1478 (which was ultimately successful despite significant Ottoman losses). In this second book, Barleti describes details of the pre-siege incursions of the akinci, the build-up of Ottoman troops, information about how janissaries were trained, the arrival of camels and chariots with equipment, the production and positioning of artillery around Shkodra‚Äôs Rozafa Fortress, the arrival of Sultan Mehmed II in Shkodra, the assault of the cannons (including daily tallies of shots fired), the life and faith of the Shkodran besieged, and five general Ottoman attacks intended to penetrate the breaches in the walls‚Äîall of which conclude in failure to conquer the citadel. =Book Three= The third book describes the sultan ºs decision to halt further attacks upon Shkodra but to attack three smaller citadels aiding Shkodra: ≈Ωabljak Crnojeviƒáa, Drisht, and Lezha. After describing the successful Ottoman conquest of these cities, the third book records the sultan retreating after ordering a siege force in place in an attempt to starve the Shkodran citizens into surrender. The work concludes with the Shkodran besieged learning of a peace treaty between Venice and Mehmed II, in which Shkodra is ceded to the Ottoman Empire. The citizens are reported to be faced with a choice to either emigrate to Venice or to stay in their city under Ottoman rule. Barleti records all the Shkodrans choosing emigration over subjugation. Versions The Siege of Shkodra was first published in Latin (in 1504 and later in 1576) and was translated and published in Italian (1565 with subsequent reprintings), in Polish (at Brest- Litovsk, 1569), and French (at Paris, 1576).Buda, Aleks. \\"Hyrja\\" [Introduction] to Barleti, Marin. Rrethimi i Shkodr√´s. Tirana: Universiteti Shtet√´ror i Tiran√´s, 1967. In 1962 it was published in Albanian and reprinted in 1967, 1980, 1988, and 2012. In 2012 it was also published for the first time in English. File:Page from Table of Contents of De obsidione Scondrensi.jpgPage from Table of Contents of De obsidione Scodrensi, 1504 File:1962 Cover of RRETHIMI I SHKODRES.jpgCover of 1962 Albanian version = The Latin Version = The first Latin version emerged in 1504, published by the Venetian Bernardino de Vitalibus. It was republished in 1566 in Basel, Switzerland and in 1578 and 1596 in Frankfurt, Germany. In 2018 Venetian scholar Lucia Nadin discovered in Paris a manuscript by Marin Barleti, dated ca. 1500, presumed to be the original manuscript of De obsidione Scodrensi (scholars have begun to study this manuscript). = The Albanian Version = The Albanian version‚Äôs date of publishing coincided with the 50th anniversary of Albania‚Äôs declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire. The work was translated by the Albanian Latin scholar, Henrik Lacaj and included a 20-paged introduction by historian Albanian Alex Buda, the head of the Albanian Academy of Sciences. The Albanian version also included Buda‚Äôs scholarly notes (endnotes), George Merula‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúThe War of Shkodra‚Äù (about the siege of 1474), and Marin Be√ßikemi‚Äôs panegyric delivered to the Venetian Senate. = The English Version = The English version was published in Albania by Onufri Publishing House in 2012, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of Albania‚Äôs declaration of independence. The work was translated and edited by David Hosaflookhttp://www.mapo.al/2012/12/03/pastori-si-e-solla-ne-anglisht- barletin-qe-takova-ne-rruge/ and includes translations of Buda‚Äôs introduction and notes, Merula‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe War of Shkodra,‚Äù and Be√ßikemi‚Äôs panegyric. It also includes accounts of the siege of Shkodra from early Ottoman historians, new scholarly notes, the historical context by Prof. David Abulafia, new maps based on the information in the book, and appendixes including Barleti's chronology of battle events. Significance Albanian historians such as Alex Buda consider the work \\"the first Albanian historiographical work\\" by \\"the first author in [Albania's] literature.\\" Lucia Nadin asserts claims that the work was well known throughout the centuries in all of Europe. Subsequent historians to the present day who treat the events of the siege of Shkodra frequently reference this work. Criticism and Defense The Siege of Shkodra has been criticized by foreign historians who claim that Barleti exaggerated his reports of the numbers of Ottoman soldiers and camels employed and that he invented speeches by the sultan and the sultan‚Äôs commanders. Franz Babinger asserts that ‚Äúthis account has long been regarded as untrustworthy because of its bias and the high-flown speeches which, in the classical manner, it puts into the mouths of protagonists who could never have spoken in such a way. It deals at great length with the nature and employment of Ottoman siege machines, providing information that can be appraised only by experts in the history of weapons‚Äù.Babinger, Franz, Ralph Manheim, and William C. Hickman. Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1978. p. 364. Alex Buda‚Äôs introduction to the 1962 Albanian version acknowledges as valid some of the criticisms made by foreign scholars; on the other hand, he explains that flowery language was the style of classical literature in Barleti's day, argues that not all criticism is valid, and argues why Barleti must be consulted as a reputable source (with certain caveats), noting the contemporaneous Ottoman and Venetian historians whose accounts are strikingly supportive of Barleti‚Äôs.

Van Kampen was born in Leiden, and was a nephew of Frits Zernike. He studied physics at Leiden University, where in 1952 under the direction of Hendrik Anthony Kramers he earned his PhD with thesis Contributions to the quantum theory of light scattering. He showed in his thesis how to deal with singularities in quantum mechanical scattering processes, an important step in the development of renormalization, according to Kramers.Laudatio uitgesproken door H.A. Kramers op 16 januari 1952, bij de promotie van Nicolaas Godfried van Kampen. Van Kampen made fundamental contributions to non-equilibrium processes (in particular on the master equation) and in many-body theory (especially in plasma physics). His work on non-equilibrium processes began in 1953 in the research group of Sybren Ruurds de Groot (the successor to Kramers) in Leiden. In 1955 Van Kampen joined the Institute of Theoretical Physics at Utrecht University, where he later became full professor and professor emeritus after his retirement.Rosalio F.

His monograph Stochastic processes in physics and chemistry (1981) is considered a classic. In his 2002 book Waanwetenschap (Science), Van Kampen condemned what he saw as pseudoscience, even within the scientific community; the book met with a mixed reaction‚Äîfive scientists, including , Floris Takens and Dennis Dieks, wrote a commentary on his book.Waanwetenschap als achterhoedegevecht, in Dutch from Delta (universiteitsblad), 29 January 2004. Van Kampen was an uncle of the Dutch theoretical physicist and Nobel prize winner Gerard 't Hooft, and encouraged 't Hooft to study physics in Utrecht. Van Kampen was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1973. He died, aged 92, in Nieuwegein. Quantum mechanics Van Kampen was a severe critic of non- orthodox interpretations of quantum mechanics.

Painted Dog Conservation works to engage and incorporate local communities in protecting painted dogs in Zimbabwe. The painted dog, or African wild dog, was once common in Africa with estimates of over half a million spread among 39 countries. Current estimates put their numbers at about 3,000 only found in Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. Since PDC's creation, Zimbabwe's wild dog population has increased from 400 to 700 individuals. Painted Dog Conservation is partnered with the Wildlife Conservation Network. Programs =Collars and road signs= Painted Dog Conservation uses catch-and-release techniques and places colored collars on the dogs to demonstrate to local ranchers that the dogs are few in numbers and have convinced many of them to not shoot at the dogs. The reflective collars, combined with signs at key crossing areas, have reduced road collisions by 50%. =Anti-poaching units= Painted Dog Conservation has created anti- poaching units staffed by locals to provide protection, gather data and collect poaching snares. =Snare wire art= The snares collected by the anti-poaching units are given to local community artists who turn them into animal sculptures. Through sales of these snares and other crafts they spread the conservation message of the painted dogs both to their own community and internationally. =Monitoring= Painted Dog Conservation uses radio collars to collect information about pack movements. This information contributes to their relocation to predator-friendly areas and to expand their range when needed. =Rehabilitation= A PDC rehabilitation facility is available for injured painted dogs until they can be re-released into the wild. =Bush camp= Painted Dog Conservation holds a free environmental bush camp for local 6th-grade school children by local guides in hopes of inspiring them in conservation. =Visitors center= Painted Dog Conservation's visitor center was completed in 2007. The center offers an education facility including a painted dog viewing platform. and an interpretive hall.

One common type of commercial bribery is the kickback. For example, a seller of goods or services from \\"Company A\\" who offers the purchasing manager of \\"Company B\\" a payment to his own account to help him secure a contract for Company B's continued business is engaging in a form of commercial bribery. Other related offenses are payola in the entertainment industry, match fixing in sports, corruption of labor union officials, and bid rigging in non-governmental contracts. United States law There is no federal statute that by its terms expressly prohibits commercial bribery generally though it is mentioned as part of the definition of aggravated felony for the purposes of US immigration law and is prohibited to induce sales of alcoholic beverages through commercial bribery. (a)(43) It is usually punishable as a felony under state law, depending on circumstances, but only 36 states have laws specifically prohibiting commercial bribery. Among them are California, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. However, the federal mail and wire fraud statutes and can be used to prosecute commercial bribery as a \\"scheme or artifice to defraud\\" if the mail or interstate wire facilities are used. In addition, use of the mails or interstate travel or communication in furtherance of a violation of state commercial bribery laws may be prosecutable in Federal court under the Travel Act. As the penalties under the federal statutes may exceed the state penalties, and the federal investigative and enforcement agencies may have superior resources, often federal prosecution is favored. New York's law against commercial bribery is contained in Article 180 of the state's penal code. It is one of the most extensive state laws against commercial bribery in the United States, and includes prohibitions against bribing labor officials, fixing sports contests, and rent gouging.

The Admiralty acquired the site in 1903 and used it as a naval oil fuel depot until it was badly damaged by aerial bombing in 1940 during the Second World War. The slipway was used as an embarkation point by troops of the US 29th Division boarding LSTs for the Normandy landings in June 1944. The site became a Royal Marines base in 1993 and went on to become the home of 539 Assault Squadron RM and its feeder unit, 10 Landing Craft Training Squadron. These units moved to RM Tamar in early 2013. The site was declared surplus to military requirements by the Ministry of Defence and bought by marine leisure business The Yacht Havens Group. The business took possession of the waterfront site on the 28 March 2014 after buying it for an undisclosed sum.

Born into poverty in Cambridge, Hobbs displayed little distinction as a cricketer until relatively late in life. After some limited early success, he began to aspire to a career in professional cricket, and a sudden improvement in 1901 made this more likely. Following the death of his father, the whole family depended on Hobbs but he was supported by Tom Hayward, a professional cricketer who played for Surrey. Hayward arranged for Hobbs to have a trial at Surrey, and after he was successful, Hobbs spent two years qualifying to play County Cricket. Hobbs was immediately successful when he made his debut for Surrey, but his batting form went into decline in the rest of his first season. However, he established himself in the following seasons as one of the best and most promising professional batsmen in England. He was chosen to tour Australia with an England team in 1907‚Äì08, and retained his place in the team when England next played Test matches in 1909. While successful, it was not until Hobbs toured South Africa in 1909‚Äì10, where he established his dominance over the feared South African googly bowlers, that he established himself fully at Test level. By the time of his next series, in Australia in 1911‚Äì12, he was regarded by critics as the best batsman in the world and scored three centuries in the series. He maintained his position as the world's leading batsman until war broke out in 1914. Hobbs established a very effective opening partnership with Wilfred Rhodes at Test level, and another with Hayward for Surrey. By 1914, Hobbs was batting in a very aggressive, attractive manner that he would never recapture again when his career resumed after the war. Early life =Childhood= Hobbs was born in Cambridge on 16 December 1882, the eldest of 12 children born to John Cooper Hobbs, a slater, and his wife Flora Matilda Berry.McKinstry, p. 21. Hobbs was born in a cottage belonging to his maternal grandfather, situated in a poor, run-down area of the town, but the family moved into their own home shortly after his birth. However, throughout his childhood, Hobbs' family remained in poverty, and conditions for the working class in Cambridge were poor.McKinstry, pp. 21‚Äì24, 29. Hobbs later wrote that, although he had a happy childhood, he had envied those who lived a more privileged life in Cambridge's more affluent areas and his childhood experiences left him with a sense of inferiority.McKinstry, p. 23. The family moved house several times during this period.Arlott, p. 18. Hobbs' father had a great love of cricket and his performances playing for a short-lived club formed by him and his colleagues led to an offer of employment as a professional cricketer at Fenner's, the cricket ground of Cambridge University. His main duties were umpiring matches on the ground and bowling in the cricket nets to undergraduates.McKinstry, p. 26. Although the pay was poor, Hobbs senior was happy to have achieved his lifetime ambition of a career in cricket. In 1889, he was appointed to the more prestigious position of groundsman and umpire at Jesus College,McKinstry, p. 31. where Hobbs junior was able to watch cricket practice and occasionally become involved, although he received little formal coaching from his father, who was reluctant to exploit his position.McKinstry, pp. 31‚Äì32. Nevertheless, Hobbs soon acquired a love of cricket from his father. Hobbs later claimed that his father rarely coached him,Arlott, p. 19. but his mother once recounted that Hobbs senior \\"trained him carefully since he was old enough to hold a bat\\".McKinstry, p. 32. From an early age, Hobbs played cricket whenever he could and his first games were played in the streets near his house.McKinstry, p. 27. He and his father frequently discussed the game and Hobbs closely followed local cricket. Hobbs was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's. In 1891, he moved to York Street Boys' School, where in contrast to his previous school, his family had to pay fees for him to attend. He later wrote that he was a poor scholar but was more successful at sports. Both he and his mother later recounted that he was rarely in trouble at home or school, except when carrying out practical jokes.McKinstry, p. 28. He was also heavily involved in St Matthew's Church, and was a member of the church choir. Although his first appearance in a cricket match was as a last minute substitute playing for Jesus College choir, he played regularly for the St Matthew's choir team, which he went on to captain, and the York Street school team. He was also a founder member of a team called the Ivy Club which played on Parker's Piece.McKinstry, p. 33. During holidays, he helped his father at work on the Jesus College ground.Arlott, p. 22. In his final year at York Street, in order to supplement the family budget, he took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house where his duties mainly involved cleaning.Arlott, pp. 21‚Äì22.McKinstry, p. 35. When he left school in 1895, Hobbs initially worked as an errand boy before his father's connections at the university helped him to get a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Then, aged 16, he began a potentially more permanent career working as an apprentice gas fitter. He continued to practise hard, batting in the mornings and evenings on Parker's Piece; the cricket pitches here were poor quality and some critics have attributed Hobbs' later success to his formative years on difficult batting pitches.McKinstry, pp. 33‚Äì34. Even so, he did not stand out as a cricketer at this time, in contrast to other successful batsmen who excelled from an early age. No coaches or teams approached him and he was 18 years old before hitting his first century. Hobbs later admitted that he was a slow developer, and there seemed little realistic prospect at this time of him pursuing a career as a professional cricketer like his father, although he continued to harbour the hope.McKinstry, pp. 34‚Äì35. =Development as a cricketer= Hobbs' breakthrough came in 1901, and he began to believe he could succeed as a cricketer. His batting improved throughout the season, during which he appeared for two local sides, Ainsworth and the Cambridge Liberals. Appearing for the former against the latter, he scored 102, his first century. His performances in the season meant that he was picked for an annual charity match played between a team representing Cambridge and a team of professional cricketers brought by the Cambridge-born Surrey cricketer Tom Hayward. Hobbs was a last minute replacement, and although he scored just 26 not out, was comfortable playing against the professionals; Hobbs was delighted that he could compete at a higher level,McKinstry, pp. 38‚Äì39. and he began to understand the best way to bat effectively. At the end of the season, he was invited to play as an amateur for Cambridgeshire, even though his record in club cricket was unremarkable. He was not particularly successful,Mason, p. 21. reaching double figures just once, but his experiences in the season increased his determination to pursue a career in cricket.McKinstry, p. 39. Early in 1902, Hobbs successfully applied for the job of assistant professional at Bedford School, which he held throughout the summer term. The work mainly consisted of working as a groundsman and bowling in the nets, which left him exhausted and unhappy.Arlott, p. 23. Living away from home from the first time and working in a public school environment left him feeling socially out of his depth and he did not enjoy his cricketing duties, although he later admitted that the cricketing strength of the school improved his own batting.McKinstry, pp. 40‚Äì41. In late August, Hobbs returned to Cambridge to play as a professional for the first time. For a fee of ten shillings, he appeared for a team from the nearby town of Royston against Hertfordshire Club and Ground. Appearing in his highest level of cricket to date, Hobbs scored 119. His success delighted his family and made him a local celebrity.McKinstry, pp. 41‚Äì42. Hobbs' father had helped to arrange his appearance in the match but was already seriously ill with pneumonia, and he died a week after his son scored his century, on 3 September 1902. His death left his wife and children facing great financial hardship. Given the local reputation and respect for Hobbs senior, a local committee formed to raise money to support his family. To this end, a fundraising match was organised on Parker's Piece. Tom Hayward brought a team of well-known professionals, including several of his Surrey team-mates; the match was a resounding financial success and went a long way to easing any financial difficulties for the Hobbs family.McKinstry, pp. 42‚Äì43. Hobbs assumed his father's duties as groundsman at Jesus college in the winter of 1902‚Äì03. While working there, one of his colleagues and a friend of his father, F. C. Hutt, got in contact with Hayward to ask him to arrange a trial for Hobbs, with a view to joining Surrey. Consequently, in late 1902, Hayward and Bill Reeves, an Essex cricketer born in Cambridge, bowled at Hobbs on Parker's Piece and he impressed Hayward.McKinstry, p. 43. Hobbs and Hutt were not certain that anything would come of this, and Hutt wrote to Essex asking for a trial, but the county never replied.Arlott, p. 24. =Surrey cricketer= alt=Two cricketers coming out of a pavilion, ready to bat Hobbs was summoned to a trial at Surrey in April 1903; after batting in the nets, he was chosen to appear in two trial matches in which he made scores of 37 and 13. The Surrey secretary subsequently offered him a position on the ground staff at the Oval with a basic wage of 30 shillings per week during the season.McKinstry, pp. 44‚Äì45. Hayward also persuaded the secretary to include a ¬£10 at the end of the 1903 season to further support the Hobbs family. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the County Championship. To appear for a county, a player had to be born in that county or to have lived there for two years.McKinstry, p. 46. To this end, Hobbs moved to London; he later wrote how much he enjoyed living in the city. He shared lodgings with a fellow Surrey youth player. Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward with some success. However, he struggled financially during the winter months despite the off-season pay provided by Surrey. In common with other Surrey cricketers at the time, Hobbs struggled to find employment outside of the cricket season.McKinstry, pp. 52‚Äì53. While qualifying, Hobbs played for Surrey's Colts side and for the \\"Club and Ground\\" Eleven, both of which were teams for young Surrey cricketers. He made some substantial scores, including 86 runs in his first match for the Club and Ground, but according to Hobbs' biographer, Leo McKinstry, \\"Just as he had done for much of his early life, [Hobbs] performed satisfactorily without doing anything startling\\".McKinstry, p. 48. He scored 480 runs at an average of 34.29, as well as taking 19 wickets as his bowling improved.McKinstry, p. 49. The following season, Hobbs played only for the Club and Ground, increased his average to 43.90, and impressed people connected with Surrey. Hobbs' sudden improvement brought about his return to the Cambridgeshire team. He impressed many critics with his batting, particularly when he scored 195 and 129 in two matches against Hertfordshire. In total, he scored 696 runs in 13 innings for Cambridgeshire, averaging 58.00.McKinstry, pp. 49‚Äì50. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, in its review of Cambridgeshire's season, commented: \\"A new player in Hobbs rendered fine services as a batsman and came out with a remarkable average.\\"Quoted in McKinstry, p. 50. First-class cricketer =Debut season= Hobbs qualified for Surrey by the beginning of the 1905 cricket season. At this time, Tom Hayward was Surrey's opening batsman but lacked a regular opening partner; following the retirement of Bobby Abel, several batsmen had been tried without success. At the time, Hobbs had only rarely opened the batting and had not done so for Cambridgeshire.Mason, p. 37. Nor was Hobbs guaranteed a place in the team as Surrey had a large playing staff with great competition for places. Even so, the cricketing press regarded Hobbs as very promising, as did Tom Hayward.McKinstry, p. 54. When Hayward captained Surrey in their opening game of the season‚Äîthe regular, amateur Surrey captain was absent‚Äîhe ensured that Hobbs played in the game against a team representing the \\"Gentlemen of England\\". With none of the recognised opening batsmen available for the match, Hayward took Hobbs out to open the batting.Arlott, p. 28. Making his debut on 24 April 1905, Hobbs scored 18 runs in the first innings and a quick-scoring 88 in the second before rain ensured the match was drawn. Several of those who played in the game were impressed, including W. G. Grace, the captain of the opposing team, and the press commented favourably on his performance.McKinstry, pp. 54‚Äì56. Following the game, the Surrey secretary, C. W. Alcock, called Hobbs into his office to congratulate him on his debut.McKinstry, pp. 56‚Äì57. The official Surrey captain, Lord Dalmeny, assumed control of the team for the following match against Essex, the club's opening County Championship match, beginning on 4 May. Hobbs retained his place and scored 155 runs in around three hours during Surrey's second innings. Hobbs later held the catch which won the game for Surrey and he was cheered from the ground by the crowd. Lord Dalmeny awarded Hobbs his County Cap as the players left the field;Arlott, p. 29. it was very unusual for a player to be awarded a cap so quickly. Press reports over the following days recognised that he was potentially a very good player.McKinstry, pp. 57‚Äì58. Hobbs maintained his form over the following weeks; he scored another century against Essex and hit 94 runs against the touring Australian cricket team.McKinstry, p. 59. However, from the beginning of June he was generally less successful. Although he scored 75 not out against Middlesex and 58 in a second match against the Australians, his next best score in the remainder of the season was 38.Mason, p. 45. He struggled to cope with a variety of bowlers and began to despair of scoring runs. The fatigue of playing cricket up to six days each week affected his batting, while in contrast to his subsequent career, his fielding was criticised by spectators and journalists.McKinstry, pp. 60‚Äì61. To attempt to recapture his form, Surrey tried Hobbs in different positions in the batting order and occasionally left him out of the side, but nothing helped.Arlott, p. 33. In all first-class cricket in the season, Hobbs scored 1,317 runs at an average of 25.82, including two centuries and four other scores over fifty. This placed him ninth in the Surrey batting averages.McKinstry, p. 64. McKinstry describes this as \\"a sound if hardly electrifying start.\\" As an occasional medium-paced bowler, he took six wickets.McKinstry, p. 61. Reviewing Surrey's season, Wisden singled Hobbs out for attention, praising his early-season form but noted how tiredness had affected him; it suggested that he was the best professional batsman Surrey had found for a long time. The Times noted that, although performing well, Hobbs had fallen short of the standards suggested by his start. Hobbs proved generally popular with his team-mates, and established a reputation as a practical joker which he maintained through his career. However, according to McKinstry, at least one member of the team was less impressed and tried to undermine Hobbs by spreading gossip that he had insulted the captain while drunk.McKinstry, pp. 61‚Äì62. =Growing reputation= Hobbs spent the winter of 1905‚Äì06 practising his batting and fielding. Consequently, he displayed greater consistency in 1906. He scored 85 in the opening game of the season against the Gentlemen of England and maintained his form throughout the season.McKinstry, p. 63. Displaying a wider range of shots, he scored four centuries, including another against Essex, and established an effective opening partnership with Hayward, who set a record for the highest aggregate of runs in a season.McKinstry, pp. 63‚Äì64. The pair shared a succession of substantial partnerships,Arlott, p. 36. although Hayward was very much the dominant partner.Mason, p. 47. Hobbs later acknowledged Hayward's influence and inspiration to him at this time.McKinstry, pp. 64‚Äì65. In total, Hobbs scored 1,913 runs at an average of 40.70 with a highest score of 162, placing him second in the Surrey averages. Wisden praised his improved fielding and commented that he was \\"one of the best professional bats of the year\\" and noted that he was likely to get even better.Quoted in McKinstry, p. 64. Surrey climbed to third place in the County Championship but faced criticism for their recruitment of Hobbs; the press suggested that it was unethical for counties to include players from outside their boundaries and suggested that the club's perseverance with Hobbs stemmed from a wish to justify signing him.McKinstry, pp. 65‚Äì66. Following his marriage and honeymoon in the winter of 1906‚Äì07,McKinstry, p. 67. Hobbs made further advances as a batsman in 1907. Unusually frequent rain during the season‚ÄîWisden described the season as the wettest ever‚Äîmeant that pitches often favoured bowlers. Hobbs adapted his batting technique to suit the conditions, improving his defence and developing a method of playing off the back foot‚Äîwith his weight transferred backwards rather than towards the ball.Mason, pp. 51‚Äì52. After beginning the season in uncertain form, he began to bat with great consistency. Showing more control of off side shots, he batted through an entire innings against Warwickshire on a pitch damaged by rain that was difficult to bat on, shared four century partnerships with Hayward in the same week in June, and hit 150 in the home match against Warwickshire in an innings praised by critics.McKinstry, p. 73. These performances brought him to the attention of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) selectors, and he was chosen for the Players in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players matches in July. He was unsuccessful in both games; in the first, at Lord's Cricket Ground, he scored 2 and 9 before being dismissed in both innings by the fast bowler Walter Brearley, and in the match at the Oval, he scored 5 and 19.McKinstry, pp. 73‚Äì74. Some commentators criticised Hobbs after these matches and suggested that he should bat more defensively as he was too cavalier in his batting. Hobbs scored a further three centuries in the season, and was selected to play in a Scarborough Festival match against the touring South African team. The South African googly bowlers had caused consternation among English batsmen that summer,McKinstry, pp. 74‚Äì75. and the googly threatened to change the nature of cricket.Mason, p. 54. Against these bowlers, Hobbs scored 78, although as Ronald Mason writes, it was on \\"a bone- hard wicket against tired bowlers ... an enjoyment rather than a business\\".Mason, p. 55. By the end of the season, Hobbs had scored 2,135 runs, averaging 37.45. He was one of only three men to pass 2,000 runs; he was second to Hayward in the Surrey averages,McKinstry, p. 75. and eighth in the national averages.Arlott, p. 42. Wisden noted his improvement, the increase in the range of his strokes, particularly on the off side, and noted that \\"no one among young professional batsmen looks to have such a bright future before him.\\"Quoted in McKinstry, p. 75. Test match cricketer =First tour to Australia= In August 1907, during the cricket season, Hobbs was selected to tour Australia with an MCC team‚Äîat the time, England teams toured under the name and badge of the MCC. Hobbs later remarked that until the improvement in his batting, he simply aimed to play for Surrey, but he realised during 1907 that a place in the England team was achievable. However, his chances of selection were increased through the rejection by four leading professional cricketers, including Hayward, of the financial terms offered for the tour. In addition, several amateur batsmen including C. B. Fry were either not asked to tour or proved unavailable.Arlott, pp. 40‚Äì41. It was acknowledged at the time,Arlott, p. 45. and by subsequent writers, that the team was not a strong one given the quality of English cricket at the time.Mason, p. 58. Even so, Hobbs was not a certain choice; the influential Archie MacLaren was critical of his batting at the time, and Hobbs may have owed his selection to the support of the Surrey amateur H. D. G. Leveson Gower. Having overcome initial reservations about leaving his wife and newly-born son, Hobbs accepted the invitation but throughout the voyage to Australia was severely affected by sea-sickness,McKinstry, pp. 76‚Äì77. a condition which was to afflict him throughout his life. To allow him to recover from his illness upon arrival in Australia, Hobbs missed the first two games of the tour, but once recovered, he played in only two of the remaining four fixtures before the Test series began. Hobbs later expressed the belief that the MCC captain, Arthur Jones was instrumental in his omission from the team as he did not rate Hobbs a good player. He also believed that Jones did not give him a chance to prove himself. But Hobbs failed with the bat on his two appearances and was subsequently left out of the team for the first Test match.McKinstry, p. 78. Even when Jones was taken ill before the game started, George Gunn, not a member of the touring team but present in Australia, was preferred to Hobbs and scored a century in the game. However, England lost the game and the performance of the amateur wicketkeeper and makeshift opening batsman Dick Young was singled out as detrimental to the team. Following effective batting performances by Hobbs in two matches after the Test, Frederick Fane, the stand-in England captain, chose Hobbs to open the batting in the second Test.McKinstry, pp. 79‚Äì80. He made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne.McKinstry, p. 80. He went in to bat on the second day after Australia had scored 266; in 182 minutes, he scored 83 runs in his first innings and although he batted more slowly than usual, critics praised his defence.McKinstry, p. 81. Eventually, England needed 282 to win. Hobbs and Fane added 54 for the first wicket;McKinstry, p. 82. before Hobbs fell for 28 but England went on to win the match by one wicket. Hobbs retained his place for the rest of the series. In the third Test, he scored 26 and 23, although he was forced to retire hurt in the latter innings.Mason, p. 62. In the fourth match, he scored 57 on a pitch badly affected by rain, adopting a policy of attacking the bowling and hitting 10 fours. The MCC team manager commented on Hobbs' excellent technique and judgement in the difficult batting conditions.McKinstry, p. 83. He concluded his series with an innings of 72 in the final game, but could not prevent a third successive English defeat‚Äîthe home side won the five-match series 4‚Äì1.McKinstry, p. 84. Hobbs had scored 302 runs at an average of 43.14. In other first-class matches, Hobbs scored centuries against Tasmania and Victoria, totalling 876 runs at 41.71. The MCC manager praised Hobbs after the tour, but Hobbs himself did not enjoy the tour. He found the travelling tiring and felt very homesick.McKinstry, pp. 84‚Äì85. =Continued success= Although batting conditions were generally better in 1908 than the previous season, Hobbs scored fewer runs. Even so, he achieved a batting average over 40 in the County Championship and scored six centuries for Surrey.McKinstry, p. 87. One such century came in an innings of 106 on an extremely difficult pitch, which caused the ball to spin and bounce excessively, against the bowling of Colin Blythe, regarded as extremely effective in such conditions. In the Gentlemen v Players match, Hobbs scored 81, in contrast to his lack of success during his first appearance.McKinstry, pp. 87‚Äì88. On the other hand, he struggled against Yorkshire, the County Champions that year, scoring 33 runs in four innings against the team.Mason, p. 65. In all first-class games, Hobbs scored 1,904 runs at 37.33. For his achievements that season, Hobbs was chosen as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation noted that \\"at the present time there is perhaps no better professional batsman in England except Hayward and Tyldesley\\". Hobbs began the 1909 season with a succession of large scores. In his second game, he scored a hundred before lunch on the first day against Hampshire. He eventually reached 205, his maiden double-hundred, sharing a partnership of 371 in 165 minutes with Ernie Hayes, albeit on an easy batting pitch against a team lacking effective bowlers.McKinstry, pp. 88‚Äì89. In the following game, Hobbs scored 159 against Warwickshire and shared an opening partnership of 352 with Hayward, then top-scored in the first innings of Surrey's victory over the touring Australian team. Surrey then played Warwickshire again, and Hobbs scored a century in each innings before hitting 99 against Essex in the next match. Such form placed him in contention for a place in the England team to play Australia, but the strength of English batting at the time meant that he was not a certainty. Furthermore, the England captain, Archie MacLaren, remained unconvinced that Hobbs possessed the required quality. However, the Surrey captain, Leveson-Gower, was a selector that year. He persuaded the committee to include Hobbs in the squad, then convinced a reluctant MacLaren to play him in the team.McKinstry, pp. 89‚Äì91. In the first Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed, from the first ball he received, by Charlie Macartney for a duck. However, the match was a low-scoring one on a pitch which made batting difficult, and Australia left England needing 105 to win. The task was not easy in the conditions, but Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out. He scored quickly off all the bowlers and England passed the target without losing a wicket.McKinstry, pp. 91‚Äì93. This innings meant that he had scored 919 runs before the end of May, but he failed to emulate W. G. Grace's achievement of scoring 1,000 runs in May when Nottinghamshire batted throughout the day when Surrey played them on 31 May.McKinstry, p. 94. England lost the second Test by nine wickets, their team much changed to the bafflement of critics and spectators, and Hobbs scored just 19 and 9.McKinstry, pp. 94‚Äì95. The home side also lost the third Test. Hobbs scored 12 and 30, the latter the highest score of the innings, but was involved in controversy in the first innings when he appeared to change his mind when about to walk off after apparently hitting his own wicket. The umpire ruled him not out, to the fury of the Australians who loudly protested for some time. Hobbs was out to a very straightforward delivery almost immediately after; some critics, including the Australian captain, believed he allowed himself to be dismissed because he thought the umpire was wrong, but Hobbs later wrote that the incident unsettled him and he lost concentration.McKinstry, pp. 95‚Äì96. In his next game, Hobbs badly injured his finger and missed the remainder of the Test series;McKinstry, p. 96. in three games, he scored 132 runs at an average of 26.40. England lost the series when the remaining two matches were drawn. Hobbs struggled to regain his form when he recovered from the injury and his scoring was inconsistent, but he still finished the season with 2,114 runs at 40.65. However, nearly half of those runs came in the first month of the season, and he passed 40 only four times in his last 20 innings. Surrey also had a difficult season, falling from third to fifth and losing the services of three players including the amateur Jack Crawford following internal disciplinary issues.Arlott, p. 51.Mason, pp. 71‚Äì72. =Dominance in South Africa= McKinstry notes that, by the end of the 1909 season, Hobbs had not really established himself at international level and his career \\"seemed in danger of stagnating\\".McKinstry, p. 98. Invited to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC, Hobbs had no hesitation in accepting, needing to support his family financially.McKinstry, p. 99. However, a tour to South Africa was not prestigious; many leading cricketers were missing from the touring team and others were selected who were a long way from the first-choice eleven. The team faced a challenging tour, playing on matting pitches, with which English players were unfamiliar, and against the South African googly bowlers,McKinstry, pp. 99‚Äì101. who had caused tremendous difficulties for English batsmen both in 1907 and particularly on their home pitches on the last MCC tour in 1905‚Äì06. The leading players had found no answer to the four South African googly bowlers; critics and analysts believed a new batting method was needed to defeat the relatively new delivery.Mason, p. 72. In the absence of other players, Hobbs was expected to be the leading batsman on the tour. When the tour began, local press disregarded Hobbs on the evidence of his first practice sessions on matting pitches, but he subsequently scored centuries in the first two matches,McKinstry, p. 102. including one in a first-class match. Hobbs was chosen for the first Test against South Africa; the MCC captain, Leveson- Gower, selected Wilfred Rhodes to open the batting with him. Rhodes, who began his career as a bowler who batted down the batting order but steadily improved his batting until he became an opening batsman,McKinstry, p. 103. went on to establish a successful opening partnership with Hobbs in the years until the First World War. A particular hallmark of their association was quick running between the wickets, and when they batted on the first day in response to a South African total of 208, they immediately began to score singles by pushing the ball just past nearby fielders and running quickly. The tactic was initially a response to the difficulty of facing the bowlers on a matting pitch, but was successful as they added 159 runs for the first wicket.McKinstry, p. 105.Arlott, p. 55. Hobbs scored 89 in the first innings and 35 in the second, and although England lost narrowly, he appeared much more comfortable than the other English batsmen against the googly. Hobbs and Rhodes followed up with a partnership of 207 in the match following the Test, and Hobbs scored 163.Arlott, p. 56. England also lost the second Test, but Hobbs continued to impress critics; he scored 53 and 70, sharing two substantial opening partnerships of 94 and 48 with Rhodes in the process. The failure of the other batsmen, defeated by the googly bowlers, caused consternation in the English press.McKinstry, pp. 105‚Äì06. As England had few effective pace bowlers on the tour, Hobbs opening the bowling in the first two Tests, as well as the batting.McKinstry, p. 110. Hobbs failed in the first innings of the third Test, batting down the order owing to illness. In the second innings, he scored 93 not out in 130 minutes, batting at number five in the order, and despite another failure by the other English batsmen, guided England to a three-wicket victory. He received a rapturous welcome from the crowd and his team-mates.McKinstry, pp. 107‚Äì08. However, the series was lost when England were defeated in the fourth match; Hobbs scored 0 and 1, the only time in his Test career that he failed to reach double figures in either innings, and his worst return in first-class cricket.McKinstry, p. 108. Then in the final game of the series, he scored his first Test hundred, opening the batting and sharing a partnership of 221 with Rhodes which was a record at the time for the first wicket in Test matches. Hobbs batted for 225 minutes in total and scored 187, an innings praised by Wisden for its \\"brilliancy\\".McKinstry, p. 111. Later, he once more opened the bowling, dismissing Reggie Schwarz, his only Test wicket. England won the match by nine wickets and the series finished 3‚Äì2. Hobbs scored 1,124 first-class runs at an average of 66.11 on the tour, while in the Test matches, he scored 539 runs at 67.37. Wisden commented: \\"Beyond everything else from the English point of view the feature of the trip was the superb batting of Hobbs, who easily adapted himself to the matting wickets and scored from the famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility. When they came home the other members of the team could not say too much in his praise.\\" Syd Gregory, an Australian Test batsman who was visiting South Africa, described Hobbs as the best batsman in the world in a press interview following the series. His success against the googly arose from either reaching a long way forward or stepping back near his stumps in order to play the ball;this meant that he either smothered the ball so that it did not spin or allowed him time to see which way it would spin and play accordingly. He also adopted cautious tactics, preferring to wait for an easy delivery to hit for runs rather than play aggressively; the orthodox approach at the time was to attempt to hit googly bowling aggressively.McKinstry, p. 106. Hobbs also demonstrated an ability to judge very effectively where the ball would land after it had been bowled.Arlott, p. 57. This judgement, allied to an instinctive knowledge of what the bowler was trying to do and an increasing ability to judge from the bowler's wrist allowed him to predict when a googly had been bowled. As such, he encountered far fewer difficulties than other batsmen in playing googly bowling. According to Ronald Mason, after Hobbs' success, the South African googly bowlers were never as effective.Mason, p. 75. =Leading batsman in England= As the leading batsmen of the previous decade fell into decline, Hobbs' success in South Africa meant he was, according to McKinstry, \\"beyond dispute, seen as the finest batsman in the country\\".McKinstry, p. 114. However, a combination of a wet summer, the effects of switching from matting pitches to grass ones, and tiredness from having played cricket for 18 months without a substantial break meant that Hobbs record was poor in 1910. He did not enjoy the season owing to fatigue and scored 1,982 runs at an average of 33.03, the lowest average of his career apart from his first season.McKinstry, p. 119.Arlott, p. 58. He was more effective during 1911, after a long rest during the winter. The summer was hot and dry, leading to better batting pitches. Although Hobbs played few outstanding innings, he was consistently successful,Mason, p. 76. and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68. Bowling more frequently than in other seasons, Hobbs also took 28 wickets. Against Oxford University, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career. While Hobbs may have been frequently dismissed having scored between 40 and 70 runs, his best innings were played in the most pressurised games.McKinstry, p. 120. In the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, Hobbs carried his bat through the second innings for 154 in 195 minutes against a varied bowling attack, containing highly regarded bowlers, on a very difficult pitch; the next highest score was 41 and the team were bowled out for 292.Arlott, p. 59. =Success in Australia= Hobbs was an automatic selection for the MCC tour of Australia in the winter of 1911‚Äì12, and in previewing the series, former Australian captain Harry Trott saw Hobbs as the key batsman.McKinstry, p. 121. Hobbs once more suffered from sea-sickness on the journey, even travelling by land to meet the team's ship at Marseilles to reduce his time on the water.McKinstry, p. 122. After scoring 43 when the team stopped in Colombo on the way, Hobbs and the MCC arrived in Australia in October 1911.McKinstry, p. 123. The side faced immediate difficulties when their captain, Pelham Warner became seriously ill shortly after scoring 151 in the opening game. Warner named Johnny Douglas his replacement as leader, a decision which pleased the team and Hobbs, an admirer of Douglas, in particular. However, several leading batsmen struggled for form in the opening games, including Hobbs.McKinstry, p. 124. Affected by sunstroke, Hobbs highest score, and only fifty, in seven innings before the Tests began was 88. Nor did Douglas' captaincy convince Australian critics at first.Mason, p. 85. Problems continued during the first Test, which Australia won by 146 runs, and Douglas faced severe criticism of his leadership. Hobbs scored 63 in the first innings, although by his own admission he did not play well, and 22 in the second. Although Rhodes was in the team, he did not open the batting owing to his poor form, and Hobbs opened with Septimus Kinneir.McKinstry, p. 125. For a time following the Test defeat, Douglas' position was under threat. Douglas met with Hobbs and two other senior professionals to discuss how he could improve as captain, and Warner summoned Hobbs and the leading professionals to his sickbed to discuss the captaincy. Several thought Douglas should be replaced but Hobbs argued in his favour and Douglas remained in the post following a vote.McKinstry, pp. 125‚Äì26. England went on to win the second Test; after bowling Australia out for 184 in the first innings, the visiting team faced a target of 219 to win in the fourth innings. Hobbs and Rhodes, restored to the opening position, began with a partnership of 57. Hobbs scored 126 not out, his first century against Australia, and scored particularly well from the bowling of Ranji Hordern, a googly bowler who had taken 12 wickets in the first Test.McKinstry, p. 126. Wisden commented that Hobbs \\"played one of the finest innings of his life\\", and England won by eight wickets. Australia were once more bowled out for a low score in the third Test; this time Hobbs and Rhodes added 147 for the first wicket and Hobbs scored 187. Clem Hill, the Australian captain, attempted to slow the scoring through the placement of his field,Mason, pp. 88‚Äì89. a tactic Hobbs combated by careful placement of the ball past the fielders. Hobbs played more attacking cricket after passing 100, scoring more quickly but making more mistakes. The intense heat also affected him and he was exhausted when finally dismissed. England reached a total of 501 and won the match by seven wickets. The press praised Hobbs and the Manchester Guardian noted that the batsmen seemed to have finally conquered the googly.McKinstry, p. 127. Australia, already behind in the series, faced disruption within the team before the fourth Test when Hill, the captain, came to blows with Peter McAlister, the chairman of selectors, over a dispute regarding the control of the Australian team.McKinstry, pp. 128‚Äì29. Then in damp conditions, Australia were bowled out for 191 in their first innings. At the end of the first day, Hobbs and Rhodes had scored 54 together, and the next day they took their partnership for the first wicket to 323, setting a new record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches. Their partnership remained an overall Test record for 22 years and the highest for the first wicket until 1948. As of 2012, this remains England's highest opening partnership against Australia. The pair scored easily from the bowling but faced criticism for slow batting. Even so, Hobbs reached a century in 133 minutes and proceeded to play more aggressively afterwards. He was dismissed for 178 after batting for four-and-a-half hours.McKinstry, p. 129. The press and players praised the partnership and in particular the quality of the running between the wickets.McKinstry, p. 130. England reached a total of 589 and bowled Australia out for 173 to win the match by an innings and regain the Ashes. In a speech following the game, Hill identified the batting of Hobbs as the crucial factor in the English victory.McKinstry, pp. 130‚Äì31. England also won the final Test to take the series 4‚Äì1; Hobbs scored 32 and 45, sharing a partnership of 76 with Rhodes in the second innings.McKinstry, p. 133. Hobbs ended the series with an aggregate of 662 runs at an average of 82.75, setting a new record number of runs for an individual batsman in a Test series. Jack Crawford, now living in Australia, was struck by the improvement in Hobbs since they had played together at Surrey, noting that he seemed to possess no weaknesses. In his review of the tour, Warner said: \\"I have long since exhausted my vocabulary of praise in favour of Rhodes and Hobbs, and, thanks in a very large degree to their superlative work, our batting was eminently successful. Too much stress cannot be laid on what they accomplished, for in innings after innings they gave us a wonderful start. They were the backbone of the batting.\\"Green (ed.), p. 357. In addition, Hobbs ran out 15 batsmen and Warner praised his fielding at cover point.Green (ed.), p. 356. The Australians did not dare run when he fielded the ball for fear of the speed of his throw.McKinstry, p. 132. In all first-class matches, Hobbs scored 943 runs at 55.47. =Triangular tournament= The 1912 season was unusually wet,McKinstry, pp. 136‚Äì37. which caused many games to be rained off and produced some very difficult batting wickets.Mason, pp. 96‚Äì97. For Surrey, Hobbs was as successful as in previous years. Surrey had a poor season and Wisden remarked that Hobbs did not bat as well for his county as for his country.Mason, p. 99. His batting approach also differed from that which he adopted for England; he tried to attack at all times and attempted shots he dare not risk in a Test. Consequently, he lost his wicket on several occasions trying to score quickly, and the press criticised him for recklessness, although spectators responded well to his tactics.McKinstry, p. 140. Wisden also described his batting in the Gentlemen v Players match as \\"reckless\\", but he scored 94 for the Players at Lord's and 54 in 20 minutes at the Oval. During the summer, both Australia and South Africa toured England, taking part in the Triangular Tournament. The competition was not a success owing to the poor weather and the inability of South Africa to compete with the other two teams. Also, several leading players were absent from the Australian team owing to the continuing dispute between them and the Australian Board of Control. In addition, spectators lost interest in the tournament because it took too long to complete. As a result, England's eventual victory lacked the prestige that had been expected before the season. Hobbs made a slow start to the competition when he was bowled in the first over in England's opening match against South Africa, and his batting form in all matches was uncertain in the early part of the season.McKinstry, p. 137. However, he scored a century against Australia at Lord's on a very difficult batting pitch in England's next game, sharing a partnership of 112 with Rhodes. He continued with scores of 55 and 68 in the next two games against South Africa, and his batting was praised by the press; for the first time, in the Times, he was referred to as \\"a great master\\".McKinstry, pp. 137‚Äì38. South Africa were defeated in all three Tests played against England, and in two out of three (the third was drawn) by Australia. With the first two games between England and Australia drawn, the final match between these teams was designated as the deciding match for the tournament.McKinstry, pp. 138‚Äì39. Hobbs and Rhodes opened with 107, and Hobbs scored 66. These runs were crucial and England won the game by 244 runs. Hobbs also ran out Warren Bardsley in Australia's second innings, although there was controversy over the umpire's decision to rule him out.McKinstry, p. 139. Hobbs came top of the batting averages for the tournament,Arlott, p. 61. and in the final Test passed 2,000 runs in Test matches. In judging his performance in the season, Sydney Pardon, the editor of Wisden, wrote: In Tests, Hobbs averaged 40.75 against South Africa and 56.00 against Australia. In all first-class cricket his aggregate was 2,042 runs at 37.81. =Years before the First World War= As there was no senior cricket tour in the winter of 1912‚Äì13, Hobbs took the opportunity to have a break. He took a job as a private cricket coach to a wealthy South African's son. He and his family also moved into their own property, Hobbs now being able to afford to buy, rather than rent a house.McKinstry, pp. 141‚Äì42. In 1913, Hobbs scored 2,605 runs at an average of 50.09, placing him second in the national averages to Phil Mead.McKinstry, p. 143. Unlike the previous season, Hobbs was more controlled in his aggression. Even so, he continued to score quickly, twice scoring 100 runs before lunch on the first day of a match. He and Hayward also shared an opening partnership of 313 in 190 minutes against Worcestershire. One of his most high-profile achievements was an innings of 72 not out on a difficult pitch to guide the Players to victory over the Gentlemen at Lord's in a run-chase where time was short. Wisden described him as \\"the best bat\\" in England, and \\"one of the greatest bats of his generation\\";McKinstry, p. 144. it also paid tribute to both his consistency and ability to score runs in many different batting conditions and types of pitch.McKinstry, pp. 143‚Äì44. In the winter of 1913‚Äì14, the MCC sent a team to South Africa under the captaincy of Johnny Douglas. The team was strong, but the South African side had few effective players and the previously dominant googly bowlers were either unavailable or had lost form.Mason, pp. 102‚Äì03. The tour encountered some difficulties; South Africa was experiencing industrial disputes which resulted in several strikes, and there were uncomfortable diplomatic incidents in Boer territory. Nor did the team get along with their manager, appointed by the South African Cricket Association.McKinstry, pp. 145‚Äì46. Hobbs also experienced some uncomfortable personal incidents. In Kimberley, he was the victim of attempted fraud by an impersonator, and at Amanzimtoti, he and two team-mates were involved in a road accident as a result of which Hobbs was thrown from their car. Neither Hobbs nor the other players were seriously hurt.McKinstry, pp. 147‚Äì48. On the field, England won the five-Test series 4‚Äì0, mainly as a result of the bowling of Sydney Barnes.McKinstry, p. 148. Hobbs scored 443 runs at an average of 63.28 in the series; he did not score a century, but accumulated scores of 82, 92 and 97. With Rhodes, he shared two century opening partnerships and another of 92, although Hobbs did not open the batting in the second Test for tactical reasons.McKinstry, p. 149. Critics pointed out that Hobbs was more defensive in his approach than he was for Surrey, and Wisden noted that he was \\"not quite so brilliant as in England\\" but said that he was \\"an absolute master on matting wickets [pitches].\\" In all first-class matches, he scored 1,489 runs at 74.45. Shortly after the team returned home, the 1914 season began and Hobbs was praised in press previews of the season as the world's best batsman.McKinstry, pp. 149‚Äì50. Hobbs was awarded a benefit match by Surrey.McKinstry, p. 150. He made a slow start to the season but innings of 100 and 74 on a difficult pitch in a close win over Yorkshire marked the beginning of a series of high scores. Against Essex, he hit the highest score of his career to that point when he scored 215 not out; the next highest score was 27. He scored 183 against Warwickshire, 163 against Hampshire, 156 for the Players against the Gentlemen and two other centuries before the end of July.McKinstry, p. 151. At the same time, war in Europe was becoming more and more likely throughout the season. The day before Britain entered the First World War, against a background where it was uncertain if cricket would continue, Hobbs scored 226 against Nottinghamshire, surpassing his previous highest score despite suffering badly from a migraine.McKinstry, p. 153. Cricket continued once the war began, but Hobbs' benefit was moved from the Oval to Lord's. This move, and the public's greater concern for the war, meant that the match was a failure; in total Hobbs' benefit raised ¬£657 which was lower than most benefits and far less than raised for cricketers of Hobbs' standing. The Surrey committee attempted to increase the amount raised but eventually agreed to give him another benefit when the war concluded.McKinstry, pp. 154‚Äì55. Cricket continued for a little longer, and Hobbs scored his 11th century of the season before public pressure to cease caused Surrey to cancel their final fixtures. However, Surrey were declared County Champions for the only time in Hobbs' career.McKinstry, p. 156. In all first-class games, he scored 2,697 runs at 58.63. McKinstry notes that during the season: \\"With his free-scoring method, [Hobbs] had dazzled in a way that he was never to do again.\\" Notes References Bibliography  * * Category:Early lives by individual Category:Sportspeople from Cambridge Category:Surrey cricketers Category:English cricketers ","title":"Early life of Jack Hobbs"},{"id":"36723612","text":"Nadine Truong is a director, writer, and photographer.

It is designed as a \\"kamikaze,\\" being able to crash into its target with an explosive warhead to destroy it. The Switchblade is small enough to be carried in a backpack and can be launched from a variety of ground, maritime, and air platforms. Design The Switchblade 300 is designed as an expendable UAV to increase precision firepower for platoon-sized infantry units. It is long and weighs including the carrying case and launcher, making it small and light enough for one soldier to carry. The Switchblade is folded up inside a tube with wings unfolding once it gets airborne. It can be controlled up to but its small size limits its endurance to 10 minutes. This makes it unsuited for scouting roles, but it is useful for inexpensively engaging long-range targets and assisting in relieving units pinned down by enemy fire. The Switchblade uses a color camera and GPS locating to identify, track, and engage targets, as well as being able to be pre-programmed on a collision course. Its warhead has an explosive charge equivalent to a 40mm grenade to destroy light armored vehicles and personnel. If a situation causes a strike to be called off, the operator can call off the Switchblade and re-target it. The aircraft is propelled by an electric engine, so its small size and silent flight makes it extremely difficult to detect or try to intercept, enabling it to close in on a target at . The Switchblade uses the same Ground Control Station (GCS) as other AeroVironment UAVs including the Wasp, RQ-11 Raven, and RQ-20 Puma. This creates commonality and the potential for teaming of longer-endurance small UAVs to recon for targets, then having the Switchblade attack once they are identified with the same controller.U.S. Troops Will Soon Get Tiny Kamikaze Drone - Wired.com, 18 October 2011Tiny, Suicidal Drone/Missile Mashup Is Part of U.S.‚Äô Afghanistan Arsenal - Wired.com, 12 March 2013America's Kamikaze Drone Makes the Skies Way Less Friendly - Gizmodo.com, 5 September 2013Kamikaze drones - the military robots set to self-destruct - Army- Technology.com, 6 August 2012 U.S. Army regulations categorize the Switchblade as a missile rather than a drone, and the term \\"loitering munition\\" is preferred to describe it; unlike UAVs, it is not recoverable once launched. Its operation is similar to that of the wireless TOW missile, through a fly- by-radio frequency signal, the only difference being the TOW fires straight and doesn't loiter, but both have the same operator-in-the-loop characteristics. The Switchblade uses daytime and infrared cameras, as well as an \\"aided target tracker\\" to lock on to stationary and moving targets. The warhead is specifically designed for controlled firepower to reduce collateral damage through a focused blast, having a forward-firing shotgun-blast effect rather than a 360-degree blast, throwing pellets on the same vector that the missile itself is traveling; it can also be fused to detonate at a predetermined height, which can be adjusted in-flight. When diving, the air vehicle gives the operator the opportunity to wave off until four seconds from impact, and the warhead can be detonated in-flight to destroy it. Being unique in its abilities, the Switchblade does not fit into several established doctrines, not being an armed reconnaissance vehicle dispatched by a platoon commander to scout over an area and destroy enemies, or an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform, as its cameras are for seeing targets instead of performing recon. There is also the question of whether small squads and platoons who lack high-level intelligence and communications should have the ability to fire missiles beyond ranges they are trying to influence.'Kamikaze drones' add a new layer of lethality to remote forces - C4ISRnet.com, 13 August 2015 Aside from being used against ground targets, SRC Inc. has written software to combine the Switchblade with sensors to be able to intercept hostile UAVs. The Switchblade is used alongside an existing counter-artillery radar and IED jamming system, all of which can be towed by Humvees. Interception of an enemy drone occurs in layers of defenses: if a drone gets through covering jet fighters or is too small to be targeted by them, it is picked up by the fire-finding radar; once detected, the jammer performs electronic warfare to break its data-link; if the drone resists EW, the Switchblade is launched to physically impact and destroy it.New Weapons Spell Death For Drones; The Countermeasure Dance - Breakingdefense.com, 13 October 2014 On 28 April 2016, AeroVironment announced they had developed an upgrade for the Switchblade Tactical Missile system designated Block 10C. It incorporates a Digital Data Link (DDL) to provide a stable and secure encrypted communication link through more efficient use of existing frequency bands and significantly reduced likelihood of signal interception, as well as enables concurrent operation of multiple Switchblade systems in the same vicinity without signal conflict, gives opportunity to extend operational ranges using another DDL arbiter such as a different AeroVironment UAV, and facilitates sensor to shooter operations through automatic communication of mission plans from one AeroVironment UAS to a Switchblade.AeroVironment begins production of Switchblade Tactical Missile System upgrade - Armyrecognition.com, 29 April 2016 In October 2016, AeroVironment revealed the Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL), a system to carry and remotely launch several Switchblades. MPL comes in a standard 6-pack configuration weighing fully loaded, though design is scalable from 2 to 20 rounds and enables rapid reloading of less than 30 seconds per round.AeroVironment Introduces New Remote-Controlled Multi-Pack Launcher for its Switchblade and Blackwing Tactical Missile Systems - Businesswire.com, 4 October 2016 The U.S. Army began deploying the MPL in early 2019 for base defense.Multi-Pack Launcher Deployed for Switchblade .

Flight International. 9 October 2018. In March 2020, AeroVironment revealed it had flight tested a larger version of the Switchblade the previous year. The flights were described as \\"successful\\" for the larger design that \\"flies further and longer, and carries a much bigger mission effects or mission impact.\\" Other large loitering munitions have incorporated armor- piercing warheads, so the larger Switchblade could be fitted with an anti-tank warhead while having longer range and costing less than anti-tank missiles like the Javelin.AeroVironment starts flight testing larger Switchblade with greater range. Flight International. 5 March 2020. In October 2020, AeroVironment unveiled the Switchblade 600 loitering munition. The larger system weighs but is still man-portable and can be set up in 10 minutes. It is designed to fly out to in 20 minutes, then loiter for another 20 minutes and attack at a dash speed, carrying an anti-armor warhead designed to neutralize armored vehicles. A touchscreen tablet-based fire control system can manually or autonomously control the munition, and it is secured through onboard encrypted data links and Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module GPS with a patented wave-off capability. The Switchblade 600 was developed to meet requirements in an Army development program called Single Multi-Mission Attack Missile. By the time of its unveiling it had undergone 60 test flights from ground launches against fixed and moving targets. Other methods could include a six-pack vehicle-mounted version and by air-launch.AeroVironment Unveils Switchblade 600 Loitering Missile. Aviation Week. 1 October 2020. History The Switchblade was originally conceived by Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) before being picked up by the Army. It was first unveiled in August 2011 to fill a gap U.S. troops were facing in Afghanistan. If insurgents ambushed a patrol, options available to push back the attacks were limited. Close air support takes time to arrive, is expensive to conduct, and risks collateral damage if in urban areas. If the troops are out of range of artillery support, guided missiles like the FGM-148 Javelin are available, but also very expensive. Another problem was that small man-portable UAVs like the Raven or Puma that can spot threats have no way of quickly engaging them because available weapons are too heavy for them to carry. The Switchblade combines the man-portability, low-cost, and recon ability of small UAVs with an explosive warhead to quickly locate and destroy enemy fighters, especially in dug-in positions like rooftops or ridge lines. On 29 July 2011, the U.S. Army awarded AeroVironment a $4.9 million contract for \\"rapid fielding\\" an unspecified number of Switchblades to forces in Afghanistan. On 20 March 2012, the Army awarded a contract modification to the company of $5.1 million, totaling a $10 million order for Switchblade UAVs.U.S. Army Awards AeroVironment $5.1 Million Order for Switchblade - AeroVironment press release, 23 May 2012 In May 2012, the United States Marine Corps began the process of ordering the Switchblade loitering munition to enable an organic ability to engage targets like improvised explosive device (IED) emplacement teams. Usually when air support is called in, attackers slip away before a large UAV, attack helicopter, fighter-bomber, or quick reaction force can arrive on station. Marines sometimes couldn't get support due to other units getting mission priority. The Switchblade is small enough to fit in a Marine's ALICE pack and locks onto and tracks a target once selected.Marine Corps pursues ‚Äòkamikaze‚Äô drone - MarineCorpstimes.com, 16 May 2012 75 Switchblades were supplied to U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan in late 2012. It was awaiting final approvals for use by late October, but several successful employments had occurred by January 2013. Although the military would not confirm details about its deployment, effectiveness, distribution, or tactical employment, commanders reported that it was \\"very effective.\\" Shortly after, a joint urgent needs statement was requested by the Army theater commanders for more systems. The number requested was not specified, but was \\"dramatically more\\" than the 75 systems initially supplied and exceeded budget limitations. The Switchblade gained notoriety among soldiers using it and insurgents being targeted by it. The Army classifies it as a direct fire munition rather than a drone.U.S. Army Wants More Switchblades - Defensenews.com, 12 February 2013 Soldiers embraced it as a valuable tool, especially to reduce collateral damage. Unlike most other weapons, the Switchblade can wave off or abort a mission if the situation changes after launch, allowing it to engage a secondary target or destroy itself without inflicting casualties or property damage;Kamikaze drones: Miniature munitions for dismounted troops - Armytimes.com, 14 August 2013 the wave off capability was used over a dozen times to prevent civilian casualties that could have been caused had a man not been in the loop.

He served in World War II as an officer in the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment and was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during Operation Market Garden. After the war he worked within his family publican business, taking over as manager at Grafton's pub in London while also acting as a part-time scriptwriter. The pub served as a meeting place for many comedians, including Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers and Michael Bentine. Grafton was instrumental in ensuring the quartet were hired by the BBC for their new programme, eventually called The Goon Show. Grafton also acted as a script editor for the first three series of the show. He continued with scriptwriting for other artistes and acted as Harry Secombe's agent for over 25 years. He died in 1986, at the age of 70. Biography Grafton was born on 19 May 1916 in Westminster, London; he had a twin brother, Peter. He was educated at Westminster City School in London and Sutton Vallance School in Kent. He was commissioned into the Territorial Army in 1935. During World War II Grafton transferred as a major to the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment. He was awarded a Military Cross for his actions during Operation Market Garden, where he had been involved in hand-to-hand fighting; he also requested an artillery barrage on his own position because it was being overrun by German tanks. While waiting for his demobilisation he started writing sketches for the entertainment of the men in his command. After his demobilisation in 1946, he returned to London and became publican of Grafton's, a pub which had been in the Grafton family's possession since 1848. In addition to his duties as a publican, Grafton was also a Westminster city councillor and later a scriptwriter for the comedian Derek Roy, for use in the series Variety Bandbox. Roy was also Grafton's second cousin. One of the patrons of Grafton's was Michael Bentine, an ex- intelligence officer and comedian, who introduced Grafton to Harry Secombe; Grafton recognised Secombe's voice as one of the actors on Variety Bandbox. Secombe and Bentine introduced Grafton to two other comedians shortly thereafter, Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. When Milligan was looking for a new place to stay, Grafton offered him a room above the pub, and the four comedians used Grafton's as their meeting place. As their act developed towards what was later to become The Goon Show, Grafton would act as advisor to their comedy and careers, earning him the nickname KOGVOS‚Äî(Keeper of Goons and Voice of Sanity). With the four comics spending time at the pub, and with Grafton scriptwriting for an increasing number of people, the hostelry attracted an increasing number of friends from radio and show business, including Terry-Thomas, Jimmy Edwards, Dick Emery, Tommy Cooper, Kenneth More, Beryl Reid, Clive Dunn, Graham Stark, Tony Hancock and Larry Stephens.Carpenter, Humphrey. \\"Spike Milligan\\", Hachette, 2011. Retrieved on 24 April 2020. In 1950 Grafton used his connections within the BBC to arrange an audition for the Goons; he also secured the BBC announcer, Andrew Timothy, to act as the programme's link man. Timothy had also been a fellow officer from Grafton's old regiment during the war. The first audition tape was not successful, but a second, recorded in 1951, led to the hiring of the Goons for their first series, Crazy People; Grafton acted as script editor for this series and the following two, which were broadcast under the name The Goon Show. By this stage Grafton was acting as one of Secombe's two agents, a role he performed for over 25 years, while continuing with his career as a scriptwriter. During his writing career, Grafton wrote more than 500 programmes, including 200 sitcoms. His output included all aspects of broadcast media, with his work on the radio, such as Variety Bandbox, The Goon Show and Billy Cotton Band Show; films that included Down Among the Z Men, A Santa for Christmas and Sunstruck; and television, including The Dickie Henderson Half-Hour, Pepys and a range of programmes with Harry Secombe. Grafton was married to Dorothy (n√©e Bleackley) and the couple had two children, James and Sally. He died in Chichester, West Sussex,London General Register Office, England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes, volume 18, p. 1590 on 2 June 1986, at the age of 70; a memorial service was held at the Military Chapel of the Chelsea Barracks on 22 September that year.

Initially the project was a single web framework called Pylons, but after the merger with the repoze.bfg framework under the new name Pyramid, the Pylons Project now consists of multiple related web application technologies. Pyramid Pyramid is an open source web framework written in Python and is based on WSGI. It is a minimalistic web framework inspired by Zope, Pylons and Django. Originally called \\"repoze.bfg\\", Pyramid gathered attention mostly in the Zope and Plone community as the Open Society Institute's KARL project migrated from Plone to BFG. In 2010 it was announced that the Pylons framework will move over to using BFG as a base in version 1.5. As a result of the inclusion of BFG into the Pylons project, BFG was renamed Pyramid. =Features= Pyramid is a minimalistic, platform-independent web framework. It is persistence agnostic and is integrated both with SQL databases via SQLAlchemy and with the Zope Object Database, as well as other NoSQL databases, such as CouchDB. Pyramid allows developers to define routes using regular expressions that map to objects. Like its fellow framework Zope, Pyramid also allows hierarchical object traversal, where each part of a URL is an object containing other objects, in a way that is similar to folders in a filesystem. Pylons Web Framework Pylons Framework is an open-source Web application framework written in Python. It makes extensive use of the Web Server Gateway Interface standard to promote reusability and to separate functionality into distinct modules.The mod_wsgi project includes both Pylons and Pyramid in its list of supported major Python web frameworks. It is strongly influenced by Ruby on Rails: two of its main components, Routes and WebHelpers, are Python reimplementations of Rails features. =Structure= Pylons is well known for having a near-complete stack of third-party tools, eschewing the \\"not- invented-here\\" phenomenon. Installation, dependencies, and setup The official installation method of Pylons is through EasyInstall via the Python Package Index (PyPI), and most of the additional tools are typically installed the same way. EasyInstall also handles package dependencies when relevant. Some distributions could also package Pylons and Paste, but it is likely that any distribution's packages would lag the official distribution. Pylons may also be installed by hand by renaming its .egg file to .zip and extracting the contents. Paste is used for project setup, testing, and deployment. Using the common INI configuration format, Paste allows for multiple \\"profiles\\", so that developers can run development and deployment setups from the same codebase without revealing sensitive parts of Pylons, such as the interactive debugger, to production users. URL dispatch Currently the only widely used URL dispatcher for Pylons is Routes, a Python reimplementation of Ruby on Rails' URL dispatching, although any WSGI-compatible URL dispatcher can be used. While Routes is a separate library, it was developed for use in Pylons and its development remains closely in sync with Pylons. HTML generation Another piece of Rails adapted for Pylons is WebHelpers, which provides URL mapping based on the Routes configuration. WebHelpers also provides some utility functions for generating JavaScript code making use of the script.aculo.us and Prototype libraries. FormEncode and FormBuild are used for HTML form validation and generation; there has been some use of Mako for form generation using Mako's inheritance model. Templating Myghty was the default Pylons templating language, but as of version 0.9.6 it has been replaced by Mako.Haas, Christoph Beginning Pylons . Retrieved July 5, 2007 Both templating languages are text-based (as opposed to XML-based), and support includes, inheritance and embedding arbitrary Python code. Because of Pylons' loosely coupled layers, other templating languages can be used as well. Genshi, an XML-based templating language, can be used in lieu of either Mako or Myghty.Genshi Wiki Pylons with Genshi Retrieved July 5, 2007 Database abstraction and object-relational mapping Pylons has no default database library. Both SQLObject and SQLAlchemy are known to be used. Merger with repoze.bfg and birth of Pyramid Web Framework Pylons has developed into the Pylons Project, and the old code from Pylons 1.0 is now in maintenance-only mode. However, pursuant to the project's merger with repoze.bfg since November 2010, newer versions of Pylons are actually different from the original Pylons 1.0. Pylons developers initially planned to rewrite certain portions of the code, but they observed that the new code was approximating repoze.bfg, which led to the merger of Pylons and repoze.bfg.Pylons Project FAQ.

Background In the mid to late 1980s, the Monkees made a successful comeback. New material entered the charts, whilst their back catalogue also sold well and, as a consequence, Jones thought this would be a perfect time to produce a new solo album. Production Tracks featuring on the album, and on later expanded re-issues, were recorded between February 1986 and July 1987 at Ardent/Memphis Tennessee, Globe Studio/Sydney, Australia, Longview Farm/N. Brookfield, Massachusetts, Luxury Audio Workshop in Las Vegas Nevada, and at the Record Plant in New York. It was produced and arranged under the supervision of Jones, and co- produced by Mark Clarke, Joe Hardy and Robert Merrill. Engineering was by Tim Bomba, Bobby Cohen, Joe Henehan, Lee Watters, and Mark Weisinger. Musicians on the recording other than Jones included Mark Clarke, members of The Grass Roots, and members of The Monkees' touring band. Reception The album sold poorly, possibly as a result of poor advertising. In an interview Jones stated that ‚ÄúI just plain didn‚Äôt care to put that much energy into promoting. Perhaps I should have. I just saw it as something to do for personal enjoyment and for the fans. Lord knows I spent enough money producing it. But the 80s were so busy for us. A lot of good things were set aside.

It was begun in the 14th century and is a Grade I listed building. The church contains numerous monuments to the local Culpeper family. Building The tower is constructed in three stages. The church was begun in the 14th century and was altered and extended in the 15th century, in 1638, 1869 and 1903. The church is constructed of flint and ashlar stone work and has plain tiled roofs. It was restored in 1876 by George Gilbert Scott, Jr. and is a Grade I listed building. The nave is adjoined by aisles on the north and south sides and the chancel has a chapel on its north side and a vestry to its south. The west tower comprises three stages. A moulded string course with gargoyles is topped by a battlemented parapet. Single-light cinquefoil headed windows are located on the first stage above the west doorway and on each side of the second stage. The belfry windows are similar, but two-lighted. The north aisle is late 14th century and contains three three-lighted traceried windows, the easternmost one with a trefoiled head. The attached porch is constructed of flint with a moulded stone coping, inner and outer doorways, and trefoil- headed windows to the sides. The north aisle and the porch are both buttressed. The north chapel has an ashlar stone plinth and a battlemented parapet. Its east window is three-lighted with a segmental head. The chancel is late 14th century and was probably rebuilt after the earthquake of 1382. The east end contains a three-lighted window with cinquefoil-heads and tracery. The north and south walls of the chancel each contain two-lighted windows. The south aisle is early 14th century with a moulded stone plinth. Buttresses are positioned on the south-west corner and on the south wall. The west end wall contains a three-lighted window and three two-lighted arched and traceried windows are located between the buttress on the south wall. The vestry was built in 1903 and continues the south aisle's moulded plinth. It contains a doorway on the east side and a two-lighted window on the south side. The Culpeper Needlework is embroidered with fruit and cherubs Internally, the nave is separated from the aisles on each side with 14th- century arcades of three bays of pointed arches with octagonal columns; those to the north being later. The chapel is accessed by steps up from the north aisle and sits above a vault which partly extends under the east end of the north aisle. The nave has a crown post roof with moulded posts and chamfered tie beams. The chancel roof is of simple rafters and the roofs of the aisles are lean-tos. The font is octagonal on an octagonal stem and octagonal base. The pulpit is 17th century and hexagonal. The pews were installed by George Gilbert Scott, Jr. The vestry contains the Culpeper needlework, a 17th-century embroidery on velvet associated with the Culpeper family, thought previously to have been an altar cloth, but now believed to be a funeral pall. Monuments and memorials The church contains numerous monuments and memorials to the Culpeper family, owners of Leeds Castle and Hollingbourne Manor. These include Francis and Johanna Culpeper (d. 1591 and 1597), Philippa Culpeper (d. 1630), Elizabeth Culpeper (d. 1638) and the first, third and fourth Barons Colepeper: John Colpeper (d. 1660), John Colepeper (d. 1719) and Cheny Colepeper (d. 1725).

The film is notable for featuring John Barrowman, who later found fame in popular shows such as Doctor Who and Torchwood. Barrowman has said in an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross that he only did the film for the money, and was rather embarrassed when a clip from the film was shown. Actress Jenny McShane from the first Shark Attack film has a starring role, albeit as a completely different character. When two researchers discover a colossal shark's tooth off the Mexican coast their worst fears surface - the most menacing beast to ever rule the waters, Megalodon, is still alive and mercilessly feeding on anything that crosses its path. The film is also notable because certain clips from it have become popular internet memes due to the unconvincing special effects, size-changing shark, and bizarre dialogue. Plot A group of divers are installing a power cable at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, when a shark swims up and kills one of them. Six months later, lifeguard Ben Carpenter (from the first Shark Attack film) and his partner Esai drive out to sea to catch some lobster. While diving, Ben finds a broken power cable with a large shark tooth stuck in it. After he pulls out the tooth, he is caught by two other divers, and soon goes back to land. Later he posts a description of the tooth online, but as he cannot find a matching shark tooth on the internet, he names it \\"mystery shark\\". Natural history researcher named Cataline \\"Cat\\" Stone gets the message, finds him and looks at the tooth. She believes it to come from a huge prehistoric shark called Megalodon (Greek for \\"big tooth\\"). Ben meets with his friend Chuck Rampart, who tells him he intends to take a look at the broken power cable. Ben tells him about the shark. Later, the animal kills two people who use a waterslide in the middle of the night. The next day Cat and her partners go out on a boat to find and tag the Megalodon. The shark shows up and smashes into their boat. Davis films it while Cat hooks a camera onto the sharks dorsal fin. The Megalodon leaves and later kills a man who is playing frisbee on the beach with his dog. Ben finds the man's severed leg and informs Cat about the attack; she in turn tells him about the Megalodon, additionally saying it is a juvenile. Angry that she lied to him, he leaves. The next day Ben, Cat, Davis and another partner go out to kill the shark, which they find out is heading toward a nearby resort. They manage to drive it back out to sea, where it kills several more people. Ben tries to get his boss, Luis Ruiz, to close the beaches. Ruiz says he will, and then tells Ben to kill the Megalodon. The crew goes back out to sea to kill the shark for good. Ben stabs the animal, which in turn begins ramming the boat, knocking Davis out cold. Cat goes into the cabin to get her shotgun, but the Megalodon bursts into the boat, trying to eat her. Ben comes to her aid, beating the shark with a bat. Cat grabs her gun and shoots the shark, killing it. Afterwards, Esai arrives on his speedboat, when suddenly, the first shark's mother, a much larger Megalodon, enraged, surfaces and swallows him and his boat whole. The shark then capsizes the boat, and swallows Davis and his friend in one bite. Ben and Cat are rescued by a helicopter and leave. Ben shows Ruiz the shark tooth, but his boss still refuses to close the beaches. Later Ben and Cat go over to Chuck's house, loading a torpedo into Chuck's midget submarine. The next day, Ben and Chuck go down in the submarine. The Megalodon attacks a yacht, slamming into it a couple of times, knocking several people overboard. They escape to two large safety rafts. Ruiz steals a woman's life jacket and jumps off the yacht, only to be swallowed whole by the shark, as is one of the rafts. Tolley attempts to escape on a jet ski, but he ends up driving straight into the Megalodon's wide open jaw. Chuck then goes into the water and tags the shark. Ben eventually launches the torpedo, which succeeds in destroying the creature. Ben swims to the surface with Chuck and climbs into the raft. They all celebrate their success, elsewhere another Megalodon is shown swimming near a shore hinting there might be more Megalodons.

In an interview on Jonathan Ross, Barrowman stated the director asked him to improvise a line in order to make McShane laugh and he came up with it, and was surprised that it was kept in the film when he watched with his nephews for the first time. Unfortunately, McShane gave no reaction to Barrowman's line. The director David Worth said he had kept the line in the movie because he found it hilarious and John delivered the line so well.

By 1962, Chun King was bringing in $30 million in annual revenue and accounted for half of all U.S. sales of prepared Chinese food. Chun King was sold to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, in 1966 for $63 million. R. J. Reynolds merged with Nabisco Brands in 1985 and the new company changed its name to RJR Nabisco in the following year. In 1989, Chun King was sold by RJR Nabisco to Yeo Hiap Seng of Singapore to help pay for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts's leverage buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco had previously sold the Chun King line of frozen foods to ConAgra Foods in 1986. After losing market share, Yeo Hiap Seng sold Chun King in 1995 to Hunt-Wesson, the owner of rival La Choy. Hunt- Wesson's parent ConAgra eventually closed Chun King's manufacturing facilities and phased out the Chun King brand.

Resources are typically designed to be used by the community by which they are created.Stalder, Felix. Digital Commons: A dictionary entry. http://felix.openflows.com/node/137. 22 April 2010. Bauwens, Michel, Kostakis, Vasilis, and Alex Pazaitis. 2019. Peer to Peer: The Commons Manifesto. London: University of Westminster Press Examples of the digital commons include wikis, open-source software, and open-source licensing. The distinction between digital commons and other digital resources is that the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources.Fuster Morell, M. (2010, p. 5). Dissertation: Governance of online creation communities: Provision of infrastructure for the building of digital commons. http://hdl.handle.net/1814/14709 The digital commons provides the community with free and easy access to information. Typically, information created in the digital commons is designed to stay in the digital commons by using various forms of licensing, including the GNU General Public License and various Creative Commons licenses.  Early development  One of the first examples of digital commons is the Free Software movement, founded in the 1980s by Richard Stallman as an organized attempt to create a digital software commons. Inspired by the 70s programmer culture of improving software through mutual help, Stallman's movement was designed to encourage the use and distribution of free software.Bollier, David. Viral Spiral. How the Commoners Built a Digital Republic of Their Own. New York, London, New Press http://www.learcenter.org/pdf/ViralSpiral.pdf, 2008 To prevent the misuse of software created by the movement, Stallman founded the GNU General Public License. Free software released under this license, even if it is improved or modified, must also be released under the same license, ensuring the software stays in the digital commons, free to use.  Today  Today the digital commons takes the form of the Internet. With the internet come radical new ways to share information and software, enabling the rapid growth of the digital commons to the level enjoyed today. People and organisations can share their software, photos, general information, and ideas extremely easily due to the digital commons.Ghosh, Rishab Aiyer. CODE: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 2006 Mayo Fuster Morell proposed a definition of digital commons as \\"information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity. Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources\\". The Foundation for P2P Alternatives explicitly aims to \\"creates a new public domain, an information commons, which should be protected and extended, especially in the domain of common knowledge creation\\" and actively promotes extending Creative Commons Licenses.  Modern examples  = Creative Commons = Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization that provides many free copyright licenses with which contributors to the digital commons can license their work. Creative Commons is focused on the expansion of flexible copyright. For example, popular image sharing sites like Flickr and Pixabay, provide access to hundreds of millions of Creative Commons licensed images, freely available within the digital commons.Walljasper, Jay. All That We Share: How to save the Economy, the Environment, the Internet, Democracy, Our Communities, and Everything Else That Belongs to All of Us. New York: New, 2010. Creators of content in the digital commons can choose the type of Creative Commons license to apply to their works, which specifies the types of rights available to other users. Typically, Creative Commons licenses are used to restrict the work to non-commercial use. = Wikis = Wikis are a huge contribution to the digital commons, serving information while allowing members of the community to create and edit content. Through wikis, knowledge can be pooled and compiled, generating a wealth of information from which the community can draw. = Public software repositories = Following in the spirit of the Free Software movement, public software repositories are a system in which communities can work together on open-source software projects, typically through version control systems such as Git and Subversion. Public software repositories allow for individuals to make contributions to the same project, allowing the project to grow bigger than the sum of its parts. A popular platform hosting public and open source software repositories is GitHub. = City Top Level Domains = Top Level Domains or TLDs are Internet resources that facilitate finding the numbered computers on the Internet. The largest and most familiar TLD is .com. Beginning in 2012, ICANN, the California not- for-profit controlling access to the Domain Name System, began issuing names to cities. More than 30 cities applied for their TLDs, with .paris, .london, .nyc, .tokyo having been issued as of May 2015. A detailing of some commons names within the .nyc TLD includes neighborhood names, voter related names, and civic names.https://web.archive.org/web/20190411165010/https://www.coactivate.org/projects/campaign- for.nyc/commons.nyc = Precious Plastic = Precious Plastic is an open source project which promotes recycling of plastic through the use of hardware and business models which are available for free under Creative Commons license. It collaboratively designs and publishes designs, codes, source materials and business models which can be used by any person or group to start a plastic recycling project of their own. The online platform also consists of an online shop where hardware and recycled plastic products can be bought. As of January of 2020, more than 80,000 people from around the world are working on some type of Precious Plastic project.  Issues  = Opportunity of digital commons = The usage of digital commons has led to the disruption of industries that benefited from publishing (authors and publishers) while providing potential to other industries. Many wikis help to pass knowledge to be used in a productive manner. They also have increased opportunities in education, healthcare, manufacturing, governance, finance, science, etc. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a great example of opportunities that digital commons bring, by bringing the opportunity to access high quality education to many people. Mayo Clinic is another example of spreading the medical knowledge to public availability. Nowadays most scientific journals have an online presence as well. = Gender imbalance in digital commons = The traditional under-representation of women and the lack of gender diversity in the field of STEM and in the programmer culture is also present in digital commons-based initiatives and open-source-software projects like Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap.Nafus, D. (2012). \\"‚ÄúPatches don‚Äôt have gender‚Äù: What is not open in open source software\\" New Media and Society, 14(4), 669‚Äì683. Retrieved April 22, 2020 Also smaller initiatives, like hackerspaces, makerspaces or fab labs are characterized by a considerable gender gap among their participants.Keune, A. et al.(2019). \\"Recognition in makerspaces: Supporting opportunities for women to ‚Äúmake‚Äù a STEM career\\" Computers in Human Behavior, 99, 368‚Äì380. Retrieved April 22, 2020 There are different initiatives trying to face these challenges and bridging this gap by providing and creating empowering spaces where women and non-binary persons can experiment, exchange and learn with and from each other. Feminist hackerspaces were founded as a reaction to women‚Äôs experiences of sexism, harassment and misogyny shown by the brogrammer culture in hackerspaces. Besides closing the gender gap among participants and creating safe spaces for female and non-binary persons, some projects additionally want to visualize the under-representation and lack of gender-related topics in the movements and in the outcome of their work. The collective Geochicas for example is engaged in the OpenStreetMap community looking on maps through a feminist lens and visualize data linked to gender and feminism. One project launched during 2016 and 2017 aimed to map cancer clinics and feminicides in Nicaragua.Yang, S. (March 8, 2019). \\"\\"Geochicas, la colectiva geo-sorora\\" Revista Emancipa Retrieved April 27, 2020 In the same years Geochicas created visibility campaigns on Twitter under the hashtag \\"#MujeresMapeandoElMundo\\"GeochicasOSM (2019). \\"Mujeres, tecnolog√≠a libre e informaci√≥n geogr√°fica voluntaria\\" Retrieved April 26, 2020 and the ‚ÄúInternational Survey on Gender Representation‚Äù.Geochicas \\"\\" Retrieved April 27, 2020 In 2018 they created a virtual map by analyzing data from OpenStreetMap to rise awareness of the lack of representation of women's names on the streets of cities in Latin America and Spain.Moloney, A. (March 8, 2020). \\"'Visible women': Feminist mappers bridge data gap in urban design\\" = Tragedy of digital commons = Based on the tragedy of the commons and digital divide, Gian Maria Greco and Luciano Floridi have described the \\"tragedy of digital commons\\". As with the tragedy of the commons, the problem of the tragedy of the digital commons lies in the population and arises on two ways: # the average user of the information technology (infosphere) behaves in the way Hardin's herdsmen behave by exploiting common resources until they no longer can recover, meaning that users do not pay attention to the consequences of their behaviour (for example, by overloading of the traffic by wanting to access the webpage as quick as possible). # the pollution of the infosphere, i.e., the indiscriminate and improper usage of the technology and digital resources and overproduction of data. This brings excess information that leads to corruption of communication and information overload. An example of this is spam, which takes up to 45% of email traffic. The tragedy of the digital commons also considers other artificial agents, like worms, that can self- replicate and spread within computer systems leading to digital pollution.

A stick PC is a device which has independent CPUs or processing chips and which does not rely on another computer. It should not be confused with passive storage devices such as thumb drives. A stick PC can be connected to a peripheral device such as a monitor, TV, or kiosk display to produce visual or audio output.  History  The idea behind the creation of the Gumstix (on the left): a PC around the size of a stick of gum. There is an extension module on the right The stick PC was first introduced in 2003. The Gumstix, which came out that same year, used the ARM architecture System on a chip (SoC) and the Linux 2.6 kernel. Windows CE can be installed on this stick. It was based on the idea of making a PC similar in size to that of an average stick of chewing gum. As the popularity of smart TVs and set-top boxes to view streaming services (such as the Roku) grew, companies started looking at making these small computers even smaller and easier to use. Several stick PCs using ARM architecture SoCs were introduced around 2012, made of sticks pluggable in an HDMI port, including Android Mini PC MK802 series from Rikomagic, using Android or Linux distributions, both based on Linux and Allwinner Technology or Rockchip SoC and Cotton Candy, using Samsung Exynos SoC. 2013-2014 saw several manufacturers come out with stick PCs. MeeGoPad released the first x86 based stick PC, featuring the Intel Atom Z3735F Processor. In April 2013, Tronsmart released the MK908, using the Rockchip RK3188 (featuring the quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 and ARM Mali-400MP GPU). On July 24 2013, Google introduced the Google Chromecast, a streaming device similar in function and design to a stick PC.On November 19, 2014, Amazon released a smaller version of the Amazon Fire TV called the Fire TV Stick.

It was released for Microsoft Windows in August 2012, and for Linux and Mac OS X in May 2014. The game is played by manipulating a ship and firing on enemy ships, earning points and collecting power-ups that are dropped by the ships. The patterns for the appearance of the enemy ships are based on analysis of a selected music file, either from those that ship with the game or from those already on the user's computer. As the player completes songs, they earn new abilities they can add to their ship, while defeating specific bosses from certain songs will increase the game's difficulty level. Gameplay In Symphony, players maneuver their ship (orange, bottom right) and shoot down attacking enemies (blue and red) as to defend their music at the top of the screen. Upon first launch of Symphony, the user is given the opportunity to add existing music on their computer to the songs that ship with the game; by default this includes common locations such as the directory for iTunes and Windows Media Player. Additional folders can be added at a later time, and existing folders rescanned for new songs. The player is then given the option to select a song using a set of simple filters, or to have the game randomly select a song. The game will process the song to create the patterns of attack that the player will face. Prior to starting the actual game, the player can customize their ship in the game with any equipment earned and purchased from completing songs. The core game is otherwise like most arcade shoot-em-ups like Galaga, where the player must maneuver their ship across the bottom of the screen to evade enemy ships and fire, while firing on the enemies to destroy them and \\"protect\\" their music. Points are scored for defeating enemies and the player can earn a scoring multiplier by keeping a chain of destruction going. If the ship is hit, parts of it will fall off, but the player can collect notes left behind by destroyed ships to restore the ship. Should the ship take too much damage, the ship will respawn after a few moments, but the player's score will be penalized. The player is also penalized for allowing certain ships from remaining on screen for too long, affecting their music. Certain target scores are pre-determined for each song, with the player's goal to surpass these levels. When the song is completed, they then gain in-game currency and the opportunity to buy a new weapon for their ship. Certain songs from the player's library will randomly be selected as boss levels, where the regular attacking ships are replaced by a single, difficult-to-kill enemy. There are a total of six bosses, reflecting the six difficulty levels in the game. Defeating three bosses at one difficulty level will allow the player to access the next highest difficulty level, and the kinds of rewards that the player can earn for completing songs. Once at the sixth level, defeating the sixth boss will effectively win the game for the player. Players can opt to have their scores tracked on external servers based on the song name and artist. This creates global leaderboards so the player can compare their abilities with friends and other players. Development Symphony is the product of the two-man development team of Empty Clip Studios, Francois Bertand and Matt Shores. The game has been in development since 2008, and had an initial planned 2010 release, but subsequent development pushed the game back into 2012. One of the goals of their game was to develop their music analysis engine as to \\"capture [the] range of emotions that's uniquely present in every song\\". Symphony was awarded two prizes at the 2012 Indie Game Challenge; \\"Technical Achievement\\" (which included a $2,500 prize) and \\"GameStop PC Digital Download Award\\". On May 27, 2014, Symphony was included in a Humble Bundle in which the Linux and Mac OS X versions debuted. Reception Symphony received generally positive feedback from journalists who compared it positively to Beat Hazard and Audiosurf, two other games that procedurally generate gameplay based on the player's choice of music track. Marc Saltzman of USA Today called the title \\"fun and frantic\\" but commented that it becomes repetitive. Leif Johnson of GameSpot considered the weapon upgrade system to be a differentiation from these other games, as the randomness of such upgrades keeps the game interesting, though manipulating the upgrades can be difficult for large music libraries. A common initial complaint of the game was an input lag that slowed down the player's movements and affected their performance. The Empty Clip team was able to address this lag issue and others within the first week of its release.

Centered on the development of the 1964 film Mary Poppins, the film stars Emma Thompson as author P. L. Travers and Tom Hanks as film producer Walt Disney, with supporting performances by Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, and Colin Farrell. Deriving its title from the father in Travers' story, Saving Mr. Banks depicts the author's tragic childhood in rural Queensland in 1906 and the two weeks of meetings during 1961 in Los Angeles, during which Disney attempts to obtain the screen rights to her novels. Essential Media Entertainment and BBC Films initially developed Saving Mr. Banks as an independent production until 2011, when producer Alison Owen approached Walt Disney Pictures for permission to use copyrighted elements. The film's subject matter piqued Disney's interest, leading the studio to acquire the screenplay and produce the film. Principal photography commenced the following year in September before wrapping in November 2012; the film was shot almost entirely in the Southern California area, primarily at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, where a majority of the film's narrative takes place. Saving Mr. Banks premiered at the London Film Festival on October 20, 2013, and was released theatrically that same year in the United Kingdom on November 29 and in the United States on December 13. It received positive reviews, with praise for the acting, screenplay, and musical score. Thompson's performance garnered a BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Critics' Choice Award nominations for Best Actress, while composer Thomas Newman earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score. The film was named one of the top ten best films of 2013 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, and was also commercially successful, grossing $118 million at the worldwide box office. Plot The film, set in 1961, begins in London. Agent Diarmund Russell urges financially strapped author Pamela \\"P. L.\\" Travers to travel to Los Angeles and meet with Walt Disney. Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters to produce a film based on the books. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts, fearing what he will do to her character. Having written nothing new and her book royalties dried up, she risks losing her house. Russell reminds her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations (no animation and unprecedented script approval) before she finally agrees to go. Flashbacks depict Travers' difficult childhood in Allora, Queensland, Australia in 1906, which became the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic alcoholism resulted in his repeated dismissals, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother's attempted suicide. Goff died from tuberculosis when Travers was seven years old. Prior to his death, her mother's stern, practical sister came to live with the family and later served as Travers's main inspiration for the Mary Poppins character. In Los Angeles, Travers is annoyed by what she perceives as the city's unreality and the overly-familiar inhabitants, personified by her friendly limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers meets the creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view that she also holds of the jocular Disney. Travers' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the children's estranged father, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, the team grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to Travers and how many of the characters were inspired by her past. The team acknowledges that Travers has valid criticisms and make changes although she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to understand what troubles her, Disney invites Travers to Disneyland, which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, and the addition of a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins collaborating with the team. Soon afterward, however, Travers is enraged to discover an animation sequence has been added. She confronts Disney over this and returns home. Disney learns that \\"P. L. Travers\\" is a pen name, taken from Travers' father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she is Australian, not English. That gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her home, Disney shares his own less-than-ideal childhood but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers not to let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. That night, after Disney has left, Travers relents, granting the film rights. Three years later, in 1964, Travers has begun writing another Mary Poppins story, while Mary Poppins is to have its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches Mary Poppins with a lack of enthusiasm, particularly during the animated sequences. She gradually warms to the rest of the film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption. Cast * Emma Thompson as Pamela \\"P.

Production =Development= In 2002, Australian producer Ian Collie produced a documentary film on P. L. Travers titled The Shadow of \\"Mary Poppins\\". During the documentary's production, Collie noticed that there was \\"an obvious biopic there\\" and convinced Essential Media and Entertainment to develop a feature film with Sue Smith writing the screenplay. The project attracted the attention of BBC Films, which decided to finance the project, and Ruby Films' Alison Owen, who subsequently hired Kelly Marcel to co-write the screenplay with Smith. Marcel's drafts removed a subplot involving Travers and her son, and divided the story into a two-part narrative: the creative conflict between Travers and Walt Disney, and her dealings with her childhood issues, describing it as \\"a story about the pain of a little girl who suffered, and the grown woman who allowed herself to let go\\". Marcel's version, however, featured certain intellectual property rights of music and imagery which would be impossible to use without permission from The Walt Disney Company. \\"There was always that elephant in the room, which is Disney,\\" Collie recalled. \\"We knew Walt Disney was a key character in the film and we wanted to use quite a bit of the music. We knew we'd eventually have to show Disney.\\" In early 2010, Robert B. Sherman provided Owen with an advance copy of a salient chapter from his then upcoming book release, Moose: Chapters From My Life. The chapter entitled, \\"'Tween Pavement and Stars\\" contained characterizations and anecdotes which proved seminal to Marcel's script rewrite, in particular, the anecdote about there not being the color red in London.Sherman, Robert B. \\"Tween Pavement and Stars\\" (\\"No Red In London\\") in Moose: Chapters From My Life, AuthorHouse Publishing, Bloomington, IN, p. 372-375. In July 2011, while attending the Ischia Film Festival, Owen met with Corky Hale, who offered to present the screenplay to Richard M. Sherman. Sherman read the screenplay and gave the producers his support. Later that year, Marcel and Smith's screenplay was listed in Franklin Leonard's The Black List, voted by producers as one of the best screenplays that were not in production. In November 2011, Walt Disney Pictures' president of production, Sean Bailey, was informed by executive Tendo Nagenda of Marcel's existing script. Realizing that the screenplay included a depiction of the studio's namesake, Bailey conferred with Disney CEO Bob Iger and Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn, the latter of whom referred to the film as a \\"brand deposit,\\" a term adopted from Steve Jobs. Together, the executives discussed the studio's potential choices; purchase the script and shut the project down, put the film in turnaround, or co- produce the film themselves. With executive approval, Disney acquired the screenplay in February 2012 and joined the production with Owen, Collie and Philip Steuer as producers, and Christine Langan, Troy Lum, Andrew Mason, and Paul Trijbits serving as executive producers. John Lee Hancock was hired to direct the film later that same month. Iger subsequently contacted Tom Hanks to consider playing the role of Walt Disney, which would become the first-ever depiction of Disney in a mainstream film. Hanks accepted the role and made several visits to the Walt Disney Family Museum and interviewed some of Disney's former employees and family relatives, including his daughter Diane Disney Miller. The film was subsequently dedicated to Disney Miller, who died shortly before it was released. In April 2012, Emma Thompson entered final negotiations to star as P. L. Travers, after the studio was unable to secure Meryl Streep for the part. Thompson said that the role was the most difficult one that she has played, describing Travers as \\"a woman of quite eye-watering complexity and contradiction.\\" \\"She wrote a very good essay on sadness, because she was, in fact, a very sad woman. She'd had a very rough childhood, the alcoholism of her father being part of it and the attempted suicide of her mother being another part of it. I think that she spent her whole life in a state of fundamental inconsolability and hence got a lot done.\\" Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, B. J. Novak, and Ruth Wilson were cast in July 2012. With Disney's backing, the production team was given access to 36 hours of Travers' audio recordings of herself, the Shermans, and co-writer Don DaGradi that were produced during the development of Mary Poppins, in addition to letters written between Disney and Travers from the 1940s through the 1960s. Richard M. Sherman also worked on the film as a music supervisor and shared his side of his experiences working with Travers on Mary Poppins. Initially, Hancock had reservations about Disney's involvement with the film, believing that the studio would edit the screenplay in their co-founder's favor. However, Marcel admitted that the studio \\"specifically didn't want to come in and sanitize it or change Walt in any way.\\" Hancock elaborated, \\"I was still worried that they might want to chip away at Walt a little bit ... I thought the portrayal of Walt was fair and human so I came in and they said, 'No, we like it.' But still, every step of the way, I had my fist balled up behind my back ready to fight in case it happened, but it didn't.\\" Although the filmmakers did not receive any creative interference from Disney regarding Walt Disney's depiction, the studio did request that they omit any onscreen inhalation of cigarettes (a decision that Hanks himself disagreed with) due to the company's policy of not directly depicting smoking in films released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, and to avoid receiving an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Instead, Disney is shown extinguishing a lit cigarette in one scene, stating that nobody can see him smoking due to the effect it would have on his image. Additionally, his notorious smoker's cough is heard off-screen several times throughout the film. =Filming= The former Animation Building on the Walt Disney Studios lot, which served as a primary filming location for the film. Principal photography began in September 2012 in Los Angeles. Although some scenes were originally planned to be shot in Queensland, Australia, all filming, except for two establishing shots in London, took place in the Southern California area, including the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Big Sky Ranch in Simi Valley, the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia, Heritage Square Museum in Montecito Heights, Ontario International Airport in San Bernardino, Courthouse Square at Universal Studios, and the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. The largest set built for the film was the interior of the Walt Disney Studios' Animation Building, which production designer Michael Corenblith referred to as \\"a character in the story\\". The exterior of the Beverly Hills Hotel and Disney's personal office were also recreated, with the Langham Huntington in Pasadena acting as an interior double for the Beverly Hills Hotel. To ensure authenticity, Corenblith used photographs and a furniture display from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library as references for Disney's office; the set was also adorned with Disney's personal Academy Awards loaned from a Walt Disney World Resort exhibit. For the Disneyland sequences, scenes were shot during the early morning with certain areas cordoned off during the park's operation, including the park's entrance courtyard, Main Street U.S.A., Sleeping Beauty Castle, Fantasyland, and the King Arthur Carrousel attraction. Extra roles were filled by Disneyland Resort cast members. In order for the park to be portrayed accurately in the story's time period, Corenblith had the Main Street storefronts redressed to reflect their 1961 appearance; post-1961 attractions were kept obstructed so they would not show up on camera. To recreate the original film's premiere at the Chinese Theatre, set designers closed Hollywood Boulevard and recreated the street and theater to resemble their 1964 appearances. After scheduled filming in Australia had been scrapped, cinematographer John Schwartzman compared the landscape of Queensland with that of rural Southern California, and realized that both had similar traits in natural lighting. Emma Thompson prepared for her role by studying Travers' own recordings conducted during the development of Mary Poppins, and also styled her natural hair after Travers', due to the actress's disdain for wigs. To accurately convey Walt Disney's midwestern dialect, Tom Hanks listened to archival recordings of Disney and practiced the voice while reading newspapers. Hanks also grew his own mustache for the role, which underwent heavy scrutiny, with the filmmakers going so far as to match the dimensions of Hanks' mustache to that of Disney's. Jason Schwartzman and B. J. Novak worked closely with Richard M. Sherman during pre-production and filming. Sherman described the actors as \\"perfect talents\\" for their roles as himself and his brother, Robert. Costume designer Daniel Orlandi had Thompson wear authentic jewelry borrowed from the Walt Disney Family Museum, and ensured that Hanks' wardrobe included the Smoke Tree Ranch emblem from the Palm Springs property embroidered on his neckties, which Disney always wore. The design department also had to recreate several of the costumed Disney characters as they appeared in the 1960s. Filming lasted nine weeks and was completed on November 22, 2012. Walt Disney Animation Studios reproduced animation of Tinker Bell for the scene that recreates an opening segment from an episode of Walt Disney Presents. =Music= Thomas Newman composed the film's original score. In regards to incorporating his own musical style to the film's period setting, Newman stated that \\"there was room for a real tune- based score here that could reflect the basic joy in that kind of writing that the Sherman Brothers brought to Mary Poppins. Newman, however, refrained from creating an \\"adaptation score\\" of the Shermans' music from the original film. Newman's process of scoring the film included playing themes to filmed scenes, so that he could \\"listen to what the music does to an image\\", and not wanting to \\"clutter the proceedings with music.\\" The flashback sequences to Travers' childhood provided the most work for Newman. He explains that, \\"You had to turn on a dime to make the transition back to the 'present,' when Travers and the Sherman brothers are working on the script for Mary Poppins. And that was fun, but also musically challenging.\\" For the score's instrumentation, Newman primarily employed a string orchestra with some woodwinds and brass, as well as including piano and hammered instruments that were \\"appropriate to the time period\\", such as dulcimers. The film's score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, while the cast recorded several of the Shermans' songs at Capitol Studios for use as playback during the film's diegetic music scenes, including \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\", \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\", \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\", \\"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\\", \\"Feed the Birds\\", and \\"Let's Go Fly a Kite\\". Walt Disney Records released two editions of the soundtrack on December 10, 2013: a single-disc and a two-disc digipak deluxe edition, containing original demo recordings by the Shermans and selected songs from Mary Poppins. Historical accuracy Saving Mr. Banks depicts several events that differ from recorded accounts. The premise of the script, that Walt Disney had to convince P.L. Travers to hand over the film rights, including the scene in which he finally persuades her, is fictionalized. Disney had already secured the film rights (subject to Travers' approval of the script) when she arrived to consult with the Disney staff. In fact, Disney left Burbank to vacation in Palm Springs a few days into Travers' visit and was not present at the studio when several of the film's scenes depicting him to be present actually took place. As such, many of the dialogue scenes between Travers and Disney are adapted from letters, telegrams, and telephone correspondence between the two. Although Travers was assigned a limousine driver, the character of Ralph is fictionalized and intended to be an amalgamation of the studio's drivers. In real life, Disney story editor Bill Dover was assigned as Travers' guide and companion during her time in Los Angeles. The film also depicts Travers coming to amicable terms with Disney, implying her approval of his changes to the story. In reality, she never approved of softening the harsher aspects of Mary Poppins' character, remained ambivalent about the music, and never came around to the use of animation. Disney overruled her objections to portions of the final film, citing contract stipulations that he had final cut privilege. Travers had initially not been invited to the film's premiere until she embarrassed a Disney executive into extending her an invitation, which is depicted in the film as coaxing Disney himself. After the premiere, she reportedly approached Disney and told him that the animated sequences had to be removed. Disney dismissed her request, saying, \\"Pamela, the ship has sailed.\\" Although the film portrays Travers as being emotionally moved during the premiere of Mary Poppins, overlaid with images of her childhood, which is implied to be attributed to her feelings about her father, co-screenwriter Kelly Marcel and several critics note that in real life, Travers' show of emotion was actually a result of anger and frustration over the final product. Reportedly, Travers felt that in the end, the film betrayed the artistic integrity of her work and story's characters. Resentful over what she considered poor treatment at the hands of Walt Disney, Travers vowed never to permit Disney to adapt her other novels for any purpose. Travers' last will bans all American adaptation of her works to any form of media. According to the Chicago Tribune, Disney was \\"indulging in a little revisionist history with an upbeat spin,\\" adding, \\"the truth was always complicated\\" and that Travers subsequently viewed the film multiple times. English writer Brian Sibley found Travers still gun-shy from her experiences with Disney when he was hired in the 1980s to write a possible Mary Poppins sequel. Sibley reported that Travers told him, \\"I could only agree if I could do it on my own terms. I'd have to work with someone I trust.\\" Regardless, while watching the original film together, the first time Travers had seen it since the premiere, she became excited at times and thought certain aspects were excellent, while others were unappealing. The sequel never went to production and when approached to do a stage adaptation in the 1990s, she acquiesced only on the condition that British writers and no one from the film production were to be directly involved with the musical's development. The film also depicts Travers' Aunt Ellie (her mother's sister), who comes to help the family when her father becomes terminally ill, as Travers' model for Mary Poppins, with the actress even using several of Poppins' catchphrases from the film. In fact, Travers identified her great-aunt Helen Morehead (her mother's aunt), as the model for Poppins. Release Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures released a trailer for the film on July 10, 2013. Saving Mr. Banks held its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square as the closing gala of the London Film Festival on October 20, 2013. On November 7, 2013, Walt Disney Pictures held the film's U.S. premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre during the opening night of the 2013 AFI Film Festival, the same location where Mary Poppins premiered. The original film was also screened for its 50th anniversary. Saving Mr. Banks also served as the Gala Presentation at the 2013 Napa Valley Film Festival on November 13, and was screened at the AARP Film Festival in Los Angeles on November 17, as Disney heavily campaigned Saving Mr. Banks for Academy Awards consideration. On December 9, 2013, the film was given an exclusive corporate premiere in the Main Theater of the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank. The film was released theatrically in the United States on December 13, 2013, and in general theatrical release on December 20. Saving Mr. Banks grossed $83.3 million in North America and $34.6 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $117.9 million, against a budget of $35 million. The film grossed $9.3 million in its opening weekend in the United States, finishing 5th at the box office behind The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug ($31.5 million), Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues ($26.2 million), Frozen ($19.6 million), and American Hustle ($19.1 million). Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Saving Mr. Banks on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on March 18, 2014. The film debuted at No. 2 in Blu-ray and DVD sales in the United States according to Nielsen's sales chart. The home media release included three deleted scenes that were cut from the film. Reception =Critical response= Emma Thompson received acclaim for her portrayal of P.L. Travers Saving Mr. Banks received positive reviews from film critics, with major praise directed to the acting; particularly Thompson, Hanks, and Farrell's performances. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 260 reviews, with an average rating of 7.00/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Aggressively likable and sentimental to a fault, Saving Mr. Banks pays tribute to the Disney legacy with excellent performances and sweet, high-spirited charm.\\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Leslie Felprin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film as an \\"affecting if somewhat soft-soaped comedy drama, elevated by excellent performances.\\" The Reporter wrote that \\"Emma Thompson takes charge of the central role of P. L. Travers with an authority that makes you wonder how anybody else could ever have been considered.\\" Scott Foundas of Variety wrote that the film \\"has all the makings of an irresistible backstage tale, and it's been brought to the screen with a surplus of old-fashioned Disney showmanship ...\\", and that Tom Hanks's portrayal captured Walt Disney's \\"folksy charisma and canny powers of persuasion ‚Äî at once father, confessor and the shrewdest of businessmen.\\" Overall, he praised the film as \\"very rich in its sense of creative people and their spirit of self-reinvention.\\" The Washington Post's Ann Hornaday rated the film three out of four stars, writing: \\"Saving Mr. Banks doesn't always straddle its stories and time periods with the utmost grace. But the film ‚Äî which John Lee Hancock directed from a script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith ‚Äî more than makes up for its occasionally unwieldy structure in telling a fascinating and ultimately deeply affecting story, along the way giving viewers tantalizing glimpses of the beloved 1964 movie musical, in both its creation and final form.\\" The New York Times' A. O. Scott gave a positive review, declaring the film as \\"an embellished, tidied-up but nonetheless reasonably authentic glimpse of the Disney entertainment machine at work.\\" Mark Kermode writing for The Observer awarded the film four out of five stars, lauding Thompson's performance as \\"impeccable\\", elaborating that \\"Thompson dances her way through Travers' conflicting emotions, giving us a fully rounded portrait of a person who is hard to like but impossible not to love.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune felt similarly, writing: \\"Thompson's the show. Each withering put-down, every jaundiced utterance, lands with a little ping.\\" In regard to the screenplay, he wrote that \\"screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith treat everyone gently and with the utmost respect.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three out of four stars and equally commended the performances of the cast. Alonso Duralde of TheWrap described the film as a \\"whimsical, moving and occasionally insightful tale ... director John Lee Hancock luxuriates in the period detail of early-'60s Disney-ana\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B+\\" grade, explaining that \\"the trick here is how perfectly Thompson and Hanks portray the gradual thaw in their characters' frosty alliance, empathizing with each other's equally miserable upbringings in a beautiful three-hankie scene late in the film.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"does not strictly hew to the historical record where the eventual resolution of this conflict is concerned,\\" but admitted that it \\"is easy to accept this fictionalizing as part of the price to be paid for Thompson's engaging performance.\\" David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph described the confrontational interaction between Thompson and Hanks as \\"terrific\\", singling out Thompson's \\"bravura performance\\", and calling the film itself \\"smart, witty entertainment\\". Kate Muir of The Times spoke highly of Thompson and Hanks's performances. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal, however, considered Colin Farrell to be the film's \\"standout performance\\". IndieWire's Ashley Clark wrote that the film \\"is witty, well-crafted and well-performed mainstream entertainment which, perhaps unavoidably, cleaves to a well-worn Disney template stating that all problems‚Äîhowever psychologically deep-rooted‚Äîcan be overcome.\\" Another staff writer labeled Thompson's performance as her best since Sense and Sensibility, and stated that \\"she makes the Australian-born British transplant a curmudgeonly delight.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian enjoyed Hanks' role as Disney, suggesting that, despite its brevity, the film would have been largely \\"bland\\" without it. The film did receive some criticism. Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent gave the film a mixed review, writing: \\"On the one hand, Saving Mr. Banks (which was developed by BBC Films and has a British producer) is a probing, insightful character study with a very dark undertow. On the other, it is a cheery, upbeat marketing exercise in which the Disney organization is re-promoting one of its most popular film characters.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concluded that if the film \\"\\"were 100 percent false and yet felt true, that would be fine. But this has the self-conscious whiff, if not of mendacity, then of public relations.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post criticized the accuracy of the film's events, concluding that \\"Saving Mr. Banks is ultimately much less about magic than making the sale, in more ways than one.\\" American history lecturer John Wills praised the film's attention to detail, such as the inclusion of Travers' original recordings, but doubted that the interpersonal relations between Travers and Disney were as amicable as portrayed in the film. Landon Palmer of Film School Rejects also described several moments where the film had a \\"shrewd consumption of [the company's] own criticisms\\", only to later negate them and Disney-fy Travers as a character. =Accolades= Saving Mr. Banks was nominated for several awards and earned accolades from various organizations, critics' groups and circles, particularly in recognition of Emma Thompson. The film received five nominations at the 67th British Academy Film Awards, including Best British Film, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer, Best Film Music, and Best Costume Design. The film received a Best Original Score nomination at the 86th Academy Awards, where, despite not earning a nomination, the film was widely considered by pundits to be a front-runner for Best Picture and Best Actress. The film also received single nominations at the 71st Golden Globe Awards and 20th Screen Actors Guild Awards, where Thompson was nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, respectively. Additionally, Thompson won both the Empire Award for Best Actress and the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress for her performance, while the film itself was selected by the National Board of Review as one of the year's top 10 films. Saving Mr. Banks was named by the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of 2013.

Albright is a physicist and weapons scientist known for his work with the U.S. Government, think tanks and National Laboratories, and government contractors. Since November 1, 2014, he has been the president and CEO of HRL Laboratories,http://hrl.com/hrlDocs/pressreleases/2014/prsRls_141017.html a research firm jointly owned by Boeing and General Motors. Until December 2013 he served as the director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and, in 2014, he served as a senior advisor in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Education Albright received his bachelor's degree in physics from the George Washington University, and his master's and doctorate in physics from the University of Maryland. After receiving his doctorate, he held a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship position at the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute for Science and Technology). Career =Private sector= From 1986 until 1999, Albright worked at the federally funded Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). While there, Albright became an internationally recognized expert on ballistic and cruise missile defense systems; space based infrared and launch detection systems; and weapons and sensor system design and analysis. He has served on a number of prominent national-level panels related to missile defense, including the \\"Welch\\" Panels on National Missile Defense, the Congressionally- mandated reviews of the Patriot PAC-3 system, and the panel on risk reduction for the Navy Area Defense System. For several years he led study efforts for DoD in ballistic and cruise missile defense, including technical and performance analyses of space-based and airborne laser programs; sea-based ballistic missile defense concepts; boost-phase intercept systems; and national missile defense concepts. He served as technical lead for the joint US-Israeli Short Range Rocket Defense study He led the study for the Deputy Secretary of Defense that assessed solutions to the MLRS threat in Korea. He was the technical lead for the Theater Air and Missile Defense Modernization panel of the first Quadrennial Defense Review. Albright initiated and led the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense study for OSD and the Joint Staff. Albright served on several national panels in the area of ballistic missile launch detection systems, including the so-called Everett Panel on space based infrared satelliteshttp://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/fews.htm and the Space-based Infrared Architecture Study. Albright led studies associated with intelligence collection systems, such as hyperspectral sensors for surveillance, and automatic target recognition systems. He was asked by ASD(C3I) to assess future imagery requirements, and their impact on the mix between space-based and airborne collection capabilities. In addition, his analytical skills led to assignment in areas outside of his primary interests. For example, he served on the national panel that reviewed the nerve gas transport modeling of the Khamisiyah release event in Iraq.http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/khamisiyah_tech/kham_tech_s05.htm He also led the analytic team supporting the 1999 Defense Science Board Summer Study, with a focus on the very rapid deployment of ground combat forces and their sustainment. Albright has designed and executed several experiments, including one carried out by the crew of the Space Shuttle (STS 39).STS-39 Beginning in 1999, and until he was asked to serve in the White House after the events of September 11, 2001, Albright worked in the Advanced Technology Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) where he developed and managed programs associated with special operations, intelligence collection, molecular biology, communications, and maritime operations. =Government service= Between January 2002, and the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, Albright concurrently held the positions of senior director for research and development in the Office of Homeland Security and assistant director for homeland and national security within the Office of Science and Technology Policy. He was the lead official within the White House responsible for providing advice to the Executive Office of the President on science and technology issues surrounding homeland security, and on the threat of biological, nuclear, and chemical terrorism. He served as lead author for those portions of the President‚Äôs National Strategy for Homeland Security dealing with catastrophic threats and science and technology. In July 2002, Albright was asked to lead the planning for the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Directorate of the proposed Department of Homeland Security; this later evolved into the Science and Technology Directorate. In this latter capacity Albright conceptualized the policies and procedures for the new Directorate, including a rigorous planning, programming and budgeting process. He guided the development of its initial programmatic activities; developed the budget; developed the organizational concept; and conducted the initial staffing. Throughout this period Albright was responsible for working with Congress and other departments to achieve the Bush Administration's vision for the new department. In October 2003, Albright was confirmed by the Senate as Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security in the Department of Homeland Security and served in this position until July 2005. His responsibilities included developing the multi-year strategic planning guidance and budget execution for the complete portfolio of programs comprising the Science and Technology Directorate. Albright served as principal scientific advisor to the Secretary of Homeland Security on issues associated with science, technology, and the threat of biological, nuclear, and chemical terrorism. On these issues he served as the Department‚Äôs primary representative to other US Government agencies, the Homeland Security Council, the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and foreign governments. As the policy lead for the Department‚Äôs research, development, test and evaluation activities, Albright oversaw associated intra-Departmental relationships. He served as the principal policy point of contact for the Directorate with the business community, external science and technology professional organizations and societies, private sector interest groups, and with non-federal government agencies on issues of science and technology policy. He oversaw the development of the regulations implementing the SAFETY Act, along with the associated processes and infrastructure, and was responsible for implementing the Department‚Äôs SAFETY Act policies.https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/palbright- bio.html =Return to private sector= From August 2005 to November 2009, he served as president of Civitas Group LLC. While at Civitas, Albright led the analytic team in support of the first Quadrennial Homeland Security Review.http://csis.org/publication/first-quadrennial-homeland-security-review In addition, he led the development and publication of a comprehensive Biodefense Net Assessment under DHS sponsorship. Due to Civitas‚Äôs special relationship with a venture capital firm, Albright served on their investment review board. From December 2009 to November 2011, he served as principal associate director for global security at LLNL. While leading the Global Security DIrectorate, Albright emphasized developing and implementing strategies aimed at reducing the barriers faced in deploying Laboratory capabilities outside the traditional NNSA nuclear weapons sponsor.http://nnsa.energy.gov/ In December 2011 Albright became the 11th director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu welcomed Albright's appointment, saying, \\"As we work to accomplish the Department‚Äôs unique national security missions and make the critical investments required for the future of American innovation. I know we have an outstanding partner in Dr. Albright.\\"http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/pulse-of- the-bay/new-leadership-appointed-lawrence/ Under Albright's leadership a number of internal reforms were implemented. Many of these were associated with improved lab-wide planning, budgeting, and communications. Of particular significance were the changes that Albright implemented at the National Ignition Facility in its governance, and in broadening the scientific approaches and talent applied to achieving the goal of ignition after the end of the National Ignition Campaign. He also initiated the planning for conducting experiments at NIF with plutonium. He was instrumental in formulating and then implementing a strategy for the National Ignition FacilityNational Ignition Facility that re-emphasized its role in stockpile stewardship. These changes at NIF resulted in much improved relationships with the Department of Energy, the NIF user community, and also resulted in significant advances in ignition science. While at LLNL, Albright argued for science investments in support of stockpile stewardship, and as an advocate for an expanded role in national security for the NNSA Laboratories, Albright worked with the senior leadership in DoD, DHS, and the Intelligence Community (IC) to successfully bring the Laboratory‚Äôs capabilities to important national security missions. He was the first Director of a National Laboratory to visit and meet with the leadership of the IAEA, as well as the combatant commanders at PACOM, SOCOM, SOUTHCOM, CENTCOM, and NORTHCOM. After stepping down from the director's position at LLNL, he returned to Washington, D.C., and, under loan from LLNL, served as a senior advisor to the director of IARPA and also to the Director of National Intelligence, where he conducted several studies of national significance. Since November 1, 2014, he has been the president and CEO of HRL Laboratories,http://hrl.com/hrlDocs/pressreleases/2014/prsRls_141017.html a research firm jointly owned by Boeing and General Motors.

The company tours year round while sustaining a calendar year ‚Äòseason‚Äô of local premiers and commercial work as well as a spring/fall educational outreach program. The company has received widespread critical acclaim while being considered one of the most notable American dance companies to emerge during the first decade of the 2000s. Established in 2002, the organization has commissioned well over 100 original works from choreographers including Harrison McEldowney, James Morrow, Davis Robertson, Amirah Sackett and Nicholas Leichter. Crash is led by artistic director Jessica Deahr, executive director Mark Hackman and is a resident company of Visceral Dance Center in Chicago, IL.Visceral Dance Center official website History Chicago Dance Crash was founded by Illinois State University graduates Marissa Moritz, Charlie Cutler and Mark Hackman as a professional outlet for works the trio had created as students. Admittedly to satisfy the individual talents of the three (Cutler an actor, Hackman a martial artist and Moritz a modern dancer), early productions utilized dance and acrobatics while forwarding a linear, conflict-driven story. The company's first performances took place at the 60-seat, historical Mary-Arrchie Theater in Chicago's Northeast neighborhood of Buena Park. Crash's first production, titled The Mercutio Story, soon after extended to several performances across the city including the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre at Navy Pier and ultimately performing at ‚ÄúThe Space‚Äù storefront theater in New York City.\\"History of Crash: 2001-2015\\" staff interviews Crash incorporated on December 23, 2003, employed its first artistic director in 2003 and established its current local season structure in 2005.

Style and notoriety =Fusion- style= thumb Chicago Dance Crash performing \\"The Bricklayers of Oz\\" The prevailing aesthetic of Chicago Dance Crash has been cited as \\"fusion-style,\\" generally referred to as the blending of unalike dance forms but more culturally recognized as the specific combination of hip hop dance aspects (including breakdancing, popping, krump, among others) with the influence of \\"concert dance\\" vocabulary and direction (modern dance, jazz dance, ballet). The term \\"fusion-style\\" was originally coined by Chicago-raised dancer and choreographer James Morrow whose company \\"Instruments of Movement\\" championed the style regionally from 2001‚Äì2009.\\"Hip Hop Fusion with James Morrow\\" The Academy of Music and Movement As two of Crash's founders (Moritz and Hackman) as well as all three of Crash's artistic directors had previously danced under Morrow, it's been publicly stated that Crash's aesthetic is attributed to his work. =Movement plays= Although not historically an unknown concept to live dance performance, Crash gained early support among critics and fans due largely to their creation of evening-length, linear plot-based works which they dubbed \\"movement plays\\"... a format less utilized in Chicago during the turn of the millennium. A device still used by the organization today, the shows often complement larger-spanning concepts with popular culture fa√ßades; commenting on morality, religion and politics with comic book settings, video game references and onstage spectacles. =KTF= Second to the Neo-Futurists show Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind, Chicago Dance Crash locally operates the longest-running live show in the history of Chicago. Opening on March 9, 2007 at the Lakeshore Theater, the company premiered an interactive dance battle titled The Keeper of The Floor (KTF for short) with dancers of differing styles competing in comical rounds towards a single champion of the night. Now performing at The Den Theater in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood, the show's original late-night host was Reggie Watts and has been headlined by host Matthew Hollis, nicknamed \\"Mattrick Swayze,\\" since 2008.\\"The KTF Experience\\" Youtube documentary Company dancer Kristi Licera competing in \\"KTF\\" Critical reception and awards Chicago Dance Crash was named ‚ÄúBest Dance Company‚Äù of 2009 by the Chicago Reader, \\"Best in Dance\\" for 2012 from the Chicago Tribune and was recognized by Newcity as the best new dance company to emerge between 2000‚Äì2010 in their ‚ÄúDecade of Dance‚Äù publication. *AT&T; Onstage Award, 2005 *The Katherine Dunham Award for Choreography, 2006btaawards.org *The Alvin Ailey Award, 2006 *Black Theater Alliance Awards, 2008 *\\"Best Dance Company of the Year\\" Chicago Reader, 2009 *\\"Outstanding Choreographer\\" Dance Chicago 2010 *Chicago Dance New Voice Award, 2011Dance Chicago Choreography Awards *\\"Best in Dance\\" Chicago Tribune 2012 *Show of the Year, Breakdance Chicago, 2013 *CTT Inspiration Award, 2016 *\\"Most Inventive New Work\\" in the United States, Dance Magazine 2017 The company has received additional honors from Americans for the Arts, Dance for Life, the Illinois Arts Council, DCASE, The National Endowment for the Arts, the World Wildlife Fund, Uniqlo and JPMorgan Chase among others.

He also rode in Australia, South Africa, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Early life and family Born in the Greymouth suburb of Cobden on 4 September 1931, Skelton was the son of William George Skelton and Gwendoline Emma Skelton (n√©e Baker). In 1955 he married Italian-born Emanuela Valeria Macchi, and they went on to have three children, including David, who was a jockey in both Australia and New Zealand. Bill Skelton's brother, Bob, was also a successful jockey as were his other brothers, Frank, Max, and Errol, although the latter was more noted as a top trainer for many years. Racing career Skelton started as an apprentice jockey aged 13, and rode his first winner (a dead heat) aged 15 at Wingatui. He was the leading apprentice in New Zealand for four consecutive years, and champion jockey seven times, and was outside the top four of the premiership between 1947 and 1979 only four times. He rode a record 124 winners in the 1967‚Äì68 season, and in May 1980 became the first New Zealand jockey to ride 2000 winners; he finished with 2179. He remains the most successful jockey of the 20th century in New Zealand with those figures. According to Skelton, the best horse he rode was Daryl's Joy, champion New Zealand two-year-old in 1968, champion three-year-old in Australia in 1969, and later successful in the United States. Skelton won both the W.S. Cox Plate and the Victoria Derby on Daryl's Joy in Australia. The big two-mile victories in New Zealand included the Auckland Cup on Lucky Son, which he also trained; his father-in-law Fred Pratt's mare Foglia D'Oro in the New Zealand Cup; and Loofah and Noir Filou in the Wellington Cup. Honours and awards In the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours, Skelton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to horse racing as a jockey. He was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, and to the New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame in 2006. Later life and death Skelton suffered a stroke in 1994, which restricted his movement and speech. He died in Palmerston North on 25 November 2016, aged 85.

It is located on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. The axis of the valley runs almost directly north to south. Kawuneeche means \\"valley of the coyote\\" in Arapaho language and there is a Coyote Valley Trail head by US Route 34 in the western half of the park. Coyotes still live here, as do wapiti (elk), mule deer, moose (reintroduced in 1978 into nearby North Park), and mountain lion. Along the main part of valley runs the lower section of the Trail Ridge Road - the highest continuous paved road in the United States.  Wilderness  Rocky Mountain elk in Kawuneeche Valley at dawn The construction of a water diversion canal called Grand Ditch between the 1890s and 1930s reduced the water table and limited the frequency and magnitude of the floods in the Kawuneeche Valley. Grand Ditch collects water from Colorado River‚Äôs tributaries in the Never Summer Mountains like a rain gutter from the roof and diverts it on the other side of the Continental Divide to the Cache La Poudre River via La Poudre Pass, instead of allowing it to flow down to the valley. In addition, Grand Ditch breached its bank on May 30, 2003 and a resulting debris flow caused extensive injury to the upper Kawuneeche Valley. The Grand Ditch owner - the Water Supply and Storage Company (WSSC) was ordered to pay $9 million settlement to the Rocky Mountain National Park. It was the largest natural resource damages payment in the history of the Park System Resource Protection Act. Grand Ditch exerts also negative aesthetic impact on the Kawuneeche. Elk (wapiti, Cervus canadensis) were reintroduced to their former habitat in the Colorado River Valley in the mid-1910s. Moose (Alces alces) was reintroduced by the Colorado Division of Wildlife in the 1970s in North Park, which is just to the northwest of Rocky Mountain National Park, however, significant breeding populations may never have inhabited Colorado. This solitary species wanders alone moving south from Wyoming or east from Utah. And such moose probably account for sightings and kills in Colorado between the 1860s and 1960s. This is an ecological innovation driven largely by state game officials to attract sportsmen and tourists. However, moose are known to undergo dramatic population cycles, which, in combination with European settlement, could account for their scarcity in Colorado before 1978. Populations were known in southern Wyoming's Medicine Bow Mountains. Colorado River at the Coyote Valley trailhead In 1978 and 1979, 4 bulls, 13 cows, 4 yearlings, and 3 calves were transferred from the Uinta Mountains (Utah) and Grand Teton (Wyoming) to an area near Rand, west of the Never Summer Mountains (Kawuneeche Valley is located just on the east side of this range). All radio collared, 12 each year. And today Kawuneeche Valley is a prime moose habitat, although sightings frequently occur even further, east of the Continental Divide, and even south to the upper Rio Grande valley. Large herbivores have become so numerous in the Kawuneeche Valley, that they cause significant harm to the willow (Salix spp.) thickets and other plants, on which many other organisms depend. Elk is overpopulated, but rarer moose more specialized - 91.3% of its summer diets consist of six willow species. This is accompanied by drought (caused by water diversion by Grand Ditch, lack of beavers, global climatic patterns) and the proliferation of a native fungus spread by a bird called the sapsucker (Sphyrapicus spp.). The primary fungus species is Grosmannia clavigera, but Ophiostoma is also present. The fungi kill the stems above the wells drilled by sapsuckers. All these factors weaken the ability of the valley‚Äôs willows to generate new growth, their communities have declined, only few willow plants on the primary winter range produce seed. As a result, fully dependent on twigs and bark on willow stems North American beaver (Castor canadensis), actually living in symbiosis with willow, substantially recovered from fur- trapping by the mid-twentieth century, declined the Kawuneeche. The most important bark beetle species in the Kawuneeche Valley are mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis). In recent years, these species have devastated forests on the western side of Rocky Mountain National Park. Thanks to the ecologists and fisheries scientists the native Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus) is coming back, but introduced brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) continue to compete with the Kawuneeche‚Äôs native fish. The Grand Ditch enabled fish to swim between the two basins and to mix previously isolated gene pools of two native trout subspecies ‚Äî greenback cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias) from the eastern slope of the Rockies, and Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus) from the west.  Historical places  There are a few historical places located in the valley or its vicinity, like: * Trail Ridge Road (U.S. National Register of Historic Places reference #84000242, added to NRHP November 14, 1984 ) * Grand Ditch, mentioned earlier water diversion canal in the Never Summer Mountains (NRHP reference #84000242, added September 29, 1976 ) * Lulu City (NRHP reference #77001562, added September 14, 1977 ) and Gaskil - sites of the mining camps from the 1880s.

Early life and education Trey Radel was born in 1976 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Kathleen (Sollinger) and Henry Jude Radel, Jr. He attended Elder High School. Radel majored in communications and minored in Italian at Loyola University Chicago. Radel is also fluent in Spanish. Media career Radel began his career as a journalist, working as both an anchor and a reporter. He interned for CNN at its headquarters in Atlanta. He then worked for CBS affiliates KHOU in Houston, WBBM in Chicago, and WINK-TV in Fort Myers, Florida. In 2005, Radel bought the Naples Journal, a community newspaper that he later sold to the E.W. Scripps Company, the owner of Naples Daily News. In 2007, after selling the Journal, Radel returned to WINK. He remained at the station until in 2009, when he left to host a live, 4-hour long morning radio show on WFSX-FM 92.5 Fox News Radio. Radel would return to the station in September 2016 to host mornings. A year later, he moved to afternoon drive time, the time slot he hosts today.  Author  On March 28, 2017, Blue Rider Press, an imprint of the Random House company, released Radel‚Äôs book, Democrazy, a True Story of Weird Politics, Money, Madness, and Finger Food. The book was reviewed by HuffPost as \\"a brutally honest, outrageous memoir\\" which exposes \\"how the Washington sausage really gets made.‚Äù Along with former New York Governor George Pataki, Radel co-authored Beyond the Great Divide: How a Nation Became a Neighborhood. The book was published by Post Hill Press and described as, ‚ÄúAn unprecedented, insider view into 9/11 and the inner workings of the political climate that emerged after the attacks.‚Äù  Acting career  Radel was trained as an actor and a comedian and performed improvisational work at Second City in Chicago. In 2016, Radel started what would become a recurring role as a TV news anchor on the show StartUp on the Sony owned App Crackle'. He also played the lead, starring as a detective, in the series Truth is Stranger than Florida on the Investigation Discovery network.  Nonprofit work  Radel, along with his wife, founded a nonprofit organization called the U.S. Forces Fund, which focuses on helping injured soldiers returning home from abroad.  U.S. House of Representatives  Radel represented Florida's 19th congressional district from January 3, 2013 through January 27, 2014, sworn into the 113th United States Congress. The district is located in Southwest Florida and includes Fort Myers, Naples and Cape Coral. Republican 14th District Congressman Connie Mack IV decided not to run for reelection to his seat, in order to challenge Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson. Radel decided to run in the open seat, which had been renumbered as the 19th District. Five other Republican candidates also filed to run. Controversy occurred when it was discovered that the campaign committee \\"Friends of Trey Radel, Inc.\\" had purchased his opponents' domain names nearly a year before he announced he was going to run for office. When this was revealed, his campaign committee created websites and attached them to his opponents' domain names, purportedly for the purpose of disseminating the voting records of the opponents, which were posted on the websites. Radel's political philosophy is conservative, but he nevertheless has said he supports the principles of the DREAM Act. Radel was endorsed by the incumbent Connie Mack IV, former U.S. Senator Connie Mack III, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Chauncey Goss (who finished second to Radel in the primary) was endorsed by U.S. Congressman Paul Ryan. Radel won the primary with 30% of the vote, primarily on the strength of his showing in his native Lee County. His primary campaign featured a \\"Tea Party-tinged\\" message.Cocaine and the Congressman: The Trey Radel you didn't know, Naples Daily News (November 23, 2013). In the general election Radel faced Democrat Jim Roach of Cape Coral, a retired GM research engineer and Vietnam veteran. Radel was heavily favored to win because 19th has long been reckoned as one of the most Republican districts in Florida. Radel won the 2012 election with 63% of the vote.

Less than a month later, Radel pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of possession of cocaine and was sentenced to one year of supervised probation. Following his conviction for cocaine possession, Radel went on a self-imposed leave of absence to undergo addiction rehabilitation, announcing that he would be donating his salary to charity during his absence. Radel stopped short of resigning. The Republican Party of Florida and Governor Rick Scott called for his resignation. On January 27, 2014, Radel announced he would resign from Congress. He had not voted in Congress after November 15, 2013 in the wake of the conviction. In late January 2014, Radel officially tendered his resignation in a letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner. Republican businessman Curt Clawson won the special general election held on June 24, 2014 to replace him. Radel completed all conditions of his probation in October 2014, and he successfully petitioned the court to expunge his criminal record. Personal life Radel is married to FOX-4 anchor Amy Wegmann.

He was the father of actress Nancy Walker, known earlier in life as \\"Nan Barto\\". Early career Dewey Barto was baptized on March 28, 1897, with the name Steward Stephen Swoyer, according to Pennsylvania's Church and Town Records, 1708-1985, in Reading, Pennsylvania, one of the eight children born to Elizabeth and Charles \\"Roxie\\" Swoyer, an acrobat, who owned a horse and wagon circus.. Barto later adjusted his name to Stewart Steven Swoyer, as per his WWII draft records. Dewey came from a family of performers. His sisters Estelle and Ida were trapeze artists and contortionists, first as the Miaco Sisters and later as the Delno Sisters. His brother Charles played drums with several well-known bands. By the age of 16, Dewey was the youngest trader on the Curb Market on Wall Street. He gained popularity as a dancer in Liberty bond drives, and when his company collapsed during a financial depression, Dewey joined The Three Bartos acrobatic team. He initially used the name Dewey Swoyer, but later changed his name to Dewey Barto, a name he used for the rest of his life. On July 4, 1919, in Manhattan, Barto married Philadelphia-born vaudeville performer and dancer Myrtle Flemming Lawler (born 1898 ‚Äì died 1931), half of the Grazer and Lawler song and dance act. Their elder daughter, Anna Myrtle Swoyer, was born in Philadelphia on May 10, 1922. She later changed her name to Nancy Walker, becoming an actress and comedian of stage, screen, and television. She died in 1992, aged 69. Her younger sister, Betty Lou Swoyer, was born in 1930, almost five months before the sudden death of their mother. Betty Lou had a relatively brief performing career. It is unclear if Betty Lou Barto is still alive. Some sources cite her death in 2012, but that has not been confirmed. Not long after his younger daughter's birth, Dewey Barto was performing in an acrobatic act billed as Barto and Melvin. He began dancing solo in 1924 as \\"The Hectic Hoofer\\" and continued performing as a single with Fanchon and Marco enterprises in 1925. Barto and Mann While performing as a single with Fanchon and Marco in early 1926, Barto (4'11\\", the same height as his elder daughter) was paired with George Mann (6'6\\"). Together, they began to develop comedic dance and acrobatic material based on the disparity in their heights that was well received by audiences up and down the West Coast. At the end of 1926, they signed a ten-year contract with Fanchon and Marcho that linked them together as Barto and Mann for over 15 years. William Morris of the William Morris Agency booked them \\"cold\\" into the Palace Theatre on March 14, 1927, where they were a great success. With offers from all the major vaudeville circuits, they chose to sign with the Orpheum Circuit. Several months later they had switched to the Keith-Albee Circuit with whom they toured across the U.S. until they signed with Earl Carroll's Vanities from August 1928 to February 1929. Myrtle Lawler Barto died suddenly on January 2, 1931. Following a break to recover from his wife's death, Barto rejoined Mann and continued touring the U.S. and Canada, with European tours in the summers of 1931-34. As vaudeville faded, Barto and Mann joined the Broadway cast of Olsen and Johnson's Hellzapoppin, with featured billing from 1938 until 1942. The team split up in December 1943. From late 1944 to early 1948, Dewey Barto appeared on stage with another partner as Barto & Stan. American Guild of Variety Artists In the early 1920s, Barto joined the National Vaudeville Artists, E.F. Albee's company union formed to counter the White Rats. In early August 1940, Barto was named president of the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA), succeeding Jay Flippen who had resigned earlier. Barto resigned as president of the AGVA in February 1941, which led to the Associated Actors and Artistes of America (4As) assuming operational control of AGVA. Barto was again elected to the board of the AGVA to represent the New York local in May 1941. When AGVA achieved independence from the Associated Actors and Artistes of America in November 1948, Barto was unanimously drafted by AGVA's national board to become its National Administrative Secretary. He announced his intention to resign the position in November 1949. Death Barto died in Beverly Hills, California on January 31, 1973, aged 76.

It is owned by a publicly held holding company, People's Utah Bancorp, which is traded on NASDAQ as PUB. It is the second-largest bank headquartered in Utah, and has 26 branches serving businesses and individuals in the area from Preston, Idaho to St. George, Utah. The current bank was formed from mergers of separate institutions including Bank of American Fork, Lewiston State Bank, and People's State Bank of American Fork These themselves had grown by opening new branches and by acquisitions, including, in the case of Bank of American Fork, by its acquisition of branches from Banner Bank. Description historic headquarters building in American Fork, December 2010 The bank is headquartered in American Fork, but serves the Wasatch Front, the Cache Valley, and St. George with 26 locations, from St. George to Preston, Idaho. As of 2018, the bank employed about 520 people. Originally called The People's State Bank of American Fork, it officially changed its name to Bank of American Fork in the 1960s. Decades later, the bank purchased and restored a historical building constructed in 1911 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The historic building initially housed the original Bank of American Fork that closed after the 1929 stock market crash. (The bank's historic headquarters building is significant as the only surviving bank building and the \\"most visually impressive\\" of four surviving intact historic commercial buildings on Main Street in American Fork.) and History =Early Years= Bank of American Fork was established in 1913 as The People's State Bank of American Fork. In its early years, the bank found modest success servicing mostly sheep farmers in Utah County. Key to the bank's success was the leadership of Clifford E. Young, the Bank's manager from 1913 until the mid 1950s. After the stock market crash of 1929, the Bank survived with the help of Young and other shareholders who sold and mortgaged their personal property. In early 1932, Young decided to temporarily close People's State Bank instead of risking a run on the bank, as had happened to many banks across the country. The bank re-opened later that year. Orville Gunther, a local businessman, had been serving on the Bank's board of directors for several years when, in the early 1960s, he purchased a controlling interest in the bank. Soon after, Gunther shortened the name of the bank by dropping \\"People's State\\" so that it became known as \\"Bank of American Fork.\\" =1970s - 2000s= Expansion within Utah began in the 1970s when the Bank's second branch was built in Alpine. The 1990s saw full-service branches constructed in Highland, Orem, Lehi, Pleasant Grove, and Spanish Fork. With the new century came new branches in the Salt Lake Valley, including locations in Draper, Sandy, Murray, and Riverton. Later, a Saratoga Springs branch opened in Utah Valley and a Layton branch opened in Davis County, bringing the total number of Bank of American Fork branches to 13. In 2014, Bank of American Fork opened a full-service branch in St. George. As of August 2017, Bank of American Fork had 15 branches. The bank's holding company is People's Utah Bancorp. Bank of American Fork branch in southeastern Orem, March 2017 =2013 - 2019= In 2013, Bank of American Fork merged with Lewiston State Bank of Logan, Utah. (Lewiston State Bank was founded in Lewiston, Utah in 1905.) In 2015, Bank of American Fork and Lewiston State Bank merged their banking charters into one, with the existing charter named People's Intermountain Bank. As divisions of People's Intermountain Bank, Bank of American Fork and Lewiston State Bank continue operating under their traditional names and branding. In June 2017, People's Intermountain Bank announced its intention to purchase Town & Country Bank of St. George. Following regulatory approval and the closing of the transaction, the Bank of American Fork St. George branch was consolidated with the Town & Country Bank St. George location, with the surviving entity operating as People's Town & Country Bank, a division of People's Intermountain Bank. On July 27, 2017, People's Intermountain Bank announced its intention to acquire Banner Bank's Utah branches. The transaction was completed on October 6, 2017, and the five surviving Banner Bank branches began operating under the name Bank of American Fork on October 9, 2017, bringing the total number of Bank of American Fork branches to 20, and the total number of branches in the People's Intermountain Bank family to 25. =2019 - present= On November 13, 2019 the People's Intermountain Bank and its divisions (Bank of American Fork, Lewiston State Bank, and People's Town & Country Bank) rebranded itself as Altabank.

The name has been interpreted as meaning \\"narrow\\", but Rudolf Simek suggests that the association with Hel and the use of the same name for N√≥tt's father indicate that Narfi may have \\"originally [been] a demon of the dead\\" and that his name could be related to the Old Norse word n√°r, \\"corpse\\", which gave rise to N√°str√∂nd and Naglfar.

Blogging  When she began to blog, T·∫° Phong T·∫ßn worked as a policewoman. In 2004, she became a freelance journalist. Two years later, she started a blog titled Cong Ly va Su That (\\"Justice and Truth\\"), which became popular for its reports on police abuses. Because of these reports and the criticism on the web about the policies of the Communist Party of Vietnam, she was expelled from the Party and lost her job in 2006. T·∫° Phong T·∫ßn was arrested in September 2011. She, along with fellow dissident bloggers Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn H·∫£i and Phan Thanh H·∫£i, had posted through the \\"Free Vietnamese Journalists' Club\\". The three were charged with writing anti-state propaganda. The charges carried a maximum sentence of twenty years' imprisonment. The Economist described the arrests as \\"the latest in a series of attempts by Vietnam's communist rulers to rein in the country's blossoming internet population.\\" The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights criticized the arrests, stating its concern for \\"what appears to be increasingly limited space for freedom of expression in Viet Nam\\". In a July 2012 visit to Hanoi, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concern for the detention of the three members of the Free Vietnamese Journalists' Club. Amnesty International described the three as prisoners of conscience and urged their release. The International Federation for Human Rights and World Organisation Against Torture also released a joint statement calling on the Vietnamese government to release the three bloggers unconditionally.  Mother's self-immolation  On the morning of 30 July 2012, T·∫° Phong T·∫ßn's 64-year-old mother, Dang Thi Kim Lieng, set herself on fire outside the Bac Lieu People's Committee in protest of her daughter's detention, one week before Tan's trial was set to begin. Lieng died of her burns en route to the hospital. The death was the first reported self- immolation in Vietnam since the 1970s. Vietnamese state media did not acknowledge the death for several days before stating that it would investigated. An indefinite postponement was announced in Tan's trial. The US Embassy in Vietnam stated that it was \\"concerned and saddened\\" by the news, and reiterated its calls for the bloggers' release. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists called Lieng's death \\"a shocking reminder that Vietnam's campaign against bloggers and journalists exacts an unbearable emotional toll on the individuals involved.\\" Human Rights Watch called on the international community to address the underlying human rights situation, stating, \\"This is not just a tragedy for one family. This is a tragedy for the whole country.\\" A large number of mourners journeyed to Lieng's home to pay respects in the week following her death, though many were reportedly intercepted on the roads by state security forces. The government also placed Lieng's mourners under surveillance by plainclothes police officers.  Sentence  On 24 September 2012, T·∫° Phong T·∫ßn was sentenced to ten years in prison in a one-day hearing that The Economist compared to a Soviet Union show trial. Prosecutors stated that the three had \\"distorted the truth about State and Party, created anxiety among citizens and supported schemes to overthrow the government\\", and the court found that they were \\"seriously affecting national security and the image of the country in the global arena.\\" Phan Thanh Hai, who had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, and Nguyen Van Hai to twelve years. The sentences were upheld by an appeals court on 28 December 2012. In 2013, the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found Tan's detention to violate several articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

In 2013, she was named a winner of the International Women of Courage Award of the US State Department. In the ceremony on International Women's Day, US Secretary of State John Kerry said of her, \\"For her dedication to continually demanding a better government for her people, for her willingness to take risks for her beliefs, and for her life experience and skills as a writer that serve as an inspiration to women in Vietnam, T·∫° Phong T·∫ßn is a 2013 woman of courage.\\"  Personal life  Her conversion to catholicism began due to a case where she defended 8 Thai parishioners, after that case she began to get involved with the parish and the Catholics, being baptized in July 18, 2009 with the Christian name of Maria.

It was built between 1881 and 1884 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Li√®ge. Attacked in both World War I and World War II, the fort has been preserved as a refuge for bats, which may be visited during summer months. Description The Fort de Pontisse is located about northeast of the center of Li√®ge. Fl√©malle overlooks the Meuse valley and the Albert Canal downstream from Li√®ge. The fort was built as an irregular trapezoid. A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. The fort is one of the larger Li√®ge forts. With the exception of the Fort de Loncin, the Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Li√®ge), with lesser protection than the two \\"salient\\" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear.Donnell, p. 36 The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21 cm.Donnell, p. 52 The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used .Donnell, p. 12 Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21 cm weapons and could not withstand heavier artillery.Donnell, pp. 45-48 Armament Pontisse's armament included two turrets with a single 21 cm Krupp gun, a 15 cm turret with twin guns and two 12 cm turrets with two Krupp guns, all for distant targets. Four 57 mm gun turrets were provided for local defense. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight. Eight rapid-fire 57 mm guns were provided in casemates for the defense of the ditches and the postern. The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with the neighboring Fort de Liers and Fort de Barchon across the river. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.Donnell, p. 17 First World War The Li√®ge forts Li√®ge first came under attack on 6 August 1914. When the Li√®ge's fortifications proved unexpectedly stubborn, the Germans brought heavy siege artillery to bombard the forts with shells far larger than they were designed to resist. Pontisse was the first fort to come under bombardment from 42 cm artillery.Donnell, p. 51 It held out until 13 August 1914, when it surrendered, unable to resist any longer. The Germans improved Pontisse with better sanitary arrangements, ventilation and reinforced concrete in 1916. The Li√®ge forts were reoccupied by the Belgian army in 1918 after the armistice. Fortified Position of Li√®ge Pontisse's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Li√®ge II, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border.Donnell, pp. 55-56 The armament was upgraded with new guns in the turrets and an anti-aircraft battery. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. The 57mm guns were replaced with machine guns. As the most northern fort in PFL IV, it was tasked to support Fort Eben-Emael. A flanking bunker was built to survey the Laveau ravine and to serve as an alternate exit and as a source of ventilation air, in contrast to most of the other Li√®ge forts, which used ventilation towers. Second World War In May 1940 Pontisse was garrisoned by 223 men under the command of Captain-Commandant Fernand Pire. Following the successful German assault on Fort Eben-Emael to the east on May 11, Pontisse provided fire support for Belgian field units for the next few days, including firing on the area around Eben-Emael after Eben-Emael's surrender. Pontisse surrendered in its turn on May 18 following air attack that destroyed the 105mm turret and damaged the 76mm turrets. Pontisse was in any case almost out of ammunition. Present Pontisse was used as an army munitions depot after the war, then by a private munitions firm for the same purpose. It was stripped of its equipment by a salvager in the 1950s. The fort has been unoccupied since 1993. It is maintained as a refuge for bats during the winter months. It may be visited in the summer by arrangement.

His main fields of interest are sexual behavior, relationship dynamics, and religion. Education Regnerus graduated from McBain Rural Agricultural High School in McBain, Michigan, in 1989. He then attended Trinity Christian College, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1993. He then earned his Master of Arts degree in 1997 and his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 2000 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His doctoral dissertation, Adolescent Socialization and Avoiding Trouble: A Perspective on Religious Influences, was written under the direction of Christian Smith, with whom he subsequently co-wrote several articles about religion and social behavior. He then was postdoctoral researcher at the Carolina Population Center before taking a position as Assistant Professor at Calvin College, where he remained until 2002. He accepted a position as Assistant Professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, and advanced to Associate Professor in 2007, and to Full Professor in 2018. Career Earlier in his career, Regnerus studied the influence of religion on adolescent and young-adult behavior. His article \\"Sex is Cheap\\" was the ninth-most downloaded article at Slate in 2011. His books include Premarital Sex in America: How Young Americans Meet, Mate, and Think about Marrying, Forbidden Fruit: Sex and Religion in the Lives of American Teenagers, and Cheap Sex: The Transformation of Men, Marriage, and Monogamy,https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cheap-sex-9780190673611 all published by Oxford University Press. =Same-sex relationships controversy= Regnerus has conducted research on the impact of a child having a parent who has been involved in a same-sex relationship. A 2012 population-based study of his in Social Science ResearchHow different are the adult children of parents who have same-sex relationships? Findings from the New Family Structures Study , Social Science Research, 41: 752-770 concluded that people who had had a parent who had been in a same-gender relationship were at a greater risk of several adverse outcomes, including \\"being on public assistance, being unemployed, and having poorer educational attainment.\\" This generated protracted debate and controversy.Mark Oppenheimer, \\"Sociologist‚Äôs Paper Raises Questions on Role of Faith in Scholarship\\", New York Times, 12 October 2012Brandon Watson, \\"UT Distances from Regnerus\\", The Austin Chronicle, 4 March 2014 This included a disavowal by Regnerus's department chair at the University of Texas-Austin, in which Christine L. Williams cites the American Sociological Association, \\"which takes the position that the conclusions he draws from his study of gay parenting are fundamentally flawed on conceptual and methodological grounds and that findings from Dr. Regnerus‚Äô work have been cited inappropriately in efforts to diminish the civil rights and legitimacy of LBGTQ partners and their families.\\" Two hundred social scientists, led by Gary Gates, signed the \\"Letter to the editors and advisory editors of Social Science Research\\", in which they express their concern \\"about the academic integrity of the peer review process for this paper as well as its intellectual merit.\\" Regnerus continues to defend the research. The controversy also resulted in an audit of the review process used by Social Science Research. Critics have largely focused their attention on the few same-sex relationships in the data, faulting Regnerus for comparing the adult children of intact (heterosexual) families with those whose parents may have purportedly formed same sex relationships after the dissolution of a heterosexual union. In June 2012, 27 scholars signed a defense of Regnerus's research, stating: \\"we think much of the public and academic response to Regnerus is misguided for three reasons.\\" They also argue that \\"it is possible to interpret Regnerus's findings as evidence for the need for legalized gay marriage, in order to support the social stability of such relationships\\", which contrasts with Regnerus's own conclusion published in Slate: \\"[this study] may suggest that the household instability that the NFSS reveals is just too common among same-sex couples to take the social gamble of spending significant political and economic capital to esteem and support this new (but tiny) family form\\". Major academic organizations including the American Sociological Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and American Medical Association dispute the validity of Regnerus's data and conclusions reached thereof, arguing that unlike previous studies, the statistically tiny number of same sex couples in a study whose sample group largely consisted of failed heterosexual marriages where one of the parents was allegedly homosexual, make it impossible to extrapolate any information about same sex parenting. A review carried out by the American Medical Association noted that:\\"Brief of the American Psychological Association, the California Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Association of Social Workers and Its California Chapter, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychoanalytic Association as Amici Curiae in Support of Plaintiff - Appellee and in Support of Affirmance\\" American Medical Association, July 10, 2012 accessed 7 June 2013. > ... The data does not show whether the perceived romantic relationship ever > in fact occurred; nor whether the parent self-identified as gay or lesbian; > nor whether the same sex relationship was continuous, episodic, or one-time > only; nor whether the individual in these categories was actually raised by > a homosexual parent (children of gay fathers are often raised by their > heterosexual mothers following divorce), much less a parent in a long-term > relationship with a same-sex partner. Indeed, most of the participants in > these groups spent very little, if any, time being raised by a ‚Äúsame-sex > couple.‚Äù Some argue that the project's funding source, the Witherspoon Institute, a conservative think tank, ultimately biased the results; New York Times writer Mark Oppenheimer speculated that Regnerus's Catholic faith may have shaped the way he approached the study of same-sex relationships. When asked whether his funding source (the Witherspoon Institute) is conservative, Regnerus responded by stating, \\"Yes. And the Ford Foundation is a pretty liberal one. Every academic study is paid for by someone. I‚Äôve seen excellent studies funded by all sorts of interest groups.\\" His relationship with Witherspoon continued after the New Family Structures Study. According to Regnerus's financial disclosures for the year 2013, after the study's publication, that same organization paid him between $20,000 and $39,999.99 to ‚Äú[design], [organize] and [lead] a several-day seminar for graduate students in June 2013 on the conceptual foundations involved in contemporary sociological thought and the conduct of social science research\\" and other related consulting work. Regnerus contributed to an amicus brief in opposition to same-sex marriagehttp://www.adfmedia.org/files/HollingsworthAmicusSocialScienceProfessors.pdf and appeared as an expert witness in a 2014 federal court hearing regarding Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage. Citing widespread criticism of NFSS methodology, Judge Bernard A. Friedman rejected Regnerus's testimony, alleging the arguments derived from methodologically flawed data were \\"not worthy of serious consideration\\" and served rather to please the conservative organizations (Witherspoon Institute and Bradley Foundation) that underwrote the survey research project. Then-University of Texas' College of Liberal Arts Dean Randy Diehl wrote in a 2015 post-tenure review conclusion letter obtained by University of Texas' Daily Texan that \\"Because the design of the study ensured that the parental same-sex relationship variable was confounded with the family structure stability variable, it is not possible to conclude that the different life outcomes between the two groups were caused by the parental relationship variable...no policy implications about same-sex parenting should be drawn from the study.‚Äù The public and academic reaction to Regnerus's research has been referred to as a \\"witch hunt\\" by his former mentor Christian Smith. In his book The Sacred Project of American Sociology, Smith calls this backlash a result of the content of sociology's \\"sacred project\\" (of mitigating oppression, inequality, etc.); Smith argued that the critical reaction e.g. on methodological issues displayed a set of double standards insofar as work by other scholars could be (but is generally not) subjected to similar criticism.Smith, Christian. The Sacred Project of American Sociology. Oxford University Press, 2014 Smith said that \\"The push-back\\" to Regnerus's article \\"is coming simply because some people don't like where the data led.\\" =Views= During a speech at Franciscan University of Steubenville in 2014 titled \\"What Sexual Behavior Patterns Reveal about the Mating Market and Catholic Thought\\", Regnerus's views on same-sex relationships continued to spread controversy when he claimed that \\"normalization of gay men's sexual behavior\\" in society will contribute to a surge in the \\"practice of heterosexual anal sex.\\"In March 2019, Regnerus joined other conservative writers to reject the \\"pre-Trump conservative consensus\\" which combined Libertarian economics with social liberalism. They alleged American Conservatism had \\"surrendered to the pornographization of daily life, to the culture of death, to the cult of competitiveness\\" and a \\"poisonous and censorious multiculturalism.\\" The statement went on to criticize the cutting of the \\"link between sex and gender\\", legal abortion, a \\"borderless world\\" fueling \\"attempts to displace American citizens\\", and business leaders and political parties which \\"held investors and 'job creators' above workers and citizens.\\" It called for greater emphasis on local communities and \\"prioritiz[ing] work over consumption.\\" Regarding the connection between one's faith and the activities of Christian professors, Regnerus noted in an alumni profile that \\"I believe that if your faith matters, it should inform what you teach and what you research\\". Awards In 1999 and 2001 Regnerus won the Distinguished Article Award from the Sociology of Religion Section of the American Sociological Association.

He was known for his religious and allegorical paintings who created easel paintings as frescos. He was a specialist figure painter who regularly collaborated with specialist still life painters on decorative Baroque still lifes and garland paintings. Vaccaro attempted to adapt the stylistic features of 17th-century Neapolitan tradition to the new Classicist and Baroque trends towards increasing Arcadian tendencies. He proposed his own specific form of Academism, aimed at revitalizing the figurative culture in Naples.Maria Claudia Izzo, Nicola Vaccaro, 1640-1709.

The couple's second son Andrea became also an artist and inherited his father's precious collection of drawings. Nicola attended the drawing classes of the Accademia del Nudo (Academy of the Nude), established in Naples in 1664 and of which his father, Andrea, was director and, at the same time, treasurer. Through these classes Nicola acquired good expressive ability in the representation of the anatomy of the human body, gestures and physiognomy.Gerardo Pecci, Il dipinto poco noto di Nicola Vaccaro al Museo Diocesano in: La Citt√† Moses defending the daughters of Jethro He later fell in love with Giulietta Zuffi, a singer of the theater with whom he had a scandalous relationship. To please her he took up the position of manager at the Teatro di San Bartolomeo, an opera house in Napels, active mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries. He was the administrator, librettist and set designer of the theatre from 1683 to 1689. His mistress Zuffi was during this period the protagonist of the theater seasons. His activity in the field of theater was not separate from his artistic and existential trajectory, but was inseparable from the rest of his pictorial production. He wrote libretti for the theatre productions. He designed the theatre sets for which he likely also painted some of the decorations. He devised a new system for changing the sets. The theatrical activity of Nicola Vaccaro coincided with the famous season of Alessandro Scarlatti, an important moment for the history of music in Naples. Vaccaro ensured the collaboration of the great musician throughout the course of his management, thus demonstrating a modern managerial sensitivity. Vaccaro produced 18 shows during his tenure. All the works were first performed at the Royal Palace and then at the public Teathre of San Bartolomeo. He was kept so busy that his output as a painter was significantly reduced. Despite his hard work his tenure as manager of the theatre was not successful.Nicola Vaccaro (Naples 1640‚Äì1709), Adam and Eve with the Infants Cain and Abel at Dorotheum Vaccaro's first wife died around 1690 and he married a second time. Work Young woman picking figs with three children in a terraced garden Nicola Vaccaro was a versatile painter, who covered a wide range of subjects including religious, historical and mythological themes. He was also able to integrate still lifes and landscapes in his paintings in collaboration with specialist painters such as Abraham Brueghel, Francesco Della Quosta, Aniello Ascione and Andrea Belvedere. He painted on various carriers including wood panels, copper, brass and crystal, and also practised fresco painting. Like his father, his work is characterised by its eclecticism. Among the Neapolitan artists, he can be regarded as an alternative to the trends represented respectively by Luca Giordano and Francesco Solimena. Vaccaro attempted to adapt the stylistic features of the 17th-century Neapolitan tradition to the new Classicist and Baroque trends with their emphasis on Arcadian landscapes. His work can be regarded as an expression of a new academism in art. With Francesco Di Maria, Giacomo Farelli and Andrea Malinconico, he regarded the starting points of their working method as the practice of drawing, the knowledge of human anatomy and the study of the great masters of the past. In addition they relied on their thorough knowledge of the classics, to achieve an original interpretation of their subjects. His style gradually lost its initial formal rigidity and academic composure of the beginnings in favor of a language based on the grace of gestures, the serenity of the mood, on the studied compositional proportions. His clientele was of two kinds: the religious institutions of his region and private clients.

Formed in October 1940, the battalion served in Malaya as part of the 27th Brigade, which was assigned to the 8th Division. Recruited mainly from volunteers drawn from the state of Victoria, after completing its training around Bonegilla and then Bathurst, the 2/29th Battalion was sent to Malaya in August 1941 along with the rest of the 27th Brigade to bolster the Australian force there and subsequently fought in the Malayan Campaign following the Japanese attack in December 1941. The battalion fought several delaying actions along the west coast, including fighting around Bakri and Muar, and in Johore, before Allied forces withdrew across the Causeway to Singapore. The battalion later took part in the defence of Singapore in February 1942, but was captured after the garrison capitulated on 15 February. They spent the remainder of the war as prisoners of war, with many dying in captivity. History Raised on 17 October 1940 amidst an expansion of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) following an escalation of hostilities in Europe, the 2/29th Battalion was established with volunteers drawn mainly from Victoria. Together with the 2/26th and 2/30th Battalions, it formed part of the 27th Brigade, the third and final brigade raised as part of the 8th Division, and the final brigade raised as part of the 2nd AIF. The colours chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 29th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were black and yellow, in an upright rectangle, although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval border denoted that the battalion was an 8th Division unit. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies ‚Äì designated 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì each consisting of three platoons. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Robertson, the battalion's initial personnel drafts concentrated at Bonegilla where they conducted rudimentary training, prior to the battalion moving to Bathurst, where it joined the other two battalions of the 27th Brigade, which moved its headquarters from Sydney at this time. Around the same time as the 2/29th moved to Bathurst, the 22nd Brigade was deployed to Malaya to form part of the British garrison forces there, and in mid-1941, as concerns grew about a Japanese attack in the Pacific, it was decided that the 27th Brigade would be despatched to join the 22nd. They subsequently embarked in July, having completed five months of further training at Bathurst during the Australian winter, and arrived in Singapore the following month. In early September, the battalion moved into Malaya, establishing itself in dispersed locations around Kahang and Kluang, before moving to Segamat later in the month, where further training took place to prepare them for the rigours of jungle warfare. When the Japanese launched their invasion of Malaya in early December 1941, the force of the attack initially fell on the British and Indian forces stationed on the north-east coast and around the Thai‚ÄìMalayan border, and as a result the 2/29th Battalion did not see action until the middle of January when the Japanese began to advance into Johore. As the situation on the western side of the peninsula worsened, the 2/29th, along with the 2/19th Battalion, were sent to reinforce the 45th Indian Infantry Brigade who were fighting around Muar. Lieutenant Ben Hackney of the 2/29th Battalion, one of only two men to survive the massacre at Parit Sulong. Changi Gaol, 20 Sept 1945 Arriving at Bakri on 17 January, the Australians established strong defensive positions and the following day, with assistance from an anti-tank regiment, repulsed a heavy Japanese attack that had been supported by armour. As the Japanese felt for the 2/29th Battalion's flanks, their position grew increasing tenuous and they were in danger of being surrounded. The arrival of the 2/19th allowed the 2/29th to withdraw, but further flanking moves by the Japanese cut off the withdrawal route. Fighting their way through several Japanese road blocks and almost constant air attack, they found the river crossing at Parit Sulong in Japanese hands and despite several efforts to wrest control of it, the combined Australian and Indian force had to break track and head into the jungle in an effort to reach Yong Peng, which was still in British hands. In the process, they had to leave their wounded behind with a handful of medical personnel, trusting that they would be cared for by the Japanese. In the end, all but two of the 135 men were executed by their captors. Of the two survivors, one was Lieutenant Ben Hackney of the 2/29th Battalion, who was later captured by the Japanese, but who survived the war as a prisoner. Heavily depleted by the withdrawal, the 2/29th was withdrawn back to Singapore; the 130 men that successfully completed the trek back to Yong Peng were joined by a draft of 500 fresh replacements, many of whom were very inexperienced having been rushed from in Australia with very little training. The battalion's commanding officer, Robertson, had been among those killed in action around Muar, and he was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Pond, previously the brigade major on the staff of the 27th Brigade, who subsequently led the battalion through the remainder of the short campaign. As the battalion was reconstituted with 19 new officers amongst the reinforcements, Pond sought to implement a hasty training program, in the short time available. Meanwhile, the fighting in Johore continued until 31 January when the Allied forces withdrew across the Causeway, which was subsequently blown up to delay Japanese forces from crossing the Strait of Johore. In anticipation of a Japanese assault across the strait, the Australian forces took up defensive positions in the north-western side of Singapore island, with the 27th Brigade assuming a position west of the Causeway. Despite the battalion's inexperience, it was assigned the role of divisional reserve and given additional tasks related to rear-area security. When the Japanese assault came on 8 February, the main thrust initially on the 22nd Brigade's positions further west, but as the situation worsened the 2/29th was sent to Tengah airfield to bolster the 22nd Brigade's defence of the north-west sector. Plans were made to launch a counter-attack to re- capture the village of Ama Keng, but these were cancelled when further Japanese advances made this impossible. Throughout 9 February, the battalion fought to hold the airfield against growing Japanese attacks before the defenders were forced to withdraw further back to the Bulim line, positioned on the Choa Chu Kang Road in between the 2/18th Battalion and a composite unit. There, the battalion turned back a Japanese attack on 10 February, but after neighbouring units withdrew amidst the confusion, the 2/29th were also forced back. Withdrawing in contact, elements of the battalion became separated until they were regrouped at Bukit Panjang. Over the course of the week, further fighting pushed them back to the Kranji‚ÄìJurong line where the 2/29th experienced the main force of a further Japanese thrust after the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade was pushed back by two Japanese divisions. Lacking supporting fires following obfuscation from higher headquarters, the battalion was nearly split in half as it withdrew in contact again towards high ground around Bukit Timah. In the process of the withdrawal, individual platoons were forced to fight their way back to Allied lines. At Bukit Timah, the battalion again regrouped minus one company which found itself detached and subsequently fought alongside the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Further fighting saw the Allied forces withdraw towards Singapore City's suburbs, where elements of the 2/29th were used to shore up the line along the Reformatory Road along with part of the 2/20th Battalion and the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion. The Australian forces subsequently formed a perimeter around Tanglin Barracks where they were making preparations for a counter-attack by the time the garrison surrendered on 15 February following the loss of the city's main water reservoirs. The battalion's remaining personnel were subsequently ordered to congregate around Changi prison where they were captured. They remained prisoners of war for over three years. During this time, they were moved to camps across south-east Asia, including Japan, Burma, Thailand, and the Dutch East Indies where they were pressed into hard labour and subjected to harsh conditions. A total of 582 personnel from the 2/29th were killed in action or died in captivity, while 143 were wounded in action.

Electric spiral lift coasters, which became very common in the 1970s, differed from later steel roller coaster designs in track gauge. History Contemporary press accounts quote Great Adventure Vice President of Operations Robert Minick as saying that Jumbo Jet was \\"the largest ready-made roller coaster that [could] be bought\\". The coaster was leased from Willy Miller's Continental Park Attractions, along with several other rides in the Fun Fair section. Assembled in the spring of 1975, the ride stood idle for weeks, never to be operated or opened to the public, before being dismantled one month later. The ultimate fate of the ride remains unknown. Although Roller Coaster DataBase once proposed that it might be the Jumbo Jet at Morey's Piers,greatadventurehistory.com forums evidence exists that the latter attraction was in fact purchased in Germany. RCDB later listed the Canadian National Exhibition as another possible site at which the ride may have operated.

Life Roman Chatov was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, to a theater impresario and his wife. He began drawing in his teenage years, including doing magazine illustrations at age 16 and being a military- correspondent painter near the end of World War I. Chatov was first trained in art in Russia and Paris, France. He moved to New York with his family in 1922 due to the Bolshevik Revolution and Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War. Chatov later joined the Art Students League and the National Academy of Arts in order to improve his art training and skills. Chatov initially designed costumes and painted murals, including painting murals for the Ford and Palestinian Pavilions at the 1939 New York World's Fair under a commission from the New Deal Works Progress Administration. Among his most notable work was a set of murals for New York City's Russian Tea Room restaurant; these murals are now in the collection of a New York City museum. These successes led to his getting many painting commissions throughout the U.S. afterwards. Chatov also designed costumes for Florenz Ziegfeld. Dancer Isadora Duncan expressed her admiration for his costume designs, and he painted a silk scarf for her, the scarf that led to her death when it became entangled in the wheel of a moving car. While in New York, Chatov met many of the most prominent artists and painters in the area, including Willem de Kooning, with whom he shared studio space. Under commission to MGM, Chatov and his brother Constantin painted portraits of famous Hollywood celebrities including Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Chatov married Geneva McCormack in 1942. In his later years, he primarily painted portraits, and also opened an art studio in Atlanta with the help of his brother Constantin. Chatov received the Governor‚Äôs Award from the Georgia Council for the Arts and Humanities in 1983. He died in 1987 at the age of 86 or 87. His son Marc Chatov (born in 1953) continues in his father's footsteps today by working as an artist and an art instructor.

Delayed by World War II, construction took place from 1947 though 1948. At the time, it was the longest bridge built by the Michigan State Highway Department. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Blossomland Bridge is the middle of the three bridges. Image is undated, but predates November 2004. Detail of one of the bridge's concrete piers Traffic congestion between St. Joseph and Benton Harbor prompted the state highway department to relocate U.S. Route 31, now M-63. The route included a moveable span that exacerbated the problem due to its frequent breakdowns. A new bridge was needed to span the St. Joseph River, which carried steamboat traffic, resulting in a bascule design. Plans were discussed in the early 1940s, but construction was delayed until after the end of World War II. Even though supply shortages continued after war's end, the Blossomland Bridge was one of the state's priorities. The bridge was designed by consulting engineers Hazelet and Erdal of Chicago, a process thought to be completed by the end of 1946. Some financial aid was obtained by the highway department from the federal government. Construction bids were requested in December 1946, and when opened on January 9, 1947, W. J. Meagher and Sons of Bay City was awarded the role of general contractor at a bid of $747,497. American Bridge Company supplied and erected the bridge steel for $512,240. Construction was completed in 1948 at a total cost of over $1.3 million, and the bridge was pictured on the cover of Michigan Roads and Construction in November. It was dedicated on October 27, 1948, in honor of the mayor of St. Joseph, Waldo V. Tiscornia. Commissioner of the highway department Charles Ziegler served as guest of honor at the ribbon-cutting ceremony. At the time, it was the longest bridge built under the auspices of the highway department. The bridge opened December 24, 1948, after road approaches were completed. Rehabilitation work took place in 1966, including the replacement of the original railings, remnants of which are located along a staircase at one corner of the bridge. The bridge was eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion C for its rare type and connection to the engineering firm of Hazelet and Erdal. The bridge was listed on the register on December 17, 1999. Two other bridges in Berrien County, the Avery Road‚ÄìGalien River Bridge and the North Watervliet Road‚ÄìPaw Paw Lake Outlet Bridge, were added the same day. Design and location The Blossomland Bridge is in northern downtown St. Joseph. The bridge has seven spans with a Scherzer rolling-lift bascule main span. The bascule span and the two flanking it are built of steel deck plate-girders, while the nothermmost and three southernmost spans are steel stringers. The main span is supported by machinery-containing concrete piers, while the approaches are supported by four-column concrete piers. The abutments and wing walls are also made of concrete. At the bridge's southern corner is a staircase which leads down to the location of a former road and railroad tracks. The metal panel railings on these stairs are original and constituted the bridge's main railings before they were replaced. There is a bridge plate at southern corner and a memorial plate at the southeastern pedestrian refuge.

Sobin opposed a proposed law that would have prohibited minors from being inside certain clubs in late hours. Prissy Williams-Godfrey was the Libertarian Party candidate for the Ward 2 seat on the Council. Williams-Godfrey was a prostitute and managed a brothel. Police arrested her, saying her campaign offices were actually brothels. Her name did not appear on general election ballots. Sobin came in seventh place with 3,419 votes, or one percent of the total vote. = 1990 election cycle = Nancy Lord ran for Mayor of the District of Columbia as a Libertarian in 1990.

Kampia advocated for the District's full representation in the United States Congress. He said that District residents should be exempt from all federal taxes until the District receives full representation in Congress. Matthew G.

On his blog, Majors posted advice to attendees of the 2010 Restoring Honor rally that attendees should avoid two Metrorail lines because they go through certain neighborhoods. He wrote that many parts of the District are safe, \\"but why chance it if you don't know where you are?\\" During his 2012 campaign, Majors told a reporter from The Washington Post that he expected to lose. He said his goal was to receive at least 7,500 votes in order to secure major-party status for the Libertarian Party and make it far easier for its candidates to appear on the ballot.

The structure is one in which an overpass and the station building have been combined. Although over-track stations are considered a type of on-ground train station, sub- surface train stations and elevated train stations may also have over-track structure. In the case of over-track sub-surface stations, it is common for the station building to be at ground level, and some such stations may be considered underground stations. There are also examples of stations that are both elevated and over-track.  Overview  Over-track stations are often the result of the rebuilding of on-ground stations. It is difficult to make on- ground stations accessible from both sides of the railway without building separate stations buildings on each side of the tracks. Although they may have increased upkeep costs, by gathering facilities such as ticket gates and ticket sales areas into one location the functioning of the station can be simplified. Also, building an above-track station that includes a free passageway outside of the ticket gates can allow pedestrians to move freely between the two areas divided by the tracks.2006 White Paper on National Transportation, Section II: Directions of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, (4)Facilities at transportation contact points (Japanese only)  Layout  Because the station building of an over- track station and its facilities are gathered entirely above the platforms, some of the merits of on-ground stations are lost. In some cases the distances necessary to walk when using the station can be even longer than those required for sub-surface or elevated stations. It is also necessary to move vertically to get between the station building and any platform. Because steps can be obstacles to the elderly and physically disabled when going up or down, devices such as elevators and escalators have been installed between the station building and platform and between the station building and the ground level to make some over-track stations barrier-free. Locating the station building above the platforms can be a way of effectively using space in places where it is limited, and can also make outfitting stations to be barrier-free easier in such places. This is one reason for the construction of above-track stations when building or rebuilding a station. When an over-track station is built on a slope, the station building may be directly accessible from the higher side of the slope without any difference in elevation. However, viewed from the low side the station may appear similar to a station that is both elevated and above-track.  Area surrounding the station  By making a station above-track, the overall space inside the station can often be increased, making it easier to include facilities such as bathrooms and shops. Because of their structure, it is easy for over-track stations to connect with pedways. As a result, in heavily commercial areas, over-track stations are also sometimes introduced as a way of connecting commercial facilities. Also, in cases where an on-ground station was changed to an over-track station, the land where the old station building stood can be used to create facilities such as rotaries, which can in turn make it possible to increase the number of buses and other services.

It takes its name from the Otherworld in Welsh mythology. Currently, the band is signed to M&O; Music and have released their first full-length album Forbidden Songs through the label on 23 April 2012. They have also released two demo's, Behind the Veil and Newydd Wawr, and one EP, Swords & Blood. History =Formation (2007)= Before Anwynn, Wallace, Mathias and Fred were playing in a heavy metal band named Arawn. Arawn split up in December 2006 but Wallace, Mathias and Fred decided to continue the adventure together and founded Anwynn. At first they wanted to remain a traditional heavy metal band, so they began looking for a male singer. But they quickly decided to give every candidate a chance and auditioned female singers as well. In February 2007, bassist Vincent \\"Wobi\\" Van Loo joined the band, shortly followed by mezzo-soprano female singer Amandine Blanquet in April 2007. =First gigs and Behind the Veil (2008-2009)= Anwynn began playing their first gig at VitamineZ in Wavre, where the band received the audience's prize; then at Angel's Rock I in Uccle, at the B52 in Ostende and at the Factory in Li√®ge, among many others. In 2008, Anwynn released their first demo, Behind the Veil. The band then encountered some line-up changes: Mathias left the band and was replaced by Jeremy Laitem (Sekhmet), and Vladimir was hired to play the keyboards. Anwynn slowly began to evolve into a symphonic metal band. =Newydd Wawr and line-up changes (2010-2011)= The year 2010 was a real turnover for Anwynn, as four new members joined the band : Astrid Kaiserman on keyboards, Beno√Æt Becker on rhythm guitar, Vincent \\"McBouc\\" Carton on vocals and Forster Perelsztejn on drums, replaced by Laurent Verheylewegen later on. Anwynn began to write much more aggressive material and evolved into a melodic death metal band with symphonic elements. The band announced that Newydd Wawr, their second demo, would be released in December 2010. Anwynn then played at Power Prog and Metal Festival 2010 with headliners Scorpions in April and at Metal Female Voices Festival 2010 with Arch Enemy, Epica, The Agonist and many more. At the beginning of 2011, Laurent and Beno√Æt left the band due to musical differences. =Forbidden Songs (2011-2020)= In July 2011, Julien \\"Jukka\\" Huyssens joined Anwynn on rhythm guitar. The band announced that they will be entering the studio in October to record their first album, Forbidden Songs. The album was recorded, mixed and mastered at Manic Studio by Olivier Wittenberg (Manic Movement), who also played as a session drummer on the record. It was released by the French label M&O; Music on April 23, 2012 and received positive reviews from the critics. Anwynn then started touring with new drummer Florent \\"Flush\\" Boudry to promote their album and played gigs with bands like Diabulus in Musica for their The Wanderer Tour along with Skeptical Minds and Izegrim. They played at various festivals in Belgium like DarkMoon Festival, RommelRock 2012 with Grave Digger, Sirenia and Cripper but were also invited to play in Flensburg, Germany by the Danish power metal band Seven Thorns. The band announced that they will play at the 10th Anniversary Edition of Metal Female Voices Festival on October 20, 2012, with Lacuna Coil, Arch Enemy, Delain, Arkona and more. =InHuman (2020-present)= On October 13, 2020, the band changed its name into InHuman, revealing on their new website, that Anwynn is no more. Musical style and lyrical themes =Musical style= Anwynn mixes various musical genres, with songs often containing traditional death metal riffs, more heavy metal-influenced solos and massive orchestrations. The band also features two lead singers: McBouc for male death metal vocals and Amandine for classical female mezzo-soprano singing. =Influences= Much of the band is influenced by various European and American metal acts, including Amon Amarth, Cannibal Corpse, Nightwish, Iron Maiden, Hatebreed, Machine Head, Dimmu Borgir, Arch Enemy, Leaves' Eyes, Tristania and many others. =Lyrics= The band's lyrics consist of several different themes, mainly upon celtic mythology but also piracy in \\"Across the Seven Seas\\" or conquest of the New World in \\"Conquistador\\".

Pope Clement VII appointed him to several positions in the Roman Curia and gave him several nunciatures. Pope Paul III made him nuncio to the Kingdom of Portugal in 1541, and later that same year to the Kingdom of France to announce the calling of the Council of Trent. He was a datary from 1541 to 1544. In 1541, he also served as treasurer of the Apostolic Camera. He was the cardinal who announced what measures the Papal States would take to defend itself against possible attack by the Ottoman Empire. On February 6, 1542, he was elected Bishop of Nice. Before he took possession of the see, on July 30, 1544, he was transferred to the Diocese of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. Upon the recommendation of Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto, Pope Paul III made him a cardinal deacon in the consistory of December 19, 1544.

He played 16 test matches (25 total games), most frequently in the first-five back position, for New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, from 1955 until 1962. Career Ross Brown, one of the finest backs produced by Taranaki where he was always affectionately known as \\"Pascoe,\\" ended his long, illustrious career, both for his province and the All Blacks, as something of a paradox. Brown's career which embraced 207 first class games, and well in excess of 100 for Taranaki, came in two distinct stages. In the first, between 1955 and 1962, either first five-eighths or in the midfield at either centre or second five, he was a regular All Black selection. Yet then he was frequently criticised for being too much of a runner and not possessing a good enough kicking game. In his second phase, from 1963 until he retired four or five years later, he was criticised, but this time, much to the bemusement of the genial Brown himself, he was constantly under attack for what was seen as excessive use of the boot. This undoubtedly stemmed from the leading role he had as the captain and first five in the Taranaki side which held the Ranfurly Shield between 1963‚Äì65. Brown was a potent weapon for Taranaki with his suddenly found talent for dropped goals. He landed 10 alone in the 1964 season, including three in a shield defence against North Auckland. That Brown should be regarded as primarily a kicker was ironic, particularly for the man himself. As a youngster he had always been a runner and even in his latter years would have loved to have been seen more as an attacker. Rather than being remembered as a marksman dropkicker Brown got more pleasure from the fact he scored 70-odd tries in his first class career and created many others. In the mid 1960s Brown was regarded by his Taranaki coach and close friend, John Stewart, as being at the top of his game. Yet because he was now perceived as being only a kicker he found himself left out of All Black sides and being judged as not fitting the 15-man game being advocated by the then coach, Fred Allen. Brown, however, had had the satisfaction of a rewarding career and a lengthy stint as an All Black, especially in the mid to late 1950s. Brown had an excellent rugby pedigree, being the son of Handley, a three quarter in the famous 1924-25 Invincibles, and was the nephew of Henry, also an All Black three quarter on the 1935-36 tour of Britain. From his first XV days as a boarder at Auckland's King's College (1st XV 1951‚Äì52, 1st XI captain and athletics champion) it was clear that Brown was an outstanding rugby talent and while still a teenager made his debut for Taranaki in 1953 and one year later played for the North in the annual interisland match. Aged only 20, he received his first test cap as a centre against the Wallabies at Eden Park in 1955. He was in the midfield for the opening three tests against the 1956 Springboks but moved into fly half during the third test at Lancaster Park. He immediately placed a precise cross kick which produced a try for left wing Ron Jarden and remained at fly half for the fourth test a fortnight later at Eden Park. Even though in those years he was usually at centre for Taranaki, particularly during the 1957-59 shield reign, Brown was pretty much the All Blacks' first choice at fly half for the next two or three seasons. Unfortunately, for family reasons he was not available for the 1960 tour of South Africa. But he regained his All Black place for the 1961 test series against France playing at second five. He made the tour of Australia a year later but then dropped out of national reckoning despite continuing to be a key player for Taranaki for many subsequent years. In all Brown played 25 matches for the All Blacks including 16 tests, one regret from his international career being the fact he never went on one of the landmark major tours of his time to either South Africa or Britain and France. He toured only twice with the All Blacks, to Australia, in 1957 and 1962, but was also a member of the powerful New Zealand Under 23 team that toured Hong Kong and Japan in 1958. His brother Don represented Taranaki 1954 and King Country 1957 whilst his son Andrew played for Manawatu 1985 and Taranaki 1986.Stats  allblacks.com Ross Brown died in New Plymouth on 20 May 2014.Legendary All Black back Ross Brown dies  Stuff.co.nz References Category:1934 births Category:2014 deaths Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:Rugby union fly-halves Category:Rugby union players from New Plymouth Category:New Zealand international rugby union players ","title":"Ross Brown (rugby union)"},{"id":"36725773","text":"Charles T.

This dispersed settlement is surrounded by woods, is divided into Ober- and Unterjugel (\\"Upper and Lower Jugel\\") and runs along the German- Czech border from the Lehmergrund (708 m) to the crest of the Western Ore Mountains (873 m). In the vicinity lies the 980 metre-high Scheffelsberg. Jugel is a tourist destination for hikers and winter sportsmen. The village may be reached by railway on the Zwickau‚ÄìAue‚ÄìSchwarzenberg‚ÄìJohanngeorgenstadt line and by car along Staatsstra√üe 272 which runs from Schwarzenberg via Johanngeorgenstadt to Wildenthal.  History  The founding of the village goes back to the days of the mining industry in the 16th century. In 1561, the phrase an der Gugell appears in the records. In 1571, Sebastian Prei√üler built a glassworks with eight houses in what later became Oberjugel, where sheet glass, glasses and beakers were manufactured for the electoral Saxon court in Dresden. This glassworks closed in the early 18th century. Today the territory of Oberjugel incorporates the houses of Henneberg, including a popular pub not far from the Kleiner Kranichsee (928 m), and a raised bog, which is protected as a nature reserve. At the southeast edge of Oberjugel In Unterjugel, a timber mill (Brettm√ºhle) and a paint mill, belonging to Johann Gabriel Lobel a grandson of Prei√üler, were operated using the hydropower of the Pechh√∂fer Bach stream for the manufacture of cobalt blue paint. L√∂bel's mill, the Unterjugel Blue Colour Works (Blaufarbenwerk Unterjugel), to which six houses for the paint workers belonged, passed in 1668 into the possession of the Elector of Saxony and, in 1677, merged with the Oberschlema Blue Colour Works (Blaufarbenwerk Oberschlema).

It is located about south east of Muttaburra and north west of Alpha near the town of Aramac in Queensland. The district was first explored by William Landsborough in 1859 who named the Aramac Creek, a tributary of the Thomson River after a former pastoralist, Robert Ramsay MacKenzie. The station, in turn, takes its name from the creek. The station was established in 1863, shortly after Bowen Downs Station in 1862. Aramac Station was initially settled by John Rule and Dyson Lacey along the banks of the creek, and they stocked the area with sheep. The early part of the year and several waterholes failed causing other pastoralists in the area to move on. When the rains came in June the creek flooded and the homestead was found to be too close to the creek and had to be moved to higher ground. Lacey was later speared along with another of the station shepherds by Aboriginal men. The first manager of the station was Mr Gordon, who worked for Rule and Lacey. During his time there, there was a tribal war between Aboriginal people on the area at a part of the property called Greyrock, where many were killed. Originally occupying an area of approximately , the station is made up of about two thirds open and grazing country and about one third described as desert country. In 1867 an employee of Aramac, John Kingston, started a trading post at an outlying point of the creek that later became the town of Aramac. Rule left Aramac in 1871, An Aboriginal shepherd murdered a European man at Aramac in 1872. Roderick Travers had bought Aramac off Rule and Lacey some time prior to 1873 and added it to his other holding of Malvern Downs which combined held some 60,000 sheep and 10,000 cattle. 3,000 sheep from the station were sold off in 1873 and taken to Mr McCormack's Peak Downs Station. By 1875 the station was owned by Messrs Travers and Gibson, who had a flock of approximately 20,000 sheep on the run. By this stage they also had about fenced suitable for both cattle and sheep. This in turn reduced the number of dog attacks on the flock. An additional 15,000 sheep were delivered to the station from Malvern Downs in 1876, along with 15 stud bulls that arrived later in the dry season. Several bushfires broke out in December 1876 resulting in the death of a man named Robert Durban and a Kanaka labourer who were carting water to men who were beating out the flames when he got burnt. Two horses and a dray were also lost during the fire. The men were volunteers from town who had come to help the Forsyths, of Aramac Station, to quell the blaze. The Forsyths later established a fund to help Durban's widow. Messrs. Anderson and Nicoll of Manuka Station purchased 10,000 sheep from Aramac that were droved overland and delivered in 1879 with the stock looking remarkably well. In 1880 Travers and Gibson bought 5636 ewes from Huntly Station for Aramac. Another 5,000 were sent to Aramac from Spottiswoode Station in 1881. Sometime prior to 1890 the station fell into the hands of the Bank of New South Wales and was managed by William Forsyth but was later purchased in 1891 for ¬£100,000 by James Tolson who also owned the neighbouring properties of Corinda and Uanda Station. In 1900 the station had a flock of 150,000 sheep and was still owned by Tolson. The station was subdivided and put up for ballot in 1930 attracting 396 applicants from all over Australia. The property was split into seven different blocks ranging from to . The lnd was described as not being in first class order after being heavily stocked for many years. All the station plant, homestead and stock were sold off in 1930. Many of the selectors were among those who purchased the equipment. Some of the new newly formed properties were named Politic, Powella, Edgebaston and Stainburn.

PDF file __TOC__ Forms of plankton Phytoplankton (cyanobacteria) Zooplankton (waterflea) Phytoplankton are usually photosynthetic one-celled organisms. These organisms are usually found near the surface of the water due to their need for light energy for their photosynthetic processes. Phytoplankton provide most of the oxygen that is in the water and provide a large amount of food for other organisms in the water column. Zooplankton are heterotrophic plankton, which are animals that ingest nutrients rather than producing it via chemical reactions. Zooplankton can provide an important food source for juvenile fish. Some taxa are planktonic for only part of their life cycle. Forms of planktivory Planktivores ingest one or both types of plankton. Titanichthys was the first massive vertebrate pelagic planktivore, with a lifestyle similar to that of the modern basking, whale, or megamouth sharks. Most fish are planktivores during part or all of their life cycles, especially when they are larvae.Lazzaro, X. (1987). A review of planktivorous fishes: Their evolution, feeding behaviours, selectivities, and impacts. Hydrobiologia, 146, 97-167. There are obligate planktivores, which feed only on plankton, and facultative planktivores, which take plankton when available but eat other types of food as well. The gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), for example, has a voracious appetite for various forms of plankton across its life cycle. It is an obligate planktivore when it is a juvenile, in part due to its very small mouth size. As it grows it becomes an omnivore, taking phytoplankton, zooplankton, and larger pieces of nutritious detritus. Adult gizzard shad consume large volumes of zooplankton until it becomes scarce, then turn to organic debris for food.Stein, Roy A., et al. (1995). Food-web regulation by a planktivore: exploring the generality of the trophic cascade hypothesis. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 52(11): 2518-26. Planktivores obtain food in two ways. Particulate feeders eat planktonic items selectively. Filter feeders process volumes of water and strain food items en masse. \\"Tow-net\\" filter feeders swim rapidly with mouths open to filter the water, and pumping filter feeders suck in water via pumping actions. The latter includes stationary animals, such as corals. Another form of filter feeding is a \\"gulping\\" behavior, in which the animal takes boluses of water; the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) feeds in this manner. Planktivore ecology Plankton are among the lower trophic levels in food chains. Planktivores affect the food chain by altering the populations of plankton in various ways, a process known as the trophic cascade. The gizzard shad, again, plays this role. It consumes phytoplankton when it is small, zooplankton when it is larger, and other foods when it eliminates the zooplankton in the area. It incidentally controls the populations of other fish that depend on zooplankton, such as bluegill (Lepomis macrochiris).DeVries, D. R., and R. A. Stein. (1992). Complex interactions between fish and zooplankton: quantifying the role of an open-water planktivore. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 49(6): 1216-27.

Although South Georgia had been commercially exploited as a whaling station during the first half of the 20th century, its interior was generally unknown, and maps were largely based on the original survey by James Cook, who first landed on the island in 1775. The South Georgia Survey was intended to make high-quality modern maps covering the entire island, and took place in four austral summer seasons: 1951‚Äì52, 1953‚Äì54, 1955‚Äì56, and 1956‚Äì57. The survey was funded by the Royal Geographical Society, the Falkland Islands Dependencies, Odhams Press, and other private supporters. The War Office and Ministry of Supply provided 250 man-days of cold-weather rations, along with a loan of clothing and sledging equipment. Transportation to and from South Georgia was provided on the ships used to supply the whaling stations and ferry whale oil back to market. The survey members also often rode along on the whaling vessels to survey the coasts of the island and to be dropped off or picked up for inland work. The survey used the whaling settlement of Grytviken as its base of operations in South Georgia, with lodging provided in the Grytviken jail, which had space for 3‚Äì4 men and was generally unoccupied. 1951‚Äì52 season The first expedition consisted of six men: Carse, deputy leader Kevin Walton, the surveyors Gordon Smillie and John Heaney, the geologist Alec Trendall, and the mountaineer Walter Roots. The expedition departed from Glasgow on the whaling tanker Southern Opal on 16 Sept 1951, and arrived in South Georgia on 1 November. The goals for this campaign were to map the southwest coast of the island between Cape Disappointment and King Haakon Bay, and to survey the interior of the island to the south and west of the Allardyce Range (the side away from the whaling stations). The surveying was hampered in early January when the geologist Trendall fell into a crevasse and severely injured his left leg. The party spent a week transporting the injured man back to Grytviken, where he was cared for in the whaling station's hospital and sent home on the vessel Orwell. The remaining members of the expedition resumed the survey in late January and continued through late March, and by the end of the season, about 35‚Äì40% of the interior of the island had been mapped. The survey showed that South Georgia was somewhat thinner overall than indicated by previous maps, and this realization suggested that complete coverage could be attained with three seasons' work. The party left South Georgia on 18 April, again on the Southern Opal. 1953‚Äì54 season The second campaign consisted of four men: the medical officer K. Warburton, in addition to Carse, Smillie, and Trendall from the earlier campaign. They left Glasgow aboard the Polar Maid on 29 August 1953 and arrived in Leith Harbour on 10 October. From the beginning of the expedition Warburton was ill, with a probable duodenal ulcer. He was left behind in Grytviken, and sent home on the Orwell early in 1954. The three other members carried on the work of the survey, but were troubled by bad weather and the early departure of Smillie. Carse and Trendall left South Georgia aboard the Southern Opal on 17 April. Carse's South Georgia Survey did not make a campaign during the 1954‚Äì55 year. However, there was a British South Georgia Expedition led by George Sutton. This expedition was primarily aimed at mountaineering, although they did perform some surveying, and these results were incorporated into the South Georgia Survey's final maps. 1955‚Äì56 season The third campaign was more ambitious and consisted of a larger group of eight men. Carse remained as leader, and Warburton was the doctor and deputy leader. The two surveyors were Tony Bomford and Stan Paterson. George Spenceley was the photographer, and there were three mountaineers: Tom Price, Louis Baume, and John Cunningham. Planning before the expedition focused on four areas that had not been adequately covered so far. A secondary goal was to determine the route used by Ernest Shackleton in his famous 1916 winter traverse during the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. The party arrived in Leith Harbour on 24 September 1955, on the Southern Opal. The surveying in this third season succeeded in filling the four major blank spaces in the map of the island, and identifying the uncertain segments of Shackleton's traverse. The party departed for home on the Southern Garden on 3 April 1956. 1956‚Äì57 season Carse returned alone to complete the survey of a few remaining unmapped areas. He remained at South Georgia from September 25 through mid-November.

Biography Originating from the town of Histonium, and the son of a senator, Suetrius Sabinus began his senatorial career under the reign of the emperor Septimius Severus. His first role was as a member of the Decemviri Stlitibus Iudicandis which he filled around AD 193 or 194. He then stood as one of the imperial candidates for the office of Quaestor in AD 201, before again standing for the office of Plebeian Tribune in AD 203. He was eventually elected to the office of praetor de liberalibus causis in AD 206.Mennen, p. 125 Suetrius Sabinus was next sent as a Legatus to Africa before returning to Rome to act as curator viarum viae Latinae novae (or curator of the Via Latina) from AD 209 to 210. His next posting was as iuridicus per Aemiliam et Liguriam, which he held from AD 210 to 211. Suetrius Sabinus then served under the new emperor Caracalla during his campaign against the Alamanni from AD 211 to 213. At first he was a Legatus legionis of the Legio XXII Primigenia, serving in Germania Superior before he was promoted to the rank of praepositus vexillarii of Legio XI Claudia.Mennen, pp. 125-126 By AD 213, he was the Comes in expeditione Germanica (or head of the expedition against the Germanic tribes) before being appointed for a three- month stint as imperial legate of the province of Raetia, serving from October to December 213. An amicus (or intimate friend) of the emperor Caracalla, Suetrius Sabinus was appointed consul ordinarius alongside Lucius Valerius Messalla Apollinaris in AD 214. The fact that his first consulate was an ordinary one, not suffect, reinforces the notion that he was held in high regard by Caracalla.Mannen, p. 126 After his consulship, Caracalla appointed Suetrius Sabinus as a iudex (judge representing the emperor) in an unknown province, followed by a period as praefectus alimentorum (or the officer in charge of Rome‚Äôs food supply). Suetrius Sabinus next served as a Corrector, under the title of electus ad corrigendum statum Italiae, from AD 215 to 216. This was an exceptional appointment in terms of its function; it may be that his principal task was to deal with a breakdown of law and order in Italy during that time, with a rise in banditry afflicting the countryside. It is also possible that he was tasked with fixing the finances in the Italian communities, as the effects of Caracalla‚Äôs taxes were causing major difficulties throughout Italy.Lo Cascio, Elio, \\"The Government and Administration of the Empire in the Central Decades of the Third Century\\", in The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193-337 (ed. Alan Bowman, Averil Cameron, Peter Garnsey) (2005), p. 168 From AD 216 to 217, Suetrius Sabinus served as the imperial legate of Pannonia Inferior, but he was replaced on the orders of the new emperor Macrinus after the murder of Caracalla. He seemed to fall out of favour for a time, but eventually he was recalled and appointed as the Proconsular governor of Africa Proconsularis between AD 225 and 230. X. Loriat believes it is a reasonable conjecture that Suetris Sabinus played a role in the elevation of the young Gordian III in June 238, for he was appointed consul ordinarius a second time in 240, alongside Lucius Ragonius Venustus, an honor not bestowed on a private citizen since Gaius Bruttius Praesens in 153 and 180, and on few afterwards.X. Loriot, \\"Les consuls ordinaires de l'ann√©e 240 de notre √®re\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 12 (1973), p. 255 During his career, Suetrius Sabinus was both an Augur and a member of the College of Pontiffs, thus belonging to two of the four major priestly colleges. He may have lived in a house on the Aventine Hill in Rome.Richardson, L., A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (1992), pg. 135 Sources * Mennen, Inge, Power and Status in the Roman Empire, AD 193-284 (2011) References Category:2nd- century Romans Suetrius Sabinus Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Roman governors of Raetia Category:Roman governors of Africa Category:Roman legates Category:Augurs of the Roman Empire Appius Suetrius Sabinus Category:Appii Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Gaius Octavius Appius Suetrius Sabinus"},{"id":"36726316","text":"Polistovsky Nature Reserve, Polistovsky Zapovednik () is a strict nature reserve (a zapovednik) in the northwest of Russia, located in Bezhanitsky and Loknyansky Districts of Pskov Oblast, in the Polist-Lovat Swamp System.

Early life and career Born Adolphe-Gustave Chouquet in Le Havre, he spent six years in Paris studying at the Massin Institute, but devoted almost all his spare time to studying voice and piano and attending concerts at the Paris Conservatory. In 1836, after receiving his degree (bachelier √®s lettres), he returned to Le Havre, where his father was a banker. The latter lost his fortune in creating a railroad company (from Paris to the sea), and in 1840 the family moved to the United States. Gustave produced his first essays of music criticism in New York.F√©tis, \\"Chouquet (Adolphe-Gustave)\\", 1978, vol. 1, pp. 181‚Äì182. He was also a professor of French literature and history and published several textbooks of French language instruction.See Le√ßons et mod√®les de litt√©rature fran√ßaise 1846. After sixteen years devoted to education, a respiratory ailment caused him to move back to France, where he spent several winters in the warm climate of Le Midi. By 1860 he was permanently in Paris. In Paris In Paris Chouquet became a music journalist, writing articles for La France musicale and L'Art musicale, and occasionally contributed to Le M√©nestrel. He also became well known as the author of a great number of texts for songs (romances), cantatas, choral scenes and pieces for amateur performance, including the words for the cantata David Rizzio (the examination piece for the 1863 Prix de Rome in Music with the Grand Prize awarded to Jules Massenet), \\"1867,\\" with music by Laurent de Rill√© (performed at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1867, and the words for the Hymne √† la Paix (\\"Hymn to Peace\\") which won the poetry prize at that year's Exposition Universelle but which was never set to music. Chouquet participated in a contest held by the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, winning the Bordin prize in 1864 for his Histoire de la musique depuis le XIVe si√®cle jusqu‚Äô√† la fin du XVIIIe si√®cle (\\"History of Music from the 14th Century to the end of the 18th Century\\"), which was never published (according to Arthur Pougin in 1878). Chouquet was awarded the prize a second time in 1868 for his history of French opera, which was published in 1873 as Histoire de la musique dramatique en France depuis ses origines jusqu‚Äô√† nos jours (\\"History of Dramatic Music in France from its Origins to the Present Day\\"), which was recognized as one of the first important French works in the genre of music history and criticism. In 1871 Chouquet was appointed the curator of the Mus√©e Instrumental du Conservatoire (Conservatory Instrument Museum), which had been formed from the instrument collection of Louis Clapisson and purchased by the state. In spite of meagre resources, Chouquet was able to greatly expand the museum's holdings with numerous important acquisitions, including a collection of Native American and African instruments from Sch≈ìlcher, a deputy in the French National Assembly and another collection from a M. le docteur Fau. Chouquet published a catalog of the museum's collection in 1875 under the title Le Mus√©e du Conservatoire national de musique, catalogue raisonn√© des instruments de cette collection (\\"The National Conservatory Music Museum: Annotated Catalog of the Instruments of This Collection\\") and a second edition in 1884. The catalog was updated with supplements by L√©on Pillaut in 1894, 1899, and 1903, and the complete catalog was reprinted by Minkoff in 1993. In 1872 Chouquet became a contributor to the Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris and an editor in 1874, continuing until it ceased publication in 1880.Ellis 1995, p. 249. He was also on the editorial board of the Dictionnaire des beaux-arts and contributed numerous articles for the first edition of George Grove's A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (published in four volumes from 1878 to 1889). Many of Chouquet's articles continued to appear in subsequent editions of Grove's Dictionary until at least 1970.Blom 1954 (1970 reprint), vol. 1, p. xx.

It is found in the Amatola Mountains, the Bamboesberg, which is named after it, and the Drakensberg. Its generic name means \\"bushy reed\\", while the specific name means \\"tiled\\", an allusion to the rectangular pattern of veins on the leaves. Its common names include Bergbamboes, Wildebamboes and Mountain Bamboo. Bamboos are divided into three categories on the basis of their flowering cycle - annual flowering, irregular flowering and gregarious flowering occurring at long intervals with synchronised flower and seed production. Most bamboos belong to this last category with intermasts ranging from 3 to 120 years.Advances in Botanical Research vol 47 (2008) Thamnocalamus tessellatus also belongs to this third category and flowers at 45 year intervals - records from KwaZulu-Natal noting flowering in 1908, 1953 and 1998/99. It is regarded as rare and vulnerable, threatened by fire and exploitation, and is also a host of the IUCN Red Data Book listed butterfly Metisella syrinx.Sabonet Often found in association with Leucosidea sericea, this frost-resistant species grows in dense clumps up to 5 metres tall, preferring moist rocky places, and has hollow culms or canes of 2-2.5 cm in diameter. The leaves at the base of branches are reduced to papery sheaths, while other leaves are 4‚Äì12 cm long and sharply pointed with spiny margins and a strongly tessellated surface.The Grasses and Pastures of South Africa - Lucy Chippindall (1955)Kew This is the only bamboo native to South Africa, its closest relative, Thamnocalamus spathiflorus, being found in the Himalaya.Flowering of Fargesia nitida in the UK - Chris Stapleton Specimens of this plant were collected in the 1820s and 1830s by Ecklon in the Winterberg which is an extension of the Amatola range, and by Dr√®ge at Katberg near the western end of the Amatola range, Table Mountain in the Queenstown district, the Bamboesberge in the Tarkastad district, the Witteberg above Lady Grey and other high mountainous areas in the Cape Colony, such as the Prentjiesberg north of Ugie. Neither collector found the plant in flower or seed so that its exact taxonomic position remained unclear until the 1900s when it was more fully described in \\"Flora Capensis\\". Nees, who first described it from sterile specimens in 1841 in his elaboration of the Gramineae of South Africa, thought it close to Nastus, and named it Nastus tessellata. Compton found it, at Bulunga Poort southeast of Manzini and at Tulwane, in Swaziland during his 1955-66 botanical survey of that country. In 1982 Thomas Robert Soderstrom and Roger Pearson Ellis revised its classification and placed it with 5 other species in Thamnocalamus.

A Democrat, Napton served as the state's 4th Attorney General, and multiple terms on the Missouri Supreme Court. Early life William Barclay Napton was born March 23, 1808 in Princeton, New Jersey to parents John and Susan Barclay (Hight) Napton.Phillips, Christopher and Pendleton, Jason L. The Union on Trial: The Political Journals of Judge William Barclay Napton, University of Missouri Press, 2005 Napton's father was a moderately successful tailor, enough so that as the oldest son William received private tutoring before enrollment in Princeton and Lawrenceville (New Jersey) preparatory academies. Napton then entered Princeton College in 1824 at the age of sixteen as a Junior, his previous studies and knack for Latin and Greek languages allowing him to bypass his freshman and sophomore years.Christensen, Lawrence O. Dictionary of Missouri Biography, University of Missouri Press, 1999, pp. 568-569. Following his graduation in 1826 Napton moved to Albemarle County, Virginia where he was employed as a tutor for the children of General William F. Gordon for a period of two years. He then studied Law at the University of Virginia, earning his degree in 1830. After graduation Napton found the abundance of lawyers in the Charlottesville, Virginia made finding work as an attorney difficult, so for two years he and a University of Virginia classmate operated Mudwell Academy, a college preparatory school. Napton entered the Virginia Bar in 1831, but the next year moved to Missouri. Settling briefly in Columbia, William Napton soon moved to the Howard County town of Fayette, then a hotbed of Missouri politics. As in Charlottesville, Napton found establishing a law practice, especially as a newcomer, difficult. However he had quickly made powerful friends in Democratic politics, including former Missouri Governor John Miller, Meredith Miles Marmaduke and Dr. John Sappington. This group, collectively known as the \\"Central Clique\\" --Jacksonian Democrats and acolytes of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton‚Äîdominated the states politics in pre-Civil War times. At their urging Napton started a newspaper, the Boon's Lick Democrat, serving as editor.Historical, Pictorial, & Biographical Record of Chariton County, Missouri, Pictorial and Biographical Publishing Co., Salisbury Missouri, 1896. On March 27, 1836 Napton married Melinda Williams, daughter of Tennessee Supreme Court justice Thomas Lanier Williams. An aside, Melinda Napton's father was the namesake of Thomas Lanier Williams III, better known as writer and playwright Tennessee Williams. Napton and his wife would eventually become parents of ten living children, nine boys and one girl. Politics With the assistance of his politically powerful friends in the Central Clique, William Napton was elected secretary of the Missouri State Senate in September, 1834, a position he held concurrently with his duties at the newspaper. His backers also saw to it that the Boon's Lick Democrat was awarded lucrative contracts to print many state manuals and documents. In December 1836 Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs, another Clique member, appointed Napton the state's fourth Attorney General, replacing Robert W. Wells, who had resigned to take a Federal judgeship. It was a history-making time to be in Missouri government, with major issues like the Honey War‚Äîa border dispute with Iowa, the 1838 Mormon War and Governor Boggs' Executive Order 44 in the forefront. Other than to offer the Governor requested opinions on the constitutionality of certain measures however, Napton's time as Attorney General was relatively unremarkable. In January, 1839 William Napton was appointed to the Missouri Supreme Court by Governor Boggs. Napton served nearly 25 years on the court, albeit not consecutively, and his total tenure ranks fifth on the list of time served. During his first period on the court, from 1839 to 1851, Judge Napton and the other justices were presented with multiple cases pertaining to the freedom of slaves. A slave holder himself, Napton held strong pro-slavery opinions and favored overturning earlier and lesser courts rulings that might free the slaves in the state. He and Justice James Harvey Birch, held the view that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that the U.S. Congress lacked the legal power to legislate slavery in territorial areas. Due to a change in Missouri law in 1851, Supreme Court justices were elected instead of appointed, and Napton was defeated in his first election. This was due in large part to a split among the Missouri Democratic party over the expansion of slavery. Senator Thomas Hart Benton and a faction of \\"free soil\\" followers felt slavery should be curtailed in new territories while Napton's pro-slavery faction were against anything of the sort. In 1849 pro-slavery Democrats had Napton author a series of instructions for the state's representatives in Washington D.C. These instructions came to be known as the \\"Jackson Resolutions\\", for Claiborne Fox Jackson an ardent pro-slavery Democrat who sponsored them in the Missouri Senate. Fallout from this party split cost both Napton and Benton their positions. Following his 1851 election defeat, and with a large family to support, William Napton became a circuit lawyer, traveling throughout the state but mainly the counties along the Missouri River. Still though Napton remained a leader in the pro-slaver faction of Missouri Democrats. In 1855 he was one of the principal organizers of the Proslavery Convention held in Lexington. Over 200 delegates, mostly from the western part of the state, gathered there to create a series of resolutions that advocated the position of states rights held by many slave holding southern states. This conference would set the stage for Napton's return to the Missouri Supreme Court, being elected handily in August, 1857. William Napton's second term on the high court lasted until December, 1861. At that time he was removed from the bench for refusing to swear an allegiance oath to the Union. Two months earlier a strongly pro-Union provisional government seized control of the state after Federal forces occupied Jefferson City, exiling Claiborne Jackson and pro-Confederate members of the state legislature. The provisional government then set about securing the loyalty oaths of those remaining. In addition to Napton, Justices Ephraim B. Ewing and William Scott, among others, refused the oath. The ensuing war years were hard on Napton and his family, with harassment both verbal and physical by Federal militia and pro-Union officials. One apocryphal story involved Napton being dragged from Elkhill, his Saline County farm, by a noose around his neck. Only intervention by a pro-Union official who had remained a Napton friend prevented his hanging. Another apocryphal story connected with the tragic death of Napton's wife Melinda. Federal troops searching for hidden weapons on the Napton property caused the pregnant Mrs. Napton to faint and fall. In fact, a few weeks later, on December 31, 1862, she died during childbirth along with the infant, the couple's tenth son. Following his wife's death William Napton moved to St. Louis, Missouri and once again took up his law practice. Most of his journals and personal papers from the era were destroyed later, so little is known of Napton's activities during the Civil War period. Two of his sons did however serve with Confederate forces. Arrested by Federal troops in St. Louis, he was not allowed to begin his law practice until he swore the loyalty oath that had cost Napon his Supreme Court position. This time, with his wife dead, Saline County farm in ruins, and nearly bankrupt Napton reluctantly agreed. His law practice in St. Louis proved lucrative by the late 1860s, and he again found himself involved in state politics. This led, in June 1873 to Napton's third and final appointment to the Missouri Supreme Court. Initially appointed to fill the term of Justice Ephraim B. Ewing, who died suddenly, Napton was elected to the court in his own right the following year by over fifty thousand votes. His health increasingly poor, Napton retired from the court rather than run for another six-year term in 1880. Napton lived out the remaining years of his life at Elkhill, his home in Saline County, which had been rebuilt with the help of one of his sons. William Barclay Napton died January 8, 1883. He was buried next to his wife on the family farm. Napton is the namesake of the community of Napton, Missouri.

Tommy Lee Jones and Matthew Fox star in lead roles as General Douglas MacArthur and Brigadier General Bonner Fellers respectively. Plot Brigadier-General Bonner Fellers is sent to Japan as a part of the occupation force. He is tasked with arresting Japanese war criminals, including Former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. Before he departs, he privately orders his Japanese interpreter, Takahashi, to locate his Japanese girlfriend, Aya Shimada. After arresting Tojo, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur informs Fellers that Emperor Hirohito can't be tried as a war criminal. Doing so could lead to a revolt, but the American people want the Emperor to stand trial for Japan's actions. MacArthur gives Fellers ten days to investigate the Emperor. When Takahashi informs Fellers that Aya's Tokyo apartment was bombed, he orders him to investigate her hometown, Shizuoka. Fellers and his staff compile a list of people who advised Emperor Hirohito when the war started. None of the Japanese who are friendly to the Americans are among them and they resort to Tojo for more information. He gives them the name of Fumimaro Konoe, the former prime minister. Fellers then asks Konoe's if the Emperor was responsible for starting the war and Konoe gives no conclusive evidence, but directs Fellers to K≈çichi Kido, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. While Fellers waits to meet with Kido, Takahashi informs Fellers Kido will not show up. Fellers soon after recalls his 1940 visit to Tokyo when he reunited with Aya, then an English teacher. He learns Aya returned to Japan after her father became ill and died. After a banquet at MacArthur's residence, Takahashi informs Fellers that Shizuoka was bombed; Fellers immediately travels there. He is devastated by the damage and orders Takahashi to find a list of the dead. Fellers recalls his visit to Aya's uncle, General Kajima, for help with a paper on the mindset of the Japanese soldier. Kajima insists if the United States and Japan were at war, the Japanese would win because of the Japanese soldier's sense of duty to the Emperor. When Fellers returns to Tokyo, he decides he must interview Teizabur≈ç Sekiya, a member of the Privy Council. Sekiya, like Konoe, does not give any evidence to exonerate the Emperor. During Fellers' interview with Kido, he discusses the time before the Japanese surrender. The Supreme Council's deadlock between those in favour of surrender and those who were not led the Emperor to address the Council. Because there were strong militarists in the Imperial Army, the Emperor made an audio recording of his order to surrender. Before the recording could be broadcast, the militarists attempted a coup and attacked the Imperial Palace. The Emperor and Kido survived and broadcast the recording. Unfortunately for Fellers, the other witnesses committed suicide and all records were destroyed, leaving him only with Kido's testimony. Kido informs Fellers the Emperor's role is, in actuality, a ceremonial one and the Emperor was influential in ending the war. Fellers decides to visit General Kajima, who has survived the war. Kajima explains to Fellers that the Japanese people are selfless and capable of great sacrifice as well as unspeakable crimes because of their strong devotion to their cultural values. Kajima does not know if the Emperor is guilty, but he notes his role in ending the war. He gives Fellers a box of folded letters written by Aya to Fellers and learns Aya died in an Allied bombing raid. Fellers concludes it cannot be determined whether the Emperor is guilty or innocent, but his role in ending the war was significant. He gives his conclusion to MacArthur, who is displeased because of the lack of conclusive evidence. Fellers argues the Emperor should be exonerated as the Allies agreed they would allow Japan to keep him as the head of state. MacArthur orders Fellers to arrange a meeting between him and the Emperor. Before the Emperor arrives, Fellers informs MacArthur of his role in diverting Allied bombers away from Shizuoka.

Release The film premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival and saw a limited release in the United States on March 8, 2013. Producer Gary Foster, Matthew Fox and Tommy Lee Jones attended a Japanese premiere along with several Japanese actors and actresses on July 18, 2013, preceding its opening in the cinemas nationwide in Japan on July 27. Reception The film received mostly negative reviews, with only a 31% rating based on 86 reviews at the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus: \\"Despite a typically strong performance from Tommy Lee Jones, Emperor does little with its fascinating historical palate, and is instead bogged down in a clich√©d romantic subplot\\".Emperor - Rotten Tomatoes The film also contains at least one major historical inaccuracy. At the beginning, before the titles, preparations are shown (via documentary footage) for the atomic bomb raid dated '6 August 1945', according to the on-screen graphics. On this date, Hiroshima was bombed, with the 'Little Boy' bomb. But the footage clearly shows the 'Fat Man' bomb being loaded, flown and dropped on Nagasaki. This raid took place 3 days later, on August 9, 1945.

It was developed for use as a planning tool, for example for the establishment of a National Reserve System Thus the Noongar people, occupying the South Western Coastal Division Number VI, circumcising cultures of the Yamatji people are associated with the Indian Ocean Division Number VII, the Kimberley peoples with the Timor Sea Division Number VIII and the Desert Groups of the Interior are associated with the Western Plateau Division Number VIII. Within these broad areas of cultural similarity smaller traditional cultures were closely adapted to the requirements of a bioregion, as it was from these sites that Aboriginal people drew their sustenance. Thus for example, the Binjareb people took their name from Binjar, a Noongar word meaning wetland and made extensive use of these and the surrounding tuart banksia woodlands of the Perth Coastal Plain. Throughout Western Australia, Aboriginal people were not just passive recipients of the bounty of these natural environments, but actively took a role in the creation and maintenance of these biogeographic regions, through hunting practices, firestick farming,Jones, R. 1969. Fire-stick Farming. Australian Natural History, 16:224 fish trapping and other means that broadly maintained the flora and fauna of their region. Post-contact cultures Aboriginal traditional cultures have been greatly impacted since the settlement of Australia by Europeans. During the late 19th and early 20th century it was assumed that Australian Aborigines were a dying race, and would eventually disappear. Aboriginal populations in Western Australia did decline until the 1930s, after which time numbers have increased. Today, all Aboriginal cultures have been impacted by degrees of marginalisation and exclusion from participation in the dominant culture of Australia. Given this declaration, Elkin states that this represents an adaption of \\"intelligent parasitism\\" of white culture. This has resulted in higher than average rates of infant mortality, and lower rates of life expectancy, education and employment.

The agency is administered by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. , there are 7,944,315 valid Ohio driver's licenses and 861,043 Ohio identification cards in the state. History On May 19, 1902, Cleveland became one of the first cities in the country to require motorists to display government-issued registration numbers on their vehicles. In 1906, the state attempted to take over auto registration under the Ward Automobile Law, but litigation delayed the program until the state Supreme Court ruled in favor of the law. The Secretary of State's Automobile Division was established in 1907. The Ward Law went into effect on June 11, 1908, but the Automobile Division did not begin issuing plates for another 30 days due to a manufacturing defect. The first state vehicle registration was issued to Cincinnati resident Thomas B. Paxton, Jr., for his Franklin automobile. Locally issued and owner-provided license plates were phased out by 1909 for automobiles, but local plates continued to be used for motorcycles until 1914. In 1925, the Automobile Division was renamed the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, and the Registrar of Motor Vehicles was retitled the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. In 1933, the Bureau was transferred to the newly created Ohio Department of Highways. In 1935, the Commissioner title was reverted to Registrar. On May 19, 1953, Amended House Bill 243 created the Ohio Department of Highway Safety and transferred the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and State Highway Patrol to the new department, effective October 2, 1953. Deputy registrars were political appointees until November 28, 1988, when a private request for proposal process took effect. The BMV's parent agency was renamed the Department of Public Safety in September 1992.

They have been noted for their energetic live performances and experimental sound, which combines elements from such genres as Chicago house music, neo-soul, rock and electro-funk. History The group was formed in the fall of 2008, when Men, Women & Children keyboardist Nick Hook met singer Tiombe Lockhart at a sake bar he worked at. The pair became friends and decided to work on music together. They were joined by keyboardist/percussionist Daud Sturdivant, who worked at the same bar, and Hook's then-bandmate guitarist Todd Weinstock to form Cubic Zirconia. The first release from the group arrived on June 22, 2009 in the form of Fuck Work EP and featured the likes of D√¢m-Funk, Dances with White Girls and Nacho Lovers remixing the title track. Later that year Weinstock left Cubic Zirconia to produce other artists as part of Social Security and play guitar in Hussle Club and Gina and The Eastern Block. The remaining members of the group spent the late 2009 recording their debut album in Los Angeles. In 2010 Cubic Zirconia released singles \\"Josephine\\", \\"Black & Blue\\" and \\"Hoes Come Out at Night\\" on their own label Don't Cry Recordings, and announced that their debut full-length record, entitled Follow Your Heart would be released in February 2011 via LuckyMe Records.

From left to right: Brazilian football legend Pel√©, Vice-President of Brazil Michel Temer, UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Olympic double gold medallist Mo Farah The 2012 Olympic hunger summit was an international gathering on 12 August, the closing day of the 2012 Summer Olympics, held at 10 Downing Street London. The event was organised largely by the Department for International Development. It was co-hosted by Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, and by Brazil's vice president Michel Temer. The summit was attended by several high-profile athletes and by delegates from various national governments, the United Nations, NGOs and from the private sector. Since World War II, there had been uneven but substantial progress in reducing the number of people suffering from hunger. Yet in 2007, this progress was thrown into reverse, with the numbers rising as a result of lasting inflation to the price of food. The purpose of the summit was to raise awareness and activity in tackling the problem of world hunger and to announce various concrete initiatives. The event was broadly though cautiously welcomed by aid agencies. It is part of a wider international intensification of efforts to address the problem of hunger. Background Gold medal winner Greg Rutherford, one of the athletes who urged David Cameron to use Britains 2013 presidency of the G8 to make the fight against hunger and malnutrition a top priority issue. The Summit is part of a series of international efforts which have sought to respond to the \\"return of hunger\\" as a high-profile global issue. While the problem of hunger had always remained a pressing concern for hundreds of millions of people, the previous few decades leading up to 2007 had seen considerable progress in reducing the number of people suffering from the condition. The Green Revolution of the 1960s and 70s had helped propagate improved agricultural technology throughout the world. Progress had been uneven, yet the years that followed generally saw a reduction in the number of people suffering from hunger both as a percentage of the total world population and even in absolute terms. At the turn of the century, estimates from the World Bank suggested that the numbers suffering from chronic hunger had been reduced to close to 800 million, and the Millennium Development Goals included a commitment to achieve a further 50% reduction by 2015. By 2008 it was apparent that meeting this goal would be challenging - the numbers suffering from hunger had stopped falling, rising due to the lasting global inflation in the price of food which began in late 2006. In 2008, a global food crisis saw food riots breaking out in dozens of countries, with governments toppled in Haiti and Madagascar. By 2009, World Bank figures suggested the numbers suffering from chronic hunger had increased to just over a billion. Since the L'Aquila Food Security Initiative which was launched at the July 2009 G8 Summit, hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the advanced economies.Whereas prior to the L'Aquila Initiative, interest was mainly restricted to the governments of the worst affected developing countries, multilateral organizations and NGOs. 2009 also saw the lunch of the UN's Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) programme, which has developed into a global movement led principally by developing nations.SUN was one of the initiatives that the olympic hunger summit aimed to draw attention to: Scaling up Nutrition home page SUN aims to address the issue of nutrition as well as raw hunger. As a response to the global food crises which began in 2007, some regions have raised production of drought and pest resistant crops such as Cassava. While good for providing raw calories, the crop has limited nutritional value and some strains even have anti-nutritional factors if not cooked properly. Millions of children who do not receive adequate nutrition are at risk of permanent stunted growth, even if they are eating a normal amount of calories. The second global food crisis of the 21st century began in late 2010; the 2011 East Africa drought followed shortly afterwards. By mid-2012, the 2012 US drought and a weak Indian monsoon had raised fears of a possible third global food crisis. David Cameron announced his intention to hold the Olympic hunger summit in May 2012, a few days after President Barack Obama had launched the \\"new alliance for food security and nutrition\\" at the 2012 G8 Summit. British NGOs such as ONE and Save the children had expressed the view that it would be good if Mr Cameron could contribute to the international momentum building to tackle hunger and malnutrition; Britain is due to assume the presidency of the G8 in 2013. Just prior to the summit, Cameron was further urged to do this by a group of athletes in an open letter.

Announcements A commitment was made to reduce the number of children left stunted by malnourishment by as much as 25 million prior to the 2016 Olympics, with the EU alone taking responsibility for reducing the number by 7 million. India is doubling their budget for improving nutrition and health, which could affect 100 million women and children. The Children's Investment Fund Foundation announced a multimillion-pound annual investment to reduce stunting and malnutrition. The UN's World Food Programme is to provide assistance for Rwandan farmers to grow iron-rich beans for emergency food relief. Private sector companies including Unilever, Syngenta and GSK undertook to improving the affordability of nutritious food in poor regions. Britain will fund research into crops that are both drought-resistant and rich in nutrients, as well as research into nutritious seeds and tubers, such as the sweet potato.Going for Gold: Orange Sweet Potato and the Olympic Hunger Summit As is common at international summits, most or all of these initiatives had already been decided in advance, and several of them had already been announced. Reception The summit has been broadly welcomed by aid agencies. Justin Forsyth, CEO of Save the Children, wrote that the boost provided by the summit to the fight against hunger could turn out to be the \\"real legacy\\" of the 2012 games. Molly Kinder, director for Agriculture and European policy at ONE, told The Guardian she was impressed with the substantive nature of the Summit's outcome, and especially with the EU committing to a specific target, something they rarely do. There has however been concern that the partnerships with big private sector players may distract from the role other large Corporations sometimes have in aggravating hunger, by manipulating global markets to their advantage, and in some cases by purchasing large areas of land in African countries and then driving small holders from their farms. George Monbiot says the summit may distract from the West's role in worsening hunger by setting targets that cause arable lands to be used to produce bio fuel instead of food. Writing just before the summit, British food bank network The Trussell Trust warned that attention is also needed for the growing problem of domestic hunger within Britain, where millions are now suffering from food insecurity.

Active redundancy can be integrated with fault reporting to reduce down time to a few minutes per year. * Passive redundancy * Active redundancy History Formal maintenance philosophies are required by organizations whose primary responsibility is to ensure systems are ready when expected, such as space agencies and military. Labor-intensive planned maintenance began during the rise of the industrial revolution. This depends upon periodic diagnostic evaluation based upon calendar dates, distance, or use. The intent is to accomplish diagnostic evaluations that indicate when maintenance is required to prevent inconvenience and safety issues that will occur when critical equipment failures occur during use. The electronic revolution allowed inexpensive sensors and controls to be integrated into most equipment. This includes diagnostic indicators, fluid sensors, temperature sensors, ignition sensors, exhaust monitoring, voltage sensors, and similar monitoring equipment that indicates when maintenance is required. Sensor displays are often located in inaccessible locations that cannot be observed during normal operation. Labor- intensive periodic maintenance is often required to inspect indicators. Some organizations have eliminated most labor-intensive periodic maintenance and diagnostic down time by implementing designs that bring all sensor status to fault indicators located in close proximity to users.  Principle  Maintenance requires three actions. * Fault discovery * Fault isolation * Fault recovery Fault discovery requires diagnostic maintenance, which requires system down time and labor costs. Down time and cost requirements associated with diagnostics are eliminated for every item that satisfies the following criteria. * Automated diagnostic * Instrumented for remote viewing * Displayed in the viscidity of supervisory personnel Implementation Fault reporting is an optional feature that can be forwarded to remote displays using simple configuration setting in all modern computing equipment. The system level of reporting that is appropriate for Condition Based Maintenance are critical, alert, and emergency, which indicate software termination due to failure. Specific failure reporting, like interface failure, can be integrated into applications linked with these reporting systems. There is no development cost if these are incorporated into designs. * Syslog * Event Log * Power distribution unit Other kinds of fault reporting involves painting green, yellow, and red zones onto temperature gages, pressure gages, flow gages, vibration sensors, strain gages, and similar sensors. Remote viewing can be implemented using a video camera. = Benefits = The historical approach for Fault discovery is periodic diagnostic testing, which eliminates the following operational availability penalty. :Availability \\\\ Reduction = \\\\frac{ Total \\\\ Time }{Total \\\\ Time + Maintenance \\\\ Down \\\\ Time } Fault reporting eliminates maintenance costs associated manual diagnostic testing. :Diagnostic \\\\ Cost = Maintenance \\\\ Down \\\\ Time \\\\times Labor \\\\ Rate \\\\times \\\\ Team \\\\ Size Labor is eliminated in redundant designs by using the fault discovery and fault isolation functions to automatically reconfigure equipment for degraded operation. Maintenance savings can be re-allocated to upgrades and improvements that increase organizational competitiveness. = Detriments = Faults that do not trigger a sustained requirement for fault isolation and fault recovery actions should not be displayed for management action. As an example, lighting up a fault indicator in situations where human intervention is not required will induce breakage by causing maintenance personnel to perform work when nothing is already broken. As another example, enabling fault reporting for Internet network packet delivery failure will increase network loading when the network is already busy, and that will cause total network outage.

The series is chronologically the fourth series in The Shadowhunter Chronicles and a sequel to The Mortal Instruments. It is set in Los Angeles. The series consists of three books: Lady Midnight, Lord of Shadows and Queen of Air and Darkness, in that particular order. Centered around the protagonist, Emma Carstairs, the series follows her journey as a Shadowhunter at the Los Angeles Institute, and her life with her best-friend and parabatai, Julian Blackthorn, and his family. The series is about a sacred bond of \\"parabatai\\", two bonded Shadowhunters, and it is more valuable than any bond in this world. This bond makes the two more powerful and strong, but there is only one drawback - it is forbidden to fall in love with your parabatai. It so happens that Emma and Julian, two parabatai, have fallen in love. The Dark Artifices is a trilogy about their struggle against their enemies and how the two protagonists deal with their forbidden love and the resulting consequences. The series is told from the point-of-view of the various different characters in the story. Publication history # Lady Midnight (March 8, 2016) # Lord of Shadows (May 23, 2017) # Queen of Air and Darkness (December 4, 2018) Characters * Emma Carstairs (first featured in City of Heavenly Fire): Emma Carstairs is known to be the next greatest Shadowhunter, or in other words \\"the next Jace Herondale\\" (so to speak). In this book she faces a lot of tough decisions about her future while fighting for information on her parents' death. She also struggles with the question of her forbidden love. She treats the Blackthorns as her biological family and would do anything for them. She is friends with Cristina Rosales and the ex-girlfriend of Cameron Ashdown. * Julian Blackthorn (first featured in City of Lost Souls): Julian Blackthorn is Emma's parabatai and lives in the Los Angeles Institute with his siblings, his uncle Arthur and Emma. Due to Arthur's mental health, Julian runs the Institute and cares for his siblings. Julian has four younger siblings; Ty (Tiberius), Livvy (Livia), Dru (Drusilla), and Tavvy (Octavian). * Helen Blackthorn (first featured in City of Lost Souls): Helen is the eldest Blackthorn sibling. She and her brother Mark are half-fey. Helen is married to Aline Penhallow. Following the events in \\"City of Heavenly Fire\\", Helen is exiled to Wrangel Island with her wife. * Mark Blackthorn (first featured in City of Heavenly Fire): Mark Blackthorn is the older half-brother of Julian, Livia, Tiberius, Drusilla and Octavian. He is half-fey. After being given to The Wild Hunt in City of Heavenly Fire, Mark is returned to his family as a bargaining chip for Emma and the Blackthorns to solve murders involving the fey. * Cristina Mendoza Rosales: Cristina Mendoza Rosales is a Shadowhunter from the Mexico Institute, who, in her nineteenth year comes to study at the Los Angeles Institute for her travel year and becomes best friends with Emma. * Diego Roc√≠o Rosales: Emma Carstairs Diego is a Centurion and someone Cristina once loved. Also called \\"Perfect Diego.\\" Diego was in love with Cristina Rosales, and they had plans to marry while Cristina also planned to become parabatai with his younger brother, Jaime. Cristina's mother greatly approved of their union. Diego and Cristina are distant relatives. * The Blackthorn Children (Livia, Tiberius, Drusilla, Octavian) (featured in City of Heavenly Fire): Livia, Tiberius, Drusilla and Octavian are the younger siblings of Julian, Helen, and Mark. Livia and Tiberius are twins. * Magnus Bane (featured in every published The Shadowhunter Chronicles book): Magnus Bane is the High Warlock of Brooklyn and Alec Lightwood's boyfriend. * Kieran (featured in Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy): Kieran is the Prince of the Unseelie Court and a member of the Wild Hunt. * Kit Rook: Kit Rook is a Shadowhunter from a previously unknown branch of the Herondale family. * Diana Wrayburn (featured in City of Heavenly Fire): Diana Wrayburn is the tutor at the Los Angeles Institute, a job previously held by Katrina, who became an Endarkened. * Clary Fairchild (featured in every published book of The Mortal Instruments): Clarissa (Clary) Fairchild is the co-head of the New York Institute alongside her boyfriend Jace. Clary first met Emma in 2008, during the events of ‚Äò‚ÄôCity of Heavenly Fire ‚Äô‚Äô. * Jace Herondale (featured in every published book of The Mortal Instruments): Jace Herondale is the co-head of the New York Institute alongside his girlfriend Clary. * Malcom Fade (featured in City of Heavenly Fire): Malcom is a minor antagonist of the series and the High Warlock of L.A. He is close to the Blackthorns especially Annabel, who was murdered by her family for loving a warlock. Intent on getting revenge, Malcolm vowed to do anything to get her back, including murder. * Annabel Blackthorn: Annabel Blackthorn was a Shadowhunter in the early 19th century. After her family killed her for shaming them, she was resurrected by Malcolm in 2012. After she woke up, she killed him for making her suffer during his attempt to bring her back. She later also murdered Livia Blackthorn and was then kidnapped to the Unseelie Court by the Unseelie King.  Theme  The main theme developing in Cassandra Clare's The Dark Artifices series is the concept of maturing and the transition into adulthood. The conscious decision one must make between responsibility and personal desire is explored through Julian and Emma's hesitancy in Lady Midnight. The two struggle between pursuing their feelings for one another and weighing the consequences of defying Shadowhunter law, which could ultimately threaten the Blackthorn family. Clare also explores the experience of having one's beliefs challenged, and how to handle such instances. In Lady Midnight, Emma and the Blackthorns learn this the hard way when the family is betrayed by their former-friend and warlock, Malcolm Fade.

Shapiro to account for novelty created in the course of biological evolution. Shapiro developed this work in several peer-reviewed publications from 1992 onwards, and later in his 2011 book Evolution: A View from the 21st Century. He uses NGE to account for several proposed counterexamples to the central dogma of molecular biology (the subsequently partly rejected proposal of 1970 that the direction of the flow of sequence information is only from DNA to DNA or DNA to RNA to proteins, and never the reverse). Shapiro drew from work as diverse as the adaptivity of the mammalian immune system, ciliate macronuclei and epigenetics. The work gained some measure of notoriety after being championed by proponents of Intelligent Design, despite Shapiro's explicit repudiation of that movement. Concept Shapiro first laid out his ideas of natural genetic engineering in 1992 and has continued to develop them in both the primary scientific literature and in work directed to wider audiences, culminating in the 2011 publication of Evolution: A View from the 21st Century. Natural genetic engineering is a reaction against the modern synthesis and the central dogma of molecular biology. The modern synthesis was formulated before the elucidation of the double-helix structure of DNA and the establishment of molecular biology in its current status of prominence. Given what was known at the time a simple, powerful model of genetic change through undirected mutation (loosely described as \\"random\\") and natural selection, was seen as sufficient to explain evolution as observed in nature. With the discovery of the nature and roles of nucleic acids in genetics, this model prompted Francis Crick's so- called Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: \\"[Sequential] information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid.\\"Crick, F.H.C. (1958): On Protein Synthesis. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. XII, 139-163. (pdf, early draft of original article) Shapiro points out that multiple cellular systems can affect DNA in response to specific environmental stimuli. These \\"directed\\" changes stand in contrast to both the undirected mutations in the modern synthesis and (in Shapiro's interpretation) the ban on information flowing from the environment into the genome. In the 1992 Genetica paper that introduced the concept, Shapiro begins by listing three lessons from molecular genetics: * there is a surprising amount of genetic conservation across taxonomic boundaries, * the mosaic structure of the genome results in multiple nonlocal genes having multiple phylogenic effects, and, drawing on the work of his friend and collaborator Barbara McClintock, * the existence of multiple cellular mechanisms (including mobile genetic elements) that can restructure DNA. From these, Shapiro concludes: > [I]t can be argued that much of genome change in evolution results from a > genetic engineering process utilizing the biochemical systems for mobilizing > and reorganizing DNA structures present in living cells. Relation with Intelligent Design In a 1997 Boston Review article, Shapiro lists four categories of discoveries made in molecular biology that, in his estimation, are not adequately accounted for by the Modern Synthesis: genome organization, cellular repair capabilities, mobile genetic elements and cellular information processing. Shapiro concludes: > What significance does an emerging interface between biology and information > science hold for thinking about evolution? It opens up the possibility of > addressing scientifically rather than ideologically the central issue so > hotly contested by fundamentalists on both sides of the Creationist- > Darwinist debate: Is there any guiding intelligence at work in the origin of > species displaying exquisite adaptations that range from lambda prophage > repression and the Krebs cycle through the mitotic apparatus and the eye to > the immune system, mimicry, and social organization? Within the context of the article in particular and Shapiro's work on Natural Genetic Engineering in general, the \\"guiding intelligence\\" is to be found within the cell. (For example, in a Huffington Post essay entitled Cell Cognition and Cell Decision-Making Shapiro defines cognitive actions as those that are \\"knowledge-based and involve decisions appropriate to acquired information,\\" arguing that cells meet this criteria.) However, the combination of disagreement with the Modern Synthesis and discussion of a creative intelligence has brought his work to the attention of advocates of Intelligent Design. Natural genetic engineering has been cited as a legitimate scientific controversy (in contrast to the controversies raised by various branches of creationism). While Shapiro considers the questions raised by Intelligent Design to be interesting, he parts ways with creationists by considering these problems to be scientifically tractable (specifically by understanding how NGE plays a role in the evolution of novelty). With the publication of Evolution: A View from the 21st Century, Shapiro's work again came under discussion in the Intelligent design community. In a conversation with Shapiro, William Dembski asked for Shapiro's thoughts on the origins of natural genetic engineering systems. Shapiro replied that \\"where they come from in the first place is not a question we can realistically answer right now.\\" While Dembski sees this position as at least not inconsistent with Intelligent Design, Shapiro has explicitly and repeatedly rejected both creationism in general and Intelligent Design in particular. Criticism While Shapiro developed NGE in the peer-reviewed literature, the idea attracted far more attention when he summarized his work in his book Evolution: A View from the 21st Century. In part due to its discussion of the Intelligent Design movement, the book was widely and critically reviewed. Criticism falls into two main categories: :# The theory crosses the line into teleology, a line exemplified by the review written by Larry Moran. The form of Shapiro's argument has points of resemblance to several creationist arguments to the effect that observed biology cannot be explained by a combination of \\"random\\" (undirected) mutation and natural selection. One of the many standard responses to these arguments is that biology can be sufficiently explained without invoking higher causes. Shapiro's view differs significantly from that of creationists, not the least because his higher causes exist only at the level of cellular machinery. However, to a critic unpersuaded of the need for higher causes, it is not persuasive to substitute material higher causes for the supernatural. :# Shapiro does not give a fair reading of the central dogma. Shapiro's reading of the central dogma requires that only random mutations can be the root of evolutionary change. If this reading is correct, then, ignoring the looseness of such an application of the term \\"random\\", the several mechanisms identified by Shapiro (e.g., epigenetics) do indeed falsify this theory. However, Crick and geneticists in general had long been well aware of the existence of mutagens at the time of the formulation and restatement of the central dogma, and in fact before the discovery of the mechanisms of biological heredity.Morgan, Thomas Hunt. The mechanism of Mendelian heredity New York, Holt, 1915 A more conservative interpretation, in the words of Marshall Nirenberg, is simply that \\"DNA makes RNA makes protein.\\" Under this reading, proteins would not be expected to modify DNA, but Shapiro provides multiple examples of where this occurs, including histone modification, mutagenic subclasses of excision and repair enzymes, extensive regulation of mobile genetic elements, and various classes of RNA regulation, and direct modification of nucleotides via cytosine methylation and enzymatic deamination. Shapiro responded to the review in Evolutionary Intelligence.

Richardson opted to run, and faced Mark Weithorn, the husband of Miami Beach City Commissioner Deede Weithorn; Adam Kravitz, the founder of JDate; and Waldo Faura in the Democratic primary. He received 33% of the vote to Weithorn's 26%, Kravitz's 24%, and Faura's 16%, advancing to the general election, where he was elected unopposed. His victory in the general election, along with the victory of Joe Saunders that same year, allowed both Richardson and Saunders to be the first openly gay members of the state legislature. When Darryl Rouson, who was set to serve as the Democratic floor leader in the Florida House of Representatives for the 2014-2016 legislative term, created an independent fundraising committee independent of the state party apparatus, Richardson called for Rouson to resign from his position in a letter sent to members of the caucus. Richardson ended up making a motion to vacate Rouson's position, which was seconded and then passed, resulting in a new election for the position. In 2014, Richardson was re-elected to his second term in the legislature without opposition. In a district that is 60% Hispanic, he received over 64% of the vote in 2016. In 2017, when running for the 2018-2020 leadership of the house minority caucus, he withdrew from the race, recommending that the party pick between two other leading candidates to insure greater delegation unity.Richardson withdraws from the 2018 House Democratic Leader race, Miami Herald, Mary Ellen Klas, March 7, 2017.

Oversight of state agencies During the 2013 legislative session, Richardson authored legislation that would appoint an Inspector General to look over the affairs of the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, declaring, \\"After learning of severe managerial shortcomings at Citizens, including reports of lavish spending on travel, reports of severance packages for employees who had faced abuse charges, and unprofessional behavior of staff, I immediately recognized the need for stronger state oversight.\\" Richardson made frequent surprise visits over a year and a half to the Gadsden Correctional Facility, which holds over 1,500 women. On his initial visit, he found many of the classrooms without teachers, others without required supplies, and he was determined to return. A 2004 audit, Report Number 2005-61, by the Florida Department of Management Services (DMS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found CCA had been paid $2,850,000 more for Gadsden's facility physical upkeep than it ultimately spent for repairs, and that the state was jointly overcharged by $13 million paid to its contractors, CCA and GEO Group for private prison operations.CASE NO.

He found its inmates had endured months deprived of heat and hot water, found their bathrooms flooded every day, and were subjected to water rationing because the sewage system was malfunctioning. Though the facility had received approval of a $10,000 state funded expenditure for a new water heater, its warden never bothered to authorize the replacement. MTC spokesman Issa Arnita acknowledged that management a year earlier, became ‚Äú...aware of hot water issues at the facility.\\" He said, \\"While we‚Äôve made short-term fixes, the entire system will ultimately need to be replaced.‚Äù On February 23, 2017, Richardson returned for a scheduled visit accompanied by two other legislators and the director of the DMS which is responsible for overseeing the performance of and conditions within private prisons. In the two days before their arrival, institution work crews finally addressed many of the long backlogged 495 repair orders. The state quickly replaced its on-site monitor. When Richardson returned with two investigators from the Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) as requested by the state's DMS OIG, other problems emerged at the prison. Although prisoners said they had been intimidated against complaining to inspectors and feared retribution, one had sent Richardson a detailed list of 23 serious plumbing problems in just a single housing unit.Private prison deprived inmates of heat and hot water for months, lawmaker finds, Miami Herald, Mary Ellen Klas, February 25, 2017.

Prior to this, Richardson had made a name for himself as a voluble and respected critic regarding the mismanagement of state bureaucracies, particularly within both the public and for-profit sectors of corrections.

Definition Operational availability is a management concept that evaluates the following. * Diagnostic down time * Criticality * Fault isolation down time * Logistics delay down time * Corrective maintenance down time Any failed item that is not corrected will induce operational failure. A_o is used to evaluate that risk. Operational failure is unacceptable in any situation where the following can occur. * Capital equipment loss * Injury or loss of life * Sustained failure to accomplish mission In military acquisition, operational availability is used as one of the Key Performance Parameters in requirements documents, to form the basis for decision support analyses. History Aircraft systems, ship systems, missile systems, and space systems have a large number of failure modes that must be addressed with limited resources. Formal reliability modeling during development is required to prioritize resource allocation before operation begins. Estimated failure rates and logistics delay are used to identify the number of forward positioned spare parts required to avoid excessive down time. This is also used to justify the expense associated with redundancy. Formal availability measurement is used during operation to prioritize management decisions involving upgrade resource allocation, manpower allocation, and spare parts planning.  Principle  Operational availability is used to evaluate the following performance characteristic. For a system that is expected to be available constantly, the below operational availability figures translate to the system being unavailable for approximately the following lengths of time (when all outages during a year are added together): : A_o = 0.9 \\\\approx 877 \\\\ hours \\\\ down \\\\ time \\\\ per \\\\ year : A_o = 0.99 \\\\approx 87 \\\\ hours \\\\ down \\\\ time \\\\ per \\\\ year : A_o = 0.999 \\\\approx 8 \\\\ hours \\\\ down \\\\ time \\\\ per \\\\ year : A_o = 0.9999 \\\\approx 52 \\\\ minutes \\\\ down \\\\ time \\\\ per \\\\ year : A_o = 0.99999 \\\\approx 5 \\\\ minutes \\\\ down \\\\ time \\\\ per \\\\ year The following data is collected for maintenance actions while in operation to prioritize corrective funding. * Diagnostic down time is required to identify the amount of time spent perform maintenance when fault reporting does not support condition-based maintenance. * Criticality identifies level of risk associated with loss of mission, injury or loss of life, and capitol equipment. * Fault isolation down time is required to identify the amount of time spent locating a failure. * Logistics delay down time is required to identify the amount of time required to obtain replacement parts or software. * Corrective maintenance down time is required to identify the amount of time required to install and reconfigure replacement parts and software. This data is applied to the reliability block diagram to evaluate individual availability reduction contributions using the following formulas. :A_{o}^{D} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{ Total \\\\ Time }{Total \\\\ Time + Diagnostic \\\\ Down \\\\ Time } \\\\right) :A_{o}^{FI} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{ Total \\\\ Time }{Total \\\\ Time + Fault \\\\ Isolation \\\\ Down \\\\ Time } \\\\right) :A_{o}^{L} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{ Total \\\\ Time }{Total \\\\ Time + Logistics \\\\ Down \\\\ Time } \\\\right) :A_{o}^{C} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{ Total \\\\ Time }{Total \\\\ Time + Corrective \\\\ Down \\\\ Time } \\\\right) Redundant items do not contribute to availability reduction unless all of the redundant components fail simultaneously.

This concept is related to condition-based maintenance and fault reporting. History The initial requirement began with military combat systems during World War I. The approach used for survivability was to install thick armor plate to resist gun fire and install multiple guns. This became unaffordable and impractical during the Cold War when aircraft and missile systems became common. The new approach was to build distributed systems that continue to work when components are damaged. This depends upon very crude forms of artificial intelligence that perform reconfiguration by obeying specific rules. An example of this approach is the AN/UYK-43 computer. Formal design philosophies involving active redundancy are required for critical systems where corrective labor is undesirable or impractical to correct failure during normal operation. Commercial aircraft are required to have multiple redundant computing systems, hydraulic systems, and propulsion systems so that a single in-flight equipment failure will not cause loss of life. A more recent outcome of this work is the Internet, which relies on a backbone of routers that provide the ability to automatically re-route communication without human intervention when failures occur. Satellites placed into orbit around the earth must include massive active redundancy to ensure operation will continue for a decade or longer despite failures induced by normal failure, radiation-induced failure, and thermal shock. This strategy now dominates space systems, aircraft, and missile systems.  Principle  Maintenance requires three actions, which usually involve down time and high priority labor costs: * Automatic fault detection * Automatic fault isolation * Automatic reconfiguration Active redundancy eliminates down time and reduces manpower requirements by automating all three actions. This requires some amount of automated artificial intelligence. N stands for needed equipment. The amount of excess capacity affects overall system reliability by limiting the effects of failure. For example, if it takes two generators to power a city, then \\"N+1\\" would be three generators to allow a single failure. Similarly, \\"N+2\\" would be four generators, which would allow one generator to fail while a second generator has already failed. Active redundancy improves operational availability as follows. :A_{o}^{N} = 0.99 \\\\ up \\\\ time :::\\\\approx failed \\\\ 90 \\\\ hours/year :A_{o}^{N+1} = 1 - \\\\left( (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \\\\times (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \\\\right) = 0.9999 \\\\ up \\\\ time ::::\\\\approx failed \\\\ 50 \\\\ minutes/year :A_{o}^{N+2} = 1 - \\\\left( (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \\\\times (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \\\\times (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \\\\right) = 0.999999 \\\\ up \\\\ time ::::\\\\approx failed \\\\ 30 \\\\ seconds/year =Passive components= Active redundancy in passive components requires redundant components that share the burden when failure occurs, like in cabling and piping. This allows forces to be redistributed across a bridge to prevent failure if a vehicle ruptures a cable. This allows water flow to be redistributed through pipes when a limited number of valves are shut or pumps shut down. =Active components= Active redundancy in active components requires reconfiguration when failure occurs. Computer programming must recognize the failure and automatically reconfigure to restore operation. All modern computers provide the following when an existing feature is enabled via fault reporting. * Automatic fault detection * Automatic fault isolation Mechanical devices must reconfigure, such as transmission settings on hybrid vehicles that have redundant propulsion systems. The petroleum engine will start up when battery power fails. Electrical power systems must perform two actions to prevent total system failure when smaller failures occur, such as when a tree falls across a power line. Power systems incorporate communication, switching, and automatic scheduling that allows these actions to be automated. * Shut down the damaged power line to isolate the failure * Adjust generator settings to prevent voltage and frequency excursions  Benefits  This is the only known strategy that can achieve high availability.  Detriments  This maintenance philosophy requires custom development with extra components.

The venue of the conference was Al Safa Palace. Background The summit was organised in response to the increased violence as a result of the Syrian Civil War. Participants Nearly all member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation took part in the summit. However, Syria was not invited to participate in the conference. Amongst the participants were host leader king Abdullah, Turkish president Abdullah Gul, Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, Jordan's king Abdullah, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, Qatari emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, Yemeni president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, Palestine's Mahmoud Abbas, Malaysia's Najib Razak, Sudan's Omar al-Bashir, Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai, Tunisian president Moncef Marzouki, Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari and Bangladesh's Zillur Rahman. Discussions Discussions centred on Syria and preventing the spread of sectarian unrest that began to be experienced in the region. The king of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah, proposed the establishment of a center for dialogue in order to address the sectarian unrest in the region. It was reported that the center would be established in Riyadh. During the summit, Abdullah called for a dialogue among eight sects: the Sunni Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and the Shia Ja'fari, Zaidi, al-Abazi and al-Zahiri, which exist in the Persian Gulf region, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen and Iraq. Conclusion On 16 August 2012, the summit was closed with a call for more unity among Muslim countries and the need to avoid divisive tendencies. The joint decision of the summit was the suspension of Syria's membership. This move was opposed by Iran and Algeria. Both the proposal to establish a dialogue center and its planned headquarter were included in the closing statement of the summit. The closing statement also focused on the question of Palestine, stating it as the central cause of the Islamic Ummah. =Reactions= Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign and Expatriates Minister Walid Muallem stated that the decision over the suspension of Syria's membership was a clear violation of the OIC's charter. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi argued in Mecca on 16 August 2012 that the suspension was an unjust move and that Iran did not support this decision. The U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland commented that the decision over the suspension supports the Syrians and their struggles, and increases the international isolation of the Assad government.

It was the Spanish response to Dutch settlements being built in Formosa, now known as Taiwan. In cooperation with the Portuguese, this venture was made to attract Chinese traders and curtail the expansion of Dutch power in Asia. Background As part of its campaign in Asia, the Dutch East India Company attempted to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622, but were driven off by the Ming authorities. In 1624, the Company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on the coastal islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan. David Wright, a Scottish agent of the Company who lived on the island in the 1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11 chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under Dutch control while others remained independent. The Company began to import laborers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores), many of whom settled. Expedition Location of Keelung, Taiwan On 5 May 1626, the first Spanish landing on Formosa, as ordered by Governor-General of the Philippines Fern√°ndo de Silva, was at Cape San Diego, but they decided that the area was not suitable for defense. So, the Spanish continued westwards along the coast until they arrived at Keelung. A deep and well-protected harbor, including a small island in the mouth of the harbor, made it the ideal spot to build the first settlement, which they named Santisima Trinidad. Forts were built, both on the island and on the harbor itself. It was garrisoned by hundreds of Spanish and Filipino soldiers from the Philippines. The colony was designed to protect Spanish and Portuguese trade from interference by the Dutch base in the south of Taiwan. Aftermath Fort San Domingo was built by the Spanish in 1629 at Tamsui after which the present site of the Fort was named in order to bolster the success of establishing Spanish power in Formosa. On a night in 1636, a group of local people, angered by the taxes that the Spanish governor had imposed, successfully attacked the fort and demolished it. In 1637, the Spanish rebuilt the fort using stone and raised the height of the walls to twenty feet or more. However, in August 1642, the Dutch returned to Keelung with four large ships, several smaller ships, and with approximately 369 Dutch soldiers. A combination of Spaniards, aboriginals, and Pampangos from the Philippines held off troops for six days, they eventually returned to Manila defeated, and gave up their flags and what little artillery remained with them. Sebasti√°n Hurtado de Corcuera, governor of the Philippines, was originally to blame for the loss of the Formosa and was eventually tried in court for his actions, and was imprisoned for five years in the Philippines. Historians since Corcuera's time have chastised him for the loss of the Formosa, but other factors, such as the continuing rise of the Dutch Empire in Southeast Asia, and financial troubles within the Spanish Empire, were also contributing factors.

Headquartered in France, it has an international presence. The company was established in 1918 and was public from 1924 to 1995 and again from 2004 to 2016 when it became a subsidiary of oil company Total. History AA) lithium-thionyl chloride cell with a matchstick for scale. =Beginnings= The Soci√©t√© des Accumulateurs Fixes et de Traction (SAFT) was founded in 1918, mainly by Victor H√©rold, which since 1913 had been manufacturing batteries for the luggage carts that were used in railway stations and for the lighting of the locomotives from the Paris-Lyon-Marseille Company (PLM). In 1924, the company was partially listed on the Paris Bourse. In 1928, the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Electrique (Alcatel) purchased it. In 1949, it introduced a new type of alkaline battery. The company widened its range of activities and markets, including power plants, telephone systems and industries in general. It introduced a revolutionary manufacturing system for sintered plates, which had a great impact in the aeronautic field. In 1953, the US Naval Air Command requested 2000 batteries of 24 V. The contract with the US military was of US$ in dollars. In 1980, together with PSA, Saft conducted a study to evaluate the potential of using batteries to power electric cars. During the next years, the investment was focused on built a sophisticated robotic assembly line. =Global growth= Global locations of Saft factories in 2012. In the 1940s, Saft opened a subsidiary in the United Kingdom and, in the 1970s, one in the United States. In the 1980s, the company settled in Singapore and continued its expansion. It became the leading manufacturer of nickel-cadmium batteries both in the aviation sector and in the railway sector. In 1995, Alcatel delisted the company from the stock market and acquired a 100 percent of its shares. Later, Saft purchased Nife and Alcad, its main rivals, as well as the Czech company Ferak. In 2001 it suffered a setback and sold facilities in South Korea and Mexico. The same year it acquired from Invensys plc the American company Hawker Eternacell, a leading provider of lithium batteries to the American and British armed forces. It also took control of the American company ASB and Sonnenschein Lithium. In 2003, it purchased German company Friemann und Wolf Batterietechnik GmbH (Friwo), and the assets of Emisa and Centra, from Exide. =Doughty Hanson Funds era= In 2004, the private equity firm Doughty Hanson Funds purchased from Alcatel, at a cost of 900 million euros, a 100 percent stake in Saft, and listed it on the Euronext in June. In July 2005, Saft agreed the purchase of a 51 percent stake in AMCO Power Systems Ltd with its owner, Amalgamations Private Ltd. In January 2006 Saft and Johnson Controls Inc announced the launch of a joint venture named Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to develop, produce and sell advanced technology batteries for hybrid electric and electric vehicles. In February of that year, Saft purchased from Amalgamations Private its remaining stake in AMCO Power Systems, which was renamed AMCO-Saft India Ltd. In May 2006, EADS and Saft America, through ASB, formed the new subsidiary Advanced Thermal Batteries Inc located in Cockeysville, Maryland, with the purpose of supplying the military industry. In April 2007, Doughty Hanson sold all its stake in Saft, after an accelerated bookbuilt offering of 6.8 million shares by Goldman Sachs International at a price of 23.75 euros per share. Since then, the majority of the shares were kept on free float. =Rise and fall of the partnership with Johnson Controls= In January 2008 Johnson Controls-Saft opened the first production facility for lithium-ion hybrid vehicle batteries in Nersac, France. In 2009, Johnson Controls-Saft started the construction of a lithium-ion production plant in Michigan, while Saft built another for itself in Florida. Despite some signs of promise, Johnson Controls was increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the agreement and also sought a more important ally. In May 2011, the American company request the dissolution of Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to the Delaware Court of Chancery. The two companies agreed the separation and Johnson Controls paid Saft 145 million dollars for its shares in the joint venture as well as for the right to use certain technology developed by it. Johnson Controls retained the Michigan facility built by the partnership. The French joint facility was transferred to Saft. =Projects and present= Saft wanted to accelerate its development through acquisitions in 2012 after cashing in on the end of its joint venture with Johnson Controls and refinancing debt. In February 2013, the Boeing's difficulties with the 787 Dreamliner made Airbus drop the use of lithium-ion batteries for its A350, which hit Saft because it had a supply contract with the aircraft manufacturer, though the company publicly denied a major impact. In July 2013, Saft was awarded a $6.5 million contract to supply high power lithium-ion batteries for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Saft also supplies the battery for the Exagon Furtive-eGT, a four-seat electric sports car produced by Exagon Motors. The battery is capable of withstanding 3,000 charge cycles while conserving 80% of its capacity. In 2016, the French oil company Total acquired all Saft shares and delisted it from the stock exchange in August of that year. Divisions A TGV Atlantique train on its way to Paris.

Jibrin was the Chairman House of Representatives Committee on Finance in the 7th Assembly with oversight on the Federal Ministry of Finance and its Parastatals, Federal Revenue, Preparation of Revenue framework/Estimate for the Federal budgets, Sovereign Wealth Fund - SWIA, Tax Matters, Fiscal matters, Government investment in banks and Statutory Corporations and Agencies, Insurance and Insurance of Government properties and assets amongst other functions. Since his assumption as the Chairman of the finance committee, he has been a vocal voice on national matters; a critic and appraiser of some government's policies and actions. In 2015, Jibrin emerged as the 8th Assembly's House Committee on Appropriation Chairman until his resignation in July 2016 as the Committee Chairman. Jibrin with former Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan at the Nigerian Economic Summit Group event Jibrin commenced his political journey while serving as Coordinator of Support Groups and later Member of the PDP/Obasanjo Presidential Campaign between 2002‚Äì2003. He later served as Programme Officer at the PDP Presidential Campaign Headquarters in 2007. No sooner had Jibrin got elected into the House of Representative than he formed a group, called 7th Assembly Group, which was made up of mostly the newly elected first-time lawmakers. The aim of the group according to Jibrin, as quoted in a national newspaper, was to serve as a \\"platform for members-elect to establish acquaintance and cross-fertilize ideas emanating from various constituencies for the overall interest of the country.\\" Jibrin with Former South African President & Chair UN/Africa Union High-Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa, Mr. Thabo Mbeki & a member of the UN body, Ms. Zenuli ElBakri during a meeting in Abuja, Nigeria Jibrin was appointed by the House of Representatives as the head of a joint ad-hoc committee on Finance, Petroleum Upstream, Petroleum Downstream, and Gas Resources to investigate an alleged indebtedness of NNPC to the federation account in response to the continuing outcry by Nigerians for increasing accountability on the part of their governments. The investigation conducted by the Abdulmumin Jibrin-led joint committee later revealed a non-remittance of the sum of N450 billion by the NNPC to the federation account in contravention of Section 162 (1) of the 1999 constitution. Jibrin has also expressed discontentment on Nigeria's over- dependence on oil and gas revenue. He is therefore at the forefront of the call for an urgent need of diversification of Nigeria's economy. As a result of his experience as Chairman of the House Committee on Finance and a contribution to the country, he is embarking and funding special research on comparative analysis of Foreign Direct Investment FDI in the Oil and Gas sector and Solid Minerals sector. The research will provide answers to why there exist billions of dollars of FDI in the Oil and Gas sector and practically none in the Solid mineral sector despite its huge potentials. He has sent in a part-time Ph.D. application to several Universities home and abroad to take him in so that he can revert to the status of a student and conduct thorough research on the subject. It will be his second Ph.D. when he concludes that. Apart from his position as the Chairman of House Committee on Finance, Jibrin has headed and co-chaired a number of parliamentary investigations and assignments which include but not limited to the following: investigation of independent revenue which deals with the internally generated revenue of corporations. Under Abdulmumin's leadership, the Finance Committee discovered billions of unremitted funds to the consolidated revenue fund and subsequently compelled the corporations to pay. The Committee on Finance under Jibrin further provided justification for the commencement of the Treasury Single Account policy (TSA) and the eventual and presentation of the budgets of some Statutory Agencies that runs into billions collectively from the Executive arm of government to the Legislature by President Muhammadu Buhari. With the mandate of the House, Jibrin also led the Finance Committee to launch a comprehensive investigation into the Insurance industry and insurance of government assets and properties where wide-ranging discoveries were made bothering on issues of abuse of processes and existing laws. The Committee has commenced work to repeal and re-enact the existing insurance law.

It implements email servers to send, receive, accept, and store email for other organizations or end users, on their behalf. The term \\"mail service provider\\" was coined in the Internet Mail Architecture document .  Types  There are various kinds of email providers. There are paid and free ones, possibly sustained by advertising. Some allow anonymous users, whereby a single user can get multiple, apparently unrelated accounts. Some require full identification credentials; for example, a company may provide email accounts to full-time staff only. Often, companies, universities, organizations, groups, and individuals that manage their mail servers themselves adopt naming conventions that make it straightforward to identify who is the owner of a given email address. Besides control of the local names, insourcing may provide for data confidentiality, network traffic optimization, and fun. Mailbox providers typically accomplish their task by implementing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and possibly providing access to messages through Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), the Post Office Protocol, Webmail, or a proprietary protocol. Parts of the task can still be outsourced, for example virus and spam filtering of incoming mail, or authentication of outgoing mail. = ISP- based email = Many mailbox providers are also access providers. Not the core product, their email services could lack some interesting features, such as IMAP, Transport Layer Security, or SMTP Authentication ‚Äîin fact, an ISP can do without the latter, as it can recognize its clients by the IP addresses it assigns them. = Free mail providers = AOL Mail, Hotmail, Lycos, Mail.com, Yahoo! Mail, launched in the 1990s, are among the early providers of free email accounts, joined by GMail in 2004. They attract users because they are free and can advertise their service on every message. According to Jurvetson, Hotmail grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months. That was before it was bought by Microsoft. = Premium email services = These are the paid equivalent of free mail providers. That is, a better alternative to ISP-based email. Much less popular than free mail, they target a niche of users. = Vanity email = It is also possible to run a shim service, providing no access but just forwarding all messages to another account, which does not lend itself to direct use, for example because it is temporary or just less appealing.  Role as identifier  A mailbox provider is the administrator of the registered domain name that forms the domain-part of its email addresses. As such, it controls the MX records that specify which hosts will receive email destined to those addresses. The operators of those hosts define the meaning of the local-part of an address by associating it to a mailbox, which in turn can be associated to a user. The mailbox provider also specifies how users can read their mail, possibly creating SRV records to ease email client configuration, or giving detailed instructions. Email addresses are convenient tokens for identifying people, even at web sites unrelated to email. In fact, they are unique, and allow password reminders to be sent at will. From a bureaucracy-oriented point of view, there is no formal undertaking beyond domain name registration. This role is based on IETF standards, and, unlike X.400 and other ITU-T works, in and of itself requires no arrangements with local authorities. The notion of Administration Management Domain (ADMD) is derived afterwards, from empirical evidence. However, local authorities concerned with Internet privacy issues may add rules and requisites on top of the original Internet email design.

It is located in the Sainte- Walburge neighborhood, above the Meuse valley. The first citadel was built on the heights overlooking the city in 1255. It was rebuilt in a pentagonal shape by Prince-Bishop Maximilian Henry of Bavaria in 1650. This fortress was destroyed by France shortly afterwards, then rebuilt in 1684. During the Napoleonic Wars it was given five bastions in the style of Vauban. By the late 19th century the citadel had become obsolete, replaced by the twelve forts of the Fortified Position of Li√®ge. It continued in use as a barracks and as a command post. In the 1970s the citadel was largely destroyed by the construction of a hospital on the site. The southern walls remain. An area on the north side is a memorial to Belgians executed in the citadel by German occupiers in World Wars I and II, while 20th-century bunkers remain on the south side.

Tour des B√©gards. = Early history = Around the year 1000, during the reign of Notker, Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge, the city built its first walls in sandstone. The enclosure was shaped like an elongated rectangle of about , surrounded with a ditch and lined with towers and gates. A gate tower was built at the foot of Pierruse. The first bridge at the site of the Pont des Arches was built around 1033. In the early 12th century Holy Roman Emperor Henri IV proposed a larger enclosure, but failed to raise the necessary funds. A new wall was started in 1204 from the Porte Sainte-Walburge to Paienporte, then down to the river, and another wall was under construction between the Hocheporte and Sainte-Walburge. In May 1212 the still uncompleted walls were scaled by the troops of Henry I, Duke of Brabant, who sacked the city. Encouraged by this setback, the townsmen completed the walls in 1215. In 1255 Prince-Bishop Henri de Gueldre built the Porte Sainte Walburga, furnished with towers, a well, a drawbridge and a prison, which was in effect the first citadel on the site. In 1468 the troops of Charles the Bold destroyed the city despite an attack by the 600 Franchimontois. = 17th century = In 1650 the Holy Roman Emperor granted Prince-Bishop Maximilien Henri de Bavi√®re obtained permission to build a fort. He erected a large well-protected rectangle, relying on German engineers. The walls were of earthen construction, incorporating the 1548 Sainte-Walburge bastion. However, the construction was blown up by the French shortly after completion. Work began in 1663 on the first permanent masonry citadel. In 1671 work was completed on a pentagonal fortress with bastions at the angles and demi-lunes. On the outer side the walls were lined with ditches, and the citadel was integrated with the city walls. The bastions were named for St. Lambert, St. Francis, St. Mary, St. Maximilian and St. Henry. The Chapel of St. Balbina was placed in the center of the citadel. The French took the citadel in 1675. In 1676 the French demolished the citadel to prevent it from falling into the hands of its enemies. The bastions, demi-lunes and part of the old ramparts were undermined. In 1684 Prince-Bishop Maximilian Henry of Bavaria began to rebuild the citadel. However, the 1685 Treaty of Versailles, which guaranteed the neutrality of the Li√©geoise, required the citadel's demolition. In 1691 French troops commanded by Louis Fran√ßois, duc de Boufflers bombarded the city from the vicinity of the Fort de la Chartreuse during the Nine Years' War. In 1692 the Dutch general Menno van Coehoorn organized the defense of Li√®ge. He established a series of protected trenches on the left bank of the Meuse. This system employed light troops supported by artillery, reflecting van Coehoorn's lack of interest in fortifications. = 18th century = With the commencement of the War of Spanish Succession in 1701, the engineer Jacques de la Combe was delegated by Vauban to repair the citadel. In 1702 the engineer Filley reported to Vauban, describing the state of the citadel as lamentable. Vauban came to Li√®ge to try to convince Prince-Bishop Joseph Clemens of Bavaria to underwrite the cost of repairs. In 1702 the allies under van Coehoorn laid siege to the citadel for three days. In 1703 in accordance with the Treaties of Namur and Utrecht, Li√®ge was declared neutral. New work continued from 1707 to 1711 with the addition of new bastions and demi-lunes. The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht established peace between France and the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, followed by the Treaty of Rastatt which settled disputes between France and the Holy Roman Empire, thereby ending the War of Spanish Succession. In 1715 the Treaty of the Barrier was signed at Antwerp between the Empire and the United Provinces, requiring the demolition of the citadel of Li√®ge The bastions and walls on the town side of the citadel remained. =19th century= In 1815 the Dutch took control of the area following the defeat of Napoleon. In 1816 William I of the Netherlands authorized the reconstruction of the citadel to a plan by Camerlingh. In 1817 the St. Balbina chapel, the old Porte Sainte-Walburge and the bastion du Clerg√© were demolished. The Sainte-Lambert and Sainte-Fran√ßois bastions were rebuilt and demi-lune outworks were added. The Dutch garrison capitulated during the Belgian Revolution of 1830. The second battalion of the first Belgian Independent Regiment occupied the citadel. In 1891 a royal decree downgraded the citadel and the nearby Fort de la Chartreuse, following the construction of twelve modern forts surrounding Li√©ge. The citadel was used as a barracks. = 20th century = German Gestapo agents arrested after the fall of Li√®ge, Belgium, are herded together in a cell in the citadel of Li√®ge. In 1911 Belgian troops were billeted in the citadel. In August 1914 they participated in the defense of Li√®ge from German invasion. Following the surrender of the city the citadel was used as a place of internment and as a hospital. It continued in use as a hospital following the 1918 armistice. A command post for the Fortified Position of Li√®ge was established in the southern portion of the citadel between the warsl, which survives. The rounded concrete forms of the three bunkers contrast with the older masonry. The command post was augmented after World War II with an air intake tower equipped with filters for nuclear, biological and chemical contaminants. Following the Battle of Belgium in May 1940 the citadel was once again used by German forces to intern Belgians. It was occupied by American forces in 1945, and in 1947 Belgian forces reoccupied the citadel. In 1946 a memorial was established to those who had been executed in the citadel during World Wars I and II. The Enclos des Fusill√©s (\\"enclosure of those shot by firing squad\\") was dedicated in 1947, with 197 crosses commemorating the dead. In 1967 the citadel was turned over to the Public Centre for Social Welfare of Li√®ge, and in 1970 construction of the Centre hospitalier r√©gional de la Citadelle was begun, destroying much of the old citadel. Work on the hospital building started in 1974 and was completed in 1978. Due to the presence of underground excavations, the hospital was placed on driven piles for support. On 21 December 1977 the fortress and the were listed as classified structures. On 11 October 1982 the bastions and curtain walls were designated, and on 23 March 1988 the walls and the Porte de Pa√Øenporte were classified.

The unit is headquartered at Karlsborg Fortress in Karlsborg, V√§stra G√∂taland County. History S√§rskilda operationsgruppen was formed in 2011 by merging the Special Protection Group (SSG) and the Special Reconnaissance Group (SIG). Organisation The Special Operations Task Group (SOG) answers directly to the Supreme Commander and the Director Special Forces. The unit, combined with the Special Forces Command (SFL) , comprises the Swedish Armed Forces Special Forces (FM SF). In addition to this, there are several special forces support units (FM SOF). The personnel of which are specially selected, trained and equipped for air, sea and land infiltration, technical, logistical and medical support. For example, The Special Helicopter Group (SHG), Special Maritime Transportation unit (STE), Special Signals Group (SSE), and the Section for Operative Technology (SOT). SOG consists of two so-called response units (IE). IE1 is focused on combat tasks (Direct Action) and IE2 is focused on intelligence gathering (Special Reconnaissance). IE2 is known to utilize female intelligence personnel to conduct certain HUMINT tasks. Each SOG response unit (IE) is organized in squadrons, troops, and patrols. Three 4-man patrols make up a troop, and an unknown number of troops make up a squadron. Besides the operational elements of the unit, there is also a Training Wing, responsible for the selection and training of future and current operators. Each operator has a broader skill base than a regular soldier and one or two patrol skills at which he is exceptionally skilled. A typical SOG team consists of four operators: a team leader, a demolitions expert/breacher, a communicator, and a combat medic. Each patrol can be augmented with EOD technicians, JTAC-specialists, military working dog handlers, or snipers. Furthermore, every soldier has an infiltration specialty in either military free fall (HALO/HAHO) or combat diving. Role The most frequent usage of the SOG is during multi-national special operations such as ISAF in Afghanistan or Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq. SOG combat operations are of great strategic importance that cannot be accomplished by conventional forces or weapon systems. Combat missions can be to eliminate high-value targets or objects of great importance to the enemy, to conduct complex rescue operations of Swedish personnel held captive or hostage, or to gather time- critical intelligence through action. SOG can also, if needed and requested, augment the police counter-terrorism assets to intervene during domestic terrorism and/or hostage crisis due to new legislation implemented in 2006. Special reconnaissance and intelligence gathering is intended to gather information of great tactical importance about the enemy¬¥s activities, enemy personnel or other bits of information of operational significance. Special Forces can also be tasked with advising and training foreign military units as part of an international peace-keeping military operation. The unit maintains a high degree of readiness and can be deployed on short notice within a radius of Stockholm and can operate in any environment, for example, jungle, desert, mountain/alpine, sub-arctic and urban. The unit is deployed on request by the UN, EU or NATO but must then be sanctioned on a political level. Due to operational security, the unit's capabilities, equipment, operational methods, previous or on-going operations, and the identities of their personnel are classified. The SOG's predecessors, the SSG and SIG, participated in operations in the Balkans, Congo, Tchad and the Central African Republic. Swedish special forces have also been continuously deployed in Afghanistan from the beginning of the conflict up until the withdrawal of ISAF forces in 2014. From 2015 a contingent of around 30 operators from the SOG along with support elements has been participating in Operation Inherent Resolve, acting as advisors for Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Selection and training CQB. Selection is open for Armed Forces members of both sexes who are at least eligible for specialist officer's training. The candidates are advised to prepare themselves at least six months prior to the selection course and are invited to attend a pre-selection weekend where they will be tested and advised on their likelihood of success or failure and also where they need to improve. The selection process takes 2‚Äì3 weeks and is held once a year. Historically, candidates for SOG‚Äôs predecessors, the SSG and SIG, were sought out by the unit and invited to attempt selection. Selection for SOG, however, is advertised on the Armed Forces website and at unit garrisons and is open for anyone who meets the basic requirements. The selection consists of an extremely grueling field exercise, stretching over more than a week, where the candidates are tested on their fitness, fieldcraft and land navigation and the tests are conducted during great stress. The second week consists of psychological tests, similar to those undertaken by fighter pilots. They are also tested for their predisposition for phobias, such as heights and confined spaces. Typically, selection has a roughly 10% pass rate. If the candidate is successful, he/she will begin the basic operator course which lasts for 12 months and is divided into three blocks: * Basic combat skills * Patrol skills * Specialist skills Once completed, the operator will be put in an operational patrol within a troop and can be deployed with the unit. Personnel applying to join the unit as EOD or JTAC operators undergo the same selection process as the normal operators but do a shorter eight month basic operator course, after which they continue with specialist training in the EOD or JTAC function. Operators train at their own compound at a secret location near Karlsborg, which, among shooting ranges, also features a large multi-story CQB-building, with bullet-absorbing lining in its walls. The building also facilitates helicopter insertions on its roof. Much of their training is also conducted internationally, often alongside the special forces units of Sweden's NATO partners.  Equipment and armament  The SOG differs greatly from the rest of the Swedish Armed Forces in its equipment and armament. The most noticeable difference is their usage of Multicam rather than M90. Operators wear combat uniforms from Crye Precision or Arcteryx, a wide variety of different plate carriers and Ops Core FAST ballistic helmets. Besides the differences in equipment, the SOG also issues different firearms than the conventional military as well. Operators are issued LWRC rifles in both 5.56 and 7.62. The standard issue handgun of the unit is the Glock 17.. Support weapons such as machine guns and anti-armor weapons also differ from those usually employed by the conventional military.  Heraldry  The SOG coat of arms is blazoned thus: Upon a black shield is a six-pointed star in silver in the upper dexter corner. The field is crowned with the royal crown and laid upon a towering sword of gold. https://web.archive.org/web/20111106094333/http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/Forband- och-formagor/Specialforband/Nyheter/Nytt-heraldiskt-vapen/ The coat of arms was developed by the Armed Forces Board of Traditions and symbolizes the unit's ability of unconventional problem solving, the effectiveness of duty and clandestine operations, and the asymmetrically positioned star symbolizes asymmetric warfare. The unit insignia, worn by each operator on the combat uniform consists of a winged Norse dagger Seax with an asymmetrically positioned six-pointed star. Personnel within the Swedish Special Operations Forces, SOG and its support units also wear an olive green beret with a black, embroidered cap badge, the only non-metal cap badge within the Swedish Armed Forces. It is normally worn in public only by the Director Special Forces, a brigadier general, since the identities of all the operatives are classified.

The church was damaged during World War II, resulting in extensive restoration which included the removal of the Baroque extension to the westwerk and replacement with a simple hip roof in the Romanesque style. Architecture St Georg's has the trefoil-shaped eastern end typical of other Romanesque churches of Cologne, its chancel and transepts each terminating in an apse. The nave is unique in Cologne in having its arcade supported on columns rather than piers. There is a robust westwerk with walls of 5 metres thick, suggesting that it was intended to be much taller than actually built.St George's, (accessed 16-08-2012) The original Romanesque roof of the westwerk was replaced with a Baroque belfry, but this was damaged during World War II and later replaced with a steeply pitched hip roof of copper.St. George's, Cologne, (accessed 16-08-2012) During the late 1920s the church had been entirely glazed by the Expressionist artist, Johan Thorn Prikker.

The Electric Swing Circus formed in June 2011. The band's preview EP, Penniless Optimist, was released in September 2011, and their debut album \\"Electric Swing Circus\\" in May 2013. They released their second album \\"It Flew By\\" in January 2017. History =2011= The Electric Swing Circus had their first live performance at the Book Club on 17 September 2011. The band also recorded the video for ‚Äò‚ÄôPenniless Optimist‚Äô‚Äô, which was filmed in Boxxed by Realm Pictures. During October 2011 Penniless Optimist was remixed by C@ in the H@ and Sam Redmore. Penniless Optimist received airplay on BBC Radio 6 on The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show. The video for Penniless Optimist was also shown on BBC Big Screens nationwide. At the ElectroSwing People's Favourite Awards, The Electric Swing Circus won Best Live Act award in December 2011. Electric Swing Circus has a residency at Hot Club de Swing, a club night at the Hare and Hounds, Birmingham. =2012= The Electric Swing Circus played many festivals during 2012, including Bestival, Secret Garden Party, Nozstock, BoomTown Fair, Beat-Herder, Fieldview and WOMAD. The band also performed as headline act on the Main Stage of Vale Festival 2012. The relentless touring at as many of the U.K. festivals as possible, helped to earn them a quick reputation of being a hard working band to have a party to. =2013 - Debut album Electric Swing Circus released= The Electric Swing Circus filmed the video for the single Valentine in March 2013. It was filmed in Birmingham Municipal Bank and premi√®red at Swingamajig Festival in May that year. On 9 May 2013, the band released their self-titled debut album. Over the European summer, the band played several big name festivals, including their biggest show to date on the Spirit of 71' / Glade stage Glastonbury Festival, Shambala (where they brought their own tent, the Swingamajig Speakeasy to the festival) and Fusion Festival. These shows helped to establish the band as firm festival favourites, with a growing reputation. They were listed in the Glastonbury guide as \\"one of the highlights of Glastonbury\\" =2014= Off the back of the success of the debut album, Electric Swing Circus carried on touring, now a mainstay at all UK festivals and starting to branch further out to play all of Europe. The band also played Edinburgh festival for the first time, having a residency with the Assembly group, whilst also performing on the BBC stage, who described them as \\"Electro-swing at its best\\". They established the Swingamajig Speakeasy tent at Shambala festival. =2015= They headlined the Avalon Stage on the last night of Glastonbury festival. Towards the end of 2015 they began to record their second album. =2016 - Recording and European tour = The band recorded their second album mostly at the beginning of 2016. The band ran another successful crowdfunded campaign to help fund the new album and recorded at Middle Farm and Giant Wafer studios. The band played Swingamajig festival, where they released \\"Empires EP (Swingamajig Edition)\\" and included the tracks \\"Empires\\" and \\"Hit&Run;\\" which were the first tracks recorded for the new album. The band returned to the studio to complete their second album which was titled It Flew By. They recorded a video for the lead single \\"Empires\\" which was released and received significant attention on Reddit. =2017 and It Flew By= 2017 marked the release of their second album It Flew By, released through their own label Ragtime Records. The Soul of a Clown blog said \\"Electric Swing Circus are quite rightly regarded as one of the leading lights in the electro swing scene. Unlike others they have not settled for covers or to being restricted by that style. This album shows them continuing to grow and develop their sound. It steps away from the clich√©s to allow them to have a far wider appeal\\" The band marked the release of the album with another new video, this time for \\"Mama Cita\\" =2019 and \\"Connected/ Invisible Man E.P.\\"= Following initial recording sessions in late 2018, ESC released the \\"Connected/ Invisible Man E.P.\\" recorded with long-term collaborator and producer James Bragg. They followed this with video's for every track on the E.P. The relentless tour schedule continued including prestigious headline slots at festivals all over Europe, including Heitere Open Air Festival In Switzerland. Swingamajig Festival In May 2013, the band hosted a one-day festival in Digbeth, Birmingham, which was the first of its kind in the UK. Headline acts included The Correspondents, Dutty Moonshine, Odjbox and Pierre, DJ Switch and C@ in the H@. The festival sold out. In May 2014, the second Swingamajig Festival took place in Digbeth, with many well-reputed acts including Molotov Jukebox, featuring Natalie Tena. The third festival in 2015 featured Chinese man, and the fourth in 2016 featured Balkan Beat Box as headliners. This is the Electric Swing Circus's very own festival which they co headline every year.

Within the language of potential theory it reduces the partial differential equation to an integral equation on the boundary to which the theory of Fredholm operators can be applied. The theory is particularly simple in two dimensions‚Äîthe case treated in detail in this article‚Äîwhere it is related to complex function theory, the conjugate Beurling transform or complex Hilbert transform and the Fredholm eigenvalues of bounded planar domains. Dirichlet and Neumann problems Green's theorem for a bounded region Œ© in the plane with smooth boundary ‚àÇŒ© states that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} A\\\\, dx + B\\\\, dy =\\\\iint_\\\\Omega (B_x-A_y)\\\\, dx\\\\, dy.} One direct way to prove this is as follows. By subtraction, it is sufficient to prove the theorem for a region bounded by a simple smooth curve. Any such is diffeomorphic to the closed unit disk. By change of variables it is enough to prove the result there. Separating the A and B terms, the right hand side can be written as a double integral starting in the x or y direction, to which the fundamental theorem of calculus can be applied. This converts the integral over the disk into the integral over its boundary. Let Œ© be a region bounded by a simple closed curve. Given a smooth function f on the closure of Œ© its normal derivative ‚àÇnf at a boundary point is the directional derivative in the direction of the outward pointing normal vector. Applying Green's theorem with A = vx u and B = vy u gives the first of Green's identities: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} u \\\\, \\\\partial_nv = \\\\iint_\\\\Omega u_x v_x + u_y v_y - u \\\\, \\\\Delta v,} where the Laplacian Œî is given by :\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta = -\\\\partial^2_x -\\\\partial_y^2. Swapping u and v and subtracting gives the second of Green's identities: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} u \\\\, \\\\partial_nv - \\\\partial_nu \\\\, v=\\\\iint_\\\\Omega \\\\, \\\\Delta u \\\\, v - u \\\\, \\\\Delta v.} If now u is harmonic in Œ© and v = 1, then this identity implies that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\partial_n u = 0,} so the integral of the normal derivative of a harmonic function on the boundary of a region always vanishes. A similar argument shows that the average of a harmonic function on the boundary of a disk equals its value at the centre. Translating the disk can be taken to be centred at 0. Green's identity can be applied to an annulus formed of the boundary of the disk and a small circle centred on 0 with v = z2: it follows that the average is independent of the circle. It tends to the value at its value at 0 as the radius of the smaller circle decreases. This result also follows easily using Fourier series and the Poisson integral. For continuous functions f on the whole plane which are smooth in Œ© and the complementary region Œ©c, the first derivative can have a jump across the boundary of Œ©. The value of the normal derivative at a boundary point can be computed from inside or outside Œ©. The interior normal derivative will be denoted by ‚àÇn‚àí and the exterior normal derivative by ‚àÇn+. With this terminology the four basic problems of classical potential theory are as follows: *Interior Dirichlet problem: ‚àÜu = 0 in Œ©, u = f on ‚àÇŒ© *Interior Neumann problem: ‚àÜu = 0 in Œ©, ‚àÇn‚àí u = f on ‚àÇŒ© *Exterior Dirichlet problem: ‚àÜu = 0 in Œ©c, u = f on ‚àÇŒ©, u continuous at ‚àû *Exterior Neumann problem: ‚àÜu = 0 in Œ©c, ‚àÇn+ u = f on ‚àÇŒ©, u continuous at ‚àû For the exterior problems the inversion map z‚àí1 takes harmonic functions on Œ©c into harmonic functions on the image of Œ©c under the inversion map. Up to composition with complex conjugation, this is the special case of the Kelvin transform in two dimensions. In this case, since a function is harmonic if and only if it is the real part of a holomorphic function, the statement follows from the fact that the composition of holomorphic functions is holomorphic. The transform v of u is continuous in a small disc z ‚â§ r and harmonic everywhere in the interior except possibly 0. Let w be the harmonic function given by the Poisson integral on z ‚â§ r with the same boundary value g as v on z = r. Applying the maximum principle to v ‚àí w + Œµ log z on Œ¥ ‚â§ z ‚â§ r, it must be negative for Œ¥ small. Hence v(z) ‚â§ u(z) for z ‚â† 0. The same argument applies with v and w swapped, so v = w is harmonic in the disk. Thus the singularity at ‚àû is removable. By the maximum principle the interior and exterior Dirichlet problems have unique solutions. For the interior Neumann problem, if a solution u is harmonic in 0 and its interior normal derivative vanishes, then Green's first identity implies the ux = 0 = uy, so that u is constant. This shows the interior Neumann problem has a unique solution up to adding constants. Applying inversion, the same holds for the external Neumann problem. For both Neumann problems, a necessary condition for a solution to exist is :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} f\\\\,\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\,0.} For the interior Neumann problem, this follows by setting v = 1 in Green's second identity. For the exterior Neumann problem, the same can be done for the intersection of Œ©c and a large disk z < R, giving :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} f\\\\,\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\,\\\\int_{z=R}\\\\partial_n u.} At ‚àû u is the real part of a holomorphic function F with :\\\\displaystyle{F(z)=a_0 + a_1z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2} + \\\\cdots} The interior normal derivative on z = R is just the radial derivative ‚àÇr, so that for z = R :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_r F(z) = F^\\\\prime(z)\\\\le C R^{-2}.} Hence :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\left\\\\int_{z=R}\\\\partial_n u\\\\right\\\\le 2\\\\pi CR^{-1},} so the integral over ‚àÇŒ© must vanish. The fundamental solution of the Laplacian is given by :\\\\displaystyle{E(z) =-{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\log z.} N(z) = ‚àí E(z) is called the Newtonian potential in the plane. Using polar coordinates, it is easy to see that E is in Lp on any closed disk for any finite p ‚â• 1. To say that E is a fundamental solution of the Laplacian means that for any smooth function œÜ of compact support :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\iint E \\\\cdot\\\\Delta\\\\varphi = \\\\varphi(0).} The standard proof uses Green's second identity on the annulus r ‚â§ z ‚â§ R where the support of œÜ is contained in z < R. In fact, since E is harmonic away from 0, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\iint_{z\\\\ge r} E \\\\cdot \\\\Delta \\\\varphi ={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\varphi(r e^{i\\\\theta}) - r \\\\cdot \\\\log r\\\\cdot\\\\partial_n\\\\varphi(re^{i\\\\theta}) \\\\, d\\\\theta.} As r tends to zero, the first term on the right hand side tends to œÜ(0) and the second to 0, since r log r tends to 0 and the normal derivatives of œÜ are uniformly bounded. (That both sides are equal even before taking limits follows from the fact that the average of a harmonic function on the boundary of a disk equals it value at the centre, while the integral of its normal derivative vanishes.) Neumann‚ÄìPoincar√© kernel The properties of the fundamental solution lead to the following formula for recovering a harmonic function u in Œ© from its boundary values: :\\\\displaystyle{u(z)=\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} K(z,w)u(w) - N(z-w)\\\\partial_n u(w) \\\\,dw,} where K is the Neumann‚àíPoincar√© kernel :\\\\displaystyle{K(z,w)=\\\\partial_{n,w} N(z-w).} To prove this identity, Green's second identity can be applied to Œ© with a small disk centred on z removed. This reduces to showing that the identity holds in the limit for a small disk centred on z shrinking in size. Translating, it can be assumed that z = 0 and the identity becomes :\\\\displaystyle{u(0)=\\\\lim_{r\\\\rightarrow 0} {1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} u(re^{i\\\\theta}) - r\\\\cdot \\\\log r \\\\cdot \\\\partial_r u(re^{i\\\\theta})\\\\,d\\\\theta,} which was proved above. A similar formula holds for functions harmonic in Œ©c: :\\\\displaystyle{u(z)=\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} -K(z,w)u(w) + N(z-w)\\\\partial_n u(w) \\\\,dw.} The signs are reversed because of the direction of the normal derivative. In two dimensions the Neumann‚ÄìPoincar√© kernel K(z,w) has the remarkable property that it restricts to a smooth function on ‚àÇŒ© √ó ‚àÇŒ©. It is a priori only defined as a smooth function off the diagonal but it admit a (unique) smooth extension to the diagonal. Using vector notation v(t) = (x(t), y(t)) to parametrize the boundary curve by arc length, the following classical formulas hold: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{v}}\\\\cdot \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{v}} =1,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{v}}\\\\cdot \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{v}} = 0.} Thus the unit tangent vector t(t) at t is the velocity vector :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{t} =\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{v}},} so the oriented unit normal n(t) is :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{n}=(-\\\\dot{y},\\\\dot{x}).} The constant relating the acceleration vector to the normal vector is the curvature of the curve: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{v}}=\\\\kappa(t)\\\\,\\\\mathbf{n}(t).} Thus the curvature is given by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\kappa=\\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{v}}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}=\\\\ddot{y}\\\\dot {x} - \\\\ddot{x}\\\\dot{y}.} There are two further formulas of Frenet: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{n}}=-\\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{t},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{n}}= \\\\dot{\\\\kappa}\\\\mathbf{n} -\\\\kappa^2 \\\\mathbf{t}.} The Neumann‚ÄìPoincar√© kernel is given by the formula :\\\\displaystyle{K(\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}(t))=-{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} {(\\\\mathbf{u}-\\\\mathbf{v}(t))\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}(t)\\\\over \\\\mathbf{u}-\\\\mathbf{v}^2}.} For s ‚â† t, set :\\\\displaystyle{k(s,t)=K(v(s),v(t)).} The function :\\\\displaystyle{a(s,t)={v(s)-v(t)^2\\\\over e^{is/L} -e^{it/L}^2}} is smooth and nowhere vanishing with a(s,s) = L2 if the length of the curve is 2L. Similarly the function :\\\\displaystyle{b(s,t)= {(\\\\mathbf{v}(s)-\\\\mathbf{v}(t))\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}(t)\\\\over e^{is/L} -e^{it/L}^2}} is smooth. In fact writing s = t + h, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{v}(t+h)-\\\\mathbf{v}(t)=h \\\\mathbf{t}(t) + {h^2\\\\over 2} \\\\kappa(t) \\\\mathbf{n}(t) -{h^3\\\\over 6} \\\\kappa(t)\\\\mathbf{t}(t) + {h^4 \\\\over 24}(\\\\dot{\\\\kappa}\\\\mathbf{n} -\\\\kappa^2 \\\\mathbf{t}) + \\\\cdots , } so that :\\\\displaystyle{h^{-2}(\\\\mathbf{v}(t+h)-\\\\mathbf{v}(t))\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}(t)=\\\\kappa(t)/2 +h^2 \\\\dot{\\\\kappa}(t)/24 +\\\\cdots} On the diagonal b(t,t) = Œ∫ L2 / 2. Since k is proportional to b / a, it is also smooth. Its diagonal values are given by the formula :\\\\displaystyle{k(t,t)=-{\\\\kappa(t)\\\\over 4\\\\pi}.} Another expression for k(s,t) is as follows: :\\\\displaystyle{k(s,t)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\partial_t \\\\arg (z(s) - z(t)),} where z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) is the boundary curve parametrized by arc length. This follows from the identity :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\log z = \\\\log z + i\\\\arg z} and the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations which can be used to express the normal derivative in terms of the tangential derivative, and :\\\\displaystyle{K(\\\\mathbf{v}(t)+ \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{n}(t),\\\\mathbf{v}(t))=-{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi \\\\lambda},} so in the direction normal to the boundary curve K is discontinuous at the boundary. Double layer potentials The double layer potential with moment œÜ in C(‚àÇŒ©) is defined on the complement of ‚àÇŒ© as :\\\\displaystyle{D(\\\\varphi)(z)= \\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} K(z,w)\\\\varphi(w)\\\\, dw.} It is a continuous function on the complement. Since the restriction of K extends to a smooth function on ‚àÇŒ© √ó ‚àÇŒ©, D(œÜ) can also be defined on ‚àÇŒ©. However like the Neumann‚ÄìPoincar√© kernel it will have discontinuities at the boundary. These are jump discontinuities. If œÜ is real, then the double layer potential is just the real part of a Cauchy integral: :\\\\displaystyle{D(\\\\varphi)(z)= \\\\Re {1\\\\over 2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} {\\\\varphi(w)\\\\over w-z}\\\\,dw .} The simplest case is when œÜ is identically 1 on ‚àÇŒ©. In this case D(1) equals *1 on Œ©, by the vanishing of the integral of the normal derivative on the boundary region bounded by ‚àÇŒ© and a small disk centred on z; so the integral over the ‚àÇŒ© equals the average of the function 1 on the boundary of small disk and hence equals 1. (This integral and the one for Œ©c can also be calculated using Cauchy's integral theorem.) *0 on Œ©c, because it is the integral of a normal derivative of a harmonic function. *1/2 on ‚àÇŒ©, since ::\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} K(z,w) dw ={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{s-\\\\pi L}^{s+\\\\pi L} \\\\partial_t \\\\arg (z(s) - z(t))\\\\, dt =1/2.} By definition the Neumann‚ÄìPoincar√© operator TK is the operator on L2(‚àÇŒ©) given by the kernel K(z,w). It is a Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator since the kernel is continuous. It takes values in C‚àû(‚àÇŒ©) since the kernel is smooth. The third computation above is equivalent to the statement that the constant function 1 is an eigenfunction of TK with eigenvalue 1/2. To establish jump formulas for more general functions, it is necessary to check that the integrals for D(1) are uniformly absolutely convergent, i.e. that there is a uniform finite bound C such that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} K(z,w)\\\\, dw \\\\le C} for all z not in the boundary. It is enough to check this for points in a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary. Any such point u lies on a normal through a unique point, v(0) say, on the curve and it is enough to look at the contribution to the integral from points v(t) with t in a small interval around 0. Writing :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\mathbf{v}(0) + \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{n}(0),} it follows that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{v}(t)-\\\\mathbf{u}= -\\\\lambda\\\\mathbf{n}(0) + t\\\\mathbf{t}(0) + {t^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\kappa(0)\\\\mathbf{n}(0) + O(t^3).} So for t sufficiently small :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{v}(t)-\\\\mathbf{u}^2 = \\\\lambda^2 + t^2(1-\\\\lambda\\\\kappa(0)) + O(t^3)\\\\ge (\\\\lambda^2 + t^2)/2,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(\\\\mathbf{v}(t)-\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}(0) =-\\\\lambda + {t^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\kappa(0) + O(t^3)\\\\le \\\\lambda + C_1t^2} for some constant C1. (The first inequality gives an approximate version of Pythagoras' theorem in the tubular neighbourhood.) Hence :\\\\displaystyle{2\\\\pi\\\\cdot K(\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}(t))={(\\\\mathbf{v}(t)-\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}(0)\\\\over \\\\mathbf{v}(t)-\\\\mathbf{u}^2} \\\\le {2\\\\lambda + C_1t^2\\\\over \\\\lambda^2 + t^2}\\\\le {2\\\\lambda\\\\over \\\\lambda^2 + t^2} +C_1.} Uniform boundedness follows because the first term has a finite integral independent of Œª: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\lambda\\\\, dt\\\\over t^2 + \\\\lambda^2} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {dt\\\\over t^2 + 1}=\\\\pi<\\\\infty.} The bound above can be used to prove that if the moment œÜ vanishes at a boundary point z then its double layer potential D(œÜ) is continuous at z. More generally if œÜn tends uniformly to œÜ, then D(œÜn)(zn) converges to D(œÜ)(z). In fact suppose that œÜ(w) ‚â§ Œµ if w - z ‚â§ Œ¥. Taking zn tending to z :D(\\\\varphi_n)(z_n) - D(\\\\varphi)(z) \\\\le \\\\int_{w-z\\\\ge\\\\delta} K(z_n,w)-K(z,w)\\\\varphi(w)\\\\,dw +\\\\int_{w-z\\\\le\\\\delta} (K(z_n,w)+K(z,w))\\\\cdot\\\\varphi(w) \\\\, dw ::::::::::::: \\\\+ \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} K(z_n,w)\\\\cdot \\\\varphi_n(w) -\\\\varphi(w)\\\\, dw. The first integrand tends uniformly to 0 so the integral tends to 0. The second integral is bounded above by 2ŒµC. The third integral is bounded by C times the supremum norm of œÜn ‚àí œÜ. Hence D(œÜ)(zn) tends to D(œÜ)(z). JUMP FORMULAS. If œÜ is a continuous function on ‚àÇŒ©, the restrictions of its double layer potential u = DœÜ to Œ© and Œ©c extend uniquely to continuous functions on their closures. Let u‚àí and u+ be the resulting continuous functions on ‚àÇŒ©. Then :\\\\displaystyle{u_-(z) = {1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi(z) + T_K\\\\varphi(z),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, u_+(z) = -{1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi(z) + T_K\\\\varphi(z).} In particular :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi=u_- - u_+.} In fact the expressions for u¬± are continuous, so it is enough to show that the if zn tends to a boundary point z with zn in Œ© or Œ©c then u(zn) tends to the expression for u¬±(z). If zn lie in Œ© or Œ©c then :\\\\displaystyle{u(z_n) \\\\mp {1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi(z) - T_K\\\\varphi(z)=\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} (K(z_n,w) -K(z,w))(\\\\varphi(w)-\\\\varphi(z))\\\\,dw = D(\\\\psi)(z_n) - D(\\\\psi)(z),} where œà(w) = œÜ(w) ‚àí œÜ(z). The right hand side tends to zero since œà vanishes at z. Single layer potentials The single layer potential with moment œÜ in C(‚àÇŒ©) is defined on C as :\\\\displaystyle{S(\\\\varphi)(z)=\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} N(z-w)\\\\varphi(w)\\\\,dw,} where N is the Newtonian potential :\\\\displaystyle{N(z)={1\\\\over 2 \\\\pi} \\\\log z.} The single layer potential is harmonic off ‚àÇŒ©. Since :\\\\displaystyle{S(\\\\varphi)(z)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{\\\\partial} (\\\\log z-w - \\\\log z) \\\\varphi(w)\\\\,dw + {\\\\log z \\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int \\\\varphi(w) \\\\, dw,} and the first integrand tends uniformly to 0 as z tends to infinity, the single layer potential is harmonic at infinity if and only if ‚à´ œÜ = 0. The single layer potential is continuous on C. In fact continuity off ‚àÇŒ© is clear. If zn tends to z with z in ‚àÇŒ©, then :S(\\\\varphi)(z)-S(\\\\varphi)(z_n) \\\\le{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{w-z\\\\ge \\\\varepsilon} \\\\log z-w -\\\\log z_n-w\\\\,\\\\varphi(w)\\\\, dw + \\\\\\\\varphi\\\\_\\\\infty \\\\int_{w-z\\\\le \\\\varepsilon} (\\\\logz-w + \\\\logz_n-w)\\\\, dw. The first integrand tends uniformly to 0 on w - z ‚â• Œµ. For n sufficiently large the last integral is bounded by :\\\\displaystyle{2\\\\int_{w-z\\\\le 2\\\\varepsilon} \\\\logz-w \\\\,\\\\, dw,} which tends to 0 as Œµ tends to 0, by the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality since the integrand is square integrable. The same argument shows that S = TN defines a bounded operator on C(‚àÇŒ©): :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\S\\\\varphi\\\\_\\\\infty \\\\le C^\\\\prime \\\\\\\\varphi\\\\_\\\\infty,} for œÜ in C(‚àÇŒ©). Although the single layer potentials are continuous, their first derivatives have a jump discontinuity across ‚àÇŒ©. On the tubular neighbourhood of ‚àÇŒ©, the normal derivative is defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_n u(z + a\\\\mathbf{n}_z)={d\\\\over dt} a(z+t\\\\mathbf{n}_z)_{t=a}.} It follows that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_n S(\\\\varphi)(z)=\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} K(w,z) \\\\varphi(w)\\\\,dw,} so it is given by the adjoint kernel of K: :\\\\displaystyle{K^*(z,w)=K(w,z).} The kernel K* extends naturally to a smooth function on ‚àÇŒ© √ó ‚àÇŒ© and the operator TK* is the adjoint of TK on L2(‚àÇŒ©). JUMP FORMULAS. If œÜ is a continuous function on ‚àÇŒ©, the normal derivatives of the single layer potential u = S(œÜ) on Œ© and Œ©c near ‚àÇŒ© extend continuously to the closure of both regions, defining continuous functions ‚àÇn- u and ‚àÇn+ u on ‚àÇŒ©. Then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_{n-}u(z) = -{1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi(z) + T_K^*\\\\varphi(z),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\partial_{n+}u(z) = {1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi(z) + T_K^*\\\\varphi(z).} In particular :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi=\\\\partial_{n+}u - \\\\partial_{n-}u.} In fact let v = D(œÜ) be the double layer potential with moment œÜ. On ‚àÇŒ© set :\\\\displaystyle{f=T_K\\\\varphi + T_K^*\\\\varphi} and on the complement of ‚àÇŒ© in a tubular neighbourhood set :\\\\displaystyle{f=v +\\\\partial_n u.} Then f is continuous on the tubular neighbourhood. In fact, by definition is continuous on ‚àÇŒ© and its complement, so it suffices to that f(zn) tends to f(z) whenever zn is a sequence of points in the complement tending to a boundary point z. In this case :\\\\displaystyle{f(z_n)-f(z)=\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} (K(w,z_n) + K(z_n,w) - K(w,z) - K(z,w))\\\\varphi(w) \\\\, dw =\\\\int_{w-z\\\\ge \\\\delta} + \\\\int_{w-z\\\\le \\\\delta}.} The integrand tends uniformly to 0 for w ‚àí z ‚â• Œ¥, so the first integral tends to 0. To show the second integral is small for Œ¥ small, it suffices to show that the integrand is uniformly bounded. This follows because, if Œ∂n is the point on ‚àÇŒ© with normal containing zn, then :\\\\displaystyle{2\\\\piK(z_n,w)+K(w,z_n) ={(z_n-w)\\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{n}_{\\\\zeta_n} -\\\\mathbf{n}_w)\\\\over z_n-w^2}\\\\le {\\\\mathbf{n}_{\\\\zeta_n} -\\\\mathbf{n}_w\\\\over z_n-w}={\\\\mathbf{n}_{\\\\zeta_n} -\\\\mathbf{n}_w\\\\over \\\\zeta_n-w}\\\\cdot {\\\\zeta_n -w\\\\over z_n-w}.} The first term the last product uniformly bounded because of the smoothness of the Gauss map n(t). The second is uniformly bounded because of the approximate version of Pythagoras' theorem: :\\\\displaystyle{z_n -w^2 \\\\ge (z_n-\\\\zeta_n^2 + \\\\zeta_n -w^2)/2.} Continuity of f implies that on ‚àÇŒ© :\\\\displaystyle{T_K\\\\varphi + T^*_K\\\\varphi= v_\\\\pm +\\\\partial_{n\\\\pm}u=\\\\mp\\\\varphi/2 +T_K\\\\varphi +\\\\partial_{n\\\\pm}u,} which gives the jump formulas. Derivatives of layer potentials If the moment œÜ is smooth, the derivatives of the single and double layer potentials on Œ© and Œ©c extend continuously to their closures. As usual the gradient of a function f defined on an open set in R2 is defined by :\\\\displaystyle{ abla f=(\\\\partial_xf,\\\\partial_yf).} Set :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\widetilde{ abla} f=(\\\\partial_yf, -\\\\partial_xf).} If the moment œÜ is smooth, then :\\\\displaystyle{ abla S(\\\\varphi) = -D(\\\\varphi \\\\mathbf{n}) + S(\\\\partial_t (\\\\varphi \\\\mathbf{t})),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, abla D(\\\\varphi)=\\\\widetilde{ abla} S(\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}).} In fact :\\\\displaystyle{ abla_z N(z-w)=- abla_wN(z-w) =-\\\\partial_{n,w}N(z-w)\\\\mathbf{n}_w -\\\\partial_tN(z-w)\\\\mathbf{t}_w,} so that :\\\\displaystyle{ abla S(\\\\varphi)= -D(\\\\varphi \\\\mathbf{n})-\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} (\\\\partial_{t}N(z-\\\\mathbf{v}(t))) \\\\varphi(t)\\\\mathbf{t}(t)\\\\, dt= -D(\\\\varphi \\\\mathbf{n})+ S(\\\\partial_t (\\\\varphi \\\\mathbf{t})).} Moreover :\\\\displaystyle{ abla D(\\\\varphi) = \\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\Delta_z N(z-w)\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\varphi -\\\\widetilde{ abla}\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\partial_{t}N(z-\\\\mathbf{v}(t))\\\\,\\\\varphi \\\\, dt=\\\\widetilde{ abla} S(\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}).} The second relation can be rewritten by substituting in from the first relation: :\\\\displaystyle{ abla D(\\\\varphi)=D(\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}\\\\mathbf{t}) + S(\\\\partial_t(\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}\\\\mathbf{n})),} Regularity of layer potentials. As a consequence of these relations, successive derivatives can all be expressed in terms of single and double layer potentials of smooth moments on the boundary. Since the layer potentials on Œ© and Œ©c have continuous limits on the boundary it follows that they define smooth functions on the closures of Œ© and Œ©c. Continuity of normal derivatives of double layer potentials. Just as the single layer potentials are continuous at the boundary with a jump in the normal derivative, so the double layer potentials have a jump across the boundary while their normal derivatives are continuous. In fact from the formula above :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_n D(\\\\varphi)(\\\\mathbf{v}(s) +\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{n}(s))= D(\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}\\\\mathbf{t}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}(s))+ S(\\\\partial_t(\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}\\\\mathbf{n})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}(s)).} If sn tends to s and Œªn tends to 0, the first term tends to TK(v(s)) since the moments tend uniformly to a moment vanishing at t = s; the second term is continuous because it is a single layer potential. Solution of Dirichlet and Neumann problems The following properties of T = TK are required to solve the boundary value problem: * 1/2 is not a generalized eigenvalue of TK or TK*; it has multiplicity one. * ‚àí1/2 is not an eigenvalue of TK or TK*. In fact since a I + T is a Fredholm operator of index 0, it and its adjoint have kernels of equal dimension. The same applies to any power of this operator. So it suffices to verify each of the statements for either T or T*. To check that T has no generalized eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1/2 it suffices to show that :\\\\displaystyle{T_K\\\\varphi -{1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi = 1} has no solutions. The definition of the double layer potential shows that it vanishes at ‚àû, so that it is harmonic at ‚àû. The equation above shows that if u = D(œÜ) then u+ = 1. On the other hand, applying the inversion map gives a contradiction; for it would produce a harmonic map in bounded region vanishing at an interior point with boundary value 1, which contradicts the fact that 1 is the only harmonic map with boundary value 1. If the eigenvalue 1/2 has multiplicity greater than 1, there is a moment œÜ such that T*œÜ = œÜ/2 and ‚à´ œÜ = 0. It follows that if u = S(œÜ) then ‚àÇn‚àí u = 0. By uniqueness u is constant on Œ©. Since u is continuous on R2 ‚à™ ‚àû and is harmonic at ‚àû (since ‚à´ œÜ = 0) and constant on ‚àÇŒ©, it must be zero. Hence œÜ = ‚àÇn+ u ‚àí ‚àÇn‚àí u = 0. Thus the eigenspace is one-dimensional and the eigenfunction œà can be normalized so that S(œà) = 1 on ‚àÇŒ©. In general if :\\\\displaystyle{T_K^*\\\\varphi +{1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi = f,} then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\int \\\\varphi =\\\\int f,} since :\\\\int f=(f,1)=((T_K^* +{1\\\\over 2})\\\\varphi,1)=(\\\\varphi,(T_K + {1\\\\over 2})1)=(\\\\varphi,1)=\\\\int \\\\varphi. If œÜ satisfies :\\\\displaystyle{T_K^*\\\\varphi +{1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi = 0,} it follows that ‚à´ œÜ = 0 and so u = S(œÜ) is harmonic at infinity. By the jump formulas, ‚àÇn-u = 0. By uniqueness u is constant on Œ©. By continuity it is constant on ‚àÇŒ©. Since it is harmonic on Œ©c and vanishes at infinity, it must vanish identically. As above this forces œÜ = 0. These results on the eigenvalues of TK lead to the following conclusions about the four boundary value problems: *there is always a unique solution to the interior and exterior Dirichlet problems; *there is a solution to the interior and exterior Neumann problems if and only if ‚à´ f = 0; the solution is unique up to a constant for the interior Neumann problem and unique for the exterior problem; *the solution is smooth on the closure of the domain if the boundary data is smooth. The solution is obtained as follows: *Interior Dirichlet problem. Let œÜ be the unique solution of TKœÜ + œÜ/2 = f. Then u = D(œÜ) gives the solution of the Dirichlet problem in Œ© by the jump formula. *Exterior Dirichlet problem. Since 1 is not in the range of TK ‚àí ¬ΩI, f can be written uniquely as f = TKœÜ ‚àí œÜ/2 + Œª where œÜ is unique up to a constant. Then u = D(œÜ) + ŒªS(œà) gives the solution of the Dirichlet problem in Œ©c by the jump formula. *Interior Neumann problem. The condition (f,1) = 0 implies that f = TK*œÜ ‚àí œÜ/2 can be solved. Then u = S(œÜ) gives the solution of the Neumann problem in Œ© by the jump formula. *Exterior Neumann problem. Let œÜ be the unique solution of TK*œÜ + œÜ/2 = f. Then u = S(œÜ) gives the solution of the Neumann problem in Œ© by the jump formula. The smoothness of the solution follows from the regularity of single and double layer potentials. Calder√≥n projector There is another consequence of the laws giverning the derivatives, which completes the symmetry of the jump relations, is that normal derivative of the double layer potential has no jump across the boundary, i.e. it has a continuous extension to a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary given by :\\\\displaystyle{H(\\\\varphi)=-\\\\partial_n D(\\\\varphi)_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} =-\\\\partial_t(S(\\\\partial_t\\\\varphi)_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}).} H is called a hypersingular operator. Although it takes smooth functions to smooth functions, it is not a bounded operator on L2(‚àÇŒ©). In fact it is a pseudodifferential operator of order 1, so does define a bounded operator between Sobolev spaces on ‚àÇŒ©, decreasing the order by 1. It allows a 2 √ó 2 matrix of operators to be defined by :\\\\displaystyle{C=\\\\begin{pmatrix} {1\\\\over 2}I + T_K & S H & {1\\\\over 2}I - T_K^*\\\\end{pmatrix}.} The matrix satisfies C2 = C, so is an idempotent, called the Calder√≥n projector. This identity is equivalent the following classical relations, the first of which is the symmetrization relation of Plemelj: :\\\\displaystyle{ST^*=TS,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,SH={1\\\\over 4}I - T^2,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, HS={1\\\\over 4}I - (T^*)^2, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, HT=T^*H.} The operators T and S are pseudodifferential operators of order ‚àí1. The relations above follow by considering u = S(œÜ). It has boundary value SœÜ) and normal derivative T* œÜ ‚àí œÜ/2. Hence in Œ© :\\\\displaystyle{u=D(S\\\\varphi) - S(T^*\\\\varphi) + S(\\\\varphi)/2.} Taking the boundary values of both sides and their normal derivative yields 2 equations. Two more result by considering D(Œ®); these imply the relations for the Calder√≥n projector. Fredholm eigenvalues The non-zero eigenvalues of the Neumann‚ÄìPoincar√© operator TK are called the Fredholm eigenvalues of the region Œ©. Since TK is a compact operator, indeed a Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator, all non-zero elements in its spectrum are eigenvalues of finite multiplicity by the general theory of Fredholm operators. The solution of the boundary value requires knowledge of the spectrum at ¬± 1/2, namely that the constant function gives an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 1/2 and multiplicity one; that there are no corresponding generalized eigenfunctions with eigenvalue 1/2; and that -1/2 is not an eigenvalue. proved that all non-zero eigenvalues are real and contained in the interval (-1/2,1/2]. proved that the other non-zero eigenvalues have an important symmetry property, namely that if Œª is an eigenvalue with 0 < Œª < 1/2, then so is ‚ÄìŒª, with the same multiplicity. Plemelj also showed that T = TK is a symmetrizable compact operator, so that, even though it is not self- adjoint, it shares many of the properties of self-adjoint operators. In particular there are no generalized eigenfunctions for non-zero eigenvalues and there is a variational principle similar to the minimax principle for determining the non-zero eigenvalues. If Œª ‚â† 1/2 is an eigenvalue of TK* then Œª is real, with Œª ‚â† ¬± 1/2. Let œÜ be a corresponding eigenfunction and, following Plemelj, set u = S(œÜ). Then the jump formulas imply that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_{n\\\\pm} u =(\\\\lambda \\\\mp{1\\\\over 2})\\\\varphi,} and hence that :\\\\displaystyle{(\\\\lambda +{1\\\\over 2}) \\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\partial_{n+}u \\\\, \\\\overline{u} =(\\\\lambda -{1\\\\over 2}) \\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\partial_{n-}u \\\\, \\\\overline{u}.} Since ‚à´ œÜ = 0, u is harmonic at ‚àû. So by Green's theorem :\\\\displaystyle{(\\\\lambda +{1\\\\over 2}) \\\\iint_{\\\\Omega} u_x^2 + u_y^2 = (\\\\lambda -{1\\\\over 2}) \\\\iint_{\\\\Omega^c} u_x^2 + u_y^2.} If both the integrals vanish then u is constant on Œ© and Œ©c. Since it is continuous and vanishes at ‚àû, it must therefore be identically 0, contradicting œÜ = ‚àÇn+ \\\\- ‚àÇn‚àí. So both integrals are strictly positive and hence Œª must lie in (‚àí¬Ω,¬Ω). Let œÜ be an eigenfunction of TK* with real eigenvalue Œª satisfying 0 < Œª < 1/2. If u = S(œÜ), then on ‚àÇŒ© :\\\\displaystyle{u_+ = u_-,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, {\\\\partial_{n+}u\\\\over \\\\lambda+{1\\\\over 2}}={\\\\partial_{n_-}u\\\\over \\\\lambda -{1\\\\over 2}}=\\\\varphi.} This process can be reversed. Let u be a continuous function on R2 ‚à™ ‚àû which is harmonic on Œ© and Œ©c ‚à™ ‚àû and such that the derivatives of u on Œ© and Œ©c extend continuously to their closures. Suppose that :\\\\displaystyle{{\\\\partial_{n+}u\\\\over \\\\lambda + {1\\\\over 2}}={\\\\partial_{n_-}u\\\\over\\\\lambda - {1\\\\over 2}}=\\\\varphi.} Let œà be the restriction of u to ‚àÇŒ©. Then :\\\\displaystyle{u_\\\\Omega = D(\\\\psi) - (\\\\lambda - {1\\\\over 2})S(\\\\varphi), \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, u_{\\\\Omega^c} = -D(\\\\psi) +(\\\\lambda+{1\\\\over 2})S(\\\\varphi).} The jump formulas for the boundary values and normal derivatives give :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\psi=T\\\\psi +{1\\\\over 2}\\\\psi -(\\\\lambda- {1\\\\over 2})S\\\\varphi=-(T\\\\psi -{1\\\\over 2}\\\\psi) +(\\\\lambda+{1\\\\over 2})S\\\\varphi} and :\\\\displaystyle{(\\\\lambda-{1\\\\over 2})\\\\varphi=\\\\partial_n D(\\\\psi)_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} -(\\\\lambda - {1\\\\over 2})(T^*\\\\varphi-{1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (\\\\lambda +{1\\\\over 2})\\\\varphi=-\\\\partial_n D(\\\\psi)_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} +(\\\\lambda + {1\\\\over 2})(T^*\\\\varphi+{1\\\\over 2}\\\\varphi).} It follows that :\\\\displaystyle{T\\\\psi=\\\\lambda\\\\psi, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, T^*\\\\varphi =\\\\lambda\\\\varphi, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, S\\\\varphi=\\\\psi, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\partial_n D(\\\\psi)_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}=(\\\\lambda^2 -{1\\\\over 4})\\\\varphi,} so that œà and œÜ are eigenfunctions of T and T* with eigenvalue Œª. Let u be a real harmonic function on Œ© extending to a smooth function on its closure. The harmonic conjugate v of u is the unique real function on Œ© such that u + i v is holomorphic. As such it must satisfy the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations: :\\\\displaystyle{u_x=-v_y,\\\\,\\\\, u_y=v_x.} If a is a point in Œ©, a solution is given by :\\\\displaystyle{v(z)=\\\\int_a^z -u_y dx + u_x dy,} where the integral is taken over any path in the closure of Œ©. It is easily verified that vx and vy exist and are given by the corresponding derivatives of u. Thus v is a smooth function on the closure of Œ©, vanishing at 0. By the Cauchy- Riemann equations, f = u + i v is smooth on the closure of Œ©, holomorphic on Œ© and f(a) = 0. Using the inversion map, the same result holds for a harmonic function in Œ©c harmonic at ‚àû. It has a harmonic conjugate v such that f = u + i v extends smoothly to the boundary and f is holomorphic on Œ© ‚à™ ‚àû. Adjusting v by a constant it can be assumed that f(‚àû) = 0. Following , let œÜ be an eigenfunction of TK* with real eigenvalue Œª satisfying 0 < Œª < 1/2. Let u = S(œÜ) and let v¬± be the harmonic conjugates of u¬± in Œ© and Œ©c. Since on ‚àÇŒ© :\\\\displaystyle{u_+ = u_-,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, {\\\\partial_{n+}u\\\\over \\\\lambda-{1\\\\over 2}}={\\\\partial_{n_-}u\\\\over \\\\lambda+{1\\\\over 2}}=\\\\varphi,} the Cauchy-Riemann equations give on ‚àÇŒ© :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_{n+}v=\\\\partial_{n_-}v,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,v_+={\\\\lambda+{1\\\\over 2}\\\\over \\\\lambda - {1\\\\over 2}}\\\\cdot v_-.} Now define :\\\\displaystyle{U_-=v_-, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,U_+={\\\\lambda+{1\\\\over 2}\\\\over \\\\lambda - {1\\\\over 2}}\\\\cdot v_+.} Thus U is continuous on R2 and :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_{n+}U={\\\\lambda-{1\\\\over 2}\\\\over \\\\lambda + {1\\\\over 2}}\\\\cdot \\\\partial_{n_-}U.} It follows that ‚àíŒª is an eigenvalue of T. Since ‚àíu is the harmonic conjugate of v, the process of taking harmonic conjugates is one-one, so the multiplicity of ‚àíŒª as an eigenvalue is the same as that of Œª. By Green's theorem :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\iint_\\\\Omega S(\\\\varphi_1)_x S(\\\\varphi_2)_x + S(\\\\varphi_1)_yS(\\\\varphi_2)_y =\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}S(\\\\varphi_1)\\\\partial_{n-} S(\\\\varphi_2),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\iint_{\\\\Omega^c} S(\\\\varphi_1)_x S(\\\\varphi_2)_x + S(\\\\varphi_1)_yS(\\\\varphi_2)_y =\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}S(\\\\varphi_1)\\\\partial_{n-} S(\\\\varphi_2).} Adding the two integrals and using the jump relations for the single layer potential, it follows that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\iint S(\\\\varphi_1)_x S(\\\\varphi_2)_x + S(\\\\varphi_1)_yS(\\\\varphi_2)_y = \\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} S(\\\\varphi_1)\\\\varphi_2.} Thus :\\\\displaystyle{(S\\\\varphi,\\\\varphi)=\\\\int \\\\ abla S(\\\\phi)\\\\^2, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (S\\\\varphi_1,\\\\varphi_2) = \\\\int abla S(\\\\varphi_1) \\\\cdot \\\\overline{ abla S(\\\\varphi_2)}.} This shows that the operator S is self- adjoint and non-negative on L2(‚àÇŒ©). The image of S is dense (or equivalently it has zero kernel). In fact the relation SH = ¬º I - T2 =(¬Ω I ‚Äì T) (¬Ω I + T) shows that the closure of the image of S contains the image of ¬Ω I ‚Äì T, which has codimension 1. Its orthogonal complement is given by the kernel of T ‚Äì ¬Ω I, i.e. the eigenfunction œà such that T*œà = ¬Ω œà. On the other hand ST=T* S. If the closure of the image is not the whole of L2(‚àÇŒ©) then necessarily Sœà = 0. Hence S{œà) is constant. But then œà = ‚àÇn+S(œà) ‚Äì ‚àÇn‚àíS(œà) = 0, a contradiction. Since S is strictly positive and T satisfies the Plemelj symmetrization relation ST* = TS, the operator T* is a symmetrizable compact operator. The operator S defines a new inner product on L2(‚àÇŒ©): :\\\\displaystyle{(f,g)_S=(Sf,g).} The operator T* is formally self-adjoint with respect to this inner product and by general theory its restriction is bounded and it defines a self-adjoint Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator on the Hilbert space completion. Since T* is formally self-adjoint on this inner product space, it follows immediately that any generalized eigenfunction of T* must already be an eigenfunction. By Fredholm theory, the same is true for T. By general theory the kernel of T and its non-zero eigenspaces span a dense subspace of L2(‚àÇŒ©). The Fredholm determinant is defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Delta(z)=\\\\det (I -zT^2).} It can be expressed in terms of the Fredholm eigenvalues Œªn with modulus less than 1/2, counted with multiplicity, as :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Delta(z)=(1-z/4)\\\\cdot \\\\prod_{n\\\\ge 1} (1-z\\\\lambda_n^2).} Complex Hilbert transform Now define the complex Hilbert transform or conjugate Beurling transform Tc on L2(C) by :\\\\displaystyle{T_c f(w)=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\rightarrow 0} - {1\\\\over \\\\pi } \\\\iint_{z-w\\\\ge \\\\varepsilon} {\\\\overline{f(z)} \\\\over (z-w)^2}\\\\, dx\\\\,dy.} This is a conjugate- linear isometric involution. It commutes with ‚àÇ so carries A2(Œ©) ‚äï A2(Œ©c) onto itself. The compression of Tc to A2(Œ©) is denoted TŒ©. If F is a holomorphic univalent map from the unit disk D onto Œ© then the Bergman space of Œ© and its conjugate can be identified with that of D and TŒ© becomes the conjugate- linear singular integral operator with kernel : K_F(z,w)={F^\\\\prime(z)F^\\\\prime(w)\\\\over (F(z)-F(w))^2}. It defines a contraction. On the other hand it can be checked that TD = 0 by computing directly on powers n using Stokes theorem to transfer the integral to the boundary. It follows that the conjugate-linear operator with kernel :\\\\displaystyle{ {F^\\\\prime(z)F^\\\\prime(w)\\\\over (F(z)-F(w))^2} \\\\,-\\\\,{1\\\\over (z-w)^2}} acts as a contraction on the Bergman space of D. It is thus a Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator. The conjugate-linear operator T = TŒ© satisfies the self-adjointness relation :\\\\displaystyle{(Tu,v)=(Tv,u)} for u, v in A2(Œ©). Thus A = T2 is a compact self-adjoint linear operator on H with :\\\\displaystyle{(Au,u)=(Tu,Tu)=\\\\Tu\\\\^2\\\\ge 0,} so that A is a positive operator. By the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, there is an orthonormal basis un of H consisting of eigenvectors of A: : \\\\displaystyle{Au_n=\\\\mu_n u_n,} where Œºn is non-negative by the positivity of A. Hence : \\\\displaystyle{\\\\mu_n=\\\\lambda_n^2} with Œªn ‚â• 0. Since T commutes with A, it leaves its eigenspaces invariant. The positivity relation shows that it acts trivially on the zero eigenspace. The other non-zero eigenspaces are all finite-dimensional and mutually orthogonal. Thus an orthonormal basis can be chosen on each eigenspace so that: : \\\\displaystyle{Tu_n=\\\\lambda_n u_n.}, and :\\\\displaystyle{ T(iu_n)=-\\\\lambda_n iu_n} by conjugate-linearity of T. Connection with Hilbert transform on a closed curve The Neumann‚ÄìPoincar√© operator is defined on real functions f as :\\\\displaystyle{Tf(w)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}\\\\partial_n (\\\\logz-w) f(z)={1\\\\over 2}\\\\Re (Hf)(w),} where H is the Hilbert transform on ‚àÇŒ©. Let J denote complex conjugation. Writing h = f + ig, :\\\\displaystyle{2Th =\\\\Re(Hf) + i\\\\Re(Hg)={1\\\\over 2} (Hf +JHf +iHg +iJHg)={1\\\\over 2}(H+JHJ)h} so that :\\\\displaystyle{T={1\\\\over 4} (H +JHJ),} The imaginary part of the Hilbert transform can be used to establish the symmetry properties of the eigenvalues of TK. Let :\\\\displaystyle{A={1\\\\over 2} (H+JHJ),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, B={1\\\\over 2i} (H-JHJ),} so that :\\\\displaystyle{H=A+iB.} Then :\\\\displaystyle{AB=-BA,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,A^2-B^2 =I.} The Cauchy idempotent E satisfies E1 = 1 = E*1. Since J1 = 1, it follows that E and E* leave invariant L20(‚àÇŒ©), the functions orthogonal to constant functions. The same is also true of A = 2 TK and B. Let A1 and B1 be their restrictions. Since 1 is an eigenvector of TK with eigenvalue 1/2 and multiplicity one and TK \\\\+ ¬Ω I is invertible, :\\\\displaystyle{A_1^2 -I =B_1^2} is invertible, so that B1 is invertible. The equation A1B1 = ‚àí B1 A1 implies that if Œª is an eigenvalue of A1 then so is ‚àíŒª and they have the same multiplicity. Eigenfunctions of complex Hilbert transform The links between the Neumann‚ÄìPoincar√© operator and geometric function theory appeared first in . The precise relationship between single and double layer potentials, Fredholm eigenvalues and the complex Hilbert transform is explained in detail in . Briefly given a smooth Jordan curve, the complex derivatives of its single and double layer potentials are ‚àí1 and +1 eigenfunctions of the complex Hilbert transform.See also:   * Let ùï≥ be the direct sum :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{H}=\\\\mathfrak{H}(\\\\overline{\\\\Omega})\\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{H}(\\\\overline{\\\\Omega^c}),} where the first space consists of functions smooth on the closure of Œ© and harmonic on Œ©; and the second consists of functions smooth on the closure of Œ©c, harmonic on Œ©c and at ‚âà. The space ùï≥ is naturally an inner product space with corresponding norm given by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\f_-\\\\oplus f_+\\\\_{\\\\mathfrak{H}}^2=\\\\iint_\\\\Omega  abla f_-^2 + \\\\iint_{\\\\Omega^c}  abla f_+^2.} Each element of ùï≥ can be written uniquely as the restriction of the sum of a double layer and single layer potential, provided that the moments are normalized to have 0 integral on ‚àÇŒ©. Thus for f‚àí ‚äï f+ in ùï≥, there are unique œÜ, œà in C‚àû(‚àÇŒ©) with integral 0 such that :\\\\displaystyle{f_-=D(\\\\varphi)_{\\\\Omega} + S(\\\\psi)_\\\\Omega,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, f_+=D(\\\\varphi)_{\\\\Omega^c} + S(\\\\psi)_{\\\\Omega^c}.} Under this correspondence :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi=f_-_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} - f_+_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\psi=\\\\partial_{n}f_-_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} -\\\\partial_{n} f_+_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}.} The layer potentials can be identified with their images in ùï≥: :\\\\displaystyle{D(\\\\varphi)=D(\\\\varphi)_\\\\Omega \\\\oplus D(\\\\varphi)_{\\\\Omega^c},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, S(\\\\psi)=S(\\\\psi)_\\\\Omega \\\\oplus S(\\\\psi)_{\\\\Omega^c}.} The space of double layer potentials is orthogonal to the space of single layer potentials for the inner product. In fact by Green's theorem :\\\\displaystyle{(S,D)=\\\\iint_{\\\\Omega \\\\cup \\\\Omega^c} abla S\\\\cdot abla D= -\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} S\\\\partial_n D + \\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} S\\\\partial_n D=0.} Define an isometric embedding of ùï≥R in L2(C) by :\\\\displaystyle{U(f_- \\\\oplus f_+) =(\\\\partial_{z} f_-)\\\\chi_\\\\Omega + (\\\\partial_{z} f_-)\\\\chi_{\\\\Omega^c}.} The image lies in A2(Œ©) ‚äï A2(Œ©c), the direct sum of the Bergman spaces of square integrable holomorphic functions on Œ© and Œ©c. Since polynomials in z are dense in A2(Œ©) and polynomials in z‚àí1 without constant term are dense in A2(Œ©c), the image of U is dense in A2(Œ©) ‚äï A2(Œ©c). It can be verified directly that for œÜ, œà realSee: * * :\\\\displaystyle{T_c(U(D(\\\\varphi) + S(\\\\psi)))=U(D(\\\\varphi)-S(\\\\psi)).} In fact for single layer potentials, applying Green's theorem on the domain Œ© ‚à™ Œ©c with a small closed disk of radius Œµ removed around a point w of the domain, it follows that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\iint_{\\\\Omega\\\\cup\\\\Omega^c, \\\\,\\\\, z-w >\\\\varepsilon} abla N(w-z) \\\\cdot abla S(\\\\psi)(z) \\\\,dx\\\\, dy=-\\\\int_{z-w =\\\\varepsilon} \\\\partial_n N(z-w)\\\\,S(\\\\psi)(z)=-S(\\\\psi)(z),} since the mean of a harmonic function over a circle is its value at the centre. Using the fact that ‚àí1 is the fundamental solution for ‚àÇw, this can be rewritten as :\\\\displaystyle{{1\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\,\\\\iint_{\\\\Omega\\\\cup\\\\Omega^c}{\\\\overline{\\\\partial_z S(\\\\psi)(z)}\\\\over z-w}\\\\,dx\\\\,dy= -S(\\\\psi)(w).} Applying ‚àÇw to both sides gives :\\\\displaystyle{T_c(\\\\partial_z S(\\\\psi)) = -\\\\partial_z S(\\\\psi).} Similarly for a double layer potential : \\\\displaystyle{\\\\iint_{\\\\Omega\\\\cup\\\\Omega^c, \\\\,\\\\, z-w >\\\\varepsilon} abla N(w-z) \\\\cdot abla D(\\\\varphi)(z) \\\\,dx\\\\, dy=\\\\int_{z-w =\\\\varepsilon} N(z-w)\\\\,\\\\partial_n D(\\\\varphi)(z)=0,} since the mean of the normal derivative of a harmonic function over a circle is zero. As above, using the fact ‚àí1 is the fundamental solution for ‚àÇw, this can be rewritten in terms of complex derivatives as :\\\\displaystyle{{1\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\,\\\\iint_{\\\\Omega\\\\cup\\\\Omega^c}{\\\\overline{\\\\partial_z D(\\\\varphi)(z)}\\\\over z-w}\\\\,dx\\\\,dy= D(\\\\varphi)(w).} Applying ‚àÇw to both sides, :\\\\displaystyle{T_c(\\\\partial_z D(\\\\varphi)) = \\\\partial_z D(\\\\varphi).} Connection with Hilbert transform on a domain Let L2(‚àÇŒ©)0 be the closed subspace of L2(‚àÇŒ©) orthogonal to the constant functions. Let P0 the orthogonal projection onto L2(‚àÇŒ©)0 and set :\\\\displaystyle{T_{K,0}=P_0 T_K P_0.} With respect to the new inner product on L2(‚àÇŒ©)0 :\\\\displaystyle{(f,g)_0=((1/2-T_K)^{-1}Sf,g)} the operator TK,0 is formally self-adjoint. Let H0 be the Hilbert space completion. Define a unitary operator V from H0 onto A2(Œ©) by :\\\\displaystyle{V(\\\\psi)=U(D(\\\\varphi)+S(\\\\psi))_{\\\\Omega},} where :\\\\displaystyle{({1\\\\over 2} I-T_K)\\\\varphi= -S\\\\psi.} Then :\\\\displaystyle{VT_{K,0}V^*=T_\\\\Omega.} Fredholm eigenfunctions If œÜ is an eigenfunction of TK on ‚àÇŒ© corresponding to an eigenvalue Œª with Œª < 1/2, then œÜ is orthogonal to the constants and can be taken real-valued.See:  Let :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi_-=\\\\partial_z D(\\\\varphi)_\\\\Omega \\\\in A^2(\\\\Omega),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\Phi_+=\\\\partial_z D(\\\\varphi)_{\\\\Omega^c}\\\\in A^2(\\\\Omega^c).} Since double potentials are harmonic, given as the real part of a holomorphic function, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi_{\\\\pm}(w)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} {\\\\varphi(z)\\\\over (z-w)^2} \\\\,dz.} Then :\\\\displaystyle{T_\\\\Omega \\\\Phi_-=\\\\lambda \\\\Phi_-,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, T_{\\\\Omega^c} \\\\Phi_+=\\\\lambda \\\\Phi_+.} Moreover :\\\\displaystyle{(T_c \\\\Phi_-)_{\\\\Omega^c}= (\\\\lambda + {1\\\\over 2})\\\\Phi_+,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(T_c \\\\Phi_+)_{\\\\Omega}=(\\\\lambda-{1\\\\over 2})\\\\Phi_-.} If two eigenfunctions œÜ and œà are orthogonal for the inner product defined by S, then their transforms Œ¶¬± and Œ®¬± are orthogonal in A2(Œ©) and A2(Œ©c). Eigenfunctions in Hardy space The Hardy space H2(‚àÇŒ©) can be defined as the closure of the complex polynomials in z in L2(‚àÇŒ©). The Cauchy transform of f in H2(‚àÇŒ©) :\\\\displaystyle{F(w)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} {f(z)\\\\over z-w}\\\\, dz} defines a holomorphic function F in Œ© such that its restrictions to the level curves ‚àÇŒ©s in a tubular neighbourhood of ‚àÇŒ© have uniformly bounded L2 norms. The classical definition of Hardy space is of holomorphic functions on Œ© with this property. Identifying the level curves with ‚àÇŒ©, it follows that the restrictions of F tend to f in L2 norm. Writing H2(Œ©) for the classical Hardy space, identified with H2(‚àÇŒ©) by taking L2 boundary values, it follows that Hardy space H2(Œ©) is a dense subspace of Bergman space A2(Œ©). Define the conjugate Cauchy transform of f by :\\\\displaystyle{Cf(w)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} {\\\\overline{f(z)}\\\\over z-w}\\\\, d\\\\overline{z}.} It lies in H2(Œ©). Moreover for w in Œ© :\\\\displaystyle{Cf(w)=T_\\\\Omega F(w),} since by Green's theorem :\\\\displaystyle{{1\\\\over \\\\pi}\\\\iint_{\\\\Omega,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,z-w>\\\\varepsilon} {\\\\overline{F(z)}\\\\over (z-w)^2} \\\\,dx\\\\,dy = Cf(w) -{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_{z-w=\\\\varepsilon} {\\\\overline{F(z)}\\\\over z-w}\\\\, d\\\\overline{z}=Cf(w).} For a smooth Jordan curve ‚àÇŒ©, the Fredholm eigenfunctions of TŒ© all lie in H2(Œ©).

The largely-mechanical IBM 421 read 80-column punch cards and could print upper- case letters of the alphabet, the decimal digits 0 to 9, a period (.), and plus and minus signs. The operation of the 421 was directed by the use of a removable control panel and a carriage tape. By means of the control panel, any column of the card could be wired to any print column, by means of a wire link (the end terminals of which were manually inserted into slots in the control panel). After manual wiring, the control panel was inserted in the side of the machine, and a hand-operated lever moved the control panel so that the wire links made contact with corresponding terminals in the machine. The 421 had 64 positions of memory, typically used to store data from a leading punch card. There were also three external program switches (Minor, Major and Super Major) that were used to alter the function of the plug board Program Selectors. IBM 421 uses included: # Tabulating (listing) punch cards # Calculating totals # Calculating grand totals. 421s sold in the UK could total pre-1970 currency with twenty shillings to the pound and 12 pennies to the shilling. A UK 1964-onwards example of commercial use was 421s in multiple South Eastern Electric Board locations calculating and printing the quarterly electricity bill (in pounds, shillings and pence) for each of its thousands of customers after the 421 had read three punched cards for each customer: # Name and address card # The \\"old\\" meter reading card # The ‚Äúnew‚Äù meter reading card. A 421 could be cable-attached to a \\"Summary\\" or \\"Gang Punch\\" (IBM 514?) to punch cards with summary totals calculated by the 421. The printing speed was about 100 lines per minute. When calculating totals, printing was suppressed and the machine read cards faster at about 150 cards per minute. There was one type bar for each print column. Each type bar had every character in the available set. When printing a column of a card, the type bar was raised until the desired character was in position at the current line, and then the type bar was hit by a \\"hammer\\", thus impressing the character onto the paper. The entire line was printed simultaneously (that is, all hammers struck simultaneously). An interesting use of the machine was the evaluation of polynomials.

It has 21 subsidiaries at 33 sites in Switzerland, Europe and International. The business activities include project development, general planning and consultancy tasks in building construction and infrastructure development, safety consulting, renovation, project management and controlling. The Gruner Group has over 1000 employees from over 50 different professions. History Carl Heinrich Gruner Gruner AG headquarters in Gellertstrasse, Basel Citygate completed in 2010 as the second site in Basel It was founded in 1862 by Carl Heinrich Gruner in Basel with a focus on water supply. He specialized in setting up gas stations and urban water utilities. The era of hydraulic engineering was started by Henry Eduard Gruner under the name of \\"Ingenieurb√ºro Dr. Gruner\\" in 1898. The next 40 years, the company was almost exclusively involved in the field of hydraulic engineering, hydropower plants and high dams worldwide. In the 1930s, his son, Edward Gruner drafted the idea of the Gotthard Base Tunnel, which he published in 1947 in his essay titled \\"Journey through the Gotthard Base Tunnel.\\" George Gruner, the grandson of the founder, joined the office in 1938. This marked the onset of civil engineering activities in construction works. In 1942 was the foundation of Ingenieurb√ºro Dr. HE Gruner + Sohn (Engineering Office). In 1948, the company was renamed to Gebr√ºder Gruner, following the death of their father, Henry. This was followed by civil engineering work. In 1950, transportation planning was included as a new business area. In 1970, the company was restructured into a corporation (Gruner AG). In 1974 was the establishment of the subsidiary, Gruneko AG, which focused on energy economics and covered the areas of facilities engineering and energy installations. In 1979, B√∂hringer AG became part of the Gruner Group in the business areas of local and regional civil engineering, utilities and waste management. 1980 witnessed the establishment of the Environmental Division. The companies, Tausky Leu M√ºller, Heinzelmann AG and Uli Lippuner AG became members of the Gruner Group between 1985 and 1990. In 1992, the subsidiary, L√ºem AG was founded. In 1993, Gruner + Partner GmbH was founded in Leipzig. In the year 2000 was the establishment of the General Planning and Safety Divisions. The subsidiary, Tausky Leu Mueller, Bauingenieure AG was renamed to Gruner AG Ingenieure und Planer (Consulting Engineers) in 2001. Frey Strub AG became a subsidiary of Heinzelmann AG in 2001. Heinzelmann AG was renamed to Gruner Ingenieure AG in 2005. Likewise, in 2005, Berchtold + Eicher Bauingenieure AG became a member of the Gruner Group. Roschi + Partner AG, operating in facilities engineering and energy consultancy, was integrated into the Gruner Group in 2006. The companies of the Wepf Group were merged with Gruner + Wepf Ingenieure AG, St. Gallen and Gruner + Wepf Ingenieure AG, Zurich in 2008. Similarly, Gruner GmbH was founded in Vienna to increase its presence in Austria. The engineering firm, H. Tanner became a subsidiary of Gruner AG Ingenieure AG in 2009. That same year, Gruner International Ltd. was established to enhance international business. Kiwi Systemingenieure und Berater AG became a member of the Gruner Group in 2011. With the founding of Gruner Peru S.A.C. in Lima, the Group gains its first foothold in Peru. In 2012 the Gruner Group celebrates 150 years in business. In 2013 Stucky SA is integrated into the Gruner Group. The two time-honoured companies have historical links: Alfred Stucky, who founded the engineering company bearing his name in 1926, worked at Gruner in Basel from 1917 to 1923, first as an assistant and later as head engineer and joint partner. In the same year Gruner establishes a company in Stuttgart for the provision of fire safety solutions: Gruner GmbH Stuttgart. In 2014 the member companies of the Gruner Group in locations all around the world all operate under the Gruner brand, with the exception of Stucky SA.History, Gruner AG website, accessed on 09/07/2014.

They were tank engine versions of the NER C1 Class 0-6-0, using both simple expansion (Class B1) and also the von Borries configuration for two-cylinder compound locomotives (Class B). Both types were later rebuilt using saturated steam and the compounds were also rebuilt as simple expansion locomotives, and eventually formed a single class (albeit with variations in dimensions). Many of the superheated locomotives were also later returned to saturated steam as their original boilers wore out. As a result the classes have had a very complex history mechanical history. B1 Class The first batch of ten locomotives were built at Darlington Works between June and November 1886. They had Joy valve gear and slide valves. They were originally designated Class B, but after 1888 were designated B1 class to differentiate them from the compound locomotives. They were given numbers which filled gaps in the sequence between 14 and 1165. An eleventh locomotive of the same design (No. 74) was built at Gateshead Railway Works in March 1888 for the purposes of comparison with a compound version built two months earlier (see below under B class). All of these locomotives were rebuilt (sometimes on more than one occasion) by Wilson Worsdell and/or Vincent Raven between 1893 and 1924. Seven of the eleven were fitted with larger cylinders, Stephenson valve gear and piston valves, raising the weight to . Six out of these seven were also fitted with superheating between 1919 and 1930, raising the weight to , although in two of these cases they were returned to saturated steam in 1941 and 1944. B Class One similar locomotive (No. 9) was constructed at Gateshead in January 1888, but fitted with the Von Borries compounding system. Its performance was tested against another new-built member of the B1 class (No.74) . As a result of these trials a further fifty were ordered., eleven of which were built at Gateshead between October and December 1888, and the remainder at Darlington between December 188 and May 1890. They were given numbers which filled gaps in the sequence between 136 and 1168. All of these locomotives were rebuilt (sometimes on more than one occasion) by Wilson Worsdell and/or Vincent Raven between 1904 and 1911, when they were returned to simple locomotives and reclassified B1. Some members of the class retained their original cylinders and Joy valve gear, whilst other were fitted with larger cylinders, or cylinders with Stephenson valve gear and piston valves. As with the other members of the B1 class many of the locomotives were with superheating between 1916 and 1927, although in several cases they were returned to saturated steam between 1941 and 1950. All members of the B and B1 classes were reclassified as one single class N8 by the LNER (despite the variations in dimensions and valve gear. They were withdrawn between 1929 and 1956.

A former cultural attach√© during the 1990s in the Franjo Tudjman government, his documentaries promote Croatian nationalist views through propaganda. His 2016 documentary Jasenovac ‚Äì The Truth sparked controversy and condemnation for downplaying and denying the crimes committed at the Jasenovac concentration camp by the Usta≈°e during World War II, instead focusing on crimes supposedly committed against Croats by communist partisans at the camp following the war, while using alleged misinformation and forgeries to present its case, in addition to naming former and current Croatian officials, intellectuals, historians and journalists it dubs as \\"Yugoslav nationalists concealing the truth\\".  Biography  Sedlar was born in Split, SR Croatia, Yugoslavia in 1952. In 1972, he moved to Zagreb, where he studied Yugoslav languages, literature and philosophy at the University of Zagreb. After his graduation in 1977, he enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied theatre and film directing, graduating in 1981. He started to play water polo in Split in 1966 and soon became a member of Jadran's first team and a candidate for the national team. He played 34 games for the Yugoslav youth national team. In 1972 he transferred from Jadran to Zagreb-based Mladost, the world's best water polo club at the time. As the club in Split refused to give him a discharge letter (he would have had no problem obtaining the letter had he accepted the offer to play for any Belgrade-based club), he was not allowed to play in the Yugoslav water polo league for three years. During that time, Sedlar was allowed to play only international games; in 1975, he won the LEN Cup Winners' Cup with Mladost and the Super Cup (winning against Belgrade- based Partizan in Ljubljana 11:10). He ended his sports career in 1989. In 1992, the newly elected director of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb Georgij Paro appointed Sedlar drama director. During his four-year-term the repertoire included plays by Shakespeare, Moli√®re, Krle≈æa, Bre≈°an, Marinkoviƒá and Goldoni, directed by renowned Croatian directors like Kosta Spajiƒá, Georgij Paro, Bo≈æidar Violiƒá and Ivica Kunƒçeviƒá. He took the drama ensemble on three world tours (Europe, USA and Canada, South America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand). Sedlar was the Croatian Government's \\"official propagandist\\" during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, according to the historian Vjekoslav Perica. Sedlar became known for films such as Gospa (Madonna) and ƒåetverored (Four by Four), which portray the events of World War II and the Cold War from a Croatian nationalist perspective. He also made a number of documentaries glorifying wartime President Franjo Tuƒëman and his party, the right-wing Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska Demokratska zajednica; HDZ). In an apparent bid to increase their credibility abroad, several were filmed in the English language, with actor Martin Sheen narrating. In 1996, Tuƒëman persuaded him to accept the post of the first cultural attach√© in the US (New York), where he remained until 2000. During that time, he launched various projects and organized numerous events to promote Croatian culture. Joe Tripician, who was hired to write the official biography of Tuƒëman and co-directed the documentary Tudjman with Sedlar (though Tripician claims he barely worked on the film and was shocked when he saw his name on it), describes Sedlar as \\"The Leni Riefenstahl of Croatia ‚Äî but without the talent.\\" After his return from the US in 2000, the newly elected coalition government demoted Sedlar. Today, he is employed as a media consultant at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb.  Professional work  In the course of his career Sedlar directed 28 plays in professional theatres and ensembles in Zagreb, Dubrovnik, Sarajevo, Novi Sad, Sombor, Tuzla, Maribor and Mostar. He was awarded for directing the best play of the Gavella Evenings Festival in 1982 (The Gin Game, starring Mirko Vojkoviƒá and Vjera ≈Ωagar-Nardelli), and in 1983 at the Small Scenes Festival in Nova Gorica (Slovenia) for the play Bent which starred Vicko Ruiƒá, ≈Ωeljko Vukmirica and Boris Miholjeviƒá. His version of Macbeth was proclaimed the best visiting performance in Australia in 1996. He has staged plays in Europe, the United states, Canada, South America, Australia and New Zealand. Controversies Sedlar was criticized for nationalism and politicization in his films. On 4 April 2016 his documentary Jasenovac - The Truth premiered. The documentary is about the alleged crimes committed by the communist authorities of the SFR Yugoslavia in the Jasenovac concentration camp between 1945 and 1951 following the Second World War, which, as claimed in the documentary, were covered up. The film also downplays and denies the extent of The Holocaust in Croatia and the World War II-era Genocide of Serbs in Croatia, contending that the number of victims were exaggerated through post- war Yugoslavian communist propaganda. At the end of the documentary, Sedlar leaves the alleged communist crimes, moves to the modern era and mentions various leftists who allegedly \\"cover up communist crimes\\" (naming Presidents Stjepan Mesiƒá and Ivo Josipoviƒá, and Serb MP Milorad Pupovac) as well as various journalists who allegedly help them (Miljenko Jergoviƒá, Jurica Paviƒçiƒá, Ante Tomiƒá, Davor Butkoviƒá and others), which was considered tendentious and irrelevant to the theme of the documentary, as well as a way of labeling people he considered inadequate. Slavko Goldstein said that the documentary was \\"full of half-truths, lies and forgeries\\", and that the end in which some public figures are named was a \\"direct arrest warrant and indictment against individuals.\\" Vladimir Matijaniƒá wrote for the Slobodna Dalmacija that the documentary \\"does not prove that after the liberation, the partisans carried out mass executions of the prisoners, or that the Jasenovac concentration camp was solely 'working and internment camp'\\" (as claimed in the documentary). Another controversy connected to the documentary is the alleged title in the Vjesnik newspaper from 1945 stating that corpses tossed into the Sava were reaching Zagreb from the direction of Jasenovac. Shortly after the premiere, journalist Lovro Krniƒá went through the Zagreb state archives and examined all the May 1945 issues of Vjesnik and found that no such headline existed. Upon closer inspection, Krniƒá discovered that the headline seen in the documentary had been crudely doctored, likely using Photoshop. Attorney Veljko Miljeviƒá stated that Sedlar could end up in prison due to charges of falsification, denial of crime and hate speech against politicians and journalists.

He traveled through the American West and held a variety of jobs related to film, including working at a movie theater in Omaha, Nebraska, where he showed The Battle of Manila by Thomas Edison during the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898. Throughout this time, he was interested in reducing the size of the film projection equipment he worked with. In 1910, he began working as a cameraman for the Industrial Film Company, owned by Watterson Rothacker, in Chicago, Illinois.

Founded by Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears and Eric Crozier in 1947 as an organisation to present the first Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts in 1948. Each year Aldeburgh Music promotes the Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts, the Snape Proms, concert series at Easter and October, together with a year-round performance programme at Snape Maltings Concert Hall and other venues on the Snape site. The Britten‚ÄìPears Young Artist Programme ‚Äì formerly known as the Britten‚ÄìPears School of Advanced Musical Studies ‚Äì provides development opportunities for musicians early in their professional lives, between the ages of 18 and 25. Aldeburgh Young Musicians offers a programme of music mentoring for children from 8 to 18, who are of exceptional potential. Aldeburgh Education offers an annual programme of work involving the wider community, while Aldeburgh Residencies provides opportunities for established artists to develop their creative talents. History While touring with the English Opera Group in Europe in 1947, the composer Benjamin Britten, tenor Peter Pears and producer Eric Crozier developed the idea of a music festival in Aldeburgh, where Britten had a house on Crag Path.Benjamin Britten, A Biography by Humphrey Carpenter, 1992 An executive committee was formed under the chairmanship of the Countess of Cranbrook and the first meeting took place at Thelluson Lodge, Aldeburgh on 27 October 1947.Time & Concord, Aldeburgh Festival Recollections, edited Jenni Wake-Walker The first Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts was held from 5 to 12 June 1948 under the Artistic Direction of Britten, Pears and Crozier, with the Earl of Harewood as President and Elizabeth Sweeting as general manager. Needing to expand the Festival into larger premises, in 1967, the Festival management acquired a lease on disused Victorian buildings at Snape Maltings, and converted the largest of the redundant malthouses into Snape Maltings Concert Hall. The Snape Maltings Foundation Ltd was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee, no. 980281, on 21 May 1970 under the name of Snape Maltings Foundation Ltd. to manage the Snape buildings and develop further buildings on the site.See 1971 Aldeburgh Festival Programme Book The initial subscribers were Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears, Imogen Holst, Fidelity, Countess of Cranbrook, Marion, Countess of Harewood, Charles Gifford and The Lord Goodman. The company was registered with the Charity Commission as the Aldeburgh Foundation, registration number 261383, on 23 July 1970.See Charity Commission website, accessed 16 August 2012 The company changed its name to Aldeburgh Festival‚ÄìSnape Maltings Foundation Ltd (known as AF-SMF) on 7 September 1976, and to Aldeburgh Foundation on 12 October 1983. In November 1997, the name of the company was changed to Aldeburgh Productions, and in July 2006 to its current name of Aldeburgh Music. Background and ethos Following its successful launch in 1948, the Aldeburgh Festival expanded year by year until it outgrew the available venues in the town. When redundant malting buildings in Snape became available in 1965, an initial 25-year lease was taken on the largest of the Victorian malthouses, and it was converted by Arup Associates (architects and engineers) and Wm. C. Reade (builders) into Snape Maltings Concert Hall. The 820-seat Hall was opened by HM The Queen on 2 June 1967. From that date, the main events of the annual Festival were re-located to Snape. A major fire in 1969 led to the re-development of the site, re-opening the following year, and gradually what was once a Concert Hall for a three- week Festival, became a year-round venue, including the introduction in the 1980s of the annual Snape Proms. From the very beginning, part of the artistic vision of the original directors had been the development of young musical talent. As early as 1953, Britten and Pears, committed to the musical development of young people, formed the idea of having a school of music at Snape.Imogen Holst, A Life in Music edited by Christopher Grogan, 2007 The fundamental concept was ‚Äúto prepare and promote young singers or string players for professional life at the very highest level.‚Äù It took until September 1972 for the first masterclasses to be given, by Pears, and in 1975 a Snape Maltings Training Orchestra rehearsed and performed at the Hall for the first time. Following the death of Britten in 1976, the Benjamin Britten Memorial Appeal was launched, and the barley store adjacent to the Concert Hall was converted by Arup Associates into the Britten‚ÄìPears School for Advanced Musical Studies.Benjamin Britten, his life and operas by Eric Walter White, 1983 Opened on 28 April 1979 by the patron of the Aldeburgh Foundation, HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, the School incorporated a 120-seat recital room (today named the Peter Pears Recital Room), a top-floor Seminar Room, with many practice rooms in between and a reference library, the Holst Library. Over the years, such artists as Dame Joan Sutherland, Ann Murray, Sir Thomas Allen, Galina Vishnevskaya, Murray Perahia, Sir Charles McKerras, Elisabeth S√∂derstr√∂m and Dawn Upshaw as well as Pears himself have been notable teachers, while its many alumni have included Thomas Ad√®s, Ian Bostridge, Simon Keenlyside and Dame Felicity Lott. From the beginning, the Festival was committed to working with and for its local community, breaking down the barriers between amateur and professional. Education and working with young people always featured, and this continues today with Aldeburgh Education involving the local community as creators and performers as well as audiences. The department now runs 3 year-round programmes and in 2011/12 delivered 432 sessions, with over 15,000 participants, over 17,000 audience members and 147 artists. In 2012 the annual Celebration of Schools‚Äô Music, presented in association with Suffolk County Council, celebrated its 25th year at Snape Maltings Concert Hall. Aldeburgh Residencies was launched in 2003 to offer bespoke development opportunities to established artists. The Residencies enable individuals and ensembles to come to Snape to create new work, develop new partnerships and explore new possibilities. Aldeburgh Young Musicians is a Centre for Advanced Training (CAT), created in 2007 with funding from the government to provide advanced music mentoring for exceptionally talented young musicians aged between 8 and 18 based in the Eastern Region. The growth of the work of Aldeburgh Music led to the need for more accommodation, and further semi-derelict buildings adjacent to the Concert Hall on the Snape Maltings site were acquired in 2006 on a 999-year lease, and the Aldeburgh Music Development Plan launched to raise the money necessary for their conversion. Following a successful ¬£16 million fund- raising campaign, a new Creative Campus was opened in May 2009, designed by architects Haworth Tompkins. The Hoffmann Building contains the Britten Studio (capacity 340), the Jerwood Kiln Studio (capacity 80) and a number of rehearsal spaces. The Britten‚ÄìPears Building has been redeveloped and now incorporates the Trask Artists‚Äô Cafe. A small studio has been created out of the derelict Victorian Dovecote. In Aldeburgh, the Pumphouse, Aldeburgh Music‚Äôs small alternative venue, has been redeveloped. Aldeburgh Music Today The Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts remains at the core of Aldeburgh Music‚Äôs annual programme. The current Artistic Director of the Aldeburgh Festival is Pierre-Laurent Aimard. Traditionally starting on the second Friday in June and running for 17 days, events are presented not only in the various venues at Snape Maltings, but in all the traditional Festival venues such as Aldeburgh Parish Church, Orford Church, Blythburgh Church and the Festival‚Äôs original home, Aldeburgh‚Äôs Jubilee Hall. Site-specific events have taken place elsewhere, such as Sizewell Beach (Everlasting Night, 2011), Leiston Long Shop Museum (Before Life and After, 2012), RAF Bentwaters Airbase (Faster than Sound), and community events on the beach. In 2012 there were 74 events in the main festival, with a further 24 events at The Pumphouse. The Pumphouse, situated off the marshes on the outskirts of the town, provides an informal, alternative performance venue. Although Britten‚Äôs work always features in the Festival ‚Äì and played a large role in 2013, his centenary year ‚Äì it by no means dominates the programme, which continues to commission and present new work from contemporary composers, as well as exploring themes across many genres. In 2012, the Festival‚Äôs Artist in Residence was composer- conductor Oliver Knussen, a former Artistic Director of the Festival, and featured works by Helmut Lachenmann. Previous contemporary composers to be examined in depth in recent festivals include Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and Marco Stroppa (2011), George Benjamin and Pierre Boulez (2010), Harrison Birtwistle and Elliott Carter (2009) and Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g (2008). Festivals also include work by the Britten‚ÄìPears Young Artist Programme, including Britten‚ÄìPears Alumni. A programme of fringe events takes place at The Pumphouse in Aldeburgh. =Snape Proms= The Snape Proms take place throughout August each year in the Concert Hall. Some seats in the main block are removed, and audiences sit on cushions on the floor. With a different concert each evening throughout the month, the Proms present an eclectic range of music, including classical, jazz, folk and world music, and incorporate comedy and poetry. =Easter Festival= An Easter Festival is mounted each year, together with an autumn weekend generally themed around the work of Benjamin Britten. =Britten‚ÄìPears Young Artist Programme= Since the very first course in 1972, over 10,000 young artists have attended what started as the Britten‚ÄìPears School for Advanced Musical Studies, and is now called the Britten‚ÄìPears Young Artist Programme. Masterclasses for singers, ensembles, instrumentalists and composers are held from March until October. There are also opportunities for emerging young professional musicians to work with conductors, soloists and orchestral principals in both the Britten‚ÄìPears Orchestra and the Britten‚ÄìPears Baroque Orchestra. Many of the masterclasses are open to the public, and each course culminates in a public performance, including at the Aldeburgh Festival and Snape Proms. Auditions are held across the world, now using modern technology to access countries on the other side of the globe. In 2012, the Britten-Pears Orchestra was conducted by Antonello Manacorda, performing Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony at Snape Maltings Concert Hall at Easter. Previous conductors of the BPO include Edward Gardner, Oliver Knussen, Kirill Karabits, Vasily Petrenko and Robin Ticciati. The Britten‚ÄìPears Baroque Orchestra, formed in 1992, is formed each year to work on baroque repertoire, and previous tutors have included period specialists Richard Egarr, Emmanuelle Ha√Øm, Laurence Cummings, Andreas Scholl and Harry Bicket. They presented Rameau‚Äôs Na√Øs as part of the 2012 Snape Proms under Christophe Rousset. In 2012, as part of the Cultural Olympiad, the Aldeburgh World Orchestra was formed, conducted by Sir Mark Elder. Young musicians from across the globe submitted their auditions on YouTube, and an international ensemble of around 124 young musicians came to Suffolk to train and perform both in the Concert Hall in Snape and as part of the BBC Promenade Concert season at the Royal Albert Hall, as well as on a short European tour. In 2012, Aldeburgh Strings have been created to perform under the baton of Markus D√§urnet at the 2012 Britten Weekend, the programme included Britten‚Äôs Prelude and Fugue, Lachrymae and In memoriam Dennis Brain. Singers are auditioned for song recital courses, and recent courses have included American and French song with Dawn Upshaw. Singers and orchestra come together to perform opera; recent productions have included Death in Venice and Albert Herring, and Poulenc‚Äôs Les Mamelles de Tiresias in Britten‚Äôs arrangement. On Easter 2012, the programme presented Purcell‚Äôs Dido and Aeneas under the direction of Christian Curnyn. Each year there is a digital media course, called New Music/New Media. In September 2012, the course was led by Rolf Wallin, Tansy Davies, and Alexander Refsum Jensenius, co-founder of the Oslo Laptop Orchestra. String quartets come together each spring and present a weekly recital of ‚Äúwork-in-progress‚Äù at the Jubilee Hall, and in late summer the International Academy of String Quartets provides further opportunities for working on repertoire. Menahem Pressler, Pierre-Laurent Aimard and the Arditti Quartet have all taught masterclasses. =Aldeburgh Residencies= Aldeburgh Residencies are designed for established musicians and other artists. It is intended for the development of specific creative projects, each generally lasting for a week ‚Äì longer, sometimes, in the case of composers. Groups or individuals are generally funded by Aldeburgh Music for their accommodation, food and travel, and are expected to allow some public access to the work being undertaken. This may be in the form of an informal Open Session performance, but may also be a full performance in an upcoming Aldeburgh Festival or concert series. Residencies are supported by the John Ellerman Foundation. Recent artists to benefit from an Aldeburgh Residency include Mark Padmore, Gwyneth Herbert, Netia Jones and Pippa Nissen, I Fagiolini, Exaudi, Alex Wilson (working on a new collaboration with two Malian musicians, preparing for a tour and new CD), the Aurora Orchestra, Mitsuko Uchida and Katie Mitchell. A particular strand of Aldeburgh Residencies entitled the Composer Residency Scheme enables three composers each year to spend three weeks working on individual new projects. Amongst the composers and librettists participating in this programme have been Anna Meredith, Larry Groves, Simon Limbrick, Mark Ravenhill and Conor Mitchell, Man Fang, Tansy Davies, Christian Mason and Charlotte Bray. James Boyd developed a programme entitled Sea Change during an Aldeburgh Residency, inspiring new repertoire for guitar and voice by Elspeth Brooke and Jonathan Dove, presented at the 2012 Aldeburgh Festival. Other work developed during Aldeburgh Residencies performed at the 2012 Festival included a programme entitled European Connections, including a new work for voice and piano trio by Vasco Mendon√ßa. =Aldeburgh Alumni= Aldeburgh Alumni is a network of artists including past participants in the Britten‚ÄìPears Young Artist Programme. Each year, Alumni are given showcases at the Aldeburgh Festival, and as part of an exchange programme, at the Festival of Aix-en-Provence. =Jerwood Opera Writing Programme= The Jerwood Opera Writing Programme develops new work in the field of opera. The first Jerwood Opera Writing Foundation, led by Artistic Advisor Giorgio Battistelli and a distinguished faculty of experienced practitioners, featured three week-long workshops in March, July and October 2007. Ten of the participants were composers, mostly at the start of a professional career but with little or no experience in writing opera, while the remaining participants were a mix of poets, playwrights and directors with an interest in, but no experience at that stage of, writing libretti. In 2010, the second Jerwood Opera Writing Foundation course began, involving composers, writers and directors both in the UK and worldwide. The participants, twenty composers, writers and directors, took part in three week-long workshop-led courses at Snape Maltings in November 2010, March and July 2011. The workshops mixed practical exercises, theory and discussion, with contributions from teachers including Harrison Birtwistle, Stephen Langridge, Stephen Plaice, David Sawer, Lavinia Greenlaw, Jonathan Dove and Orlando Gough amongst others, and culminated in performances of mini music-theatre works created by the twenty participants. At the end of November 2011, Aldeburgh Music invited applications for Jerwood Opera Writing Fellowships from composers and writers and their collaborators who wanted to develop a particular opera project for commission and performance. Fellowships were to give support during the development of a new opera by providing a collaborative, supportive environment, as well as financial and practical support and expertise, such as workshops and mentoring. Over sixty applications were submitted from countries worldwide and the following four proposals were each awarded a Jerwood Opera Writing Fellowship: Knots and Do-Nots ‚Äì composer Sasha Siem and director Ted Huffman; Pleasure ‚Äì composer Mark Simpson and writer Melanie Challenger; Thanatophobia ‚Äì composer Joanna Lee and writer Hannah Silva; and Beyond the Pale ‚Äì composer Benjamin Scheuer, writer Tom Swift and director Tom Creed. =Aldeburgh Education= Over 8,000 young people participate in Education projects each year. The latest initiative is Group A, a non-audition choir for young people of between the ages of 13 and 18, and The Big Shout, an opportunity for members of the community to come together to sing. Aldeburgh Education also devises training in participatory settings for artists at all levels. Aldeburgh Education has been working with Suffolk County Council since 1987, and has been a lead partner in the Suffolk Music Education Hub since 2012. It has worked with HM YOI Warren Hill since 1999, and with Lapwing, an organisation providing individual learning programmes for young people who have complex barriers to learning, since 2009, as well as with a variety of local and national arts organizations around the UK and beyond including the development of audio/visual interactive media. =Aldeburgh Young Musicians= Aldeburgh Young Musicians (AYM) was created to fill the perceived gap in Aldeburgh Music‚Äôs engagement with the musical development of younger people. Funded by the Department of Education, each of 45 young musicians between the ages of 8 and 18 has a tailored, individual learning programme, which co- ordinates individual lessons, intensive weekends and residential holiday courses, expert professional advice, mentoring and performance opportunities. Individual students are matched to tutors for additional tuition which can be done on-line. AYM works in partnership with Suffolk County Council Music Service, Pro Corda, Junior Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Purcell School. In 2011/12, new strands were added to the Aldeburgh Young Musicians programme: AYM Apprentices for younger students who have shown musical talent and potential but need further musical support and development before joining the main scheme; AYM Open House providing the opportunity to Aldeburgh Young Musicians to use rehearsal facilities with other AYMs, provide a venue for individual lessons or master-classes, a private practice space and specialist coaching days; and AYM Exchanging Worlds Ensemble, launched for the Cultural Olympiad 2012. This commissioning group is cross cultural and cross genre in content, working collaboratively and exchanging global musical conversations. Connected to the Aldeburgh World Orchestra and Cultural Olympiad, two AYM composers were commissioned to create a new fanfare to be performed by the Aldeburgh World Orchestra brass section for the Olympic Torch Relay, performed when the Relay travelled to Aldeburgh and Ipswich on 5 July 2012. =Faster than Sound= Faster than Sound is a strand of activity, supported by the Paul Hamlyn and Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundations, exploring connections between traditional music and new media, developing new collaborations between experimental musicians from different backgrounds, including electronic and classical. Starting in 2006 with performances in disused hangars at RAF Bentwaters, Faster than Sound, co-produced with Joana Seguro from Lumin, is now based in the Hoffmann Building at Snape Maltings. Since 2009, there have been five week-long residencies each year, culminating in a performance. Recent presentations include I Burn for You, a new music theatre piece based on Dracula, by Ian Wilson (composer) and Tom Creed (director); Symmetry with Marcus du Sautoy and Fall Back connecting the legacy of Dubstep with some of the earliest experiments in electronic music and projection. During the 2012 Aldeburgh Festival, choral ensemble EXAUDI teamed up with sound artist Bill Thompson and students from the University of East Anglia and presented a promenade performance in the Hoffmann Building of John Cage‚Äôs Song Books. Other Faster than Sound projects in 2012 include Star-Shaped Biscuit, text and music by David Toop, which will be performed in one of the remaining semi- derelict buildings at Snape Maltings. Later in 2012, composer Richard Baker and sound artist Brian Duffy collaborate on a new work exploring the hidden voices of electronic toys and toy instruments in combination with a small chamber ensemble. =TEDx Aldeburgh= TED is a US-led non-profit organisation devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It brings together in international conferences, people from the worlds of Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED). Aldeburgh Music hosted the inaugural TEDx Aldeburgh Conference on November 6, 2010. Hosted by the TED music director Thomas Dolby and produced by Joana Seguro as an opportunity of having in one place great minds and explorers of contemporary music, the event featured talks by David Toop, Tod Machover, Martyn Ware, William Orbit, Tim Exile, Imogen Heap, Ash Nehru of United Visual Artists. In addition, there were TED talk videos from David Byrne, Itay Talgam, Evelyn Glennie and Benjamin Zander. The gathering of people and ideas coincided with Aldeburgh‚Äôs New Music New Media course for emerging professional composers and musicians, led by Tod Machover. The second conference was held on 5 November 2011 when the speakers included Vincent Walsh, Peter Gregson, Kingslee Daly, Jennifer Stumm, Nitin Sawhney, Kathy Hinde and the Modified Toy Orchestra. =Visual Arts: SNAP= The Aldeburgh Festival has always included the visual arts as well as music, and a number of exhibitions are curated each year to accompany the music programme. From 2011, the main exhibition of contemporary art has been promoted under the title SNAP, at various locations around the Snape Maltings site, organized by Abigail Lane. In 2012, featured artists included Glenn Brown, May Cornet, Brian Eno, Ryan Gander, Maggi Hambling, Mark Limbrick, Emily Richardson and Gavin Turk. Aldeburgh Music is also responsible for running the Peter Pears Gallery in Aldeburgh and the Pond Gallery at Snape Maltings. For most of the year these galleries are hired out to local artists, but provide the space for Aldeburgh Music-curated exhibitions during the Aldeburgh Festival. People The first Artistic Directors of the Aldeburgh Festival were Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears and Eric Crozier. Britten and Pears remained Artistic Directors until their respective deaths, in 1976 and 1986. After Britten died, the artistic direction of the Festival was shared; many world-class musicians joined the artistic team, including at various times Philip Ledger, Colin Graham, Steuart Bedford, Mstislav Rostropovich, Murray Perahia, Simon Rattle, John Shirley-Quirk and Oliver Knussen. In 1999, a sole Artistic Director in the Britten mould ‚Äì composer, solo performer, accompanist and conductor ‚Äì was appointed in Thomas Ad√®s, joined in 2004 by composer John Woolrich, first as Guest Artistic Director then as an Associate Artistic Director. Ad√®s had first appeared at an Aldeburgh Festival as a member of the Britten‚ÄìPears Young Artist Programme on the New Music course in 1992. Ad√®s was succeeded by Pierre-Laurent Aimard in 2009, again supported by John Woolrich. Oliver Knussen returned for the 2012 Festival as Artist in Residence. Chief executive of Aldeburgh Music from 1998 to 2014 was Jonathan Reekie, who left in spring 2014 to become Director of Somerset House Trust. He was succeeded by Roger Wright, the former Controller of BBC Radio 3, who took up the post in September 2014. The current Chairman of the Aldeburgh Music Council is Sir Simon Robey. The President of Aldeburgh Music is the Lord Stevenson of Coddenham CBE, Aldeburgh Music Chairman from 2000 to 2012. Music The Britten‚ÄìPears Library holds an archive of programmes dating back to 1948. Aldeburgh Music has commissioned and presented many world premieres over the years, starting with many of Britten‚Äôs own compositions from 1948. A selection of composers whose works have been premiered by Aldeburgh Music include Thomas Ad√®s, Gerald Barry, Richard Rodney Bennett, Harrison Birtwistle, Elliott Carter, Jonathan Dove, Deirdre Gribbin, Oliver Knussen, Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g, Nicola LeFanu, Colin Matthews, Thea Musgrave, Dmitri Shostakovich and John Tavener. Facilities Aldeburgh Music is based at Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Snape, Saxmundham, Suffolk. It now has a 999-year lease, negotiated with the overall site owners, Johnny and Alesha Gooderham, in 2006, on all its facilities at Snape Maltings. Snape Maltings Concert Hall is an 830-seat international concert hall, converted from a redundant Victorian malthouse in 1967. The Concert Hall incorporates a Restaurant and the Oyster Bar, and displays exhibitions in the Concert Hall Gallery. A Visitor Centre off the main foyer houses the Box Office, an information point and a shop. The Hoffmann Building, converted from semi-derelict malting and storage buildings adjacent to the Concert Hall, was opened in 2009 and houses the Britten Studio (340 capacity), the Jerwood Kiln Studio (80 capacity), the Foyle and the Weinrebe Studios, as well as office and circulation space. The Britten-Pears Building was converted from an old barley store in 1979 to create the Britten‚ÄìPears School for Advanced Musical Studies, now renamed the Britten‚ÄìPears Young Artist Programme. The building contains the Peter Pears Recital Room (120 capacity) and a number of practice and seminar rooms, and the Holst Library. Adjacent is the Trask Artists' Cafe. The Pond Gallery is a small art gallery, let to local artists, and adjacent is a long room currently known as Building 19, awaiting further development. In Aldeburgh itself, Aldeburgh Music has a full-time Box Office on the High Street, and runs the Peter Pears Gallery and The Pumphouse. During the Festival, performances are presented at the Jubilee Hall and the Aldeburgh Parish Church, as well as other venues around Suffolk including the churches of Orford and Blythburgh. Site-specific events have been held in a number of locations, including Aldeburgh and Sizewell beaches, Bentwaters Airbase, and Leiston Long Shop Museum.

Most of the residents are minority Sri Lankan Tamils and are farmers. According to local chronicles, Veeramunai was founded by early Mukkuva settlers in a medieval feudal division called Nadukadu during the pre colonial period (prior to 1505 CE). Feudal lords known as Vanniar resident in the village controlled large swaths of farm land around the village and the region. These farm holdings led to considerable conflicts with residents of a demographically larger nearby town of Sammanthurai. Most residents of Sammathurai were exclusively members of the Sri Lankan Muslim minority. In 1954, a mob from Sammanthurai burned down Veeramunai after a local conflict. About 75% of the villagers left Veeramunai as refugees and setup satellite settlements like Malwattai, Kanapathipuram and Veerachcholai away from Sammanthurai. Veeramunai land holdings were eventually sold to the residents of Sammanthurai thus the village reduced in size and population considerably. During the 1990s life was affected by the insurgency and counter insurgency operations during the Sri Lankan civil war. Members of the village were also present within the Hindu temple at Veeramunai as refugees when it was attacked by Home Guards from Sammanthurai on August 12, 1990 resulting in the death of 55 civilians.
